 Forstal Farm is one of the few farms  
 around here which is not owned by Wye 
 College.  It is owned by Mr and Mrs   
 Long.  The farmwife, Mrs Long, leads  
 quite a hard life.  She works for     
 about twelve hours a day.  She is     
 especially busy in the Spring as most 
 of their farm is given over to sheep  
 and she has to keep checking that the 
 sheep are  alright.  When we walked   
 over the farm with her we helped to   
 bring a new lamb into the world.      
 I(Katie) put my foot on the sheep's   
 neck while Mrs Long put her hand up   
 the sheeps bottom and pulled out the  
 lamb.  Often the lambs get tangled up 
 in the electric fence, we found one   
 and its leg was injured and now it    
 will have to be a sock lamb because   
 its mother doesnt want it.            </content>
