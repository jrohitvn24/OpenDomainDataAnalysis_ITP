		<content>   Brackley Town Hall is a large       
rectangular building with two floors   
and a clock tower with a bell which    
rings every hour. It was built in 1705-
1707 by the Duke of Bridgwater and was 
constructed on arches which provided a 
covered market area. But in 1884 the   
lower part was enclosed and used as a  
corn exchange.                         
   In the Town Hall, the ground floor  
and the first floor have large halls   
which people can hire for plays, dances
etc.. There is also an office for the  
Town Clerk on the first floor.         
   To get to the loft, you climb up a  
spiral staircase. Then you can see the 
huge "queen" beams which support the   
roof. A final and very steep flight of 
stairs takes you to the little cabin   
behind the clock faces. Here you can   
hear the clock ticking and watch the   
mechanism.                             </content>
