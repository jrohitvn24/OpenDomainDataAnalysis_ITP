		<content> Blackpool Pleasure Beach claims to be 
 the largest outdoor amusement park in 
 Europe.  It takes its name from the   
 fact that it was originally sited on  
 the beach.  The ground is now owned by
 the Pleasure Beach Company.  They own 
 most of the buildings and some of the 
 rides.  They also rent out sites on   
 which other people put rides.  In     
 addition to the rides there are many  
 other attractions.  The Ice Drome has 
 an Ice Show during the Summer Season. 
 Blackpool Seagulls Ice Hockey Team    
 also use the Ice Drome for their      
 matches.  Unlike the rides the Ice    
 Drome is open all year.  Near the main
 entrance of the Pleasure Beach is the 
 White Tower Restaurant and Horseshoe  
 Cabaret Bar, there are also several   
 public bars and amusment arcades.  The
 oldest ride is Sir Maxim's Flying     
 Machine the newest the Space Invader. </content>
