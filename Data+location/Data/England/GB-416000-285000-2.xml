		<title>02A day in my life</title>
		<content> It was a Saturday and I had come back 
 from a camping trip. I had to do the  
 washing! and ironing! I just          
 remembered I had to go to the barber's
 appointment. I went to the shop. The  
 lady wet my hair and I heard her      
 cutting off my hair. I got out of the 
 shop and did some shopping. I got     
 home. I started on the washing. The   
 electricity went. I put 50p in and    
 the dog bit my leg. I did the washing 
 and then I hung it on the line then I 
 did the ironing. I had a wash and then
 went out at six o'clock. I went to a  
 restaurant. I had wine and a hot      
 Indian curry. I had more wine. I got  
 home. I tidied up and washed up. I had
 a wash and got my book of jokes and   
 read it until I fell asleep.
