            Clipston School 1900       
  The village children all went to     
Clipston School, where there was a     
very strict headmaster named Mr. Wale  
  They all wore a type of uniform      
comprising of lace up boots, leggins,  
which we now call gaiters, and the     
girls wore a white apron over their    
dresses to keep them clean.  They all  
had to attend school six days a week,  
Monday to Saturday, from 9 o'clock to  
4 o'clock each day.  At 14 they left   
school, unless their family could      
afford to continue their education.    
  In 1900 the present school building  
only housed the boys.  The girls were  
taught, alongside the infants in the   
building that is now the village hall. 
  The cane was an acceptable form of   
punishment for naughty children in     
those days.                            </content>
