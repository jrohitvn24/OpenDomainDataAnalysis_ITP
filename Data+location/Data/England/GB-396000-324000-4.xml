		<title>04   INGESTRE CHURCH</title>
		<content>    The present church of St. Mary the 
Virgin had been built to the design    
of Sir Christopher Wren in 1671. Inside
the church there are many stained glass
windows. Many of these had been added  
when Walter Chetwynd built the church  
in 1671, but four of the windows are   
made of stained glass from  the        
earlier church.                        
  Walter Chetwynd had requested from   
the d Archbishop to build the church   
which was under the controversy.The    
petition which was sent was signed     
by three friends of Chetwynd and only  
one parishioner.                       
The religion of Ingestre Church is     
C.of E.The minister is the Reverend    
E.Townsend,unless there is either a    
funeral,marrriage or baptism.There     
are many inscriptions refering to      
the past Earls of Shrewsbury.
