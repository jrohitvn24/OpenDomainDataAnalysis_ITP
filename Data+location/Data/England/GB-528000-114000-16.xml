		<content>  Between Burgess Hill and Hassocks are
 fields. Some of the fields are used   
 for cattle and others for growing     
 cereals and grass to make hay for use 
 during the winter.                    
  There is one herd of forty-six cattle
 divided between two fields; eleven in 
 one and thirty-five in the other. They
 are bullocks and heifers.             
  The majority of the fields are used  
 for growing barley. The fields are    
 divided by hawthorn hedges and barbed 
 wire fences. The gates are made of    
 wood or metal. There is a track       
 through the fields that is also a     
 public footpath. One of the fields    
 with cows in it backs on to private   
 gardens. The farmer regularly checks  
 the fences for poisonous plants that  
 the cattle might eat.
