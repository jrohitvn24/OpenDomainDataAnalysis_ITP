		<content> Forhill House is a small pocket  of   
 Kings Norton Parish administered by   
 B'ham City Council.The house &amp; grounds
 provide a beautiful view of the       
 countryside, not always enjoyed by    
 those offenders who are city boys.It  
 is  a large rambling Victorian house  
 with many later additions, surrounded 
 by outbuildings adapted as workshops. 
 A staff of 40 teach and care for off- 
 enders during their stay.The Centre   
 caters for boys aged 15-21 for a min- 
 imum period of 3 weeks assessment.Some
 offenders stay a maximum of 9 months. 
 The teaching staff prefer longer than 
 3 weeks to assess the boys' suitabil- 
 ities for training &amp; to get to know   
 personalities.Although Forhill is a   
 secure house there are opportunities  
 for physical outlets in the garden,   
 workshops &amp; sports hall.{Silvermead}
