		<content>{The following is an extract of life   
in Chelsfield in 1921.}                
 .."Life in Chelsfield Village in 1921 
was so very different from what it is  
today.Practically all our entertainment
centred around the life and activities 
of the village.For the younger there   
were the Scouts and Guides, for the    
older members of the community there   
was the newly founded Womens Institute 
or the Chelsfield Players....Chelsfield
was very much a farming community with 
well known names like Whitehead,Miller,
Smith and Foreman.Mr.G.J.Miller was    
better known in those days as a wheel- 
wright who made and patented a special 
non-slip wheel for agricultural work." 
{Credits}                              
All work was written and supplied by   
the children of Chelsfield and members 
of the local community.
