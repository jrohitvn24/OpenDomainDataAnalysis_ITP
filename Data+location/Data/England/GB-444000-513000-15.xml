		<title>15THORNABY INDUSTRIAL ESTATE</title>
		<content> Thornaby industrial estate covers an  
 area of approximately 3 square km. and
 is built on land previously used for  
 farming.There are  35 to 40 different 
 factories which produce a wide variety
 of goods including high technology,   
 electronic goods such as computers and
 other manufactured goods such as      
 lamposts,floor coverings, games,      
 kitchens, watches, and pet food etc.  
 Some of the units provide services    
 such as British telephone systems  and
 car van hire.Some companies have been 
 given loans or grants to help them to 
 start up.They have chosen Thornaby for
 a number of reasons.One manager said  
 it was nicer to be in the countryside,
 and also that it had easy access.     
 There are a number of factories under 
 construction but over 1/3 is still    
 avalibale for constrution of new      
 factories.                            </content>
