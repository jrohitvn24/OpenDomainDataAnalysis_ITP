The area is largely farmland with the  
villages being found in the SE corner  
of the block. There is evidence of a   
settlement in this position for at     
least 1900 years, the site of the      
original 'Haiwode' probably being what 
we now call Colwich. The villages have 
been by-passed with a new road in      
recent years, considerably reducing    
the amount of traffic through the      
villages. Approaching the villages     
along the A51 they are well hidden on  
the hills beside the Trent Valley.     
There has been much development here   
during the last twenty years: Great    
Haywood expanded to its present size   
during the late 1960's and new         
property is still being built in       
Little Haywood. Close to Haywood is    
Cannock Chase, and the home of the     
Earl of Lichfield at Shugborough.      </content>
