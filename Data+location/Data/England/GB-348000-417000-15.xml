		<title>15THE RECTOR OF ECCLESTON</title>
		<content>{Rev Peter Aspden}has been Rector of   
 St. Mary's, Eccleston for 6years when 
 he{succeeded Rev. Dick Bretherton     
{Hawkshead-Talbot,}rector from 1958 to 
 1978 and who had himself succeeded his
 brother, rector from 1919 to 1958.    
 He lives in new{rectory}built in      
 alongside the older 18th C one now    
 known as Eccleston Hall.              
 He is chairman of governors of{St.    
{Mary's CE Primary School,}vice-       
 president of the local cricket club   
 and takes a keen interest in local    
 affairs.                              
 He takes three church services on     
 Sundays but the numbers coming are    
 less than they used to be; he said    
 that children are losing interest in  
 the Church. Working with children,    
 taking communion services and sick and
 hospital visiting give him most       
 satisfaction.                         </content>
