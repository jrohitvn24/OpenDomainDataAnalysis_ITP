		<title>20Coleshill: A Rural Village.</title>
		<content> Coleshill is a rural village, it is   
 miles from anywhere .It has very nice 
 countryside around and is just        
 inside Oxfordshire. The buildings     
 are made from Cotswold stone and there
 is only one shop in the village, that 
 is the Post Office. The boundary is   
 the river Cole which divides the two  
 counties of Oxfordshire and Wiltshire.
 All the people who live in Coleshill  
 are very nice and kind. There are     
 about 170 people who live in          
 Coleshill. There used to be a school  
 in Coleshill but because there were   
 not enough children living there to   
 keep it open, it has now closed.      
 Instead of the school, there is now a 
 playgroup with toddlers between the   
 ages of two and five who come from    
 Faringdon, Lechlade and Highworth as  
 well as Coleshill.
