		<title>18Life in Penberth, St. Levan.</title>
		<content> My name is Jane Matthews, I am ten    
 years old. Every day I wake up at     
 about half past six. My dad is up at  
 about four o'clock. He is a fisherman.
 Here in Penberth I live near the sea. 
 Out of my window I can see the sea and
 in my other window I can see the slip.
 Every morning I get up at seven       
 o'clock. I go down stairs and have    
 breakfast. Then I wash with my little 
 brother. My brother is only two and is
 called Thomas. My sister, Tracy, is   
 fourteen and goes to St. Just school. 
 My dad is called Richard and my mum is
 called Jackie. When I am dressed and  
 ready for school I go and get Harry   
 who is six and walks up the road with 
 me. We get picked up by a taxi. At    
 Porthcurno we pick up Richard, Helen, 
 James and Rupert. School is at Bottoms
 it starts at nine o'clock and finishes
 at 3-30p.m. I like to swim in summer. </content>
