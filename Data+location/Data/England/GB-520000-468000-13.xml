		<title>13MARTON HALL</title>
		<content> This is a private school in a large   
 old house. The grounds are made up of 
 45 acres of grass and trees. There is 
 a pond which is a kettle hole, known  
 also as a marton from which the school
 derives its name. When we went inside 
 the school we saw the classroom and   
 dormitories. The classrooms were very 
 old fashioned. The children sit in    
 desks in rows facing the teacher who  
 is on a raised platform. Teaching is  
 subject based and includes            
 mathematics, English, French,         
 geography, history, chemistry,        
 physics, biology, RE, art, PE and     
 games. There are 5 classes of 10      
 children of which 12 are girls. The   
 dormitories have bunk beds with       
 quilts. There are about 10 children in
 each room. The children say the food  
 is very good. There is a heated       
 swimming pool. The age range is 6-14. </content>
