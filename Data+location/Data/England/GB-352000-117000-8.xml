		<content>  All the equipment in                 
 Larkhill is                           
 driven by Electricity and the heating 
 by steam,produced by oil or gas heated
 boilers.                              
  The Rubber is mixed in a machine     
 called the{'Banbury'}and the batch of 
 fifteen different materials weighing  
 230 kilos is mixed every 5 minutes.   
 This mixed compound is then sheeted   
 off and subjected to further processes
 known as moulding.The moulding process
 is by means of presses which squeeze  
 the compound into shape and vulcanize 
 by means of heat.Vulcanisation is a   
 chemical change which converts the    
 compounds from a Plastercine like     
 material into a Rubber.Substitute     
 suitable for shoe soles.
