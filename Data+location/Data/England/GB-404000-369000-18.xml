 We decided to do a survey of the      
 pupils who live in the study area in  
 the Lower School of Buxton Girls'     
 School.{9%}lived there; just under    
 half (19) replied to our questionaire.
 11 had lived in their house for more  
 than 5 years and 15 went to Harpur    
 Hill Junior School. 8 lived on the    
 Barrett housing estate and 3 in       
 council houses. Most houses had 3     
 bedrooms and only 1 had 4 bedrooms.   
 16 girls had between 4 &amp; 6 people     
 living in their home; 6 was the       
 largest number and 2 the lowest. All  
 but 3 girls had pets; some had        
 several. Cats(10) &amp; dogs(10) were most
 popular. There were 3 hampsters, 5    
 goldfish, a rabbit, tortoise &amp; a      
 budgie. There were 9 Anglicans, 1     
 Methodist &amp; 9 did not go to church.
