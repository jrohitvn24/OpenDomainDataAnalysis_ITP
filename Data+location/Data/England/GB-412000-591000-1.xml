		<content> Beacon Hill, once a vantage point is  
 now covered with deciduous trees. Here
 ambushes were prepared and in 1586    
 Robert Clavering was killed while     
 travelling with brother, the Sherif.  
 The stump of a memorial cross still   
 stands nr Stanton House. The area has 
 scattered farms, the fields divided by
 hedges, Drainage has improved the     
 land-pasture for sheep and cattle,with
 a milking herd at Whinney Hill. Once  
 there was mining and quarrying, but   
 trees cover the sites. Altogether the 
 area presents a pleasant rural        
 landscape with distant views to the   
 hills, th urban complex and the sea.  
 Devils Causeway, a Roman road from    
 Carbridge to Berwick, crosses the area
 and ws much used before enclosures    
 took place. It is plainly visible over
 Todburn Moor.
