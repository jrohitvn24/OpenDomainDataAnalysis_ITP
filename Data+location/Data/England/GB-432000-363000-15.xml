 Walton went to see an old lady called 
 Mrs Featherstone.She has lived in     
 Ashover for along time,and has seen   
 many changes in Ashover.She said      
 that  the Parish Room was once the    
  village school.The school she went to
 was  Stavley,it was very strict .She  
 did not wear school uniform.Mrs       
 Featherstone also told us that she    
 had not lived in Rose Cottage all her 
 life.They entertained them selves at  
 night by playing buttons and dominoes.
 When Mrs Fearthstone was little she   
 did not have a T.V.The food was very  
 different in the olden days, because  
 they had bread and jam without butter 
 but we have bread, butter and jam.They
 could not have butter because their   
 family had 14 children and they all   
 had to be fed on 1 wage.Also they did 
 not have family allowence in their day</content>
