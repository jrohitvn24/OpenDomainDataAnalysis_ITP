		<content> Burglary is the most common serious   
 crime in the village.  It occurs more 
 in the summer and near to Christmas.  
 In the village the average number of  
 break ins is about 3.  They happen in 
 many types of buildings.  Holmes      
 Chapel is near the M6 and is a        
 prosperous area so it is an ideal     
 target for thieves.                   
 Just about everybody who owns a car   
 drives it too quickly.  Road accidents
 vary according to the weather (on     
 average about 70 per year).           
 Victims of assaults are mainly old    
 people.  Young people tend to commit  
 this crime.  Suicides have been quite 
 rare in the village.  About 3_4 have  
 happened in the past year.            
 There are five policemen in the       
 village who try to make it as safe as 
 possible for everyone.
