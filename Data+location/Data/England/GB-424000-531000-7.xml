		<title>07A Typical Morning -by a Mam.</title>
		<content> My day begins trying to get the       
 children out of bed, if I start at 7am
 I know they will be downstairs by 8am.
 Breakfast is cereal and a hot drink   
 and then there is a mad half hour when
 everything that is needed has grown   
 legs and disappeared! The peace and   
 quiet after they have gone to school  
 is heaven. I have a quick snack of    
 coffee and biscuits before cleaning   
 the house. My system seems to work, I 
 tidy and straighten the living room so
 if callers come we can sit in there   
 and chat. I then clean the kitchen and
 pop the laundry in the washing machine
 where it can look after itself. I get 
 my youngest son ready and go to town  
 where I buy what is needed for that   
 days meals. If time is on my side I go
 to the library to browse, hardback    
 books are so expensive so borrowing   
 them is a real pleasure for me.       </content>
