		<content> These cupmarks suggest that originally
 it had some association with a        
 primitive form of worship.On the      
 northern face,seven inches from the   
 top is the inscription "PERRON DU     
 ROY".Below these letters are other    
 letters which are believed to have    
 been cut somewhere around 1720.       
                                       
 Besides the perron du roi, there was  
 supposed to be another menhir which   
 stood by the Gouffre and was probably 
 a statue menhir,representing the earth
 goddess.Because of its associations   
 with pagan worship,the area was       
 thought to be haunted by werewolves,  
 (the road name "Variouf" tells us this
 ).As well as the werewolves and the   
 menhirs,the area was patrolled by a   
 dog of death (a legendary guardian of 
 pagan stones and tombs).
