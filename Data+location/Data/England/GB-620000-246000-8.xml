		<content> Each village has its own parish       
 Council and is within Suffolk Coastl  
 District council, which is in turn    
 within Suffolk County Council.  The   
 Parish Council is elected every three 
 years, with by-elections is necessary,
 and is able to levy a small rate to   
 cover street lighting and local       
 amenities.  Their council meetings are
 open to the public to attend but few  
 bother to do so.  Parish noticeboards 
 are placed in strategic positions.  In
 Playford and Bealings the respectie   
 parish councils manage their village  
 halls, and the latter a children's    
 playground.  Rush-mere has landscaped 
 a pond with seats nearby as a leisure 
 area.  The primary school is          
 administered by the County Council.   
 The nearest DHSS office is in Ipswich,
 the Job Centre for the area in        
 woodbridge.                           </content>
