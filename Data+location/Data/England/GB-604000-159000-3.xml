		<title>03FARMING IN BOUGHTON</title>

   We were fascinated to find a close  
 relationship between soil types and   
 crops grown.For instance,hops were    
 only found in areas containing Brick- 
 earth.London Clay was nearly all wood-
 land with a little rough pasture.     
 However,the two kilometre blocks 0560 
 and 0561 contain a mixture of all the 
 soil types except London Clay ,and    
 here market gardening abounds.        
   Orchards grow happily on Brick-     
 earth,Alluvium and Oldhaven Beds.It is
 no wonder that farming is the major   
 industry of this area.                
   Probably the two most famous crops  
 of this district are hops and         
 cherries.Others are,apples,pears,straw
 -berries,potatoes,lettuce,soft fruit  
 and brassicas.More about farming can  
 be found on page four.
