		<content> Living in the country has become more 
 and more expensive over the past few  
 years.With the increase in oil in the 
 70s petrol prices have increased and  
 road tax per year is now Â£100 each    
 car.Public transport has been axed and
 there is now no village bus through   
 Cadeleigh.We are very lucky in that we
 still have our sub_postoffice and     
 telephone kiosk and there have been   
 fears that these will go ,leaving the 
 old people in a difficult situation.In
 years to come it may be a sad fact of 
 life that country living will be      
 solely for the rich and healthy.
