		<content>{The Library}was built in 1928. It was 
 first used as a museum then became a  
 library. These are the staff; Ann,    
 Betty, Margaret and Judith. Ann has   
 been with the library for 22 years and
 working in Tilbury library for 14     
 years. The oldest book in the library 
 is about{Essex}and was printed in     
 1909. There are{8300 books}altogether 
 and 268 records. Every year around    
 Â£2600 to Â£3000 is spent on books.     
 There are 1569 adult ticket holders   
 and 2513 junior ticket holders. Every 
 day 300 to 400 books are taken out.   
 The three main jobs are; stamping     
 books out,counting stock and putting  
 books back on the shelves. The        
 non-fiction books use the{DEWEY}      
 system, the fiction is arranged       
 alphabetically. There are,            
 suprisingly, more children than adults
 using the library!                    </content>
