		<title>11TOURISM IN BUNGAY</title>
		<content>Bungay is visited through the year by  
English and European tourists.The      
majority of tourists come during the   
summer,stay from 1-4 days.Some families
stay for weekend breaks.Honeymoon      
couples also stay at Bungay.The age of 
tourists ranges from 30-60 years.We    
think that young people don't come to  
Bungay because there's not enough      
exciting attractions such as a swimming
pool in Bungay.In the peak season      
hundreds of people come and visit the  
castle,the museum,the Flixton air      
museum and the nationally famous otter 
trust.The otter trust is in Earsham.   
They collect otters from the wild and  
breed them in the trust.There are also 
other animals and birds.It is stongly  
felt that Bungay should have a swimming
pool,art museum and signposts to       
advertise exciting places.
