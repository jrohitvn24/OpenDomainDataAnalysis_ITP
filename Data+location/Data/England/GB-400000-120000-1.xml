		<title>01BOWERCHALKE PARISH</title>
		<content> The area covers the southeast part of 
 the village of BOWERCHALKE            
 (Population: 109) and 66% of its      
 Parish (Total population 296).        
 Northeast is larger Broadchalke, 2    
 miles away - a separate Parish and    
 competitive. Southwards are Dorset and
 Hampshire borders with separate Local 
 Government Services &amp; access to a Main
 Road. WOODMINTON is a hamlet on the   
 Northwest side with little individual 
 identity now. The main area is        
 FARMLAND. DOWNS cover the undulating  
 scarp face of MARLEYCOMBE &amp; KNOWLE    
 HILLS, rising sharply to about 675ft. 
 Their unique quality is safeguarded by
 designation as sites of Special       
 Scientific Interest.                  
 Vernditch Chase is mainly deciduous   
 woodland managed by the Forestry      
 Commission. There are many Bridleways 
 &amp; Footpaths.                          </content>
