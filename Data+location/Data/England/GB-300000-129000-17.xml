		<content> One of the local estate agents gave us
 an idea of the value of land and      
 property in the area.                 
 Farmland costs about Â£750 to Â£1000 per
 acre amd the farm buildings would be  
 extra as would any stock.             
 The demand for holiday homes in the   
 area seems to have dropped off a      
 little at present although some are   
 still being looked for.               
 A semi-derelict cottage needing       
 modernisation can be bought for about 
 Â£20 000 while a good three bedroomed  
 one will cost Â£30 000.                
 There is now a lack of tied cottages  
 as they have either been bought as    
 holiday homes as farms have been      
 bought up or they have been allowed to
 simply fall down as they have become  
 unoccupied.                           
                                       
                                       </content>
