		<title>15  STONEBRIDGE POND,FAVERSHAM</title>
		<content>   The West Brook flows from the {Chart
Gunpowder Mills} into {Stonebridge     
Pond.}When the gunpowder industry      
closed down in Faversham,the Pond      
was preserved as an amenity for local  
people and a popular attraction for    
visitors.It is a beautiful scene with  
trees and bushes reflected in the      
water.{Davington Church} lies on       
the hill overlooking the Pond which    
is a home for wild birds.There is a    
pair of swans,some coots and many      
mallards,all with young.People come    
with bread to feed the ducks.There are 
not so many ducks this year,due to     
injuries and a severely cold winter.   
 Local residents have been keeping a   
close watch on the pond to ensure      
the safety of the birds so that the    
pond will continue to be an attractive 
and interesting place to visit.
