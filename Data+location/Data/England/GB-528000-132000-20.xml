 We are children from the top 2 classes
 of the school. While the other        
 children were away on a school trip to
 North Wales we went out and about in  
 our D_Block collecting information for
 the Domesday project. We visited all  
 the places we have written about and  
 also went horseriding at Balcombe     
 stables which is just south of our    
 area. The pony that Scott rode had    
 been ridden by Princess Margaret's 2  
 children when they were young.        </content>
