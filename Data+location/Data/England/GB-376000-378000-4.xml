		<title>04LONGRIDGE ESTATE, KNUTSFORD</title>
		<content>      The Longridge Estate was built in
 the late 1960's.  There are about 400 
 houses and flats, all brick built with
 tiled roofs.  The houses belong to    
 Manchester City Council and most of   
 the people who live here came from    
 Manchester.                           
      In the centre of the estate there
 is a public house, 3 shops and a      
 doctor's surgery. The shops are a     
 newsagents, a supermarket, a take-away
 food shop. Our school is at one end of
 the estate and children from Shaw     
 Heath estate also come here.  At the  
 other end is a small trading estate   
 which houses small businesses such as 
 printing and advertising, kitchen     
 furniture making, tyre and battery    
 sales and a Chinese owned firm making 
 louvre doors.                         
      There is a grass play area which 
 we don't use very much.               </content>
