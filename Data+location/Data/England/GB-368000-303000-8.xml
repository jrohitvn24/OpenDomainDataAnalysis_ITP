		<title>08SHOPPING IN MADELEY</title>
		<content> There are lots of shops in Madeley.I  
 like the paper shop because they sell 
 sweets as well as newspapers and      
 comics.I like sweets.My favourite     
 sweet is bubble gum.You can blow      
 bubbles with it while you eat it.I    
 like chocolate as well.               
 I like the sports shop.There they sell
 footballs and football boots and      
 gloves.I can buy my games kit from    
 there too.                            
 Sometimes I go to the supermarket with
 my mum.If she has a lot to buy she    
 uses a trolley.When I was little I    
 used to ride in the trolley while she 
 pushed it round the shop.We usually go
 shopping on Saturday morning.We can   
 get all our food in the supermarket.My
 mum buys enough meat for all the      
 week.She keeps it in the freezer at   
 home.We buy fresh vegetables for the  
 weekend,and have frozen in the week.  </content>
