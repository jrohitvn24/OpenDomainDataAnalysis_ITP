picturesque backwater &amp; has an         
interesting timber-framed pub Ye Old

the nearset shops are 1 mile away in   
Sturry, which makes difficulties for   
older residents.There are 2 public     
telephones, at either end of the       
village &amp; 2 post boxes with 2 daily    
collections.Building is carefully
