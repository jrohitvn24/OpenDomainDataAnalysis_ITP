		<title>13A VILLAGE MUM'S DAY - 1</title>
		<content>  The bedroom is bright and the birds  
 are lovely are lovely to listen to.   
 The alarm hasn't gone off yet - it's  
 nice to have 5 minutes to oneself.    
 With a husband, 2 daughters (aged 8 &amp; 
 5) and a large dog to look after I    
 appreciate the first few peaceful     
 minutes of the day. The alarm rings so
 it's straight to the bathroom and then
 the kettle is put on before I start my
 caretaking job at the village school. 
   I open up all the classrooms and put
 the the rubbish out (it's Monday). I  
 return home to my first cup of tea and
 take a cup to my husband who is going 
 on a residential course for his firm  
 today. The girls are coming downstairs
 now, sleepy eyed and slipperless, for 
 their breafast of juice, cereal and   
 toast. The blue school dresses are now
 put on, teeth and hair brushed (not   
 with the same brush) the goldfish fed.</content>
