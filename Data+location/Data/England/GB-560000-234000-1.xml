		<title>01THE SAMPFORDS.</title>
		<content> This rectangle lies to the west of    
 the centre of the village of          
 Gt.Sampford.It is a very rural area   
 consisting mainly of farmland.There   
 are several farmhouses in the area and
 many of these are moated.There is very
 little evidence of roads in this      
 district. There is a country lane     
 which joins the farms, to  the        
 west of the rectangle which leads to  
 the neighbouring village of           
 Radwinter.The main road from          
 Gt.Sampford to Radwinter lies to the  
 north-east of the rectangle.In the    
 south_west are several small          
 greens.These are just east of the     
 village of Wimbish.There is evidence  
 of a disused airfield towards the     
 south of the rectangle.This land is   
 now used for farming.The River Pant   
 runs through this part of The         
 Sampfords.                            </content>
