		<title>14South Moreton Mill</title>
		<content>There were apparently two mills along  
the Mill Brook. The present owner of   
the remaining mill, Mrs Miller, says   
that the mill race may still be seen   
with its wheel but it no longer works, 
the last time it did so was 1923 but   
according to Budd Finch, an 86yr old   
inhabitant of the area, the mill       
was then used for corn grinding for    
local farmers but not for bread making.
One of the mills, that downstream,     
seems to have produced paper at one    
stage in its history. There is a claim 
that it was at South Moreton Paper     
Mill in the nineteenth century that    
blotting paper was first discovered.   
There also seems to be some idea that  
one of the mills may have been used as 
an isolation Hospital either during an 
outbreak of Plague in 1603 or perhaps  
during the Napoleonic Wars.
