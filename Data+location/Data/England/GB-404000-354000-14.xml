     The Onecote Wakes has only been   
running for about 5 years - the idea   
was recently revived.  It is held on a 
Saturday towards the end of August.    
     A band leads a procession from the
Jervis Arms car park to the school     
yard.  Behind the band come the        
Oddfellows, then a dancing troupe and  
finally the fancy dress competitors.   
Once at the school the fancy dress     
competition is judged by the opener    
who is usually a local well-known      
person.                                
      Around the outside of the school 
yard there are fund raising stalls and 
side-shows.                            
      Some of the money raised goes to 
different charities and some is kept   
in the Onecote Wakes Fund until it is  
needed for the next wakes.
