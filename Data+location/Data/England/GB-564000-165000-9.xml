		<title>09HOUSING IN MEOPHAM</title>
		<content> Most of the houses lie in the west of 
 the block,along and to both sides of  
 the main road. This area is called    
 Meopham. There is a mixture of old    
 houses, many built about lOO years    
 ago, and new houses built in          
 cul_de_sacs and estates.              
 The older terraced houses are near the
 station, but there are other terraces 
 of between ten and twelve cottages,   
 which we think were occupied by farm  
 workers. They are now owner_occupied. 
 Some of the old larger houses are     
 occupied by many families.            
 Throughout the block there are many   
 scattered houses along the road sides,
 some are large detatched dwellings    
 with big gardens, but some are small  
 bungalows.
