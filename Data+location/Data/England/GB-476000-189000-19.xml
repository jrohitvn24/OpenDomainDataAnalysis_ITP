		<content>  On arriving home from school we have 
a drink and perhaps a snack. We attend 
to our pets and change. Many of us     
practice our Music before sitting down 
with our parents for a meal between    
1800 and 1900.                         
  For our meal we have a traditional   
dinner with meat and vegetables or     
salad, and a dessert.                  
  During the evening we watch about    
four hours of television except when we
go out to take part in an activity away
from home. Girls go to Brownie or Guide
meetings in the Village Hall or we may 
be taken to a neighbouring town for    
dancing, ballet, or music instrumental 
lessons. The boys have to go to nearby 
villages for Scouts or Cubs. We go     
swimming at the Sports Centre in       
Wycombe.                               
  We spend time reading before having a
drink and going to bed about 2130.     </content>
