		<title>06SHOPPING IN LOCAL VILLAGES</title>
		<content>  Stibbington, Waternewton and Sutton  
 contain no shops so all the residents 
 of these villages must travel out of  
 the village to do their shopping.     
 Most people do their main shopping    
 once a week, the majority travelling  
 to nearby Orton Centre where the      
 Rainbow supermarket is located.  The  
 small shops at Wansford village on the
 west side of the A1 are also used     
 quite often.                          
  In Ailsworth there are several       
 village shops and even the garage     
 sells foodstuffs.  Most people use the
 village shops three times a           
 week,though some go there every day.  
 Most people also do their main        
 shopping once a week at Bretton Centre
 on the edge of Peterborough where     
 there is a Sainsburys supermarket.    
  Peterborough centre with its Queens- 
 gate shopping centre is also used.    </content>
