		<title>17Landscape around Brafferton</title>
		<content>    The area is a predominantly rural  
 one with a long history of established
 farming. Accordingly the main features
 visible to the visitor are the fields 
 averaging between 15 and 30 acres in  
 size and divided from each other by   
 quickthorn hedges or fencing.         
    The area is generally low lying and
 gently undulating with small hills,   
 usually capped by a farm, dominating  
 the landscape.                        
    In spite of the farming activity,  
 the land has a surprising amount of   
 tree cover still in place particularly
 along the numerous streams that       
 criss-cross the area.                 
    The predominant colour in the      
 landscape is green, of the trees,     
 grass or the fodder crops grown for   
 the dairy and beef cattle raised here.
 There is some yellow from the oil seed
 rape but only on a small scale.       </content>
