		<title>19A Final Look</title>
		<content> Through the work we have done in the  
{Domesday Survey}we have learnt a lot  
 about our{local area.}We have found   
 that it is mainly a{farming area}and  
 we now realise how hard{farmers}work. 
 We have also seen how important       
{Wentworth Woodhouse}has been to the   
 area. Parts of the area are now       
 changing as lots of{new houses}are    
 built but we think that it will still 
 be mainly a{farming area}for a long   
 time.{Wentworth}village is very       
 unusual because it is an{estate       
{village and}no new building has been  
 allowed. It is a very pretty village  
 and lots of visitors come to see it.  
 We think{tourism}could become         
 important in the area. In{1986 the    
{Polytechnic}will{stop}using{Wentworth 
{House}and no one is sure what will    
 happen to it. We hope it will{open}to}
 the{public.                           </content>
