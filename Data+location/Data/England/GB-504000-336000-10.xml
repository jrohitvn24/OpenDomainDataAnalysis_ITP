		<title>10NEWTON-BORN MRS.X.</title>
		<content> Once a farm servant,Mrs.X lives with  
 her ex-farmworker husband in a rent-  
 free estate cottage.Until 2 years ago 
 it had no hot water,indoor lavatory or
 bathroom.DIY and a 90% Home Improve-  
 ments grant changed her home.Most of  
 her friends have left Newton and she  
 is glad of an extra weekly bus,which  
 is subsidised by the County Council.  
 This allows her to meet her friends   
 and shop twice weekly in Sleaford.She 
 and her husband both require hospital 
 treatment 30miles away and they are   
 collected and taken by ambulance every
 week.She loves to hear all the local  
 gossip and encourages people to pop in
 and chat to her.She is an avid TV     
 watcher but only reads the daily news-
 paper.She rarely goes to church or the
 Village Meeting.
