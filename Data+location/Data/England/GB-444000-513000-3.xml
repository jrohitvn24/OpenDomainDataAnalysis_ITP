		<title>03BADER PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Bader Primary School is built on the  
 old runway of the previous Thornaby   
 airfield,a Battle of Britain station. 
 It serves a catchment area of private 
 and council homes within the new part 
 of Thornaby.Our school and its close  
 environs have strong connections with 
 the 2nd world war.Our school and its  
 name,Bader,honours a famous fighter   
 pilot;our nearest neighbour,Tedder    
 School, honours another distinguished 
 war leader.Even the near wharehousing 
 has adapted redundant hangers.Our     
 school is now a primary establishment 
 with a nursery unit.Until 2 years ago 
 the base supported 2 separate schools,
 an infant and junior but the economic 
 climate dictated that they amalgamate.
 Our school,at present,has a workforce 
 of 52 people serving 480 children.The 
 building is an open_plan purpose built
 structure with a separate admin block.</content>
