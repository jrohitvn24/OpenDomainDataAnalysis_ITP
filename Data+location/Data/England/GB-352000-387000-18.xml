		<content> Although the colliery does not lie    
 within the limits of our allocated    
 block, it was included in our survey  
 because it has a significant effect   
 upon it. Drifts run as far as Widnes, 
 to the south of our block and people  
 travel both from and through our block
 to work there. (Brevity dictates note 
 form.)                                
 800 employees.Youngest 16. Average    
 wage Â£150. Pit opened 1906. Depth     
 800m. Maximum drift length 5km. 24    
 hour operation. Shifts; 7am-3pm,      
 3pm-11pm, 11pm-6am approximately. Most
