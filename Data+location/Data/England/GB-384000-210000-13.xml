		<title>13A DOCTOR'S DAY: Dr Hoyland</title>
		<content>   I get up at 7 o'clock, when the     
 alarm rings and then make the early   
 morning tea. I read for about 45      
 minutes, then open up the greenhouse  
 in the garden then have breakfast. I  
 set off for the surgery and, at about 
 8.15 I look at my post and papers. I  
 see patients until 11am,on average    
 about 20 to 25 a day. Next I sign     
 letters and write prescriptions. I    
 visit people who are too ill to come  
 to the surgery, returning for lunch at
 1pm.                                  
   I go to the hospital in the         
 afternoon and do an operating list at 
 2pm, followed by a ward round. Tea is 
 at home or at the surgery, followed by
 Evening Surgery at 5pm.I go home and  
 watch the news, have an early supper, 
 then this evening I sing for 2 hours  
 in Gloucester Cathedral. When I return
 home I play the piano.                </content>
