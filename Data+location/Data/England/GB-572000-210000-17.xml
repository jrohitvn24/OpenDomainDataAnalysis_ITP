 about the countyside. There are a     
 number of quite attractive farm       
 houses, several houses were once 2 or 
 more farm workers cottages and have   
 been modernised.There are a few medium
 sized houses in isolated positions and
 a cluster of smaller dwellings in     
 Domsey Lane.To the South of the A.12  
 there is part of a residential area   
 most of these houses having been built
 since 1950.There are some older       
 buildings along the Roman Road, and a 
 small development built in 1984.      
 MOUNT MASKALL, Home of the Vice       
 Lieutenent of Essex,is a grade 11     
 listed building situated to the North
