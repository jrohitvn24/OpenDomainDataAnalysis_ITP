		<content> Ludgeshall.  The historic centre of   
 the village, a conservation area,     
 contains a number of old cottages, a  
 fine church (St James), and on its    
 northern limit the ruins of the once  
 area, including a new superarket!  the
 village has gown out from this centre 
 along the Andover road, eventually    
 creeping out to Faberstown, its       
 eastern limit.  Most new development, 
 has been to the north of the Andover  
 road towards Crawlboys Lane, a more   
 recently on land adjoining the old    
 railway line to the south of the      
 existing settlement.  There are       
 various community facilities,a  health
 centre, sports centre, and one Junior 
 and one Secondary school.
