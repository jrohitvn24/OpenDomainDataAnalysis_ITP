		<content>   Life is very comfortable for those  
 living in this area.The houses have   
 ample living space,well furnished,with
 modern appliances eg.television,radio,
 central heating,cookers,food_mixers,  
 telephones,record_players,stereo and  
 video units.                          
   Most families own one car,many have 
 more than one,regarding this as essen_
 tial.Food shopping trips by car to New
 ton Abbot supermarkets,or Moretonhamp_
 stead,are kept to a minimum,as many   
 families own deep freezers.Clothes fur
 niture etc are bought in Exeter.      
   Some families consist of a retired  
 couple who grow their own fruit and   
 vegetables.One family (husband,wife   
 and two children) lives abroad during 
 the winter,and has bought their cott_ 
 age as a retirement home.             
   Cooking is by electricity or 'Aga'.
