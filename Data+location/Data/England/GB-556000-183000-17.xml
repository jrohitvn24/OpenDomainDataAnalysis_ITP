		<title>17CRANHAM CHURCH: UPMINSTER</title>
		<content>   All Saints is the{parish church of  
{Cranham}&amp; like St. Mary's Magdalene at
 North Ockendon is the religious centre
 of what was a{parish of scattered farm
{steads.}No community nucleated around 
 the church except a farm &amp; Hall. All  
 Saints' parish has{grown from 201     
{souls in 1801 to 6000.}The present    
{stone church dates from 1873}replacing
 the former wooden church: priests have
 served here since{1310.               
   The church houses the grave of{Gen. 
{James Oglethorpe who founded the State
{of Georgia USA}in 1733 &amp; died in 1785.
 His family lived in Cranham Hall next 
 to the church where he would entertain
 the famous &amp; noble like{Dr. Johnson.  
 The Hall still exists but like other  
 large houses in the area has been     
 rebuilt (1930s). Descendants still    
 live locally but no longer at Cranham 
 Hall.                                 </content>
