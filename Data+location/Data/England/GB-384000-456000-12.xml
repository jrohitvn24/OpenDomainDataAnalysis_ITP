		<title>12Hellifield Gala</title>
		<content>    The Gala is held every year on the 
 first Saturday in August.  During the 
 year the Gala Committee consisting of 
 about 12 members hold meetings to plan
 and organise Gala Day.                
    The Gala Queen is chosen in May at 
 a disco and the attendants are picked 
 from Primary School children. On Gala 
 Day the procession of Band, floats and
 fancy dress entrants sets off from one
 end of the village and goes to the    
 Gala Field at the other end.  On the  
 field the Fancy Dress prizes are given
 out and during the afternoon there are
 side stall attractions and various    
 refreshments available.               
    The childrens sports are followed  
 by a fell race and the day is finished
 off with a family disco.  Donations   
 are made to village causes and the    
 Committee arrange a Christmas Party   
 for smaller children.                 </content>
