		<content>  The population of the village is just
 under 900,at an average of 3 to each  
 dwelling.                             
  In a survey of 17 households we      
 counted a total of 39 adults (over 18 
 years); 1 (16-18yrs); 10 (11-16yrs);  
 11 (5-10yrs); and 2 (0-4yrs).         
  In our sample,none of the            
 householders had been born in the main
 village (Little Weighton) and none had
 any grown-up children living elsewhere
 in the village. None had parents      
 living in the village either.         
  Most children under 11yrs go to the  
 village primary school, and at 11yrs  
 old,most transfer to Cottingham High  
 School (5km).                         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
