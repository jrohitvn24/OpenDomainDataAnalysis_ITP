 about 340 children who range from 9 to
 13 years.There are 18 staff including 
 the headteacher and 14 rooms.         
  The school opened in 1938 and now    
 it's 47 years old.The heads name is Mr
 Lindley and he's been working in that 
 school for 18 years.                  
    All the schools where the children 
 come from are at Ryhill, Sth.Hiendley 
 and Havercroft,which are all about 1  
 mile away from the school. Most of the
 children live 1 to 2 miles away from  
 the school.                           
   The school goes to Royston baths    
 every Monday morning. The school has  
 got a playground and a massive field  
 which has rabbits in.In the middle of 
 the school there is a bird garden.
