 Like many small villages, both        
{Rowhedge}and{Fingrignhoe}have fewer   
 local shops than in the past as most  
 people prefer to shop at the super &amp;  
 hypermarkets in Colchester.  Rowhedge 
 has one butcher, Mr. Evans who has    
 been serving Rowhedge since l937,one  
 greengrocer's London Stores, a branch 
 of the Co-op., while at the Post      
 Office stationery, greetings cards,   
 confectionary, newspapers and         
 periodicals and a limited number of   
 groceries can be bought.              
    {Fingringhoe}is served by a village
 shop which also includes a sub-Post   
 Office.                               
      At{Abberton}there is a bakery and
 a small shop which also includes a    
 sub-Post Office.
