 People in{Norman}times did not have   
 cars and buses as we do today. They   
 only had horses and carts or their    
 feet for transport. I think they were 
 lucky because they did not have any   
 trouble with the traffic but we are   
 lucky because we can get around faster
 then they could.                      
      They did not need to spend money 
 on petrol and oil as we do today in   
 the 1980's. However they had to buy   
 horses to pull their carts from place 
 to place. People still ride horses    
 today but today it is mostly for      
 pleasure.
