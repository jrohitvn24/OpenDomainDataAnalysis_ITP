		<title>11Gadsbridge Farm.</title>
		<content> This is an{arable farm}of 320 acres   
 which is situated on the Forest Green 
 Road. The present farmer has been     
 farming this land for 18 years.{Wheat 
 and{barley}are the main crops grown   
 and some grass is also grown for{hay.}
 There are about 14 fields and most of 
 them have special names, the oldest   
 is called Spratts Hill. Many{machines 
{and implements}are used on the farm.  
 The plough is a 4 furrow plough which 
 does 10 acres a day and the furrows   
 are 12" wide and 9" deep.Once the land
 has been ploughed a disc harrow breaks
 the soil down more and then the rotar 
 spike is used to make it even finer.  
 Then the subtiller turns the soil over
 so it is ready for seeding. The seeds 
 are sown by a cultivator drill and the
 crops are harvested by a combine      
 harvester. There was also a fertilizer
 spinner,a sprayer,a mower and a baler.</content>
