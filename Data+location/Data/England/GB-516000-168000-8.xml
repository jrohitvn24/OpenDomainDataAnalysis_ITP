		<content> We interviewed Mrs Daisy Cooper who is
 a hundred years old. Daisy has lived  
 in{Kingston}for ninety six years and  
 went to the Saint Luke's School when  
 it was first opened.  When she a      
 little girl there was no Latchmere    
 School.  Latchmere Lane was a real    
 country lane.  Near{Ham Common}there  
 was a stile, and Daisy liked going    
 over it and playing near it.Gipsies   
 used to camp by Latchmere Lane. There 
 were market gardens along Richmond    
 Road.She says Kingston has changed so 
 much since she was young that it is   
 quite differrent now.
