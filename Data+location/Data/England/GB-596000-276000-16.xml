		<title>16COUNTRY HSE HOTEL:C WESTON</title>
		<content>Coney Weston Hall stands on an estate  
recorded in the later Domesday Book.The
present house is a fine example of a   
Country House of the Queen Anne period.
There are now 25 acres of grounds,man- 
aged as gardens &amp; parkland.These con-  
tain many fine trees of which the wide 
variety is a particular feature of the 
estate.A matured Serpentine (or        
"crinkle-crankle") wall surrounds the  
kitchen &amp; herb gardens.Mulberries,nec- 
tarines,peaches &amp; grapes are among the 
home-grown produce.The formal gardens  
to the SW contain two small lakes.The  
Hall is now a licensed Country House   
Hotel,offering twentieth-century       
facilities in a period setting. Part   
of a group of companies specialising   
in the manufacture &amp; distribution of   
health foods, the Hotel provides good  
food for all tastes, with vegetarian   
meals a speciality.                    </content>
