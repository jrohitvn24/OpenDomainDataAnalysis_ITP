Throughout the year there are many     
different events in the town.The main  
ones are as follows:                   
 In the spring the Mayor's Reception   
and Beccles Music Festival. This       
involves schools and indivuals in      
making music and lasts for two days.   
In the summer there is the Beccles Art 
 Exhibition and the Regatta and Carniva
with the Carnival Procession as the    
highlight to this.It ends with a huge  
fireworks display on the Quay.Many     
clubs and societies hold annual events 
and these are looked forward to by the 
people of the town.Among the most      
popular of these are the musical events
put on by the Choral Society and the   
Light Opera Group.Life would be boring 
without these events.
