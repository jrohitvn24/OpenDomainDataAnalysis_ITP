		<content>  We also talked to another woman who  
 said that she found it easier to go to
 the shops on foot,and she enjoyed this
 daily walk.She was on her way to the  
 Grocer's in Rowsley.                  
   The other person to whom we talked  
 was walking to Park Stores in Darley  
 Dale and did this to save money as she
 thought it was a waste of petrol going
 such a short distance by car.She also 
 said she did this to keep fit.
