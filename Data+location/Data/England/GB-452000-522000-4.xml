		<content>  The Monsanto plant at Seal Sands     
 makes mainly Acrylonitrate (AN).This  
 is produced by the oxidation of       
 ammonia and propylene.Such products   
 are called {INTERMEDIATE CHEMICAL     
{PRODUCTS.}Their production yields in  
 turn {BY-PRODUCTS.}                   
  The plant came on stream in the mid  
 1970's and by 1979 the plant's        
 capacity was 200,000 tonnes per year. 
  In 1974 a nylon intermediate plant   
 was built to produce 90,000tonnes of  
 Hexamethylenediamine(NMD). It is      
 synthesised from adiponitrite(ADN)    
 which had been produced               
 from acrylonitrate(AN).These{         
{INTERMEDIATES}produced by Monsanto at 
 Seal Sands are used elsewhere( not on 
 Teesside) to manufacture 'man-made'   
 textiles for clothing and home        
 furnishing.
