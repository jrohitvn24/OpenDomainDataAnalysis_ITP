		<content>I went to St. John's Infant School and 
then the Silver Jubilee School. Our    
uniform was a gymslip, white blouse,   
blazer and a gaberdine mac. Teachers   
were much stricter then but that didn't
do us any harm. Many children walked to
school but I cycled.                   
I left school at 14 years of age and   
found it easy to get my first job as a 
sales assistant in a toy shop. I earned
7/6d a week which is 37.5p today.The   
fashion in clothes in the 1940's was   
called the New Look. We had calf length
circular skirts then tight split       
skirts.                                
House styles have changed a lot in the 
last 30 years. I think houses are now  
built too close together and the       
kitchens and gardens are too small.    
Bury was very quiet then. There were no
vandals or graffitti then. There was   
an outdoor swimming pool.              </content>
