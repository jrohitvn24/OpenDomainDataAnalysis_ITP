		<title>04Where We Live-Stamford Br.</title>
		<content> Most of the houses in Stamford Bridge 
 have been built since world war       
 2.Before that there were only a few   
 houses in Main Street and in the      
 surrounding countryside.These were    
 very old,over a hundred               
 years.Especially the farm houses in   
 High and Low Catton.In 1947 more      
 houses were built including the       
 council houses in the Crescent.By the 
 1960s the estate on the road to Low   
 Catton was being built as well as     
 housing on Viking Road.More council   
 houses were built in 1953.Baretts the 
 house_builders started another new    
 estate in the 1970s.By the 1980s they 
 were building the Burtonfields Estate 
 on the road to Bridlinton.Most of the 
 houses in Stamford Bridge are owner   
 occupied but some people prefer to    
 rent from the council.Domestic fuel   
 is electricity and oil,no mains gas.  </content>
