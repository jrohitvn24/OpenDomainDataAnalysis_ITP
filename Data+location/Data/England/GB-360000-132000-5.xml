		<content> Properties in{Castle Cary}tend to be  
 either terraced cottages (or houses)  
 or detached houses. They are built    
 mostly of local ham stone, with       
 recently built properties, e.g. those 
 on the Church Field development at    
{Ansford,}being built of a             
 re-constituted stone designed to      
 resemble the local stone. There are   
 fewer brick houses, and these are     
 usually terraced.                     
  Property in the surrounding villages 
 are again built chiefly from stone and
 are again mainly terraced or detatched
 cottages, with a few large detatched  
 stone farmhouses or rectories. Hardly 
 any brick properties are to be found. 
  The most common form of roofing is   
 tile, but there are a few slate and   
 thatched rooves.
