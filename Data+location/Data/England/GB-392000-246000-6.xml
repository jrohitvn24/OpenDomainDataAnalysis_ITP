		<title>06D.B. PLOUGH AND HARROW.</title>
		<content>     The Plough and Harrow Public House
 is owned by{Mrs. Bovey.}The pub has   
 been standing for{400 years,}though   
 when it was built it wasn't intended  
 to be a pub. It was a{coaching house,}
 as there used to be a road on the     
 other side of it. Mrs. Bovey didn't   
 know how the pub got its name, but    
 presumed it was because of a farm     
 nearby. She has owned it for          
 twenty_six years and the previous     
 owner was called Mr. Lilley. She      
 employs sixteen people and serves hot 
 meals. The most popular meal is steak.
     Outside is an{old plough}which is 
 sixty years old. It was there when    
 Mrs. Bovey took over.                 
     While she has owned the pub there 
 has not been any trouble or fighting. 
     In Drakes Broughton there are two 
 pubs. The other is called The Old Oak.
