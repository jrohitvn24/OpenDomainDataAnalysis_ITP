		<content> The area is predominantly used for    
 farming.  The land is gently sloping  
 chald downland with occasional clay   
 caps on hills. A mixed farming system 
 is followed over the whole area and a 
 common rotation would be 1-2 years    
 wheat, 3-4 years barley, 3-4 years    
 grassland. Sheep are grazed           
 intensively to restore fertility to   
 the shallow chalk soils.  Two farms in
 the area have dairying as part of     
 their mixed system.  Woodlands are    
 generally small plantations of firs   
 and beech. There is a large natural   
 deciduous woodland which follows the  
 river.  The river is the Dever a      
 tributary to the river Test, this     
 starts from Chalk Spring and is good  
 for trout fishing.
