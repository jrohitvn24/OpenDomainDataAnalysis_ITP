		<title>10Tavistock Parish Church</title>
		<content>    Our church is called St.Eustachius 
 and is about 600 years old.It was     
 built of Hurdwick stone by the monks  
 of{Tavistock Abbey}and two of the big 
 doors in the tower used to be the     
 cartway into the Abbey. The font is   
 very special because{Francis Drake}was
 christened in it.                     
    Before the days of organs, hymns   
 were played by a band up in a gallery 
 and one of the instruments, called a  
{serpent,}is hanging on the tower wall.
 On the end of one of the pews is a    
 tiny white mouse which is the         
 signature of the craftsman who carved 
 the pews.                             
                                       
    People worship every day in our    
 church and probably have done since   
 the very beginning except during the  
{Civil War}when Cromwell's soldiers    
 lived in it and vandalised it.        </content>
