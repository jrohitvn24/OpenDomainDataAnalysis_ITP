		<content>   As in every community, urban or     
 otherwise, there is a mixture of      
 different religions.  Here the Church 
 of England is the biggest religion,   
 probably because of the CofE school   
 and the local church building.  There 
 are some Roman Catholic families in   
 the area (the nearest Catholic church 
 being about 9 miles away). There are  
 also Methodist families (the nearest  
 Methodist Church about 3 miles away). 
 Some Quaker (Society of Friends)      
 families live in the area (the nearest
 Quaker meeting being 9 miles away, and
 another 12 miles).                    
   In this community we have no non-   
 Christian religions, such as Muslim or
 Jewish, as in some other areas.       
   The local CofE church holds one     
 service every Sunday. Each week of the
 month has a different from - Morning  
 &amp; Evening Prayer and Holy Communion.  </content>
