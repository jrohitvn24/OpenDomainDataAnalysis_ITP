		<content> The sloping ground considered too     
 steep for ploughing is permanent grass
 /downland and is grazed by sheep and  
 beef cattle which are reared          
 commercially and sold for meat for    
 human consumption.  The majority are  
 sold at a local market, alive or dead.
 The steep grass slopes have very      
 little nitrogen added.  The lower     
 parts which are passable with a       
 tractor are given nitrogen in the     
 Spring.  Some of the lower fields, to 
 give a crop rotation, are planted with
 Italian rye grass as a break from     
 cereal crops and are then grazed by   
 sheep, beef cattle, or a dairy herd of
 cows. Silage or hay is also cut from  
 this rye grass to be used as winter   
 feed for the animals. Other break     
 crops include kale (fed fresh) or     
 winter beans, harvested by combine and
 used as high-protein supplement feed. </content>
