		<title>19BEAUTY SPOTS,CATON</title>
		<content>The villages of Caton and Brookhouse   
are set in an area of natural beauty   
and there are many interesting and     
attractive walks and footpaths in the  
area. In recent years a disused railway
line has been converted into a footpath
and cycleway. Following,as it does,the 
course of the River Lune, the path     
affords many scenic views and is very  
popular. The Crook O'Lune attracts many
visitors who come to picnic in this    
picturesque spot where the River Lune  
doubles back on itself.Bathing also is 
popular,though the river currents can  
be dangerous.Littledale Cragg is       
another site familiar to picnickers.   
Although most visitors take the easy   
route to the summit by car, the Cragg  
is used by rock climbers to sharpen    
their skills. Below the Cragg, the     
sparkling waters of Artlebeck flow     
through a delightful wooded valley.    </content>
