		<content>      One of the haulage firms at      
 Barrington is 66 years old and it     
 started at Ashington in 1919.  They   
 have 25 wagons and 6o trailers.  On   
 the wagons it has "Bells of           
 Ashington". About 35 people work for  
 Mr Bell, 2O of the people drive the   
 wagons, 4 people maintain the engines 
 and the bodywork of the wagons.       
      The wagons are bought when they  
 are brand new and sold when they are 5
 or 6 years old.  The trailers are     
 attached to the wagon by a 2" pin,    
 there are also wires attached to make 
 the lights work.  Each trailer has a  
 number so the drivers know which      
 trailer to connect to his wagon.  The 
 goods they carry are taken all over   
 the Country.  There are computers in  
 the office which store information    
 about the wagons.
