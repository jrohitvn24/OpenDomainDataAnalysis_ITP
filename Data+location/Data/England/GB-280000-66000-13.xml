		<content>{ The early parish churches of Torbryan
{and Denbury give this area a link with
{William the Conqueror.                
  The four villages of Broadhempston,  
 Denbury, Ipplepen and Torbryan each   
 has a splendid church built in 14th   
 century  perpendicular style when this
 was a prosperous wool-producing area. 
{ Today these churches are faced with  
{enormous bills for urgent repairs to  
{their fabric.}The tower at Torbryan is
 in need of repair, the bells cannot   
 be rung. South window mullions have   
 recently been repaired.{Â£20,000 is    
{needed for}repairing those at{Ipplepen
 Both churches have well-preserved     
 medieval screen paintings.            
{ Â£30,000 is wanted for repairs to the 
{Methodist Church ,Ipplepen.           
  The communities served by these      
 churches are organising ways to raise 
 the money as quickly as possible.     </content>
