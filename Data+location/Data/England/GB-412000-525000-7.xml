		<content> We toured our area looking at the     
 primary land cover and looking to see 
 to what use the land was put. Through-
 out the area the land cover is one of 
 grazing for animals,mainly cows,but in
 some areas,sheep.That land which is   
 not used as grazing is being used to  
 grow hay for silage.The river Gaunless
 flows through the area &amp; the          
 surounding land slopes very steeply to
 the valley bottom &amp; makes the grazing 
 land very undulating.Where the land is
 steepest and the grazing is roughest  
 we found sheep.We found no fields     
 being used to grow crops in the whole 
 of our area.                          
 Whilst we were surveying the area,we  
 also tried to identify the breed of   
 cattle grazing the land.Most cattle in
 the area were Fresians,but we did find
 a herd of Jersey cows.We decided that 
 the farms are dairy farms.            </content>
