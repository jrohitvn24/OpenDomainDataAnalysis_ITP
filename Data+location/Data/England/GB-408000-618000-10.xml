		<title>10General Accomodation.</title>
		<content>   Apart from farm accommodation       
 previously discussed there are several
 other types of housing, though none of
 it "Council".{Much of Eglingham       
{Village still belongs to the estate   
 although some houses have now been    
{sold to private individuals,}as have  
 plots of land on which new houses have
 been errected, strictly conforming to 
{conservation regulations}(eg. stone   
 structures, small window panes etc.)  
  Three vicarages have been built in   
 over a century. The second, a large   
 Victorian building, has been sold and 
 is now a private home whilst a new,   
 small convenient one has recently been
 built.Indeed it is one of only four   
 houses built in several years, two of 
 which were pre-fabricated stone-faced 
 houses. One more house is currently   
 under construction.Planning permission
 for several others is being sought.   </content>
