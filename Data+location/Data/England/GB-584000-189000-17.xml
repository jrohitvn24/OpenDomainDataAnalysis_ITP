		<title>17Children's Pets.</title>
		<content> We did a test to find the most popular
 pet in the school.There are twelve    
 classes in our school in each class   
 there is a avarage of 31 children.    
 We found out that the most popular    
 pet in the school was fish.83 people  
 in the school own fish.The least      
 popular pet in the school is a rat    
 only one person in the school has a   
 rat.17.1% of the children in the      
 school have not got any pets.The      
 second least popular pet is a gerbil. 
 Only four people in the school own    
 gerbils.The second most populer pet is
 a dog.72 people in the school own     
 dogs.Nearly 1/4 of the children in the
 school own dogs.1/7 of the chidren    
 in the school own a rabbit.Nearly 1/5 
 of the children in the school own     
 a cat.So most of the children keep    
 pets of one sort or another.
