		<content>  The two farms in this area are of    
 grade 3/4 land and grade 2/3 type.    
 The larger farm (270 acres) has a     
 tenant occupier.  However the smaller 
 farm is fully equiped while its       
 counterpart has machinery brought over
 from the home farm in Hayle.          
  Milk is sold the Milk Marketting     
 Board                                 
 from the stock of Fresians and heifers
 on both farms.  There are no more than
 two workers on each farm and the farms
 are subject to quotas.  Farms in this 
 area in the eighties face problems    
 eith EEC quotas and over-production.  
  There is also a farm called Magar    
 farm - which we were unable to visit.
