		<content>  Elton W.I. meets in the Village Hall 
 on the second Thursday of each month. 
 1986 is the thirty-third anniversary. 
 There are thirty-six members with ages
 ranging from 24 to 84 years.          
  Each year the Committee arranges a   
 varied programme and this year there  
 will be speakers on topics as diverse 
 as wine-making, homeopathic medicine, 
 antiques and cactus growing.          
  Elton W.I. has always played a       
 significant part in the life of the   
 village and members run monthly whist-
 drives, organise keep-fit classes and 
 raise money for causes both within and
 without the village. In March 1985    
 eight members formed the Eltonian Club
 for the Senior Citizens, but for many 
 years an annual tea and outing has    
 been arranged for them.               
  Shortly before Christmas members alw-
 ays carol-sing around the village.    </content>
