		<title>01E of Everdon, Nr Daventry</title>
		<content> This part of Northamptonshire is an   
 unspoilt rural area, almost entirely  
 agricultural. The only settlements    
 which lie within the area are the     
 village of Church Stowe, close to the 
 Roman Watling Street, and part of the 
 village of Farthingstone. The         
 residents of both places are mainly   
 either commuters or connected with    
 agriculture. On the brow of a hill to 
 the north of Farthingstone is an      
 earthwork known as Castle Dykes,      
 believed to be part of a medieval     
 castle. Everdon Stubbs is an area of  
 mixed coppice with standards. Carpets 
 of bluebells are a feature in the     
 Spring. Coppiced trees include sweet  
 chestnut, sycamore and hazel and      
 standards are dominated by the oak.   
 There are also some rowan trees and   
 the area has been designated an SSSI  
 because of these &amp; the wild daffodils.</content>
