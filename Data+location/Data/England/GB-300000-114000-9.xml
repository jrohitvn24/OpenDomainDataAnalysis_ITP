		<title>09MIDLAND SCHOOL BANK</title>
		<content> Each Wednesday in the school hall the 
 children operate the school bank which
 started on the 23rd October 1985. On  
 that day 31 new accounts were opened  
 in the name of the Midland Bank. The  
 school is recognised as a bank in the 
 meaning of the Banking Act 1979.Each  
 week the children can deposit or      
 withdraw their money and all          
 transactions are completed by the     
 school bank staff which consists of 1 
 manager, 2 cashiers and 1 ledger      
 clerk, all of which are children.The  
 staff change every 4 weeks which gives
 all the senior children a chance to   
 operate as bank staff.                
 After each opening the money is safely
 taken to the Tiverton Branch where all
 the childrens accounts are held .
