		<content> There are six schools in our          
 block,Ashley Infants (including Plus  
 One Group and Special Unit ), Ashley  
 Junior, Fernhill Manor, Hordle        
 Primary, New Milton Infants and       
 New Milton Junior.                    
 Altogether 1152 children attend these 
 schools. 89 members of staff teach and
 look after them.                      
 All the schools are for boys and girls
 and are day schools except Fernhill   
 Manor which has some girls boarding.  
 The age range of all the children is  
 from 3-11 years inclusive.            
 The Special Unit and the Plus One     
 Group at Ashley teach children with   
 learning difficulties. In the other   
 schools, the number of boys and girls 
 are about equal but in these two      
 groups there are three times as many  
 boys as girls.                        
                                       </content>
