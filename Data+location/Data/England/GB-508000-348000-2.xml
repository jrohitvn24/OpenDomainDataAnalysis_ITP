		<title>02 HAVERHOLME PARK</title>
		<content> Haverholme park is not as the name    
 suggests a play park or an animal     
 park,but is in actual fact a large    
 agricultural land area.The land is    
 used mainly for farming various types 
 of arable crops.Running through  the  
 park is a river called the River SLEA.
 The nearest town to the park is called
 SLEAFORD,it being named after a       
 fording place across the river.Many of
 the local children go to the park to  
 swim in the river during their summer 
 holidays.The park is owned by the Post
 Office Trust Fund.Near the park is an 
 old priory that is suppossedly haunted
 by a nun .
