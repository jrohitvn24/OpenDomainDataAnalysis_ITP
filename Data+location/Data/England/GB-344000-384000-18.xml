		<content>    One of the older residents         
 interviewed was Mrs Copeland. Mrs     
 Copeland is a sidesperson at St       
 Nicholas' Church and a member of the  
 church council. Her husband is a      
 church warden. Mrs Copeland was a     
 housewife in Halewood in 1945. She has
 lived in Halewood all of her life. Her
 husband worked for the railways. They 
 used to live in the railway cottages, 
 now demolished, which were near to    
 where Plantation School now stands. In
 1945 people walked or caught the bus  
 to work. A few people had bicycles and
 very few had a car. Buses were        
 infrequent - if you missed one you had
 to wait two hours for the next.       
    Mrs Copeland said that after the   
 war all of the children had a big     
 party in the fields behind their      
 houses. Halewood was all farmland with
 a few houses here and there.          </content>
