		<title>20BEACHES IN JERSEY</title>
		<content> Wherever you live or stay in Jersey   
 you are never very far from a beach.  
 That is one of the many reasons why   
 people decide to live or come here for
 a holiday.                            
 On a normal hot summer's day in       
 Jersey, the beaches are usually packed
 by people trying to get a tan, who    
 usually end up getting burnt.  This   
 often happens because the air is so   
 clear and unpolluted in Jersey.       
 Many people go swimming or do         
 watersports like windsurfing, water   
 skiing, sailing and canoeing.  Many   
 school children also spend school     
 holidays down on the beach with their 
 friends.  People wander about in      
 brightly coloured bikinis, their      
 bodies shining in sun oil.  Children  
 lick ice-creams and lollies.  Then as 
 the sun goes down the beach is        
 gradually deserted.                   </content>
