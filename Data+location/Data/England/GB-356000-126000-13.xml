		<title>13FARMLAND (GRASSLAND)</title>
		<content>        A large amount of the farmland 
 in this area is grassland. The park at
 Hazlegrove, which is about 200 acres, 
 is used purely as grazing land for    
 beef cattle. In the autumn pigs are   
 also let lose to feed on the acorns   
 from the oak trees.                   
        Also in this area there are    
 large amounts of grazing land for     
 dairy cattle. However the grass used  
 for dairy cattle is much richer than  
 the harsher grass used for beef       
 cattle.                               
        There is also grassland used   
 for sheep grazing but huge fields are 
 not used. Orchards, as the trees have 
 either fallen down or died, have been 
 used for sheep grazing on a small     
 scale.                                
        Many people ride horses in our 
 area and about five acres is dedicated
 for horse grazing.                    </content>
