 Our area lies within the old East     
 Riding but as a result of the         
 Redcliffe=Maud report it was          
 designated to join Humberside, a new  
 administrative area founded around the
 river Humber.                         
 Beneath this top layer of local       
 government there is another band of   
 local government - the District       
 Council.  Preston is governed from    
 Skirlaugh.Interest in local government
 is at a fairly apathetic level and    
 complaints that decisions are made    
 with no reference to local opinion are
 not fair but probably reflect a much  
 deeper disenchantment with government 
 as a whole.                           
 Ironically the Preston Parish Council 
 is well thought of and has made quite 
 an impact on the locality.            </content>
