		<title>10SCHOOLS IN THE DISTRICT.</title>
		<content> There are three primary schools in the
 area. They are for children up to the 
 age of 11 from Grassmoor, Heath and   
 Temple Normanton. All the schools are 
 over a hundred years old.             
 Nursery classes have just been opened 
 at Heath and Grassmoor. Children can  
 start in the nursery after they are 3 
 years old.                            
 At the moment Grassmoor School is     
 getting bigger while fewer children   
 are starting at the other schools     
 because of 'falling rolls'.           
 At Grassmoor there are usually about  
 30 children in each class grouped by  
 age.                                  
 When the children leave the primary   
 schools they mainly go to Deincourt or
 Heath Schools which are for children  
 over ll years of age. Some children go
 to the secondary schools at Hasland,  
 or Tupton or Tibshelf.                </content>
