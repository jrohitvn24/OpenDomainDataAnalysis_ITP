		<content>{Thornton Watlass Gardening Club}has   
 been running for about eight years.   
 About 65_70 people have joined it.It  
 meets once a month in winter and twice
 a month in summer.                    
                                       
 The aims of the club are to encourage 
 people to show their produce, to keep 
 gardens neat and to give the members  
 an interest.                          
                                       
 The gardening club doesn't involve    
 children although they sometimes come 
 to see what is happening.             
                                       
 In September there are things that do 
 involve children in the show. They    
 compete for small cash prizes by      
 creating animals made from vegetables 
 and by making miniature gardens. Every
 child who enters is given ten pence   
 and the winners receive fifty pence.  </content>
