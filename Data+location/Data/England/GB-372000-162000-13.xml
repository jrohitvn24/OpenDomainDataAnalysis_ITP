 The work we do at school is           
 history,science,English,maths,art     
 and lots of other things.We do lots of
 sports and games that often take place
 on our playing field next to the      
 school.We go on trips, school         
 journeys,and we go to museums.        
   Apart from being in the classroom   
 and going on trips we have an assembly
 every morning at 10.15 a.m. until play
 time at 10.40 a.m. At 11.a.m we come  
 in and work for an hour and then go to
 the dining  room for lunch.The dinner 
 hour is long enough for us to eat our 
 lunch and have a game of football     
 before school re-starts.The bell is   
 rung for the end of lunch hour and we 
 all go back to the classroom and      
 normally do some art and craft,and    
 topic work.
