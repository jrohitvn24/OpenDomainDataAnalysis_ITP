		<title>02LAND USE IN FARNLEY.</title>
		<content> This area is on the Western edge      
 of the Yorkshire Coalfield, where it  
 merges into the Pennine foothills. The
 area is drained by the Farnley and    
 Pudsey becks which are tributaries of 
 the River Aire. Being close to the    
 Coal-field, there is much evidence of 
 19th century mining. Good quality     
 ironstone has been found in the area  
 and New Farnley owes its existence to 
 the mineral resources found here. The 
 area is now predominantly residential 
 and light industrial, though there is 
 a number of farms in the south and    
 west. Stock raising is the norm but   
 there is some arable and a little     
 market gardening. There is little     
 woodland, such as there is being      
 mostly in the public parks at Armley, 
 Wortley and Farnley.
