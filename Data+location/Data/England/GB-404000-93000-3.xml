		<title>03KNIGHTON HEATH GOLF CLUB</title>
		<content> The Knighton Heath Golf Course is a   
 large course of 180 acres and there   
 are 684 members. The junior groups are
 twelve and over, and the senior group 
 members twenty three and over. Each   
 member has a share in the Club and    
 when they leave they get this money   
 back. They do not have to pay any     
 additional fees for playing. If they  
 wish they can hire equipment          
 but very rarely do because they       
 usually have their own. In 1984 the   
 income of the Club was Â£120000 and    
 they spent Â£110000. If a mew member   
 wants to join they have to wait two   
 months. There are 11 people in charge 
 including the Head Green Keeper who   
 has 3 full-time and 1 part-time people
 under his command. They cut the greens
 every other day. The Club opens at    
 7.30am and closes at 10.00pm.
