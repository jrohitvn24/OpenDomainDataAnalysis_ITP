		<title>02BRIEF HISTORY OF B/WALTHAM</title>
		<content>   Bishops Waltham has existed as a    
 settlement since the{Stone Age.}There 
 are buildings dating back to the      
 1400s,some originally constructed as  
 open halls.                           
   It was a thriving market town with  
 public houses and stalls. Most of the 
 shops were built in 1400s.            
   Early{industries}include rope and   
 brick making alongside wool.          
   The town has always depended on its 
{agriculture,}though the decline left  
 it in a poor state. Bishops Waltham is
 now growing rapidly in size and in    
 prosperity.                           
   The palace, a health refuge for the 
{Bishops of Winchester}is now in ruins.
 It was used as an entertainer's       
 grounds from the time of{William the  
{Conqueror}and hunting went on in the  
 woods around.                         
   Waltham means 'a home in the woods'.</content>
