		<title>11SHERATON GRANGE SCHOOL.</title>
		<content> The Grange and Sheraton schools were  
 both separate until we were told that 
 Sheraton School was amalgamating with 
 ours. The amalgamation only           
 interfered with the first years but it
 still caused a lot of problems because
 Sheraton pupils have now either gone  
 to a different school or they have to 
 walk from Hardwick or Roseworth to The
 Grange which is now called Sheraton   
 Grange. There are also difficulties   
 for the teachers because they have to 
 travel from site to site during breaks
 and dinnertimes to teach different    
 classes. Also the head of fifth year  
 at Sheraton Grange is also the head of
 Sheraton which is very awkward. There 
 have also been a lot of changes at the
 old Grange School as a lot of teachers
 left due to the amalgamation, so we   
 have new teachers most of them from   
 the old Sheraton School.              </content>
