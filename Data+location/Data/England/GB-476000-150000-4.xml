		<title>04CROOKHAM : EMPLOYMENT</title>
		<content> Crookham Village is within the        
 commuter belt and this is a feature of
 employment. However, there is         
 employment on a part-time basis in the
 village shop and newsagents. The      
 garage employs three people full-time 
 on car sales and body repairs and one 
 person part-time for office work. The 
 hop-drying houses have been converted 
 into four units for light industry    
 giving eight people employment. There 
 is a small electrical contractor      
 providing 2 full-time jobs. The farm, 
 smallholding and nursery employ       
 fifteen people on horticultural work. 
 The Post Office has a full-time       
 manager and has been established since
 1836, although on its present site    
 from 1905.
