 A medieval moated manor house once    
 owned by the Broome family.They later 
 became Ferrers with the marriage of   
 Constance Broome to Edward Ferrers.   
                                       
 The house was given to the National   
 Trust and opened to the public in     
 1983.                                 
                                       
 It has 40 thousand visitors a year but
 only 50 can go in at a time, because  
 the floors are not very safe.         
                                       
 There is a blood stain on the library 
 floor from a priest killed by Nickolas
 in 1480.He was caught chatting up his 
 wife.                                 
                                       
 The garden is best in Spring,When the 
 bulbs are in bloom.
