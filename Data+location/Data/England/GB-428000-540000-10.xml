		<title>10MY STREET</title>
		<content>   My street is called Apperley Avenue.
 It is situated in an estate of private
 houses in High Shincliffe.            
   All of the houses are 9 years old,  
 and there are 19 houses arranged in a 
 cul de sac.                           
   The road has a tarmacadam surface   
 and there are 6 street drains which   
 carry away surface water. There are   
 also 5 electric lamposts which light  
 up the street at night.               
   Motor cars are allowed to park in   
 the street, but each home has space   
 for parking a car,as well as a garage.
   The street is purely residential, as
 there are no shops, businesses, or    
 factories.
