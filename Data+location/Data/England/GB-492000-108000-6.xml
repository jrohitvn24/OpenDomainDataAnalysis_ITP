		<content> Originally,most of the land in the    
 Slindon sector of our area belonged to
 a Colonel Leslie, but for the past 33 
 years The National Trust have owned   
 it.They lease most of the land out to 
 tenant farmers who use it for growing 
 crops and supporting livestock, or    
 they use it themselves for tree       
 plantations and for conservation. Some
 of the trees which they plant are     
 Beech and Corsican Pine. The Corsican 
 Pine is sometimes planted and then    
 moved,as happened with some which they
 planted in 1952 then moved in 1956 and
 replanted at Courthill Pond.          
 The National Trust also ensure that   
 their tenants care for the trees and  
 wildlife on their land, and that the  
 wildlife in those areas is protected.
