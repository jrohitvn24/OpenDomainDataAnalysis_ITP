 playschool. The children there are    
 between 2\ years and 5 years.The      
 supervisor is Mrs. Clarke and the     
 helpers are Mrs. Godfrey, Mrs. Daw and
 Mrs. Pearce.The group which is run for
 Nanstallon toddlers as well has 12    
 boys and 8 girls.It owns a small      
 roundabout, a slide, a trampolene and 
 a first aid kit.Sometimes the children
 sit at tables and make things with    
 dough or junk or they do jigsaws.They 
 play with toys, look at books and have
 biscuits and milk.They meet twice a   
 week, starting at 9-00am and finishing
 at noon.                              
 When it is someone's birthday they    
 have a small party. There is a band   
 which gets very noisy!
