		<title>20 - CHANGE OF BUILDING USE</title>
		<content>  Coates castle was built in 1820 by   
 Lord Egremont. The Duchess of Abercorn
 lived there for 20 years until her    
 death in 1905. During the second war  
 war a secret research unit occupied   
 it while developing the Becklar       
 bombardment. The castle has since been
 altered to form eight flats.          
  Burton Park House was built in       
 1825 by Henry Bassett. The main       
 staircase was brought from            
 Michael Grove, Arundel in 1829.       
 For many years the Courtauld          
 family lived there, including         
 Major J.S.Courtauld who was MP        
 for Chichester. In 1946 St.Michael's  
 School moved there from Bognor Regis, 
 and it has remained as a private girls
 school since that time.
