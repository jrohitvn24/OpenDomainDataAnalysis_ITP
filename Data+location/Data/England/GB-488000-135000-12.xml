		<content>   AS PART OF OUR DOMESDAY PROJECT WE  
 SENT OUT QUESTIONNAIRES TO ALL THE    
 PEOPLE LIVING IN OUR AREA. WE WANTED  
 TO FIND OUT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE ABOUT 
 THEIR HOME LIFE AND LIFE STYLES IN    
 HINDHEAD IN I985                      
  WE DISCOVERED THAT THE MAJORITY OF   
 PEOPLE LIVE IN POST-WAR, DETACHED     
 HOUSING, BUILT OF BRICK, WITH GARDENS 
 OF AT LEAST A QUARTER OF AN ACRE.     
 THESE HOUSES WERE MOSTLY BETWEEN 5-IO 
 YEARS OLD AND WERE OWNER-OCCUPIED     
 FAMILY HOMES.                         
  THERE WERE ALSO A HIGH PROPORTION OF 
 BUNGALOWS AND MANY OF THE LARGE       
 VICTORIAN HOUSES HAD BEEN CONVERTED   
 INTO FLATS. IT BECAME CLEAR TO US THAT
 THIS AREA ATTRACTS MANY WEALTHY,      
 RETIRED PEOPLE AND SUCCESSFUL         
 PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE AND THEIR FAMILIES
 WHO WISH TO LIVE IN THE COUNTRY WHILST
 BEING WITHIN EASY REACH OF LONDON.    </content>
