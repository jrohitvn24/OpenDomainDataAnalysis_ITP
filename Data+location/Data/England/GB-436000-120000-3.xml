		<content> Friday 21st. June 1985. I woke up to  
 an almost empty house; the day had at 
 last come. We were going to move to   
 Fairview Drive Romsey. My sister went 
 off to school. As usual something went
 wrong _ it was raining. But it was    
 better than last time because the last
 time it was snowing. Then there was a 
 knock at the door. It was the people  
 to help. They had a cup of coffee and 
 then started to move the mattresses   
 out to the van. Then I took the       
 headboards out to the van. After a    
 little while they took a van load down
 came back and had a cup of coffee. Mum
 ran out of milk so I went down to the 
 shop and got some.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
