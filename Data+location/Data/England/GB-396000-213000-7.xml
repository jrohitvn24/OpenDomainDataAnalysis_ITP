		<title>07Arable farming</title>
		<content> We interviewed a farmer in our area   
 whose farm is like most others.He has 
 got horses but no other animals at the
 moment.Crops are more important than  
 animals.He grows oil seed rape, wheat 
 barley,peas and rye.He has just       
 started to grow peas.This new crop    
 makes the soil fertile.He harvests    
 in August.He has 560 acres of land.He 
 has only two people working on the    
 farm and two more local people at     
 harvest time but long ago there were  
 lots from the village.He grows oil    
 seed rape in one field then winter    
 wheat for 2 years, peas, winter wheat 
 again and barley for 2 years in       
 rotation.Farm life on his farm has    
 changed a lot.His farm used to be a   
 dairy farm and there were lots of     
 others in the area.The last dairy farm
 was sold in 1984.So there have been   
 great changes from dairy to arable.   </content>
