		<title>07Education of a Deaf Child</title>
		<content>The parents of Mark thought that the   
general standard of education for deaf 
children is very low.  Schools still   
seem to be experimenting to find a     
generally successful method.  Sign     
language has been out of fashion during
the past few years, but now the school 
are trying a mixture of "sign" language
and "vocal".  Mark has achieved much   
more with this method than with the    
purely "vocal" method.                 
  The academic work covered is the same
as a normal school and many children go
on to take national exams.             
  Mark has a wide vocabulary and will  
sit and read a newspaper.              
  Socially he won't "talk" to people.  
  The school insist that children go   
out shopping, Mark doesn't enjoy this. 
  He is insecure about trying new      
things and he depends very much on     
adults.                                </content>
