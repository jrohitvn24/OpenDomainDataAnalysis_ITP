		<title>10 I.Y.Y. SHUGBOROUGH. 1985</title>
		<content>  I went to Shugborough Hall for the   
International Youth Year (IYY) festival
being held there.There were groups of  
scouts,army cadets,youth clubs and Boys
Brigade all putting on seperate        
displays.                              
  This was a two day event.On the first
day Princess Anne visited the show and 
the second day was open to the public. 
  The army cadets had an air rifle     
range,a false minefield and some canoes
on display.Out of these I went on the  
air rifles and in a canoe.The youth    
clubs had dancers and a tuck shop.     
  The Boys Brigade had basket making,  
canoe mending,map reading and two      
computers(I was sanding a canoe).      
  The scouts had set up a scaffolding  
and were abseiling.They were also      
painting pottery.                      
  Lord Lichfield was there,walking     
around and visiting the marquees.      </content>
