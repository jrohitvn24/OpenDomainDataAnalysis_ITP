		<title>02BROWN AND HUNT COMPANY</title>
		<content> This farm keeps pigs and also makes   
 fencing.Mr Brown owns the farm and he 
 takes care of all the pigs.Mr Hunt    
 makes all the fencing on the farm.The 
 fencing is made with long strips of   
 wood.First of all Mr Hunt put 5 strips
 of wood on a bench with 4 planks round
 the outside.He got a big hammer/drill 
 which nailed all the wood together.The
 drill made a clanking noise.The wood  
 came from Portugal.It was chestnut    
 wood and when it was finished it was  
 dipped into a 7foot tank of varnish.  
 This gave it a deep brown appearance.
