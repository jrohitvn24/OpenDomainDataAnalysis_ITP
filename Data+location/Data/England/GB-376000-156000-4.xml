		<content>  THE LARGEST, AND MOST IMPORTANT      
 BUILDING IN THE VILLAGE, IS{HINTON    
{HOUSE.}IT USED TO BE THE GRANGE OF    
 HINTON PRIORY, BUT IT HAS NOW BEEN    
 DIVIDED INTO THREE FLATS AND A MAIN   
 LIVING AREA. THERE ARE SIX PERMANENT  
 RESIDENTS IN THE HOUSE, AND SOME      
 TEMPORARY ONES. ON THE SIDE OF THE    
 HOUSE IS AN ORANGERY, WHICH NOW       
 CONTAINS PLANTS SUCH AS GERANIUMS.    
  THE OWNERS TEND TO MOST OF THE       
 GARDENS, WHICH TAKE UP NINE ACRES,    
 ALTHOUGH ONE OF THE VILLAGE BOYS      
 LOOKS AFTER THE LAWNS. THE GARDENS ARE
 NOT OPEN TO THE PUBLIC. THE OWNERS    
 ALSO LOOK AFTER THE BUSINESS SIDE OF  
 THE FARMS.                            
  THERE IS PLENTY OF THE USUAL WILDLIFE
 e.g.SQUIRRELS, RABBITS AND A LOT OF   
 ROOKS, AROUND THE GROUNDS. IT IS NOT  
 UNCOMMON TO FIND A BEES' NEST         
 SOMEWHERE IN THE HOUSE.               </content>
