 capital of{West Yorkshire.}It has many
 fine buildings dominated by the       
{Cathedral Church of All Saints,}the   
 spire of which is the highest in      
 Yorkshire at a height of 75 metres.   
 Wakefield was granted its city charter
 in 1888 but it had been an important  
 market town for many centuries before 
 that.{The County Hall, Law Courts,    
{Town Hall and Museum}are all close to 
 one another on Wood Street. There is  
 also a{Chantry Chapel}on Kirkgate     
 Bridge as it crosses the{River Calder 
 on the main southerly exit from the   
 city. There are several hospitals, the
 most famous of which is probably      
 Pinderfields the home of the Regional 
 Burns Unit and School of Remedial     
 Gymnasts. It has open and indoor      
 markets and the main shopping area has
 recently been pedestrianised.         </content>
