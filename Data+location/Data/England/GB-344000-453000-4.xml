and father and three boys who are 15,12
and 7 years old. Daddy works all day as
a joiner.He takes a packed lunch. Me   
and my brothers go to school and we    
also take a packed lunch. Mother works 
every day in a shop.She will be home   
when I get in from school.We all have  
tea together at the table.My big       
brothers have homework to do at night. 
But two nights a week they go to a     
sports club in Lancaster for boxing and
karate.My mother,dad and me all use    
weights and an exercise bike in our    
garage.We all like to keep fit. Dad    
makes beer and wine in the evening.Mum 
and dad and me and my brothers play    
Monopoly and Atara on the computer.We  
all like to have crumpets and soda pop 
for supper. I think I am lucky.
