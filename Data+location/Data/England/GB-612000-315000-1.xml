		<title>01Wensum Valley&amp;Felthorpe Wood</title>
		<content> The river Wensum flows in the valley. 
 Surrounding grassland is used for     
 grazing cattle. Higher ground is used 
 for agriculture growing mainly barley 
 &amp; sugar beet. Some wheat, dwarf beans,
 potatoes &amp; carrots are also grown, as 
 are daffodils for the bulbs. Away from
 the arable, woodland takes over being 
 naturally deciduous, but some has been
 managed &amp; planted with conifers.      
 Employment in the area is in agricul- 
 ture &amp; for a builders merchant &amp; a    
 garden centre. Some small self        
 employed industries also exist,       
 concrete products, printing, pet farm.
 Many people living in the area work   
 outside of it. A small private flying 
 club operates there. The old school &amp; 
 railway station are now dwellings &amp; a 
 few new dwellings have been built but 
 no estate type development exists     
 keeping the village character of area.</content>
