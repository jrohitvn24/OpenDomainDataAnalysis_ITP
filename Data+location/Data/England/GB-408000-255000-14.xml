		<title>14MEDIEVAL MARKETS.THE MOP</title>
		<content>              Of the mops that still   
 survive,it is the Alcester Mop that   
 still maintains,not just its original 
 site but also something of the past.It
    is held on the first Tuesday in    
 October and   it is the only one of   
 the three fairs that is still around  
 nowadays.It is called the mop because 
 servants were bought and sold there.  
             Alcester's first fair was 
 granted by Edward 1st to Walter de    
 Beauchamp in 1292.                    
            Nowadays the mop is a      
 funfair containing all sorts of rides 
 and stalls.The main street of Alcester
 is closed to all traffic.It travels   
 around the country stopping at places 
 such as:Alcester,Studley and          
 Stratford.Although the Alcester Mop   
 and the Studley Mop are the same mop  
 they have different names.
