		<title>18The Future of Chafford</title>
		<content> At the top of Ramsey Hill is the sight
 of the Chafford school,which has been 
 an area of{Social concern}over the    
 last year.                            
 The school was housed in the grounds  
 and buildings of the old{Michaelstow  
{Hall,}which was the most important    
 house in the area many years ago.The  
 site was taken over by the Council and
 used as a school for youths with      
 behaviour problems.Now however it has 
 been closed as the numbers of children
 sent here have fallen in recent years.
 Many local people are angry about what
 they see as a lack of concern by the  
 County;for as yet there have been no  
 indications(other than by rumour)of   
 the future of this lovely site.       
 Some local groups have tried to obtain
 permission to use some of the         
 facilities,but have as yet had no     
 success whatsoever.                   </content>
