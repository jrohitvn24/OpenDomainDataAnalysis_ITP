		<title>03The History of Breedon Hall</title>
		<content>   {                                   
    The Hall was built in the 17th     
 Century around 1660.A long time ago it
 was owned by the Curzon family and the
 servants lived there too. There were  
 three cottages originally and then it 
 was extended into the Hall in 1777. It
 is one of the largest buildings in    
 Breedon, but it is not really a Hall. 
 The Hall has now been turned into     
 flats. There are four of these flats  
 altogether.                           
    The Hall is reputed to have a ghost
 whom people believe is one of the     
 Curzon family. One of the residents of
 the Hall heard a bell ring one night  
 and when she went to investigate she  
 found no one there, but she did see a 
 shadow disappearing.
