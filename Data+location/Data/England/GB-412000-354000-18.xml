		<title>18S.P.A.C.E. Ride- Alstonfield</title>
		<content>     One morning I woke up and got     
dressed and ate a big bowl, in fact a  
very big bowl of cornflakes.  I'd only 
just found out that it was throwing it 
down with rain.  I'm going on a bike   
ride today. It's called S.P.A.C.E. and 
it's organised by the police.          
                                       
     I told my mum that it was raining 
so she rang Jim Fradley, one of the    
police for Warslow.  He said to come   
up to the school.  They were getting   
ready to come down to the grit pit.    
We'd just set off and it started to    
you know what, it was pouring down.    
We got to Waterhouses, had our dinner  
under a tree when a thunder bolt came  
straight through.  We ran down the     
bank and ran straight to the cars, and 
dried ourselves.  What an end to a     
bike ride.                             
                                       </content>
