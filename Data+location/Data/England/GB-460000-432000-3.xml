 SELBY ABBEY SCHOOL STARTED AS A CHURCH
 SCHOOL PROVIDED FOR THE CHILDREN OF   
 THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND. A PLAQUE IN THE
 HALL STATES:                          
        THIS CLASSROOM WAS BUILT BY    
 PUBLIC SUBSCRIPTION IN MEMORY OF      
 FRANCIS HARPER VICAR 1850-1888.       
        BUILT IN 1896.                 
                                       
 TODAY THINGS ARE VERY DIFFERENT AT    
 SELBY ABBEY SCHOOL .THERE ARE 180     
 CHILDREN DIVIDED INTO SIX CLASSES.IT  
 IS NO LONGER A SECONDARY SCHOOL AND IS
 NOW JUST PRIMARY.CHILDREN FROM        
 THE ABBEY SCHOOL CONTINUE THEIR       
 EDUCATION AT SELBY OR BRAYTON HIGH    
 SCHOOL.                               
   THERE WERE ONCE 600 CHILDREN AT THE 
 ABBEY SCHOOL. IN 1981 THE SCHOOL WAS  
 USED AS AN ARMY BASE WHEN SELBY WAS   
 BADLY FLOODED.                        </content>
