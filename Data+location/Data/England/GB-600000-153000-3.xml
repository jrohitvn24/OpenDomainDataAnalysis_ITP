		<content> Following is a consensus from the     
 local Womens Institute Group.  Smoking
 is regarded as anti-social.  Litter is
 a problem;  fly dumping of household  
 rubbish is rife even though official  
 tips are available.  Moral standards  
 have lowered.  Readily available      
 drugs (heroin, cannabis, marijuana)   
 and solvent abuse are a grave concern 
 with the young.   Television and      
 videos are appreciated but concern is 
 felt over excess of violence shown.   
 Women appreciate the benefits of      
 kitchen electrical appliances (washing
 machines, tumble driers, microwave    
 ovens).  There is concern over the    
 threat of Nuclear Weapons and youth   
 unemployment which is considered a    
 major cause of behavioural problems.  
 There is currently strong opposition  
 to the proposed fixed channel link.
