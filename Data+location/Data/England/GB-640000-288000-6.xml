Beccles has had a market since the     
first Domesday Book.Indeed it probably 
existed since Beccles was founded.     
The present market is situated in the  
appropriately named New Market.The     
 original market was held in what is   
now known as Old Market.This is the    
site of the Bus Station.               
The market is held every Friday and    
there are about a dozen stalls selling 
mostly fruit and vegetables.There are  
some clothes stalls.It lasts all day   
and is a popular local shopping        
feature.Getting there early in the day 
usually means getting the best produce.
A new open air market operates at      
Ellough on Sunday amid much            
controversy.
