 The group meet at the Village Hall on 
 a Tuesday afternoon from 1.00-3.00    
 every week in the school term.        
 Weighing comes first followed by      
 warm-up exercises. Different exercises
 for the different parts of the body   
 then follow followed by a cool-down   
 and relaxation. After that the ladies 
 take it in turns to make the tea      
 during which they have a discussion   
 session on topics such as hygene, food
 etc.
