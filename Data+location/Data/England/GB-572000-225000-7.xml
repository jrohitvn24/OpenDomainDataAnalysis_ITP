		<content>                                       
      One Sunday morning we went to    
 visit{Mr}and{Mrs Newman}at{Panfield   
{Hall.}The main hall was originally a  
 hospital for the{Priory.}It was built 
 away from the{Priory}because of the   
 danger of infection spreading. It     
 was orginally an 'E' shaped building  
 without the centre piece but at some  
 time the ends were sliced off. On an  
 outside wall there is a door frame    
 between the ground and first floor    
 level. It is impossible to tell why.  
 In a passage there is a piece of      
 original carved wood. There is a      
 rumour of a tunnel leading from the   
 Hall to the church.There is said to be
 the ghost of a monk in the tunnel.    
      I have some ducks and the female 
 hatched some eggs out. When the       
 ducklings had grown up we gave five to
{Mr and Mrs Newman}for their pond.     </content>
