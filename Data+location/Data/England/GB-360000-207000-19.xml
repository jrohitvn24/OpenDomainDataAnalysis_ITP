		<title>19My weekend at Parkend.</title>
		<content> On a weekend I wake at 8.30am have,   
 breakfast and watch television for an 
 hour. My friend, Paul Watkins, comes  
 down to my house to play. We sometimes
                                       
 fish down a little stream near to     
 our house in Parkend.The fish we catch
 are pretty small and mostly they are  
 Brown Trout. At 6,0clock we go        
 swimming  at Heywood Comprehensive    
 school,Cinderford.Only Parkend people 
 and a few outsiders go as it is a     
 private session.We have fish and      
 chips, watch television and go to bed 
 at 10,0,clock.On Sunday we have our   
 "Sunday Dinner" which is frozen peas, 
 roast meat, carrots, potatoes and     
 gravy.After dinner we usually visit   
 our relations for tea.
