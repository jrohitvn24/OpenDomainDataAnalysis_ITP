		<content>   THE LADY WATERFORD HALL             
  The building which is now called the 
 Lady Waterford Hall was built in 1860 
 to be the village school and it was   
 used for that purpose until 1957. In  
 1862 Lady Waterford began covering the
 walls of the schoolroom with large    
 paintings showing scenes from the     
 bible.This task took her 21 years to  
 complete.She took schoolchildren and  
 estate workers as her models. The     
 paintings were done in watercolour on 
 paper stretched on wooden frames.Over 
 the years the paintings have lost some
 of their original colour,but during   
 recent years some have been           
 professionally restored.To-day the    
 building is used as a village hall    
 where various village organisations   
 regularly meet.It is also visited by  
 many tourists each year.
