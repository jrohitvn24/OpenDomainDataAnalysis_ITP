		<title>14FOLKLORE OF THE AREA</title>
		<content> Local folk lore plays it part in      
 forming the pattern of past and       
 present life.In this area it was lnog 
 the custom to burn an effigy of       
 someone who had misbehaved morally.The
 parishioners would attend church in   
 mock mourning but one past rector is  
 reported to have warned them of God's 
 wrath over such irreverent acts.After 
 one of these warnings many children   
 are said to have died of a plague of  
 cholera.However,despite a craeful     
 scruitiny of the records,no mass      
 burials are recored.
