		<title>02A Walk through the grid</title>
		<content>   We started the walk at{Burton       
{Primary School}in Campbell Road. The  
 school is surrounded by a housing     
 estate. We went out of the main gate  
 and turned onto Salisbury Road. On the
 left hand side as we walked were some 
 fields with crops in them. To our     
 right was Burton Hall and the housing 
 estate. A small stream runs underneath
 the road and behind Burton Hall.      
 Burton Hall was being converted into a
 Public House.                         
  As we came to the centre of the      
 Village we passed the Infant school   
 and the village green to the right.   
 Burton Parish Hall and St. Luke's     
 Church were opposite.                 
  We moved on, eventually leaving the  
 village. The road went through a farm 
 where cows were kept. They obviously  
 moved the cows daily across the road  
 as there was mud on the road.         </content>
