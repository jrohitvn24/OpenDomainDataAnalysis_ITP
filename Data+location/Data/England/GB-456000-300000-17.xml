		<content>      Within this area are to be found 
 the two main sources of power for the 
 city of Leicester, the Freeman's      
 Meadow Electricity Station and the Gas
 Works. The latter used to produce coal
 gas, but is now just a natural gas    
 storage and distibution centre.       
      Two major markets are also       
 situated within this area. The whole- 
 -sale fruit and vegetable market is   
 open all week, while a cattle market  
 operates on Wednesdays for the sale   
 and slaughter of livestock.           
      Leicester was always renown for  
 its wide range of industries and this 
 is reflected within the area. Off the 
 main roads there are to be found many 
 small manufacturing and service indus-
 -tries, but the main concentrations   
 are in two areas (1) Freeman's Common 
 Industrial Estate &amp; (2) Knighton      
 Fields Industrial Estate.             </content>
