		<content>       Mrs Youlden's grandfather and   
 father worked as the village          
 blacksmiths ,here's what she said they
 used to do.                           
 "Shoeing horses, making iron bars,    
 special irons bars for protecting     
 people. They used to make iron hoops  
 for the little boys.And if they got   
 broken they would mend them.The boys  
 used to like to come into the         
 blacksmithshop and blow the bellows,  
 and they would like to see all the    
 sparks flying". The blacksmith shop is
 now just a boarded up shed rarely     
 used.                                 
   "Mr.Dickiwinters,the Headmaster of  
 the school,had a mallaca cane for     
 naughty boys!The girls played skipping
 ,rounders &amp; hopscotch,and they also   
 had wooden hoops while the boy's      
 played football of course and the game
 called "Jumpback".                    </content>
