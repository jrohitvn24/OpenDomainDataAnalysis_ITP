   Modern amenities that are taken so  
 much for granted in populated areas,  
 are not easy of access in this part of
 Shropshire.A car is an absolute       
 necessity to the inhabitants of the   
 hamlets and isolated farmhouses.There 
 is only one bus a week to Shrewsbury, 
 it travels through the countryside on 
 a Tuesday morning,picking up          
 passengers at gateways and turnings,  
 dropping them off again in the        
 afternoon,their only link with        
 civilisation_if a link is needed and  
 this is debatable. Shops,doctors,     
 clinic,dentist,Post Office,Banks are  
 all 8 miles away in Church Stretton.  
 The Church is at Cardington,5 miles   
 distant and the Junior School is about
 3 miles.The travelling Library calls  
 every 2 weeks,but there is no         
 travelling shop as in some parts.     </content>
