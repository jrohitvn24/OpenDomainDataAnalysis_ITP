 The villages of Fenton,Kettlethorpe &amp; 
 Hardwick lie approximately twelve     
 miles North West of Lincoln in the    
 relatively flat Trent valley. It is   
 essentially a rural area with arable, 
 livestock and poultry farming as its  
 main industries. There are very few   
 amenities,public transport is limited 
 and as people have to travel out of   
 the area for shopping, schooling and  
 medical care, private vehicles are a  
 necessity. However, a variety of      
 mobile services visit the area. The   
 church of St.Peter &amp; St.Paul serves   
 two parishes sharing a vicar with     
 three other churches. It stands next  
 to historic Kettlethorpe Hall and near
 to the Village Hall, centre for       
 community activities. This is a       
 peaceful area in which to live        
 surrounded by pleasant countryside.   </content>
