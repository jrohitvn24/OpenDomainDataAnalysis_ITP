		<content> The Donington Collection of Single    
 Seater Racing Cars, a museum belonging
 to the owner of Donington Park Racing 
 Circuit, was opened in 1973. It houses
 the world's largest collection of     
 single seater racing cars as well as a
 collection of racing motorcycles.     
 The display of over 100 Grand Prix    
 racing cars of all ages, varying from 
 Austin 7 Racers to the recent         
 Championship Winners McLaren, portrays
 the history and development of both   
 the sport and the cars.               
 On the wall of the museum foyer are   
 the autographs of famous motor racing 
 drivers.                              
 The museum is open 7 days a week and  
 employs two full time staff. Within   
 the museum complex are a motor racing 
 accessories shop and a cafeteria.
