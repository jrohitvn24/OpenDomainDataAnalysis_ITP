		<content>      In 1716 George Ley left property 
 in his will to endow a free school.   
 The building used was an old market   
 house near the church.                
      In 1875 the school was           
 reorganised into separate Boys and    
 Girls schools.  In 1906, because of   
 overcrowding, further building work   
 was needed and the Infants were taught
 in the Baptist school room.   It was  
 not until 1923 that all the children  
 were accomodated in the same building.
      In 1926 the new Senior School    
 was built at the Seaside end of the   
 village.  In 1969 the Senior School   
 children were transferred to the new  
 Comprehensive School in Ilfracombe and
 in early 1971,after building          
 alterations, 196 Primary School       
 children moved in.  By a strange      
 coincidence there were also 196       
 children at the school in July 1985.  </content>
