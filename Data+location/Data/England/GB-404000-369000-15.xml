		<content> These are the two best known landmarks
 of our area.{Grin Low}is a hill{1440  
{feet(455metres)}high. The word {'Low' 
 is  Anglo-Saxon for small mound;      
 usually a burial mound. When it was   
 excvated in 1894 a {neolithic burial  
{mound}was discovered. 3 skeletons and 
 the burnt remains of others and some  
 food jars were found.                 
 c1836 a tower was built on Grin Low to
 give work to local unemployed men.  By
 the 1890s it had collapsed. In{1896}a 
 local farmer{-Solomon Mycock-}built a 
 folly known now as {Solomon's Temple.}
 It is a round, one storey tower with  
 a castellated top and large rounded   
 top windows. From the top you get a   
 good view of our survey area and of   
 Mam Tor, Kinder Scout and Buxton town.
 We sheltered there on our field trip.
