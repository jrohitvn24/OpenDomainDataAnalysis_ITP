		<title>01THE SELSFIELD AREA</title>
		<content> This is an area bordered on the north 
 by{Worth}Parish, on the east and south
 east by{West Hoathly}and on the west  
 and south west by{Balcombe}Parish.    
   The main road, the B.2028, on the   
 east side, from{Selsfield}southwards, 
 was made in Saxon times close to the  
{Roman road}which had become overgrown.
   The area is part of a gently        
 undulating lowland flanking the west  
 side of the{Wealden dome,}varying in  
 height between 190m and 108m. It is   
 dissected by the north-south head     
 streams of{Ardingly Brook}and{Cob     
{Brook}which are tributaries of the    
{River Ouse.}This is an entirely rural 
 area with cottages, large houses,     
 farms and estates but no main         
 settlement. In the north east         
{Selsfield Common}is owned by the      
{National Trust.}Other estates are in  
 private ownership.                    </content>
