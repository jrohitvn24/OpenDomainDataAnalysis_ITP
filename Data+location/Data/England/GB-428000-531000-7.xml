		<title>07Shops in Ferryhill</title>
		<content> The main shopping centre is in and    
 around the market place.Other small   
 groupings occur in Dean Bank,Ferry-   
 hill Station and the Broom.There are  
 no shops in either Stobbs Cross or    
 Mainsforth.                           
 In Ferryhill there are two large super
 markets and a number of specialised   
 food shops such as butchers and       
 bakers.As the largest town in the area
 tere are also furnishing,clothing,    
 electrical and hardware shops.        
 A feature of the region is the corner 
 shop-general dealers with a localised 
 clientele.Many of these are in danger 
 of closure due to increased           
 competition especially from           
 supermarkets.
