		<title>13RECENT GROWTH OF WOODINGDEAN</title>
		<content> Woodingdean has only been developed   
 recently.In 1953 there were still     
 parts without roads,pavements or      
 street lights.On the main road where  
 there are now shops, there were       
 prefabricated houses and an old farm  
 building.There were few shops         
 nearby.The present supermarket was a  
 small temporary building. The         
 surrounding land was farmed.Breeding  
 pigs was common then, where as today  
 arable farming is the major           
 feature. The housing was              
 private,the council estate had not    
 been built.In the 1930's there was no 
 main water supplied and water was     
 delivered by donkey cart.             
   The oldest building is an industrial
 school which was an extensian of the  
 workhouse in Brighton and used to     
 train poor children for jobs.It is now
 a Catholic Middle School.             </content>
