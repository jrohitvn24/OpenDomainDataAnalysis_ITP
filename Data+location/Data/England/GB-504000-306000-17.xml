		<title>17The Village Hall</title>
		<content> The Village Hall is used by Uffington 
 Womens Institute on the first         
 Wednesday of each month.The Girl      
 Guides meet there each Thursday       
 evening_they also join up with Bainton
 and Ashton Guides for visits and      
 summer camps.The local Brass Band     
 practice there every Tuesday night and
 the Youth Club use the Hall each      
 Friday and Sunday for snooker,pool,   
 billiards and table tennis.Youth Club 
 age limits are 12-21years.Many private
 parties and discos are also held      
 there.At the back of the hall is a    
 Kitchen and a billard room.An         
 extension is being planned because    
 space is limited and half of the      
 proceeds from this years village fete 
 will go towards this project.This     
 quaint Village Hall is one of the few 
 remaining thatched roofed village     
 buildings.                            </content>
