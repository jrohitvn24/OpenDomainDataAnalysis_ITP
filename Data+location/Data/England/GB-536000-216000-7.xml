		<title>07SWANGLES FARM.</title>
		<content> We visited some of the farms in the   
 Rib valley,to interview the farmers.  
{SWANGLES FARM}is no longer a working  
 farm. Many of the buildings date from 
 1901,when there was a dairy here. Many
 of the locals can still remember going
 to this dairy to buy their milk       
 straight from the cow. These buildings
 were farm cottages and several of the 
 local people were born in them. The   
 old barns alongside the cottages are  
 being renovated. They were built in   
 1730 and a condition for the planning 
 permission,is that the new building   
 must be constructed using the original
 timbers. The fields around the farm   
 have changed in recent years,because  
 many hedges have been removed and     
 ditches have been filled in to enlarge
 them. The old fields had names such as
{"Gypsyfield","Peartree field"}and     
{"Nine acre field".}                   </content>
