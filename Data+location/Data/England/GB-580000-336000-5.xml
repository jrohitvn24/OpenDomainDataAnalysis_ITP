 In appearance, the flint and brick    
 cottages of Stanhoe seem not to have  
 changed very much but in fact this is 
 deceptive, for the rows and yards     
 which in the past housed many large   
 families in c1950 have been updated so
 that the houses now provide quite     
 substantial and compact homes.  With  
 the falling population this has been  
 an acceptable change.  There has      
 recently been the addition of four old
 peoples' bungalows.  The rows of      
 Council houses have stood for thirty  
 and fifty years.  Within the last few 
 years new houses have been and are    
 still being built, some large for     
 their small plots, some bungalows, and
 a terrace of three.  Altogether there 
 have been twelve additions since 1980.
