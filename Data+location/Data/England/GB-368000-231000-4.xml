		<title>04Ann Cam School, Dymock</title>
		<content> Our school was founded in 1820 and    
 took its name from Miss Ann Cam who   
 lived in Dymock and died in 1790 and  
 left money in her will to build a     
 school. In 1891 education became free 
 but until then the children paid their
 'pence' each week. Farmers' children  
 paid 3d., tradesmen paid 2d and       
 labourers paid 1d per child per week. 
 There were separate schools for boys  
 and girls until 1922. They did not    
 have to leave at 11 like they do now. 
 Ann Cam School became a Primary School
 in 1951. The new school was opened on 
 the 14th May 1974 by the Bishop of    
 Tewkesbury. Mr Hale was the Headmaster
 then.
