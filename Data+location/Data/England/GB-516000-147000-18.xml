      Sixty children aged 12 were asked
 about improvements they would like to 
 see in their area.                    
      These are the six most popular   
 choices:                              
 1)Provision of properly equiped play  
 areas near the estates.               
 2)No furthur building of new houses   
 or offices.                           
 3)Cycle tracks to be built on the     
 sides of main roads.                  
 4)A footbridge across the Horsham Road
 and a pelican croosing to be reopened 
 at Spook Hill,near the shops.         
 5)More garages/parking areas are to be
 supplied on the Goodwyns Estate.The   
 grass verges are being spoilt by      
 people  parking their Cars on them.   
 6)Dog toilets to be built to stop
