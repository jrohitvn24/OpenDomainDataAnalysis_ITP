		<content> Part of the Rossendale Way path has   
 been surfaced in concrete by the{North
{West Water Authority}since this is the
 main means of vehicular access to     
 Scoutmoor High Level Reservoir. From  
 here there are fine views of the lower
 Rossendale Valley dominated by the    
 Peel Monument and the valley of       
 Dearden Brook. Across this valley the 
 line of the dismantled tramway can be 
 easily picked out. The path proceedes 
 along the edge a pine woodland and    
 then joins part of the original Bury  
 Old Road known today as Micheal Wife  
 Lane. This old highway then crosses   
 Dearden Brook via a small footbridge. 
 This stretch of the stream is well    
 known as a local beauty spot, much    
 used by families on a picnic outing.
