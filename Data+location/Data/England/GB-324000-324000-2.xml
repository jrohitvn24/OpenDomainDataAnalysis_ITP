		<content>  {THE CHANGING FACE OF TREFONEN}      
                                       
 Originally Trefonen was a very small  
 village,not more than three miles from
 Oswestry. Since then,people have been 
 building more houses and Trefonen has 
 grown considerably larger.            
 The population has risen so high that 
 the old Trefonen school had to be     
 extended.There are now ninety_six     
 children in the school.Martin's stores
 was also extended and now is something
 like a mini_supermarket.Most of the   
 building recently has been up the top 
 or higher parts of Trefonen,especially
 down Hollies lane.A large house is    
 also being built up Martin's bank.    
 People choose Trefonen to live in     
 mainly because it's in the country,but
 the town is conviently near.Alot more 
 children are moving to Trefonen,so the
 school is having yet another extension</content>
