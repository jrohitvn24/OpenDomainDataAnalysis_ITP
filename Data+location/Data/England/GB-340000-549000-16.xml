		<title>16STONERAISE PRIMARY SCHOOL(2)</title>
		<content> The present headmaster,Mr,Sanderson,  
 is retiring at the end of the 1985    
 summer term after 23 years as the Head
 of Stoneraise school.He told us that  
 in its heyday there were 128 pupils in
 the school.In 1985 there are 75.He    
 said that very few of the children who
 came to the school were from the      
 farms.This is in contrast to a few    
 years ago because nowadays farming is 
 labour_intensive and fewer people work
 on the farms.Most of the children here
 come from Durdar Rd. on the outskirts 
 of Carlisle.The Ribble Bus Company    
 extend their local service twice a day
 to transport the children to and from 
 the school.Over half the children are 
 brought in cars.Mr.Sanderson has      
 enjoyed being at the school.He thinks 
 that education is more relaxed and    
 informal nowadays and the curriculum  
 is much broader.                      </content>
