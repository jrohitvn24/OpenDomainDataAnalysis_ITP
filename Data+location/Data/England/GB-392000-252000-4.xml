		<content> The area is mainly devoted to farming.
 The soil is predominantly heavy clay  
 but fertile and is divided equally    
 between arable crops and pasture.     
 Cereals are the main crops with winter
 sown wheat occupying the largest area.
 Arable farming is completely          
 mechanised. the tractors used are very
 powerful in order to pull the heavy   
 duty cultivating machinery. The grain 
 is harvested by large combines and the
 straw is baled for winter bedding and 
 fodder for the livestock.With present 
 day heavy crops there is a surplus of 
 straw which is now often burned in the
 field, but there is a growing dislike 
 of this practice because of air       
 pollution and damage to wildlife      
 habitat.
