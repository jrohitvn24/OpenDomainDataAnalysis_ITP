		<content> The bed of the old{GWR}branch line    
 called the {Kingsmead "Loop"}lies east
 of{Kingsmead Mill.}It joined the main 
 Swindon to Bristol line with the      
 Malmesbury branch line at Little      
 Somerford Station from 1933 to 1951.  
 The keeper's house,now owned by{David 
{Puttnam}and the crossing gates still  
 exist.The 10km Malmesbury to Dauntsey 
 line was opened in 1877 and closed in 
 1962.Now it's possible to walk part of
 the overgrown line which is a good    
 habitat for wild life.                
 South of Kingsmead Mill is {Little    
{Somerford Viaduct}of 13 arches which  
 carry{Intercity 125}trains on the     
 Swindon to South Wales line completed 
 in 1903.Village women sold            
 refreshments and home brewed beer to  
 the navvies building the viaduct.Some 
 navvies were injured or killed while  
 it was being built.                   </content>
