		<title>14DOGMERSFIELD HOUSE:GARDEN</title>
		<content> A survey of Dogmersfield Manor in the 
 Domesday Book notes a church and a    
 mill, the whole Manor valued at 100s  
 and in the gift of Edward the         
 Confessor. Henry II allowed part of   
 his Royal Park at Odiham to be        
 enclosed by his Bishop and the        
 Dogmersfield estate grew to 2000      
 acres. In 1985,the portion belonging  
 to the house consists of 27 acres. The
 grounds surround the Manor and contain
 many fine mature trees. There is also 
 a walled herb garden,an orchard,tennis
 courts and a pair of brick dovecotes: 
 one ancient, one rebuilt. The Park    
 contains a small private cemetery     
 where the remains of 6 brothers of the
 De La Salle order were buried between 
 1958 and 1968. Adjacent lie 3 other   
 graves. The gardens are being restored
 by the new owners, Amdahl
