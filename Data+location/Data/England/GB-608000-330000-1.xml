		<title>01THREE NORTH NORFOLK VILLAGES</title>
		<content> Corpustry, Saxthorpe and Little       
 London, on the Norwich to Holt Road,  
 form a straggling community on either 
 side of the river Bure. The undulating
 countryside, a network of arable      
 fields, grassland, hedgerows and mixed
 woodland on light sandy soil, is      
 devoted to farming amd market         
 gardening. Employment is generally in 
 farming.  Other work is in the general
 store and bakery, primary school,     
 three garages, saw mill, small        
 plastics factory and people also work 
 in Norwich and nearby towns. Because  
 public transport is limited they      
 commute by car. The post Office and   
 15th century St. Andrews chuch in     
 Saxthorpe serve the whole community.  
 The village Hall, in Corpusty,        
 accommodates the Youth Club, Women's  
 Institute, Mother's Union, Parish     
 Council, Whist Drives, Bingo, Discos  </content>
