		<title>20BONFIRE NIGHT</title>
		<content>    Several nights before{November 5th,
 the scouts were out collecting wood on
 strange trailer-like contraptions and 
 taking it to Lower Farm for the       
{bonfire. }As the loads continued, the 
 bonfire grew until it was 5 or 6      
 metres high. {A guy}was made from old 
 clothes &amp; straw stuffing &amp; it was     
 placed on the top.  Approximately{Â£200
{worth of fireworks}were bought and    
 fixed in groups around the area.      
 Ropes guarded the centre of the field 
 so the public would be{safe.          
    Tickets were available from two    
 weeks before &amp; admission was available
 on the night but more expensive.      
 People flocked in. Hot_dogs,sparklers 
 and hot drinks were on sale.  It went 
 very well and was very enjoyable.     
    Â£200 went up in smoke but the      
 scouts got it back in gate money and  
 the community enjoyed it.             </content>
