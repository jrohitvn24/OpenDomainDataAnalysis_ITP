		<title>06THE CAVENDISHES-HOLKER MOSS</title>
		<content>   Much of the Furness area,including  
 Holker Moss,is owned by the           
{Cavendishes,}who rent out the land to 
 tenant farmers.                       
   In the early 17th century a family  
 called the{Prestons}owned{Holker Hall.
 The land on which it was built was    
 owned by{Cartmel Priory.}Richard      
 Preston who was Prior at Cartmel      
 continued to farm the surrounding land
 after 1536.In 1640 Thomas Preston had 
 his estates sequestrated by Parliament
 for his royalism.However he recovered 
 them for a sum of Â£1592.Shortly after 
 this time the male line of the        
 Prestons became extinct.The{Lowthers} 
 then took hold of both the Hall and   
 its estates.They in turn handed the   
 establishment down to the{Cavendishes.
 The Cavendish family is connected with
 local events like the popular{Lakeland
{Rose Show}held on the estate in July. </content>
