 P.E,Games,and Woodwork.Mrs Short cooks
 the dinners for us we pay Â£3.35p for  
 five days.We win just as many         
 competitions as any of the bigger     
 Schools.We go on lots of school trips 
 to the seaside and other places.We    
 have apparatus for P.E.We have two    
 sports days.One at Ingleby School and
