		<title>07LIFEGUARDS AT SANDYMOUTH</title>
		<content> On Sandymouth Beach from the end of   
 May to mid-September, 2 lifeguards are
 on duty between 10:00 and 6:00. Their 
 first duty is to check the surf       
 conditions and decide on the siting of
 the safe bathing area flags.If they   
 consider that no bathing is possible, 
 then a{red flag}is shown. The times of
 safe-bathing are also posted on a     
 clear sign by the beach track.        
   They then keep a close watch on the 
 beach and often wade into the water if
 there is a large number of people in  
 the sea.It is important that they     
 are strong swimmers and can apply{    
{resuscitation techniques.}A{Petersen  
{Tube}and{Rescue Board}are on the beach
 for immediate use.As the tide advances
 the flags are moved further back up   
 the beach.In good weather the duty    
 hours may be extended if a large      
 number of bathers remain after 6:00.  </content>
