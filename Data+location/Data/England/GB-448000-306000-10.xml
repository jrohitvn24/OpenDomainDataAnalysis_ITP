		<title>10GROBY WOMENS INSTITUTE.</title>
		<content>    The Womens Institute is a          
 flourishing group comprising 62       
 members.They range in age from 15 to  
 83.The group is one of the 200 in     
 Leicestershire.Meetings are held once 
 a month in the village hall and       
 usually begin with the singing of     
 'Jerusalem'.The minutes of the        
 previous meeting are then read and any
 matters arising dealt with.A          
 discussion follows on forthcoming     
 events and on the county newsletter   
 which lists courses and competitions. 
 Quite often there is then an outside  
 speaker who may illustrate their talk 
 with slides.This is followed by a 20  
 minute break for refreshments.The     
 meeting ends with a 'social half      
 hour',when there may be a competition 
 or a game such as Bingo or Beetle may 
 be played.
