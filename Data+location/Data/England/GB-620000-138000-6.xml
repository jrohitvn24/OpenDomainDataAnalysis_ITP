		<title>06The Youth Adventure Centre</title>
		<content> The development of a Youth Adventure  
 Centre in the old Officers Mess of the
 former Battle of Britain airfield, and
 the use of 9 acres of surrounding     
 land,make this one of the major       
 developments in the village.          
   The centre has a capacity for 200   
 young people at any one time.Visitors 
 come from all over the country and    
 from the continent.The visitors use   
 local facilities,Folkestone &amp; District
 sporting facilities and visit local   
 historic centres such as Canterbury   
 Cathedral.                            
   It is still hoped that an Olympic   
 sized swimming pool and running track 
 will be built with facilities for     
 other sports. Any facilities are      
 available for local use.              
   The Centre was officially opened by 
 the Duke of Gloucester on Monday,May
