 The Olde Gaol is 206 years old, having
 been built in 1779. Used as a gaol    
 until 1782,it closed down for lack of 
 prisoners. 50 years later it became a 
 Police Station. In 1839 an extension  
 was built to house the Inspector. In  
 1892 it became a fire station,then a  
 cafe. It was used as an antique shop  
 from 1975-83,and is now expected to   
 become a museum.
