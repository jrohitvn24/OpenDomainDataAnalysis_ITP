		<content> The{River Welland}runs through Market 
 Deeping and Deeping St James.Thousands
 of people fish on the river every     
 year but there are other sports like  
 raft-racing and boating.The river has 
 a lot of wildlife like birds,otters,  
 kingfishers and water rats.The river  
 benefits the people of the Deepings   
 area because they don't have to go far
 to go fishing.Deeping St.James Angling
 Club has been the sole owner of the   
 river for 400 years. There is a       
 bailiff who is responsible for the    
 river from Spalding to the other side 
 of Stamford,and who comes from the    
 Anglian Water Authority.The people who
 live on the river bank have to cut it 
 and keep it tidy and it makes a       
 pleasant surrounding.There are two    
 weirs on the river which help to      
 control the flow of water.
