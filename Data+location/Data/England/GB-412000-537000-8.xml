		<title>08TOW LAW J.M. &amp; I. SCHOOL.</title>
		<content> Tow Law has two primary schools; a    
 small R.C. Aided School and the County
 School. Opened in 1954 this replaced  
 the existing "tin" school. It is built
 on the southern edge of Tow Law, and  
 has extensive open views.             
                                       
 At the present time there are approx. 
 180 pupils in the school with one     
 class per age-group from 5-11 years.  
 There are 9 teachers employed in the  
 school, together with kitchen staff,  
 cleaners, etc.                        
                                       
 Generally the lessons are taken with  
 the class teacher. Swimming lessons   
 are held for the 9-11 year olds at a  
 school pool in Wolsingham (3 miles).  
                                       
 At 11 the children transfer to the    
 Comprehensive School in Wolsingham.
