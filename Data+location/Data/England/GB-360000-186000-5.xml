		<title>05Shopping in Alveston</title>
		<content> Alveston has a butcher,               
 hardware, clothes shop,a post office  
 and paper shop, hairdressers,         
 greengrocers and grocers shop.        
    We did a survey on the shop-keepers
 and the shoppers.We asked the         
 shop_keepers questions like did they  
 think the bigger shops nearby take    
 their trade away.Most of the          
 shop_keepers said they did.They told  
 us that they thought the shoppers     
 mostly used them for odds and ends,and
 that it was mainly the old people who 
 used them to do their main shop.      
    The majority of the shoppers said  
 they lived in Alveston but they       
 shopped at places like Safeway and    
 Carrefour and thought that meat,fruit 
 and veg were not as good as the       
 quality that they could get from the  
 local shops.                          
                                       </content>
