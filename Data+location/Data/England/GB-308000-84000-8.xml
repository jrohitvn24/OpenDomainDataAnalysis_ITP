		<title>08A TYPICAL DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content>   I get up at 7.30, wash, get changed 
 and have breakfast. We leave for      
 school at 8.45 and get there at       
 8.50. I start school at 9.00. We have 
 playtime at 10.30. School dinners are 
 at 12.00. In between ,we do Maths,    
 Drawing or English. After dinner we   
 have playtime, then at 1.15pm we      
 go back in class and start work again.
 Sometimes we do sports, football or   
 rounders. At 3.30 we go home. At  home
 I watch the TV and play with the music
 centre or my dad's C.B.radio. Often, I
 play outside with Simon my            
 brother,usually football in the winter
 or cricket in the summer. I have tea, 
 play and then I go to bed at about    
 nine O'clock.
