		<content> Mr &amp; Mrs Manning have got two old     
 shell cases from the Americans tanks. 
 What the Americans did was to fire    
 shells at concrete blocks on the      
 beach.After they had demolished the   
 blocks another group would have a go. 
   To get to school Mrs Manning walked 
 about two miles. She took sandwiches  
 to Georgeham School because there were
 no school  dinners.The school had 3   
 classes and about 80 children went to 
 this school much the same as today.   
   Some of the roads were first tarred 
 in 1927.
