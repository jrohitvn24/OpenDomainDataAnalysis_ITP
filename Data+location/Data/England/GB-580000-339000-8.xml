		<title>08BURNHAM MARKET - POPULATION</title>
		<content>    There are nearly 400 people living 
 in the survey area, and most of these 
 live in the council housing just south
 of the village centre. We have a large
 population of elderly people: most of 
 the private houses are owned by people
 who have moved to Burnham Market after
 their retirement.                     
    Burnham Market is in the county of 
 Norfolk and is in the Westminster     
 parliamentary constituency of West    
 Norfolk - our Member of Parliament is 
 Henry Bellingham, and our Euro-M.P. is
 Paul Howell. We are part of the       
 Borough of King's Lynn and West       
 Norfolk. Our representatives are      
 Squadron Leader Oliver on the         
 county council and Viscount Coke on   
 the borough council. The parish       
 council, which consists of 11 people  
 elected every three years, meets      
 monthly in the village hall.          </content>
