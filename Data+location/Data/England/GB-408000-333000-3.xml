		<content>Once the headmaster gave four boys the 
cane as they did not raise their caps  
to him in town.About 1922 she used to  
go down the 'rec'. There were a few    
swings and a fresh water swimming pool.
If you stood on a swing you got told   
off. To get to the Catholic high school
Stoke she caught a train.If she was    
late it waited.I would never do that   
now.There was no gym  at school. To    
exercise they marched around saying    
time tables. She remembers rationing in
the 2nd World War for                  
sugar,bacon,flour,meat,fruit,clothes   
and eggs. There was no coffee and only 
3o spoons of sugar a week for her      
family.Now she is a teacher. In an air 
raid children took their books to a    
shelter and got on .One plane dropped a
bomb through a house but it did not go 
off.After the war there was a party in 
the cattle market.We liked her talk.   </content>
