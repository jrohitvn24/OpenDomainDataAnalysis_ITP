		<title>03Derivation of Fairford</title>
		<content> Fairford first got its name from the  
 old  ford in the River Coln.The name  
{"Fair"}means easy to cross.The ford   
 was made about 900 years ago,which was
 in the Saxon times.The Saxon word for 
 Fairford is{Fagranforda.}Where the    
 river divides,the piece of grass in   
 the middle is called the{Chalice      
{Piece.   }                            
 The Chalice  belonged to the          
 Church at that time.Drovers taking    
 cattle along the roads from one place 
 to another used the ford .They would  
 throw coins in the ford for good      
 luck.There were wide verges for the   
 cattle to walk on, which also provided
 food on their journeys.
