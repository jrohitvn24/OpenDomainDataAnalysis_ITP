		<title>04EMPLOYMENT:         QUINTON</title>
		<content>   The{population}of Quinton, being    
 about{3,000,}is divided equally       
 between{service and civilian families.
   However, almost three quarters of   
 the workers have jobs related to the  
{army base.                            
   The size of the village has doubled 
 since the base opened and whilst      
 bringing in soldiers, it has created  
 jobs for some who have left farming.  
   The local{farms}are now worked by a 
{mere handful}of tenants, owners and   
 labourers, with additional, seasonal  
 contract labour.                      
   Of the remaining workers, many work 
 in{tourist trades in Stratford,}some  
{commute}to Coventry, Birmingham and   
 other industrial and commercial       
 centres.There are also a variety of   
{professions and businesses}represented
 in the village.                       
                                       </content>
