		<title>03A day in the life of Mary</title>
		<content> An ordinary school day for me starts  
 about 5.30. At 6.00 I have a breakfast
 of cornflakes with goats'milk. After  
 breakfast I get dressed, milk the     
{goats,}and then I let out the{ducks.  
 It takes about 15 minutes to milk the 
 goats. After I've milked them I give  
 them hay and water. It's about 7.00 by
 the time I've finished. At 8.45 I     
 catch the school coach. By the time we
 reach school it's about 9.00 but      
 school starts at 9.15. In the morning 
 we do{Maths}and{English.}At 10.30 we  
 have Assembly and then a break. We    
 come in from break at 11.00. Afternoon
 is usually project work, music, art,  
 or games. When I go home I usually    
 make cheese from goats' milk, herbs   
 and salt. I then go to bed at about   
 9.00.                                 
                                       
                                       </content>
