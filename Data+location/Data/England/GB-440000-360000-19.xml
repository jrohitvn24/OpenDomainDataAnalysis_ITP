		<title>19TIBSHELF FISHING CLUB</title>
		<content>                                       
 We have a fishing club in Tibshelf    
 and                                   
 on Sundays my dad goes with them for  
 fishing matches. My brother Mark goes 
 with him because he is in the big     
 boys' group. I sometimes go as well.  
                                       
 We go fishing near Tibshelf and to    
 places further away, like the River   
 Trent. Last Sunday my dad won the     
 men's section and our Mark came second
 in the big boys' group.               
                                       
 Every year, when the season has       
 finished, we have a big presentation  
 when all the prizes and trophies are  
 given out. Last year my dad won the   
 Ken Gent Shield.
