		<title>07HOUSING IN AYLESBURY</title>
		<content>  Aylesbury has a variety of house     
styles from seventeenth century {brick 
and timber} houses in the town centre  
{ Victorian} terraces and modern       
estates of brick built houses.         
  Current trends in housing are towards
smaller houses with small gardens. This
is in response to land prices which    
have increased 1,000% since 1978.      
Expensive houses are built at a density
of 2-4 houses to an acre, whilst       
estates have a density of 10 or more   
houses to an acre.{Counci}l housing has
shown a rapid decline in recent years. 
  Aylesbury is an {expanding} town, in 
1981 the population was 50,000 and is  
expected to rise to 60,000 in 1991.    
This has resulted in the building of   
housing estates on the edges of the    
town.
