		<title>18TIBSHELF RABBIT CLUB</title>
		<content> We have a rabbit club in Tibshelf. My 
 mam and dad help run a rabbit show on 
 the third Sunday of each month.       
 When it is a rabbit show we have to   
 put the pens up and some tables and   
 chairs. There are two big tables and  
 we have to put white cloths on them.  
 We put some long boards on trestles   
 and then metal pens on top. My sister 
 Julie and I put sawdust in the pens   
 and fix the numbers.                  
                                       
 The show starts at 7.00 p.m. and there
 is a raffle as well as judging the    
 rabbits. There are usually about 40   
 entries. The winners get certificates,
 rosettes or cups. I help put the      
 certificates on the pens and after the
 show I help to put the tables away    
 again.
