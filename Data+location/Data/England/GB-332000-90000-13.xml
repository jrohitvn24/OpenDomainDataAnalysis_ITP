		<title>13WOODROFFE SCHOOL LYME REGIS</title>
		<content> The Woodroffe School started in the   
 1920's and it was held in the Woodmead
 Halls.  It was founded by Alban       
 Woodroffe.  In the 60's it became a   
 grammar school then became            
 comprehensive.  Two more Headmasters  
 were in charge, Mr Greenwood and Mr   
 Pearn and now in the 80's Mr          
 Butterworth is in charge, but he will 
 soon be leaving and at the start of   
 the Autumn term 1985 Mr Vittle will be
 taking charge.  Now we have a big     
 school there are four craft rooms and 
 also maths, french, and science rooms.
 There are also tennis courts and a top
 field for games.
