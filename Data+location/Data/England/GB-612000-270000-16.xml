		<title>16Sports in Occold.</title>
		<content>The sports in Occold are quite varied. 
One of the most popular sports that    
people do is football. There are 21    
people who like playing football in our
School.Other sports are swimming,tennis
ballet,fishing,horse riding,gymnastics 
and judo.We have not got many sports   
facilities in Occold but we have got   
table tennis and football,but for most 
the sports we have to go out of Occold.
I have done a Mini-marathon and this   
year two of my friends are having a go 
at it.You have to do a lot of training 
for a Mini-marathon. It's so nerve     
racking when you are lined up at the   
start,the starting gun goes and you are
off. You should go at a steady pace    
because going too fast you could wear  
yourself out. You have about 13 check- 
outs along the way,one every mile.When 
you have finished you feel really good 
because you have completed it.         </content>
