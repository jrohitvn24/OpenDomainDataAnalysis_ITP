		<content>  North  of  the  River  Greta   grassy
 fields  &amp;  hedges  cover  the drumlins
 from  which   farms take  their names,
 e.g. Whaitber - wheat hill.   South of
 the river  pasture  still predominates
 but there  are  patches  of  deciduous
 woodland.   The  River has cut through
 shale  &amp;  clay  and  winds  along  its
 pebbly bed,  under Burton Bridge  then
 over rocky ledges  between steep banks
 as  it  passes  Greeta  House.     The
 hummocks  &amp;  hollows on  its  southern
 side are the remains  of coal and clay
 pits of the 18th &amp; 19th centuries. The
 village is dominated by the tall spire
 of the church beside the village green
 close  to  the Norman  castle mound at
 the end of High St.  Four streets form
 a    rectangle    on   the    northern
 valley-side &amp; are bordered by cottages
 &amp;  houses  built mainly  of sandstone.
