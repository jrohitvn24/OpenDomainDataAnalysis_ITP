		<title>13BEEHIVE PUB</title>
		<content> The Beehive pub looks quite grubby    
 from the outside and painted in white 
 and red colours.The inside was        
 surprisingly small with a little bar  
 at one end of it and some seats and   
 benches at the other.There were three 
 people in the pub including the bar   
 attendant. The walls were full of     
 pictures. There is no entertainment in
 the evening but it gets quite a few   
 customers most of which are locals.   
 The owner starts his day at about     
 7.30am. and does not finish his work  
 till midnight. He does have a break in
 the afternoon. The inside of the pub  
 is pleasant and the owners wife said  
 she has worked there for twenty-one   
 years. She thinks it was much better  
 back in the sixties.
