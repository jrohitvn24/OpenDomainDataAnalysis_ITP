		<title>15HOUSING IN THEALE</title>
		<content> Most of the housing in the area is    
 concentrated in the south-eastern     
 corner. In the 18th century the       
 village of Theale owed its importance 
 to the coaching industry and there was
 a decline in its fortunes until the   
 20th century. The housing in the 3km  
 square centered on 635715 was mostly  
 built in the 20th century, although   
 there are a few 18th and 19th century 
 buildings. A survey of the housing was
 conducted by Theale Primary School in 
 July 1985. There were 250 owner -     
 occupied houses, 20 houses rented from
 the local authority and 18 houses     
 rented by Estate workers. 64 houses   
 were detached; 136 semi-detached; 48  
 were terraced and 42 were bungalows.  
 Houses and their gardens occupied 7%  
 of the total land cover in the 3km    
 block surveyed by the group.
