		<title>03The Domesday Project Poem</title>
		<content> Writing out interviews copying maps   
 Working neatly,there's no mishaps,    
 Houses built with cement and bricks   
 Others were made with axes and picks  
 Last time it was written was in 1086. 
                                       
 Visiting companies,going on walks     
 Attending meetings,listening to talks 
 Colouring pictures is all in our part,
 Looking at mudtracks used by a cart,  
 Making school models in afternoon Art.
                                       
 Drawing houses,studying their looks   
 Reading the W.I.'s Jubilee Books,     
 Watching crafts that go on in Longhope
 Walking down MayHill and its steep    
                      slanting slope   
 Do the Domesday Project don't sit down
                              and mope.
