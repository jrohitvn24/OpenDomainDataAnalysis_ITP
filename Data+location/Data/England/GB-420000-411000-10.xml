		<title>10KIRKBURTON RAPIER DANCERS</title>
		<content> The Kirkburton Dance dates from       
 1815. It used to be performed about   
 six times a year. The dance team      
 consists of 8 dancers and 4 musicians.
 They wear black trousers decorated    
 with ribbons, white shirts, dark      
 waistcoats, red neckerchief and clogs.
 The longsword  is about 1 metre long. 
 The dance is done by six people and   
 starts with a clash  of  swords. A    
 circle is then formed and the dancers 
 take  hold of the points of the other 
 swords. Different figures are         
 performed until the hand held sword   
 circle is broken by making a lock.This
 lock is Star of David of interwoven   
 swords.The dance from clash to  lock  
 is accompanied by music played on     
 recorder, drum and accordian.  Some   
 of the tunes used  are"Off She        
 Goes"and "Oyster Girl".
