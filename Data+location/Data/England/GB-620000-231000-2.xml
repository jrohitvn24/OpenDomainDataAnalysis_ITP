		<title>02PARKESTON QUAY</title>
		<content> There is no doubt that the port at    
 Parkeston is an important part of the 
{Transport}system of this country.At   
 the moment it is one of the busiest   
 ferry terminals in the country and    
 probably the world.It deals with a    
 huge amount of{tourist}trade, being an
 important departure point for travel  
 by car, or on foot for Denmark,The Low
 Countries, and Germany.               
 Even as we are doing our survey plans 
 were being announced to enlarge the   
 port to take even larger ships, and   
 more freight traffic.                 
 The main lines which sail are Sealink,
 D.F.D.S,and Olsen Lines.There is also 
 a large{Railway Station}at the Quay   
 which deals with a wide range of      
 traffic,quite a few passengers, but   
 also a lot of goods in transit to and 
 from the continent. It is the biggest 
 employer in the area.                 </content>
