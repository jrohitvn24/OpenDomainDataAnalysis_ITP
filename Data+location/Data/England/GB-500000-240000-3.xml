 must be taken out to stop the clay    
 cracking.  This is done by placing the
 bricks in chambers until all water has
 evaporated.                           
 4 Firing: clay bricks are fired in    
 kilns where the colour and texture are
 determined by the clay.               
 5 Packaging: the bricks are           
 hand-chosen and packed ready for      
 despatch.
