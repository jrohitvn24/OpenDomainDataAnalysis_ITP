 Beach all his life and is a well known
 resident,he leads an active life      
 farming and may often be seen         
 driving his old tractor on the roads _
 he uses it instead of a car, unable to
 take his wife on it but can't afford  
 any other form of transport he says!  
 He works on his 100 acre farm daily _ 
 says he won't retire. His farm has a  
 bungalow but he prefers to live in his
 bungalow in Severn Beach itself.      
 He's active in community life, a      
 member of Parish Council and Chairman 
 of Sandford and Gray Trust. He has    
 appeared in local pantomimes. He is a 
 mine of information.                  
 Severn Beach is mostly reclaimed land,
 tide used to come right over where    
 Severn Beach now is until sea wall was
 built between 1812 and 1815, by French
 Prisoners from the Napoleonic Wars.   </content>
