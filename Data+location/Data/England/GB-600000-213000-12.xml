		<title>12WEST MERSEA ROMAN TOMB.</title>
		<content> West Mersea's most famous Relic is the
 Barrow which stands near to the       
 Strood. Originally 60 feet in         
 diameter, this mound enlosed a        
 burial, which was Excavated by the    
 Essex Archaeological Society in       
 1912.They found a vault of red brick, 
 enclosing a lead casket measuring     
 about two cubic feet.This casket      
 contained a fine glass bowl,in which  
 were the cremated remains of an adult.
 These relics are now in Colchester    
 Museum. The superior quality of the   
 urn,together with the vastness of the 
 Barrow,indicates that the person      
 buried there was someone of           
 considerable wealth and standing.
