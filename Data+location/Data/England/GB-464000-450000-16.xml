		<content>    The Yorkshire Farm Machinery       
 Preservation Society were looking for 
 a site for their collection of 800    
 items of equipment. So with a grant of
 Â£90,000 the museum was established in 
 August 1980. The site chosen was an   
 open field site, adjacent to the York 
 Livestock Centre. It is close to York 
 the"Heart of Yorkshire",in the centre 
 of three old Ridings of Yorkshire.    
    The museum and surrounding land    
 covering 8 acres was opened 17th July 
 1982. It aims to attract 500 visitors 
 a day, its maximum attendance has been
 1,500.                                
    There are large items of farming   
 equipment on display as well as many  
 smaller items, displays of country    
 crafts including weaving and dry-stone
 walling to try, and a shop selling    
 craft work. There are also animals    
 for the children including 2 donkeys. </content>
