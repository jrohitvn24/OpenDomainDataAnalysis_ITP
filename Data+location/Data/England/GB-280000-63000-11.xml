		<content> We went to John to see what his job   
 was about.  As we went into the yard  
 we saw an employee putting a tyre on a
 tractor.  Then we saw two welding     
 machines with special goggles and     
 masks, and some H shaped girders which
 were cut in half ready for building a 
 steel barn.  His main job is welding  
 steel girder structures.  He showed us
 a sort of mangle which bent metal     
 bars.  He is also good at changing    
 uses for machines.  He likes his job  
 very much and he will do anything     
 possible with the tools he has.  His  
 hobby is cross-country on a motor     
 bike.  His hopes for the future are to
 carry on doing what he is doing at the
 moment.
