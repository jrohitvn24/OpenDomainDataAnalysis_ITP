		<title>02BELCHAMP ST. PAUL</title>
		<content>  {Belchamp St. Paul}is the main       
 village in the area. It's history can 
 be traced back at least to Norman     
 times;{Paul's Hall,}behind the church 
 occupies the site of the{Domesday     
 Manor.                                
   The name 'Belchamp' comes from      
 several sources. In saxon times it    
 meant 'a settlement on a hill',or a   
 'hamlet of belcs or cruck houses',and 
 after 1066 the normans continued to   
 call it Belchamp, meaning 'beautiful  
 fields'.{St.Pauls Cathedral, London,  
 owned land in the village and         
 eventually paid for the church to be  
 built and the village became known as 
 Belchamp St. Paul. The rights of the  
 cathedral have now passed to the      
 chapel at{Windsor Castle.             
   Some say that during the Dark and   
 Middle Ages the village was called    
 Baalchamp.                            </content>
