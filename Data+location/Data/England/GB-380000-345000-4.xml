		<title>04Keele-a university village</title>
		<content>Keele lies on the A525 between Madeley 
and Newcastle-Under-Lyme,and close to  
the M6 Motorway.                       
Most of the houses in the village were 
built before 1938, and a few were built
in the late 1800s.The build up of      
traffic on the A525 has proved to be a 
source of great danger and plans for a 
by-pass have been recently put forward.
An old yew tree stands in the centre of
the village at the junction of 2 roads.
Keele Hall,once the home of the Sneyd  
Family,is now part of the University of
Keele.There are large residential halls
for students,both here and in Keele    
village.The university population is   
very fluid with families moving after  
relatively short periods.The village   
population is fairly static consisting 
of families who have lived in Keele for
generations.
