		<title>01THE SURVEY AREA</title>
		<content> Our survey area includes the          
 settlements of Rampton,               
 Woodbeck,Treswell and part of South   
 Leverton.                             
    The children of Rampton Primary    
 School have compiled the survey       
 information.The children come from the
 villages mentioned, and also from the 
 settlements of Stokeham and Cottam.   
    Our survey area is very rural and  
 low lying in nature. The main local   
 industry is farming, but Rampton      
 Special Hospital and the Trentside    
 power stations employ many local      
 people.Farming in the area is mainly  
 arable.                               
    The region has good road links and 
 the nearest town of Retford is 6 miles
 away.Historic Lincoln is our nearest  
 city and is about 15 miles from this  
 area.
