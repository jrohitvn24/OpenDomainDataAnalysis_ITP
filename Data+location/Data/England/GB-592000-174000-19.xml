		<title>19Sheerness Canal</title>
		<content>       The{canal,}stretching from      
 Barton's Point to Queensway, was      
 originally built for defence during   
 the Napoleonic War. Today it is a     
 neglected area which has become       
 polluted with domestic waste.         
       On the banks the pollutants     
 include old tyres, milk crates,       
 plastic bottles and crisp packets.    
       In the canal itself there are   
 old prams, mattresses, tyres and a    
 profusion of plastic bags and         
 containers.                           
       As a result of tests with       
 Universal Indicator paper the water   
 was found to be PH 10 which shows a   
 high level of{pollution.              
       The result on the{ecology}has   
 been growth of weeds and little       
 variety of{insect life.}The stagnant  
 water is, however, a breeding ground  
 for gnats.                            </content>
