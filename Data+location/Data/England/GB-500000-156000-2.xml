 Pyrford Court was originally owned by 
 Lord and Lady Iveagh. It was built in 
 1904 by Lord Iveagh on land given to  
 him by his father-in-law, Lord Onslow.
 Later in the 1920's the west and east 
 wings were added. Lord Iveagh died in 
 1968 and Pyrford court was empty until
 1977. In 1978 Mr and Mrs Laikin bought
 the property. Pyrford Court has 20    
 acres of land and the gardens are     
 opened to the public twice a year.

 home employing 10 staff.

 homes, most permanently situated with 
 their own gardens and mains services.
