		<content> Many people are self-employed within  
 the area. Their skills range from     
 gloving to upholstery and cabinet     
 making. Local industry within our area
 encompasses picture framing, drainage 
 specialists, garage services, hotel   
 and pubs and furniture renovation.    
 Security patrolling, music lessons and
 jewellery making are also             
 represented. Country pursuits include 
 fishing, shooting and hunting. Many   
 competent riders and show jumpers live
 in the area, as well as working-dog   
 owners and handlers. Ferrets and      
 lurchers are also worked. The children
 all learn folk and country dancing,   
 and the boys also do Morris dancing.  
 The W.I. and W.R.V.S. are the focal   
 points for handicrafts and cooking.
