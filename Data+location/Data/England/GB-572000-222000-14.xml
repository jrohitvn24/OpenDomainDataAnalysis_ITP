		<title>14The Market in Braintree.</title>
		<content>    Braintree market in 1985 takes     
 place twice a week on Wednesdays and  
 Saturdays. It is mainly a fruit and   
 vegetable market with clothes stalls  
 and household items. It is held in    
 Market Square, extends through High   
 Street and into Bank Street.          
    The modern market is different from
 the one started nearly 800 years ago, 
 in 1199 with a charter from King John.
 Then the colourful stalls were packed 
 into Little Square.                   
    Through the years the number of    
 stalls multiplied until the market    
 was bursting at the seams and a new   
 market cross was errected in 1631 in  
 New Street.                           
    This moved once again to the       
 present site in 1826.                 
    The wool trade used this market and
 Braintree's population grew as a      
 result during this period.            </content>
