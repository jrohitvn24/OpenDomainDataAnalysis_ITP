		<title>01LONGDENDALE - A REVIEW</title>
		<content> The Longdendale Valley is situated on 
 the western side of the Peak National 
 Park. It is a mix of urban and rural  
 areas. The four villages making up the
 urban aspect are  Hollingworth,       
 Hadfield, Tintwistle and Padfield. The
 rural area is mainly grazing for      
 cattle and sheep in the valley while  
 above is rough pasture and moorland.  
 During the 19th Century many cotton   
 mills were built in the area and      
 during the 1870-1890 period there was 
 a population increase.                
   Now any mills that remain have been 
 converted to other uses mainly small  
 businesses.                           
   New housing developments have taken 
 place particularly in Hollingworth and
 Hadfield and there has been a large   
 population increase since the 1960s.
