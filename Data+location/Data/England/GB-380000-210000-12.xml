		<title>12A DAY IN THE LIFE OF JAMES</title>
		<content>  My name is James Johnson and I live  
 at Park End House. When my mum shouts 
 "Breakfast!", I slowly get up and get 
 washed and dressed. It is 8.45 and it 
 will soon be time for school. A short 
 trip in the car and we arrive at      
 school at five to nine. Soon the bell 
 goes and we get on with History till  
 playtime, when we have something to   
 eat. After play I do Maths and if we  
 finish before dinner we can draw a    
 picture. After dinner and a play we   
 have craftwork and then we have a     
 story. We go home at 3 o'clock.       
  When I get home I watch TV with a cup
 of coffee. My dad comes home in time  
 for tea. I give my dad a game of      
 badminton then I feed the guinea pigs 
 and play with my brother. I go to bed 
 and read a book before going to sleep.
 I am 8 years old.
