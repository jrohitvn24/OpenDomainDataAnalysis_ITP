		<content> South Brent, a village with about 2500
 people, is situated on the southern   
 edge of the Dartmoor National Park.   
 The western skyline is a ridge of     
 moorland over 350m high. To the NE,   
 Brent Hill rises to 300m in a distinc-
 tive escarpment visible from Bigbury  
 Bay, 10 miles away. "Brent" is from   
 the Anglo-Saxon, meaning "steep".     
 The River Avon, rising on Dartmoor and
 passing west of the village, once pow-
 ered 4 water mills. Manor Mill was    
 mentioned in the first Domesday Book. 
 In the study area there are over 20   
 farms and smallholdings. Narrow lanes 
 and high hedges are characteristic of 
 this area which draws many tourists.  
 The small hamlets of Aish, Didworthy, 
 Harbourneford, Lutton &amp; Stidston      
 surround S. Brent which was once their
 market town. It was also important in 
 connection with pack-horse transport. </content>
