		<title>03Fermyn Woods Hall</title>
		<content> Mrs. Maxwell (b 1919) inherited the   
 Hall from her father Capt Belville.   
 She has two children and twin         
 grandchildren aged 16 months. Her     
 father was in the army and her mother 
 was a nurse with Edith Cavell. The    
 Hall was purchased in 1925 and Mrs.   
 Maxwell hopes that her family, if they
 can afford it, will inherit it after  
 her. If not, then it will have to be  
 sold. Fermyn Hall covers 348 acres of 
 land and the fields are leased to     
 neighbouring farmers for grass        
 keeping. Her horses graze there in the
 summer and are used for hunting in the
{Woodland Pytchley Hunt.}For extra     
 revenue TV companies have used the    
 grounds for location shots for three  
 productions{The Sword Divided, Bleak  
{House and Jane Eyre. }The grounds are 
 loaned for the{Brigstock Horse Trials.
