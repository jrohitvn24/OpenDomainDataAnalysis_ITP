		<content> modern area with security             
 guards,bright yellow crane,modern     
 ships, to handle the nuclear          
 waste.British gas have a condensate   
 storage area.This is very modern.We   
 were not allowed in.There is one      
 railway line connecting BNFL to the   
 main line to Sellafield where the     
 waste nuclear fuel is processed.The   
 sea scouts have some sheds and boats  
 and use the docks for sailing on.     
 Outside the docks are large areas of  
 mud flats.The main channel is marked  
 with lighthouses,and big red and green
 buoys.There are lots of small sailing 
 boats and fishing boats in the        
 channel.We saw seven cargo boats tied 
 up.We did not see many people.
