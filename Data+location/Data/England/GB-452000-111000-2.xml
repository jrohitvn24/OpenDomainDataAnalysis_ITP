		<content>      The school was founded as a      
 National School in 1839.  It was built
 of yellow brick and had a slate roof. 
 In 1874 it became a Board School and a
 red brick extension was built with a  
 bell tower and bell on the new tiled  
 roof.  In recent years a kitchen and  
 two offices have been added as well as
 a temporary class room.  The outside  
 toilets have been demolished and      
 internal ones installed.              
      The school has 94 pupils and     
 four teachers, as well as two         
 non-teaching assistants, a secretary, 
 caretaker, cook, kitchen assistant and
 two supervisory assistants.  Many     
 parents help in the school on a       
 voluntary basis.                      
      Children start at the school in  
 the term in which they become five,   
 and move to Wildern Comprehensive     
 School, Hedge End at eleven plus.     </content>
