		<title>04The Wheel Craft Centre -2-</title>
		<content> The Mill and Craft Centre are owned by
 one person but each of the 16 craft   
 units is autononymous and operated by 
 the craftsperson in residence.  The   
 public has access all year round to   
 the crafts workshops and there is no  
 entrance fee.  A shop sells a         
 representative sample of the crafts   
 produced by the blacksmith, shoemaker,
 furniture-maker, silversmith,         
 stoneware potters, toymaker, ceramic  
 modeller, mobile maker, print and     
 textile designer, weaver, dress       
 designer and stained glass maker.  We 
 interviewed two Australian potters who
 have been in the craftsworkshop for a 
 year and plan to stay indefinitely.   
 They enjoy the opportunity to meet    
 the public in their workshop and are  
 pleased that the craft centre is on a 
 small scale and that they are able to 
 work in such a pleasant atmosphere.   </content>
