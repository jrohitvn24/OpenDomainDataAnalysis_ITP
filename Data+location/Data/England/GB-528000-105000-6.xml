		<content> I dashed down the road to the Seven   
 Dials hoping I wasn't going to miss my
 bus. I gazed around at the familiar   
 place. The cars were tooting and      
 hooting to each other, the people     
 bustled in and out of the shops. I    
 disappeared into a crowded sweet shop 
 to buy a 13p packet of crisps. I just 
 stopped myself from buying some       
 mallows for 1p each. I emerged and    
 turned to the road to tackle the      
 zebra_crossing. The 'little green man'
 started bleeping and I walked across  
 safely. Here the people were milling  
 about everywhere and I dodged in and  
 out, past the video shop, the baker'  
 and the optician's to reach the       
 bus_stop. The bus came, I climbed in  
 thankfully, paid my 15p fare and it   
 started to chug away.                 
                                       
                                       </content>
