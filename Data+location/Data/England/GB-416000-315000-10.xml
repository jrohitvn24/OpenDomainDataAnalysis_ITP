		<title>10Chocolate factory, Alrewas</title>
		<content>The Tudor chocolate factory is set back
from the road behind the Tudor Bread   
and Cake shop in Main Street.  It is a 
small flat roofed brick building       
painted white.  The factory is owned by
Mr. Burns-Mace Snr. and is managed by  
his son.  The business began 40 years  
ago behind the Tudor Cafe in Lichfield 
but moved to larger premises here in   
1975.  The chocolates are well known   
because they are hand made, high       
quality products.  The factory makes   
250 varieties.  There are filled       
chocolates, Easter eggs and the largest
range of figures in the country.       
Production of eggs begins in December. 
The largest weighs 20 lbs and takes 1  
hour to make.  The factory sells goods 
to all the top London stores, but does 
not export.  The workers are 12 women  
and boys.  They work 5 days a week,    
from 8 am. to 4.30 pm.                 </content>
