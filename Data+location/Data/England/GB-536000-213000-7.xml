		<title>07AMWELL QUARRY</title>
		<content>{Amwell Quarry }has been worked for    
 twelve years and has nearly 18 months 
 of digging left before all the stone  
 has been worked.All the working is    
 from below water.Large buckets        
 attached to cranes dig out up to 5    
 tons of stone at a time.This is taken 
 by conveyor to a grading tower where  
 different sized stones are kept to be 
 loaded onto lorries when needed.As all
 the working is under water the stone  
 does not need to be washed and this   
 makes the cost of working {Amwell     
{Quarry }slightly less than dry        
 quarries.                             
      The company working the quarry   
 has spent a great deal of time        
 restoring the land and turning it into
 a sanctuary for animals,birds,plants  
 and insects.Eventually they hope to   
 reintroduce otters onto this site.
