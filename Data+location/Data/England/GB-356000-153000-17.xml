		<content>    Some areas of the Mendips are      
 desolate and ghosts and legends of the
 supernatural are common.              
    In 1835 it was reported in a local 
 paper that the cottagers at Eaker Hill
 saw an "immense body of troops" fully 
 armed and in uniform.The cottagers    
 were deeply worried, imagining the    
 troops were a hostile force.          
    There are stories of the west door 
 of the church in Chewton Mendip       
 glowing a bright green and gusts of   
 wind blowing through the church when  
 there was no sign of wind outside.    
    The recent occupants of The Old    
 Rectory have seen and heard a ghost on
 four separate occasions and claim it  
 is a man that haunts their house.     
    In Litton a ghost is said to roam  
 on Shortwood Common.The ghost is      
 supposed to be a postman who was      
 murdered.                             </content>
