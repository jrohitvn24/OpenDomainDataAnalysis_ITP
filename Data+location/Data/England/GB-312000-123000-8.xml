		<content>      ON MAY 30th 1985 THERE WAS A FIRE
 IN THE TOP BARN, GRATEFUL COTTAGE,    
 MILVERTON, SOMERSET. THE FIRE WAS     
 STARTED BY A PAINT STRIPPER GUN. MY   
 MUM LEFT IT PLUGGED IN AND THE WIRE   
 WAS ROUND THE STARTING BUTTON.        
 SOMETHING JOGGED IT AND IT SWITCHED ON
 AND STARTED A FIRE. THE FIRE STARTED  
 AT NIGHT AND WAS SEEN IN THE          
 AFTERNOON.                            
                                       
      THERE WERE 2 FIRE ENGINES AND    
 12 FIRE MEN. THE WINDOWS,THE ROOF AND 
 THE FLOOR WERE BURNT. THE WALLS WERE  
 COVERED IN BLACK SMOKE. OUR FRIDGE WAS
 BURNT AND A BRAND NEW PLAN PRINTER    
 THAT WAS WORTH APPROXIMATELY Â£1,000.  
 THE FIRE STARTED AT APPROXIMATELY     
 2.00AM. AFTERWARDS, ONLY THE WALLS AND
 HALF THE FLOOR WERE LEFT.             
                                       
                                       </content>
