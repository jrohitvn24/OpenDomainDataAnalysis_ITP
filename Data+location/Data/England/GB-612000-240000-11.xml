		<title>11Where I live</title>
		<content>I live at 3 Didsbury Close and I asked 
my Dad why did you want to live here?  
He said he wanted to live near his     
work. The advantages of living here are
well designed houses, good road layout 
and nearness to shops and schools.  The
disadvantages are small gardens and the
area could be improved by more local   
jobs. A closer sports centre would     
improve the amenities in the area.     
You would describe the area as pleasant
with modern houses, shops and schools. 
I think the area is O.K. but there's   
not many places with trees to play in.
