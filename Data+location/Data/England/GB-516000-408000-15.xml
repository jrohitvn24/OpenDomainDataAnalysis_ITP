		<title>15KEELBY LIBRARY</title>
		<content> The village library opened in November
 1982.It used to be the school.Part of 
 the building is now used as the Youth 
 Club.The building is made of brick and
 has a slate roof.It was built in 1879.
 There are two ladies who work there   
 ,one park time and one full time.They 
 have also got one cleaner.The library 
 is open fourteen hours a week.About   
 two thousand people belong to the     
 library and there are about seven     
 thousand books.All the reference books
 are numbered.The subjects on which    
 they have most books are sport and    
 cookery.The greatest number of books  
 you can have is 6.If you are a child  
 and have an overdue book , you get a  
 card in the post telling you to bring 
 your library book back but if you get 
 out adults books and they are overdue 
 you must pay some money.It's good to  
 have a library in Keelby.             </content>
