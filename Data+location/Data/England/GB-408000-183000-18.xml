		<title>18Freshbrook School</title>
		<content> In contrast to Lydiard,Freshbrook was 
 completed in June 1981 at a cost of   
 Â£1 mill. A{staff of 19}looks after{529
{children}in 14 classrooms . As most of
 the children live within a mile of    
 the school on the whole they walk to  
 school there being no school bus.     
 The school is divided into 2 buildings
{The Birches and The Willows}both with 
 their own halls which are equipped    
 for use as{gyms}with wall bars ,      
 horses and ropes. Out side there is   
 a football pitch , a netball pitch  , 
 play grounds and{a garden}for the     
 children to grow things in.           
 The interior is spacious with many    
 pictures and flowers to give a        
 friendly atmosphere although the      
 tables appeared to be rather too small
 for the older children .The{school    
{uniform}is blue jumpers,red ties and  
 black trousers or skirts .            </content>
