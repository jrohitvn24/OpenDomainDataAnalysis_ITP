		<content> I like Newlyn because you can go      
 crabbing, all you need is a long piece
 of string and some bait.              
 The one disadvantage is the sea gulls 
 they always keep you awake at night.  
 There aren't many places to play.     
 But when my dad comes back from       
 unloading the Scillonian he has to    
 unload the lorry and Chrisy and I get 
 a ride on a fork lift truck.

 In Newlyn we have the fishmarket and  
 the harbour.                          
 I like the sea.                       
 We have a few shops a Co,op but not   
 a chemist.                            
 There are two bakerys Warrens and     
 Eddys.                                
 We have no clothes shops or things    
 like that, most of them are food      
 shops.Most people do their shopping in
 Penzance.                      Emma.  </content>
