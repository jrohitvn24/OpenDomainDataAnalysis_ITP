		<content>Lots of things have changed in         
Staverton.                             
Like when Mrs Webb first moved in there
were no street lights and she said it  
was creepy if you wanted to go         
somewhereat night .                    
Mr Warner from the Staverton Stores    
said that the number of young children 
has dropped and the number of older    
people has increased.                  
Mrs Webb from the Staverton Sub Post   
Office said that 40 to 60 people       
collect their old age pension and 20 to
30 collect their family allowance.     
The school numbers have got lower but  
now children from Catesby and Helidon  
come to the school.                    
In Staverton there used to be three    
shops but now there is only one.There  
used to be two pubs but now there is   
one.
