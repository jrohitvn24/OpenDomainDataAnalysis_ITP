		<title>13Children's Playground Games.</title>
		<content> These are some of the games which were
 seen at playtime in July 1985.        
{Bulldog}A player stands in the centre 
 of an imaginary pitch.When he shouts  
 "Bulldog"the rest of the players on   
 one side of the pitch run to the other
 side.The ones who are caught are "on".
{Scarecrow Tig}It is just like ordinary
 tig but when the person "on" tigs     
 someone,they have to stand like a     
 scarecrow.They are free when another  
 player crawls through their legs.     
{Hop Scotch}There are 8 squares and in 
 order you throw a stone onto the      
 numbered squares.You then hop into    
 each square apart from the one with   
 the stone, up to number 8 then on your
 way back pick up the stone.You are out
 if the stone you throw doesn't go in  
 the correct square or if you stand on 
 a line.                               
                                       </content>
