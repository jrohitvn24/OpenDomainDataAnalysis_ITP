		<title>19TRADE:WOODTON AREA</title>
		<content> This block includes much open country-
 side &amp; relatively few houses so it is 
 not surprising to find that apart from
 farming &amp; a stud farm,breeding Welsh  
 ponies,there are few other businesses.
 The Woodton garage on the main Norwich
 -Bungay road has the agency for       
 Peugeot &amp; Talbot cars for this part   
 of Norfolk &amp; nearby Suffolk;it also   
 sells petrol &amp; diesel fuels.Apart from
 the 4 members of the family,it employs
 3 other people,who together provide   
 sales,servicing &amp; repairs for these 2 
 makes of car.                         
 The nursery in Woodton is another     
 family business.It has about 7000     
 sq.yards of greenhouses producing     
 lettuce in the winter &amp; about 7000lbs 
 tomatoes per week as well as cucumbers
 in the summer.All this is managed by  
 the 2 owners &amp; a part-time lady.
