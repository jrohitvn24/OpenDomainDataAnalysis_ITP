		<content> In about five minutes time Angela, Tom
 and Abigail came.  We all went out to 
 catch the{bus.} Ten minutes later the 
 bus came and I sat in the back.       
                                       
 When we got to the second stop a girl 
 called Kirsty came on.  She was coming
 to Symondsbury School also because she
 is on{Work Experience.}We arrived at  
 School at 8.35am.  I just walked      
 around the playground until it was    
 time to go in.                        
                                       
 When we got in we had the register.   
 Mr.Mahoney told us to stand.  We had  
 Assembly.  We sang a hymn and had a   
 prayer.  When Assembly was over we all
 sat down and Mr.Mahoney said that we  
 would have spellings.
