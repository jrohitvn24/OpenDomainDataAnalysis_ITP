		<content>  "A very pleasant and charming area,  
 with beautiful walks, lovely country- 
 side and friendly people."            
                                       
  "Some members of our family have     
 lived here for several generations."  
                                       
  "Superb villages in delightful       
 surroundings. The removal of colliery 
 waste and restoration of their areas  
 has been superbly done. Vandalism is  
 very rare and then due to incomers."  
                                       
  "A most interesting place to live and
 an area obviously ripe for development
 as can be seen from the burgeoning    
 private development of Prior's Grange,
 and the possibility of an 'up-market' 
 hotel being created out of the manor  
 house. This is obviously the up and   
 coming place to live, full of history 
 with a landscape unmatched in Durham."</content>
