		<title>13RECREATION IN AMBLE</title>
		<content> The root of{Amble's recreational      
 activities is the hard-working, hard- 
 drinking,{male-dominated society}of   
 the{nineteenth century. The men}who   
 helped{to export the coal and fished  
 from the port{worked hard}and         
 established{a working-class community.
 The{public houses and churches}were   
 the focal point of society.{Warkworth 
 meanwhile retained its more           
{traditional character,}while{Amble}in 
 the{second half of the 20th century   
 saw a{greater involvement of women}in 
 the{social activities of the town.}The
 movement towards{physical fitness in  
{the 1980s}has seen an interest in     
{outdoor and physical pursuits.}The    
 town is looking towards{recreation}as 
{a source of income}with the decline of
 the traditional industries.{Tourism}is
 growing, with{a caravan site}already  
 established and a{proposed marina.    </content>
