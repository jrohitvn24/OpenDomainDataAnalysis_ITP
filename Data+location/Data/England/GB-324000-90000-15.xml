		<title>15A Day With a Fisherman cntd</title>
		<content>    At 2.40pm the trawl was brought in 
 for the last time,we then headed back 
 towards Seaton to go crab potting. The
 trawl had caught Plaice,Whiting,Dog   
 Fish,Dover Sole,Skate,crabs,squids,   
 lobsters and Stinkers.                
    At 3.45pm we reached the first crab
 pot and for the next two hours we     
 gathered up 30 crab pots from the sea 
 out of which he took 27 crabs but he  
 put about 40 crabs back into the sea  
 because they were too small or too    
 soft. The crabs Mr.Ziemann keeps are  
 exported to France and Spain, the fish
 he catches are sold in Seaton.        
    Mr.Ziemann has been a fisherman for
 about 8 years and fishes 12 hours a   
 day most of the year.                 
    We got back into harbour at Axmouth
 very wet and tired at 6.45pm after a  
 very enjoyable day which we will never
 forget.                               </content>
