		<title>03POLLUTION COVENTRY S.W.</title>
		<content> At the centre of{Whitley Abbey}school 
 there is a lake.In 1983 it was        
 polluted after vandals burst an oil   
 pipe.All of the fish in the lake      
 died.Volunteers helped by Coventry    
 Junior Chamber,the L.E.A.and          
 professional contractors cleared the  
 lake.Now there are wildfowl nesting   
 in the reeds.They have put in roach   
 and carp.If you want a fishing permit,
 see the caretaker.The lake is         
 beautiful again.                      
 The{pumping station}in Whitley has    
 been out of action because of         
 contamination.Scientists are trying to
 trace the source of the pollution. It 
 may have been caused by the illegal   
 dumping of chemical waste,which is a  
 common problem in many parts of the   
 country today.
