  It is said that Shirebrook has been  
 on the map since the stone-age but its
 present prosperity is due to the coal 
 industry. The pit was sunk at the end 
 of the last century, and , because it 
 seemed to be in the middle of nowhere,
 a complete mining village had to be   
 built. Rows of terraced back-to-back  
 houses were erected. A major          
 redevelopment over the past few years 
 has seen the disappearance of many of 
 these houses with pleasant, open      
 estates replacing them.               
  The people of Shirebrook belong to a 
 very warm-hearted, close-knit         
 community. Most locals are born,      
 brought up and will die within the    
 boundaries of Shirebrook.
