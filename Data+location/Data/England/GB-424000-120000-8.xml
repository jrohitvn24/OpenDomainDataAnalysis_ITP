		<title>08Map making in Landford</title>
		<content> Landford Manor is used today by a     
 company that makes maps and plans.They
 make their maps from aerial           
 photographs taken from the company's  
 Piper Seneca aircraft.The special     
 camera takes overlapping pictures of  
 the area to be mapped, and labels     
 them. The pictures are turned into    
 diapositives, which look like         
 negatives but are the right way round.
 Two of these are put into a drawing   
 machine which shows the operator a 3D 
 view of the area. He traces round     
 allthe features with a pointer and    
 they are drawn onto a piece of plastic
 which will not stretch or shrink like 
 paper. Information about heights and  
 lines is fed into the computer, and   
 then the maps are printed off. They   
 are mostly large scale maps for new   
 roads, waste disposal sites, or       
 buildings in towns.                   </content>
