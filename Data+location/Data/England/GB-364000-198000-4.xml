		<title>04BERKELEY VALE DAIRY FARMING</title>
		<content>{Dairy farming}around Berkeley Power   
 Station was very wide spread in the   
 past, but in the spring of 1983 the   
{quota}system was brought in allowing  
 the farmer to produce only a certain  
 amount of{milk.}The amount that he    
 could produce was based on his        
 previous years production. If the year
 before was a particularly bad year for
 the farmer then he had to just accept 
 the terms. This did in fact mean that 
 many of the local farmers had to      
{reduce}the size of their herds.       
 Were the quotas realy needed? We were 
 not producing enough milk for our own 
 use, it was just that milk production 
 in{Europe}was too high. In fact we    
 import milk to make up the reqiured   
 amounts for this country.             
 Increased costs of{feed concentrates  
 have also meant farmers have had to   
 cut back                              </content>
