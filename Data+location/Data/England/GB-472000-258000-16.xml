		<title>16THE MISS NASH INTERVIEW</title>
		<content>We visited Miss Nash,late Headmistress 
of Spencer Girl's School,who has lived 
in the St.James area all her life.She  
told us that she had seen very many    
changes take place.She told us that at 
one time there were no buses only trams
into the town centre,and you could get 
there more quickly than you can today. 
The area used to have an Ice Rink,which
later became one of the town's nine    
cinemas-we now haveÂ£one'triple cinema  
only.People in those days seemed more  
friendly and had time for each other-it
was much more of a community, centered 
around the local church,chapel,school, 
and shoe factory.On hot summer evenings
people used to sit outside and chat to 
each other the streets were safe for   
children to play in while parents could
keep an eye on them.Now there is only  
one shoe factory,hardly anyone goes to 
church,and people lock their doors.    </content>
