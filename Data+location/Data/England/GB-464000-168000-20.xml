		<title>20LIFESTYLES - BURGHFIELD</title>
		<content> The name of the person we interviewed 
 was Mrs. Lambourne.  Her address is   
 in Kingshill.                         
 She used to be in the war as a WAAF   
 then she was a hairdresser but now she
 is a housewife.  Her husband was an   
 ROF Fire Officer and he is now retired
 and she has been living in Burghfield 
 for sixty-two and a half years.  Her  
 hobbies are walking, knitting, theatre
 and looking after children.  She shops
 at Savacentre and Waitrose (Meadway). 
 She does not use public transport very
 often.  She likes the area a lot.  She
 thinks it is a good place for a       
 family.  She thinks the Berkshire     
 County Council should keep the hedges,
 verges and roads in better condition. 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
