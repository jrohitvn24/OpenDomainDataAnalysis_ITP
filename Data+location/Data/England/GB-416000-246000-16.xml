		<content>   I'm a girl. I'm 11 years old with   
 brown hair and blue eyes.             
   My hobbies are pop music, cats,     
 writing and dancing. My favourite     
 subject at school is English.         
   My Mum and Dad both have black      
 hair. Dad's a motor mechanic at the   
 village garage. He mends anything from
 lawnmowers to lorries.                
   My Mum and Dad both enjoy working in
 the garden and Mum also does sewing.  
 She likes the Women's Institute and is
 a bell ringer at church . My brother  
 and I are learning to ring as well.   
   My sister is handicapped. She       
 collects teddy bears and likes        
 to play with plasticine and straws.   
   My brother is 13. He likes motor    
 bikes and rugby. He has blue eyes and 
 brown hair.
