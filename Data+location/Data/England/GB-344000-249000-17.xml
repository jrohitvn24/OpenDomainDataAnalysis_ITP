		<content> The children at school have lots of   
{pets_ponies,dogs,cats,rabbits,budgies,
{hamsters,guinea-pigs and gold-fish.   
 There are always dogs and cats on the 
 farms.June's pony, Snowy, is 12 hands 
 high.One day she caught her in the    
 field with a handful of pony-nuts.She 
 groomed her with a dandy-brush and a  
 curry-comb to get all the loose hair  
 and dust out of her coat.She put a rug
 and then the saddle on her back and   
 the bridle over her head.After a ride 
 in the woods, enjoying bluebells and  
 other wild flowers, June groomed Snowy
 again and put her in her stable.June  
 also lets other children ride Snowy   
 at events organised by the School     
 Parents Organisation.At one such      
 event, an Exemption Dog Show, Kirsty  
 won a prize for the dog with the      
 waggiest tail. Richard's dog won a    
 prize at Crufts.                      </content>
