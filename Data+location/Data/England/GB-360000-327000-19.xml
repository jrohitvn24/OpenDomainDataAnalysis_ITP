		<title>19GROUP DWELLINGS - HODNET</title>
		<content> In Hodnet there is a{Group Dwelling   
 for{elderly people,}in Station Road,  
 called{"The Meadows" }There are       
 16 bungalows.  The people who live in 
 them are:-      Mr/Mrs Davies &amp; family
 (Warden). Miss Shaw, Mr/Mrs. Osborne, 
 Mrs Jones, Mrs Owen, Mrs Rapley,

 Mrs.Green,Mr Jones, Mrs Partington &amp;  
 Miss Pierce. Mrs Davies looks after   
 the people, she is a{warden.}   North 
 Shropshire District Council, built the
 community. There is a quarry under our
 house the rest of the land belongs to 
 the council. Just opposite, in Station
 Road, is the Post Office.             
 I think that the community was built  
 in 1982.                              
 We have lived here for nearly 2 years.
