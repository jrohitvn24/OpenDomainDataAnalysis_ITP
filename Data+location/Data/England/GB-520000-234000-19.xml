		<title>19The Grange Estate</title>
		<content> Ebenezer Howard planned his Garden    
 City to be self-contained with each   
 house having its own garden, wide tree
 lined streets and surrounded by farm  
 land. This lasted until after the 2nd 
 World War, when the first of the      
 Estates were built on the farm land at
 the edge of the town.  This was       
 started in 1948 and when the Grange   
 School was opened in 1951 it was a    
 well developed estate with many houses
 occupied.                             
 Now in 1985, the Grange Estate is the 
 oldest, best established of the four  
 estates ringing the town - a          
 population of about 8,OOO - largely   
 people buying what were previously    
 council houses. It has a parade of    
 shops, a community centre, a pub and  
 two schools.There is an aging         
 population on the Grange nowadays, and
 that will be a problem in the future. </content>
