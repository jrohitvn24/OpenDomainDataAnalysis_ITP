		<title>14THE FARMS COMPARED</title>
		<content>  Vineyards farm has 240 acres and     
 Pegglesworth has 800. The owner of    
 Vineyards farm is a family with two   
 children whereas Pegglesworth is owned
 by a millionaire! Vineyards farm      
 grows grass, wheat and spring barley  
 to make beer but is mainly a sheep    
 farm.  Pegglesworth grows peas, barley
 and corn and has some woods and       
 grazing fields.                       
  In 1980 the family at Vineyards built
 their own house (they could not afford
 to buy the old farmhouse with the     
 land). Pegglesworth was bought in a   
 number of seperate lots  and is farmed
 by a farm manager.                    
  Both farms have their own electricity
 and water supplies. Pegglesworth has  
 more equipment and overall is best    
 off. The manager never looks at the   
 farm as his home but the owner of     
 Vineyards enjoys his work at his home.</content>
