		<content> A survey was taken on the A12. The    
 traffic is heavy on the by pass. On   
 the bank holiday weekend there were 22
 coaches westbound in one hour as      
 against 3 in the middle of the week.  
 We also counted an average of l387    
 cars in 2 separate hour long traffic  
 surveys taken over 2 days. There were 
 about 300 lorries on each day. The    
 traffic was very heavy. Drivers of    
 lorries travelled a high speed and    
 often too close together. The overall 
 impression is that the driving was not
 of a high standard especially         
 considering one day was wet.          
  Most of the traffic on the A128 is   
 greatest on Friday. There are 200 cars
 per day, few buses or lorries and even
 fewer articulated lorries.
