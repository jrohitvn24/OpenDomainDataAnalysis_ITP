 weekly. The Post Office (and village  
 store) is centrally placed and under- 
 takes all main services.

 Privately held - Practically every    
 household is connected; some lines are
 shared. The Exchange is in Salisbury  
 since this year. Ugly overhead lines  
 cross gardens; posts are randomly     
 placed; sound reception is sometimes  
 deplorablke; in places lines are      
 draped over fences.                   
 Public call boxes are 2 locations,in  
 the north of the village (often used  
 by lorry drivers) and in the centre   
 near a block of 4 Council Houses.     </content>
