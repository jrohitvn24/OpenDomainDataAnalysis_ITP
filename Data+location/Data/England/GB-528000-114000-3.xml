		<content>  We{interviewed}some members to see   
 what they thought of the centre. They 
 all enjoy it very much. The reason is 
 that they get bored and lonely on     
 their own. They like having people to 
 talk to.                              
  Most pensioners go to the centre     
 on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday     
 because they get hot meals. Most of   
 the people live near the centre. Those
 who don't, get voluntary drivers to   
 take them to the centre. Many of the  
 pensioners started coming because     
 relitives had died and they were      
{lonely.}Visiting the centre added joy}
 and excitement to their lives.
