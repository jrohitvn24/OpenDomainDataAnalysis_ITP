		<title>06A FARMER'S WIFE IN PLAISH</title>
		<content>    I have now been a farmer's wife for
 4 years. Living in a large rented     
 house (old enough to be in the        
 original Domesday Book) with a small  
 child, means long hours and sometimes 
 difficult times. With all the modern  
 appliances of today the everyday      
 chores are made a lot easier, but     
 there is still a great deal to do. I  
 am constantly decorating, as this     
 lovely old house has not been touched 
 for over 20 years. As mentioned, it is
 rented, so as well as battling single-
 handed with wet and dry rot, I am also
 battling with the Landlord, the       
 hardest battle of all.                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
