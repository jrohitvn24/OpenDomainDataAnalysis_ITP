		<title>15MALVERN HILLS CONSERVATORS</title>
		<content> Recently much work has been done      
 hauling marl and soil to re-establish 
 grass on the ridge of the Hills where 
 thousands of visitors have caused     
{erosion of the soil.}The ancient      
 Third's Wood has been extended and a  
{plantation}established to commemorate 
 the Queen's Silver Jubilee. Several   
 beech trees have been planted along   
 Jubilee Drive near the mature beech at
 Brand's Lodge.{Fire breaks and access 
{paths}have been created and all road  
 and path{verges are mown}to minimise  
 the fire risk. On Herefordshire Beacon
{tarmac paths}with Malvern stone edging
 and steps made from the local stone   
 have encouraged visitors to keep off  
 the{ramparts of the Iron Age Fort.}The
 ramparts are now restored. The revenue
 for{landscape conservation}comes from 
 a precept on local ratepayers and     
 partly from car parking fees.         </content>
