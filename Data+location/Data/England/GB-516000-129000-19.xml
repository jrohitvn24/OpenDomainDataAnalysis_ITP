		<content> 63 people were surveyed. 84% chose the
 West Sussex County Times as the most  
 popular newspaper followed by the     
 Horsham Advertiser, Evening Argus and 
 the Gazette. 76% thought that their   
 paper was truthful, 97% thought it was
 good value for money. The news pages  
 were the most popular, but only 6%    
 read the situations vacant. 54% of the
 respondents listen to local radio,    
 Radio Mercury being the most popular. 
 How ever listening time was only      
 half hr or less per day with the      
 morning being the most popular time.  
 Other stations listened to were County
 Sound and Radio Sussex. The most      
 popular regional T.V news program was 
 Coast to Coast and 80% considered that
 local news coverage on T.V was good.  
 The main cause for complaint was that 
 the programs were boring or biased.
