		<title>18Telephones in Hundred Acre.</title>
		<content> We asked our class of 30, who all have
 telephones, if they had got a         
 push-button telephone. Only 5 of them 
 had got one, all the rest have dial   
 telephones. The telephone boxes are   
 red in Streetly. It is l0p. for about 
 3 minutes and after 6 p.m. you have   
 about 5 minutes for 10p. When we      
 telephone our friends we cannot see   
 each other. When we ring 999 an       
 operater  answers and says "What do   
 you require, Police, Ambulance or Fire
 Brigade?" and we tell her who we want 
 then she telephones them up and they  
 come as quickly as they can.
