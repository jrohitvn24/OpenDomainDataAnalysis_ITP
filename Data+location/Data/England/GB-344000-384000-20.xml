		<title>20Halewood - Area of Contrast.</title>
		<content>     When the two schools undertaking  
 this survey got together we found that
 there were startling contrasts in the 
 township of Halewood. The area was    
 found to be divided into two vastly   
 differing social areas. To the north  
 of the railway the residential areas  
 were settled and life was "normal". To
 the south of the railway there were   
 found to be many difficulties, these  
 being extremely high unemployment, a  
 very large proportion of single parent
 families, much vandalism, litter      
 strewn roads and a fairly high crime  
 rate. The schools also have a high    
 incidence of vandalism and forced     
 entry.                                
                                       
     All the work for this survey was  
 conducted by the children and staff of
 Roseheath and the Church of England   
 Schools, Halewood.                    </content>
