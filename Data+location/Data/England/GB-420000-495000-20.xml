		<content> The landscape is constantly changing  
 with the seasons giving the           
 countryside a different appearance as 
 the year progresses. Being a farming  
 area the view changes as the soil is  
 first ploughed to a rich brown then a 
 coat of green appears as the newly    
 planted seeds ripen and grow. Grass   
 becomes a lush green, the oil seed    
 rape turns a field into a blaze of    
 yellow and the gold of the corn fields
 , of the oats, barley and wheat, makes
 a colourful carpet over the land. The 
 trees also change over the seasons,   
 from the pale green shades of spring  
 to the autumn browns. Springtime is   
 spectacular, with the blossom of the  
 cherry and almond trees producing a   
 pink froth. The crocuses and the      
 daffodils growing along by the beck   
 complement natures beauty.
