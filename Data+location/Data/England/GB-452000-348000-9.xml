		<title>09A CHILD'S DAY</title>
		<content> A typical day in my life starts with  
 my Mum waking me up at 7.50 with a    
 welcoming cup of tea and a kiss.      
  I get up wash,dress and have breakfas
 t(toast and cereal).                  
 .At 8.30 I pack my bag and walk       
 to{school}meeting friends on the way. 
 I arrive at school at about 8.40 and  
 play stringy which is a game where    
 somebody is on and every time he/she  
 tags someone they hold hands. 9 AM the
 whistle blows and after assembly we st
 art working until dinner time which is
 12.00. I go home for lunch but most   
 of my friends stay. At 1.15 the       
 whistle blows and today it's topic day
 and I can work with my best friend    
 Lorna.The day ends at 3.45. After tea 
 I practise my piano and as it's Monday
 I go to{Swimming Club.}By 9.30 I am at
 home and after supper I go to bed.
