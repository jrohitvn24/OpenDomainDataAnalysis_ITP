 A MOTHER AND TODDLER GROUP MEETS HERE 
 EVERY WEDNESDAY FOR 1\ HRS.  THE      
 MOTHERS LOOK AFTER THEIR OWN CHILDREN 
 AND TAKE TURNS AT OPENING UP THE HALL 
 AND BEING IN CHARGE.  THE MOTHERS EACH
 BRING A TOY FOR THE CHILDREN TO RIDE  
 ON.  THEY COME FROM NEWNHAM,          
 ROCHFORD,TENBURY AND EASTHAM. EACH    
 MOTHER PAYS 5OP A WEEK.  THE          
 ORGANISERS PAY Â£3.OO FOR THE HALL. THE
 CHILDREN GET SQUASH AND A BISCUIT AND 
 THE MOTHERS GET COFFEE. WE SAW THE    
 TODDLERS RIDING TRICYCLES AND PLAYING 
 WITH TEDDIES,TRACTORS AND A TELEPHONE.
 WE TALKED TO MRS CULLEN WHO WAS IN    
 CHARGE THAT DAY.  SHE SAID THE GROUP  
 STARTED IN JANUARY 1985.
