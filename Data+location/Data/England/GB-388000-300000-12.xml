		<title>12ST.MICHAEL'S CHURCH</title>
		<content>There has been a church on the site of 
St.Michael's and All Angels',Tettenhall
for over 1000 years.The huge,old yew   
trees in the churchyard are perhaps the
only remains of the first church.The   
tower is about 600 years old but the   
main part of the church is only 30     
years old.The church had to be rebuilt 
after a fire in 1950.The church opened 
again in 1955.In 1985 the sanctuary was
changed.The altar has been placed in   
the centre of the sanctuary.           
The churchyard has many old graves but 
work is going on,flattening the stones,
laying grass for easy maintenance.     
The church has a staff of 6 people led 
by the Rector.Every Sunday there is a  
Family Communion Service.Men,boys and  
girls sing in the choirs.There are     
special services at Christmas and      
Easter.There are about 100 weddings,80 
funerals and 80 christenings each year.</content>
