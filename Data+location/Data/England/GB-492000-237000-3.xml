		<content> The world outside is vital to the     
 community as there is no post office, 
 the nearest being at Woburn Sands or  
 Cranfield both three miles away from  
 the village.The majority of residents 
 have telephones in their homes and    
 there is a kiosk in Salford and in the
 district of Lower End. British Telecom
 issue a guide on how to obtain the    
 best service. Information is also     
 obtainable on subjects such as        
 telephone numbers, the weather, travel
 news, correct time, recipes and       
 entertainment. Postal Services are    
 important and consist of two          
 collections and deliveries Monday to  
 Friday and one collection and delivery
 on Saturdays. Television gives world  
 and national news several times daily 
 keeping everyone up to date even in   
 the most isolated and lonely places.
