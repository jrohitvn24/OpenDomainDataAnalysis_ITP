		<title>19The Pury End Carpenter</title>
		<content>                                       
The village carpenter's name is        
Leonard Goff and he lives at 54 Careys 
Road in Pury End.  His main interests  
are cycling, painting and driving his  
1933 MG.  He discovered the MG in      
Somerset in 1982 and restored it       
himself.  He usually paints about six  
water colours a year.                  
                                       
As well as being a carpenter he        
restores antiques.  The oldest piece   
of furniture he has restored dates     
from the 17th century.  He gets his    
wood from Norwich and Brixworth.  He   
thinks the most useful handtool is the 
tenon saw and the most useful electric 
tool is the circular saw.
