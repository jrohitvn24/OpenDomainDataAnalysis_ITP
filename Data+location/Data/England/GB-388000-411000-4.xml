          Rochdale was renowned for its
 cotton industry but this has seriosly 
 declined;approx. 5,000 being employed 
 in 1985, which is 25% of the total    
 employed 15 years ago. However,       
 textiles still provide the main source
 of employment. Fothergill &amp; Harvey are
 the largest employer-approx. 600 -    
 manufacture synthetic fibres, with 70 
 to 80% of its out-put going to the    
 Ministry of Defence. Several light    
 engineering firms exist in the        
 area,eg. Reynolds, Taylors, Ratcliffes
 etc.                                  
   Unfortunately,Rochdale has one of   
 the worst employment figures in the   
 Greater Manchester Region;second only 
 to Wigan and St Helens.On the 19th    
 June 1985,the town's unemployment rate
 was 17.6% of the total work force,    
 which amounts to 10,727.              </content>
