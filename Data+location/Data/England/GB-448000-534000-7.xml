		<title>07LEARNING TO DANCE.</title>
		<content> My dancing started at 6pm and finished
 at 7pm.I wore a blue leotard with a   
 frill at the bottom, some pink leather
 shoes for ballet, and white leather   
 shoes with metal taps.One teacher is  
 called Mrs Whitelock the other Mrs    
 Foreman. After two years at the       
 community centre she asked me to move 
 to Old Hartlepool which is about one  
 mile South East of us. It is much     
 bigger there. In my first show I was  
 in 8 dances which was quite a lot.To  
 be a good dancer you must not let your
 legs tighten up or you will not be    
 able to kick your height. Doing the   
 splits every day helps you to have    
 good kicks too. I have been dancing   
 now for 5 years. In June I have a     
 Royal Academy of Dance exam. I hope to
 get an Honours pass which is the      
 highest mark.
