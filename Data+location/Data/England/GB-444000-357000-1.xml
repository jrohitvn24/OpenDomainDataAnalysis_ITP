		<title>01SUMMARY OF HUTHWAITE</title>
		<content> Huthwaite is an ancient settlement on 
 the Nottinghamshire-Derbyshire border.
 It is situated 2 miles west of        
 Sutton-in-Ashfield and 5 miles  west  
 of Mansfield. Herod's Hill,arguably   
 the highest point in Nottinghamshire, 
 is to be found here.                  
                                       
 Blackwell is the other settlement in  
 the block. Situated over the county   
 boundary, in Derbyshire, it occupies  
 an extensive area.                    
                                       
 The major industry until recently was 
 that of coal mining. Now these mines  
 have been exhausted.                  
 Clothing factories are predominant now
 along with an inland customs depot.   
                                       
 The M1 motorway runs through the area.
