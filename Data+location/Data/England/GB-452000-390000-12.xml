		<title>12A Child's Day in Maltby</title>
		<content> I get up at 7am. I go into the        
 bathroom and wash myself and clean my 
 teeth, then I get dressed. At 7.25am I
 go downstairs and watch T.V. before   
 having a breakfast of krunchy nut     
 cornflakes. After getting my things   
 ready, I set off for school at 8.15. I
 play football or tiggy ball with my   
 friends before school starts. At 9am  
 we have register and then do work such
 as number or writing. We have dinner  
 at 12 noon. We have a choice of menu. 
 When dinner play ends we go swimming, 
 getting back for playtime which lasts 
 fifteen minutes. After play we do more
 work until home time at 3.45pm. I     
 normally go to Richard's to play      
 before going to Karate club at 6.45pm.
 I get home at 8.20pm then I usually   
 watch television before going to bed  
 at 9.30pm.
