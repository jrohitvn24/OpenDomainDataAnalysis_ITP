		<title>05Church life in Lydlinch</title>
		<content>   Enter the decorative,iron gates of  
 the churchyard which,when closed form 
 a cross and walk up through an avenue 
 of pollarded plane trees to reach the 
 church.                               
   The church in Lydlinch is dedicated 
 to St.Thomas a Beckett.It was probably
 during the first flush of enthusiasm  
 for this saint (murdered in December  
 1170)that the church here was         
 founded.The first recorded Rector was 
 one Henry Haddon in 1303.The present  
 building was erected in 1479 with the 
 two-bay north arcade and vestry being 
 added in 1838.                        
   The parish no longer has its own    
 rector.Because of the national        
 shortage of clergy,about 10 years ago 
 it was put into the care of the Vicar 
 of Sturminster Newton who is also     
 responsible for the churches at Stock 
 and Kings Stag.                       </content>
