		<content>Kent Music School (KMS) started in     
Maidstone about 1953.  In September    
1981 a centre was started at Sevenoaks 
County Primary School.  It was put     
together by several teachers and then  
built up.  By 1985 it had 152 pupils,  
14 teachers and 12 instruments were    
taught.  There are two orchestras and a
wind band.                             
A lesson at the centre costs around 27 
pounds per term for a child and 46     
pounds for an adult. Instrument hire   
costs 6 pounds per term. Music exams   
for grades 1-8 cost from 2 to 16       
pounds.                                
As well as the 152 pupils that have    
regular lessons there are also over 200
who attend the many workshops held at  
the centre.  In Kent there are 12 other
centres but only 3 are based in        
schools.
