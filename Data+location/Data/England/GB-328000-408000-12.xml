		<content> THE ALDER WOODS There are surprisingly
 few alders. We saw Scots Pine, Balsam 
 Poplar, Pussy Willow, Corsican Pine,  
 Silver Birch, Common Hawthorn and     
 Alder. Most of the hawthorn trees only
 reached the waist of our teacher. In a
 dark part of the wood, bats were      
 flying about. One hung upside-down on 
 a pine tree. Opposite was a robin's   
 nest, burrowed in the sand on a grassy
 mound. In the nest were eggs and the  
 bird flew out in our faces.           
 THE PINE WOODS From 1914, Corsican    
 pines have been planted on the land-  
 ward side of the stabilised dunes.    
 The trees were planted close together 
 for commercial reasons but the plant- 
 ations have since spread naturally due
 to trees re-seeding themselves. Gold- 
 crests and red squirrels live here and
 many types of fungi, including puff-  
 balls, grow in the shade of the trees.</content>
