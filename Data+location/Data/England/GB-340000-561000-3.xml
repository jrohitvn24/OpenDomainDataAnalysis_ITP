		<content>  Most of the cottages are of stone and
 slate,or even a clay and stone        
 mixture.The oldest have thick walls   
 and small windows and doors.Old stone 
 barns often have stone steps to a door
 on the first floor.                   
  Some farmhouses are large.Some are   
 the castles(peel towers)built in olden
 times to protect the household, live- 
 stock and crops from raiders. Other   
 farmhouses were built more recently   
 than the stone cottages, when the area
 was becoming more prosperous.         
  Most farms now have both old and new 
 dwellings and farm buildings. They    
 have been built up during centuries,  
 often round a central yard. The old   
 and the new are well-matched, and some
 past owners have included decorative  
 roofs, chimneys and birdlofts in their
 developments to enhance the           
 appearance.                           </content>
