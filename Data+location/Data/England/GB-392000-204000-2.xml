		<title>02ROOKWOODS, WATERLANE.</title>
		<content>{Rookwoods}is a fine well kept{17th    
{century}gabled house on the western   
 side of the valley of the Holy Brook. 
 It is built of Cotswold stone,with a  
 stone tile roof.Two extensions,of     
 similar building style and materials  
 have been added in the last 40 years. 
 Documents record a house called       
{'Rockwude'}on this site as early as   
{1190,}this was probably part of a     
{medieval farm.}The present house was  
 once a barn.Inside there is a celler  
 and several big open fireplaces and   
 lots of old oak beams.In a barn in the
 grounds there is an old cider press,  
 also an original cobbled stable which 
 is now used as a storeroom.The gardens
 are beautiful and are open to the     
 public twice a year in the summer.    
 There are lots of old fashioned roses 
 and a large amount of lawn.
