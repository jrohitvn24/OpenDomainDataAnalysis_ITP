		<title>04  LITTLE BROOK POWER STATION</title>
		<content>Ther are four power stations at Little 
Brook, A.B.C and D but only one is in  
operation at the present.  A power     
station started working in 1939 and    
closed in 1971, B station started in   
1947 and closed in 1977 and C station  
started in 1959 and closed in 1981.    
The D power station started to produce 
in 1981 and is still operational today.
The pwer stations are situated on 179  
acres of marsh land and is aprximatley 
200 yards from the river Thames.       
The power station employs 30 women in  
the offices and 220 men in the central 
control room and engineering.  The fuel
they use is oil and is transported by  
tankers which come up the river Thames.
The chimney for the waste gases are    
very high so as not to polute the      
atmosphere with dangerous fumes.       
The cost to build the Power station was
700 million pounds.                    </content>
