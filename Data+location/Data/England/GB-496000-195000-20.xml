		<title>20PEOPLE'S ATTITUDES</title>
		<content> The countryside around is very        
 pleasant with many enchanting walks   
 and interesting houses. The county is 
 known as "leafy Bucks." and living    
 here one can certainly see why. Much  
 of the land around was originally     
 strip farming and historically it is  
 very interesting. The coming of the   
 railway helped to open up the area and
 bring  London and its life and        
 attitudes much closer.  The people    
 tend to be moving upwards socially and
 are keenly aware of the importance of 
 education.  This has its good and its 
 bad side. For education tends not to  
 be valued for itself; instead it is   
 seen as a prerequisite for acquiring  
 greater material wealth. The local    
 inhabitants are competitive, perhaps  
 rather dissatisfied, and they do not  
 seem to value culture. It is really   
 rather depressing.                    </content>
