		<title>12MINOR ROUTES, BURSTON AREA</title>
		<content>                                       
The local network of small lanes and   
footpaths is very old, eg Butterhill   
Lane is an old drovers' road.  The     
lanes are essential for access to farms
especially for the collection of milk. 
Some are narrow with grass growing down
the middle, and receive little mainten-
ance from the Council.  A few farms    
have privately owned tracks.           
                                       
Some of these old routes are still     
bridleways or footpaths. They must have
been important in the days before      
mechanisation.  On the whole they are  
not well used now, as the local people 
prefer to use cars for their daily     
needs.  However these footpaths are a  
valuable local amenity for those       
wishing to enjoy the rural scenery and 
a feeling of "returning to nature".
