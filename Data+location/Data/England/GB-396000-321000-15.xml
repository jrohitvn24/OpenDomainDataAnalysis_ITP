		<title>15FAMILY LIFE-GREAT HAYWOOD.</title>
		<content>  My name is Andrew Mellows. I am 11   
years old and I live at 7, Abbey Drive,
Little Haywood. I go to St. John's     
School Great Haywood. My dad is a      
greengrocer.                           
  I have 1 brother and 1 sister. My    
brother is 9 years old, my sister is 4 
years old. My mum is a housewife.      
  We have a few rules like, no feet on 
the furniture, no eating in the lounge.
  I have two responsibilities in my    
house. I have to feed my pet and I     
have to tidy my bedroom. I like to     
play snooker, football and cricket. I  
go to bed at 9.30 and I get up at      
7.30. I catch a bus at 8.40am. School  
begins at 9.00am and finishes at       
3.45p.m.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
