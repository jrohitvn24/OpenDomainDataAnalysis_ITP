		<title>17WARDLE SCOUTS</title>
		<content>  Every Wednesday I go to a group at   
 the top of the village.It is called   
 scouts.It starts at 7.30p.m.and ends  
 at 9.30p.m.to 10.00p.m.               
  We play lots of games.One of the     
 games is called 'murder ball'.To play 
 it you have to have a large space, a  
 ball, two teams and a piece of chalk. 
 Mark an area for the pitch_ draw two  
 circles,one on each side,then a person
 throws a ball in the middle and each  
 team has to try and get the ball in   
 the other team's circle.              
  We also do a lot of activities like  
 canoeing and hiking.                  
  Every year we go to about three      
 camps. In August we go on a one weeks 
 camp. At the camp we sleep under      
 canvas and we go water skiing,        
 canoeing, absailing, hiking and quite 
 often we go rockclimbing.
