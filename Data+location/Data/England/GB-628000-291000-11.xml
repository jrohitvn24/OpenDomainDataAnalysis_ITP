 stock farming is also important.Bed-  
 ingham farms include a dairy herd of  
 150 pedigree Friesians,a flock of 700 
 pedigree Suffolks &amp; another of 300 on 
 a smallholding;another carries a small
 herd of pedigree Herefords as well as 
 riding horses.Hedenham has 2 intensive
 livestock units,1 poultry &amp; the other-
 a recent,unwelcome addition -for pigs.
 The estate has a herd of 20 White Park
 cattle with an interesting history.In 
 1248 Baron de Ferrars of Chartley was 
 allowed to enclose 1000a. of Needwood 
 Forest &amp; 25 cows &amp; 1 bull were intro- 
 duced there &amp; left wild.In 1905 the   
 Duke of Bedford bought them &amp; then in 
 1970 the Earl Ferrars bought them     
 back.Lord Ferrars is a member of the  
{Rare Breeds Survival Trust}so is happy
 to be able to conserve this rare breed
 so closely associated with his name.  </content>
