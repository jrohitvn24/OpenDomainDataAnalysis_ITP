		<title>09My Street in Harpenden</title>
		<content> My street is well kept and tidy.   The
 houses are different sizes some fat,  
 some thin and some standing together  
 for company.  My street is a green    
 street, a colourful street, the houses
 are bright and the gardens are pretty 
 and have trees in them.   Old people  
 live in my street young people too.   
 Children play in their gardens making 
 lots of noise.   My street is a long, 
 busy street, dads with brief cases    
 walk down it to the station every     
 morning. My street is safe in the     
 middle of the day and quiet but its   
 dangerous in the morning and the      
 evening because of the traffic.   My  
 street is a friendly street because   
 everyone has time to say hello and is 
 pleasant to you.                      
                                       
       My street is the best!
