		<content>My family come from different parts of 
Lancashire.My Mother was born in       
Rossendale and my Dad was born in      
Hopwood.They met in Manchester where   
Dad was a telephonist and later moved  
to Bedfordshire when he started to work
for 3M.In l974 he was promoted and     
moved to Chorley.When  I was little he 
used to fly all over the world and we  
considered moving to America,where we  
spent our holidays in l983.Although he 
is 4l years old he has only had l0     
proper birthdays.My Mother also works  
full-time at ROF Chorley.They both     
support Manchester United.I have a     
sister-Lisa l3 yrs old who enjoys all  
kinds of sports.I would like to live   
on a farm with a riding school or be   
a Mounted Policewoman.My grandparents  
still live in Hopwood and Rossendale.  
Our dog still remembers the pain of    
an accident and still trembles at vets.</content>
