		<title>02THE WARMINSTER BY-PASS</title>
		<content>  For over 30 years there have been    
 plans to by-pass Warminster.          
  The town is an important road        
 transport route centre.The result is  
 heavy traffic all day long. Much of   
 the traffic consists of heavy lorries 
 - especially those carrying Mendip    
 limestone to the South East.          
  Other heavy traffic consists of      
 container lorries travelling between  
 the ports of Bristol and Southampton. 
  The noise,fumes and vibrations caused
 by this heavy through traffic led to a
 lengthy campaign by local people until
 the Government announced a new road to
 open in 1987, by-passing the town and 
 rejoining the A36 at Heytesbury.      
  Public opinion is divided.Some prefer
 a quiet town with a traffic free main 
 street.Others are concerned that      
 businesses will lose a vital part of  
 their trade.                          </content>
