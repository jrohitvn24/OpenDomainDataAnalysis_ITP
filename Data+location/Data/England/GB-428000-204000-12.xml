		<title>12UNIVERSITY FARM NEAR LEW</title>
		<content> The farm and old farmhouse were       
 purchased from{University College,    
{Oxford}in{1959.}It is a dairy farm of 
 216 acres with 175 acres of cultivated
 pasture and 40 acres{Winter Wheat.    
{Forage Rye &amp; Turnips}are grown as a   
 part of crop rotation. Each of the 116
 cows is expected to produce{5,500     
 litres of milk annually. The cows are 
 milked twice daily in a 12/12         
{Herringbone Milking Parlour.}Their    
 feed is{computer controlled}by a      
 two_way transmitter worn around their 
 necks. Each cow receives exact amount 
 selected by farmer. Any cows not      
 feeding correctly appear on printout  
 and can be checked.{60 dairy calves   
 are bred each year by artificial      
 insemination to replace old stock. The
 other cows mate with the farm's       
{Charollais Bull}for beef production.  
 Milk quotas are strictly applied.     </content>
