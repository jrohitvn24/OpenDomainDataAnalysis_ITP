 GENERAL STRIKE.{                      
 When he was 14,he went to a grammer   
 school.His dad worked on the dock's in
 Liverpool.Most of the people he knew  
 were in the shipping business and the 
 fight was over wages.It was the only  
 time in British history that there has
 been a general strike.If a man        
 wouldn't work the government wouldn't 
 pay him.The union at that time paid 2s
 6p if there was a strike.Relative to  
 what George was saying,in those       
 days,the wage for a man on the docks  
 was Â£1 10s.Food was rather cheap.The  
 issue was so important to the working 
 man that the strike lasted 3 to 4     
 months.The only force that kept on    
 working was the police force,they     
 kept order when there were            
 demonstrations.                       </content>
