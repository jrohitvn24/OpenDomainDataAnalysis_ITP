		<title>06MY DADDY'S WORK</title>
		<content> My Daddy has been in Northumbria      
 Police Force seventeen years. He has  
 passed the test to drive Panda cars.  
 He has been trained in the use of     
 computers,teleprinters and radio      
 equipment. When he was in the Control 
 Room he had to send policemen to      
 incidents in the city and had to send 
 policemen, ambulances and fire engines
 to the airport if an aeroplane was    
 having trouble landing.

 My Daddy is a policeman. He works in  
 Newcastle. He has a special job and   
 does not wear a uniform. He always    
 works with a partner,sometimes a man, 
 sometimes a woman. I do not see him at
 night very often because he comes home
 at two o'clock in the morning.
