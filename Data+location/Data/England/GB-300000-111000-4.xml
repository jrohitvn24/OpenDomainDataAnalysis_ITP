		<title>04HOUSING IN HALBERTON</title>
		<content>    The {houses in the Halberton area} 
 are really scruffy but most of them   
 that are scruffy are in the High      
 Street because of the traffic fumes   
 which make them dirty,but some of the 
 houses are beautiful.Some are thatched
 but most have slate roofs.The houses  
 on the outskirts are quite nice and so
 are some in the centre of             
 Halberton.Some of the houses in       
 Halberton have plaster coming from the
 walls and on some of the doors there  
 is rust .                             
   In Halberton there are{556 houses   
{and 24 farmhouses}but 2 of those are  
 empty.There are{106 council houses    
{including flats and bungalows.        
  {427 people}are registered on the    
 electoral roll in Halberton.We        
 estimated that also there are{75}     
 children in Halberton.So the          
 population is approximately{600.      </content>
