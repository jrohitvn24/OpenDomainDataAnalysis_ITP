		<title>12Sale for Ethiopia</title>
		<content>    On the 9th May 1985{Yellow Class}  
 held a{sale}to help raise money to    
 provide food, water and blankets for  
 the starving people of{Ethiopia.}     
    Children from the class spent      
 several weeks preparing for the sale. 
 We made sweets, television and pop    
 star badges, note books, pencil       
 holders, colouring books and knitted  
 purses. We also sold books, comics and
 drinks.                               
    We held the sale in the playground 
 at 10.30 a.m. during morning break and
 the three other classes from our      
 school came to buy from our stalls. By
 the end of break everything that we   
 had made was sold.                    
    We raised nearly Â£30 and we hope   
 that it will bring joy to some of the 
 starving Ethiopians.
