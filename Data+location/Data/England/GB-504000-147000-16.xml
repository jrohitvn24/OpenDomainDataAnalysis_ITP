		<title>16LOCAL EVENTS IN SHERE</title>
		<content>   Every Summer in Shere there is a    
 Fair in the Square, it always takes   
 place on a Sunday in the square. This 
 event has been taking place for       
 fifteen years. There is always a theme
 such as Victorian last year and its   
 going French this year. There are many
 stalls in the square and a fancy dress
 competition for the children and Shere
 School children always do country     
 dancing. I was chosen to dance for the
 Fair in the Square. We had to wear a  
 tie, white shirt and shorts. We did   
 four dances, we did 'Bonnie Prince    
 Charlie','Music Man','Fun of the Fair'
 and 'Durham Reel'. There were lots of 
 people watching us, some of the people
 were Mrs. Colmer's dancing friends.   
 After the dance Mrs.Colmer's friends  
 said it was very good. The people who 
 did the dancing all had an ice-cream.
