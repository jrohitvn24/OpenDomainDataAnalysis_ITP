		<title>15RECENT LOCAL NEWS STORIES</title>
		<content> The "Newport and Market Drayton       
 Advertiser" is the{local weekly}      
 Shropshire newspaper, and we looked at
 some old copies.                      
 One story was about some{councillors  
{from Crewe,}who{wanted to take Woore  
{and Adderley into Cheshire.} Most     
 villagers were very much against this,
 as they had been when Newcastle wanted
 to take over Woore.                   
 The Parish Council is concerned about 
{danger on the road}from Gravenhunger. 
 It is narrow and more big lorries have
 started using it since the miners'    
 strike.                               
 A story which kept coming up was about
 a court case concerning{the village   
{green}between the Parish Council and  
 a resident of the village.            
 A pleasant story appeared of our own  
{school's link}with St Mary's School,  
 Altinure in Northern Ireland.         </content>
