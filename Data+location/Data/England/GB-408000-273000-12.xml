		<title>12Clowes Wood.</title>
		<content> This has been an area of woodland     
 since the{Ice Age.}In Norman times it 
 was part of the {Forest of Arden}which
 was declared a hunting forest by the  
 Normans. Until the late 15th century  
 the woods were used as a source of    
 material for houses,furniture etc:    
 Cattle and pigs grazed there. The king
 realised the "source" would disappear 
 eventually so he enclosed woods for 7 
 years to simulate growth.The Earl of  
 Warwick enclosed New Fallings Coppice 
 and it became known as Earls'wood.    
 Clowes wood takes its name from       
 Catherine Clowes of Tanworth.Recently 
 both woods belonged to {Cadbury's     
{Trust}but they sold Clowes wood to    
 WARNACT and today it is a {Site of    
{Special Scientific Interest.}In 1908  
 the Warwickshire Railway line was     
 brought through the woods and most of 
 the trees were cleared.               </content>
