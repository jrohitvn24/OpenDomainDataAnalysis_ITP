		<title>01REVIEW    Pentney &amp; Narboro'</title>
		<content>{Pentney and Narborough}are two        
 villages situated in the Nar valley   
 which is a predominately rural farming
 area in north west Norfolk.           
                                       
 The nearest large town is{King's Lynn}
 8 miles to the west and the smaller   
 market town of{Swaffham}is 7 miles to 
 the south east. A large operational   
 R.A.F. station is situated a mile to  
 the south at{Marham.                  
                                       
 It is a pleasant area attracting many 
 visitors who come to stay at the      
 caravan park or to partake of such    
 amenities as trout fishing, water     
 ski-ing and bowls.                    
                                       
 Many buildings are of historic        
 interest and the two villages are     
 worth stopping off to look at when    
 passing through.                      </content>
