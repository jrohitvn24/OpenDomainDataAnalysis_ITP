 mission church.John gets up at about

 himself and his wife.John's wife goes 
 to work at about 7.30.On two of the   
 days John takes her to work by        
 car.From 7.45 to 8.45 John is involved
 with the spiritual worship of the     
 church.After this John goes to work.  
 Because of the nature of John's job   
 his day is unpredictable.John usually 
 prepares the evening meal,which he and
 his wife eat at about 5.30.p.m.       
 Normally John would hope to go to bed 
 at about 10.00 , after having done    
 more work to do with the church. Being
 a minister John is often called out at
 all hours of the night to help people 
 in need.
