		<content> As there are many people in Stevington
 who do not have transport,the mobile  
 services play an important part in    
 village life.The mobile library visits
 the centre of the village regularly as
 do the chiropody service and baby     
 clinic.Milk and other dairy products  
 are delivered daily to our doors and a
 butcher delivers weekly.As there is no
 mains gas,the calor gas and coal      
 lorries and oil tankers are often seen
 in the village.Logs are delivered to  
 homes with wood burning stoves and    
 open fires.In the summer an ice cream 
 van makes daily visits and a frozen   
 food company has recently started a   
 delivery service.For those houses not 
 connected to the main sewer a sewage  
 removal tanker calls to empty their   
 cess pits.
