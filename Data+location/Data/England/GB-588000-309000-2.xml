		<content> There are six local bus services      
 during the week to the neighbouring   
 towns of Swaffham(2), Watton, Dereham,
 Kings Lynn and the city of Norwich.   
 Additionally there is a daily Eastern 
 Counties service to Norwich which     
 stops at the top of Necton on the A47.
                                       
   The majority of the inhabitants own 
 a car as they are essential for       
 getting to work and for shopping out  
 of the village.  Those households     
 where there are working sons or       
 daughters can own up to 4 cars per    
 house.                                
                                       
    The rural roads are mainly narrow  
 and full of bends.  They are generally
 kept in good repair although some have
 several potholes.  They are easily    
 blocked by snow in Winter.The A47 is a
 very busy road particularly in Summer.</content>
