		<title>14Mow Cop boundary</title>
		<content>  There is at the present time, a      
fierce dispute regarding the boundary  
at Mow Cop. It has been proposed that  
the village is put into Staffordshire  
rather than at present half in         
Cheshire. There has been a lot of      
resentment by the Cheshire dwelling    
folk leading to petitions,letters to   
the local papers and car stickers      
saying "Hands off Mow Cop". Congleton  
MP has also written to try and pursuade
against such an alteration.            
    The strength of local opinion to   
fight against change has surprised a   
lot of people. This is significant as  
it shows the strong local identity of  
                                       
the community on each side of the      
county border.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
