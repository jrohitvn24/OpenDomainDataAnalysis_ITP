		<content>   I live in a terraced house on an    
 estate called Clos Orange.  We are    
 buying it with a States Loan          
 (special mortgage). It was built about
 5 years ago.  My house has a rendered 
 finish, but there are others that are 
 pink brick.                           
                                       
   I have 3 bedrooms, one for each of  
 my children and one larger for my     
 husband and I, a bathroom, a kitchen, 
 lounge/diner, downstairs toilet and   
 garage.  Our kitchen is quite large so
 for every day use we eat at a         
 breakfast bar with stools. There is a 
 garden front and back, the larger     
 being at the back where I grow a few  
 vegetables.  In the front garden      
 we have a small lawn and enough space 
 to park 4 cars. It is a very nice     
 quiet estate and we are very pleased  
 with our house.                       </content>
