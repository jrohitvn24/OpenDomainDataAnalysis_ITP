 We asked people for their views about 
 the area and other items of interest. 
                                       
 On pollution, people said:            
 "Well you cant do much about it can   
 you?"                                 
 "The horse and cart were much better  
 and cleaner."                         
 "Its got out of hand."                
 "Its too late to do anything about    
 it."                                  
                                       
 About C5 cars (electric cars from     
 Sinclair Research) people said:       
 "They are dangerous and should be     
 banned."                              
 "I would not ride in one."            
 "They look so unsteady and weak."
