 AS FARM WORKERS COTTAGES BELONGING TO 
{OAKS}FARM.THEY WERE NOT NAMED BROOK   
 COTTAGES UNTIL THEY WERE RENOVATED IN 
 1971.                                 
     IN WINTER THEY OFTEN GET SNOWED IN
 AND THEY OFTEN CANNOT TRAVEL DOWN THE 
 LANE (WEST) TOWARDS WARWICK AS THE    
 FORD NEAR THE COTTAGES IS FLOODED.    
     THE WATER SUPPLY TO THE COTTAGES  
 IS NOT VERY EFFICIENT. THERE WAS NO   
 WATER SUPPLY UNTIL 1945, UNTIL THEN   
 THE FARMER USED TO DELIVER IT.        
     THE BARRATTS HAVE NO PETS BUT THEY
 OWN ONE THIRD OF AN ACRE OF LAND AND  
 HAVE RABBITS AND FOXES VISITING THEIR 
 GARDEN.
