		<title>18A LOCAL SHOPKEEPER SPEAKS.</title>
		<content> He sells vegetables, citrus fruit,    
 bananas, grapes and confectionery.    
 He used to go around selling door to  
 door but now finds business good      
 enough to stay in one place.His       
 business has grown quickly over the   
 last ten years and is still growing.  
 He has two Transit vans and a large   
 lorry.He has three shops in all.He has
 a staff of about 18 people and they   
 all work part-time.He has no intention
 of moving areas and finds business    
 good in all of his shops.             
 His best selling vegetable is the     
 potato.                               
 Selling is easier now than when he    
 started the business because people   
 have more money to spend.Another point
 might be that less people grow their  
 own vegetables today than in years    
 ago.
