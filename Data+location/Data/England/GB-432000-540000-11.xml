      On a farm there are lots of      
 Animals. There are pigs and Horses in 
 the field, and cows and bulls. Most of
 the cows are either frrisians or      
 charolets. At night and in the        
 morning, the cows get milked. There   
 are also some hens At the Farm up the 
 road from where I Live.               
      He is a nice farmer, sometimes he
 has a scramble for the motor bikes on 
 some of his waste land. He grows      
 mushrooms and you can pick them. The  
 farmer has four dogs. sometimes he    
 Lets us children go up to see his     
 calves and lambs and foals.
