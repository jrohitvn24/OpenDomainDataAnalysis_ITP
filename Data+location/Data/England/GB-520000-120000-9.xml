 was founded at Brookhill by The Rev.R.

 Charles Kettle.Later on there was a   
 Girl's School on a site near the      
 present school.For some years there   
 was a Grammar School for boys at      
 Bull's Bridge.                        
{ST PETER'S SCHOOL.}The present school 
 was built in  1870 by Richard Hoper at
 his own cost.In 1909 it was enlarged  
 and it was rebuilt in its present form
 in 1965.The school caters for children
 aged from 5 to 11 and has 74 children 
 on roll.The school has a large playing
 field and a swimming pool which was   
 built by the village in memory of     
 three local boys who were drowned at

 Comprehensive Schools in Horsham or   
 Steyning.The headmaster is Mr.R.Smith.</content>
