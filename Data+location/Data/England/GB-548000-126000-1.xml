		<title>01HIGH HURSTWOOD GENERAL VIEW</title>
		<content> Lying in an area of Outstanding       
 Natural Beauty to the South West of   
 Crowborough is the village of High    
 Hurstwood with two small neighbouring 
 hamlets Sweethaws and Herons Ghyll.   
 This is mainly farmland and           
 residential country with areas of     
 woodland. From the higher land to the 
 North there are splendid views of the 
 South Downs while the lower levels    
 have a less extensive outlook but     
 enjoy a milder sheltered climate. The 
 A26 crosses the North West corner but 
 most of the roads are narrow and      
 twist at random between hedges and    
 steep banks, following the lines of   
 ancient farm tracks and ill-suited to 
 modern traffic. A network of footpaths
 enables the public to walk often      
 across otherwise private property.
