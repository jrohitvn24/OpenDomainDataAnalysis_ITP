{Bassett? }                            
 The census of 1981 showed there were  
 9,135 people living in Wootton        
 Bassett.Now in 1985 there are about   
 10,000 to 11,000 people.There are 240 
 old age pensioners living in council  
 property and there are about 700      
 council houses altogether.            
 Some of us went to the High Street to 
 ask people questions.We wanted to find
 out from those people who live in     
 Wootton Bassett,how many were actually
 born here.We asked 15 people if they  
 lived in Wootton Bassett and 11 said  
 "yes".Ofthese 11 only 2 were born here
 though.The others came here because of
 their work or their marriage.We asked 
 if they liked living here. 9 said     
 "yes"and 2"no".One person said "it's a
 good commmunity".Another said"it's    
 very central to other towns".         </content>
