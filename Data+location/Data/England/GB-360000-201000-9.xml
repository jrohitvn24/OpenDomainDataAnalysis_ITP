		<title>09A Methodist Minister's Week</title>
		<content>    What does a minister do besides    
 taking services? we asked the Rev.M.  
 Johnson.His reply included such items 
 as weddings,funerals,baptisms,circuit 
 meetings,sick visiting,helping those  
 with problems and raising money for   
 the church and charities.Then there   
 are church activities such as Junior  
 Endeavour or Church Fellowship which, 
 he said,are well attended.            
    We found Springfield Church,built  
 in 1869,to be attractively decorated  
 and furnished.It was,he said,adequate 
 for his needs,though he would welcome 
 an extra Sunday School room.          
    He is optimistic about the future  
 of the church.Most public occasions   
 attract smaller numbers these days but
 people still want to use churches at  
 special times.Those attending services
 go through a desire to take part in   
 worship,not because of coercion.      </content>
