		<title>08Transport in Saxilby Area</title>
		<content> Saxilby  is almost self-contained, but
 the railway station brings  London  or
 Scotland quickly within reach. Locally
 , it is faster to travel to Lincoln or
 Gainsborough  by train than bus, since
 only a few buses  use  the  A57  trunk
 road.  They pick up from villages like
 Skellingthorpe,   making   the   route
 appear  tortuous.  There are no Sunday
 buses and the last evening bus  leaves
 Lincoln  at  5.40pm  taking 23 minutes
 along the main road. In  contrast  the
 last  train  leaves Lincoln at 10.30pm
 and  there  is  a  restricted   Sunday
 service.  There  are  school  buses, a
 shopping bus to Tesco in Lincoln  plus
 a private firm operating to Lincoln on
 Fridays  and  Saturdays. Coach outings
 are popularand there are 2 taxi firms.
 Bicycles are useful, but a car becomes
 essential in  the  more  rural  areas.
 Broxholme has no bus service now.     </content>
