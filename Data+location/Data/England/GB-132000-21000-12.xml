		<title>12Shipwrecks around St. Levan</title>
		<content>{The coast of Cornwall is dangerous to 
{all shipping,}even with today's       
 electronic aids.{Once a ship strikes  
 the granite rocks of the St. Levan    
 cliffs{there is generally little that 
{can be done to prevent its total loss.
 In 1957 a fishing boat was smashed to 
 matchwood over a half-hour period at  
 Pednavounder, and that was on a sandy 
 beach. One of the very few lucky ones,
 a yacht 'Esperancia' enroute from     
 Brazil to Rotterdam, sailed into      
 Porthgwarra Cove at night, sunk and   
 was refloated. Other ships, lost on   
 the coast of St. Levan this century   
 include: Khyber 1905, St. Guenole,    
 1948, Vert Prairial 1957, Nararene    
 1957, Saba 1966. Since 1900 another   
 seven have sunk on the Runnelstone,   
 one mile off Porthgwarra. The 'City of
 Westminster' lost in 1923, reportedly 
 knocked two two metres of this rock.  </content>
