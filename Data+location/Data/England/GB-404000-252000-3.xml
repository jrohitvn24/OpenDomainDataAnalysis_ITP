		<title>03A School Day at Dunnington</title>
		<content> My name is Sharon Stinton. Today I got
 up at 7-45am, washed, dressed in jeans
 and a jumper. For breakfast I had     
 toast with jam and a cup of tea. I    
 watched a video taped from the        
 television last night. I washed up and
 mum drove me to school at 8-45am. At  
 9-00am we set off in the coach to     
 Stratford swimming pool. The whole    
 school goes swimming every Monday     
 morning. We got back to school at     
 10-30am and Amanda and I sold crisps  
 during playtime. After play we did    
 English until lunchtime. Those of us  
 who brought sandwiches were allowed to
 eat them on the school playing field. 
 After lunch, at 1-00pm, we did some   
 maths. At 2-15pm we went out to play  
 again. Amanda and I fed the school    
 rabbit. After break Mr. Reeks read us 
 a story. At 3-30pm mum took us home. I
 watched t.v. until bedtime at 8-30pm. </content>
