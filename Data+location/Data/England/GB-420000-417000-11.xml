		<title>11LEDGARD BRIDGE BOATYARD</title>
		<content> The boatyard is on the site of John   
 Smeaton's original canal route which  
 was later blocked off and the original
 lock chamber converted into a dry     
 dock. It was the most important       
 boatyard on the Calder &amp; Hebble       
 navigation during the period of 'Canal
 Mania'(1790's) when Mirfield had a    
 prosperous boat-building industry,    
 making wooden keels. There was a black
 smith's business to cater for the     
 barge horses and implements are still 
 on the site. It was last used comm-   
 ercially between 1954 and '73 for the 
 maintenance of wooden and steel boats 
 carrying coal to Thornhill Power      
 Station. The house in the boatyard was
 used by Wm.Jessop whilst constructing 
 the C.&amp; H.N. The present owner lives  
 in the house, repairing old &amp; modern  
 craft and running a Water Bus Service 
 between Mirfield and Brighouse.       </content>
