{builder.}He works in and around       
 Apperley. Building is not the only    
 thing he does; all the trades usually 
 sub-contracted are performed by       
 himself. He concerns himself mostly   
 with farms, usually obtaining his     
 equipment &amp; materials from nearby     
 towns.

 gaining a{County Council farm}for     
 serving in the First World War. In    
 1962 he died and his only son took    
 over. In 1982 he gave up the farm to  
 become a{small holder}and an          
{agricultural contracter.}Now his work 
 involves hedgelaying, haymaking,      
 fencing and on Mondays he has a       
 regular job at{Gloucester}Market.He   
 owns 15 acres of land which is used   
 for producing hay and breeding fat    
 lambs for meat.                       </content>
