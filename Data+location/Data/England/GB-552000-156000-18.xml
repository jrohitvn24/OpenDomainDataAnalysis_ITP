		<content>Horse Riding: There are several stables
fields and tracks, some for training   
and some for show-jumping, and some for
fun.  Riding is mostly for the farmers 
but there is a riding school also.     
There are two golf courses which are   
well-supported.                        
Sailing: There are facilities for      
sailing and windsurfing on flooded clay
and gravel pits, but these are fairly  
expensive pastimes.                    
Shooting: This is popular and caters   
for many people most of whom belong to 
clubs.                                 
Fishing: The lakes and flooded         
quarries provide managed facilities    
for individuals and several clubs.     
Wildernesse Sports Centre: Facilities  
for squash, tennis etc. are available  
to the public at evenings and          
weekends. There are also soccer,       
cricket and hockey leagues.            </content>
