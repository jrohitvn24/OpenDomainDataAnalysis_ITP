		<title>15A SUMMER'S DAY IN RAMSGATE</title>
		<content>Saturday July 20 1985 dawned bright and
sunny.Light aircraft were flying over  
Ramsgate &amp; landing at Manston Airport. 
The passengers got into cars and set   
off for Sandwich.In Ramsgate,many more 
were going in cars also heading for    
Sandwich,to watch the world's golfing  
greats in the British Open tournament. 
The clouds built up;it rained for a    
time &amp; traffic eased.Towards noon, the 
traffic increased,this time heading for
Manston airfield.Soon,every space along
local roads &amp; farm tracks was taken up 
by cars.At about 12.30,clouds &amp; rain   
almost obscured the triangular shaped  
object descending from the sky.It was  
the famous Concorde,paying a special   
visit.During the afternoon,a storm     
halted the golf for a while.As evening 
approached,strange brown clouds        
appeared &amp; engulfed the area in a very 
bad hailstorm.Typical summer weather!!!</content>
