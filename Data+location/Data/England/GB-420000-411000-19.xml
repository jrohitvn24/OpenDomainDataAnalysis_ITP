		<title>19THE OWNER OF GRYCE HALL</title>
		<content> Lord Savile is the owner of Gryce     
 Hall. It says in 'WHO'S WHO' 1978 that
 he owns 18,000 acres of land and he   
 enjoys shooting and music. His full   
 name is George Halifax Lumley Savile  
 and he was born on the 24th of January
 1919. Lord Savile has been J.P. of    
 Dewsbury since 1955 and (Deputy       
 Lieutenant of Yorkshire since 1954).  
 He is a commander of the knights of   
 St. John. When we spoke to him on the 
 telephone he told us more about       
 himself. He is not related to the     
 Queen and he is a bachelor. He is a   
 member of the House Of Lords which he 
 says is hard work at times. While he  
 is away two cooks and a house keeper  
 look after Gryce Hall. His favourite  
 composer is Mozart. We think Lord     
 Savile is very lucky to live at Gryce 
 Hall.
