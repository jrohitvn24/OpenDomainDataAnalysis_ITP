		<title>05Economics of CARE</title>
		<content> CARE villages now have total assets in
 property of some Â£4 million and look  
 after the well being of 254 mentally  
 handicapped people.                   
 CARE has to find by fund raising,all  
 the capital costs of aquiring and     
 developing property to make it        
 suitable for occupation,for building  
 and equiping workshops and,currently, 
 the average per capita cost of        
 establishing all facilities  is       
 running at about Â£220,000 per head.   
 This of course is subject like        
 everything else,to inflation.The fees 
 charged to Local Authorities,which in 
 90% of cases support the villagers are
 established each year in the form of a
 forecast for the following year based 
 on current costing &amp; are submitted to 
 &amp; agreed by Leicestershire on behalf  
 of all other Local Authorities.
