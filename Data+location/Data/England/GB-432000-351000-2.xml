		<title>02Old Fritchley School</title>
		<content> In 1870 Fritchley C of E Primary      
 School was opened. Miss Susanah Rogers
 was the first headteacher. She kept a 
 daily record of work in the log book  
 which is very interesting reading.    
 In 1897 it is recorded that the school
 was closed by the Authority due to a  
 whooping cough epidemic and reopened  
 in February, only to be closed again  
 and not reopened until 22nd March. In 
 June 1910 a rather interesting entry  
 appears showing that Fritchley        
 children in 1910 were no different to 
 Fritchley children in 1985. It states 
 "owing to complaints of a tenant of   
 the field adjoining the school        
 premises I have been compelled to ask 
 boys to cease playing football in the 
 playground". On May 24th 1906 Empire  
 day was celebrated for the first time.
 Inspectors came every year to inspect 
 the children and give a report.       </content>
