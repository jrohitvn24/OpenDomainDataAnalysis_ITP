		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content>  1This area lies in the Brendon Hills 
 and contains part of Clatworthy       
 reservoir. The area is mostly farming 
 with a little woodland, the farms     
 being small.                          
 There is considerable evidence of     
 rural depopulation and the remaining  
 inhabitants have to go outside the    
 area for shops, entertainments etc.   
 The area is very picturesque, but is  
 off the main tourist routes and so    
 remains unspoilt countryside due      
 partly to its inaccessability.        
 The area contains only one large      
 occupied house, Bittescombe Manor, the
 other buildings being fairly small    
 farms.                                
 Generally the land has to be improved 
 for grazing and there are areas that  
 have reverted to their natural state.
