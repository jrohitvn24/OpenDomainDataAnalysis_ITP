		<title>03EMPLOYMENT AROUND BERROW</title>
		<content>   {Agriculture}is the main employment 
 here, either self_employed or for     
 wages. Some agriculture is seasonal   
 eg. fruit_picking and market          
 gardening; this is often done by      
 housewives. Labour relations generally
 are good.Many people make money by    
{producing and selling goods}from their
 gardens eg. eggs, chickens, lettuce,  
 tomatoes. Unemployed people may suffer
 less than elsewhere as they can       
 produce more food in their enforced   
 leisure. There are some{small         
{employers}running pubs, shops and a   
 garage, and one agricultural engineer.
 Some women do local domestic work.    
 Many people travel to work outside the
 area _ eg. in Tewkesbury, Ledbury,    
 Malvern and as far afield as          
 Birmingham. There are retired people  
 in the area.
