		<content>{North Weald Station,}on the Central   
 Line of London Transport, has the     
 distinction of being the highest      
 on the network, and having the only   
 public level-crossing, albeit a farm  
 accommodation crossing now used only  
 by pedestrians.                       
   The station building is a typical   
 example of Great Eastern architecture,
 but train services are now only       
 provided during Monday to Friday      
 peak hours, the whole question of the 
 rail service to North Weald and Ongar 
 having been the subject of much public
 controversy in recent times.          
   The former London Transport         
 Executive abandoned over a decade ago 
 the premise that suburban commuter    
 railways are costed as a whole,       
 with the overcrowded inner parts      
 balancing the lightly used outer ends.
