		<title>11Attitudes in Kings Heath</title>
		<content>A large number of old people live in   
Kings Heath. Some in flats, others in  
specially designed communities such as 
{Alcester Gardens}. This consists of 8 
bungalows housing up to 16. The purpose
of placing the elderly in a mixed area 
was to{encourage young and old to mix} 
and become aware of the problems and   
ideas of each. This has not happened.  
The elderly, in general, find the young
rude, disrespectful, unhelpful and     
immoral. {Great changes in standards}  
this century mean elderly people have  
difficulty understanding problems like 
drug abuse, unemployment and race      
relations. The elderly in Kings Heath  
have seen{vast changes in attitudes}in 
the past 10 years. Shops are more      
impersonal with quality and courtesy on
the decline. A local pensioner is      
pessimistic, though sympathetic, about 
the future  for the youth of today.    </content>
