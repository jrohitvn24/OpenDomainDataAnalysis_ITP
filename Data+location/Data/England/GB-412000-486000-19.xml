		<content> My Saturday.                          
 I have Coco Pops for breakfast,then   
 brush my teeth with Crest toothpaste. 
 I go outside to play on the swing. I  
 like to go high, as high as the fence.
 I go inside to watch 'Number 73' on   
 T.V.then we go shopping to Leyburn. We
 have fish and chips for lunch which we
 eat in the car. I just have chips. If 
 I can't eat them all I give them to   
 the pigeons.I have 50p. pocket money. 
 I spend it on key rings &amp; pencil      
 sharpeners.When I get home I play with
 Rebecca. She lives on a farm &amp; has 4  
 dogs. We paddle in the Beck when it is
 hot.For tea I have salad              
 sandwiches,then ride my bike up High  
 Fields. At bedtime I put on my night_ 
 dress and read my book,'Milly Molly   
 Mandy'. At 9.30pm. I watch 'Tales Of  
 The Unexpected' on my T.V.in my       
 bedroom then go to sleep.             </content>
