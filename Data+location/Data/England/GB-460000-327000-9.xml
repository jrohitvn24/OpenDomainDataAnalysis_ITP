		<content> Amenities in Wysall have diminished   
 since the mid 1970s. There is no lon- 
 ger a butcher's shop, general store or
 post office; this may be due in part  
 to the fact that most families own a  
 car and can travel to large supermar- 
 kets, which have larger stocks and    
 lower prices. A mobile greengrocery   
 service calls once a week, a butcher  
 and a baker each call twice a week, a 
 fishmonger (female) once a week and   
 also a library van once a fortnight. A
 post office service is held every     
 Thursday for 2 hours, run by the post-
 mistress from Willoughby, who will    
 also bring items from her shop if     
 asked by 'phone. Widmerpool has no    
 shops. There is no doctor in the      
 block; residents must travel to Key-  
 worth, East Leake or Barrow upon Soar.
 Newspapers brought from East Leake to 
 Wysall are delivered by local children</content>
