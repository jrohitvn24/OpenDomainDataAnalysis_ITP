  On the streets today you will see    
 'Breakdancin'. If it's done properly  
 you will see 'popin' 'spinin' and     
 all the rest.                         
 Dancers have their own language;      
 words such as 'bad' meaning very good 
 and 'buggin out' meaning going like   
 crazy.                                
 Dancers usually wear Nike, Adidas or  
 Fila clothes, and footwear is         
 important for walking on your toes -  
 'floatin'.                            
 'Breakin' started about 7 years ago in
 The Bronx, an area of New York, where 
 gangs fought each other. People were  
 sometimes killed and so another       
 solution was sought, this was         
 'Breakdancin'.                        
 Even in Yorkshire 'battles' are fought
 between different teams.
