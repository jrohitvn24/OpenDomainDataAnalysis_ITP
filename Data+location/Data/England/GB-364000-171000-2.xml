		<content> In our wildlife survey of 150 parents 
 of Longwell Green Primary School 55   
 had seen foxes and 20 had seen{badgers
  in their gardens. Other mammals seen 
 were hedgehogs,rabbits,bats,grey      
 squirrels,weasels,rats,shrews and     
 voles.                                
 The{badger's}set is in our school     
 playing field. They go into gardens   
 through holes in fences or hedges or  
 by burrowing underneath.They are pests
 in the gardens by attacking rabbits in
 their hutch and digging holes.Other   
 people attract badgers by putting down
 chocolate spread on bread, or cold    
 potatoes and meat.This often brings   
 them out during the daytime. They     
 noticed older badgers make grunting   
 noises while younger animals whine.
