 live in North Duffield to find out    
 what they did,where they work,and the 
 time they leave and return from work.

 Selby,and 9 work else where. In the   
 men we asked,5 work in farming,4 are

 work in factories and 2 work at the   
 newly opened Selby coalfield.In the   
 women 11 work as housewives,3 work for
 a business,1 works for the community  
 and 1 works in a pub.                 
   2 people we asked leave for work    
 between 6-7am,6 leave between 7-8am,5 
 leave between 8-9am,2 work on shifts  
 and 2 leave at other times.We asked
