		<title>14TRANSPORT-DUNTON GREEN AREA</title>
		<content>{Rail}A line runs through Dunton Green 
 to Charing Cross, another runs through
 Otford to Victoria station,London.    
 They meet at Sevenoaks to the South.  
{Roads}The old London-South coast      
 route(A21) went through D.G.In the    
 mid 60s the Sevenoaks/Tonbridge bypass
 was built and the London road was re- 
 numbered A2028. Heavy traffic was re- 
 duced. Motorway constructon has taken 
 place since the mid-1970's E-W across 
 the area(M25/M26). The link between   
 the{M25/M26}and A21 will be completed 
 in 1986 and known as the{Chevening    
{ interchange.}It is hoped that by the 
 end of the decade there will be east- 
 facing access(only west-facing access 
 at present). Otford made successful   
 appeals against east-facing access    
 to the Otford road(A225). The Dept. of
 Transport will reconsider those       
 omitted from the Chevening interchange</content>
