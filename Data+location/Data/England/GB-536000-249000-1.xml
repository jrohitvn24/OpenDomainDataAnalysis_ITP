		<content> The main part of the village of       
 Barrington covers approximately one   
 square kilometre. The main street is a
 minor tarmaced road. There is a       
 pathway down the full length of the   
 south side of the street. The notrth  
 side is bordered by the greens - 22   
 acres in size. Barrington is a        
 striking village grouped round the    
 greens. This has been encroached upon 
 by the island of 17th century thatched
 cottages, houses near the church,     
 houses and gardens along the river.   
 Until recently there were traces of   
 earthworks on the green resembling the
 platforms of gardens. All Saints      
 church is a 11-14th century church    
 with a square tower. Several medieaval
 paintings have been uncovered on the  
 walls of the nave.
