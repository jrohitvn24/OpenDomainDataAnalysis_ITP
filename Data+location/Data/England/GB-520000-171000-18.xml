		<title>18Churches in Roehampton Area</title>
		<content>Most churchgoers are Roman Catholics   
whorshipping at St. Joseph's,          
Roehampton Lane; at daily service or in
quiet prayer there. At Parkside there  
is also a chapel holding regular       
sevices at the residence of the Papal  
Nuncio (the Roman Catholic Pope's      
ambassador to this country). St.Paul's 
in Inner Park Rd. and Holy Trinity in  
Ponsonby Rd. are 2 Church of England   
churches serving socially mixed areas  
aiming to make all people welcome. Holy
Trinity is linked to the Methodist     
Church in Minstead Gardens and the two 
congregations work together as an      
Ecumenical Parish sharing their        
resources. Holy Trinity is a typical   
old building whereas the Methodist     
Church is modern and on weekdays used  
as a hall for community projects such  
as mother and baby, and youth groups.  
Holy Trinity is linked to the school.  </content>
