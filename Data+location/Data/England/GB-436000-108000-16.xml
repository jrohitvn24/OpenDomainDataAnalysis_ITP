		<content> The entrance was like a               
 greenhouse.It's red,yellow and blue   
 but part of the red has gone orange   
 where the metal is deteriorating so   
 this part has to be knocked down and  
 rebuilt.                              
       It has a                        
 library,hall,craftroom,drama,needle   
 work,cooking,staffroom,nursing        
 room,headmasters office,classrooms and
 toilets.The hall is double glazed.It  
 has a fan and good P.E. equipment.The 
 drama room can be blacked out.The     
 lighting was good and I liked the     
 shaped windows.                       
       There's a spiral staircase      
 leading to a classroom and a          
 balcony.Children are visible from all 
 parts of the school.Art and craft area
  are outside the classrooms.The       
 building is unusual and full of       
 character.                            </content>
