		<content> Most communications are made by either
 telephone or letter. Modern telephones
 have press-buttons instead of a       
 dial.Most houses and all businesses   
 gave a telephone. The message is      
 carried by wires which are            
 under-ground. The telephone rings when
 someone is trying to contact you.     
 If you want to contact someone by     
 letter, you write your message on a   
 piece of paper,put it in an envelope  
 with a stamp on, and put it in a      
 post-box.The letters are taken away to
 be sorted by a machine. They are then 
 sent on to their destinations. Every  
 house and road has its own post-code. 
 This helps with the sorting, and also 
 helps the postman to deliver the      
 letters to the correct houses.
