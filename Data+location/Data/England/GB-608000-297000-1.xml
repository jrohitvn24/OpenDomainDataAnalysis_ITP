		<content> The landscape is flat with trees and  
 generally quite large fields separated
  by hedges. It is good quality        
 farmland with scattered arable and    
 mixed arable farms. The two small     
 communities Spooner Row (said to have 
 got its name from the Tudor           
 wood-turning industry) and Suton are  
 interdependent. They have several     
 businesses to do with agriculture.    
 The A11 trunk road between Norwich and
 London passes through the area, our   
 section being part of the first       
 turnpike road in the country. Greatly 
 increased traffic due to trade with   
 the EEC countries and the oil and gas 
 industry has put pressure on the route
 and it has been recently improved. The
 main railway line from Norwich to     
 Peterborough, Cambridge and Birmingham
 also passes through the area.
