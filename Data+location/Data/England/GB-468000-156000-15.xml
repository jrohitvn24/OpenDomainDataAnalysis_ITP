 After that it is our play time and    
 then we move to our second "home      
 base." and we might do art or         
 sewing,painting,project, drawing or   
 gluing.After that it is dinner time   
 and we have our dinner.After dinner we
 have another playtime and then we go  
 in for some more lessons.             
 At 5 o'clock I go swimming and so I   
 have to leave at half past 4 as it    
 takes about twenty minutes to get to  
 Basingstoke. Today it is my test and I
 have to swim 10 times round the pool. 
 After my lesson has finished I go and 
 have a Wimpy hamburger and after I    
 have been to the Wimpy Bar we go back 
 to the sports centre and Sonya (My    
 sister) does canoeing. Her lesson     
 takes about an hour and then we go    
 home.
