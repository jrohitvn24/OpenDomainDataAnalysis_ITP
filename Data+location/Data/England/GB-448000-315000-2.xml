		<title>02LEISURE &amp; RECREATION:L'BORO</title>
		<content> Our D.Block has been associated with  
 recreation for  many centuries. Much  
 of the land was once used for royal   
 hunting parks. There are still        
 boundary  ditches and tree lines that 
 show us where the parks were.         
    The results  of a survey that we   
 carried out using people living in our
 D.Block show that the majority of     
 people spent the majority of their    
 leisure time either at home or using  
 the leisure facilities in Loughborough
 or Leicester.                         
    The main leisure activities at home
 include using home computers, watching
 television (from a few hours a week to
 six hours a day),  gardening, reading,
 craft work. Other leisure activities  
 include, sports,  music, visiting     
 friends and relatives, visiting the   
 local pub and cinema, eating out.
