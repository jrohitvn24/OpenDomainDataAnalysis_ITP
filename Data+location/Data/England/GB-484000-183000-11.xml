		<title>11CANNON COURT FARM STABLES.</title>
		<content>   My name is Sascha Edwards. My friend
 Tiffany and I enjoy riding, we have   
 our own ponies, and we stable them at 
 Cannon Court Farm. It is a small farm 
 with only 40 acres, and is situated   
 to the north-west of Maidenhead.      
   The farm has three paddocks, two of 
 them are for the horses, and the other
 one is a jumping paddock. The jumps   
 are set out all through the summer for
 us to practise on. When we go out     
 riding there are lots of bridle paths 
 around the farm that we can use. We   
 can also ride on Cookham Dean Common. 
   The owner, Mr. Lovejoy, also grows  
 and sells potatoes, and hay for the   
 horses. Cannon Court Farm is not a    
 riding stables. The horses that are   
 kept there are owned by local people, 
 we have to pay for the stabling and   
 use of the fields, and we have to look
 after the ponies ourselves.           </content>
