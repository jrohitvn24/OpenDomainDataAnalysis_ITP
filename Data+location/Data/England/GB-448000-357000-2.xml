		<title>02INDUSTRY IN SUTTON IN  A.</title>
		<content>   Sutton has long associations with   
 the hosiery industry,and was involved 
 in the Luddite troubles               
 (machine-breaking) which affected many
 parts of Notts.in the early 19th C.   
   In the mid 1980s {hosiery}and{      
{clothing manufacture}are still the    
 main industries in the area,and       
 provide job opportunities-especially  
 for women-both full and part-time.    
   Other important industries in the   
 area are tinplate and various light   
 engineering works.There is now only   
 one working coal mine in the area but 
 a number of men are employed in coal  
 mines nearby.                         
   As is to be expected,with an urban  
 area the size of Sutton in Ashfield   
 there are numerous service            
 industries-local                      
 government,banking,estate agencies    
 etc.  MARION ALLAN.                   </content>
