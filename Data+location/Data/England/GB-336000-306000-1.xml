		<content> The area of this block is rural, a    
 wide shallow valley drained by the red
 brook, with the main village of       
 Pontesbury in the south east. The     
 buildings are of brick, with older    
 houses and shops near the church and  
 newer estates on the outskirts. The   
 land, with many farms, is mainly      
 arable, providing pasture for dairy   
 cattle and some sheep, for which      
 fodder crops are also grown. The      
 scenery is undulating with hedges and 
 matured trees, and in the north west  
 are area of deciduous woodland, the   
 largest being quarry woods, which     
 shows evidence of former coppicing. On
 better drained land, above the        
 permanent pasture by the brook, are   
 the hamlets of Westley, Farley and    
 Edge and the village of Asterley, the 
 only settlement apart from Pontesbury 
 to have a church and a pub.           </content>
