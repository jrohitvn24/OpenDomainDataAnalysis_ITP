		<content>   The twelve kilometre block surveyed 
 by our group is a rural area dominated
 by agriculture. It is situated near   
 the south coast with the seaside towns
 of Eastbourne and Seaford being the   
 nearest resorts (approximately 8      
 miles).  The River Cuckmere winds     
 through the south east corner of our  
 area. Only one B road passes through  
 the block and there are very few other
 roads, of the narrow and winding      
 country lane type.  These mainly      
 supply farms and provide access  to   
 the small villages dotted about this  
 region.  The predominant sight which  
 meets one's eyes is that of farmland -
 there is a fairly even distribution of
 both cereal and dairy farms. The most 
 common crop grown within this area is 
 grass.  The main residential area is  
 found towards the East in the small   
 village of Upper Dicker.              </content>
