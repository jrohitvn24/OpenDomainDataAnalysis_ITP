		<title>06Religion in Twyford</title>
		<content> There are two Parish Churches in our  
 block.Twyford church which is one of a
 group of 7 churches making up the Swan
 Group.The Group share 2 ministers who 
 live outside our block.The small      
 church at Godington is in an          
 Oxfordshire Group.Both churches are   
 poorly attended except on special     
 occasions e.g.Christmas,weddings or   
 funerals.Twyford also has a           
 Non-Conformist chapel which shares a  
 minister with other villages.         
 A small number of people attend       
 breakaway churches such as Latterday  
 Saints,Plymouth Bretheren.A small     
 number attend a Catholic church in    
 a nearby town.                        
 We would say almost 100% of the people
 claim to belong to a Christian faith  
 although only a few percent attend    
 church regularly.
