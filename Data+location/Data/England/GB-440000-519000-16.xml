		<title>16STOCKTON -- OUR TOWN.</title>
		<content> The things I like best about Stockton 
 are that there are quite a few clothes
 shops, it's got a good night life,    
 plenty of supermarkets and The Green  
 Dragon Yard Museum which tells us much
 about the history of Stockton. Many   
 older streets have been modernised.   
 There is a nice town hall in the      
 centre with The Shambles market. There
 is a large shopping precinct, plenty  
 of banks and building societies. There
 are pool clubs and amusements for     
 young and old. However there is not   
 enough night life for teenagers unlike
 nearby Billingham. There are lots of  
 parks to go to but there are always   
 skinheads gluesniffing. I don't like  
 the running fights through the town   
 between skinheads and Joeys. There are
 not many sports facilities. There is  
 an annual regatta and folklore        
 festival and Chrismas tree and lights.</content>
