		<content> A daily{postal service}operates for   
 the delivery letters and parcels from 
 Mondays to Saturdays. Collections are 
 made from the post office at          
 Rhydycroesau each morning and after-  
 noon from Monday to Friday and also on
 Saturday mornings. There is no Sunday 
 service.There are three roadside{     
{letter boxes}from which letters are   
 collected daily - one is at Pant Glas 
 and the others are at points beside   
 the Oswestry to Llansilin road. The   
{telephone}saves much travelling time  
 in a country area and is a vital link 
 for remoter cottages which may be cut 
 off for several days by heavy snow-   
 falls in winter. Public{telephone     
{kiosks}are located at Rhydycroesau and
 Pant Glas. They are of the old design 
 with small glass panes, unlike many   
 elsewhere in the country which are    
 being replaced by modern designs.     </content>
