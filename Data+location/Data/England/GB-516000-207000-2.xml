		<content> The majority of the houses within the 
 area of Jennings Road, Brampton Road  
 and Woodstock Road are Victorian or   
 Edwardian but some date around 1920 to
 1930. The area contains large detached
 Edwardian and Victorian houses priced 
 in the region of Â£100,000 to Â£150,000.
 There are also large semi-detached    
 properties around Â£70,000 and smaller 
 terraced Victorian properties around  
 Â£40,000 to Â£45,000. There are no      
 council houses in the area. The estate
 agent who we spoke to, said that      
 normally, he would expect at least ten
 to twelve houses to be on the market  
 for sale at any one time.
