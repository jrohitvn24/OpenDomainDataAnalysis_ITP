		<content>   The spinning and weaving machines   
 for both wool and cotton were powered 
 by water wheels. The soft stream water
 from the gritstone moors was ideal for
 various finishing processes. For      
 example Cheesden Lumb Mill (built in  
 1786) was a fulling mill where the    
 woollen cloth from the nearby cottage 
 weavers was processed and given a     
 'felted' texture.                     
                                       
   The coming of the industrial        
 revolution and the advent of steam    
 power led to the demise of the textile
 industry in this area. Very few of the
 mills transferred to steam power.
