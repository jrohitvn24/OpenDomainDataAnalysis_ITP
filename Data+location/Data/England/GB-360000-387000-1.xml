		<title>01WARRINGTON - An Introduction</title>
		<content>                                       
    {Warrington New Town }is situated  
 half-way between the conurbations of  
 Manchester and Liverpool and is       
 surrounded by three Motorways. Two    
 major rail routes pass through the    
 centre and the Manchester Ship Canal  
 is also close to the town. All this   
 has meant that Warrington has         
 developed into a thriving industrial  
 and commercial centre.                
    Warrington itself has a tremendous 
 depth of character, with many historic
 traditions and places successfully    
 merged with up-to-the-minute          
 technology.                           
    It is extremely difficult to       
 isolate a small number of topics to   
 represent such a variety of 'faces'   
 but we hope that the areas chosen give
 some indication of Warrington,1985
