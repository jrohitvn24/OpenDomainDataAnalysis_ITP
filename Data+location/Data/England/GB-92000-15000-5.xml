		<title>05MEDICAL CHECKS ON ST.MARTINS</title>
		<content>    Within  the islands we have one    
 dentist and he has a small surgery in 
 the Health Centre on the main island, 
 complete with dentists chair and      
 surgical equipment.Therefore a boat   
 trip is necessary before treatment can
 begin.However he vists our school once
 a year in the summer term, to check   
 our mouthes for gum and tooth         
 disorders.An optician from the        
 mainland visits four times a year and 
 you go to St.Marys for your test.The  
 audiologist also comes four times a   
 year.You have your test at St.Marys   
 Health Centre,unless there are a lot  
 of children needing to be tested on   
 the smaller off islands.In that case  
 she visits them in their schools.Maybe
 it is a disadvantage to cross four    
 kilometres of water for medical       
 checks,but we do not have long waiting
 lists.                                </content>
