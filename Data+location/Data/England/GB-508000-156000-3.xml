		<content> Most of the inhabitants of the area   
 except those involved in farming  in  
 the rural areas either{commute}daily  
 into the city of London where they are
 mainly employed as buisness-men for   
 one of the large oil companies        
                                       
               {OR                     
{                                      
 teach at one of the{schools}in the    
 surrounding area (comprehensives and  
 public schools)                       
                                       
 Recently a Computer firm (Logica) have
 moved into the area and have begun    
 employing local people.               
 However, the bulk of their employees  
 come from outside the area.           
                                       
 There is very little unemployment     
 within this area.
