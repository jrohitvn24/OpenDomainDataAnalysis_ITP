 1783. There was a plentiful supply of 
 water from the River Hiz and ample    
{sheepskins}from the flocks kept on the
 nearby Chiltern Hills. Nowadays 50% of
 the sheepskins are bought in the U.K. 
 and 50% from New Zealand. Today the   
 sheepskins are split in two by        
 machinery.  The bottom or inner half  
 is the{flescher.} This is tanned with 
 cod liver oil to become{chamois       
 leather: 50% of which is exported to  
 the U.S.A. The top half or outside is 
 vegetable tanned to make{pickled      
{grain leather. Goatskins}are imported 
 from Nigeria to make{Oasis Goat       
{Leather}to be used for expensive book 
 binding.{Lambskins}are used to make   
{suede.}

 exporting to 75 countries.
