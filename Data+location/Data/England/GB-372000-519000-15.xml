		<title>15SCHOOLS</title>
		<content>    The primary school closed some 15  
 years ago and the building is now used
 as a field study centre by colleges of
 education.  All children travel into  
 Appleby for education by the daily    
 school bus. Of course, there are times
 in the winter when this cannot get    
 through or days when the children are 
 sent home early from school when heavy
 snow is falling. Winter weather is    
 eagerly watched by local children!    
     Ironically for the closed school  
 there are now sufficient children in  
 the villages to have warranted it     
 staying open, and the Sunday School is
 well-attended. This is also an        
 indication that the local population  
 is not an ageing one.                 
    Secondary education is at the local
 comprehensive, Appleby Grammar School,
 further education in Kendal or        
 Carlisle.                             </content>
