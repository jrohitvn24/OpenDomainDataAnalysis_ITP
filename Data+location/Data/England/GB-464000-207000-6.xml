		<content> I wake up at 5:45am and get dressed.  
 Outside there is an old shed with     
 glass doors.I get on my Extra Burner  
 and ride to my Grandads farm where I  
 meet my Grandad.First we feed 18      
 calves with Bibby powdered milk. Then 
 I untie the dog and she jumps into the
 Landrover so we go up the road to the 
 other farm where we fill the cake bags
 up with cow cake.Next we go to the    
 fields and my Grandad stands on the   
 tailboard with a bag in his hands so  
 I get in the drivers seat, so the cake
 pours out.Next we go back to the farm 
 and bed up with 2 big bails of straw. 
 The Manitou lifts them into the barn. 
 After that we have breakfast which    
 consists of one egg and four slices of
 toast.After that we go home and make  
 sandwiches. Then we collect our       
 fishing tackle and walk to the bus    
 stop where we meet Charles and Jason. </content>
