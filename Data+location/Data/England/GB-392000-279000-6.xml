		<content> On our day out we used the afternoon  
 to use the questionnaires we had made.
                                       
 This is a summary of what we found out
 from ordinary people:_                
                                       
 The farmer we asked knew a lot about  
 the area. He had lived here a long    
 time.                                 
 One lady was very kind, she gave us a 
 drink. She had a swimming pool in her 
 garden.                               
 A man we asked said he enjoyed        
 gardening. He sounded posh. Lots of   
 houses there had big gardens.         
 All of the people we asked said there 
 was no violence in Romsley.           
 One woman said she had lived in       
 Romsley for 26 years, which is a long 
 time.                                 
                                       
                                       </content>
