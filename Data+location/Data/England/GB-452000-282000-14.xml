		<title>14TEENAGER'S AMBITIONS</title>
		<content>      We asked 100 14 year olds about  
 their{ambitions.} There were 2 types  
 of ambitions -{fantasy}and{career.} 60
 wanted to be either a millionaire or a
 pop star, 30 wanted to be a member of 
 the Royal Family and 20 wanted to be  
 the Prime Minister.                   
                                       
      Career ambitions were different  
 for boys and girls.  All the boys     
 wanted to be either rich or famous or 
 both through their career.  Football  
 player and record producer were       
 popular choices.  For girls           
 hairdresser, teacher and riding       
 instructress were popular.            
                                       
     All but 2 of the 14 year olds     
 asked wanted to be married by the time
 they were 25.
