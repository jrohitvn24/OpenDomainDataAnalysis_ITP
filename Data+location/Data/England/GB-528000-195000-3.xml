		<title>03Housing in Western Enfield</title>
		<content>  The council owns approximately 8000  
 flats,houses and bungalows in the     
 Western part of Enfield.The rapid     
 spread of housing did not continue    
 after the Second World War,owing to   
 the existence of more effective       
 planning controls and the Metropolitan
 Green Belt.                           
  We did a housing survey and found    
 that in the Cockfosters,Oakwood and   
 Grange Park areas the housing is      
 mainly semi-detached.Near Cockfosters 
 staion there are many maisonettes.    
 There is also a council Estate at     
 Coverack Close on which there is      
 terraced housing and high rise flats. 
 In Grange Park there are a few        
 terraces,maisonettes and detached     
 houses.                               
  In the Ridgeway area there are more  
 semi-detached houses than else where.
