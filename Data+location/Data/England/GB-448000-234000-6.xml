		<content>     The Baptist Church is not nearly  
 as old as the Parish Church, but it is
 an attractive stone building in Wales 
 Street.   The Minister lives in the   
 village and the Baptists help to run  
 several village activities.           
     There are two Services on Sunday: 
                                       
     10.30am   Family Worship &amp; Junior 
                                Church 
               A creche is provided and
               coffee is served after  
               the service.            
      6.00pm   Evening Worship         
                                       
    Each month two of the services     
 include Communion.                    
    On Tuesday afternoons ladies from  
 other churches join in an ecumenical  
 meeting.   On Thursday evenings there 
 is a Prayer and Bible Study Meeting in
 someone's house.                      </content>
