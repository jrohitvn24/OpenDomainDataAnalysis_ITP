		<title>12HOTELS IN HORLEY</title>
		<content>  In our area there are 2 small private
{hotels}and 1 large one in an          
 international chain, this one has 333 
 bedrooms, mainly single but there is  
 some family accommodation. These      
 hotels cater mainly for people using  
 Gatwick Airport,and are used          
 for overnight stays rather than for   
 holiday  purposes. This also means    
 that they are used to a large extent  
 by foreigners. The large hotel is     
 actually attached to the airport      
 complex, so is easily reached from the
 terminal buildings. It is also used by
 Business companies for dinners,       
 meetings, conferences and exhibitions.
 There are also shops, and a leisure   
 centre there. Of the 2 smaller hotels,
 one is in a very rural area and also  
 hold discos and caters for weddings.  
 It has large lawns and a lake and the 
 building is very old.                 </content>
