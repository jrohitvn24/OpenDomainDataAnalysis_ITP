  A 4 1/2 acre area of damp woodland   
known as Fen Alder Carr was bought by  
the Suffolk County Council in 1980 as  
part of the Gipping Valley Countryside 
and Recreation Project, and was opened 
to the public soon after as a nature   
reserve.                               
  A wooden walkway winds between       
willows, alders, ash and field maples  
and throughout lies a dense carpet of  
herbs including meadowsweet, willow    
herb and angelica.  There are many     
interesting plants, which include marsh
marigolds, bitter sweet, ramsons, wild 
arum and water crowfoot.  Fungi grow on
mossy stumps and further on, a pond    
provides a breeding ground for toads,  
damsel flies and water insects.        
  It is a natural habitat for birds.   
  The reserve is maintained by the     
Manpower Services Commission.          </content>
