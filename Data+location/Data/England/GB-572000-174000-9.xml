		<title>09My School Year -Autumn Term</title>
		<content>I started my school year in September  
in class 2. Mrs.Brown is the class     
teacher.In October we started ice      
skating,which was good,then something  
special happened.We were asked to the  
Ice Gala in Gillingham and we saw the  
Queen,the Duke of Edinburgh and some   
famous skaters.On October 31st we had a
Hallowe'en Party and in November we    
planted a woodland and our photo went  
in the paper.Our topic for the first   
term was the Arabs,and time and tune   
was Hansel and Gretel and we watched   
Badger Girl on television.At Christmas 
we dressed as children from around the 
world for our concert and we had a     
party with lots of food.Mrs.Rosa, one  
of our teachers, retired and when we   
gave her some presents we were all sad.
