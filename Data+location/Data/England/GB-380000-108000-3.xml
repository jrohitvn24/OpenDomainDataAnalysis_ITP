		<content> This area is rural with large areas of
 unspoilt countryside, particularly on 
 the hills where farming is difficult. 
 There are many footpaths, some of     
 which require attention as they have  
 become overgrown in recent years.     
 There are also many small streams     
 running through the area, which       
 support a variety of wildlife.        
 Both the flora and fauna of the area  
 are worthy of study.                  
                                       
 Within the villages, there is a       
 certain amount of concern over heavy  
 traffic and vehicles of all types     
 travelling at too great a speed for   
 safety. Another cause for complaint is
 the smells from farms and poultry     
 units.  Generally, however, the local 
 residents regard it as a healthy and  
 peaceful place to live.
