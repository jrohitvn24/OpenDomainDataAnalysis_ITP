		<title>11MOTTINGHAM WEEK</title>
		<content>   On Saturday 8th June it was the     
first day of Mottingham Week.We have a 
festival every 2 years there is a fete 
and a carnival.The fete was at the     
playing fields.                        
   {The Carnival} came at 2.30.There   
were many fascinating floats and       
lorries with colourful people.The theme
was Â£Past and Present'.Our float was an
Edwardian school.Our head, Mrs. Swallow
was the teacher with a straw hat,a pair
of glasses,a cane and a long skirt.The 
children sat in rows dressed in aprons,
dresses and ribbons for the girls and  
trousers and caps for the boys.Kieron  
was the dunce with the pointed hat with
the big D on the front.All the other   
floats were also good with characers   
such as clowns,Indians and army forces.
The majorettes were marching and the   
scouts and karate were following too.
