		<title>07    MY DAY ON THE FARM</title>
		<content> I start my day on the{farm}by helping 
 my dad get the cows in for{milking}.  
 After the cows have been milked, we   
 put them back in the field. The grass 
 in the field feeds the cows so they   
 give more milk.After dad and I have   
 put the cows out,we go to our other   
 farm and feed the young stock.We feed 
 them on hay and calf nuts and give    
 them water to drink.We then go back to
 the farm to muck out the stables and  
 wash them out so they are clean for   
 the cows to come back in for milking. 
 Our cows have to be milked twice a    
 day. Once in the morning and once in  
 the evening. We also have a{bull}but  
 my dad does him because I am not      
 strong enough to cope with him yet.   
 When all the work on the farm is done,
 I can go to bed.My farm is called La  
 Fontenelle. By{Adam Le Lacheur.
