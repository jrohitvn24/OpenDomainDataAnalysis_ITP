		<content> Before crops can be grown the earth is
 tested for it's lime content. Barley  
 and rape need a lot of lime but wheat 
 and potatoes not so much. If the soil 
 needs more lime it is sprayed on the  
 ground as granules. They're put in a  
 hopper. Because the soil is heavy a   
 flat lift is used.This goes deeper    
 than a plough and lifts and lightens  
 the earth. It does not turn it over.  
 The pig tail cultivator is taken over 
 a field twice to break up the earth.  
 Fertilizer in liquid is spread over   
 the ground and washed in by the rain. 
 In mid June a spray containing a      
 fungicide and pesticide is  applied   
 from a helicopter. Wheat used for     
 milling, (i.e.for flour and bread) is 
 given a late application  of Nitrogen.
 This increases the protein content of 
 the flour. Then it is combined, dried 
 and stored until it's used.           </content>
