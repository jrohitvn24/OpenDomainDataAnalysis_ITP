		<title>01An introduction to Bexhill</title>
		<content> Bexhill-on-Sea is{positioned}on the   
 S.E. coast of England, and mid-way    
 between Eastbourne to the west and    
 Hastings to the East.  It is located  
 on a spur of sandstone that ends in   
 the sea as a small cliff to the East  
 of the town called Galley Hill, with  
 low floodable marshes to the east     
 (Glynde Gap) and to the west (Pevensey
 Marshes).                             
{Climatically}Bexhill enjoys warm      
 summers (17C July) and mild winters   
 (5C January) due to the maritime      
 influence of the sea.                 
 The{population}of the area is         
 approximately 36000 with a pronounced 
 age imbalance, the average age being  
 66.  Bexhill is essentially a{tourist 
{and retirement centre,}and derives    
 most of its wealth from these. There  
 is a little light industry and local  
 government offices for Rother District</content>
