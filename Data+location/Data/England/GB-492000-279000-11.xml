  In Grafton Underwood there are not   
many children. Primary aged children go
mainly to Cranford School, but one boy 
aged 11 attended Geddington School. He 
has lived in Grafton Underwood for one 
year and finds it very peaceful. He    
comes to school by car. His favourite  
subject is art. At school he had just  
done some writing about a cricket match
(2nd July 1985). He likes reading      
comics and magazines and enjoys pop    
music. At home he has his own computer.
He has one brother who he says he      
doesn't like. In September he is going 
to Bishop Stopford Secondary School in 
Kettering.
