		<title>04Worship In Walberton</title>
		<content>   There are three places of worship in
 the village, the Baptist chapel and   
 the two oldest buildings in the block 
 _ the village churches of Walberton   
 and Binsted.  The last only has two   
 services a month.  Catholics must     
 travel for a service, usually to      
 Barnham or Slindon.                   
   The Baptist chapel has a good       
 following due to its very popular     
 minister, Ray Geale, the children     
 especially like him.                  
   The village church of St.Mary's     
 usually holds two services on a       
 Sunday, the main service being in the 
 morning.  Congregations vary from     
 about 40 for a normal Sunday to 200   
 (full) on special days. There is a    
 large choir(30+) and a thriving Sunday
 School.
