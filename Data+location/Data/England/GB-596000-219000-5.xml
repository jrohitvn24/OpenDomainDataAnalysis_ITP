		<content> There has been a house on this        
 site since the reign of Henry III     
 (1216_1272). The name of the house    
 comes from a family named Oliver who  
 lived in the reign of Edward I.       
                                       
 The Manor passed through several hands
 and was owned by the Eldred family in 
 the sixteenth and seventeenth         
 centuries.The Eldreds were merchants. 
 In 1720 John Eldred married Susanna   
 Rawstorn of Lexden Manor.David        
 Papillon,a well_known name in         
 Colchester,came to Olivers from Lexden
 Manor in 1968 and lived there until   
 his death in 1979.David Papillon was  
 also descended from the Rawstorns.He  
 laid out the garden in its present    
 form.Future plans for the garden      
 include a meadow area where wild      
 flowers can feed themselves.The       
 present owners are Mr &amp; Mrs D.Edwards.</content>
