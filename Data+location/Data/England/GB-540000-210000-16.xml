		<content> Eastwick School no longer exists as a 
 school; its building is now used for  
 agricultural purposes.                
 Roydon County Primary School still    
 remains in its nineteenth century     
 buildings which have been cleverly    
 modernised. During the period of the  
 great bulge in primary school         
 population during the 1960s addition- 
 al temporary hutted classrooms were   
 built in the grounds and these still  
 exist. This school is just out of our 
 area, however.                        
 A temporary school, Springhills County
 Primary, was built in the Little      
 Parndon area to assist over-          
 population of the Little Parndon      
 County Junior and Infants schools     
 during the bulge decade. Once the
