		<content>   Dilhorne is administered by a Parish
Council of seven elected members of the
village. It meets every third Wednesday
of each month in Dilhorne School.      
                                       
   There is no policeman or house in   
the village, petrols come from Cheadle.
   For Doctors and their surgeries you 
would have to visit Cheadle or Blythe  
Bridge. Likewise all entertainment,such
as cinema's would be found in the      
Potteries.                             
                                       
  The Foxfield Coalmine closed in 1967 
but its mineral line railway has now   
been turned into a Steam Railway by    
local enthusiasts.Much of this lineis  
to be found in this area but its HQ    
comes under Blythe Bridge.             
                                       
  Secondary Education takes place in
