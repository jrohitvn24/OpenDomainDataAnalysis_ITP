		<title>20YARWELL DISUSED QUARRY</title>
		<content>  Yarwell quarry occupies land which   
 was formerly used for arable farming  
 and is situated near Old Sulehay      
 Forest. The quarry was opened in 1938 
 to provide limestone for the building 
 of airfield runways and roads and by  
 1983 the stone was worked out and the 
 quarry closed.                        
  There are two proposals for the      
 future use of the land:               
  The first is that the land should be 
 used for a motocross circuit but this 
 is opposed by local residents on      
 grounds of noise, dust and increasd   
 traffic on local roads.               
  The other proposal which is supported
 by residents is that the quarry should
 become a nature reserve in conjunction
 with the adjoining woodland which is  
 already protected by a preservation   
 order.                                
                                       </content>
