		<content> In school we are interested in caring 
 for our environment.In 1981 The Men Of
 The Trees planted 10 rowan and        
 whitebeam trees to replace dead elm   
 trees.We have set aside part of our   
 grounds for an environmental area. In 
 1984 we joined the Devon Tree Bank    
 scheme.In the Autumn we dug a 3m      
 square and each child planted a row   
 of seeds that they had collected.     
 The seeds are germinating now.We are  
 also growing some saplings in a 1m    
 square.These were brought from another
 school by the Tree Bank Co-ordinator. 
 She also gave us some saplings for a  
 hedge.In March we created a pond which
 we have already started to plant.We   
 hope to encourage many more pond      
 plants and creatures.We are leaving an
 area of long grass to provide habitat 
 for these creatures.
