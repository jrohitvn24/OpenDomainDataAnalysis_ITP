		<content>  Our area owes much to the industrial 
 revolution of the late eighteenth     
 century and early nineteenth century  
 for its development.By 1820,about two 
 dozen large woollen textile mills were
 located around the valley of the River
 Calder,in our area of the Domesday    
 survey.Many of the buildings          
 remain,although the textile boom has  
 long since ended.The old buildings are
 now used by newer industries.South    
 Osset is remarkable for having        
 developed a unique part of the textile
 trade-shoddy and mungo- which involves
 recycling small cloth rags.           
  The industrial landscape of the area 
 is tempered by the abundance of rich  
 agricultural land,dominated by mixed  
 arable farms.These do much to give the
 appearance of a semi-rural landscape.
