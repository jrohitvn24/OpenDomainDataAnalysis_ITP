		<content>  Hensington Farm, Shipton Slade Farm  
and Weavely Farm are all run by Mr     
Brooks. Most of his land is rented from
the Duke of Marlborough. He keeps      
cattle and sheep and grows wheat,      
oilseed rape and barley.               
  Weavely Farm is owned by Mrs         
Clothier's daughters. They own 43 acres
and have 30 Jersey cows, 14 for milking
together with 12 beef cattle and four  
calves. They have 150 semi free-range  
chickens. They get 120 litres of milk a
day and send the cream to a creamery in
Long Handborough. They grow 10-acres of
barley and apart from their one tractor
and milking parlour they have no       
machinery. Other machines are obtained 
though contract hire. They have two    
cats  and used to run a tea room at    
the farm.  On these farms can be found 
some of the local wildlife including,  
mink, hedgehogs, hares, otters and mice</content>
