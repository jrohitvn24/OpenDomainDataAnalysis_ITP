 Gaulden Manor, in Tolland, is a 17th  
 century manor house with unusual      
 plaster ceilings and a fine           
 fire-place. The whole house has a     
 slightly odd plan.It has a room behind
 the hall fireplace.                   
                                       
 Romantic traditions suggest that it   
 was the retreat of the deprived Marian
 Bishop of Exeter, James Turberville,  
 and that it was also the home of the  
 Woolcotts who were later to settle in 
 America. These suggestions have no    
 basis in fact although the Woolcotts  
 certainly lived on the estate.
