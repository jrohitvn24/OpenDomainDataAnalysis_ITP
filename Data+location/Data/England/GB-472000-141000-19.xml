		<title>19FROYLE POSTMASTER'S DAY</title>
		<content> My first job of the day is to {deliver
{milk}to Yarnhams cottages.            
 Once this is done the next job is to  
 check off the morning deliveries.     
                                       
 After this all working surfaces are   
 cleaned.                              
                                       
 The next job is ordering the day's{   
{vegetables. }This is done with an     
 amount of guesswork considering items 
 such as lettuce will only sell whilst 
 weather is warm.                      
                                       
 Serving customers and Post Office form
 filling fills the rest of the day.    
 The{Post Office}work accounts for     
 abput half of my time in the shop.  At
 the end of the day I cash up the tills
 and finish the bookwork.  Lastly I    
 visit the cash and carry and purchase 
 the stock required for the next week. </content>
