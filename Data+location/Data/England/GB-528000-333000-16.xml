		<title>16ANGEL INN STORY</title>
		<content> Mr. Alec Chater took our class around 
 the village he showed us the" Angel   
 Inn".                                 
 Soon after that day Mr. Chater wrote a
 story about the Inn here is a excerpt 
 from his story.Beth happened to knock 
 against a man as she busied herself   
 seeing to the wants of the  new       
 arrivals." FOOLISH GIRL!" He          
 exclaimed,as he aimed a fist at       
 her.The blow was well-aimed,and sent  
 Beth reeling into a group of          
 drinkers,who merely shoved her away   
 without a second thought.Only the     
 mysterious figure seemed to notice    
 this incident.As if on a slowly moving
 chain, his head raised,and eyes,first 
 in deep shadow,became pulsating slits 
 of light.The upward movement of the   
 head was followed by the whole body   
 becoming erect:a body that towered    
 above everyone else.                  </content>
