		<title>17GOING TO SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Every morning my mother wakes me up   
 and then I go down stairs to get ready
 for school. I have breakfast, get     
 dressed, clean my teeth and put my    
 shoes on then have to wait on the step
 for a lift to school. When I get      
 there we have to wait until the bell  
 goes then we go in to our classrooms. 
 We have assembly and then do maths    
 until break time at 10.35 a.m. When   
 we come in after break we usually do  
 some English work until dinner.       
 Now there are less children than a    
 year ago we can all go into one       
 sitting for dinner. When we have      
 finished we go out to play until 1.30.
 We then go in and work until last     
 break. We usually do more interesting 
 things then such as drawing or making 
 things .
