		<title>03HILL FARMING ON THE PENNINES</title>
		<content> Three farms were visited, all of them 
 being over 1,000 feet above sea level.
 Lower Drake Hill is a beef, sheep, and
 arable farm of 500 acres carrying 600 
 sheep and 240 beef cattle. Barley is  
 bought in, turnips are grown, and     
 silage is made from the grass to feed 
 the animals in winter. Four full time 
 workers are employed.                 
   Woodroyd Hill is a dairy farm       
 typical of this area with 80 milk cows
 and 80 sheep on 285 acres. Silage is  
 made and potatoes, swede and barley   
 grown. There are two workers here.    
    Dick Edge Farm is the smallest; it 
 has only 38 acres. 17 acres are used  
 for the 17 milking cows. Silage,      
 potatoes and turnips are grown and    
 two people are employed.              
 The two large farms had a lot of      
 machinery which was important for     
 getting the work done.                </content>
