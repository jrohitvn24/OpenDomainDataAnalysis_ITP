		<title>01Hury In Baldersdale</title>
		<content> The block covers an area lying between
 180m and 400m.   The higher parts are 
 used for grazing sheep and shooting   
 grouse.   The lower enclosed land has 
 numerous small farms not exceeding 200
 acres each.   Mainly Friesian cows for
 milk (northern dairy shorthorn cows   
 are now rarely seen).   Charolais     
 cross bred beasts brought on for fat  
 stock.   Sheep run on open moor       
 (stinted).   Farm life hard.   Labour 
 costs high hence long hours for owners
 or tenants.   Cold winters and high   
 rainfall make hay crops difficult     
 hence trend to silage.   Hamlets at   
 Hury and Hunderthwaite.   Some        
 abandoned buildings and 2 public      
 houses show a decline in rural        
 population.   Hury reservoir is public
 water supply.   Used for fishing      
 perch, brown and rainbow trout.       
 Canadian and brent geese sometimes    </content>
