		<content> The small Anglican Church at          
 Cressbrook has only one service each  
 month with an average attendance of   
 approximately ten people. There is    
 a small cemetery in a field near      
 Cressbrook village.                   
 The small Anglican Church at Wardlow  
 dedicated to The Good Shepherd has a  
 service twice a month attended by     
 approximately nine people.            
 The Vicar of Tideswell gives pastoral 
 care to the two communities.          
 The Methodist Chapel at Cressbrook    
 was closed for worship ten years ago  
 and since then, the Methodists in the 
 area go to Litton Chapel.
