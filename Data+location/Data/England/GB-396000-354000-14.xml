		<title>14NORMID SUPERMARKET LEEK</title>
		<content>June 1st 1984 a huge new supermarket,  
Normid of Leek was opened.The land was 
cleared of factories and shops         
including an old cobblers."Normid"     
comes from North Midlands Co-operative 
and replaced the old store on the High 
Street.                                
Many people poured through the doors   
the day it was opened,not many bought  
anything but simply walked around to   
see what it was like.I think the man   
who designed the building should be    
thanked for making our town a better   
place.It has got electric doors and    
moving floors to the car park.It has   
brought many people into the town and  
therefor it is bringing money into     
Leek.                                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
