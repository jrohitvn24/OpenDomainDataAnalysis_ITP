		<content>{The }estate of Windsor Great Park     
 employs 300 people and they have a    
 variety of jobs.Some of which were    
 gardeners, feeders of the deer, people
 in the office etc.                    
{There}are 6000 acres of the Great Park
 5000 of them are open to the public . 
 Mr. Wiseman the estate manager said   
 that Dukes Lane was named after a real
 Duke.Sandpit gate was built in 1820   
 and it was called Sandpit because     
 there was a hill where the villagers  
 got sand .Mr. Wiseman said that it was
 made of wood and it had been changed  
 through the years .I asked him why    
 was the Isle of Wight pond called     
 that.He said because it was shaped    
 like the Isle of Wight .
