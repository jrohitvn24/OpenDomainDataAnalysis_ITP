		<content> Here is one of the more interesting   
 articles from the Tring and District  
 Gazette dated Friday June 7th 1985.   
 The title is"School  hit by mystery   
 gas blaze."                           
 A Tring Head Teacher said her school  
 was very very lucky to escape major   
 damage from a blaze on Thursday last  
 week.                                 
 The cylinder part of a roofing        
 contractor's equipment, could have    
 become a lethal bomb, a fireman said  
 later."That whole side of the school  
 would have gone if it had exploded,"  
 he added.Fire tenders from Tring and  
 Berkhamsted rushed to the school after
 nearby residents raised the alarm at  
 about 8.30p.m.                        
 Firemen said that a gas_fired         
 tar_melting heater had caught fire and
 the heat had set off its supply
