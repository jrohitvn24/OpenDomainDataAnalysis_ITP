		<title>17MOTSPUR PARK BRANCH LINE</title>
		<content> This 4.5_mile branch is less than half
 of the planned Leatherhead Loop, &amp; has
 the sad double distinction of being   
 the last stretch of surface railway to
 be built in Britain, &amp; of being aban_ 
 doned because of{World War II.}       
   {Constructed by}Southern Railways{  
{before the days of nationalisation,   
{the line was meant to 'cash in' on the
{suburban expansion envisaged after the
{opening of the}Kingston By_Pass.{     
{  }The line opened on May 28, 1939, &amp; 
 its 'modern' feel was encapsulated by 
 the avant_garde design of the station 
 shelters.                             
   {Beyond Chessington South station,  
{the line runs as far as the coaling   
{yard.  After that, another 33 chains  
{distance is all that exists of the    
{track, though the embankment extends }
{past the 14_mile sign (from}WATERLOO).
