The majority of residents of Cowlinge  
and Little Bradley belong to the Church
of England. Two Roman Catholic families
travel to a neighbouring village to    
attend church. The methodist chapels   
had large congregations in 1850 when   
the built but they are now closed due  
to decreasing attendances. One has been
converted into a house the other into a
warehouse. Cowlinge church is of Saxon 
origins. The rector sreves three       
parishes without a curate and is       
dependant on lay-readers to help with  
services. Religion does not play a     
major part in many peoples lives but   
the chrch is well attended for the     
celebration of Christmas, Easter etc.  
The tiny Saxon church at Little Bradley
has one service each Sunday which is   
well attended.
