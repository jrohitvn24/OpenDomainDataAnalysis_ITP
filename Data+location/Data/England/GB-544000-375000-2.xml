		<content>{THE ALFORD TUESDAY MARKET             
 In twelve eighty three Alford had a   
 charter to say they could have a      
 market every Tuesday. On the          
 eighteenth of June{1985}we went down  
 to the market and found out a few     
 things... There were{35 stalls}ranging
 from food to hosiery and clothes.     
 There were a few plants and           
 greengrocery stalls, some clothes and 
 material stalls and some household    
 spares stalls. The man who has been   
 there the longest is called Mr        
 E.A.Copping. He has been there for{51 
{years.}He sells material and linen. He
 liked it during the  second world war 
 because the RAF used to be there. He  
 says the rent per stall has gone up.  
 It used to be{one shilling}but now it 
 is{six pounds.}The stalls used to be  
 made of{wood,}but now they are made of
{wood and metal.                       </content>
