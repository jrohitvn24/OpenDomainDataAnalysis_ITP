		<content>                                       
 At the top_most, north_westerly       
 corner of the Ragdale area in         
 North_east Leicestershire lies the    
 area known as Six Hills.  This name is
 a corruption of an older name,        
 Seggs_hill or Segshill, and the real  
 meaning of the place name is the high 
 ground where seggs were kept.  Segg   
 was a local name for sheep.           
                                       
                                       
 The Durham Ox Inn is a large public   
 house with limited accommodation.  It 
 is situated at Six Hills at the       
 intersection of the A46 Trunk Road    
 between Leicester and Newark _ the    
 Roman Fosse Road _ and the B676       
 Loughborough to Melton Road.  The     
 Durham Ox was formerly an old coaching
 inn.
