		<content>   Lytham St.Annes{"Jewel of the Fylde 
{Coast."}This is what the brochures    
 claim to be a clear description of the
 town.Pictures show that Lytham has a  
 beach which is the perfect place to   
 sunbathe.It may have been in the      
 past,but now it is just an            
 unattractive area consisting of{      
{Spartina townsendii,}debris,seaweed   
 and mud.There is no trace of a sandy  
 beach.Reclamation and finance is      
 essential.                            
   However, Lytham Green does offer    
 facilities for picnickers and         
 sunbathers where children can play,but
 even that is wearing away and becoming
 brown in patches and will continue to 
 do so if neglected.                   
   The town centre of Lytham offers a  
 wide range of shops.However ,some     
 Lythamers do feel that there is a need
 for a{"Chain Store"}(Marks &amp; Spencers)</content>
