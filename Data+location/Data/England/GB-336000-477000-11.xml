 The Primary School - some traditions. 
 During the year there are several     
 events which take place in school and 
 in and around Cartmel.                
 In October the Harvest Festival is    
 held in the Priory Church.  We        
 decorate the font as part of our      
 thanksgiving service.  In 1985 our    
 theme was bees so we made pictures and
 models of bees and honeycombs.        
 Living in the countryside we like to  
 keep our surroundings beautiful.  In  
 November 1985 we planted a silver     
 birch tree in the school grounds.  We 
 hope to do something like this each   
 year.                                 
 On the last day of summer term we     
 climb up Hampsfell and have a school  
 pic-nic by the hospice. We play games 
 and fly kites. {Sarah Southworth  10  </content>
