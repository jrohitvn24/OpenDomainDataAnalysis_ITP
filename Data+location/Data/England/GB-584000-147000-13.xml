		<content> Quite a lot of locals come and buy    
 fruit to freeze or to use straight    
 away.In early Autumn farmers employ   
 pickers who come every working day to 
 pick the apples and cherries from the 
 orchards.Small-holding owners emloy   
 locals to pick tomatoes,red currants, 
 black currants,lettuces and other     
 fruit and vegetables that they grow.  
    My father owns Stone Hall and      
 Friday street farm.We own about{400 } 
 acres of land.We don't have{Dairy     
{cattle}we have{Beef cattle.}We have 6 
 tractors between the two farms.We     
 employ plenty of men and women when   
 we are strawberry and apple           
 picking.There is a lot of farm        
{machinery}going up and down the lane. 
 Around here it is good for farmers    
 because the ground is fertile and we  
 are not very far from London.
