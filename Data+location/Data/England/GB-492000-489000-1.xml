		<title>01Hills around Langdale End</title>
		<content> Varied scenery of steep sided flat    
 topped hills. The valleys have a      
 mixture of farms and the upper slopes 
 of the hills are generally coverd in  
 confiers with some deciduous woodland 
 in the valleys. Often the tops of the 
 hills are almost flat and formed,     
 which is unseen from the valleys.     
 Becauseof the variety of landscape and
 the hills, the scenery is very        
 pleasant and thus much visited by     
 tourists. There are a couple of minor 
 roads for day trips and several       
 footpaths for walkers. Thre are a     
 scattering of forms and two small     
 villages. Langdale End and Broxa which
 are both predominantly farming        
 communities. Most residents appear to 
 be involved in farming.
