   Kirdford Growers is a fruit storage 
 and distribution plant run as a       
 co-operative.The business has been in 
 existance for 62-64 years. The        
 business was started in a cow shed by 
 five farmers. They sent up several    
 hundred apples to Covent Garden for   
 sale. The people who bought the apples
 were pleased with the quality and     
 asked where the apples had come from, 
 so the farmers set up in business.    
 There are 98 employees there now. They
 come from the surrounding area.       
   A convoy of lorries arrives at the  
 site carrying loads of apples         
 from the farms.When the fruit arrives 
 at the plant it is washed,sorted and  
 graded into different sizes. Then they
 are packed into boxes ready for       
 storage or delivery.
