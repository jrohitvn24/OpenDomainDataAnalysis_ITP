		<title>06MADELEY STAFFS : HOME LIFE</title>
		<content> Many homes in the area are families   
with children.Wives tend to have jobs: 
most part-time,a few full-time &amp; a few 
self-employed.Usually husbands &amp; older 
children share the chores,&amp; home-life  
benefits.Few wives admit to any strain.
All agree that modern homes are easy to
run with the help of automatic washers,
tumble-dryers,freezers,pressure-cookers
perhaps,dish washers &amp; micro-wave ovens
They still do most of the cooking &amp; all
the ironing,usually left until evening.
Most women are well organised,specially
over menus,often planning up to 2 weeks
ahead.Daily shopping is rare except for
older women.It is a family expedition, 
undertaken weekly-even fortnightly.So  
choice of foods &amp; drink is made at the 
shelf.Families are more health &amp; weight
conscious,eat more fibre &amp; less fat.But
convenience foods make life easy.Baked 
beans &amp; ice-cream accompany the bran.  </content>
