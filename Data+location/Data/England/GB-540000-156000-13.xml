THE MOVING CHURCH                      
                                       
The Reverend Vivian Symons owned Saint 
Marks Church, it was a poor shabby iron
building. In those days only a few     
people used it, but Biggin Hill had    
grown and spread and a larger Church   
was needed. A new stone Church would   
cost thousands and thousands of pounds.
Mr.Symons thought he could not possibly
collect all that, but he did not give  
up hope. One day he would build a new  
Church at Biggin Hill. Then he heard of
a Church in London that was going to be
taken down, so he asked if he could    
move the Church that was in Peckham    
to Biggin Hill and he was allowed.     
He started to move it brick by brick   
and in 1959 it was finished.
