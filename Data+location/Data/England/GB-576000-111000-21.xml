<title>21Tesco Superstore Rebuilt 2010</title>
<content>

The original Tesco built out of brick in the early 80s was demolished at the beginning of 2010 and replaced by a larger steel pre-fabricated building. The new superstore also has an underground car park and access to the store frome here is via a lift or an uphill travelator often found at airports. The new Store is open 24 hours a day except on Sundays when it closes at 4pm. The petrol station is owned an run by Tesco and is one of the cheapest in town. There is an extensive array of goods on offer from large flat screen televisions and computers, garden furniture and camping equipment. The store has a pharmacy and the usual delicatessen and fishmongers as well as in in-store bakery. The cafe is inside the store as opposed to outside with the old Tesco. There are self service checkouts where customers just scan the product as well as staffed checkouts. There is also a photo shop where people can get their camera films processed.   &lt;br />
