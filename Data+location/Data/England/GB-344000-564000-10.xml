		<title>10More Recreational Activities</title>
		<content>      The Pubs are in the local        
 villages with the Robin Hood in       
 Smithfield, the Black Lion in         
 Hethersgill,the Heilk Moon in Scaleby 
 and the Cliff Inn not actually in a   
 village but on the road to Longtown.  
     LADIES the ladies of the area have
 a Women's Institute Group in          
 Hethersgill and Smithfield.These are  
 very popular and provide a range of   
 varied activities and outings.        
      Quite a number of the ladies     
 serve on local committees and it would
 appear that most of the organizing is 
 done by the women of the area.        
      The area is served by three      
 churches, one for each parish but they
 are all served by only the one vicar  
 though each has its own church council
 and although they work together they  
 are fiercly independent.
