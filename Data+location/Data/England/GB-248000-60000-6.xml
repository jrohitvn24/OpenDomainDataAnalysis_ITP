		<title>06A DAY AT PLYM BRIDGE</title>
		<content> I get some of my friends at the       
 weekend and I ask my mum to take me   
 down to Plym Bridge and pick us up    
 about 5:00pm.When we are down there we
 eat some dinner and walk up the river 
 and  try to catch some grass snakes or
 some fish.Once we caught a smooth     
 snake.And sometimes we get to where   
 you see old trains.The trains are old 
 steam trains.Some people are painting 
 them and making them better.They are  
 making new tracks.They say they will  
 try to make the track run up to       
 Yelverton.They call it the Plym Valley
 Railway.Some times we walk from       
 Glenholt Woods to Plym Bridge         
 Wood.Twice I have seen deer.Once I saw
 a deer called the scotch white and an 
 old man told me that you could find   
 the deer's old antlers there.The first
 time I saw deer I thought they were   
 wild dogs.                            </content>
