		<title>17Shopping in Scarborough</title>
		<content> There have been many developments and 
 changes to the shopping facilities    
 over the past ten years. The main     
 street and town centre is now         
 dominated by banks, building societies
 shoe shops and large multiples like   
 Marks and Spencer. Local shops        
 have tended to move to the side       
 streets. The increasing traffic,      
 especially in the height of the summer
 season, makes parking difficult near  
 the town centre, and the recent change
 in the flow of traffic because of the 
 new pedestrian precinct has not       
 improved this problem. There is one   
 large multi-storey car park but it is 
 difficult to get out of on busy days. 
 Local people tend to get very         
 flustered and annoyed in the middle of
 the summer season as the town is so   
 crowded it is difficult to do any     
 quick shopping.                       </content>
