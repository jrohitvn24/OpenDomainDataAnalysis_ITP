		<title>04THE RAILWAY LINE TO TAUNTON</title>
		<content>  The mainline railway tracks from     
 Bristol and London,Paddington to the  
 West Country,run through our area.The 
 two tracks meet at Cogload Junction.  
  At the moment three signalmen,working
 in shifts,control Cogload Signal Box. 
 However,next May this will change as  
 signalmen will no longer be needed.In 
 the interests of efficiency the whole 
 signalling system will be electrified.
 Instead of signals there will be a    
 system of coloured lights.            
  It's a very busy line.There are local
 and inter_city passenger services and 
 freight trains.On average,70 trains a 
 day use the track.The freight trains  
 usually travel in the evenings and at 
 night.Two of their main loads are clay
 from Cornwall and cider from Taunton. 
  This year,to celebrate the 150th     
 anniversary of the Great Western      
 Railway,a few steam trains have run.  </content>
