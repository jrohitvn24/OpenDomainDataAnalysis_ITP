		<title>03PENN WOODS IN HOLMER GREEN</title>
		<content>Penn Woods has good footpaths and the  
trees are marked with white arrows and 
numbers to help find the way.Apart from
trees and bushes the main plants are   
ferns,rhododendrons,foxgloves,moss and 
heathers.Leaves cover the ground where 
nothing is growing.There are many dells
filled with dead leaves,which are fun  
to play in.Birds seen include greater  
spotted and lesser spotted woodpecker, 
chiff-chaff,kestrel and chaffinch.There
are squirrels and muntjac deer,but few 
people see the deer.A monument is      
marked on the map,but this has been    
damaged.There was also a fountain for  
the use of wildlife.The monument and   
the fountain were put in Penn Woods by 
the Ernest Cook Trust which used to own
the woodland.It is now owned by an     
agent in Gloucestershire.
