		<title>13FARMING</title>
		<content> There is hardly a square kilometre    
 within this D_BLCK which is not farmed
 in some way. It is the{primary        
{industry}of the area.                 
 All the farms are{arable farms,}few   
 carry{stock}in any quantity. Those    
 that do have their land bordering on  
 to the river where there is lush      
 grass. The stock consists of dairy    
 cattle, beef cattle and pigs.         
 The{crops}grown are cereals, mainly   
 wheat and barley, sugar beet, rape,   
 potatoes, peas, green beans, broad    
 beans and onions.                     
 Most farms, even small concerns, are  
{highly mechanised}and are worked with 
 only a few men.                       
 Many of the farms have buildings which
 date back to the 17th century, the    
 time of the agricultural revolution.  
 These are built of brick and flint,   
 the local stone.                      </content>
