		<title>10OIL DELIVERY FROM TIMSBURY</title>
		<content>       We visited an oil delivery      
 business that is very close to        
 our school.We asked thirteen          
 questions.Each of their four lorries  
 have six wheels.Ten men and two ladies
 work there altogether.                
       The average amount of oil       
 delivered in a day is about           
 twenty-five thousand litres.Their oil 
 is delivered to them four times each  
 day.Tankers containing twenty five    
 thousand litres of oil come from      
 Avonmouth Docks to deliver it to      
 them.None of the drivers listened to  
 'C.B.'Radio.                          
       This family business began as a 
 coal delivery  business until all the 
 local mines closed down.
