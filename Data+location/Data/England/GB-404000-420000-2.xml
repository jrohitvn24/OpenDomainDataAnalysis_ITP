		<title>02TOWNS AND VILLAGES</title>
		<content> Towns and villages still show the     
 positions of ancient settlements.     
 Originally they were found along the  
 valley bottoms near to the flowing    
 river, or perched along the ridges of 
 the hills. The present situation      
 follows a similar pattern.{Ripponden} 
 and{Triangle}are found along the side 
 of the River Ryburn. Norland Moor has 
 the small village of{Norland}on the   
 northern side, with{Barkisland}to the 
 south, and Upper{Greetland}to the     
 east.                                 
                                       
 The popularity of the area has grown  
 since the{M62 motorway}was built. The 
 road journey to Leeds or Bradford, or 
 to Manchester, takes only about half  
 an hour. New{housing}is causing the   
 villages to spread towards one        
 another.
