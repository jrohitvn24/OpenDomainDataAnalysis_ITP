		<title>12CHESTERTON-FOSSEWAY</title>
		<content>  The Fosseway was built early in the  
 Roman Conquest,A.D.42-48.It was a     
 lateral line of communication with    
 forts spread out at regular intervals 
 along it.                             
 Chesterton Camp was a small town built
 along this road.                      
 The Fosseway runs from Lincoln via    
 Cirencester and Bath finishing at     
 Exeter and Seaton.                    
 It was built wide enough for soldiers 
 to march along it six abreast.        
 The road was built by digging a       
 trench,and at the bottom was put a    
 layer of large stones and flints.     
 Then came layers of rammed chalk and  
 gravel,and finally a layer of stone   
 slabs were put on top to give it a    
 hard surface.
