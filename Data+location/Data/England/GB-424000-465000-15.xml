		<title>15FARMING  DAIRY AND BEEF</title>
		<content> There are 14 farms in this "D" block. 
 Dairy farming is the major category   
 but because of EEC regulations and    
 restrictions on producing too much    
 milk,many farmers are turning to beef 
 cattle.Milk is collected daily by     
 tanker and taken to Kirkby Malzeard   
 dairy for cheese making or sent to    
 Rowntrees in York for milk chocolate. 
 The Regional Milk Marketing Board is  
 in Harrogate.It organises transport,  
 makes scientific tests on quality and 
 helps farmers to sell their milk.The  
 most popular breed of dairy cattle is 
 the British Friesian.Favourite beef   
 cattle are Limousin,Charolais,Angus   
 and Hereford.Cattle markets used are  
 at Pannal,Otley,Ripon,Northallerton,  
 Pateley Bridge and Wharfedale.Feed is 
 bought from Masham,York,Pickering,    
 Driffield,Ripley and Tanfield.
