		<content> The area  has  a loamy soil over clay,
 ideally    suited    to      intensive
 cultivation  of  grass  which supports
 cattle  for  milk,  beef   and  sheep.
 Compound  fertilisers  used  with  top
 dressings of nitrogen  to boost summer
 growth   as  well  as  organic  manure
 produced  on the farm. Grass conserved
 for winter use in the form of hay (one
 crop )  &amp; silage (two or three crops),
 increasingly  in  big  bales.   Fields
 relatively small (3 - 25 acres) fenced
 with  hawthorn  hedges.  Dairy  cattle
 mostly Friesian,  grazed outside April
 to October and housed in cubicles  for
 the winter.  Calving  in the autumn is
 most popular and herd replacements are
 reared on the farm.   Beef cattle come
 from  the  dairy  herd  crossed   with
 Hereford or Charollais.  Sheep ( Mules
 and  Mashams )  are  reared for meat &amp;
 wool.                                 </content>
