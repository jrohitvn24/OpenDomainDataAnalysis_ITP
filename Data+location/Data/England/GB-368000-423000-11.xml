		<title>11Roman Road Estate,Blackburn.</title>
		<content>    Roman Road Housing Estate was built
 in 3 phases between 1974 and 1977.    
   Phases 1 and 2 were built by        
 Blackburn Council and phase 3 by the  
{Housing Association.}The estate was   
 built on imaginative lines with houses
 grouped around open spaces with play  
 facilities.The houses were built to a 
 high specification with full central  
 heating and all modern conveniences.  
   However when people moved in        
 problems soon began to appear.Shopping
 facilities were few and public        
 transport was inadequate.Many people  
 felt isolated;there were no           
 facilities for older children to 'let 
 off steam'and{vandalism}began to spoil
 the attractive appearance.            
   Many of the residents are{one parent
{families}who have moved in from other 
 parts of the country and find it hard 
 to cope without help from relatives.  </content>
