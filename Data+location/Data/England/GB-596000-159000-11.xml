      My name is Susan Leadbeater,I am 
 8 years of age. I have three brothers 
 older than me. On Sunday,21st. July   
 1985 I got up and read a comic,called 
 the Beano. Then I went downstairs to  
 watch the television. I watched       
 "Fang-Face". It was about four        
 teenagers one who changes into a      
 WEREWOLF when he sees the moon and    
 changes back when he sees the sun.    
 After "Fang-Face" I had my            
 breakfast,after which I got dressed   
 into my pink dress. I then went out to
 see my friend Amy Poole who lives at  
 Upper St. Annes. We both live in      
 Faversham.
