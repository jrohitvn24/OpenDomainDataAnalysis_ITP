		<title>11Honiton:translation of talk</title>
		<content>  When we came here and I was just a   
 girl, Honiton wasn't the same as it is
 now, it was really only the High      
 Street, New Street and nothing else.  
  Now in the summer, the place is full 
 of visitors, they are people who      
 picnic beside he motorways to admire  
 the view, and all they see is just    
 more cars.... silly great idiots!!    
  If you are left handed down here, we 
 say you are{coochy.}We ask 'Where are 
 you going?'or 'How are you?',to which 
 one answers 'I am alright, how are    
 you?', but the place is full of       
 foreigners and you can't understand   
 what they are saying, nor they you.   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
