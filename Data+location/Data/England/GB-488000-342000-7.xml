		<content> The inhabitants of the two villages   
 perform a variety of jobs although    
 there is not much employment in the   
 immediate area.  Locally the work is  
 mostly farming.                       
 Many people travel down the A1 to     
 Grantham for employment, there is a   
 Parish bus every morning and evening  
 to cater for their needs.             
 Many local women work in the          
 surrounding areas, a few in education,
 some in offices. Many women work on   
 the farms helping at harvest time or  
 helping with seasonal poultry.
