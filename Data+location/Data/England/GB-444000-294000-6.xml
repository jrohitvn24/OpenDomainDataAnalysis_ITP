		<content>  In our survey we questioned people   
 concerning the popularity of local    
 sources of entertainment.             
{Public Houses}were a popular location;
 58% of the sample visited their local 
 pub regularly.                        
{Discos and dances}were visited less   
 frequently, although if the dance was 
 held in a local social club or pub,   
 more people felt inclined to attend.  
 Such social clubs in this area include
 the Liberal club and the Working Mens 
 Club.                                 
{ Cinemas and theatre}proved to be     
 less popular; only 14% of the random  
 sample visited the theatre regularly, 
 and only 5% were regulars at the      
 cinema - over 33% of the sample       
 prefered never to visit either place. 
 Listening to{music}at home was a      
 popular evenings entertainment for    
 those who prefered not to go out.     </content>
