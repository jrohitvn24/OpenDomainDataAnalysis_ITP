		<content> The growth of Ingatestone in modern   
 times reflects its location on the    
 main railway line from London         
 (Liverpool Street Station) to         
 Chelmsford, Ipswich and beyond. The   
 line, originally constructed in the   
 1840's, is now electrified and        
 although not all trains stop at       
 Ingatestone Station there is a        
 reasonably frequent service to        
 Liverpool Street particularly during  
 rush hours. The service is fairly fast
 and as such has made the area         
 attractive to commuters. Ingatestone  
 is about 30 miles from London         
 and lies within the 'green belt' - an 
 area around London in which           
 residential and commercial development
 is severely restricted. A large       
 proportion of the employed population 
 work outside the area.
