		<content> Miss Dean first came to North Stifford
 because she became employed at the    
 Thurrock Tecnical College.She came    
 looking for a house ,in 1962.She      
 bought 'Viola Cottage'for             
 Â£4,500.Before it was a cottage it was 
 a pub named 'The Bell'because of the  
 church bells opposite.Then it was     
 called 'The Oak'because of the Oak    
 tree in  her garden.Miss Dean wrote   
 the book called the 'Stifford Saga'   
 which told the history of North       
 Stifford and the surrounding area.It  
 started off with a competition for the
 Women's Institute,to see who could get
 their village on the map.She won first
 prize for the Mar Dyke Women's        
 Institute.There was so much           
 information to put in it that they    
 made a book.They sold 1,400 copies.The
 Duke of Edinborough accepted a copy.  
   Matthew Tucker and Vivienne Clark.  </content>
