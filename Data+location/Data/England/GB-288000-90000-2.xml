		<title>02THE HISTORY OF BUDDLE LANE.</title>
		<content>    The even numbers on Buddle Lane    
 were built in the 1930's before the   
 2nd W.W.  They were built on open     
 fields and an orchard.  Some of the   
 old trees are still growing in the    
 gardens.  The odd numbers were built  
 in 1919 to 1920 just after the 1stW.W.
  It used to be called Monditter       
 Terrace.  They were some of the first 
 experimental government houses to be  
 built.  There used to be an open water
 drain taking water from the fields    
 behind John Stocker school to a       
 viaduct in the pleasure grounds behind
 the Methodist Church. No.16 used to be
 a dairy with cobblestones outside.    
 Mrs. Hook at 35 Buddle Lane told me   
 all this.  She has lived there for 61 
 years and remembers horses and carts  
 along the road.
