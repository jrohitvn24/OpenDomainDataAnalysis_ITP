		<title>05TOURISM IN BENTHAM</title>
		<content> Bentham lies on the edge of the       
 Yorkshire Dales and offers holiday    
 accommodation in rural surroundings. A
 recent addition to this type of       
 accommodation is Nookdales which used 
 to be a farm. The sheep dip can still 
 be seen.  The barn and some of the out
 buildings have been converted into six
 cottages. Outside there is a play area
 for the children, a table tennis room 
 and picnic areas.  The land is 6.2    
 acres, mostly of woodland, providing  
 an idyllic setting, abundant with     
 wildlife. The project has been        
 supported by the English Tourist      
 Board. There are also three caravan   
 sites in the area and many farm houses
 and country houses offering bed and   
 breakfast. In Bentham there is a      
 Tourist Information Centre.
