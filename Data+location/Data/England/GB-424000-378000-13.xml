		<content> "Sir William Hill", on the Grindleford
 to Hathersage road is an example and  
 Nether Padley may have been derived   
 from the name 'PADDA' and become known
 as Padda's clearing. Nether Padley is 
 now a civil parish having it's own    
 parish council. We are fortunate in   
 having a member of that council, who  
 lives on the main Grindleford to      
 Calver road, who has given us much    
 local information. He is Alan Jacques,
 who is keeper of the village archives,
 as was his father before him. One very
 interesting fact which has come to    
 light recently is the plan to         
 amalgamate the parishes of Stoke, Eyam
 Woodlands, Nether Padley and Upper    
 Padley to form a single civil parish  
 of Grindleford. It is felt that this  
 would unite the formerly fragmented   
 parish situation and ensure a feeling 
 of belonging to one community.        </content>
