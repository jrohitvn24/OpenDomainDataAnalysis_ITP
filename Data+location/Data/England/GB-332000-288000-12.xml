		<content>  My Dad became a brewer after working 
 at the Three Tuns pub on a building   
 job.                                  
                                       
  Then a job became vacant as assistant
 brewer and my Dad started working     
 there.He liked it so much he stayed   
 on.He makes on average of about 15    
 barrels of beer per week through out  
 the year.(540 gallons).He has been    
 working there seven years. He makes   
 (1) Bitter (2) Mild (3) Steamer, and  
 a special Xmas brew called Scrooge. He
 also brews special beers usually for  
 Royal ocassions.He has worked there   
 for seven years and enjoys his work   
 very much.
