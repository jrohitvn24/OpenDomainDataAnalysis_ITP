		<content>          By Daisy Bellman             
                                       
{Elizabeth Watling}&amp;{Michael Tobin}went
 to see{Mrs Daisy Huggins}who had      
 started at{St Lawrencc School}in{1907.
 They asked her about her childhood    
 when she was Daisy Bellman.           
                                       
 "There were a lot a more shops in     
 Roehedge.  people did not have to go  
 into Colchester for such things as    
 fish, meat or to buy or repair shoes. 
      The roads were dusty in summer   
 and muddy in winter as there was no   
 tar, when tar did come it brought more
 traffic to Rowhedge.                  
      Dr Sanderson said to me "I would 
 have liked to live here along time ago
 it must have been a small paradise"   
 "yes"it was"                          
                                       
                                       </content>
