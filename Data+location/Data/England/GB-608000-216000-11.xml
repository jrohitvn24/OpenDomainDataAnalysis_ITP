		<content> Two other employers in the town that  
 are specialist in their own way       
 are;High Heat Mouldings ( making      
 injection moulded components for a    
 variety of customers ) and Wood and   
 Mott ( specialising in reproduction   
 furniture of very high class, much of 
 which is made to order for foreign    
 buyers. )                             
                                       
 As with most communities there are a  
 number of small builder / decorators, 
 electricians, motor vehicle repairers 
 and other services the majority of    
 whom do not employ more than three or 
 four staff,usually they are of one man
 operation.                            
 Most of these enterprises are adjacent
 to the Waterfront or on an Industrial 
 Estate located off Sampsons Road.
