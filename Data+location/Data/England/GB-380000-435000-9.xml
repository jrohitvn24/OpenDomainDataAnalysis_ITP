		<content>  100 years ago there was few people   
 in Fence people were related together.
 The Padiham Bypass was  a dust        
 track.The village was isolated. When  
 my Grandad was a  boy they didn't have
 a tractor on the farm,but a horse and 
 cart to plough. Milking was done by   
 hand because they didn't have machines
 .25 yrs ago there were changes to the 
 village.The chip shop and the cafe    
 closed.Every week a mobile butchers   
 and greengrocers used to stop for 2   
 hours just outside the school.        
 The bus services were a lot better    
 than today.Now they come every 2 hours
 instead of one.The last one is at     
 about 6.30pm.P ople who cannot drive  
 suffer.                               
 When the Bypass was built my Grandad  
 lost lots of money because it went    
 right through his fields of crops,so  
 he had to get another job.            </content>
