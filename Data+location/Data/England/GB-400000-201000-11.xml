		<title>11COTSWOLD SPORTS CENTRE</title>
		<content> We have a sports centre in            
 Cirencester. People travel up to 20   
 miles to get there. We talked to Mrs  
 Bishop Bailey, the manageress who said
 that there were squash courts, a main 
 hall, a weight training room, activity
 room and two swimming pools. About    
 400,000 people use the sports centre  
 every year. When people go swimming   
 there is always a life guard on duty. 
 There are between 10 and 20 accidents 
 every year. 29 people work there. They
 feel the centre should have a bigger  
 creche. The creche cares for young    
 children so mothers can have fun. The 
 public said the pool should be bigger.
 Most people said they use the sports  
 centre once a week.
