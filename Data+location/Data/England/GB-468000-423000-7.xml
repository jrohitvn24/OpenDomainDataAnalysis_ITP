		<content> I think that the most interesting     
 thing was the history of the old      
 building. We learnt that when it was a
 house it got burnt down and only what 
 is now the office was not burnt down. 
 The most boring thing was when we were
 waiting to go in all the different    
 wards. The nurse who was taking us    
 round had to ask if we could go in.   
 All the nurses and domestics were all 
 very kind. Some of the people were    
 squeezed up because part of the       
 building was getting decorated.
