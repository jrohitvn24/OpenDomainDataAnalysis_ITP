		<title>03HACKLINGE AREA POPULATION</title>
		<content> The population numbers 520 adults and 
 children approx. The densest area is  
 in the Mining Village known as the    
 Circle.                               
                                       
 Most inhabitants chose to reside in   
 the area and are happy living here. It
 is generally hoped there will be      
 little or no change. In fact many felt
 that any change might be for the      
 worse. An exception to this view was  
 in Burgess Green where they suffer    
 from noise and pollution from the pit 
 lorries. The younger people hoped for 
 more employmment opportunities and    
 many wished for more leisure and      
 sports facilities to be nearer home.  
 The scenery and peace are appreciated 
 and in some cases are the reasons for 
 choosing to live here.
