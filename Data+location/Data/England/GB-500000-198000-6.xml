		<title>06CHENIES VILLAGE.</title>
		<content> When the Duke of Bedford's estate was 
 split up and sold for auction in 1954,
 much of it was purchased by a property
 developer who hoped to be allowed to  
 build more housing on the land.       
 However this was not allowed,and many 
 of the properties were then resold to 
 those who already rented them.In this 
 way some of the farms continued as    
 they had been previously run.         
 However there has been a gradual      
 'Gentrification' of the farms,with    
 many of the large farmhouses being    
 converted to private residences,and   
 old farm workers cottages changed to  
 farm housing.Also outhouses have been 
 converted to housing and land rented  
 to neighbouring farms.In this way the 
 character of the village and its farms
 has changed dramatically.
