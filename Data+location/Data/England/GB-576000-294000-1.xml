		<title>01Wissey Valley near Cranwich</title>
		<content> The Lowlying area is mainly arable and
 meadowland.  On the rising ground     
 therre are woodlands and plantations. 
 The area to the Notth is Privately    
 owned parkland with ornamental lakes  
 around a now demolished Didlington    
 Hall.  A small estate village, with a 
 church, of about 48 persons still     
 exists.  Little London, to the west   
 near the village of Northwold, has a  
 score or so cottages, whilst Cranwich,
 on the Thetford and Kings Lynn road,  
 is a mere scattered dozen or so       
 dwellings, although it retains its    
 thatched church, parts dating from    
 13th Century.  There are five mixed   
 farms in the area and an intensive    
 pig-rearing unit.  The southern edge  
 is plantation and abuts the extensive 
 forestry commission area of Cranwich  
 heath (Map ref 05760291) which is     
 almost entirely covered by conifers.  </content>
