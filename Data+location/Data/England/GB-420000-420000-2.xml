		<title>02HOUSING IN DEWSBURY MOOR</title>
		<content> The area under study was two small    
 estates in Dewsbury Moor. The houses  
 in the{"Becket"}and{"Pilgrim"}estates 
 are council houses, built in 1928/29. 
 Originally,{Pilgrim Farm}occupied the 
 land but it was pulled down to make   
 way for the new estate which retained 
 the name pilgrim.                     
 Only 10 of the houses on the Becket   
 estate and 2 in the Pilgrim estate are
 privately owned despite{government    
{policy}to encourage purchase of       
 council houses since 1979.            
 There are a variety of different types
 of housing on the estates including   
 terraces, bungalows and semi-detached 
 - all of which are brick built.       
 The people living on the two estates  
 are a mixture of{English}and{Asian    
 families. Strangely enough some modern
 Georgian-designed detached houses have
 been built next to the estates.       </content>
