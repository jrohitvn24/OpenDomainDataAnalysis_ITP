		<title>06Black Dyke Mills Brass Band</title>
		<content> A brass and read band, originally     
 formed in 1815, became associated with
 Black Dyke Mills when John Foster, a  
 french horn player who owned the mills
 gave financial support. Since 1855 the
 band has been sponsored by Black Dyke 
 Mills. At first all the band members  
 worked at John Foster's mill but now  
 none of them work there.              
 In 1860 the band won the first brass  
 band contest at Crystal Palace in     
 London. (Since the 2nd World War they 
 have won 13 National and 5 European   
 championships.) They have travelled to
 9 countries abroad. They have played  
 for Royalty and made 35 long playing  
 records. They have got 26 members and 
 two conductors. Their uniforms are    
 made of Foster's cloth. In 1976 the   
 band were given the (FREEDOM of the   
 CITY of BRADFORD.
