		<content>  Most people work for five days a week
  from nine 'till five and have        
 weekends free. Evenings are often     
 spent watching T.V. but some people   
 play sports, go swimming, fishing or  
 to badminton. Gardening takes up quite
 a bit of time as does D.I.Y. home     
 improvement, car washing, cooking and 
 shopping. Children spend quite a lot  
 of time with their home computers. In 
 our school 60% of children have       
 computers of their own.               
  Homes usually have central heating,  
 mainly oil and gas. Double glazing and
 energy saving plans are popular. Most 
 houses are modern and have three      
 bedrooms, a garage and a small garden.
 Small cars are popular and generally  
 are not much more than five years old.
