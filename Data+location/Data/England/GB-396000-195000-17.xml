		<content>  {Kemble Aerodrome}was opened in 1939.
 It was owned by the{RAF.}In 1984, the 
{Americans}came and took over most of  
 it. There is a British C.O. and an    
 American C.O. The British and the     
 Americans work very closely together. 
 The main work of the base is          
 maintenance and storage. Many people  
 are employed there.                   
  Among the planes which we can see

 F 5, Heron 135, E 15 Eagle, Hercules  
 and Devon 75. The runway is 6550 feet 
 long. There are 14 hangars. Some are  
 used by the British but most by the   
 Americans.
