		<title>05FARMING IN DELABOLE</title>
		<content>  By Rachel Davey.                     
       My dad works on a farm.When he  
 gets up every morning he has a cup of 
 tea.Then he goes out.My mum is out    
 already getting the cows from the     
 field.In the winter they are in the   
 shed already.Then they start milking. 
 After milking my dad takes them to    
 field while my mum comes in and my    
 brother and I have our breakfast.When 
 we are gone they have their breakfast,
 that is about 10.15.After that my dad 
 washes the shed,while my mum gets on  
 with the house work.Later my dad and  
 my grandad go to Treligga. We have a  
 few fields and sheds there.When he    
 comes back we all have dinner.At about
 6 o'clock my dad goes and fetches the 
 cows,then my mum and dad do the       
 milking.It takes about one and a half 
 hours.When he finishes he has his     
 supper.Then they both go to bed.      </content>
