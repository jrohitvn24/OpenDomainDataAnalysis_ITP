		<content> The Church of England Primary School  
 is a small two class village school   
 with 28 pupils.Children commence in   
 the term they attain the age of five. 
 When they are eight they moove up to  
 the second class and at eleven they   
 transfer to Comprehensive school.With 
 a teaching staff of 2.2 it's difficult
 to cover all areas of the curriculum  
 adequately so once a week the Infant  
 teacher,Mrs.White,exchanges with a    
 music teacher from another school and 
 mothers come to take cookery.As the   
 school has no sportsfield Mr.Smith,the
 headmaster, and the Junior children   
 travel to another school to share its 
 facilities and travel to Neston for   
 swimming lessons once a week.Pupils   
 transfer to Whitby Comprehensive and  
 as there is no public transport a     
 special bus takes and collects them   
 each day.                             </content>
