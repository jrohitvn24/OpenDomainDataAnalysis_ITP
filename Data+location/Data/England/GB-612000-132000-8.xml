   On the gun deck, there is a twenty  
 four pound gun. Before you reach the  
 gun there is a door with a hole to    
 poke ammunition through to the people 
 firing the gun. The bricks came from  
 London and were provided by Messrs    
 Helam and Robertson of Old Bond       
 Street. The work was inspected by two 
 engineer officers,{Captain Cunningham 
 and{Captain Goldfinch.                
                                       
  Two of the towers were built to      
 protect one of the sluices which      
 controlled the water level of the     
 marsh.                                
                                       
   The towers were constructed with    
 circular walls so if cannon balls hit 
 the walls, the corners would not fall 
 off.                                  
                                       </content>
