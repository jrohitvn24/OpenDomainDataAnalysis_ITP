		<title>13Davenham School</title>
		<content> Education in the village is provided  
 at Davenham Primary School, It was    
 built in 1856. It hasn't got a very   
 big playground or many facilities.    
 There is difficulty in getting from   
 one classroom to another that is why  
 we are having a new school. It is     
 going to be started in 1987 to 1988.  
 The number of pupils in the old school
 has fallen from 200 to 180. The new   
 school will be a primary school with a
 1 form entry, it will have 7 classes. 
 It will be a modern building with more
 space and more school facilities.     
 Better facilities will include art and
 craft areas. It will have space for   
 science, music etc. It will have a    
 field attached with shrubs and a      
 garden. The new school will have a    
 kitchen. The old school will probably 
 become a day centre.
