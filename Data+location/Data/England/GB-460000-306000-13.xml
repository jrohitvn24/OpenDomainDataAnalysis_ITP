		<title>13THE HUMBERSTONE</title>
		<content> According to local legend,"Humbeort's"
 stone(also Holystone or Hellstone) has
 magical qualities including the power 
 to bring bad luck to  those foolish   
 enough to touch it.Although difficult 
 to find, the{Humberstone}can still be 
 seen in a field off Thurmaston Lane.  
 In 1878 excavation revealed the       
 full size of the stone as a roughly   
 oval block some three  metres long,two
 metres deep and two metres across.It  
 is thought to be a glacial erratic    
 deposited as the ice retreated many   
 thousands of years ago.Although the   
 exposed top of the stone has been     
 weathered smooth the buried section   
 retains the angular edges received    
 when it was plucked from the outcrop  
 of Mountsorrel granite.The stone is   
 said to align with St.John's stone    
 (near Leicester Abbey) on Midsummer's 
 day. O.S.Reference:SK 624071(1:50 000)</content>
