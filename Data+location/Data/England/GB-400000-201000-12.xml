		<content> Most houses are now built in fields   
 that have been dug up. They are made  
 with concrete,bricks,cement and stone.
 The Council build council houses to   
 rent to other people. It costs about  
 Â£25,000 to build a council house      
 today. The foundations are made of    
 concrete and gravel.It would cost     
 about Â£23,000 to buy a small house.   
 Most 2 - 3 bedroomed houses cost      
 around Â£33,000 to Â£43,000.Tiles are   
 usually used for roofs rather than    
 slates. About 16,000 people live in   
 Cirencester. Most of the houses are   
 owner occupied but there are 1,500    
 rented houses and 195 warden          
 controlled flats for elderly people.  
 Most houses have central heating, some
 have double glazing on the windows to 
 help insulate. People have built over 
 massive fireplaces in many older      
 houses.                               </content>
