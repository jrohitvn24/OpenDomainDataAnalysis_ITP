		<title>01GAZETTEER OF AREA</title>
		<content>  The area is situated about 20kms     
 North of{Bristol}on the A38 near to   
 the{Interchange}of the{M4}and{M5.     
  Essentially, it is a{rural area}and  
 although a map shows the Motorways    
 scoring the land they have a minimal  
 influence on the people &amp; communities.
{ Large tracts}of the district are     
 given over to intensively managed     
{grassland}in a highly fertile part of 
 the Severn Valley.                    
{ Almondsbury}is a small village       
 which is split into an older, and more
 expensive part by the A38. Despite its
 proximity to Bristol most inhabitants 
 prefer to go northwards to local      
 Thornbury for recreation and other    
 facilities.                           
  There is a large{hospital}for the    
 mentally handicapped, a local{forge,  
{few}shops or services, a primary      
 school and{numerous farms.            </content>
