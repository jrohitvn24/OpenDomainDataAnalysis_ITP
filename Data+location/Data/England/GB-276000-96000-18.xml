		<title>18SCHOOL DAY,Yeoford.</title>
		<content> In the morning after breakfast I put  
 my packed lunch and homework in my bag
 ready for school. At 8.20 a.m. I walk 
 down the drive ready for the school   
 bus. The school bus usually comes     
 between 8.25 a.m. and 8.30 a.m. When  
 we arrive at school I go to the       
 cloakroom and hang up my bag, I take  
 out my homework and put it in my      
 locker. Next I take out the football  
 to the playground and play with it.   
 The bell rings at 9 a.m. When the     
 bell rings I take the football in, put
 it away and sit in my seat ready for  
 register. After register we usually do
 English until break at 10.30 a.m. At  
 break we play games until 10.45 a.m.  
 We come in and do Maths until 11.55   
 a.m. when we lay up for dinner. We    
 have dinner at 12.00. At 12.30 we go  
 out to play until 1.15, when we come  
 in to do English until 3.30.We go home</content>
