		<content>    The population of Bingham is       
 approximately{7,000}. The people live 
 in the main in private houses but     
 there is also a fairly large{council  
{estate,}which was the first estate    
 built in Bingham. There still exists a
 number of old houses and buildings    
 around the centre of Bingham, which   
 made up the old village, but various  
 private estates have been built since 
 the council estate.                   
    The{Enness estate}was built in two 
 phases: firstly the{Church Farm estate
 and then the{Holme Farm estate.}The   
{Gough Cooper estate}was built next and
 this was followed by the{Vic Hallam   
{estate,}which has been nicknamed the  
 'Tree' estate because all the roads   
 were named after trees(e.g. Ash Grove,
 Cedar Close, Oak Avenue, etc). The    
{Greenwood estate}was built 7 years ago
 and the{Winhill estate}is under way.  </content>
