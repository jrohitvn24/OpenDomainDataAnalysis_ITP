		<title>05MY OPINION ON THE COUNTRY</title>
		<content> I think that England is a pretty good 
 Country and i think there shouldn't be
 any war or quarrels over silly        
 matters.I think there should be more  
 jobs but the trouble is,that more and 
 more computers are taking over        
 different sorts of jobs.I think we    
 should have heavier fines for people  
 who drop litter and more official tips
 where can go to dump their rubbish.We 
 should have a bigger police force so  
 that law and order can be held.Every  
 shop should have the latest in burglar
 alarms.I dont think we should have    
 nuclear weapons if one is fired it    
 could kill millions of people.I wish  
 also that we could find a new source  
 of fuel for cars so we cut down       
 pollution.We shouldn't use aerosol    
 cans because the perpellant destroys  
 the ozone layer and the atmosphere    
 wouldn't protect us. By Marc Davies   </content>
