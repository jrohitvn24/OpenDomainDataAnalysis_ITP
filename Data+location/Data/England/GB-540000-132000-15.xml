		<title>15MICHAEL HALL SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Michael Hall School came to           
 the  Forest Row area in{1925}and      
 follows the teachings of {Rudolf      
{Steiner.}There are four classes in the
 Kindergarten catering for the         
 pre-school child.In the main school   
 there are 13 levels through which the 
 children pass on their way to the     
 public examinations of O and A level. 
 The school differs greatly from the   
 state education in that much emphasis 
 is placed on the spiritual development
 of the child as well as the social and
 academic development. Much{Art,Music, 
{Drama}and{Eurythmy}are taught.Children
 are kept in their year groups and the 
 bright are encouraged to help the less
 able and in so doing a greater social 
 awareness is nurtured.The aims of the 
 Anthroposophical movement are clearly 
 advanced in this school.
