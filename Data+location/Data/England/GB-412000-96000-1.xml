		<title>01OUR AREA</title>
		<content> Our area is a very rural one which is 
 bordered by the towns of{Bournemouth  
 and{Christchurch}to the South and by  
 the New Forest to the East. Most of   
 the land in our area belongs to one of
 two people, either{Lord Malmesbury}or 
{Lord Manners}both of whom run thier   
 estates from outside the area itself. 
{Lord Malmesbury's }country house still
 exists and can be found on the very   
 Southern edge of our area, it is      
 currently being used as a private boys
 boarding school and retains the       
 original name of{Hurn Court.          
 Two small villages are contained      
 within the area,{Hurn}and{Sopley}but  
 the vast majority of land is used for 
{forestry}or{farming.}The{River Avon}  
 provides some good{fishing}and the    
{Ramsdown Plantation}is a good walking 
 area.
