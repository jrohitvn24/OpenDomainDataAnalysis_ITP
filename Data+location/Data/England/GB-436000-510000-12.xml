		<title>12CHURCH SUNDIALS</title>
		<content> The font is ancient and consists of a 
 circular tub of sandstone on a stepped
 base and a high octagonal plinth and  
 it is generally thought it could be   
 12th century.  The most notable       
 feature of this church was a sundial  
 which is now housed in St.Laurence's  
 church. This sundial,or possibly,Mass 
 Dial's fame arises from the fact that 
 it is one of only three in England in 
 which the lower part is divided into  
 tenths. Saxons divided their day into 
 eight. One of these three sundials is 
 at Old Byland which used to have an   
 inscription on it which was           
 undoubtedly Saxon. There are other    
 decimal sundials in                   
 Scandinavia,schools believe it dates  
 from about 850 AD.
