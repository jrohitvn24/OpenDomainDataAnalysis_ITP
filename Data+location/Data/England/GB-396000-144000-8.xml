		<title>08HOME LIFE IN CHITTERNE</title>
		<content> Chitterne is fairly typical of rural  
 Wiltshire. Most wage earners have to  
 travel some distance to work and are  
 away from home all day. Many families 
 own more than one car.  The main meal 
 is usually taken in the evening and   
 often consists of a meat course such  
 as chops or mince with potatoes and   
 other root and green vegetables.      
 Convenience foods such as sausages,   
 beefburgers and frozen foods are      
 popular especially when both adults in
 the family are working.  Sunday roast 
 dinner is still a highlight of the    
 weekend and is often an occasion for  
 all the family to get together.       
 Leisure hours are spent gardening,    
 walking, reading and watching         
 television. Some people enjoy         
 painting, needlework, knitting and    
 other craft work.
