 The Wheatsheaf is a hotel on the      
Coventry Road. It is a busy hotel and  
has many customers. It has a large car 
park which leads to a bus stop. It has 
many customers because of the many     
shops that surround it.  The hotel has 
stood since the early Eighteenth       
century when it started as a coaching  
inn.                                   
  The hotel itself is situated at the  
junction of Coventry Road and of Lode  
Lane. These extremely busy roads help  
to make this shopping centre a good    
one. There are 132 shops in all and

of 75 services and 25 food and drink   
shops.                                 
 There are also many other varieties   
which make this an excellent shopping  
centre.
