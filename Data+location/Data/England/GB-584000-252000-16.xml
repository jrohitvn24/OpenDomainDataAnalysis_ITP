		<content>Extracts from the monthly Parish       
Newsletter July 1985. Lawshall Mother's
Union-members attended a fete held in  
the Archdeacon's garden. It was a won- 
derful opportunity to meet and make    
friends with other members of the      
Sudbury Deanery.                       
Tramp's Supper on Saturday 10th August 
at 8pm in the Village Hall.Tickets 250p
which includes a Chicken &amp; Chips Supper
Prize for the Best Tramp!              
The Topiary Art displayed in Harry's   
garden which has given so much pleasure
to children and visitors to Lawshall   
Village, has been vandalised. What a   
challange it would be to carry out     
vandalism during the hours of daylight 
with the chance of getting caught!     
But being COWARDS, vandals only do     
their devastating deeds under the cover
of darkness!
