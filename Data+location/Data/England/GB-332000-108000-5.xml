		<title>05BUSES &amp; LORRIES IN CHARD</title>
		<content> Over a few days in June we went into  
 Chard to ask people their opinions    
 on the lorries in town.We interviewed 
 people at various busy places  such as
 the town centre,the museum and Manor  
 Court School.                         
 The questions we asked were:-         
 1)Do you like lorries? 60% of the     
   people said no.                     
 2)Do you think they pollute the       
 atmosphere?90% of the people think    
 they do.                              
                                       
{BUSES                                 
 Two double decker and three single    
 decker buses go through Chard every   
 half hour to Taunton,Weymouth and     
 Bridport.They take a long time because
 they go through all the villages.     
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
