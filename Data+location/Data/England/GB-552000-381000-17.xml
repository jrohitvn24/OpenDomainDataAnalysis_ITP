		<title>17A Dentist in Sutton on Sea.</title>
		<content> The dentist in Sutton on Sea is{Mr    
{M.Carlisle.}He has worked here for 10 
 years. He moved from Kings Lynn in    
 Norfolk before which he lived in      
 Liverpool where he trained to be a    
 dentist.He lives in Sandilands and has
 a practice in Park Rd East. He sees   
 about 40-50 people a day. He does not 
 think the dentist's job has changed   
 much although instruments are more    
 modern. Patients seem to dread the    
 syringe most but they are usually very
 good. He also has a surgery in{Alford.
 In the surgery in Sutton there is a   
 big chair which leans back and has    
 drawers where he puts his instruments.
 There is a bowl by the chair where the
 patients rinse their mouths. The flat 
 above is rented out to holidaymakers  
 but our headmaster{Mr Jones}lives     
 there at the moment.{Mrs Carlisle     
 sometimes works in the surgery.       </content>
