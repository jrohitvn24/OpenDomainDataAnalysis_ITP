		<content>    Many religions have their own      
 places of worship in Burgess Hill.    
    There are three{Anglican}churches. 
 The oldest building was St.John's     
 Chapel which was replaced by St.John's
 Church in the early nineteenth        
 century. It was built on the original 
 St.John's common that covered most of 
 the West of the town. It still uses   
 its bells. St.Andrew's church was then
 built in the East of the town, and in 
 1960 St.Edward's church was build on  
 part of St.John's churchyard. All of  
 the churches have a Sunday School. {  
{  }St.Wilfrid's{Roman Catholic}Church 
 was built around 1940. The original   
 church was extended in 1961. There is 
 a carved statue of St.Wilfrid the     
 patron saint of Sussex in the church. 
 It is said that the wood used for it  
 is a piece of ship's wood dating back 
 to the 13th century.                  </content>
