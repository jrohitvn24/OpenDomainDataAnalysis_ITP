		<title>04ECOLOGY OF THE RIVER DANE</title>
		<content> Meandering through pastureland, the   
 River Dane is subject to constant     
 erosion and deposition of pebbles,    
 gravel and silt.  The river bank holds
 the remains of crack willow, felled   
 because of their age, with little     
 evidence of re-planting.  Sand        
 martins, kingfishers, water voles and 
 water rats inhabit the river bank.  An
 abundance of shepherd's purse,        
 nettles, wild rhubarb and various     
 grasses shelter a varied insenct life.
 Following the basic course of the     
 river, a rough public footpath cuts   
 through scattered deciduous woodlands 
 of ash, oak, lime, sycamore and beech.
 Enlarged fields are bounded by a      
 network of hawthorn and elder hedges  
 filled with wild rose, bramble and    
 vetch.  Squirrels, weasels, rabbits,  
 foxes, shrews, field mice are all     
 inhabitants of the environment.       </content>
