		<title>09MINERAL LINES</title>
		<content> This square is crossed by an old      
 mineral line running from Moor Row to 
 Whitehaven.The surrounding area was   
 rich in iron ore and the numerous     
 small spoil heaps litter the land     
 around Bigrigg and Moor Row.The old   
 line can still be traced with         
 embankments and bridges still         
 visible.The main A595 crosses such a  
 bridge.                               
 Also contained within the square is   
 Ingwell School,a residential school   
 for children with learning            
 difficulties.Previously a mansion,the 
 school was opened in September 1953   
 and possesses a wide range of         
 facilities including a swimming       
 pool,football pitches and miniature   
 golf course.Adjoining cottages house  
 members of staff.
