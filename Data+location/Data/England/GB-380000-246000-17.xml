		<content>{The Bathroom}is usually quite a small 
 room, containing a fibre_glass or now 
 not so commonly,a cast iron bath,and a
 ceramic toilet and wash               
 basin.Attatched to the wall will      
 probably be a towel rail,and perhaps a
 small shelf or two,upon which to keep 
 toothbrushes, toothpaste,bottles of   
 shampoo and aftershave.Also hanging   
 from the wall will be a mirror.       
 Frequently to be found in the bathroom
 is a medicine cabinet,usually on the  
 wall,for medicines,antiseptic creams  
 and lotions,and First Aid             
 equipment.Because the bathroom has a  
 damp atmosphere, the walls are often  
 covered with emulsion paint,or vinyl  
 covered wall paper that can be wiped  
 dry easily. There are usually a couple
 of rows of ceramic tiles around the   
 bath and wash basin.
