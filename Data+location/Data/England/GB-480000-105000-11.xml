		<title>11PROPOSED TRUNK ROAD</title>
		<content>  One of the most{controversial issues}
 during the last decade has  been      
 proposals to{construct a trunk road}  
 through the countryside contained in  
 this survey area.                     
  The present{A27 coast road}is only a 
{single carriageway}and carries large  
 numbers of vehicles including heavy   
 lorries.It is not adequate to carry   
 the present volume of traffic.        
  The new road would be{between Havant}
{and Fishbourne}but cut through        
 farms,woods and homes.A public inquiry
 proved very heated with numerous      
 objectors and alternative routes.     
  In{1985}the Minister for Transport   
 approved a proposed route and         
 construction work has already begun.  
  Despite objections the{numerous }    
{accidents}on the existing road stress 
 the importance of the new road.
