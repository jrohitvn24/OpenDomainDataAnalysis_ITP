		<title>18THE ANTHONY CURTON VA SCHOOL</title>
		<content> In 1723 a farmer called ANTHONY CURTON
 endowed money for the provsion of a   
 school in Walpole.A schoolroom was    
 established above the south porch at  
 Walpole St. Peter church.On payment   
 any child from Walpole could attend   
 this school.In 1806 new premises were 
 built for the school opposite the     
 rectory.Following an extension in 1923
 this school survived until 1983 and at
 that time was the oldest entire       
 working school in Norfolk.            
   After the 1870 Education Act and the
 opening of a school at Walpole St.    
 Andrew,the Curtons Endowed School was 
 used mainly for boys aged 7-14.The    
 opening of our new school gave the    
 Walpoles not just classrooms but also 
 a hall,kitchen,library,offices and    
 playing field.
