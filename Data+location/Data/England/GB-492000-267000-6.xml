		<content> DITCHFORD LAKES.                      
                                       
 Ditchford Lakes were formed by old    
 gravel workings in the late           
 1930's.They are now mainly used by    
 private anglers who are after the     
 stocks of tench,carp,roach,bream,pike,
 rudd and eels.These lakes are owned by
 East Northants District Council but   
 are fished by Rushden,Higham and      
 Irchester Angling Associations and the
 Wellingborough Nene Angling Club.     
  The lakes cover about half a square  
 mile and also supply some of Rushden's
 water,which is purified at a treatment
 plant owned by the Anglian Water      
 Authority.The lakes are very          
 shallow,with an average depth of five 
 feet.The banks are mainly uncut grass 
 and bullrushes,ant there is a good    
 selection of wildlife,including       
 swans,herons and moorhens.  P.Williams</content>
