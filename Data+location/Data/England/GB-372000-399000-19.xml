		<title>19A Day In My Life 2</title>
		<content> We went by bus to Eccles Pool. We got 
 back at 10 past 3 and I brought my    
 notebook up to date 'till school ended
 at 3.30pm. Then I met by mum and went 
 home and made a sandwich.             
 Afterwards I practised my clarinet    
 until teatime. After tea I cleared the
 table and put the dishes into the     
 dishwasher. At six o'clock I went to  
 Brownies at the Institute where we did
 a picture. My mum picked me up at 8pm.
 Back home I put Alison to bed and read
 her a story. When I came down stairs I
 watched 'Minder' on TV while I had a  
 hot drink.  At 10 past 9 I went to    
 clean my teeth and then read my book  
 in bed. At 9.30 my mum came in to say 
 'Good Night' and soon I was fast      
 asleep.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
