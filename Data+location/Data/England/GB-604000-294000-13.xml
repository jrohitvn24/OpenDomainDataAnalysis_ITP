  On Christmas Eve we had our bath and 
went straight to bed.I hung my pillow  
case up in my bedroom by the radiator  
for Father Christmas to fill and I woke
up at 7 o'clock.My brother has his own 
bedroom and he woke up at 7.17 exactly.
My Mummy and Daddy helped us open our  
presents.My favourite present was a box
of toffees.Father Christmas brought me 
some toys and sweeties.We had two or   
three presents on the Christmas tree.
