		<content> In a limestone area water supply is   
 an issue of significance. The town of 
 Much Wenlock derived its water from a 
 number of wells scattered round the   
 town &amp; which remain today in walls of 
 houses &amp; gardens. Their significance  
 is exemplified in that they are named 
 after saints eg. St. Owens well.      
  The town is served by a stream,Farley
 brook, which rises on the dip slope of
 Wenlock Edge,flows E. into the town &amp; 
 turns to flow N. into R. Severn       
 creating the valley of Farley dingle. 
  Homer obtained water from wells &amp;    
 boreholes. Until the late 1960's Much 
 Wenlock had its own water supply from 
 a tank high on the scarp behind the   
 hospital. With the expansion of Homer 
 the area was connected to the Severn- 
 Trent main.                           
  Many isolated dwellings still obtain 
 water from boreholes.                 </content>
