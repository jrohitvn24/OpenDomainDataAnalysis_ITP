		<content>    Although much post-war housing in  
 the 50's was well suited to the       
{affluent retired,}who constitute{60% }
 of our region's total population,     
 recent limitations have been imposed  
 on further building of this nature.   
 This area has become desireable with  
 an{average price of Â£55,000}and a     
 rateable value of Â£376. Whereas in the
 west{Larkin}has dominated house design
 and building, in the middle and       
 eastern areas contractors from out of 
 town have, in recent years, built     
 properties catering more for young    
{families and the working population,  
 the mean prices being{Â£30,000}and the 
 RV. Â£140, thus creating a different   
 pattern of development. Here too can

{properties}of which{22%}are now
