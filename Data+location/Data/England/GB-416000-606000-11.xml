 Four people live in our house. There's
 Mummy,Daddy,Simon and me.Simon is     
 eighteen months old. Simon and I play 
 chasing each other on the bikes and we
 have great fun. Sometimes Simon falls 
 down and I have to pick him up. I made
 a bird table and Simon eats the bread 
 that I put on the bird table. I       
 say,"No, do not eat that you little   
 menace.Its for the birds." Then Mummy 
 comes out and says,"You would  think  
 that he had not seen food in years."  
 And I  say,"Yes, its a fact."         
 Simon sometimes doesn't eat it.He     
 leaves it on the ground and the dog   
 gets it.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
