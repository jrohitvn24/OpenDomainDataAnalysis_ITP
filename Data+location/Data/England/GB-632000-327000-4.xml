		<content> My dad works on a farm and he raises  
 over 100 young pheasants that are     
 bought from a breeding farm at 2 to 3 
 weeks old, each year. I help him to   
 get the pheasants into a hut to       
 protect them from foxes. I have to    
 debeak them and put them in crates to 
 take down the loke,and put them in    
 another shed. We have to take a       
 heater and a supply of gas and check  
 regularly that they have food and     
 water. When they get a little bigger  
 and roam further afield I walk round  
 to see if there are any poachers      
 around. My dad takes his double       
 barrelled twelve bore gun. We walk    
 down the loke and across the fields   
 and past a wood. Dad and I have       
 disturbed poachers in the past, who   
 have escaped in their cars.
