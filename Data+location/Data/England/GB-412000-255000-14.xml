		<title>14HOUSING, HASELOR, WARKS.</title>
		<content> There have not been many houses built 
 in Haselor over the last 25 years but 
 there have been many conversions. The 
 farm buildings by the side of the     
 village stocks have been converted    
 into 4 dwellings. Mark's house was a  
 granary "because there are two french 
 windows,one in the lounge and one in  
 Mum's bedroom and I know as well      
 because there is a wheel at the bottom
 of the garden from the conveyor belt  
 that reached up into the top french   
 window". The four dwellings are built 
 around the yard and the entrance to   
 them all is through the wide high     
 gateway through which the old         
 fashioned carts piled high with hay   
 would have to pass.The roof of one is 
 at ground level by the side of the    
 path up to the church.
