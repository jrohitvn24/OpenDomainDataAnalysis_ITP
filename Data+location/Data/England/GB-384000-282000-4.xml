The Church of St. Peter stands on the  
cliff high above the village. If you   
have not got a car it is a steep climb.
Originally there was a Norman Church.  
The present tower was built in the     
fourteenth century as was the south    
aisle but there is still the Norman    
west wall and buttresses. In the church
are many more Norman remains. The      
east end is mainly fifteenth century in
the Perpendicular style as is the      
beautiful chapel on the north side of  
the chancel. The north aisle is a      
recent modern addition. There are      
several tombs and memorials of the Grey
Family of Enville and of the owners of 
Stourton Castle.                       
                                       
The church services are well attended. 
The vicar lives in the village.
