		<content>     Although the whole of the Furness 
 area gives evidence of settlement and 
 occupation since pre-historical times,
 very little is known for certain, and 
 there are almost no traces with-in the
 D-Block of pre-Norman life (although  
 the church is named St. Cuthbert's and
 owns a Saxon muniment chest and a     
 Saxon tombstone).                     
          There is a Norman doorway in 
 the church, and there is a mention in 
 the original Domesday Book of         
{"Cherchebi Manor"}(Kirby-in-Furness). 
 The reference,in fact,is believed to  
 relate to the  period  around 1060    
 when it was held by Earl Tostig,      
 brother to King Harold the First-the  
 same brother killed at the battle of  
 Stamford Bridge fighting{against}     
 Harold.
