		<content> The names of Nunriding and Newton     
 Underwood are evidence of extensive   
 woodland formerly, he Fort valley is  
 still filled with wide deciduous      
 woods, very attractive at all times   
 and providing cover for birds. There  
 is no village, but a numer of         
 scattered arms. Mining and quarring   
 have long cased. Nunriding Hall is    
 mostly cornland, with grass for riding
 horses that are bred and trained.     
 Newton Underwood has cattle,          
 sheep,corn Newton Red House has       
 extensive cultivation coupled with    
 grassland improvement. Newton         
 Underwood is a deserted medieval      
 village -  ruinous house remains with 
 tower vault attached. Lightwaer is    
 another mixed farm. The old wheelhouse
 or gingan still stands. The house was 
 probably an inn at one time. The      
 nearest is at Dyke Neuk.              </content>
