		<title>09Ecology Rat On Farm</title>
		<content>    When we went to the farm the farmer
 offered to show us his combine        
 harvester. We all agreed and the      
 farmer warned us that there might be a
 rat or a mouse that might run out from
 underneath the combine.   He started  
 it up and for quite a while nothing   
 happened.  Then just as the farmer was
 going to switch the combine off, out  
 came a rat.   Edward saw it first,    
    "Look over there!" Edward shouted. 
    The rat went straight past us and  
 under a pile of bricks, sand and      
 rubble.   We thought it went behind   
 another pile of sand but we could not 
 find it.   The farmer said we were    
 very lucky to see it.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
