		<title>13LITTLE MERSLEY BARN,POTTERY</title>
		<content>     You are invited to watch Molly    
 Attrill, studio potter, at work at    
 Little Mersley Barn, Newchurch.       
     The pottery was established in    
 1982 and is sited in a converted barn 
 built in 1802.  The pots being        
 displayed in the loft area and the    
 working section and kilns are on the  
 ground floor.                         
     Molly Attrill uses earthenware    
 clay for the most part but takes great
 pride in the fact that she uses some  
 local brick clay.  She makes a variety
 of pots for table, kitchen and        
 garden-pots which give pleasure in    
 everyday use.  90% of the ware is     
 thrown using traditional methods _    
 most fascinating to view.             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
