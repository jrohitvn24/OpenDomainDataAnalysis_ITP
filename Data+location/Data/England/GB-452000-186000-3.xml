		<title>03Roots of East Hagbourne</title>
		<content>East Hagbourne probably dates from     
Roman times but the first written      
record of the name is in a charter of  
King Alfred which refers to "Hacca     
Burn" and "Hacca Broc". The name later 
changed to East Hachbourne when        
mentioned in the Domesday Book.        
In 1659 a fire destroyed most of the   
Mediaeval settlement along Main Road.  
In the early 1840's the common grazing 
right of the villagers was lost and    
land enclosed.                         
In the ninteenth century the London to 
Bristol railway line cut across East   
Hagbourne marsh, and a branch line to  
Newbury divided East and West          
Hagbourne permanently. Today the old   
Newbury Branch is a public footpath but
still represents a barrier to further  
development of Didcot which might      
eventually swallow up East Hagbourne.
