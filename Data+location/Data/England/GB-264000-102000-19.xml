		<content> Bondleigh attributes its peaceful,    
 relaxing environment to the pace of   
 its farming community, wildlife and   
 natural surroundings. Whilst there has
 been a change in the occupancy of many
 of the older premises which have been 
 bought by people from outside the area
 most of the inhabitants are involved  
 in some form of farming activity, an  
 occupation demanding long hours, hard 
 work and dedication.                  
 New faces bring new ideas, not always 
 acceptable to former residents; whilst
 others feel that it is benificial for 
 the local economy, and gives a greater
 understanding of the fulfilments and  
 disappointments experienced by people 
 from varying walks of life. Tolerance 
 of free speech from both sides is to  
 be encouraged, and when this happens, 
 it enriches the culture of the        
 community.                            </content>
