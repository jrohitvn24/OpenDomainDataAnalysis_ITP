		<title>03A COUNTRY PUB</title>
		<content> This is pub, is on a remote road some 
 way from King's Caple, the nearest    
 village. It is run by a man and his   
 wife from Yorkshire, who came here 4  
 years ago because they liked          
 the area, the climate, and the way of 
 life of the people who live here.  At 
 lunch-time there are few customers,   
 but in the evening they have about 10.
 At weekends they get up to 24.   They 
 keep pigs, cattle and poultry, some to
 sell and some for themselves. They    
 also have a site for 5 caravans,      
 registered with the Caravan Club.     
 The regular customers are mostly the  
 older men, farmers and gardeners,     
 very old fashioned, and "are real     
 characters".  If they want to tell a  
 naughty story, they send the landlady 
 into the kitchen.  The younger men go 
 to discos in Hereford, but start      
 drinking here when they get married.  </content>
