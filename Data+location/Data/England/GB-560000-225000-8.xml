		<title>08MR.BERT PICKFORD'S LIFE</title>
		<content> On Thursday 13th June Mr Bert Pickford
 told us about his life in Great       
 Easton.His parents lived in the Bell, 
 which was a public house at that time.
 They had cows and chickens.Every      
 morning he would milk two cows then   
 take them to the field.Then he would  
 take the milk to the houses around    
 Great Easton and his brother to Duton 
 Hill.The milk was in a churn.The      
 housewife would bring out a jam jar   
 and he would fill it up.A 2lb jam jar 
 =1pt. of milk.Then he went to school. 
 After school he would take the cows   
 home and milk them.He left school at  
 14 and went into his father's         
 business.At that time they repaired   
 farm carts and machinery.Later he     
 restored old houses and converted old 
 barns into houses for commuters.
