Two young girls listened to the        
memories of an elderly lady. At school 
the teachers were very strict.         
Children were seen and not heard. The  
lady's favourite subject was reading   
but she hated sewing. The Strood Fair  
came to Station Road once a year. For  
two pennies you could go on almost     
everything.                            
With her friends she played games like 
whip and top and hoop and stick. She   
lived near the dreaded workhouse where 
homeless, ill, or disabled people      
were sent.                             
If she went out with a boy she would   
not dare to tell her mother or else!   
When she was 16 she had to be in by    
nine oclock or else! In 1985 she thinks
the community spirit has gone and life 
is more hostile. Bring back the good   
old days in Rochester!                 </content>
