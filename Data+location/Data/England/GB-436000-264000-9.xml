		<title>09THATCHING - THE STAG'S HEAD.</title>
		<content>{Thatching.                            
     Built in the sixteenth century,   
{The Stag's Head}retained its original 
 thatched roof until 1985. Although    
 parts of the top layers had been      
 patched over the years, 1985 was the  
 first time that the {wheat reed roof  
 had been completely stripped.         
     When all the thatch was removed,  
 it was discovered that some of the    
 roof timbers were just tree branches. 
    {The new roof is made of Norfolk   
{reed}which is tougher than wheat reed 
 and, according to the thatcher, is    
 likely to last at least 60 years.     
    {Three thousand bundles of reed    
 were needed to thatch the roof and the
 total cost of the work, which took    
 three months to complete, was{Â£21,000.
