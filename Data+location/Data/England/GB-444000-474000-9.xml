		<title>09SOFT FRUIT FARMING IN SESSAY</title>
		<content> Many changes have occurred in         
 agriculture this century but none has 
 affected Sessay as much as the advent 
 of the {Pick Your Own}farm.  Here     
 visitors gather the fruit of their    
 choice paying less than market price  
 for the privilege.  Each weekend from 
 June to August pickers, often towns-  
 people having a day out, arrive in    
 their hundreds if the weather is good,
 to pick fruit.  There are two such    
 farms in Sessay making us famous far  
 and wide.  One farmer has put 8 acres 
 down to strawberries and as well as   
 encouraging PYO he has built up a good
 trade with local retailers, hotels etc
 whilst still farming the rest of his  
 land traditionally.                   
 The other enterprise is a{market      
{gardener}whose main crops are rasp-   
 berries, strawberries &amp; blackcurrants 
 as well as many vegetables.           </content>
