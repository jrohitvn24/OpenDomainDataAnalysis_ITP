 "Totnes is a healthy place to live."  
 "It's nice to live near transport ,   
 especially trains."                   
 "We have seen great changes in the    
 area such as a second bridge,prisoners
 and soldiers used as labourers during 
 the war, Follaton houses built in 1930
 and now Follaton Village in 1984-5."  
 "The surrounding land is beautiful."  
 "Many fields have been taken over for 
 building."                            
 "The main street of Totnes is too     
 narrow to shop easily."               
 "The main Plymouth road to Totnes was 
 lined with oak trees. There were only 
 horses and carts, and even they       
 couldn't pass. Now the trees have been
 chopped d own, the road widened and a 
 pavement built."

 Dutch Elm Disease."                   </content>
