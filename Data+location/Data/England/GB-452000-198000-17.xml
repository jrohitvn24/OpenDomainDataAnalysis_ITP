		<content>SKIPPING is more of a sport than a game
as it is also used for keeping fit.    
You need a rope long enough to step    
over when held at either end with out- 
stretched arms;keeping the arms as     
still as possible circle the rope over 
your head either backwards or forwards,
as the rope comes back to your feet    
step or jump over it. There are many   
variations. Many children make up or   
say traditional rhymes to go to this   
movement. KNIVES,FORKS SPOONS is a     
game where a girl stands facing the    
others and says these words and on the 
word "spoons" they all stand on their  
hands and the girl who stays up the    
longest changes places with the girl   
at the front and it carries on. It can 
be played with as few as 3 or as many  
as the girl judging can see at one     
time. There are very few playground    
games compared with old times.         </content>
