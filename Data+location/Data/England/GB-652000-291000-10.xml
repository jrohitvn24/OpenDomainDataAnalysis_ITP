		<title>10A LOWESTOFT CHILD'S DAY</title>
		<content> I normally get up at 7.30 &amp; have toast
&amp; cornflakes for breakfast. I wash &amp;   
and get dressed for school. Mum takes  
me in the car with my friend Lisa. We  
talk in the playground until the       
whistle blows. In class we do English, 
my favourite lesson is Dictionary Work.
Our topic this term is Plants &amp; I have 
just planted my Nasturtiums &amp; have to  
measure them. For lunch I have ham     
sandwiches, crisps &amp; yogurt. In the    
playground Lisa &amp; I play skipping or   
tag. In the afternoon we do Maths &amp;    
have Drama in the hall. After school   
I have gymnastics club, &amp; I help with  
the younger children. When I go home I 
have chips, bacon, beans &amp; ice-cream   
for tea. I go out to play after tea    
until mum calls me in. Then I watch    
television until it is time for bed at 
9 o'clock.
