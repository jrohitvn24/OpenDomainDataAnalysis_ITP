 There are varying types of trees on   
 the farm, the most common being oak   
 and silver birch. The farmer has      
 deliberately kept all the old hedges, 
 only two had been pulled out recently 
 to make one large field out of two    
 smaller ones. The farm house has a    
 lovely cottage garden with a concrete 
 path leading from the gate in the     
 hedge along the road to the front     
 door. The garden also has a vegetable 
 patch, which is well kept and         
 producing vegetables for the house.   
 The vegetables seen growing included  
 runner beans, potatoes, lettuce and   
 cabbage. There was also Rhubarb aand a
 plum tree.
