		<title>19 A Village in W.Stafford.</title>
		<content>                                       
        The only village in our area   
is Derrington (population 1500), it is 
about two miles West of Stafford.We    
interviewed our Deputy Head,Mrs Keeling
who lives there.She said they have     
these facilities:- a church,shop,bus   
service,pub,playing space for children,
youth club and playgroup,but they do   
not have a Doctor,Dentist,bank,public  
park or school.                        
        The village has changed,       
because many years ago there were only 
about four cottages and a farm.The     
church is about 160 years.             
        Some of the old houses have had
new houses built around them,then the  
old house taken down.Now most of the   
houses are new and have been built in  
the last twenty years.Most people work 
outside of the village.
