     {RUNOUTS -}You have about ten     
 people and you group into five. You   
 send five people to count to 50.      
 Try to catch them before getting to a 
 fence which is home.If they get three 
 home they run out again.If we catch   
 them,then we have a turn to run out.  
      {BRITISH BULLDOG -}One person is 
 chosen.There is a wall or fence etc.  
 each side of the playground or field. 
 You have to get from one side to the  
 other side without the person who is  
 chasing you. If you get caught you    
 join the person who is chasing the    
 people who are playing.
