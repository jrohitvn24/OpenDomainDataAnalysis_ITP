		<content> When we arrived at the cottage.It     
 was windy but bright and warm.We could
 see that the land was covered with    
 scattered trees and crops.When we     
 walked through the arch. We could see 
 the golf course and the hatchery and  
 avenues of lime trees. The distance   
 between the trees was 9.1m and the    
 distance from the trees was 18m.Sheep 
 had grazed in the field. They had     
 eaten them away at their height .The  
 Oaks and Sweet Chestnuts were the     
 biggest trees and were about 300 years
 old.There were lots of dead tree      
 stumps.We could see the lake from     
 where we were.There were some dredging
 machines.Behind the lake we could see 
 Burghley house.It was facing south so 
 that it would receive sunshine.The    
 chimneys looked like towers.The trees 
 by the house were conifers.In front of
 the lake sheep were grazing.          </content>
