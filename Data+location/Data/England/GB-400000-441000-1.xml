		<content> The area covered by D-block is mostly 
 high rough grassland or moorland used 
 for grazing of sheep or for silage.The
 highest point is 350m above sea level.
  The edges of the villages of Laycock,
 Braithwaite and Sutton figure in the  
 area but apart from that,the only     
 settlements are farmhouses of which   
 there are about 20.All the villages   
 are linked by steep winding lanes and 
 eventually to Keighley.There are few  
 amenities in the block except a school
 and a chapel in Braithwaite and a pub,
 garage and shop in Sutton.            
  Several streams serve the area which 
 is millstone grit.Waterlogging occurs,
  although due to the slopes,          
 the water flows into the valley.There 
 is a reservoir and also Redcar Tarn.  
  Places of interest are Sutton Clough 
 and Redcar Tarn.
