  A group of six children attending    
Kingsbrook School,Stratford Road,      
Deanshanger,Northants. were            
interviewed to try and find out about  
their attitudes to their lives futures 
and surroundings.                      
  They were nearing the end of their   
fourth year at the school and would be 
taking public exams the following      
summer,after which most of them        
would be leaving school.Some 700       
children attended the school.They all  
agreed they were happy at school and   
fortunate to have good facilities and  
a good working atmosphere.They felt    
that their school benefitted from      
being outside the city of Milton       
Keynes,in a village setting,and from   
drawing its children from similar      
village backgrounds.They felt that     
they belonged to the school.           </content>
