		<content> This area contains the settlement     
 known as Weston which is made up of   
 several different residential zones.  
 The most modern residential area is   
 known as Courtlands, or the Navy      
 estate, and this houses many families 
 connected with the Navy. There is a   
 council estate known as Pound Piece   
 and an area of older terraced houses  
 known as Channel View.  The area has  
 two buildings of interest one very    
 old and the other very new. The old   
 building is St.George's church built  
 in the style of Christopher Wren using
 local stone. The church is no longer  
 used for worship but it is open to the
 public and some recent restoration has
 taken place.  The new building is the 
 Royal Manor Comprehensive School      
 completed on the site of the old      
 secondary school and officially opened
 in 1986.                              </content>
