		<content>   In the olden days children went to  
 school in what is now the Art Centre. 
 One of the pupils, Mr Cheesman spoke  
 to us.                                
   The school day was 9 o'clock to 12  
 o'clock and then 1.15 to 4 o'clock and
 everyone went home for lunch.In school
 time they did maths, mental arithmetic
 English,singing,geography and history.
   There were 7 classes with about 30  
 children in each class.There were 8   
 teachers,one for each class and the   
 Head Master.They had to teach the     
 children about everything,they did not
 have any specialist teachers.         
   All the children from Cranleigh     
 walked to school but others from      
 out_lying farms came by horse_drawn   
 cart.                                 
   For a special outing they took the  
 train to the seaside and were back for
 tea.  We cannot do this now!          </content>
