		<content>  {Interview:Mr.and Mrs.Smith (cont'd) 
  When asked about{"Thwaite Hall"}we   
 were told that thwaite was a Norwegian
 word meaning "clearing in the wood"   
 which made the woods where the Hall is
 still seen very old.Mr.Smith thought  
 that it was possibly a farm run and   
 worked by monks in the middle ages.It 
 is now being converted into a shooting
 lodge by Mr.Roughton.                 
              {Changes }               
  When asked about changes in the      
 village since they had moved in,they  
 both thought the noise had increased, 
 because more vehicles used the roads  
 in the village,there were more houses 
 and small fields had been made bigger 
 by removing hedges.{Clover Dairies,   
 a thriving dairy giving work to the   
 community,had disappeared and with it 
 the enormous chimney there.
