		<title>19Heathland, Bridgham</title>
		<content> The Nature Conservancy Council,       
 concerned about the loss of heathland 
 (mostly to commercial farming) has    
 recently taken over part of Brettenham
 and Bridgham heaths, part of the      
 diminishing Norfolk Breckland.  The   
 Council will provide a continuing site
 and habitat for the varied native     
 grasses, wild flowers, insects and    
 birds and to ensure this, public      
 access to the heath has been          
 restricted. The sandy, heather covered
 wilds of the brecks are believed to   
 have come about as a result of intense
 but short term farming practices,     
 firstly by early farmers seeking      
 easily worked soils and secondly by   
 hungry sheep.                         
                                       
 The ancient Peddars Way track crosses 
 this area and is increasingly popular 
 with walkers.                         </content>
