		<content>    The Guest House serves coffees and 
 teas,and also provides bed and        
 breakfast for visitors. It opens at 10
 a.m., and closes again at 5.30p.m.    
 People have come from all over the    
 world- France, Netherlands,           
 Germany,New Zealand and the U.S.A.    
    There are 4 bedrooms. For breakfast
 they offer grapefruit,fruit           
 juice,bacon,egg,tomato,fried bread and
 wholemeal rolls. Supplies come from a 
 Cash and Carry in Birmingham.         
    They advertise in magazines,but    
 guests often recommend them to friends
 by word of mouth.                     
    The Guest House is approved by the 
 Heart of England Tourist Board, but,  
 before they could be approved, they   
 had to answer such questions as,"Is   
 the house fully carpeted? Have you got
 showers? Is there hot and cold water  
 in the rooms,and central heating?"    </content>
