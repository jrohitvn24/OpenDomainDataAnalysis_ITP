		<title>09KIRTON CHURCH</title>
		<content> The church in Kirton dates from the   
 twelfth and thirteenth centuries, it  
 is called "Holy Trinity". The building
 is situated at the northern end of the
 village. There is some Medieval       
 stained glass in one of the windows,  
 and if you look at the pillars that   
 separate the north and south aisles   
 from the nave you can see a circle of 
 stone, these were the original seats. 
 The church has tubular bells and the  
 font is over 600 hundred years old,   
 the same age as the church itself.
