		<content> The district in the project is a rural
 one and as such does not offer        
 a complete service within the         
 area.Both Croft and Stoney Stanton    
 have primary schools with community   
 centres attached.These schools are    
 modern having being built in the late 
 1960s and early 1970s.Children attend 
 these primary schools from the ages of
 five to eleven.The children in Croft  
 then attend a high school at Enderby  
 and the children at Stoney Stanton    
 attend a high school in Hinckley.At   
 the age of 14 the Croft children then 
 attend Lutterworth Grammar School     
 while the Stoney Stanton children go  
 on to the Hinckley community          
 college.There is in the county a      
 comprehensive system of               
 education.Although there are still    
 the old names ,the titles should not  
 be taken at face value.               </content>
