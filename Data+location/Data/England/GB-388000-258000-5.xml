 Wychavon District Council has bought  
 Lower Smite from the owner of The     
 Woodlands in order to turn it into a  
 refuse tip. This has caused contoversy
 in the past,and may do so again on    
 ecological grounds.The Martin

 what was{Hindlip Hall.}There are three
 buildings.The first was used for      
 washing,the second for ironing and    
 the third was used for airing.Over the

 built in 1910 and were recently       
 restored,and turned into a house.
