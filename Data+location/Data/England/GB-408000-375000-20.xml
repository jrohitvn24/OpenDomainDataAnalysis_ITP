 swimming pool in the afternoon.The    
 swimming pool had a diving board and

 took part in football and rounders    
 competitions.We lost in the finals of 
 both.                                 
  On Tuesday we shopped in Mundesley   
 and played on the beach and in the    
 park.In the evening there was a fancy 
 dress competition and some of us      
 dressed up.                           
  On Wednesday we had to pack up our   
 things ready to come home.We set off  
 from Mundesley at half past eleven    
 and got home at quarter past six.

 we enjoyed ourselves,but we were      
 pleased to be home.
