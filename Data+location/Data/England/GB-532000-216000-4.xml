		<content>Davies Magnet have been established    
here since the 1960's manufacturing    
fifth wheel couplings,trailer landing  
gear and other items for articulated   
truck haulage.                         
The company was making magnetic mining 
equipment in the back garden of the    
family home in north London. They began
to make fifth wheel couplings after Mr.
Davies' brother returned with the idea 
from Canada after 1945.                
The market has expanded dramatically   
and there are only five firms making   
the same piece of equipment in the UK. 
Although they are the smallest of these
firms, they regard themselves as making
the'Rolls-Royce'version of their       
product They are facing severe         
competition from the USA, Germany and  
other European countries. So despite a 
growing market, they are half the size 
they were in 1980.                     </content>
