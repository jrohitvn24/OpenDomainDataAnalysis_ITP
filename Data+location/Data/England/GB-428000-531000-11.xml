		<title>11Land Reclamation(Ferryhill)</title>
		<content> Some of the land in our area has      
 undergone considerable change in      
 recent years following the decline and
 closure of hevy industry sites.       
 The main feature in Ferryhill has been
 the landscaping of the old Dean and   
 Chapter pit-heap following the closure
 of the colliery in 1965.The pit-heap  
 was levelled,grassed and had quick    
 growing trees such as willow,alder and
 rowan planted on it.                  
 The land is still owned by the NCB but
 now offers a far pleasanter view than 
 before.The old pit yard has also been 
 renovated and now houses a small      
 haulage complex run by Sedgefield     
 District Council.                     
 The old railway line once used to     
 transport coal from the pit has now   
 returned to nature providing a suit-  
 able habitat for a wide range of plant
 and animal life.                      </content>
