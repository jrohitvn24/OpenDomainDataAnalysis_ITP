		<content>    We surveyed three schools in the   
 western part of the D-Block. Here are 
 some things we found out.             
   {Northcliffe School}is a private    
 school, situated near the junction of 
 the M27 and M271. Before the motorway 
 was built it was an isolated rural    
 school. The building is called{Grove  
{Place}and there is a long, tree-lined 
 drive to the entrance.                
    We were told by the headmaster,Mr  
 David Owens, that the school was      
 opened in 1965. There are{114 pupils} 
 and{10 teachers}. The largest class   
 has 17 pupils and the smallest has 10.
 The pupils board at the school and    
 wear school uniform. There are some   
 day pupils who come by bus and cars.  
    The school has a playing field, a  
 library, swimming pool, four pianos,  
 four computers, a tv and video. They  
 do not hold school discos.            </content>
