  The old{Coates Endowed Middle School 
 building is situated at the corner of 
 where North Road and Main Road meet.  
 The engraving on the side of the      
 building reads: 'Ponteland School     
 Endowed by{Richard Coates}Anno Domini 
 1719 rebuilt 1831.'                   
  When Richard Coates died he left the 
 income from eleven houses and a Smithy
 in trust to pay annuites to his wife  
 and sister, the remainder to be used  
 as the erection of a single storyed   
 school in{Ponteland.                  
  Pupils atending the school were      
 supplied with clothing consisting of  
 grey coats and caps for boys, maneux  
 and petticoats for girls.Children     
 began at the age of seven and finished
 at the age of eleven.                 
  Now it is owned by{Glover and Humble 
 who use it as an estate agent.        </content>
