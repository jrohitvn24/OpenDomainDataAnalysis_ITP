		<content>   The block contains some relatively  
 mature woodland, e.g.{Barrack Wood}and
{Holden's Wood,}although tree height   
 and species composition is not as     
 mature as in Weald park further north,
 where large Oaks are dominant. Some { 
{Oaks}occur in the block, however, and 
 are likely to emerge as dominants, in 
 association with{Beech.}Quadrat       
 sampling in the woodland revealed     
 distinct clustering of certain tree   
 species. In one location {Beech}was   
 the most numerous, in another{Sweet   
{Chestnut}and in a third (atypically){ 
{Corsican Pine.}The relative maturity  
 of the woodlands in reflected in the  
 lack of ground cover: in the quadrats 
 only 9.4% of the ground was actually  
 covered with vegetation - the most    
 common cover being{moss}and{grass,    
 followed by{ferns, bracken, bluebells,
{angelica,ivy,nettles}and{brambles.    </content>
