		<title>02THE VILLAGE OF COMBROOK.</title>
		<content> In the north of our area lies         
 Combrook,to be reached by following a 
 spur off the Fossway.The village was  
 once part of Kineton.From the top of  
 Pittern Hill, you descend to          
 Combrook,possibly the most secluded   
 village in the whole of               
 Warwickshire.Most of the houses date  
 from the nineteenth and twentieth     
 centuries.The village became a        
 separate parish in 1853 and hence it  
 is not surprising to note that the    
 architecture of the church is "free   
 Gothic" and dating largely from       
 1866.For a long time the village was  
 part of the Verney estate,based upon  
 the stately home of Compton           
 Verney,home of the Willoughby de      
 Broke's.Unfortunately the house has   
 been allowed to fall into disrepair   
 and is at the time of writing up for  
 sale.                                 </content>
