		<title>09Wringworthy Farm.(contd.)</title>
		<content>  In summer all his cattle are in the  
 fields but in the winter all the young
 calves are indoors in sheds.The dairy 
 cows are allowed to wander freely in  
 and out of the stockyard and the      
 cowshed.His beef cattle are the male  
 calves of his dairy cows.The female   
 calves he keeps to replace his dairy  
 cows.The beef cattle are kept until   
 their second autumn when they are sold
 to lowland farmers for fattening as   
 this is a moorland farm and the land  
 is too high for fattening cattle.The  
 beef cattle stay outside all year on  
 his land near Mary Tavy.There is some 
 woodland here so they have some       
 protection in winter.In summer the    
 farmer has silage and hay to cut and  
 calves to feed.In winter the farmer   
 spends most of his day feeding and    
 cleaning out his stock.
