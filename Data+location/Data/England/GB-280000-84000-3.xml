		<content> On 16th December 1948 the village     
 school at Bridford closed and the 12  
 children in attendance at the time    
 were transported to Christow.         
 Christow is still the catchment school
 for the children of Bridford after 37 
 years.                                
 At present there are 75 children on   
 roll, a headteacher and two assistant 
 full-time teachers and one part-time  
 teacher.  Class 1 has 19 children,    
 Class 2 has 28 and Class 3 has 28     
 also.  The children start school the  
 term in which they are 5 and leave at 
 11 years.  Most transfer to the       
 comprehensive school at Kingsteignton 
 and a few to other private schools in 
 the vicinity.
