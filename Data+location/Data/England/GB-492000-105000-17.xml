		<content> The Parish Council representative     
 reported on the A.G.M. of the sports  
 Council which had taken place on the  
 26th April.Faced with the threat of   
 the closure of the sports field,      
 volunteers had come forward,albeit    
 reluctantly with offers of help and   
 support.It had been generally agreed  
 that the hire charges were far too low
 and these were to be reviewed.
