		<title>17THE BREWERY IN ERPINGHAM</title>
		<content> Amasingly Erpingham has its own       
 brewery.This is situated in an        
 outbuilding attached to the Spread    
 Eagle public house.                   
   The brewery reflects the increased  
 popularity of "real ale" in Norfolk.  
 The brewers produce several types of  
 bitter,mainly called Woodfords which  
 they now sell throughout East Anglia. 
   One ale is called Phoenix Bitter    
 following a fire which almost closed  
 the brewery in its early days.
