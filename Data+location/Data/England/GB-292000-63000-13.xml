		<title>13Children's games at school</title>
		<content> In school children play lots of       
 different games such as:              
 Bulldog,Elastics,Pod and Hide and     
 Seek.                                 
     Bulldog. This is a game where any 
 amount of people can play.One child   
 stands in front and shouts            
 "bulldog".The children opposite run   
 and try not to be caught by the child 
 alone.This carries on until all       
 children are caught.                  
     Hide and Seek. This is where one  
 child counts up to a certain number   
 and the other children go and hide.The
 child who counted then goes to find   
 the children who hid.                 
     Pod. This is very like Hide and   
 Seek except that there is a race to   
 see who gets to the counting place    
 first.                                
     Elastics.  This is just a piece of
 elastic tide to two posts for jumping.</content>
