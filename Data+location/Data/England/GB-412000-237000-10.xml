		<content> There are three schools in Campden, St
 Catharine's R.C.Primary, St James C of
 E Primary and the secondary Chipping  
 Campden School. The first two schools 
 are "aided" which means that the State
 provides the teachers' salaries and an
 allowance for the children's books and
 apparatus but the Governors provide   
 and maintain the buildings. Primary   
 schools accept children from the age  
 of 5 years. At 11 years they attend   
 Campden School and are educated until 
 they are 16 or beyond if they are     
 sitting A level exams. Campden School 
 is large with 800 pupils and 50       
 teachers.It is comprehensive and takes
 all children from a wide area,        
 regardless of abilities.St James is an
 old Campden school with new premises, 
 St Catharine's and Campden School were
 modernised and added to. About 1000   
 pupils attend the schools in Campden. </content>
