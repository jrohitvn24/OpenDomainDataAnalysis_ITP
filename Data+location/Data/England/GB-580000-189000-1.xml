 The Rayleigh survey grid covers a pre-
 dominately surburban area close to and
 adjoining Southend but also within    
 commuting distance of London.Historic-
 ally the town can prove architectural 
 remains which show settlement in      
 Norman times (Rayleigh Mount) but the 
 real impetus to growth came in the    
 late 19th century with the opening of 
 the railway line linking Southend     
 Victoria with London Liverpool Street 
 since when Rayleigh has grown to have 
 a population of 27,000.Modern lines of
 communication place the town not only 
 on the now electrified rail line but  
 also on the dual carriageway A127     
 London Southend trunk route which puts
 Rayleigh only 16 miles away from the  
 M25 motorway. Chelmsford,Canvey and   
 Basildon are also important sources of
 local employment and commerce.        </content>
