		<content>      In Marden village we still have  
 our own blacksmith, Mr. Don Rogers.   
 His family have had their Smithy on   
 the same site for almost 200 years.   
 Mr. Rogers is the last of the line of 
 smiths in his family and when he      
 closes the doors then it will be the  
 end of a long tradition. The family   
 were renowned farriers and won many   
 competitions in the horse fairs,      
 county shows and other events. Shoeing
 horses is a minor part of his work    
 now, most of his time is spent in     
 doing specialist welding contracts for
 the Gas and Water Boards and in       
 agricultural repairs.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
