		<title>03STARRICKS FARM</title>
		<content> This farm is a dairy producing farm   
 and is sixty acres in size.It faces   
 South and gets more sunlight .The     
 farmer owns twenty six cows and only  
 three of them are for beef.The cows   
 are milked twice a day,once at six    
 o'clock in the morning and again a    
 four o' clock in the afternoon. Each  
 milking lasts about an hour.In one day
 four hundred litres of milk are       
 produced which means that on average a
 cow gives twenty two and a half litres
 approximately. A good, young cow can  
 give about fifty litres. This milk    
 goes to the creamery at Kendal.While  
 being milked  the cows eat dairy      
 pencil which is a piece of barley     
 shaped like a pencil.Also they eat    
 hay. This is grown in the meadows     
 during the Spring and at the          
 beginning of June it is cut.(cont)
