		<title>16PAST AND PRESENT, HOCKLIFFE</title>
		<content> A recently retired villager well      
 remembers a self sufficient village in
 the{1930s,}when Hockliffe had its own 
{butcher, slaughterer, bakers, tailor  
 and{blacksmith.}Today it has just a   
{grocers}and a{Post Office}including a 
{newsagents.} Prices too have changed, 
 bread was{1p}a loaf and now its{44p.  
 Houses stand on the old shop sites.   
 Until{1931}children were able to play 
 in the street{(A5)}then the road was  
 widened and traffic increased. There  
 was a decrease in traffic when the{M1 
 was opened in the{60s.}Residents used 
 to get their water from pumps and     
 wells. Hockliffe was not put on mains 
 water until{World War Two.} Many found
 jobs outside the village in the{30s   
 when they had to walk, bike or get a  
 lift on a horse and cart.  Today most 
 people still work outside the village 
 but travel by car.                    </content>
