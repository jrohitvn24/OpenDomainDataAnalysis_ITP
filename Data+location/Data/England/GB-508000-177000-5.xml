		<content>  The park once belonged to the old    
 house owned by the Berkeleys.The      
 Astons sold it to the Berkeleys and   
 they lived in it until fifty years ago
 but then it became a ruin.All that is 
 left are the stables at the back of   
 the church.The park has a wall round  
 it which is over 200 years old.Now the
 M4 motorway goes through part of it.  
 The park was the Berkeleys garden and 
 groups of gardeners planted trees.    
 They looked after it but it has grown 
 wild now.The River Crane flows through
 the park.It has many kinds of deciduo-
 us and evergreen trees.Such as Oak,Ash
 Sycamore,Hornbeam,Copperbeach,Poplar  
 Horsechestnut,Silver Birch,Yew,Pine   
 and Laurel. There are also some Elm   
 saplings which are quite rare because 
 most of the Elms were wiped out by    
 Dutch Elm disease.
