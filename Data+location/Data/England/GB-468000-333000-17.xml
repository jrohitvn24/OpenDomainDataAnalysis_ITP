		<content> The school is C of controlled, closely
 linked with the parish church.There   
 are 50 children(5-11yrs)with 2 and a  
 half teachers.It is built of          
 attractive grey stone and belongs to  
 the estate. It looks like a house and 
 has 2 classrooms with oak beams:the   
 big one has an open fire.There is a   
 kitchen,a cloakroom and an            
 extension.We still ring the original  
 bell which stands outside the door.The
 toilets are outside and we like to run
 across the yard where we play netball.
 We also have a 2 acre playing field   
 for football and rounders and the use 
 of an orchard.In summer we go down the
 farmer's fields to the dens in the old
 willow trees which the top sections   
 have had for years.The younger        
 children have dens nearer the school  
 in the hollows under the hedge.
