		<content>No public transport passes through the 
valley but a private bus service calls 
once a day en route from Essex to      
Sevenoaks.Local amenities such as the  
inn,the "Rising Sun",&amp; the leisure cen-
tres rely on customers using their own 
transport.However the new motorway,M20 
traverses two of the squares on the map
but has mainly been constructed through
the unpopulated part of the area. The  
main road which runs through the valley
goes through to Longfield with minor   
lanes leading off.Brands Hatch Racing  
circuit is just over the border but a  
runway for light aircraft has been made
together with an overflow carpart for  
race meetings. The nearest railway     
station is at Longfield approx 2 miles 
away.
