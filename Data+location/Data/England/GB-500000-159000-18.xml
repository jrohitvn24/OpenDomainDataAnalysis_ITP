		<title>18Sarisa's Sunday in Woking.</title>
		<content>  I am 7 years old. On Sunday, June 2nd
 I woke up at 7.30am. Daddy, Mummy and 
 Andrew woke up at 8am. Andrew and I   
 got dressed and watched two programmes
 on Television. We all ate breakfast,  
 toast and boiled eggs or Marmite. We  
 drank tea.                            
  Andrew and I went out to play in the 
 garden. I rode my bike. Andrew cleaned
 the rabbit hutch. Daddy was sanding   
 down a door. Mummy was cooking lunch. 
 Mummy, Andrew and I went swimming. The
 water in the pool was cold. We came   
 home and we all had lamb chops,       
 potatoes and spring greens.           
  My aunt, uncle and cousin visited us.
 We played with my cousin,roller-skated
 and ate orange ice lollies. For tea we
 had pizzas,milk, raspberry pie and ice
 cream. They left in the evening. I    
 played with my rabbit, Fluff, and then
 went to bed.                          </content>
