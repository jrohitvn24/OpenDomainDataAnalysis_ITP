		<title>13CATON SCHOOL OF EQUITATION</title>
		<content>The present building was completed in  
1953 and opened as a riding school in  
1973, but there has been a riding      
school in that immediate area since    
much earlier.The first owner of the    
riding school was Mr Thornton.The      
present owner is Mr Wilson.The school  
has about 20 horses,most of which are  
cross-bred,but some of the pure breeds 
are Welsh Mountain,Arab,Shetland Pony. 
Out in the fields in Summer the horses 
eat grass.In the winter they eat pony  
nuts and hay,which they are given      
twice a day.The school does not train  
its own horses but buys them at an age 
of 9 or 10 years.A horse is not ready  
for training until it is about 4 years 
old, but even then it is too frisky for
learner riders until about 8 years     
old.Each week,about 80 people attend   
the school,which has a jumping arena   
and cross-country course.              </content>
