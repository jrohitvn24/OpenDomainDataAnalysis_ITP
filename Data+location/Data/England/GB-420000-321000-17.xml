		<content>1. SILLIES-Two equal sides,one side is 
on, the others run.When a runner is    
ticked by an 'on' person,the runner    
must stand by the wall and wait to be  
ticked by another runner.Those 'on'    
must try to prevent this.When all the  
runners are ticked,they then become the
side which is 'on'.                    
2.TICK- A person is 'on' and when the  
'on' person ticks another then that    
person is 'on'.                        
3.ROTTEN EGGS OR BALL TICK- A person is
chosen to be 'on'.The others are       
runners.One of the runners throws the  
ball as far away as possible from the  
'on' person.All the runners disperse   
quickly.The 'on' person retrieves the  
ball and shouts 'stop'.The runners     
stand still and the 'on' person tries  
to hit a runner with the ball.If the   
ball hits a runner,that runner becomes 
'on'.If it misses the game is repeated.</content>
