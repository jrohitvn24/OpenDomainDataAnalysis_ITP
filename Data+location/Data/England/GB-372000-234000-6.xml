		<content> Foresters are employed on the Eastnor 
 and Bromesberrow estates, they run the
 woodlands on a commercial basis. The  
 woodlands are carefully maintained and
 systematically replanted and are mixed
 hardwoods and softwoods. The softwoods
 including larch and spruce are felled 
 when the hardwoods such as chestnut,  
 oak and cherry are well established.  
 The foresters have problems with      
 foxes, badgers, rabbits and squirrels 
 which have to be controlled.          
 The Bromesberrow Nurseries produce    
 various plants and flowers for the    
 commercial market. Varieties include  
 fuschias and pelegoniums, which are   
 grown in twenty-one heated            
 greenhouses. The Nurseries also house 
 the largest private collection of     
 orchids in England. The orchidist     
 specialises in producing plants for   
 shows, but some are sold commercially.</content>
