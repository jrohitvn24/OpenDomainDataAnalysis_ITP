		<title>13Botany Bay Farm</title>
		<content> The{Teale}family have been farming in 
 this area since 1939.Mr. Bill Teale   
 has been farming all his life and sons
 Joe and Peter and grandson David all  
 work the farm together.The farm covers
{110 acres}and is mainly under{barley  
 and wheat.They also grow{potatoes,oats
{sugar beet}and{clover}for stock       
 feeding.They have some permanent grass
 for grazing{25 cattle}(Herefords and  
 Limousin) and{70 ewes}and lambs.The   
 biggest changes in Bill's             
 lifetime has been the{mechanisation}of
 farming. There are no longer any jobs 
 to do with crops that are done by     
 hand.The old farm buildings are       
 disappearing and being replaced by    
 larger pre-fabricated buildings to    
 house the large machinery now needed  
 in farming.Fields are becoming larger 
 and{hedgerows disappearing.
