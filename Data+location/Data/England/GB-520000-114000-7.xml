		<title>07OUR VILLAGE MUSEUM, HENFIELD</title>
		<content>   Our Museum shows the local history  
 of our village.  It is all housed in a
 small room in the Village Hall.  When 
 I visited this museum it was a        
 Saturday morning.  It was not very    
 busy which was a pity.  Much on       
 display was connected with agriculture
 and village life.  I saw a clay pipe. 
 There was a horse gag which was used  
 to depress the horse's tongue so      
 medicine could be given - it looked   
 cruel.  There were sheep shears and a 
 Bowman's saw.  One display showed a   
 stained glass window made in Sussex.  
 I liked a wax doll dated 1760.  It    
 wore a long dress and a necklace and  
 had a straw hat.  There was also a    
 model of a broad-wheeled Sussex wagon.
 There were also some signs from the   
 old railway station closed by Dr.     
 Beechins.  There is plenty to see and 
 displays are changed quite regularly. </content>
