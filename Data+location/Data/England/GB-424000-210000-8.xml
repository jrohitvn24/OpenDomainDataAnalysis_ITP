		<title>08Living in Swinbrook - 1985</title>
		<content>Few of the indigenous population still 
live in the parish of Swinbrook.The    
majority are professional people,many  
of whom are retired.Many cottages form 
second  or weekend accommodation so    
that owners seldom take part in village
life.With only six children of school  
age and under and few young adults     
Village Hall activities like the       
Women's Institute and Bingo are largely
supported by folk from other villages. 
The Cricket Club prospers with five    
Swinbrook residents playing for the    
team.The church draws its congregation 
from adjoining parishes as well as from
Swinbrook.A bi-monthly magazine the    
Â£Swinbrook Chronicle' forms the        
information link between a scattered   
community.Papers are delivered six days
and milk three days a week.Mr. Fish on 
Wheels and the greengrocer come once a 
week and the Mobile Library fortnightly</content>
