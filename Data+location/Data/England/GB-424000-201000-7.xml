		<title>07Blinds at Clanfield Mill</title>
		<content>  At the Mill at Little Clanfield there
is a small company that makes and fits 
window blinds. The owner works thirteen
hours a day and he employs ten people  
who work eight hours a day each.       
  It takes on about half an hour to    
make a roller blind.He also makes      
vertical blinds and shop window        
canopies. They use saws, cutting tables
,sharp knives and sewing machines to   
make them. In the first six months of  
1985 they used over five hundred metres
of material.Cotton, wood and aluminium 
are used in the construction of the    
blinds.The only accidents in the       
factory in the first six months of 1985
have been burnt fingers and a bad back.
  The blinds are advertised in the     
local press and by a mobile trailer at 
local events.Two vans and a car are    
used to deliver the blinds which are   
then fitted by one of the staff.       </content>
