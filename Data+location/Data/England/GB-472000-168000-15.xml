		<title>15EGG PRODUCTION RESEARCH</title>
		<content>  Lane End Farm Shinfield is part of   
 Reading University.The people who work
 there are experimenting into          
 increasing egg production. In order to
 achieve this they are looking into    
 chicken food and lighting patterns.In 
 the unit there are 12 separate rooms  
 each filled with a number of cages.In 
 each cage there is one chicken.The    
 amount and type of food can thus be   
 regulated and recorded in relation to 
 egg production.                       
  By keeping the chickens in darkened  
 rooms all the time the scientists are 
 able to control the amount of         
 artificial light allowed to them in   
 each 24 hour period.The scientists    
 have found that by increasing the     
 amount of "daylight" in each 24 hours 
 (thus simulating the longer days of   
 springtime) they are able to increase 
 egg production.                       </content>
