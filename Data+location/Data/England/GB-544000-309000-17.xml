		<title>17NORFOLK STREET,WISBECH.</title>
		<content> Norfolk Street is a narrow shopping   
 thoroughfare on the edge of the main  
 business district of the town.It is   
 the home for many small and useful    
 concerns. In recent years it has been 
 suggested that the street be          
 pedestrianised to alleviate the       
 problems caused by the narrowness of  
 the street.If Norfolk Street was      
 changed it would another chapter in   
 the story of this area of the town.   
 In 1820 Norfolk St.was known as       
 Timber Market(because it was paved    
 with Timber blocks).Among the         
 businesses to be found then were      
 butchers,shoe-makers,confectioners,fur
 niture-brokers,grocers,bakers,basket-m
 akers,blacksmiths,book-sellers,       
 brewers,chemists,tea-dealers,rope-make
 rs and saddlers.                      
 Today as in 1820 the street has a     
 variety of shops and businesses.      </content>
