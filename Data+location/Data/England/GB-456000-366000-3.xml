		<content>   In the N.W.of the block is a group  
 of buildings used today as a community
 centre.The principal part of the      
 complex is a Tudor barn,though much of
 the rest dates back to the 13th.      
 century,forming part of the Medieval  
 manor house where the Lord of the     
 Manor of Warsop would have lived.     
   In the 16th.century the manor was   
 improved and today it still has       
 beautiful Tudor mullioned windows,said
 to be the finest in the country!      
   Many years later the building,then  
 called Old Hall Farm,belonged to the  
 FitzHerbert family.This family sold   
 the Hall to the Urban District Council
 and,with the help of the Notts.       
 Building Preservation Trust and       
 contributions from local people,the   
 Old Hall was converted into a         
 community centre in 1974.It is the    
 venue for many local activities.      </content>
