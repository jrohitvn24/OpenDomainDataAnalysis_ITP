		<title>05CHARLBURY'S GLOVE INDUSTRY</title>
		<content> In 1968 the Gloving Industry ended in 
Charlbury.For 140 years it had been one
of the main sources of employment.     
 Gloveresses used to hand sew gloves in
villages on the edge of the Wychwood   
Forest.In Charlbury some men were also 
involved.Deer and sheep from the nearby
Cotswolds meant a lot of available     
skins.One person acted as a "Glove     
Carrier" taking and collecting the     
finished gloves.                       
  In 1830 there were 5 families in     
Charlbury running Glove Businesses.The 
largest Business employed about 1,000  
people and the premises were in Market 
Street.One of the premises used to be  
where the Youth Hostel is now and the  
houses up Hundley Way are where the    
workers used to live.There was another 
premises in the Old Post House which is
now a Hairdressers.Many of the original
Businesses had to close due to the War.</content>
