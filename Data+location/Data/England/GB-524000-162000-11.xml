		<content> There are roughly 9O parks in the     
 Sutton area. There are 2 gardeners for
 small parks and 4 in bigger parks. We 
 use college and university students   
 for extra help in the summer. We get  
 some vandals. Mostly it is boisterous 
 enthusiasm, but there are some        
 malicious vandals that go into the    
 parks at night and damage the         
 buildings and flower beds.            
   Not all parks have swings and       
 slides, some are just open spaces with
 trees and grass.                      
   We grow a great many flowers, about 
 4O different types. Seven parks have  
 cafes and the most popular park is    
 Oaks Park. My favourite park is The   
 Grove,Carshalton because of its ponds.
 The RSPCA use the ponds to rehabili-  
 tate sick ducks prior to going out    
 into the wild again.(Dave Brown,Parks 
 and Training Co-ordinator, Sutton).   </content>
