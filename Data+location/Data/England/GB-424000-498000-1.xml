   This is an area of gently rolling   
 hills,mainly used as farmland.Barley  
 is grown extensively,and some wheat.  
 Much of the grassland is cut and      
 turned into silage or hay for the     
 winter feeding of herds of Friesian   
 cattle.                               
    The largest village is Scorton ,set
 around a raised green,and there are   
 smaller settlements at Whitwell,the   
 Forest and Bolton-on-Swale.The main   
 buildings in Scorton incude St.John of
 God's Hospital,the Grammar School,two 
 shops and the Institute.              
    Close to the River Swale are large 
 deposits of gravel.The quarries near  
 Ellerton are now closed and the       
 resulting lakes are used by fishermen 
 and as sanctuaries for wild birds,but 
 gravel is still being extracted from  
 the Scorton quarries.                 </content>
