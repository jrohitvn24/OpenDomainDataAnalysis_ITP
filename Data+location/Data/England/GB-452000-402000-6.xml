		<title>06THE MILKMAN</title>
		<content> Bert is a school milkman.He delivers  
 to 630 customers every day except     
 Sunday.He has been a milkman for 20   
 years.He gets up at 4,30a.m. every    
 day,goes to the dairy,loads up his    
 milk float with 750 bottles of milk   
 and other items such as eggs,pop and  
 potatoes.His float is powered by      
 batteries which have to be charged    
 every day. He collects his money on   
 Friday nights and sometimes has       
 trouble catchimng people for their    
 money.Bert does not think there will  
 be any milkmen in 3 years time because
 supermarkets sell milk cheaper. We    
 think this is a pity because they save
 people's lives every day simply by    
 noticing any unusual signs, especially
 with old people.
