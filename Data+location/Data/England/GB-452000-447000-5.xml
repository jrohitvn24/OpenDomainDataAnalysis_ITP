		<title>05Hairstyles and Jewellery</title>
		<content> Hairstyles tend to be short and       
 straight for both men and women.Gel   
 may be used to make hair stick up and 
 people sometimes colour their hair    
 bright colours.Some people use spring 
 loaded clips called bulldog clips to  
 tie their hair back.Earrings are worn 
 mostly by women but some men wear     
 earrings too.Some people don't just   
 have one hole per ear they have two or
 three.Some people even have holes in  
 their noses!Jewellery is mainly for   
 women.Necklaces are either chains or  
 beads strung on thread.Rings are      
 circles put on the fingers.Brooches   
 are designs worked in metal,clay or   
 similar materials and they often have 
 precious stones embedded in them.They 
 are fastened to the clothes by pins.  
 Scarves have printed on them patterns 
 ranging from intriguing geometric     
 designs to horses.                    </content>
