		<title>19SCHOOLCHILDREN'S FASHION</title>
		<content> Today the childrens fashion in hair is
 bobbed,permed,streaked and layered    
 hair.                                 
 The girl's shoes at the moment tend to
 be pointed 'jelly-bean'ankle boots or 
 sandals while the boys nearly all wear
 trainers.                             
 We do not wear a uniform for School so
 the girls tend to wear summery,flowery
 tops with their skirts or they wear   
 bat-wing V backed suntops with their  
 Bermuder shorts or flying suits.      
 The boys are not as fashion-conscious 
 as the girls and they nearly all wear 
 T shirts with their shorts or         
 trousers.                             
 For Games lessons the boys hardly need
 to change at all were as the girls    
 usually wear leotards and footless    
 tights.                               
                                       
                                       </content>
