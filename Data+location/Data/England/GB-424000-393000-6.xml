		<content> At one house a retired farmworker was 
 cutting the grass outside his cottage 
 with a scythe. Scythes are still made 
 in Sheffield at the Abbeydale         
 Industrial Hamlet Museum. This        
 gentleman kept two cows, a goat, some 
 doves and some hens. He said he felt  
 lost without animals after working on 
 a farm all his life. He said he could 
 remember when turnips were grown in   
 the fields near his house.This area is
 now a coniferous plantation.He said   
 the walls of his house were nearly 1  
 metre thick and it was warm in winter 
 and cool in summer.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
