		<content> Chapel-en-le-Frith is a rural district
 linked by the A6 &amp; a railway to Buxton
 &amp; Manchester. The town(pop.7760) lies 
 south of the gritstone edge of Combs  
 Moss,but east the area rises to the   
 limestone plateau &amp; the community of  
 Dove Holes(pop 960).                  
 Chapel'th grew around the church and  
 market place and is now expanding     
 rapidly.Dove Holes is a linear village
 developed in the l9th century around  
 the quarry industry.The village of    
 Combs consists of farms,cottages &amp;    
 some new houses but is entirely rural 
 in character.                         
 Many people are still employed in farm
 ing &amp; quarry-related industries but   
 light-engineering,transport &amp; metal   
 fabrication also contribute. The major
 employer is Ferodo Ltd.,producers of  
 friction materials.
