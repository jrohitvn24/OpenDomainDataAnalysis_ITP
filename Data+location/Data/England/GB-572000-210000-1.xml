		<title>01LANDSCAPE BOREHAM NORTH</title>
		<content> The area lies to the North West of    
 Boreham Village, and includes part of 
 the hamlet of Russell Green and a     
 small part of Little Waltham.         
 Much of the land is devoted to        
 farming, but in the South East there  
 is some housing, and this is separated
 from the farmland by the A.12. trunk  
 road, which together with the railway,
 which runs parallel with the road,    
 forms one of the main communication   
 links in Essex.                       
 The A.12. contrasts with the remainder
 of the roads, which are narrow, and   
 sometimes twisting.                   
 There are two noteworthy houses New   
 Hall, and Mount Maskall, several      
 farms, a golf course, some gravel     
 pits,part of a small industrial       
 complex and a disused airfield, now   
 used by Fords to test cars.
