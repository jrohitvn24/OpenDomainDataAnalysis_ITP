		<title>17BURTON SALMON FOOD 2</title>
		<content>   A survey was taken of the midday    
 meals eaten by children during a      
 school week in summer.                
   The results show that the meals of  
 all ages of children follow a similar 
 pattern. Half the meals eaten were of 
 sandwiches,a quarter were salads and  
 the remainder were cooked meals.      
   The sandwiches were made with a     
 variety of fillings. The most common  
 filling for the sandwiches of older   
 children was cheese while the most    
 common filling for younger children's 
 sandwiches was jam.                   
   Chips provided the common base for  
 the cooked meals accompanied by baked 
 beans or peas with sausage or egg or  
 ravioli.                              
   For evening meals beans on toast was
 the most common food. There was       
 usually a pudding such as yoghurt.
