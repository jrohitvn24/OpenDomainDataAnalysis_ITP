		<content>      At 8 o'clock I get up and have a 
 cup of tea,then I have my{breakfast,  
 which is usually cornflakes.I wash my 
 face,clean my teeth and get my bag    
 ready to go to{school.}My school is   
 about a  mile and a half from our     
 house,and my mother drives my sister  
 and I there in the car.               
      At school we work on several     
 subjects;we do Maths and English in   
 the morning,and in the afternoon we do
 History, Geography, Science, and P.E. 
 amongst other things.I normally have a
 hot{school lunch,}but sometimes I have
 a packed lunch.                       
      After school finishes at 3.30,I  
 go home and have{tea,}which is a hot  
 meal like fish &amp; chips.Then I either  
 watch{T.V.}or practice my air-rifle   
 shooting on our 25 metre range.After a
 bit of studying I have a snack{supper,
 watch a bit more T.V. and go to{bed.  </content>
