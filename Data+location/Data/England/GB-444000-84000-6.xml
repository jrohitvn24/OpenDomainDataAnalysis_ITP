		<title>06"Bowcombe"-Garstons.</title>
		<content>   The original land at{Garstons}was   
 purchased in the fourteenth century   
 from the Quarr Abbey estates which    
 covered an extensive area of the      
 Island at that time. The purchaser,   
 who established a farm on the site,   
 was a John Garstons; contemporarily   
 described as a "Man of substance and  
 breeder of rabbits"! Until quite      
 recently the house at Garstons was a  
 farmhouse after which the farm was    
 named, the present house having been  
 built in 1831, and{has the unique     
{status of being geographically the    
{most central house in the Island.}    
   The house is now a private residence
 the farmer having moved his           
 headquarters to nearbye Gatcombe. The 
 present owners sold a guesthouse at   
 Shanklin to "escape from the rat-race 
 to make a dream home in the country." 
 There are Roman remains in the garden.</content>
