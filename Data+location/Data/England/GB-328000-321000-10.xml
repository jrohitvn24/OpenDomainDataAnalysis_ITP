		<content>     The 250 000 chickens produce 1.4  
 million eggs a week.  If any of these 
 are cracked they are put in a         
 centrifuge to separate the eggs from  
 the shell and are then sold to a local
 baker.                                
     The temperature is kept at a      
 constant 70 deg. F.  Should the       
 temperature rise by 1 deg. F the      
 chickens would eat an extra gram of   
 food per day.  Then the food bill     
 would rise by Â£8 000 a year.  The     
 normal food bill is Â£30 000 a week.   
     All the chicken waste drops onto  
 the conveyor-belts directly under the 
 cages.  It is then scooped up and sold
 to local farmers as fertilizer.       
     The chickens are fed on a mixture 
 of 72 different ingredients, the main 
 ones being Maize and Wheat.  They are 
 also supplied with water.
