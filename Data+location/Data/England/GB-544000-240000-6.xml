		<content> There is a wide variety of housing in 
 this area.  About 50% of the popula-  
 tion were born in immediate locality. 
 Delapidated farm cottages are being   
 purchased by people outside the area  
 to modernise and extend - popular as  
 communications and employment are     
 good.  These included a row of flint  
 semi-detached cottages, 3 brick       
 terraces and 2 thatched timber-framed 
 cottages.  About 30% of population    
 live in Local Authority semi-detached 
 houses or bungalows in Crawley End,   
 Chrishall.  Some locals have taken the
 opportunity of buying their own Local 
 Authority houses.  With strict plann- 
 ing controls only 2 houses have been  
 built within the last 10 years.  Three
 large farmhouses are still the centre 
 of a farm living - one is not.
