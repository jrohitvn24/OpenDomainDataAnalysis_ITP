		<title>04Old Buildings, New Uses</title>
		<content>    There are many firms in{Malmesbury 
 which have moved into old industrial  
 buildings. One such firm is{Print     
{Aids,}which buys and sells inks and   
 chemicals to printers, and supplies   
 films for photographs. The building   
 used to be a vetinary office, and     
 before that, a coal yard. Print Aids  
 would prefer to move into a newer     
 building, as there are too many rooms 
 and they would prefer just one big one
 with all the machinery in that room.  
    The{George Hotel}in the High Street
 has been a vetinary surgery since     
 1979. It used to be a coaching        
 inn. They have found broken crockery  
 and clay pipes in the grounds.{A ghost
 is meant to haunt the building, but   
 the staff have not seen it (yet!).
