 The peas that farmers grow are pea    
 Onwards. These peas are grown and sold
 as garden peas. The bit that holds the
 pea in the pod is very small. Some    
 peas are tinned and sold in shops.    
 Some pea pods grow longer than others 
 and also longer straws. One pea is    
 grown and rhe pod can be eaten as     
 well. Another pea is grown and when   
 ready is reaped and left to dry. Then 
 they are harvested and used as        
 processed peas and mushy peas. The pea
 family is called legumes.
