		<content>{GLENN'S DAY}I woke up at 7:15 and     
 listened to the radio.I went into the 
 bathroom and had a wash then I went   
 downstairs and had my breakfast,we had
 cornflakes for breakfast. I played on 
 my computer.When it was time for      
 school I cleaned my teeth,got my coat 
 on and went on my way.As soon as I got
 to school I played football on the    
 playground until it was time to go in.
 I went into the cloak_room and changed
 my shoes,then went into our classroom 
 where I read for 10 minutes then I got
 on with my project work.My teacher    
 called the register,then allowed me to
 get on with some work.At 10:10 we had 
 assembly until 10:30.At 10:30 we had

 inside and played chess.After playtime
 we had maths until dinnertime.At
