		<content> Due to the closure of the old Coal    
 Mines, there is much derelict land    
 around some of which has been         
 reclaimed for a small industrial      
 estate at Stella Gill. Very few new   
 industries have come to the area to   
 replace the old and most people travel
 out of the area to work. There are two
 disused mineral lines in this area,   
 one has been pulled up, the other,    
 which goes to Consett has only        
 recently become disused. As industry  
 has changed, so have the local shops. 
 The Post Office is still here, but the
 Grocer, the Ironmonger and a Fish and 
 Chip shop have all been knocked down. 
 Many people felt that their area was  
 becoming run down and in need of      
 improvement. Most people thought that 
 this area has nothing to offer the    
 tourist apart from the Church which is
 143 years old.                        </content>
