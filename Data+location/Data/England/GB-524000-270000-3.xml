		<title>03The Cromwell Museum</title>
		<content> From 1160_1547 the museum was part of 
 the St John the Baptists hospital it  
 was never disolved and in 1565  became
 the town grammar school.It remained so
 until the second world war. One of the
 pupils was Oliver Cromwell. In 1962 it
 became a museum and traces the history
 of the Cromwell family and the civil  
 war.                                  
      There is a fine collection of    
 family portraits and other paintings  
 and prints give us detail of events,  
 places and things.                    
   The three albums in the museum      
 describe the major happenings of      
 the civil                             
 war including  a desciption of the    
 kings trial. The case also represents 
 items associated with the Cromwell    
 family and the civil war.The life size
 model of a Pikeman and a Musketeer are
 well worth the visit alone.           </content>
