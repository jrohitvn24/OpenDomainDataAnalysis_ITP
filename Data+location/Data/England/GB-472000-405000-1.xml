		<title>01West Carr &amp; Sandtoft</title>
		<content> The 'West Carr' area lies immediately 
 west of the village of Belton.  It is 
 a very flat extensive area of arable  
 farmland, the only residents being    
 those in isolated farmsteads.  The    
 flat nature of the land and the       
 characteristic profusion of drianage  
 ditches is attributable to its        
 reclamation from marchland by the     
 Dutch engineer Vermuyden in the early 
 17th century.  Two notable features of
 this relatively uniform area are      
 1)  Lindholme lake ( a thriving       
     privately owned trout fishery)    
 2)  Sandtoft Aerodrome (an ex-World   
     War 2 Bomber training base which  
     is now the home of Sandtoft Air   
     Services Ltd., a small private    
     firm who carry out aircraft repair
     work and offer flying lessons as  
     part of their service.
