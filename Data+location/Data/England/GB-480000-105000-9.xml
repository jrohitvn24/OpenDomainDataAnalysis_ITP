		<content>  The original school was constructed  
 in{1874}as a Board School, serving    
 mainly the children of{'land}workers'.
 Many children walked several miles to 
 attend school.                        
  During the{second world war}evacuees 
 from{LONDON}and{PORTSMOUTH}attended   
 the school raising the school roll to 
 over two hundred.                     
  The building of a new housing estate 
 at West Ashling increased dramatically
 the school roll and in {1970 a new    
{school}was constructed.               
 The Old School continued to house the 
 infants and not until{1984}was the new
 school {extended}and all pupils were  
 taught together.                      
  The{present Funtington School}has 70 
 pupils on roll.  The{old school}sadly,
 has been sold and is to be transformed
 into 4 private dwellings.
