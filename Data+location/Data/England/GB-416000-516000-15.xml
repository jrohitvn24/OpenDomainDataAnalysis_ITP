{St. Mary's (C.of E.) church}is the    
 oldest building in Gainford. It was   
 built in the 13th century by the      
{Normans.}The church is on the edge of 
 the village green at the S.W. corner. 
{St. Mary's}is the mother church for a 
 large parish, originally including    
 Piercebridge. The parish church was   
 the only place of worship in the      
 village until 1834 when the{Wesleyan  
{Chapel}was built. A{Congregational    
{church}was founded in 1847, followed  
 by a Roman Catholic church in 1854.   
 Today there are three active and      
 flourishing churches in Gainford,{St. 
{Mary's, St. Osmund's R.C.}and the     
{Wesleyan chapel.}The{Congregational   
 church is now used as a house. There  
 is a Sunday school at the Chapel. Rev.
 Lee-Warner, visits the primary school 
 weekly to preach to the children.     </content>
