		<title>11Swallownest Youth Club</title>
		<content> The Youth Club started in September   
 l984 and is appreciated by the young  
 people of Aston and Swallownest.  They
 have refreshments, music, snooker and 
 other games. It is well attended and a
 regular meeting place for children    
 from the ages of 9 to 16.  40 to 60   
 people attend the Youth Club every    
 week. They can play card games and    
 dance. Once every month the Youth Club
 holds a disco.  If you are a regular  
 attender you may have the chance to go
 on a Youth Club trip.  You may go to  
 different places like Alton Towers and
 Lightwater Valley.  All of them cost  
 money, but they are good fun.  A youth
 club only takes up one night and is   
 great fun.  There is also a bar with  
 refreshments like crisps, drinks and  
 one-penny sweets.  We hope that the   
 Youth Club will continue in years to  
 come.                                 </content>
