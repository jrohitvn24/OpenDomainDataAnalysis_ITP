		<content> Schoolwork is different in different  
 schools. I interviewed Sarah Elkins   
 who used to go to Pinhoe Middle school
 and she says it was very different .  
 She used to do scripture and copy     
 writing off of the board . In P.E she 
 had to listen to a tape and do what it
 said. In assembley instead of a       
 teacher telling them a story she had  
 to listen to a tape with stories on.  
  {OUR SCHOOLWORK DIVIDED INTO         
{    PERCENTAGE  TERMS      }          
 Maths =33\% English =25% Assembley=8\%
 Art   =4%   P.E    =8\%  Drama =21%   
   {DESCRIPTION OF OUR CLASSROOM       
 We have tables and chairs to work on, 
 two libary sections in a corner and   
 work on the walls.The teacher's desk  
 is in the middle of one wall with a   
 blackboard behind it.
