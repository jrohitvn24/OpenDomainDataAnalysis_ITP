		<title>15Recreation in rural Sowerby</title>
		<content>    Recreation is mainly "do it        
 yourself" rather than organised       
 commercial entertainment.             
    A pond has been enlarged,          
 camouflaged with conifers, broad      
 leaved trees and reeds. The farmer    
 encourages ducks to use it so that he 
 can go duck shooting. A copse of elms 
 has a large rookery and the farmer    
 again shoots the birds.               
    Fishing in the Cod Beck running    
 through the area is popular with      
 locals as well as visitors.           
    One farmer's wife schools and      
 breeds horses. Horse riding is a      
 popular pastime, and anyone wishing to
 go fox hunting may join the local     
 hunt.                                 
    Several of the ladies belong to the
 neighbouring Women's Institutes.      
 Several attend classes at local       
 Further Education Centres.            </content>
