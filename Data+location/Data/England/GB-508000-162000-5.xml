 When we asked what services the       
 village should provide several people 
 mentioned a laundrette, but they said 
 it was really better to go outside the
 village for everything else. some     
 residents felt their homes were a bit 
 small, but very few had any           
 complaints. One lady said she wanted a
 swimming pool and a roller disco, but 
 we knew she was only teasing us. What 
 people liked best about was that it   
 was private and peaceful, with lovely 
 grounds to walk in.                   
 They often had pets:- dogs,           
 budgerigars,tortoises etc. But cats   
 were not allowed.
