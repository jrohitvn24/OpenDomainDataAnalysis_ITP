		<title>16POLLUTION IN THE COUNTRYSIDE</title>
		<content> The area along the valley bottom,and  
 particulary the river Don is          
 suffering from pollution, mainly from 
 the works higher up the river.Often   
 the water is coloured with dyes from  
 the paper works.Water samples taken in
                                       
 this area show pollution.The area west
 of the Don is rich in flora and fauna,
 bats nest in large colonies in the new
 houses and near the river.Footpaths   
 are well sign posted and maintained.  
 Conservation  work has been undertaken
 along the Coumes Brook which supports 
 brown trout and fresh water shrimp.   
 Badger,fox,heron and sparrowhawk are  
 just a few of the species found here.
