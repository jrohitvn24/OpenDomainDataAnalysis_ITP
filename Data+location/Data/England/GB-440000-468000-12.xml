		<title>12MY DAY BY PAUL.</title>
		<content>    My dad keeps one of the pubs.      
 Today I got up at 8 o' clock for a    
 breakfast of jam, toast and tea.   I  
 took Brandy (the dog) down the lane   
 and biked to school at 8.30.   At     
 school I played, Blocky (running,     
 hiding, when seen running to a post   
 shouting blocky 1,2,3 and the name of 
 the person seen).   Assembly was at   
 9.30 then maths.   We played tig      
 (chasing) during first playtime       
 10.40-11.   We read till dinner.   I  
 had school dinner, beef burgers,      
 vegetables, chocolate pie and custard.
 Outside we played leapfrog.   From 1  
 o'clock we did art.   I was sent in   
 from afternoon playtime for dragging  
 Stephen across the field.  Finished   
 school at 3.30 before going to bed at 
 9.43pm I watched TV, had three        
 snacks,played on my bike and went to  
 the River Swale.   P. Whiteman.       </content>
