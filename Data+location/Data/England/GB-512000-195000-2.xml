		<content> The area surveyed lies within the     
 original Domesday Manors of Bissei    
 (Bushey) and Aldenham.  St.James's    
 church, built in the Early English    
 style, was founded in 1006 AD. There  
 is evidence of a 15th Century manor   
 house at Bushey Hall Farm. In the 19th
 Century Bushey developed a tradition  
 of painting centered around Sir Hubert
 Herkomer and Lucy Kemp-Welch.         
      More recently industrial and     
 transport developments have affected  
 the area.  In the late 1950's 2       
 industrial parks were opened in square
 05130197 which led to an enormous     
 development of housing. In the 1960's 
 the M1 motorway was carved through the
 survey area facilitating quick travel 
 into London and producing high        
 property prices.
