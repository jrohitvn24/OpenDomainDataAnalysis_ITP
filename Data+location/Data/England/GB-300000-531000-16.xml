		<content> In our class we have our own favorite 
 books but the favourite is the B.F.G. 
 which stands for the Big friendly     
 giant.It is a very good book with     
 funny parts in it. One day the B.F.G. 
 ate this peculiar green thing called a
 snozcumber and took a bite of it and  
 spit it back out because he didnt like
 it. The writer was Roald Dahl he      
 writes hundreads of books. There are  
 other writers like Enid Blyton she    
 wrote all the famous five books and   
 other fourite books. The order of the 
 best author in first place Roald Dahl 
 in second place C.S. Lewis in third   
 place Pat Hutchins.
