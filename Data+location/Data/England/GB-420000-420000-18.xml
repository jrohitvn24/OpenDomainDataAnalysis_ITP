		<title>18DEWSBURY FIRE STATION</title>
		<content> The present station was built at      
 Scouthill in 1964. It has a staff of {
{72 firemen}split up into two shifts _ 
 the day shift from 9.00am until       
 6.00pm, and the evening shift from    
 6.00pm until 9.00am. There are{4 fire 
{engines}with up to 6 men manning one  
 engine.                               
 Nowadays, a fireman's duty is more    
 than just fighting fires. There is{   
{constant drill}with all equipment,    
 security fire checks in various local 
 buildings, water supply checks and map
 making. This reflects the view that   
 the fire brigade has a much wider     
 public role to play today as an       
 emergency service. A list of{outside  
{calls for 1984}substantiates this:-{  
{Fires:}large 58; small 197; grass 83; 
 chimney 11.{Special Service Calls:}50.
{False Alarms:}genuine 158; hoax 104.  
{Calls into other localities:}192.     </content>
