		<title>09AN ARABLE FARM</title>
		<content> The farmer has lived on this farm for 
 45 years. He took it over from his    
 father in 1969. Winter corn, sown in  
 autumn, is the main crop. Bad weather 
 delayed this year's corn harvest.     
 Use of chemicals and the varieties of 
 corn grown ensure a heavy yield. Farm 
 work is mechanised as far as possible 
 for efficiency. Crops are chosen to   
 accommodate the land and to allow for 
 damage caused by deer and rabbits.    
  A typical day begins at 7.45. Break- 
 fast is followed by telephone calls,  
 planning the day's work (depending on 
 the weather), and opening mail. Meals 
 are taken at variable times when a job
 is finished. Work continues throughout
 daylight hours.                       
  The size of the farm house and farm  
 buildings enable the farmer to indulge
 his boyhood interest in steam engines,
 both model and full size.             </content>
