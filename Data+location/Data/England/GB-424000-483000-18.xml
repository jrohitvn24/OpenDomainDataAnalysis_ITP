		<content>     One senior citizen who has lived  
 in Snape for 64 years, told us about  
 her day.She gets up at 8 a.m. For     
 breakfast she has a cup of tea. In the
 morning she does housework.For lunch  
 she has meat and vegetables.In the    
 afternoon she knits, sews and does    
 various odd jobs. In the evening she  
 goes to whist or domino drives or     
 watches television. She goes to bed   
 between 10 p.m. and 10.30 p.m. She    
 likes living in Snape because it is a 
 quiet, friendly village. She does her 
 shopping in Bedale. If she needs to   
 get out of the village, she travels by
 bus or car. Her interests and hobbies 
 are knitting and sewing.
