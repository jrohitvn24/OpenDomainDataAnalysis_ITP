		<content> This is a true 'upland grassland'     
 area, despite its proximity to the    
 coast, which ccan be attributed to    
 comparatively high elevation and      
 consequently increased precipitation. 
 The western section is formed by the  
 perimeter of a gently rolling plateau,
 comprising of grass moorland          
 vegetation, which is poorly drained   
 with peaty soils. To the east the area
 is more undulating, again mainly grass
 moorland, but with coniferous forest  
 on the higher slopes and some fringe  
 areas of enclosed rough grazing. It is
 a geographically isolated area, the   
 land only being used as upland rough  
 grazing and increasingly forestry.    
 there are no 'services' as such and   
 only one minor road cuts across the   
 area which id nethertheless an        
 important access route for forestry   
 development.                          </content>
