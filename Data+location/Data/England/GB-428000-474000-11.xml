 models of the cow,the pig,and the hen 
 that stand at the entrance to Light   
 Water Valley farm.This is both a farm 
 and an amusement park.                
    During the summer you can picK     
 strawberries,raspberries and other    
 soft fruit.You can also visit the     
 piggery a very modern and amusing lay 
 out where the public can see their    
 birth and early stages of growth      
 Another farming feature is the        
 chicken breeding section ,where eggs  
 can be watched as they hatch.Robert   
 Staveley,the owner, opened his farm as
 an amusement park about 10 years ago. 
 The manager,David Ward was employed   
 initially to create a golf course.This
 was so succesful that, seven years    
 ago he was offered the post of        
 manager.It costs Â£2.95 per person to  
 go in.                                </content>
