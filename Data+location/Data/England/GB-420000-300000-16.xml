		<title>16    Transport B5000</title>
		<content> The B5000 runs from Tamworth to       
Polesworth. It starts as a single and  
changes to a dual carriageway outside  
our school. There are not many         
pavements on the B5000,there are grass 
verges instead. In the winter the      
grass gets muddy and people have to    
walk on the road and that is dangerous 
as they might get killed. Underpasses  
on the B5000 are full of graffiti and  
they smell. There are 4 roundabouts on 
the B5000. There is an Industrial      
Estate nearby which makes the road     
very busy. 380 cars drive past every   
half hour,also 60 vans,30 lorries,20   
motor bikes and 5 bicycles. 280 car    
drivers were male and 100 female. The  
most common lorry load was gravel      
going to help build the nearby M42.    
The most commn registration letter was 
'B'which is this years registration    
letter.                                </content>
