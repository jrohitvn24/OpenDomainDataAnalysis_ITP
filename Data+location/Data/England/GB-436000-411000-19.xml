		<title>19Royston Junior Mixed School</title>
		<content>   Our school is the oldest in Royston.
 Up to 1955 the school was two separate
 boys and girls schools and an infant  
 school in the same buildings. The     
 present Junior Mixed School was formed
 in 1968.                              
   In July 1986  Royston Junior School 
 wll close because of many problems.   
 The school is 89 years old (1896).    
 Empty classrooms are not being used.  
 The number of children is getting less
     1968   414 children   13 staff    
     1985   217    "        9   "      
 Sep. "     193    "        8   "      
   The cost of heating and repairing   
 the building is very high.            
   In Sept 1986 the children will move 
 to a new Royston Junior &amp; Infant      
 School being built at Summer Lane or  
 to a J &amp; I school at the present      
 Royston Infants School.
