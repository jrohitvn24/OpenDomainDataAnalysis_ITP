		<title>17The school, Hilmarton</title>
		<content> The school was built in 1851 and we   
 still use the original building today.
 The school consists of three          
 classrooms and there are 69 children, 
 aged between four and eleven,         
 attending at the moment. Many of these
 children travel to school by coach    
 from the nearby settlements.          
 There is a headmaster, two full-time  
 and one part_time teachers. There is  
 also a secretary, caretaker, welfare  
 assistant and two lunchtime           
 supervisors. The school has a         
 staffroom which is also used as an    
 office for the secretary and          
 headmaster. The school has no hall so 
 therefore we use the church hall for  
 P.E, plays and parties. We have two   
 playgrounds and two playing fields.   
 The school has no kitchen and so      
 school meals are transported from     
 the kitchen at Dunstan School, Calne. </content>
