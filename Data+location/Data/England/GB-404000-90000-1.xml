		<content> Our block covers parts of Parkstone,  
 Branksome and Westbourne.Though it is 
 covered mainly by houses open spaces  
 such as parks and the sea are to be   
 found. Most shops are situated on the 
 main roads that run through the block.
 Several schools serve the local       
 community. The two schools which have 
 participated in this survey are Sylvan
 First School and St. Joseph's Combined
 Roman Catholic School.
