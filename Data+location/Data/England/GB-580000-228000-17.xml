		<content> The house I live in belongs to my     
 parents. They have bought it so it is 
 privately owned. It is about 15 years 
 old. It is semi detached and is built 
 of bricks with tiles on the roof. A   
 couple of years ago we put an         
 extension on it. We knocked a hole in 
 the garage wall and then built a new  
 garage. My house has a small garden.  
 There are three bedrooms. My mum and  
 dad have the smallest, my sister and I
 have the middle size bedroom and my   
 two brothers have the biggest. I live 
 at 21,Knowles Close which is near the 
 park. We have central heating and we  
 cook by gas. We have a bathroom and a 
 toilet. There is a garden at the back 
 and one at the front too.
