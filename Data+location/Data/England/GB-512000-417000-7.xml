 Outside the school is a playing       
 field.At the back of the field is an  
 air raid shelter. It was used in the  
 war so you could hide away from the   
 bombs.                                
     Some of the lessons we do are     
 Mathematics, English, Spelling, Local 
 Studies, Geography, History, Physical 
 Education, Art and Games. My favourite
 subject is Art. Emma likes Maths.     
     The Maths book we use most is     
 called the Scottish Primary Maths     
 Group book, or S.P.M.G. for short. We 
 also have Mental Maths and sometimes  
 we do practical Maths.                
     We do Science as well. Sometimes  
 we do experiments with magnets or     
 rubber bands and things. I like       
 Science.
