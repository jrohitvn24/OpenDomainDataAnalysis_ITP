		<content> This predominantly rural area of the  
 Sussex Weald, consists mainly of dairy
 farmland and deciduous woodland, about
 half belonging to the Heaselands      
 Estate.  Just within this area,       
 housing development is proceding on   
 the northern outskirts of burges Hill 
 otherwise the land is sparsely        
 populated.  Scattered farms and       
 private residences adjoin the four    
 minor highways of Cuckfield Road,     
 Bishopstone Lane, and the B.2036 and  
 B.2028 which divide the area from     
 north to south.  small lakes, ponds   
 and streams abound in the region and  
 these, together with a well-maintained
 network of public footpaths and       
 bridleways, permit fishing, riding and
 walking to be enjoyed by residents of 
 the adjacent towns of burgess,        
 cuckfield, and Haywards Heath.
