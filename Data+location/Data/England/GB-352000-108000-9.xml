		<title>09Pendomer and Halstock: Roads</title>
		<content> There are few roads and most of those 
 that do exist are narrow and winding. 
 None is classified; only one, the bus 
 route from Yeovil to Halstock along   
 the west side of the reservoir, is    
 wide enough for two vehicles side by  
 side throughout its length.           
 Pendomer is approached by a road from 
 East Coker and Hardington Mandeville, 
 to the north-east. To get from        
 Pendomer to Halstock one can go up    
 this road and turn right following a  
 steep, winding road which reaches     
 Halstock via the church and school.   
 There is a link road from it to the   
 bus route. A road crosses the         
 south-east corner of the block en     
 route from Halstock to Closworth, and 
 there are two other short lengths of  
 minor road, one in the north-east and 
 one from the school southward towards 
 Halstock Leigh.                       </content>
