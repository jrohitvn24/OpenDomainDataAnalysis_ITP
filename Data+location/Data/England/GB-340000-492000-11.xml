		<content> There are approximately 30 houses with
 permanent residents in Winster, but   
 very few children. Some people are    
 over 80, but on the whole, live with  
 their relatives. In the area persists,
 and are noted on the war memorial and 
 on the gravestones and memorial       
 tablets in the church. Many of these  
 are lakeland names, dervied from the  
 Scandinavian or earlier settlers, for 
 example, Postlethwaite has 'thwaite' -
 clearing in the forest etc. It should 
 be noted that the retired "off-comers"
 bring the extra interests to the      
 locals, this is evident from the      
 village gall noticeboard, which       
 advertises so many types of meeting,  
 Historical Society, bingo, Gardeners  
 Club, Red Cross, and others, as well  
 as coffee mornings and fetes.
