		<content> Much of the area is unfenced moorland 
 with rough grazing,bracken and gorse  
 amongst the clitter of boulders and   
 with a small amount of heather and    
 whortleberry on the higher ground.    
 There are also extensive patches of   
 blanket bog.                          
 Trees are sparce,mainly hawthorn      
 associated with field boundaries and  
 in one derelict field.                
 In this section of the moor wild life 
 is unmolested,because ther is no      
 hunting and very little intrusion by  
 modern man.                           
 Vegetation does not grow easily on    
 china clay waste,so much of the       
 southern section of the area is       
 barren.                               
 The climate is typical of upland      
 exposed to southwest winds,which bring
 a high rainfall and frquent mists.    
 It is raw cold in winter.             </content>
