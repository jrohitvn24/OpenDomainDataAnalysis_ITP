		<content> There is a number of private sports   
 clubs to be found along the A451, the 
 Stourport Road, just outside the      
 Kidderminster boundary.               
 They were founded largely by the      
 workforces of the town's largest      
 employers.                            
 Two of them carry the name's of world 
 famous carpet manufacturers; Brinton's
 and Tomkinson's.                      
 The clubs have a variety of sporting  
 facilities such as squash, tennis,    
 crown green bowling, cricket, soccer  
 and rugby union.
