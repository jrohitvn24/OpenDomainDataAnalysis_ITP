		<content>{ Heddon Oak }was 408 years old when   
 one Sunday some men cut it down       
 saying that it was rotten but when it 
 was done there was nothing wrong with 
 it,                                   
                                       
   Legend has that six{West Somerset}  
 men who were {The Duke of Monmouths   
{men}and fugitives from the battle at  
 Sedgemoor were hanged at {Heddon Oak. 
{After hanging}they were tarred and    
 quartered  in the field above {Heddon 
{Oak,}this  is known as {Blood Field.  
{                                      
{   Heddon Oak}has an uncanny          
 reputation. It is said that chains can
 be heard clinking and then sounds of  
 horses being galloped nearer  but no  
 horses ever arrive.
