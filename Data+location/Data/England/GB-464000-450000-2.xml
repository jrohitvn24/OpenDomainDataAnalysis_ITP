		<content>  The{A166}goes from York to Brid. The 
 A1079 to Hull carries heavey frieght  
 traffic.Some of this traffic has to   
 pass through York but the rest goes   
 North to Scarborough or South to Leeds
 on the A64 York by-pass which was     
 opened in 1975 and has relieved York  
 of much of its congestion.It passes   
 underneath the Grimston roundabout.   
  In 1913 the{Derwent Valley Light     
{Railway}opened a 16 mile track.At both
 ends it connected with the North      
 Eastern main line.As agricultural     
 traffic switched to road transport    
 several firms established factories   
 along side the line.These are the back
 bone of industry in this area now.The 
 railway closed down in 1981.          
  The{postman}makes two deliveries a   
 day in Murton using a van ,and once a 
 day, by bike,in Dunnington where there
 is a Post Office.                     </content>
