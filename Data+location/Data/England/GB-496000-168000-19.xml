		<content> We found out about reading we read    
 more at home than at school.About     
 70% of the children said they read    
 once a day. Quite a lot of us belong  
 to a library either Egham,Staines or  
 Chertsey. Some children have quite a  
 lot of books and a girl has got over  
 500 books. Most children in the 1st   
 and 3rd year classes prefer Enid      
 Blyton and would rather read fiction  
 than non_fiction. A lot of children   
 chose to read cartoons and annuals    
 like Beano and Dandy. Some boys said  
 they'd rather read the newspaper.when 
 asked:"how would you spend a WH       
 Smith's voucher ?"many answered they  
 would rather buy something else than a
 book.Roald Dahl's book's are          
 favourites such as the BFG,George and 
 his marvellous medicine and Charlie   
 and the chocolate factory.
