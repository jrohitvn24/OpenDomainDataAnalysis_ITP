		<title>19Changing Village Life</title>
		<content>    Some older inhabitants deplore the 
 lack of amenities in their village.   
 The shop and Post Office closed 8     
 years ago and in recent years the bus 
 services have been greatly curtailed. 
                                       
    Prices of houses are high, and     
 fewer available for renting, so that  
 young people wishing to marry have to 
 move away from the area. Mechanisation
 on the farms means that there is less 
 employment available for them near    
 their homes.                          
                                       
    There is no village Pub or Inn     
 where people can meet socially. Only  
 the churches and the village hall     
 provide meeting places. The imminent  
 closure of the village school was     
 contested by the community, but now   
 seems to be inevitable.
