		<content>  We asked can we go to the church by  
 the road.Mrs Morris said we can go    
 through her garden. When we came to   
 the church we wrote some of people who
 had died in{Little Barford.}Also of   
 the people who died fighting in the   
 first world war.These are a list of   
 names; H Alington, G W Brace, A V     
 Brace, F W Brace , F H Brown.T A      
 Royds and  W L J Sawyer.Then we had a 
 look at some other graves these are   
 most of the names on the graves Mary  
 Brace, Joseph Brace, Samuel Peacock,  
 Henry Gray, Mary Gray, Annie Peacock  
 and Maria Reid.The church had been    
 closed for five or six years.After    
 looking at the church we had our      
 break.By the road there were some cows
 and their calves.When we came back    
 from the church we saw Mrs Morris     
 again.
