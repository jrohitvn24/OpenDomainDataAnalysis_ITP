		<title>14CHURCH LIFE IN SHROTON</title>
		<content>  THE RECTOR TAKES ALL THE SERVICES AND
 DRIVES TO SHROTON FROM IWERNE MINSTER 
 WHERE HE LIVES. SOMETIMES HE COMES TO 
 CHAT WITH PEOPLE TO TELL THEM ABOUT   
 THE CHURCH. THERE ARE USUALLY QUITE A 
 FEW PEOPLE AT THE SERVICES BUT NOT    
 ENOUGH TO FILL THE CHURCH COMPLETELY. 
 THE FAMILY SERVICE IS POPULAR. WE SING
 ABOUT 4 HYMNS AND SAY A FEW PRAYERS.  
 THEN A HELPER TELLS A STORY TO ALL OF 
 THE YOUNGER CHILDREN THAT HAS         
 SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE BIBLE. AFTER 
 THAT ALL THE YOUNG CHILDREN GO TO THE 
 CRECHE. IN OUR LAST HYMN WE HAVE A    
 COLLECTION OF MONEY AND THE TREASURER 
 CHOOSES TWO OLDER CHILDREN TO DO IT.  
 THEN THE RECTOR TELLS US ABOUT THE    
 OTHER SERVICES DURING THE WEEK. THE   
 CHRISTMAS SERVICE IS ALMOST THE SAME  
 BUT ALL THE CHILDREN LIGHT CANDLES TO 
 PUT ROUND THE CRIB. WE HAVE ONE       
 SERVICE A WEEK USUALLY.               </content>
