		<content> **************************************
 The Peregrine falcons are a protected 
 species.We are very lucky to have them
 nesting in our Domesday Block at      
 Symonds Yat rock grid reference{56/13.
   Symonds Yat is a{S.S.S.I.}({Sight of
{Special Scientific Interest})         
 In the Summer of{1984}roughly{45,000} 
 people came to see them in this area  
 of outstanding natural beauty.The{RSPB
 have taken interest in the birds.They 
 have a warden to watch the falcons.   
 They have laid three eggs. Two eggs   
 were hatched, but subsequently died   
 in the cold weather of early spring   
 1985.The third egg is infertile and   
 will never hatch despite the fact     
 that the parent birds are still       
 trying to incubate it.
