Most people thought transport was the  
worst local problem.The  Government    
came second which includes reparing bad
roads, drainage and pollution. A few   
people thought that unemployment and   
visitors were problems. Unemployment   
was the biggest concern for Britain    
followed by war with things like       
nuclear bombs. Some people thought     
that drugs and over population were    
problems.    Starvation   was by far   
the biggest concern worldwide.         
Violence and terrorism came next. A    
few people though that war and over    
population were worries.               
   Burglaries were the only crime      
problem for Oulton Broad. Most people  
thought that newcomers fitted in well. 
Fish is  the most popular local food. A
third crossing over the river has      
caught people's attention.             </content>
