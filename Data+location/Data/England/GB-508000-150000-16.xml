		<title>16E.Horsley S. Nomad Players</title>
		<content> In 1984 the Nomad Players celebrated  
 their 50th birthday.  Originally they 
 had no permanent venue for their pro- 
 ductions, hence the name 'Nomads'.  In
 December 1956, a theatre conversion   
 began on a building in E.Horsley which
 had previously been a carriage shed &amp; 
 a milking parlour on the Lovelace Est-
 ate.  By April 1957, after dedicated  
 hard work from members the first pro- 
 duction was staged there.  Although   
 all amateurs, the Players are renowned
 for their high standards &amp; profession-
 al attention to detail. Over the years
 there have been more than 120 produc- 
 tions, as well as revues &amp; cabarets.  
 Running an amateur theatre is costly, 
 Â£2,000 being needed annually for main-
 tenance alone.  Finance is provided by
 annual subscriptions, fund-raising    
 events, a Draw Club and a bar for mem-
 bers.  It is now a registered Charity.</content>
