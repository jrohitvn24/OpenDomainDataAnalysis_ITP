		<title>16SHOPS IN WISBOROUGH GREEN</title>
		<content> In Wisborough Green there is a small  
 supermarket called Eversheds. You can 
 buy drinks, chocolate and icecream.   
 You can buy bread and things in tin   
 cans. You can buy yoghurt, butter,    
 margarine, cakes and things you can   
 write with. You choose the things you 
 want to buy and take them to the lady 
 at the cash till to pay for them.     
 If you go to the green grocers called 
 Panda you ask for the fruit and       
 vegetables that you buy. They are     
 weighed and then you pay for them.    
 At the butchers called Kevin Haycock's
 you ask for the meat you want and wait
 to be served.                         
 There is also a hairdressers shop     
 where children and ladies have their  
 hair done.                            
 The other two shops sell antiques,    
 selling old furniture,glass and china.
