		<title>10ABBEYFORD WOOD</title>
		<content>  {Abbeyford Wood}is a wood in         
 Brightley.                            
 It is owned by the{Forestry Commission
 and the local people use it for       
 picnics,walking and picking           
 blackberries.                         
   In Abbeyford Wood the trees you get 
 there are scots pine,norway spruce,   
 ash even holly and hazel.             
 The trees are mostly evergreen but    
 some are deciduous. Some times the    
 trees are cut down for christmas      
 trees.                                
   There was a {wildlife park          
 about ten years ago and some  of the  
 porcupines and deer escaped into the  
 forest. After that people have seen   
 them in the wood.People are not allow-
 ed to ride bikes in the wood because  
 it would encourage people to ride     
 their motorbikes in there and that    
 would spoil the forest.               </content>
