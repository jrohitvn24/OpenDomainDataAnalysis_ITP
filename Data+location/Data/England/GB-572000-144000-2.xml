		<content> The village itself has a fine 14th    
 century church with a unique snuffer  
 tower and 16th century fort. A number 
 of general shops can supply most daily
 needs and the several pubs of all     
 classes are well patronized. As with  
 too many towns and villages in the    
 1980's there is little for modern     
 youth to occupy its time and minor    
 vandalism is common place. There is   
 however, a good community spirit and  
 Marden retains its village identity.
