		<content> The area suffers the effects of high  
 unemployment. Mnay of the big         
 employers in the area, such as        
 I.C.I.,British Steel, the shipping    
 industrries have made people          
 redundant.Many fathers now work on the
 Oil fields being at home for 2weeks   
 and away for 2 weeks.This affects home
 life.                                 
 Asurvey conducted in Thorntree showed 
 that out of a potential work force of 
 328, 163 were employed whilst 165 were
 unemployed.                           
 This is not an encouraging future for 
 children leaving school,many have to  
 leave the area for work or sign on the
 'dole'. Maybe the problems discussed  
 on the following pages are partly a   
 result of this situation.
