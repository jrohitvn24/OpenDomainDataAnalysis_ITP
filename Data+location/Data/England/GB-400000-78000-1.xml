		<title>01INTRODUCTION SWANAGE</title>
		<content>   Swanage is a seaside resort which is
 famous for its beauty. However for a  
 1000 years fishing and the stone      
 industry have provided livings for    
 many, but this has become very limited
 and is now really a novelty.          
   The town's principal industry today 
 is derived from the holiday makers    
 which increases the town's population 
 from 8,500 to 45,000 in the summer.   
   It has been estimated that Swanage  
 and the Isle of Purbeck bring in      
 Â£20million a year. The nature of the  
 resort and its surrounings makes it   
 attractive for family holidays. There 
 are educational visits, including:    
 school studies, activity holidays,    
 diving, walking, sailing, riding, golf
 and fishing, senior citizens holidays 
 and those for disabled persons. There 
 are also touring holidays linked with 
 many other places in the area.        </content>
