 Irish Tig and Last one in the Semi.   
  Irish Tig is played by a group of    
 people one of whom is'On'.Time is     
 allowed for this person to escape     
 before all the others try to catch    
 him. The person who is 'on' tries to  
 avoid capture by dodging then if he is
 caught then it is someone else's turn 
 to be 'On'.

 semi needs one person in the middle of
 the playground the others at one end.

 without being caught.If they succeed  
 then all the others run down the      
 playground,anyone caught is the person
