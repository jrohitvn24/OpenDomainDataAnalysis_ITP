		<content> COUNTRY AND MOTORWAY.                 
 The area is W-E transect which        
 includes the Cotswold escarpment. In  
 the East is the steep scarp slope, the
 Western area is part of the lowlands  
 bordering the Severn estuary.         
  Traditionally a rural area of large  
 estates and wealthy landowners the    
 farmland is now fragmented into       
 smaller landholdings, with an         
 increasing concentration on dairy     
 farming as one approaches Bristol.    
 There is no large settlement in the   
 area apart from the hamlet of         
 Codrington and no amenity except the  
 Codrington Arms.Central to the area is
 the M4 Motorway which dominates the   
 landscape when seen from the top of   
 the escarpment at the Tormarton       
 interchange. The impact of the M4 has 
 been considerable,it is a West-East   
 link, but a North-South divide.       </content>
