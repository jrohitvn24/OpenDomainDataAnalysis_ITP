		<title>15HOW SUNDAY IS SPENT (2).</title>
		<content> Then we went to Messing to interview  
 some people there.The first person we 
 interviewed in Messing told us what   
 he does on a typical Sunday;he does   
 some gardening and watches television.
 Then we asked him if he goes to Church
 but he doesn't.Then we asked him what 
 he does in his spare time. He said he 
 paints the outside of the house and he
 also enjoys gardening.The next person 
 told us she cooks lunch,sometimes     
 goes for a ride, or she goes to visit 
 somebody.Then we asked her if she goes
 to church but she doesn't very        
 often.We asked her what she does in   
 her spare time.She does gardening or  
 wall papering.The next lady we        
 interviewed was quite interesting. On 
 a Sunday she does some gardening and  
 goes for a bike ride. At lunch time   
 she goes to the pub.She told us that  
 she does not go to church.            </content>
