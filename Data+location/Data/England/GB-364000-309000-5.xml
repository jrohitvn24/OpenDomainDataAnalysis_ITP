		<title>05The Ercall Woods</title>
		<content>  The Ercall is a Woodland area which  
 is mainly oak with a few Silver Birch 
 trees.Since oak trees take a long time
 to grow Ercall Woods must have been   
 there for hundreds of years.          
  The leaves of the oak are lobed and  
 grow alternately on the stem.The fruit
 of the oak is the acorn and when they 
 fall from the tree they start to      
 germinate,but many of the young trees 
 do not survrive.The roots of the oak  
 grow out of the ground at the base of 
 the tree and are very long and        
 twisted.The woodland grass is thin and
 spikey.                               
  Foxes,squirrels,hedgehogs,owls,      
 rabbits and other animals and birds   
 live in the woods but are rather shy  
 and difficult to spot.
