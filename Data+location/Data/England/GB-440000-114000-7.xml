		<title>07SOUTHAMPTON COMMON 1</title>
		<content>     The Common is situated in the     
 centre of Southampton. It is bounded  
 to the east and west by two major     
 routes running North and South from   
 the city centre to the M27 in the     
 north.                                
     The common consists of a large    
 grassy area crossed by a network of   
 paths and dotted with small areas of  
 dense deciduous trees and bushes.     
 There are three lakes, one used for   
 model boats, and a paddling pool.     
     There are facilities for some team
 games; a playground attracts young    
 children and is used by a playgroup,  
 but the essential use is as a 'lung'  
 for the city. A number of events are  
 staged on the common. The City show,  
 lasting three days in July attracts a 
 large following. There is also a fair 
 for about four days during the spring 
 bank holiday.                         </content>
