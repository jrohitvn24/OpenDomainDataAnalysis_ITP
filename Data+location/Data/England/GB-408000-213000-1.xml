		<title>01A SUMMARY_NORTHLEACH AREA</title>
		<content>   Northleach is a small, historic     
 town, situated to the east of the     
 crossroads of the A429 Fosseway and   
 the former A40 road. It lies within   
 the Cotswold Area of Outstanding      
 Natural Beauty. The community is an   
 active one with a parish church, a    
 grammar and a primary school, a county
 museum, fire and police stations, a   
 selection of shops and many activities
 It is, however, a town in a crisis    
 because of the decline in population  
 by 7%, 1971_81 and the decline in the 
 proportion of young people. In 1985   
 Draft Proposals for the area were     
 produced_notably to allow limited     
 'family housing' development and to   
 create employment through expansion of
 tourism and small_scale industrial    
 ventures. Since the opening of the    
 bypass in 1984 such development is    
 feasible _some would say essential.   </content>
