		<content>        BISHOPSTONE AND HINTON         
 DOWNS. THE AREA CONSISTS MAINLY OF    
 FARMLAND.IT OCCUPIES A PORTION OF THE 
 MARLBOROUGH DOWNS SOUTH OF BISHOPSTONE
 AND SEVEN MILES EAST OF SWINDON,      
 WILTSHIRE,REPUTED TO BE THE FASTEST   
 GROWING TOWN IN EUROPE.               
 THE BISHOPSTONE AND HINTON DOWNS      
 REMAIN ALMOST UNTOUCHED  BY MODERN    
 DEVELOPMENT. THE ONLY SIGN OF IT IS AT
 SU 240.800 WHERE THE M.4. MOTORWAY    
 PASSES WITHIN METRES OF THE           
 BOUNDARY.THERE ARE ABOUT TWELVE HOUSES
 IN THE AREA,FOUR OF WHICH ARE         
 SCATTERED WHILST THE OTHERS CLUSTER   
 AROUND A ONCE PROSPEROUS, BUT AT      
 PRESENT  DEFUNCT, RACING              
 STABLES.UNDULATING GRASS AND ARABLE   
 LAND BETWEEN 500 AND 800 FEET ABOVE   
 SEA LEVEL,TRAVERSED BY THE ANCIENT    
 RIDGEWAY AND OTHER FOOT AND BRIDLE    
 PATHS,MAKE THIS AREA VERY ATTRACTIVE. </content>
