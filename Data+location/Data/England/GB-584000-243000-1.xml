		<title>01AROUND LONG MELFORD</title>
		<content> The River Stour winds through the     
 middle of our area. Cattle graze the  
 river meadows. The ground rises gently
 away from the river up to rolling farm
 land. The main crops are sugar beet   
 and corn. the large village of Long   
 Melford (p.3,300) lies along the A 134
 which follows the river valley. Long  
 Melford has many old houses and a     
 variety of shops including 16 antique 
 shops and taxidermists. A disused     
 railway line offers rough cycling,    
 horse riding and walks in pleasan     
 countryside. Nearby there is a picnic 
 park with a riverside nature trail and
 fishing. There is a large factory     
 outside Long Melford which processes  
 herbs and spices for food flavouring  
 essences. In the village there are    
 several busy smaller factories and    
 workshops. The countryside has a few  
 isolated farms and hardly any houses. </content>
