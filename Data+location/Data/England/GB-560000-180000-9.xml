		<content>         Under the floor of the church 
 there is the body of a man in a tomb. 
 His name was Francis Button and he    
 died on July 16th,1830.               
         There is a very old organ in  
 the church.It can be worked by pumping
 in air with a wooden hand pump.In the 
 past when people pumped the organ,    
 they used to carve their names in the 
 wood at the side of the organ.There is
 a scroll on the wall. It looks as     
 though it is made of paper but in fact
 it is made of marble.There is a big   
 bowl that looks like a barbeque.It was
 once used to keep the church warm,by  
 burning charcoal in it. There is also 
 an old oak trunk holding the churches 
 secrets. It is bolted heavily. We     
 think that St.Mary's church is a      
 useful guide to things from the past.
