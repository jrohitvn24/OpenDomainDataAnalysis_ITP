There is little commercial and social  
life in the area surveyed. Freeland has
a village hall, a wooden single-storey 
building next to the playing field in  
the village centre, and here there is a
playgroup for pre-school children, and 
some activities for old people. There  
is a light engineering factory to the  
south of Freeland and a large farm shop
selling meat and dairy products. In the
village is a convent and a private     
nursing home. The village shop is to   
the north of the village centre, just  
outside our area.                      
                                       
Tourism passes our area by, in favour  
of Woodstock to the north, Eynsham to  
the south and Witney to the west, but  
there is a small caravan site on the   
bank of the Evenlode SE of Church      
Hanborough at Goose Eye Farm GR 437121.</content>
