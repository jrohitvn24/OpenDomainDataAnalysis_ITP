		<title>15CHANGES IN GILMORTON</title>
		<content> The children interviewed a lady who   
 has lived in Gilmorton for 50         
 years.She told them that there used to
 be 500 people living in the           
 village,about 200 fewer than now.There
 used to be many more shops than there 
 are now including 2 butchers,one of   
 which was thatched,sweet shops        
 including one made of mud,a post      
 office and a bake-house.There was also
 a stocking factory which sent its     
 goods by horse and cart to            
 Leicester.Many of the houses were mud 
 and thatched.The school was where the 
 present Crown Inn is.There were two   
 classrooms and two teachers,with the  
 headmistress living behind the        
 school.A bell,which is still          
 hung,called the children to school.The
 present school was a big,dark         
 house.Most of the villagers were      
 farmers or shop-owners.               </content>
