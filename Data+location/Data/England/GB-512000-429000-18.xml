		<content> As well as the national radio network 
 run by the B.B.C. we are served by two
{local radio stations.}Radio Humberside
 and Radio Viking.                     
 They run similar sevices including    
 such items as local news, current     
 affairs, traffic news, interviews with
 local people, both famous and not so  
 famous, chat shows and copious        
 helpings of popular music.            
 The main difference between the       
 stations is that{Humberside}is state  
 run and paid for by the television    
 licence fee and{Viking}is privately   
 owwned and paid for by companies      
 advertising their products and        
 services.                             
 Both will tell you that they are best.
 Humberside used to boast the largest  
 audience of any local radio station in
 Britain till Viking began broadcasting
 about a year ago.                     </content>
