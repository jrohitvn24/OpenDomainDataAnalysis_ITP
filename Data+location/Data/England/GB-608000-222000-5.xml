		<content>    A NEW ROAD HAS BEEN BUILT TO       
 RELIEVE THE HEAVY TRAFFIC ON THE      
 SMALLER ROADS IN THIS AREA.THE ROAD IS
 THE A120.IT CUTS THROUGH THE NORTHERN 
 PART OF THE AREA,CROSSES OVER THE OLD 
 A604 (HARWICH ROAD) AND JOINS THE A133
 AT A LARGE ROUNDABOUT (GR 103235).    
    THE ROAD IS USED BY A LOT OF       
{HOLIDAY TRAFFIC,}GOING TO CLACTON,    
 WALTON AND FRINTON.THE NEW ROAD HAS   
 HAD A SERIOUS EFFECT ON PUBLIC HOUSES 
 AND GARAGES THAT GREW UP ALONG THE    
 SMALLER ROADS,RELYING ON THE TRAFFIC  
 FOR THEIR INCOME.UNFORTUNATELY,TO MAKE
 THE ROAD POSSIBLE SOME OF THE RICH    
 FARMLAND HAD TO BE DESTROYED.
