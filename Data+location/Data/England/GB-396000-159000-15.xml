		<content>    Polo needs three or more players.  
 One person is chosen to think of a    
 subject such as "birds".  The others  
 think of things connected with the    
 subject such as "robins".  The person 
 who was chosen then chooses one answer
 and calls out that word.  The person  
 chosen runs and so does whoever       
 thought of the answer.  They run up   
 and down three times.  Whoever wins   
 chooses the next subject.             
    Chain-tig needs about ten people.  
 Two people are chosen and the others  
 run.  The two that were chosen have to
 hold hands and tap one of the others. 
 When one is tapped he has to hold     
 hands with the other two. When they   
 tap another person they separate into 
 twos.  The pairs carry on tapping     
 people. When all the people have been 
 tapped they start the game again.
