		<title>11CHANGING TIMES - by BEN</title>
		<content>{ Arkengarthdale}has changed little in 
 appearance in the last{100 years.}No  
 new houses have been built and all    
 electricity cables are underground.   
 One major change is in{transport}-    
 once the only transport was horse and}
 cart. People did not go out of the    
 dale for shopping or holidays. Today  
 every family has at least one vehicle.
{ Electricity}came to the dale in the  
 1950's. Once there were several{shops,
 a cobbler and baker plus  travelling  
 shops including a banking bus. Today  
 only a general dealers shop remains in
 the village and a mobile butcher calls
{ Farming}too is changing. Many young  
 people prefer to farm the lower land  
 and a lot of people have moved from   
 the dale to find employment.          
 Previously children wore clogs,the    
 boys suits and girls pinafores.Today  
 jeans, T-shirts &amp; trainers are worn.  </content>
