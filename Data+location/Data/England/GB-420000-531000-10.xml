		<title>10LIFE-STYLE/SOCIAL CONCERNS.</title>
		<content> We have seen something of village life
 -style within the block (page 9); its 
 close neighbourly simplicity can be   
 contrasted favourably with some of the
 present day urban problems. There are,
 however, certain worries &amp; concerns in
 the communities about declining facili
 ties for religious worship, education,
 welfare. Such problems might worsen if
 there were any further cut-backs in   
 public transport. The railways gone &amp; 
 only one village bus route. E.G.:     
 RELIGION- No CofE in block. Those late
 of Binchester &amp; Newfield pulled down. 
 Sunday School has been asked for in   
 Binchester Community Centre. Only one 
 Methodist Chapel-Newfield- still open,
 others empty or put to secular use.   
 EDUCATION- Schools at Binchester and  
 Newfield now closed. Nearest juniors -
 Byers Green; secondary, B/Auckland.   
 MEDICAL-Nearest doctor, Byers Green.  </content>
