		<title>04Cattle at Ascott Home Farm.</title>
		<content>    At the farm there are 200 pedigree 
 Friesian cows and bulls. 120 cows give
 milk and the rest are heifers. A cow  
 has its first calf at 2.5 years and   
 then gives milk for about 300 days per
 year. Each cow produces about 12      
 litres of milk per day and about 3600 
 litres per year. The cows are let into
 the milking parlour 14 at a time. They
 are sprayed with water and connected  
 to the milking machines (called the   
 clusters). The milk is collected      
 separately for each cow and the amount
 is written down. When all the milk is 
 removed, the clusters are             
 automatically disconnected and the    
 farmer sprays the udders with a       
 disinfectant. Then each cow moves out 
 and the milk goes to the refrigerated 
 tank where it is stored. It is taken  
 by milk tanker each morning to a Luton
 dairy for processing and bottling.    </content>
