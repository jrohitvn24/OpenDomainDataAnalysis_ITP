		<title>01General Survey of Whitley</title>
		<content> Whitley is a rural Cheshire village   
 just 9.5 kms south of Warrington and 8
 kms from Northwich. It is just off the
 M56 and between the A49 and A559. The 
 population is around 540 people. The  
 main industry is agriculture with 20% 
 of the working population involved.All
 mains services except Gas and Sewage. 
 No shops,but mobile deliveries of milk
 fish,bread,post and papers.There is an
 Anglican Church, Methodist Chapel, a  
 Friends' Meeting House and four public
 houses. The School and Village Hall   
 play important roles in our parish and
 surroundings, e.g., through activities
 and events which bring the population 
 together.}Behind the Village hall is  
 the Scout hut and there is also a     
 Guide hut. There are many pits and    
 ponds left from earlier sand and clay 
 extraction. Whitley is a Whitebelt    
 area so new building is not allowed.  </content>
