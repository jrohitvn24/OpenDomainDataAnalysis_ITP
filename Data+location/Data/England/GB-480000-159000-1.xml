  Yateley lies in the north-east corner
 of Hampshire where this county meets  
 Berkshire and Surrey. The river       
 Blackwater separates Yateley from     
 Sandhurst and provides a boundary     
 between Hampshire and Berkshire.There 
 has been very rapid housing develop-  
 ment in the last two decades,changing 
 the character of the area from a      
 village to a small town,with an       
 estimated population of over 25,000.  
 Good communication (easy access to    
 motorways 3 and 4 and trains and      
 buses) has inevitably led to the area 
 becoming a dormitory town and a steady
 stream of traffic can be observed     
 leaving Yateley every morning in the  
 directions of London,Reading and      
 Southampton.
