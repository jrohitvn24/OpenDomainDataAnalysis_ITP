		<title>11Chatteris - Horseway People</title>
		<content> Travelling up New Road there were     
 orchards and strawberry fields.  There
 was also a fever hospital on the      
 outskirts of Chatteris for typhus and 
 other diseases.                       
                                       
 Chris Green, the son of the people who
 owned "The Farmer's Boy" was the only 
 boy to be killed during the First     
 World War, from the New Road area.    
                                       
 In 1942 during the Second World War,  
 Henry Coulson bought the farm that    
 became known as Coulson's Farm.  After
 the war the land on both sides of New 
 Road became largely used for the      
 production of cash crops.             
                                       
 In the 1950's and 1960's the council  
 built houses at Newlands and          
 Queensway.  In the 1970's a private   
 estate, Green Park, was started.      </content>
