 Kimberworth Park;Rotherham.           
  The houses have tall chimneys and    
 very long roofs. There are four       
 detached houses to make a block. On   
 the chimneys are T.V. aerials and two 
 chimney pots. The roof tiles are a    
 reddish colour. The glass in the      
 windows have lead in them. They open  
 in and out. There are two doors in the
 middle of the block and between them  
 is a passage way which leads to the   
 back garden. Underneath the windows is
 a windowsill which is painted white.  
 On the front of the block there are   
 wires on the wall.
