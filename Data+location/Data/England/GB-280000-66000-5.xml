		<title>05Elastics' games, Ipplepen.</title>
		<content>   There are{several variations}of this
 game which{came to Devon}schools 20   
 years ago. The equipment needed is a  
 loop of elastic about 5 metres long.  
{ One version}of the game is           
{Cartwheeling over the Elastic.}Three  
 people are needed, two people stand   
 inside the loop, the third person then
 cartwheels over. Their hands must go  
 down inside the elastic loop and their
 feet go over both lengths of elastic. 
 After you go over the elastic, it gets
 higher and higher, like hurdles.  The 
 game begins with the loop at ankle    
 level, after each round it is moved up
 the body.  If some-one is out she     
 swops places with a person inside the 
 elastic loop. The game doesn't really 
 end because when the loop is too high 
 to get over the game begins again.    
{ Another version}is jumping over the  
 elastic using twists and turns.       </content>
