		<title>01Area around Stoge Lacy</title>
		<content> A mainly agricultureal area, with     
 small hamlet of Stoge Lacy as the only
 centre for services. Interestingly,   
 the newer part of the hamlet has been 
 built just north of the crossroads and
 has taken the centre of activity with 
 it.                                   
                                       
 A Symonds Cider factory is here also a
 family concern of some size compared  
 to the many small Ciderworks in       
 Herefordshire as a whole.             
                                       
 Generally the area is farmland, fairly
 well cultivated with few facilities   
 and dominated by small lanes and      
 footpaths.
