		<title>08ADDERLEY CHURCH FETE</title>
		<content>  The Church Fete takes place every    
 year. They have a fancy dress for     
 children from our school. Last year a 
 helicopter landed from Tern Hill;     
 Adderley Judo Club did a display and  
 there was a pig being roasted on a    
 spit for a dance that night. This year
 the Rector has got the local Disc     
 Jockey to play 60's music at night    
 time for the mums and dads to dance   
 to. During the day there are races    
 going on with games and various       
 stalls. You can have a ride on a pony 
 and trap to the church and back. All  
 the money goes to the church. In      
 Autumn we have a Harvest Auction after
 the service where they sell the       
 vegetables and fruit that have been   
 given to the church. It is a very     
 popular occasion.
