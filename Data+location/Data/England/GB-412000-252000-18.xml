 works mainly for the Royal Shakespeare
 Company in Stratford and is           
 responsible for all their metal       
 properties.He has been a Blacksmith   
 all his life but he has never shod any
 horses.He works in steel, aluminium   
 and iron.The swords he makes for RSC  
 plays are individually made to fit the
 actor for weight etc. and cost about  
 Â£l00.It is not sharp but looks to have
 a fine edge.He attends the rehearsals 
 to ensure that all his objects are    
 satisfactory as sometimes they need   
 alteration.Besides making armour and  
 weapons he also makes scenery, moving 
 equipment e.g. bicycles and furniture.
 In the forge he uses hammer anvil and 
 pliers.The fuel used is fine coke and 
 there is a fan which blows the fire.  
 While working he often gets burned.
