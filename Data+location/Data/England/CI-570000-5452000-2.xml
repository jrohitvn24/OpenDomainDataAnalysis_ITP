		<title>02COTTAGE FARM (1)</title>
		<content>    Cottage Farm is located in St.     
 Martin. It has been rented from       
 Brigadier Lempriere-Robin, of{Rosel   
{Manor.}The area it covers is about 200
 vergees (80 acres), twice as large as 
 many Jersey farms. It is a mixed farm,
 i.e. it is for cattle and crops.      
    There are 63 milking cows, 12 cows 
 under 6 months, 6 6-12-month-old      
 calves, and 12 heifers. The record age
 for a cow is 24 years old. The average
 age of the cows on this farm is 3-4   
 years old. They are marked on their   
 ears, the colour tags tell the farmer 
 how much food to give them.           
    We looked at some calves about     
 eight weeks old, and suddenly noticed 
 the cows had no horns. They had been  
 cut off at three weeks old because    
 they could have hurt each other with  
 them.
