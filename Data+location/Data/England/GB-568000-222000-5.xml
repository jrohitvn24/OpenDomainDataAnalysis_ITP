		<title>05  BLAKE HOUSE FARM</title>
		<content>   Blake House Farm is approximately   
 600 acres. It is an arable farm,      
 growing mainly wheat, peas and rape.  
 Four people work on the farm, Mr      
 Harvey, his brother and two others.   
    They have six tractors of different
 sizes, trailers, sprayers and one     
 combine harvester. They have a drier  
 to dry the grain and some large barns 
 where it is stored until it is sold.  
   At Blake Farm they also grow crops  
 for seed which they sell to King's    
 Seeds of Coggeshall. They have a      
 contract with an agricultural chemical
 firm - they test out new sprays on    
 their crops. This helps them to keep  
 up with new technology. This year they
 are growing a new crop called Durum   
 wheat which is used for spaghetti.    
   The crops are sown in the autumn and
 harvested in August. During harvest   
 the men work very long hours.         </content>
