		<title>01Polperro village  Lansallos</title>
		<content>      The whole of the area is         
 dominated by the village and harbour  
 of Polperro. It is visited by tens of 
 thousands of tourists during the      
 summer and the whole of life is       
 governed by this influx. The harbour  
 still has a fishing industry but many 
 of the smaller boats cater for the    
 tourist trade rather than the         
 commercial markets. The majority of   
 the buildings around the village      
 centre,harbour and main streets are   
 associated with tourism,ie.,shops,    
 restaraunts and holiday               
 accommodation,and thus property prices
 are very high.The streets are closed  
 to holiday traffic during the         
 summer,but there is a large car park  
 at the entrance to the village.
