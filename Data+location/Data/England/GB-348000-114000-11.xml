		<content> It began as a small venture growing   
 potatoes in{1976}and has expanded     
 since then to apple tree,raspberries  
 and soft fruit,vegetables and salad   
 crops.We have 3 polythene tunnels and 
 use a lot of perforated mulch.The land
 was previously used as grazing for    
 horses and before that calf rearing.  
{Including our own produce}we sell a   
 wide range of imported fruit and      
 vegetables,and try to cater for the   
 up-market customers.Some vegetables   
 are directed especially at the whole  
 sales market eg.Bunched carrots,      
 calabrese,and leeks. The{annual

 but still growing. It is a family     
 business employing two or three local 
 part-time workers.The soil is a sandy 
 loam but with clay at the top which is
 left wild.          {(see also p.14)
