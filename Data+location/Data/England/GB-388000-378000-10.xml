		<content>   Adlington Hall is an historic       
 home.It has belonged to the Legh      
 family for nearly 600 years.The       
 present owner, Mr. Charles Legh, was  
 interviewed by two of our pupils{Lucy 
{Oliver and Claire Dudley}aged eleven. 
    At present the hall has four main  
 parts which were built between 1450   
 and 1757. The oldest part is the Great
 Hall where some woodrot has recently  
 been found behind the fireplace. Its  
 most unusual feature is two pillars   
 supporting the organ loft which were  
 carved from living oak trees complete 
 with roots.                           
    Visitors may look round the hall on
 the afternoons of Sunday, Wednesday,  
 and Saturday. Admission costs Â£1.40   
 for adults and 70p for children. The  
 hall opens from Easter to the end of  
 September. Seven people work at the   
 hall and its gardens.                 </content>
