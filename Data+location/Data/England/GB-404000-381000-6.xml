		<title>06Farming in Chinley</title>
		<content> Many of the small-holdings and even   
 the larger farms in Chinley are       
 finding it very difficult to break    
 even, for as Common Market (E.E.C.)   
 quotas on milk decrease, cutting the  
 size of the milking herd is sometimes 
 the only answer.                      
    Other problems arise from the hilly
 landscape, which makes it very        
 difficult, or even impossible, to     
 cultivate crops other than grass.     
    Weather is also against the        
 farmers, as frequent downpours can    
 destroy winter feed, making it        
 impossible to dry the grass and turn  
 it into hay. We certainly seem to have
 more than our fair share of wet and   
 blustery weather in the Blackbrook    
 Valley!
