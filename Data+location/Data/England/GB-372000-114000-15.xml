		<title>15BLACKMORE VALE POOR FARMLAND</title>
		<content> Roughly half 0374/0115 is the estate  
 of a Georgian mansion standing in 250 
 acres of open land.200 years old,it is
 being extensively restored.There are  
 many outbuildings,stables and barns,  
 three cottages and a detached house.  
 The land has been well landscaped with
 many fine oak ash and beech but none  
 of the pasture is used for dairy      
 cattle,only for three riding horses.  
 The other part of this area has the   
 Caundle Brook meeting the River Lydden
 and little use appears to be made of  
 the water-meadows(easily flooded).The 
 remainder of the pasture consists of  
 outlying fields of a neighbouring farm
 with a large herd of Friesians.       
 The waterways are choked with reeds,  
 rushes and debris.There are few places
 for fishing.No waterfowl but these    
 fields abound with foxes,badgers and  
 rabbits.There are few butterflies.    </content>
