		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content> The area lies high in the Brendon     
 Hills to the north west of the small  
 town of Wiveliscombe. Most of the land
 is above 300m and consists of rough   
 grazing with some clumps of trees. The
 northern end of Wimbleball reservoir  
 reaches into the south-western corner 
 of the block.                         
 The farmland is used primarily for    
 sheep with just a few cattle and the  
 occasional field of barley or oats    
 which will be later used to feed the  
 livestock.                            
 The fields are lined with thick hedges
 and some are ploughed in spring and   
 early summer to be resown to improve  
 the grazing. Most of the fields will  
 eventually be treated in this way     
 every five to ten years.              
 It is an area of great natural beauty 
 with sparse population.
