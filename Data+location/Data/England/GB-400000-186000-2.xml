		<content>    Recreational activities are rural  
 pastimes of hunting, shooting, walking
 and cycling.                          
    Fox Hunting is not very good in    
 this area because of the dense        
 undergrowth and farmers dislike the   
 Hunt trampling the heavy ground.      
    There is clay pigeon and pheasant  
 shooting in most parts of the area.   
    Footpaths provide plenty of quiet  
 country walks.  Walkers are respectful
 of other people's property and not    
 enough use the paths to cause erosion 
 or damage. However, they are not too  
 popular when they disturb the         
 pheasants.                            
    The Wiltshire cycleway provides a  
 pleasant ride through the countryside.
    Another popular pastime is         
 gardening.  Both vegetables and       
 flowers are grown.
