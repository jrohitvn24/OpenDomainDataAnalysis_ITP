   There is not much crime in          
 Kislingbury because it's a small      
 village and there are not many        
 nightclubs in the area.Over the{M1}   
 there is a bridge which has a {SPEED  
{TRAP}because drivers go too fast over 
 the bridge.                           
 In Harpole the police are very good.  
 They work in different regions. There 
 is never much free time at the        
 station.Over the county there are only
 eight police dogs.There is not much   
 crime but that there is, is           
 usually committed by men rather than  
 women . There is not much lost        
 property but when it is handed in it  
 goes straight to{CAMPBELL SQUARE,     
{NORTHAMPTON.}The most common crime in 
 Harpole is theft.Also people are more 
 aware of crimes so they put more locks
 on doors and windows.                 </content>
