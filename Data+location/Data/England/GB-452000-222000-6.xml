		<title>06 MANOR FARM</title>
		<content>    Manor Farm is similar to the other 
farms at the estate.It is managed by   
Colin Hilsden on behalf of the estate  
(which was sold on July 12th 1985).    
It is 412 acres in size and is a mixed 
farm.Crops grown are Winter            
Wheat,Winter Barley, Winter oats,      
Spring Barley and peas for             
fodder.Stock consists of 450 ewes and  
105 cattle-50 Fresians heifers for     
breeding purposes and the rest are     
Beef.The age of the farm is uncertain  
but some labourers  cottages are dated 
1879.It is not thought that the sale of
the estate will bring about any changes
to the management of this farm.        
    Public footpaths exist across the  
farm but at present are overgrown.
