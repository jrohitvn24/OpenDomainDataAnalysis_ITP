		<content>   {Nursling Primary School}is a Church
 of England Controlled state school, on
 the edge of{Nursling}village. It is on
 the outskirts of{Southampton}but does 
 not come within the Southampton       
 Education Office Area.                
    The headmaster,Mr D.J.Smart, told  
 us it was opened in 1960. It is a day 
 school and the pupils come from the   
 village and surrounding area.         
    There are{106 pupils}and{5 teachers
 but only{4 classes}. The largest class
 has 28 pupils, the smallest has 24.   
 There is a school uniform.            
    The school has a playing field, but
 does not have a swimming pool or a    
 library. There is no school bus. They 
 have three pianos, one computer, a tv 
 and video. There are no showers. They 
 do not set homework and they do have  
 school discos. Being such a small     
 school brings the danger of closure.  </content>
