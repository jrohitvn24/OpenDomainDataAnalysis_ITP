		<content> Customs and traditions have evolved   
 from the Church.                      
 In January the farmers of the parish  
 attend the annual{Blessing of the     
{Plough Service.}In August St.         
 Bartholemew's Day is celebrated       
 by a gift evening, when every house-  
 hold  in the parish is asked to make a
 contribution toward the upkeep of the 
 Church. In October, the{Harvest       
{Festival}is held to give thanks for   
 the year's harvest. In addition to the
 Sunday services Evensong is said the  
 preceding Friday. Gifts of produce are
 distributed to the sick and elderly.  
 At{Christmas}time a traditional carol 
 service of nine lessons and carols is 
 held and every house in the parish is 
 visited by carol singers. At this     
 time the Vicar and wardens dispense   
{charity money}to the poor of the      
 parish.                               </content>
