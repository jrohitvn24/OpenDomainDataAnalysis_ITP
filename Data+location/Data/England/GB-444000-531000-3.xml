		<title>03Elwick Village (Continued)</title>
		<content> Near the village is a man-made pond   
 which we think is a{medieval fish farm
 a derelict{windmill}and an old        
{machine gun post}from the  Second     
 World War . The houses in the village 
 are interesting;some of the houses    
 are hundreds of years old,but are now 
 made to look new and some of the new  
 houses around the green are made to   
 look old! The new houses have white   
 fronts on them and small panes of     
 glass in the windows,and the old      
 houses have been repaired to look as  
 new.
