		<content>  5)A middle aged lady told us that if 
 there were any more shops it would    
 spoil the village. The woman has lived
 in Smalley 25 years.                  
 Another old man told us he had been   
 living in Smalley 79 years.  He said  
 that there are not as many vandals as 
 there used to be, people seem to be   
 more responsible now.                 
 7)A young girl who had lived in       
 Smalley 2 years said that she wished  
 the main road was not there.          
 8)In the garage the young lad said    
 that there are not many trouble-makers
 about. He sells 20 cans of petrol/oil 
 and he repairs about 20 cars a week.  
 9)In the Nags Head Public House the   
 landlord told us that he got quite    
 alot of custom in the pub from the    
 village and the area around.
