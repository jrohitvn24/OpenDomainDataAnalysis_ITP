		<title>14HOUSES IN HELSTON</title>
		<content> Many of the houses in Helston have    
 been built in the last twenty years.  
 There are large estates of houses     
 owned and maintained by Kerrier       
 District Council. The most recent of  
 these was completed during 1985.      
      In addition there are housing    
 estates for naval personnel from      
 R.N.A.S. Culdrose. There are also many
 privately owned houses on small       
 estates.                              
      Most of the older houses are     
 situated along the main roads leading 
 into the town. The older type of      
 houses are built of granite but more  
 recent buildings consist of brick,    
 concrete and wood.                    
      The most significant development 
 in house building has been the        
 widespread use of double glazing and  
 cavity insulation to conserve heat.
