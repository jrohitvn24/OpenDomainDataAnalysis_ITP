The third main communiction link in    
the valley is the canal.This was once  
a signiicant goods routeway which      
linked Paddington in London with the   
manufacturing centres of Birmingham    
and Manchester. The Grand Union Canal  
is still used today exclusively as a   
recreational resource. Many holiday    
makers use the canal and it is         
possible to hire narrow boats in the   
town.                                  
                                       
Due to the heavy road traffic in the   
town a by-pass has been planned, since 
the 1930's! The latest route will cut  
through agricultural land and run      
close to expensive residential         
property.The latest news is that this  
long awaited and needed by-pass is now 
to be delayed until 1989 at the        
earliest.                              </content>
