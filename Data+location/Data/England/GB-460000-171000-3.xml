		<title>03FARMING - FARM WORKERS</title>
		<content> Machinery and modern technology have  
 greatly reduced the number of people  
 employed on the Home Farm. The Farm   
 covers an area of 2350 acres. It has 8
 tractors and 2 combines which are     
 maintained by mechanics and the       
 drivers on the Farm wherever possible.
 Training of the Farm Managers and     
 workers takes place at college and on 
 the Farm itself - where courses are   
 set up as the need arises. Additional 
 help is required at harvest time when 
 contract workers are employed. A      
 micro-computer at Chalkpit Farm and a 
 mini-computer at the Estate Office    
 keep farm accounts and records. They  
 deal with both wages and the cash     
 turnover of the Farm. Two part-time   
 secretaries are employed in the Farm  
 Office doing clerical work and the    
 computer accounts.
