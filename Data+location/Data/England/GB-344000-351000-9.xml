		<title>09EMPLOYMENT IN TILSTON</title>
		<content> Most people have to go out of the area
 for employment and the majority of    
 workers travel between{10 and 20      
{miles}to their places of employment.  
   The main source of employment within
 the block is{farming,}which provide   
 full time employment for about{10%}of 
 the working population. There is a    
{dairy}nearby which packages milk.     
   Part time{domestic work}is provided 
 by some large houses, the two public  
 houses and the school. Nowadays more  
 people choose to live in the rural    
 areas and most of these are employed  
 in{Wrexham, the Wirral and in Chester.
 Several professional people live in   
 the block.                            
   There is little employment for      
 youngsters leaving school although    
 this does not appear to be such a big 
 problem here as it is in the nearby   
 towns.                                </content>
