		<title>20Newington House &amp; Village</title>
		<content> Newington is a village of some 30     
houses, half old, cottage type         
dwellings. Three houses are being      
built.                                 
  Although the parish is served by the 
same vicar as Chalgrove, the village   
identifies more with Stadhampton.      
There are no facilities whatsoever.    
                                       
Newington House is suspected to have   
been built circa 1640; making it the   
first Italian Renaissance style        
country house yet identified in this   
country. The owner Mr.C.Maltin intends 
restoring it to its original           
condition.  The steepled church has    
charm but looks to be in a poor state  
of repair.                             
 The road which winds through the      
village carries fast, through traffic  
from the M40 towards Reading. The foot 
path is inadequate.                    </content>
