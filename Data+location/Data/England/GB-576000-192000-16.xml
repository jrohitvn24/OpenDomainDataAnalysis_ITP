		<content> There are three acres of glasshouses  
 with gas fired underfloor heating and 
 automatic sprinklers.A computer copes 
 with environmental conditions and     
 regulates temperature and irrigation. 
 Windows are automatic.Currently,the   
 nursery is changing from wood framed  
 to aluminium framed windows.There are 
 two taps in each greenhouse,one for   
 water and one for water plus          
 fertiliser.Pot plants,bedding plants, 
 perennials and vegetables are grown.  
 Marigolds are the most popular plants.
 Machinery includes a sowing machine to
 sow seeds;a soil mixer to mix sterile 
 soil with peat and grit;a machine to  
 fill trays and pots with soil and a   
 labelling machine.Ten people are      
 employed.Two women had potted up 5000 
 plants between them on the day we     
 visited.                              
                                       </content>
