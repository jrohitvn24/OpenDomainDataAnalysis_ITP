		<title>18HARRIS COACHES</title>
		<content> Harris coaches have been operating    
 from Summercourt for 20 years.Before  
 that they were centred in the nearby  
 village of Fraddon.There are 7 coaches
 with 8 men employed.There are 4       
 fulltime drivers,3 part time and 1    
 fitter.They run services from St.     
 Stephens to Truro daily,Wednesdays and
 Saturdays from St.Columb to Truro,    
 Fridays from St.Eval to Truro,Tuesdays
 St.Dennis to Truro and in Summer time 
 every Thursday they run to Plymouth   
 while in winter once a month on       
 Thursdays.They have school and        
 local club contracts which occupy the 
 coaches fully.The new garage has been 
 used for 4 years.The cost of the      
 services offered are very reasonably  
 priced,for example,from St.Columb to  
 Truro is one pound return which covers
 a distance of 30 miles.
