 Our block is composed of 3 features,  
 St Mawgan village, Watergate Bay and  
 RAF St Mawgan. As Watergate beach cuts
 into another block we have largely    
 ignored this feature. St Mawgan is a  
 lively, picturesque village nestling  
 in the Vale of Lanherne. It is noted  
 for its festivals- feast day, church  
 flower festival, rotary club fair,    
 church summer fair.It is a warm and   
 friendly village. A settlement has    
 existed on this sight from at least   
 Roman times, possibly due to tin      
 streaming. Lanherne is one of the few 
 wooded valleys on the north coast of  
 Cornwall. Farming,tourism and RAF     
 provide most employment. RAF St Mawgan
 is a military airfield, reconnaisance 
 Nimrods of 42 squadron are based here.
 On the same site is a civil airfield  
 which has future growth potential.    </content>
