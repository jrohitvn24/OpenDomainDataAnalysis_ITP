		<title>09WINCHCOMBE ROAD NURSERIES</title>
		<content> In Winchcombe Road there is a large   
 nursery with many glasshouses.  The   
 whole area of the nursery covers      
 approx 3\ acres.  Over 1\ acres is    
 covered in glasshouses.  The nursery  
 supplies the markets in Pershore and  
 Cheltenham.  The glasshouses are      
 heated by oil fired heating.  In the  
 summer the nursery which is owned by  
 Mr Andrews grows tomatoes and         
 cucumbers.  In the winter most of the 
 glasshouses are used to grow lettuces 
 and spring onions.  During the summer 
 Mr Andrews has about 7 staff helping  
 with produce but not necessarily all  
 at one time.  Mr Andrews' family have 
 owned the nursery for the last 22     
 years.
