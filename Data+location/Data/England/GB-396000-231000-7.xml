		<content> A contrast is evident between the     
 attitude  prevalent in the two        
 villages.{Alstone}has a strong        
 community spirit.Most of the villages 
 are known to each other and unite for 
 all the annual festivities such as    
 Harvest,Christmas , Summer fetes and  
 sports.They work very hard for their  
 own community,nurturing the           
 young,caring for the old and calling  
 little upon state aid.                
 Teddington has less community spirit  
 due to an influx of new families      
 without roots in the village and whose
 leisure activities are largely catered
 for by their employers beyond the     
 village.There are,still,older         
 residents who remember the village    
 before these changes occurred.
