		<content>People move in around Perrton in a     
variety of ways. Most people travel by 
motor vehicles around the area and     
towards Wolverhampton, Telford and     
Bridgnorth.                            
   Few people walk except along the    
pedestrisan lanes that lead to the     
Shops, Schools and other places of     
intrest. There are a number of         
pleasant walks that can take you into  
the countryside or towards             
Tettenhall.                            
  Others cycle to work because we are  
so  close to Wolverhampton taking      
advantage of purpose lanes.            
  The Bus Service goes to Wolverhampton
and other nearby towns on a rugular    
basis. Not many people use the uses    
because of the high cost of the fares. 
   It is the Car which is the most     
popular form of transport.
