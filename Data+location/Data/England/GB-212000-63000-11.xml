		<content>{Dead Field:}Mr.Terry of Tithe Hall    
 told us about a particular field which
 had to be kept unploughed,otherwise a 
 child in the family would die.He said 
 it went back to the time when there   
 was a high death rate amongst infants.
{Tumuli:}Near this school is a Tumulus 
 and it is said that a ghost has been  
 seen waving a sword and blowing a long
 bugle.This dates back to the Civil    
 War.A battle was fought near here     
{Grey Mare:}There is supposed to be a  
 ghost at Grey Mare every 100 years.A  
 man rides a grey mare but "mare" in   
 Cornish means stone.There is a        
 boundary stone on the farm.           
{Grandfather Clock:}When the Clock fell
 over three times a member of the Whell
 family of Kenna Coombe Farm died.The  
 clock has now been destroyed!
