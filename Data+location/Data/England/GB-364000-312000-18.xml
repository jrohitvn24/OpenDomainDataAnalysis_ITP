		<content> Our typical{homes}are detached and    
 semi-detached houses,and flats.Most of
 our homes have about 500 square metres
 of garden,with a garage and a shed of 
 some sort.The most common materials   
 used to build our houses are          
 bricks,tiles,glass,wood,cement and    
 various metals.Nearly all our houses  
 have drains,water and electricity     
 supplies,and many have gas and        
 telephone.Most houses have{gardens    
 with fences or hedges  around,but some
 are open gardens,especially at the    
 front.Many homes are very well        
 insulated since heating costs have    
 risen,and have doubleglazing,         
 fibreglass loft insulation,and some   
 have cavity wall insulation.Most homes
 have central heating in some way and  
 fitted carpets.They have comfortable  
 furnishings and many electrical and   
 electronic appliances.                </content>
