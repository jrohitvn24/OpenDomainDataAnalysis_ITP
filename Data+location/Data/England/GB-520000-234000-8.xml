 Stotfold it makes iron into many      
 different things.John Day started this
 business and his son soon became      
 interested.They have been going for 36
 years. Mr. Twigg has been working     
 there for 26 years.He is a very       
 skilled blacksmith.He wanted to be a  
 blacksmith from the age of 4.We met   
 someone called Stephen.He was making a
 spiral so that he could finish off a  
 gate.Then we went to see Mr. Twigg.He 
 showed us lots of things and let us   
 have some tools,like a fuller and a   
 swage these are only some of          
 them.Then                             
 we asked Mr. Day some questions.He led
 us into the show room.In there he     
 talked to us about the things they    
 make.They make gates,weather vanes,   
 lamp holders,fire escapes and         
 fireplace furniture.                  </content>
