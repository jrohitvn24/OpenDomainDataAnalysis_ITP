		<content> My name is Saira. I have been in this 
 school for six years.This school was  
 built 85 years ago.It is made from red
 bricks. This school has 3 floors.I am 
 on the middle floor.We can get to the 
 middle floors by slopes.There are     
 ropes on the walls instead of hand    
 rails.On the middle floor there is    
 also the M6 Theatre Company.In our    
 school there are 15 classrooms. there 
 is also a Remedial Reading            
 room.Children from other schools come 
 to read in our Remedial Reading room. 
     In our school we had a home safety
 competition, and we won.We won Â£50 and
 a shield.Some children went to see the
 Mayor.                                
     In our school there are some      
 children fasting.Fasting is a part of 
 the Muslim Religion.Eid is a Muslim   
 Celebration.This is when people wear  
 nice clothes,jewellery and make-up.   </content>
