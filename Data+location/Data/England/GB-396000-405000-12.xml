		<content>   Some of the old mills have been     
{converted to other uses,}such as the  
 Compoflex firm which produces flexible
 plastic hoses.                        
   Delph's rail link has long been     
 severed and the{old station}is now a  
 physiotherapist's clinic and in the   
 station yard there is a plant hire    
 contractor and mountains of crushed   
 rock salt used by Oldham M.B.C.       
 Highways Department on the winter     
 roads.                                
   The{centre of the village}contains  
 most of the{shops and services}that   
 are needed for everyday use. There are
 also several craft shops, cafes and   
 'olde worlde' pubs which cater for the
 tourists who come to see this pretty  
 village and take walks in the upper   
 Tame valley.
