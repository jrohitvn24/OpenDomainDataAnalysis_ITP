		<content>    In our survey area there are       
 several scattered farmhouses but only 
 one real area of much housing. That is
 the village of White Notley.          
    The houses as they stand now are   
 not very old; in Vicararge Avenue the 
 Council Houses were built in about    
 1950 but were not intended to be in   
 use for as long as they have been.    
 Some people have bought their Council 
 House and many of the others have     
 recently had their original windows   
 replaced with new ones which have hard
 wood frames.                          
    There are some newer brick built   
 houses built in the 1960s and early   
 1970s in The Street and these are     
 nearly all privately owned.           
    There is a group of houses around  
 the pub and the shop which are older. 
 This is at the middle of the village  
 where two roads meet.                 </content>
