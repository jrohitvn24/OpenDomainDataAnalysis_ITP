		<title>09The Garages</title>
		<content> In our area there are two garages, one
 is called the Complex 57 and is on the
 A57 road towards Lincoln. It is next  
 to Uncle Toms Cabin cafe. Although at 
 some time it used to sell petrol it   
 now only sells and services cars. The 
 road has been straightened at this    
 point and so it is now situated in a  
 lay-by. Apart from the cafe there are 
 only two other houses near the garage.
                                       
 In Skellingthorpe village there is one
 garage owned by Mr Dixon who has lived
 in the village all his life. He       
 started his garage business in 1958   
 and at one time employed six people   
 but now only employs one. The garage  
 sells second hand cars, petrol,       
 carries out servicing, maintainance   
 and M.O.T. testing.
