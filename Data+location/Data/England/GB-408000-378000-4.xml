		<content> Cattle are kept both for{dairy and    
{beef}and are usually kept outside in  
 the fields in summer time.            
 Their{winter feed}is silage and hay.  
 Beef cattle are sold at markets around
 the area.Cattle are{milked}by machine 
 twice a day and the milking parlour   
 has to be very clean ,it is an        
 expensive investment for the farmer   
 and some have computers to control    
 feed.                                 
 All milk is stored in a tank and      
 taken away by road tanker -it is      
 purchased by the{Milk Marketing       
{Board.                                
 Recently many farms have had to       
 cut down on milk production and keep  
 to a{quota.                           
 This has made life difficult for some 
 farmers.The quota is controlled by the
 government through the{E.E.C.
