		<title>08CLUBS IN STANHOE</title>
		<content> Thirty years ago Stanhoe could boast  
 of a Football, Cricket, Bowls and     
 Darts Club as well as a Youth Club,   
 but with a falling population and less
 young people these are now closed.    
 Only Stanhoe &amp; Barwick Women's        
 Institute has been continuously active
 since it was founded in 1919 and still
 has twenty members who meet regularly 
 every month for talks and             
 demonstrations.  This year members    
 have attended meetings in Norwich and 
 enjoyed outings to Northamptonshire   
 and to Oxburgh in Norfolk.  Fund      
 raising events for local charities are
 a feature.  The Social Club, founded  
 seven years ago arranges indoor       
 sports, whistdrives and dances as well
 as managing the running of the Village
 Hall.  This year has seen the         
 re-forming of the football club.
