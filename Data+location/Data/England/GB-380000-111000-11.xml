		<title>11FORESTRY IN SHILLINGSTONE</title>
		<content> The main part of Shillingstone Hill   
 was planted with Beech,Oak,Spruce     
 Fir,Douglas Fir,Corsican Pine and     
 Scots Pine approximately 30 years     
 ago.There are areas of Oak woodland   
 left for conservation,which provide a 
 natural habitat for wildlife.         
 The deer in these woods are           
 Roe,Sika,Fallow and a few Munjac      
 (Chinese Water deer).These are culled 
 throughout the shooting season.       
 Pheasant shooting has greatly improved
 sinse the thinning of the             
 woods.Buzzards have bred here and can 
 be seen over Shillingstone.           
 Most of the woods in the area are     
 owned and managed by the the Forestry 
 Commission.There are many walks and   
 picnic areas.A large number of people 
 are employed in thinning and felling  
 the timber.
