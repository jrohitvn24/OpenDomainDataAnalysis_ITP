		<title>13Winchfield - Social Concerns</title>
		<content> The{expansion of Fleet}west of Hitches
 Lane is the greatest concern of Winch-
 field residents. 'Winchfield Court' - 
 33 luxury houses must be a 'one-off'  
 development &amp; any similar projects    
 will be discouraged. 10 houses are    
 proposed for  Winchfield Hurst. Rail- 
 road Heath is also ripe for develop-  
 ment &amp; plans are being discussed.     
 There are{no doctor's or dentist's    
{surgeries}within the block &amp; with the 
 threatened closure of Fleet Hospital  
 the nearest hospital will be Frimley  
 or Basingstoke. Much of the area isn't
 on{mains drainage.}Should 'Old Barley 
 Mow Farmhouse' be converted into a    
 restaurant? There are conflicting     
 views over the need for{industrial    
{units at Winchfield Station.}There is 
 a{campaign for a swimming pool}in     
 Hart District &amp; the Leisure Centre is 
 a possible site.                      </content>
