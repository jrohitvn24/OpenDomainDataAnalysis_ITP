		<title>12ATHERSLEY SCHOOLS VANDALISM.</title>
		<content> Out of fifteen schools in the         
 Athersley and Mapplewell area only two
 schools have not had broken windows   
 and one school has had one hundred and
 forty four windows smashed.           
 All the schools except three have some
 graffiti on outside walls and fences  
 which have also been damaged. Broken  
 glass has been found on school        
 playgrounds at seven different        
 schools. Plants and trees in the      
 school grounds at two of these seven  
 schools have been damaged. A few      
 schools have had evidence of glue     
 sniffers and all the schools          
 complained about stray dogs wandering 
 in the play areas.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
