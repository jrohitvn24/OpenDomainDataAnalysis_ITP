		<content> On Foxley Farm, part of which comes in
 our area,{vegetable crops}are being   
 grown. These include carrots,spinach, 
 cabbage and spring onions at present  
 but other crops will be grown in      
 rotation. We saw tractor trailers     
 laden with some of these crops and    
 wanted to know where they were going. 
 We visited the{packing sheds}which are
 at another farm owned by the same     
 farming family although it was outside
 our area.When the crops arrive they   
 are stored in ice bank coolers until  
 they are prepared for market.The crops
 are tipped onto a moving belt where   
 they are sorted and packed into trays,
 boxes or polythene bags.When sealed in
 the packs they are weighed and priced 
 before being sent to{supermarkets.    
 The farmer also has a stand at{Covent 
{Garden and a farm shop.}Some produce  
 is sent to{local shops}unpackaged.    </content>
