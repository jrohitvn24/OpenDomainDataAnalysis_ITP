		<content>   Our block is made up of some very   
 contrasting landuses, the most        
 important being{rural farmland,}with 8
 out of the 12 squares being dominated 
 by pastural or arable farming.        
   In the east the most dominant       
 feature is the A19 Trunk Road and the 
 outer edge of Sunderland. The A19     
 forms a man-made boundary to the urban
 spread of Wearside and also provides a
 much needed by-pass for traffic moving
 between Teesside and Tyneside.        
   In the south west corner there lies 
 the small industrial villages of      
 Shiney Row, New and West Herrington,  
 Philadelphia and Penshaw.Penshaw is   
 the only village that reflects a      
 pre-industrial revolution origin.     
   These villages are separated from   
 Sunderland by a{green belt}and so     
 this block can be descibed as{"Urban  
{Fringe Land".                         </content>
