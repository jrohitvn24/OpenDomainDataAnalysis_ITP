		<title>01A GENERAL VIEW OF THE AREA.</title>
		<content>Our area is a rural area on the edge   
of the city of Lichfield, and the      
village of Whittington. A large new    
housing development is spreading out   
from Lichfield into the surrounding    
countryside, but other than this, our  
area contains very few houses or       
amenities.                             
  The most outstanding features are a  
large golf course, a Youth Custody     
Centre at Swinfen Hall, Whittington    
Barracks and King Edward VI            
Comprehensive School.                  
  The area also contains the tiny      
village of Botany Bay, a number of     
small farms and one major road, the    
A 38 that goes from Derby into         
Birminham.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
