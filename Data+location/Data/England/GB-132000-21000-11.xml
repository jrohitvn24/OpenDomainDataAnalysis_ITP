		<content>       Smuggling at Nanjizel.          
 It was night we were smuggling fifty  
 crates of champayne. We had a big     
 boat and four small boats. The little 
 boats would take ten crates of        
 champayne each. When we got near the  
 shore we stopped our engines and got  
 our little boats out and loaded them  
 with champayne then we got to shore.  
 We were looking out for police and    
 coastguards. The shore was rocky.     
 And there was lots of sea weed. One of
 the boats went back to get the other  
 ten crates.                           
 Then we heard shouting, the police and
 the customs men were coming!          
 We all scrambled in the little boats  
 and rowed back to our large boat. The 
 police were shooting at us but we     
 escaped because the cliff got in their
 way. It was a lucky escape this time!
