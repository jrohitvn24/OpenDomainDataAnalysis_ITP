		<content> The two local hairdressers are well   
 patronised, with up to 500 customers  
 each week: although many people say   
 they prefer home hairdressing or      
 visiting salons in Brighton or        
 Eastbourne.  Local cafes report up to 
 1,000 customers a day and local people
 agree that they visit a cafe or       
 restaurant at least once a week.      
 Bingo is played at Newhaven's Social  
 Club, although the majority of people 
 questioned maintained they did not    
 gamble at all, but preferred to visit 
 public houses for entertainment.      
 Pop culture does not cause much       
 concern, although many people did not 
 wish to become involved.  Most people 
 preferred pop music to any other kind,
 with "Wham" as their favourite group. 
 "Coronation Street" was a firm        
 television favourite.
