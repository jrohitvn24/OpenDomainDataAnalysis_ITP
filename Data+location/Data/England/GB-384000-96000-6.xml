		<title>06  Elderton Clump.</title>
		<content>       The most prominent landmark in  
 the district is Elderton Clump. It is 
 a group of pine trees on the highest  
 point of West Down, and it is clearly 
 visible from most parts of the area.  
 It was obviously a place of some      
 importance in prehistoric times, since
 there are many remains of the Iron Age
 in the vicinity. There are the remains
 of many round barrows, all of which   
 have been excavated and any material  
 from them is in the Dorset County     
 Museum. Elderton Clump was also the   
 meeting place of a number of          
 prehistoric tracks, and the Roman road
 to Dorchester passes close by. There  
 is also much other evidence of        
 intensive occupation during Iron Age  
 and Roman times. The clump also marks 
 the boundary between Winterborne      
 Kingston and Bere Regis.
