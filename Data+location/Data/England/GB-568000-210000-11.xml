  I get up about 6:15 a.m. then I get  
 dressed and have a bowl of cereal     
 after which I get on my bike and go to
 see my pony.                          
                                       
  I have to muck out the stable, put   
 some water in his bucket and fill the 
 hay net. Afterwards I meet my mum     
 about 8:45 a.m..She sees me across the
 road to school .I come home at 12:00  
 o'clock to have lunch, we come back to
 school at five to one do some more    
 work.At school we do Maths,English and
 Sport.Sometimes we have a ghost-story.
                                       
  Home from school and back to my      
 pony.I put on his saddle and bridle   
 and I canter,trot and walk until about
 8:00 I go home and at 9:00 I go to    
 bed.
