		<content>  The practice of Christianity has     
 waned in recent years and there is    
 evidence of church closures and       
 joining up of small congregations due 
 to falling attendances. The majority  
 of places of worship are C of E and   
 Roman Catholic churches with some     
 non_conformist ones. All these have   
 services in the morning and evening.  
 There is also a Christian Science     
 meeting place, a Jehovah's Witness, a 
 Mormon meeting place and a Salvation  
 Army Hall. The area also has a        
 synagogue and a Hindu Centre and      
 Temple. Although the Hindu community  
 is small the attendances at their     
 temple are higher than for the        
 Christian churches. Although interest 
 in Christianity has waned there has   
 been an increase in the use of        
 churches for the community. Various   
 groups meet in many of the churches.  </content>
