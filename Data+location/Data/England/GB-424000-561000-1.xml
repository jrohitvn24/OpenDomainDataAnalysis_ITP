		<title>01GATESHEAD AND NEWCASTLE</title>
		<content>   This area covers most of GATESHEAD  
 and a small section of NEWCASTLE in   
 the N.W. corner of the block.Gateshead
 is separated from Newcastle by the{   
{River Tyne}which is crossed by six    
 bridges within a very short distance, 
 three of them carrying {rail}traffic  
 into the{Central Station.} Not far    
 from here stands the{Cathedral.}The   
 north bank of the river farther       
 downstream used to be very busy but{  
{shipbuilding}is now in decline.       
   Although there are areas of light   
 industry,{Gateshead}is mainly         
 residential with a large proportion of
 older or council owned property.      
 However there are several areas where 
 redevelopment is taking place.        
 Gateshead's main claim to fame is its 
{international athletics stadium}which 
 has built its reputation from nothing 
 during the last six or seven years.   </content>
