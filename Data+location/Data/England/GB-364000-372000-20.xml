		<content> EVER SINCE ROMAN TIMES NORTHWICH AND  
 ITS SURROUNDING AREAS HAS BEEN LINKED 
 TO SALT.SALT IS THE REASON WHY THE    
 TOWN IS HERE.THERE IS A SALT MUSEUM   
 WHICH SHOWS HOW THE INDUSTRY HAS      
 DEVELOPED FROM EARLY DAYS TO THE      
 PRESENT DAY PROCESSES.                
 ALL AROUND NORTHWICH THERE ARE        
 EXAMPLES OF HOW THE SALT INDUSTRY HAS 
 LEFT ITS MARK ON THE LANDSCAPE.THERE  
 ARE "FLASHES" OR WASTE AREAS WHERE    
 NOTHING WILL GROW,MERES WHERE BRINE   
 PUMPING HAS CAUSED THE COLLAPSE OF THE
 LAND AND NUMEROUS BUILDINGS WHICH HAVE
 SUNK.THE WHITE LION HOTEL IN THE TOWN 
 CENTRE HAS SUNK ONE FLOOR SO THAT     
 THE PRESENT GROUND FLOOR WAS          
 ORIGINALLY THE FIRST FLOOR AND THE    
 PRESENT CELLAR HAS WINDOWS AND DOORS  
 WHICH DON'T LEAD ANYWHERE. AT PRESENT 
 THE SALT INDUSTRY HAS MOVED MAINLY TO 
 NEARBY WINSFORD AND{MIDDLEWICH.       </content>
