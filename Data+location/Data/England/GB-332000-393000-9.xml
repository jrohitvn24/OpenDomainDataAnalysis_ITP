		<content>   The{docks}are located to the west of
 our block.They stretch from{Seaforth  
 to{Dingle.}The{docks}which are located
 within our area include;{Gladstone,   
{Hornby and Alexandra Docks.}Over the  
 past thirty years there have been many
 changes in the{dockland}area of       
{Bootle.}The{docks}began to decline,   
 factories closed, warehouses became   
 empty.Many of these buildings were    
 knocked down.If you walk around the   
 streets,  you can see large areas of  
 derelict land which is no longer      
 used.{Unemployment}in the area has    
 increased because people lost their   
 jobs and factories closed down.       
 However,the{docks}are now growing in  
 importance again and there are new    
{industries}coming to the area.The area
 has become a{Freeport}and there is now
 a containerbase,a grain terminal and a
 large scrap metal trade.{(James Evans)</content>
