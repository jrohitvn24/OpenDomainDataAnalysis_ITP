		<content> Rothbury is surrounded by hills and   
 moorland where you can see the hardier
 breeds of sheep such as the "Cheviot" 
 and "Blackface" grazing.  Generally   
 the land is fenced but you have to    
 drive carefully because there are     
 places where they can wander onto the 
 road.                                 
 The Ministry of Defence ranges are on 
 the moorland and there are warning    
 signs. The hills are mainly covered in
 rough grass, bracken and heather. The 
 soil is acidic because of the peat so 
 plants which like such conditions grow
 well there. Spent cartridges and rifle
 shells are often picked up near the   
 Ministry of Defence range but these   
 can be dangerous to handle. There is  
 also a wartime aircraft buried in the 
 peat and a friend of mine has a small 
 piece of it.
