		<content>  There used to be a lot of orchard    
 around Ulcombe but over the years     
 there has been a{steady decline}as    
 orchards have been torn out and       
 ploughed up for use as barly          
 fields.There are still a lot of apple 
 and cherry orchards around but not as 
 many as there used to be.As well as   
 apples and cherries there are         
 strawberries,rasberries,logonberries, 
 kob nuts,hazel nuts,cultivated        
 blackberries,red currants and black   
 currants.{Loganberries, rasberries,   
{black currants and red currants}are   
 usually not grown on large farms but  
 on small-holdings.Around us there are 
{quite a lot of small-holdings and     
{nurseries}which sell fresh fruit and  
 plants.                               
{ }  At the local farm they sell pick  
 your own and sometimes allready picked
 apples and strawberries.              </content>
