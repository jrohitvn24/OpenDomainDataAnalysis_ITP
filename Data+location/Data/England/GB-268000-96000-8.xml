		<title>08SPREYTON CHURCH BELL RINGERS</title>
		<content>    In the tower of St.Michael's       
 Church,Spreyton,there are six bells   
 dating back to 1695.                  
    There are sixteen bell ringers     
 including learners.                   
    The bells are rung on most Sundays 
 for the service and every Tuesday     
 evening,during the winter for         
 practising.                           
    The annual St. Michael's Fayre,held
 in June,was started, as a result of a 
 competition among different parishes, 
 for the Viscount Lambert Bell Ringers 
 Shield.                               
    During the winter months,the       
 parishes of South Tawton, Bow and     
 Spreyton join in a league and an      
 outing takes place for the ringers to 
 visit other towers in Devon.          
    Ken Vile teaches the new ringers   
 and Will Towell,the captain,has been  
 ringing for sixty eight years.        </content>
