		<content> Many big companies such as A.R.C.,    
 Redland and Tarmac quarry in the local
 area.  The quarries make sand and     
 gravel.  Many acres of ground in this 
 area are quarried every year.  About  
 two hundred and fifty local people are
 employed in the quarrying business.   
 Some people drive the lorries and some
 people work in the offices.  When they
 have finished quarrying they restore  
 some of the ground.  It is then used  
 again for agriculture.  All the sand  
 and stone goes into making ready mixed
 concrete, tiles, bricks and asphalt.  
 Limestone from Derbyshire and granite 
 from Leicestershire are also used with
 the sand.  Draglines, loading shovels 
 and dumpers are used in the quarries. 
 The quarries are dangerous and have   
 high fences around them to keep out   
 children.  There are some areas of    
 quicksand.                            </content>
