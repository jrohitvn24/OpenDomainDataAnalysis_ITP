		<title>10Farming (Romney Marsh)</title>
		<content>    The land is bisected by the Royal  
 Military Canal above which the        
 escarpment rises to sixty metres and  
 is mainly rough grazing for cattle and
 sheep with some broad leaved woodland.
    To the seaward side of the canal is
 ancient reclaimed marsh still partly  
 traditionally farmed with sheep on    
 permanent pasture. But in the last    
 fifty years more than half the acreage
 has been under the plough and is down 
 to cereals with oil seed rape and     
 potatoes as break crops, returning in 
 rotation to grazing with new leys.    
    Here you will find the traditional 
 hardy Romney Marsh sheep which still  
 lamb in the open protected only by    
 wattle sheep folds.                   
    Dykes were originally excavated for
 drainage but now serve as field       
 boundaries as well as for irrigation.
