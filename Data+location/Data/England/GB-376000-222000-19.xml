		<title>19RIVER LEADON</title>
		<content> The River Leadon has its source at    
 Evensbach near Ledbury and flows      
 through a picturesque and winding     
 valley to join the River Severn via a 
 floodgate near Over Bridge. It forms a
 natural boundary between the parishes 
 of Hartpury and Highleadon. In the    
 past its flow drove the mills at      
 Rudford, Upleadon and Hartpury.       
 Collier's Brook joins the River Leadon
 at Wedderburn Bridge; the Bridge and  
 Park Road were opened in 1908. The    
 area today is used for recreation, by 
 artists, and fishermen (for tench,    
 roach, eel, pike). The Severn and     
 Trent Water Authority are responsible 
 for the maintenance of the            
 watercourses and have recently        
 dredged both the river and the brook  
 to alleviate the problem of flooding  
 in the surrounding area.
