		<content> In Shaw we have several Churches. St. 
 James' Church does lots of services   
 like weddings,funerals and            
 christenings. There are bell ringing  
 lessons and a youth club.They also    
 have a Sunday School.A long time ago  
 they built a church called St.        
 Saviours' Mission Church because      
 it was a long way to walk to St.      
 James' if you lived up Buckstones     
 Road.The vicar at St.James' and       
 St.Saviours' is Mr. Bailey.           
 At Wren's Nest there is a big place   
 shaped like a wigwam.It is called     
 St.Josephs'Social Club.On Sunday the  
 Roman Catholic people go because it is
 also a church.Lots of people have     
 wedding receptions and parties        
 there.Shore Edge Methodist Church is  
 just up the road from St.Saviours'.At 
 Shore Edge they have a youth club and 
 lots of services.                     </content>
