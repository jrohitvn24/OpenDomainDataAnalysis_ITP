		<content>      Lots of children go to the{      
{playing field}after tea. There are 6  
 swings, one seesaw, one rocking boat, 
 a witch's hat and a climbing frame.   
 There are tennis courts there and the 
 Football and Cricket Clubs hold their 
 matches there.                        
      These{clubs}use the{Village      
{Institute}at the crossroads in Cliffe:
 playgroup, mothers and toddlers, Youth
 Club, keep fit, Women's Institute, and
 Friendship Club and Silver Threads for
 old people. There is Bingo in the     
 Institute on the last Tuesday in every
 month.                                
      St.Andrew's Mission Church, just 
 outside the survey area, was rebuilt  
 last year, and there is a Sunday      
 School and a Girls' Brigade there.    
     There is a small{playing field}in 
 Osgodby, but only one club, the       
 fishing club at the Wadkin Arms pub.  </content>
