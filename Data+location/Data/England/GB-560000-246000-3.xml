		<content> In autumn the plough comes along and  
 turns over and breaks up the soil for 
 the seeds.Then the power harrow breaks
 it up into smaller bits.Next comes the
 drill which blows seeds down pipes. It
 then sows 64 seeds all at once which  
 then go into the soil. Here are the   
 names of a few of the crops sown in   
 autumn. Winter barley. winter wheat,  
 oil seed rape and sugar beet. The     
 fertilizer is a special wide armed    
 sprayer and sprays its liquid all over
 the seeds to encourage growth.In      
 spring they spray for disease to kill 
 all the pests that lay their eggs on  
 the crops. Some corn is sown in spring
 this is called spring wheat and spring
 barley(which grows during the summer) 
 This is the last to be harvested.     
  Every 3rd or 4th year they grow a    
 different crop from the year before.  
 This is called a break crop.          </content>
