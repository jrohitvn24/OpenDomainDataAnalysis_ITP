    When I go to school my favourite   
 thing is Phonic Workbook and Reading  
 Workshop.  My teacher is Mrs.Hall and 
 I especially like P.E. and I like     
 coming to school. In the school       
 concert I was the Mad Hatter and I had
 to learn lots of words. It was after  
 tea and lots of people came.          
    I like playtime because I like     
 playing with Luke with my football.I  
 like P.E. because I like swinging on  
 ropes and hanging upside down.        </content>
