		<title>04Farming in Weston and Area</title>
		<content> The presence of medieval field layouts
 and ridge furrows is indicative of the
 long history of farming in this area. 
 Some families have farmed their land  
 for generations and have farmhouses   
 dating back to circa 1700 or earlier. 
                                       
 The soil in this area is reasonably   
 fertile and suitable for arable, dairy
 and mixed farming.  All the farms     
 contacted combine arable farming      
 (wheat, barley and rye grass) with    
 grazing beef cattle.                  
                                       
 The size of the farms sampled ranges  
 from 105 to 400 acres, including some 
 fields outside the area surveyed. The 
 average size of fields is 15 to 20    
 acres.  Most farms are family         
 concerns.  The owner of Oddington     
 Grange has several farms in the area  
 and has a peripatetic labour force.   </content>
