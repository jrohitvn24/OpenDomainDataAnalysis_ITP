		<content>     Mr. Bleasdale remembers as a young
 boy, with other children, his visits  
 to a local apple tree, whose branches 
 spread onto the lane convenient for   
 the children to pick apples on the way
 to and from school. These little      
 interesting excursions are not        
 available to the modern child, at     
 least in this area, the lane now      
 having become a modern metalled road. 
     He also remembers as a young boy  
 collecting coke from the Askam Gas    
 Works to suppliment their meagre coal 
 ration because of the cost of the     
 coal. Concerning todays local children
 he is of the opinion that they do not 
 have as much to do as he at their age 
 although it would appear to be a more 
 affluent society. Adults and children 
 in those days were content with the   
 simpler things of life.
