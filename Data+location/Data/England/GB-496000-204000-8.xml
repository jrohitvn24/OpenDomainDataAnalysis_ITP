		<content> Conflict of interests in rural        
 area.People want to live in           
 agricultural surroundings but object  
 to inconvenience of farming.          
 Farms being broken up and used as     
 small units, farms amalgamated and    
 hedgerows torn up for arable crops.   
 Farmers resentful of this attitude as 
 farming is their living and must be   
 done efficiently to exit, which       
 entails use of large harvesters for   
 arable crops in large fields and heavy
 trailers for sillage for dairy herds. 
 Although older inhabitants of villages
 say it has changed, new people find   
 the village freindly with good        
 community spirit.Closure of village   
 school resented,some say education    
 better in larger units

 policies.Cocern about fluoradation.
