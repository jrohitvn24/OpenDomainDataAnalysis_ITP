    It all began on April 15th 1878    
when William Sargent opened the doors  
of Ilketshall St. Lawrence Board       
School. One hundred years later and the
centenary celebrations began.          
    The school celebrated this event on
April 27th 1978 by having a special    
assembly and party. 50 special guests  
had been invited - ex headmasters, ex  
managers, Parish councillers and many  
old friends. Some planted trees, others
exchanged fond memories, whilst most   
just enjoyed the happiness of the      
occasion.                              
    The present 78 children in the     
school had made classroom displays of  
pictures, poems, stories of old school 
days and photographs.The recorders     
learnt to play "Sweet Nightingale"     
which was the first recorded school    
song.                                  </content>
