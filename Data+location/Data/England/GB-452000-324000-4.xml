		<title>04BROOKSIDE SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Brookside was opened in 1966 using new
 modern buildings and the original     
 village school, first built in 1875.As
 the village has grown it has been     
 extended twice,in 1968,when new       
 classrooms were built on the main     
 sight and in 1975 when a two classroom
 annexe was erected approximately      
 one-third of a mile from the main     
 buildings.                            
 It serves the west side of the village
 and has,at the present,365 children on
 roll.                                 
 The school has good facilities for    
 sport,having two playing fields,on one
 of which is an all-weather cricket    
 wicket.                               
 Children enter school on the Tuesday  
 after their fifth birthday and move to
 secondary education in their eleventh 
 year.
