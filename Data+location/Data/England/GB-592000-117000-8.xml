		<title>08Camber Castle.</title>
		<content>    {Camber Castle is not in the       
{village of Camber.}It was built on the
 western side of the river Rother      
 between Rye and Winchelsea Beach,as   
 part of Henry VIII's coastal          
 defences.The design of the castle is  
{flower-shaped}with rounded bastions   
 and in the 16th century it was in a   
 good position to guard Rye Bay.The    
 sea has since retreated and the castle
 is now{a mile}or so inland.           
     Camber Castle has been closed for 
 many years but is hoped to open part  
 of it in{1986-87.}Re-opening has been 
 delayed because of frost damage to the
 keep.It is being restored by English  
 Heritage and finds at the castle      
 include a{gold ring worth Â£7,000,}a   
 pike,a musket,a breech-loading gun and
 a ceramic cooking stove.
