		<content>{Line to line It-} you have to get from
 one line to another without getting   
 caught.{Stuck in the mud-}you have    
 three lives.If some one says"stuck in 
 the mud" and touches you then you are 
 on.{Hide and seek-}some one counts to 
 50 and you have to hide the first one 
 found is the next seeker.{Aeroplane-  
 you have to jump over a rope which is 
 being turned in in a circle if it hits
 you,you swing the rope.{Hot chocolate-
 is where someone is"on"at the front,  
 the person who is on turns their back 
 on the others.In bet ween that time   
 the others move a few steps and when  
 the person turns back they have to    
 stand still.If the person sees them   
 move they stand at the side with their
 arm out.When one of the others touches
 the hand,you can run away.If seen by  
 the one at the front you go to the    
 front yourself.S.Cameron &amp; W.Ross age9</content>
