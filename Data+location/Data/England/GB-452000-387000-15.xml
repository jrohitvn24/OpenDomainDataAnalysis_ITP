		<content> Lots of people who live in this area  
 go sequence dancing, so we thought we 
 would talk to two ladies who enjoy    
 this pastime.                         
   They told us that this kind of      
 dancing is so popular that people are 
 able to go every night if they travel 
 about. Dances are held in local       
 village halls and social clubs.       
   Sequence dancing is different from  
 other kinds of dancing because        
 everyone does the same steps. The     
 music is fairly modern, so you could  
 say that it is like barn dancing or   
 folk dancing to modern music. Some    
 dances are the same all over the      
 country, but  our area does have its  
 own special dances.                   
   This kind of dancing is enjoyed by  
 both young and old people and is      
 relaxing and more sociable than       
 ballrom dancing.                      </content>
