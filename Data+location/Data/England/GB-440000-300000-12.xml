		<title>12MARKET BOSWORTH PARK</title>
		<content> The park comprises approximately 0.35 
 sq.km. of open parkland and is        
 situated on the eastern approach to   
 the town of Market Bosworth.          
                                       
 Purchased in 1970 by Leicestershire   
 County Council, the park had          
 previously formed part of the grounds 
 of Bosworth Hall, home, since the late
 16th century of the Dixie family.     
 The park is open to the public during 
 daylight hours and a car park and     
 picnic area is provided.              
                                       
 At the southern extent of the park is 
 an arboretum, consisting of a wide    
 variety of Maples, Oaks, Alders and   
 Willows.  In the midst of the         
 arboretum lies an extensive lake, well
 stocked with fish and with daily      
 fishing permits available from the    
 baliff.                               </content>
