		<title>01RURAL LAND EAST OF HASLEMERE</title>
		<content> This is an area of undulating woodland
 and farmland in rural Surrey. there   
 are few roads, no railways and no     
 towns or villages. The few scattered  
 houses and farms are the only         
 settlements. Mixed farming is the main
 occupation. Much of the remaining land
 is covered by mixed woods including   
 some managed by the Forestry          
 Commissiion.  There are no manmade    
 recreational facilities in the area   
 except the Lythe Hill Hotel, which    
 offers two restaurants and            
 accommodation and one other public    
 house. There are several lakes in the 
 area used by anglers, and the         
 countryside offers many pleasant walks
 with opportunities to see the         
 plentiful roe deer. In l985 this is a 
 prosperous area and home for many who 
 commute to London and surrounding     
 towns to work.                        </content>
