		<content>Many houses were built during the last 
20 years as people from Liverpool and  
Manchester have settled here.There are 
no council houses but private estates  
of semi-detached and detached houses in
Parbold behind the Community Centre and
at Hilldale near the Post Office,built 
of brick.At Brandreth Delph there are  
22 new houses.They are of a very modern
style in reddish-brown brick,each with 
a double garage.One house is for       
sale.The estate agent's sign reads "A 5
bedroomed luxury detached property in  
large plot with picturesque lake       
nearby."There are many old stone-built 
houses and cottages one date reads     
1692,some are converted from old barns 
we noticed the circular pitching holes 
and high barn doors.The Smithy is now a
private house,the old Stores at Bispham
Green is a private residence but it has
the big shop window still at the front.</content>
