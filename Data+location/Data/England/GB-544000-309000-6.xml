		<title>06CLUB OR SHOPPING CENTRE.</title>
		<content> The 16-65 Centre in Hill St. has been 
 providing a range of activities       
 including a youth club.There are trips
 and holidays at a reasonable          
 price.Most of the boys who use the    
 club go there to BREAKDANCE which is  
 the latest craze in 1985.The girls    
 enjoy listening to the juke-box or    
 playing table-tennis.Sadly the club   
 may be knocked down so a shopping     
 centre can be built.It is possible    
 that the club could find other        
 premises such as the Queen's          
 Girls'School building which will      
 become empty in 1986 when the         
 secondary schools in Wisbech          
 reorganise.If the club can move there 
 then the people of Wisbech will be    
 able to benefit from a new shopping   
 centre and a great youth club.
