		<title>11Stock Gaylard house &amp; park</title>
		<content>   Stock Gaylard is an ancient parish  
 although the hamlet the little church 
 serves is a mile and a half away at   
 Kingstag.                             
   The present Stock House was built   
 in 1720 and is the home of the{Yeatman
 family.It is surrounded by a hundred  
 acre deer park.At present there are   
 140 fallow deer in the park which are 
 kept for 'decoration'.                
   These deer can often be seen from   
 the road and there is a local saying  
 that{'if the deer are close to the    
{road fence it is going to rain'}and   
 this often proves to be true......    
   The wooden field gates on the       
 Yeatman estate are unmistakable being 
 white,five-barred with a full         
 depth,black Y in the centre.          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
