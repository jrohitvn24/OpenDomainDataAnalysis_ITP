		<content> CHRISTIAN MALFORD HAS NOT GOT VERY    
 MANY THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO IN IT.IT  
 HAS GOT A REC WHERE YOU CAN PLAY ON   
 THE SWINGS OR THE SLIDE OR YOU CAN    
 PLAY FOOTBALL.I WOULD LIKE A PROPER   
 B.M.X. TRACK WHERE I COULD RIDE ALONG 
 AND DO WHEELIES AND OTHER STUNTS .I   
 WOULD ALSO LIKE A SWIMMING POOL HERE  
 SO THAT I COULD GO SWIMMING WHEN EVER 
 I WANT INSTEAD OF ONLY GOING TO       
 WOOTTON BASSETT ON FRIDAY.I WISH THERE
 WAS A TENNIS COURT AND ACINEMA THEN   
 THERE WOULD BE LOTS OF THINGS TO DO   
 HERE.
