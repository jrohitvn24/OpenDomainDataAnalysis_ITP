		<title>13Festivals in Culcheth</title>
		<content>    Culcheth Carnival takes place every
 July. Different groups floats which   
 are driven in procession around       
 Culcheth before being judged.         
    This year our school, Newchurch    
 C.P., entered a float called          
 "Storyland". Children dressed up as   
 characters out of nursery rhymes and  
 books. We won first prize (Â£25).      
    Each year there is a bonfire on    
 Shaw Street playing fields. It usually
 has a "guy" on top of it. In the weeks
 before November 5th you can buy       
 treacle toffee and fireworks at nearby
 shops. On the night of the bonfire you
 can buy toffee apples, black peas,    
 soup and drinks. The Carnival and the 
 Bonfire are organised by Culcheth     
 Lions Club.                           
    At Christmas there is usually a    
 Christmas tree on the village green.  
 People sing carols around the tree.   </content>
