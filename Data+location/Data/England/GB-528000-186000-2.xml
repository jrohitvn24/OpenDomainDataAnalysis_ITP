		<content> We've  interviewed two schools,one a  
private school,the other a state       
school.                                
  PRIVATE SCHOOL.                      
 We interviewed the senior master from 
Highgate Boys'School.He enjoyed        
teaching in the private sector and has 
never taught in a state school.He      
regrets never teaching in a state      
school and thinks that teachers should 
rotate through both systems.           
 The numbers of pupils attending the   
school from different ethnic groups is 
noticeably low.The master pointed out  
that they were neither encouraged or   
discouraged.                           
 There are 600 pupils in the senior    
school,they are divided into 5 forms   
per year and these classes have an     
average of 26 pupils.The class numbers 
vary from subject to subject.The pupils
are streamed in ability from A-E.Class </content>
