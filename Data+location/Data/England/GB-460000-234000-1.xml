 The block of which the village of     
 Westbury forms the centre lies on     
 either slope of the valley of the     
 River Great Ouse.Gradients are gentle,
 the highest point on the block being  
 120 metres A.S.L. and the lowest 90   
 metres in the valley of the  Ouse.    
 Since the underlying rock is          
 limestone, there is only surface      
 drainage where either drift deposits  
 of clay have made the rock impervious 
 or where the water table is close to  
 the surface.Westbury itself nestles in
 a slight hollow on the south facing   
 north slope of the Ouse valley and    
 from a distance is almost invisible   
 among the patchwork of fields and the 
 tall deciduous trees which separate   
 them.                                 </content>
