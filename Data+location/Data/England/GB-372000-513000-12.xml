		<title>12The Army Training Centre</title>
		<content>  The army training centre is on the   
 outskirts of Warcop. It is used by    
 different regiments to train soldiers 
 in using small arms, tanks and        
 artillery. Sometimes it can get very  
 noisy and the school shakes when the  
 larger guns are fired. But you soon   
 get used to it. Our D-block has part  
 of the firing range on it. The centre 
 takes up to 600 soldiers.             
  The army want to buy another part of 
 the fell to use as a training ground, 
 but some people are organizing a      
 protest committee to try and stop     
 them. They say that the army will     
 spoil the countryside. But the centre 
 provides some work for people in      
 Warcop,and the soldiers spend a lot of
 money in the shops and the pub.       
  The army also own some of the        
 farmland, and let farmers use it.
