Hawbush Community Gardens, Bull Street, BrierleyHill. The Former Hawbush Urban Farm, next to Hawbush PrimarySchool, had turned into a paradise for drug taking and dealing. The ground was overgrown and the building broken into and become the place for used needles and broken bottles.&lt;br />&lt;br />Local residents have taken ownership of the site and transformed it into growing spaces for reisdents and the main building has come back to life, hosting a youthclub on Friday evenings and dance classes during the week. Many freeevents are put on throughout the year which are well received by the local youths.&lt;br />&lt;br />The biggest issue now is to keep the funds coming in to give the local residents more options and say in what happens on site.   &lt;br />
