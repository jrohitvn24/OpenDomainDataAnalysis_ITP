		<title>15The Old Clergy House</title>
		<content> The Old Clergy House,Alfriston is     
 described as a 'living museum'. Its   
 only exhibit is a history of the      
 building. It is one of a number of    
 timber framed buildings in the area   
 but unlike others there have been few 
 alterations to its structure.         
                                       
 Inside the Old Clergy House you       
 can see what the house was like when  
 it was constructed. One part of the   
 wattle and daub has been exposed to   
 show how the house was made.          
                                       
 The house was built in 1350. Although 
 called the Clergy House it was rented 
 out by the church to tenants. It was  
 the first property bought by the      
 National Trust,in 1896,and today about
 28,000 people visit it each year of   
 which 45% are National Trust members.
