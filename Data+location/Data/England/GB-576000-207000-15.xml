		<title>15LITTLE BADDOW CANAL-2</title>
		<content>   After 1975 the Chelmer and          
 Blackwater Company of Proprietors took
 over the canal for the purpose of     
 tourism. A pleasure cruiser was the   
 first boat acquired for public use and
 since then many pleasure cruisers and 
 small power boats can be found along  
 the canal. There are sufficient       
 facilities for the mooring of extra   
 boats. During the summer months the   
 public can hire a boat for one day or 
 a period of weeks and enjoy a trip    
 travelling through the beautiful Essex
 countryside.                          
   The section of the Navigation which 
 runs through Little Baddow is to the  
 north of the village and stretches    
 over an area of 4-5km. In this section
 is one lock, Paper Mill Lock. It was  
 the site of two mills and the barge   
 horse stables have recently been      
 restored to their working state.      </content>
