		<content> Nowadays, Class 50's and 33's go      
 through the tunnel and over the       
 viaduct.Sometimes a 125 - or H.S.T    
 comes through Gillingham because of   
 track work on the main line.Class 47's
 pull fertiliser trains and twice a day
 a ballast train comes through.In the  
 signal box is a board which lights up 
 when a train is coming.The paper train
 stops at 01.00hrs.Gillinghams earliest
 passenger train is at 04.20 and has   
 about 9 carriages, while the latest is
 at 10.30.Sometimes a special excursion
 train comes in at midnight. In about  
 1950 the track was changed to single  
 track and is still so today. It is    
 only a double track through the       
 station. Sometimes a deisel multiple  
 unit comes through, to the delight of 
 the many keen train spotters.
