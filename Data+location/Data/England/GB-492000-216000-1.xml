between 5 and 12.Opposite the school   
is the green.Mainly for little ones.   
There are swings and a slide and 2     
climing frames.Some way out from the   
village there is a church and an       
orchard.The church is old and a bit    
unstable,and it is a good walk from the
village to the church.There are lots of
different things like apples and plums 
in the orchard. cheddington is great   
if you like the country but if you dont

growing fast and they are building more
houses.
