 Many of these houses are now owner    
 occupied.The other post war building  
 is mostly of a higher income group,   
 many of the houses being detached.    
 There is little building going on now,
 some large properties have been       
 demolished(e.g. one at present in     
 Marsh Lane)and have been replaced by  
 new properties.
