		<content>    Most of the recreational sports in 
 the area are tied in with the tourist 
 industry. Some of the privately owned 
 woods have been made more profitable  
 by using them as game-sport areas.    
 The owners rear pheasants &amp; release   
 them on to their land charging people 
 to come &amp; shoot. At the end of the day
 the pheasants are often not kept by   
 the "guns" but are sold to wholesalers
 &amp; by them to London hotels. A days    
 shooting can cost up to Â£300.         
   It is also a good area for migrating
 Woodcock which are shot as they fly   
 over.                                 
   On the River Wye there is salmon    
 fishing, &amp; coarse fishing on the Lugg 
   Another pastime on the river is     
 canoeing -  near the new river bridge 
 just outside Mordiford. Horse riding  
 is also popular in the surrounding    
 area.                                 </content>
