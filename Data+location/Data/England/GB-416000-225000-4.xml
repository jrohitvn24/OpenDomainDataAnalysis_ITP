		<title>04DONNINGTON BREWERY</title>
		<content> Donnington Brewery is a small{brewery 
 in a beautiful valley about 3km from  
 Stow. There has been a{mill}on the    
 site for 900 years and the water wheel
 is still used to pump water. The      
 Brewery has been there for 120 years. 
 The{quality of Donnington Ale}is due  
 to the{fresh spring water }called     
 liquor by the brewer. Most of the beer
 is put into barrels and sold in the 17
 Inns belonging to the Brewery.        
 Donnington's products are recognised  
 by{CAMRA}as a genuine British quality 
 beer. The{Mill Pond}has become home   
 for many species of{waterfowl}which   
 all adds to the charm of this site.
