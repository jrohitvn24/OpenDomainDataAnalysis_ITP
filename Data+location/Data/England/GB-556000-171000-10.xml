		<title>10Darenth Woods, A Resource</title>
		<content>   Both our Primary schools use Darenth
 Woods as an educational resource.  We 
 go to Darenth Woods about once a month
 with our class.  We saw some men      
 coppicing the trees.  If they didn't  
 do this the trees would get too heavy 
 and the trunks would split.  One man  
 saws with a chain saw while the other 
 man pushes with a stick.  They put the
 wood into piles then a tractor comes  
 and takes it to the paper mills.  The 
 main type of tree to be coppiced is   
 the hornbeam.  Because coppicing lets 
 a lot of light reach the woodland     
 floor the wood has many kinds of wild 
 flowers including types of orchids.   
 Blue Circle own the mineral rights of 
 the woods and we are afraid that one  
 day they will dig up the woods to     
 quarry the chalk underneath.  Our     
 school has adopted part of the woods  
 to help protect them.                 </content>
