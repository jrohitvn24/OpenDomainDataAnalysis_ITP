		<title>12Industry, Local Cotton Mills</title>
		<content>   There are lots of mills in          
 Hollinwood. The mills were built for  
 cotton spinning. Most of them were    
 built about a century ago. There are  
 no mills still spinning cotton in     
 Hollinwood today. Devon Mill was built
 in 1908. It has four floors and a     
 ground floor. A mail-order compay     
 moved in over ten years ago. Devon    
 Mill is like a big shop They don't    
 make things. They pack them and send  
 them all over the country. The jobs   
 that people do in the mill are office 
 work, packing, checking and cleaning. 
 In Brook Mill the Trendsetter Quilt   
 Company occupy the top three floors.  
 They make sleeping bags, pillows and  
 quilts. There are five floors and a   
 basement in the mill. Around eighty   
 people work there. The jobs people do 
 are sewing, trimming, inspection,     
 packing and despatch.                 </content>
