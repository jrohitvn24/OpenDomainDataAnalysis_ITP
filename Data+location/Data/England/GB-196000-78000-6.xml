		<title>06The Farmer's Day</title>
		<content>  The farmer gets up early at 4.30am to
 milk the cows.At the finish of the    
 milking the farmer feeds the cows with
 silage,barley,maize and molasses.The  
 baby calves are then fed on a  milk   
 replacer.The farmer then goes to the{ 
 mill to prepare food for the following
 day.In late winter and early spring   
 ploughing and tilling are done. Spring
 is a very busy time on the farm.The   
 ewes usually lamb during March and    
 April and the shepherd has to be there
 to help any ewe who cannot have her   
 lamb without some help.During late    
 Spring and the early summer months    
 the first cut of silage is made.      
 Silage is  grass which is  cut and    
 stored and is fed to animals during   
 the winter months.Silage can be made  
 even if the weather is wet. Then he   
 checks his stock.
