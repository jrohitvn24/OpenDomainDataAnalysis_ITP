		<title>19TONBRIDGE FOOTBALL CLUB</title>
		<content>  Tonbridge Football Club was formed in
 1948 and soon became known as The     
 Angels.They originally played on a    
 ground which has now been redeveloped 
 as a shopping complex.                
  Their new ground,Longmead Stadium,was
 provided by the local council in 1980.
 There is no seating accommodation and 
 the ground can hold 5000 supporters.It
 costs Â£1 to go to a match and 50p for 
 old people and children.The average   
 gate is about 350.                    
  They play in the Southern District of
 the Southern League,against towns inc-
 luding Hastings,Crawley,Canterbury,   
 Folkestone,Ashford and Gravesend.In a 
 normal year the team plays 21 games.  
  The club is hoping to start a youth  
 side in the future,but at present they
 need more sponsorship,and are hoping  
 that local football will attract more 
 families,as spectators.               </content>
