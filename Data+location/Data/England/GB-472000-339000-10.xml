 any commplaints, about the roads or   
 any services, the Chairman gets on to 
 Rushcliffe or Nottinghamshire, and    
 they will see to it.The Whatton parish
 council has seven members. The        
 councillors don't have much power,    
 they set a rate extra to the general  
 rate.The parish of Scarrington has a  
 population of less than a hundred. The
 parish council is responsible for all 
 the small jobs in the villages;       
 keeping them tidy, controling stray   
 dogs and generally handling all       
 complaints.                           </content>
