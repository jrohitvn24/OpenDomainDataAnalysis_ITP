		<title>13Gala Activities</title>
		<content>    Before the Gala starts flags and   
 floats are made to get ready for the  
 big day. People rush about searching  
 for material and cardboard to make all
 sorts of costumes.                    
    It is a happy day. After dinner we 
 all get dressed up. Now it is time    
 for the Gala Queen to mount her float.
 Her dress is a clear,white colour. Her
 little attendants sit on boxes with   
 flowers all around them.              
    The Fancy Dress judging takes place
 next.All is quiet as the different    
 age groups are judged seperately. Then
 we parade down though the village     
 behind the band to the field where we 
 are told who the winners are.         
    Next come the races like egg and   
 spoon,running and the wheelbarrow.    
 There are plenty more activities to   
 keep people occupied. At the end of   
 the afternoon is the Fell Race.       </content>
