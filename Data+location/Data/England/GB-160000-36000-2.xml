		<content> Deverall Farm,covering 140 acres, is  
 one of the largest farms in the       
 area.It is a family concern employing 
 3 full-time staff and 2-3 casual      
 labourers most of the year round.The  
 land is divided between horticultural 
 crops,silage,and grazing for beef and 
 dairy herds.There are 80 head of      
 cattle,30 of which are for beef,the   
 rest for milking.The land is farmed on
 a 3 year rotation system: potatoes,   
 cabbage and brocilli are grown for    
 2 years followed by corn in the 3rd   
 year.For the next 3 years grass is    
 grown for grazing and cutting for     
 silage for winter fodder for the      
 cattle.Much of the horticultural      
 produce is packed and sent to markets 
 out of Cornwall.Although the farm is  
 completely mechanised for management  
 of the land and milking,the farmer    
 works very long hours in the summer.  </content>
