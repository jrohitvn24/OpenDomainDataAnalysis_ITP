{Beacon Fell Country Park/Barns Fold   
 The twelve square kilometres consist  
 chiefly of intensively managed        
 grassland used for the rearing of beef
 and dairy cattle and sheep. There are 
 a few pigs and poultry are kept for   
 domestic use. This is a sparsely      
 populated area and many of those who  
 live here work outside the block.     
 Because it is very picturesque        
 (verdant, rolling countryside         
 intersected by hedgerows,sandstone    
 walls and streams and dotted with     
 small copses and ponds), it attracts  
 many tourists throughout the year.    
 Parts of the area are used for        
 recreational purposes and of these the
 most significant is Beacon Fell       
 Country Park at the extreme west of   
 the block.
