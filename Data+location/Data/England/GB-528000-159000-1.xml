		<title>01Coulsdon and Purley</title>
		<content>   Coulsdon and Purley are two small   
 adjacent towns just south of Croydon  
 and situated on the northern edge of  
 the North Downs with an excellent     
 train service to London and the South 
 Coast.                                
   Coulsdon is near the new M25 London 
 Orbital Motorway and traffic is very  
 heavy.                                
   Purley is positioned where the roads
 from Brighton and Eastbourne meet. It 
 is a very busy road junction. As the  
 volume of traffic has increased the   
 roads have been widened, creating     
 segregated shopping areas.            
   Both Coulsdon and Purley are mainly 
 residential with a wide range of      
 houses ranging from those with half an
 acre of land in parts of Purley to    
 more modest semi-detached houses and  
 flats. There are large areas of open  
 space, used chiefly as golf courses.  </content>
