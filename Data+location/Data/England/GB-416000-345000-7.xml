		<title>07Ashbourne Choir Boy</title>
		<content>  At{St Oswalds Church}I am in the     
 choir.The choir master is Mr C Daly   
 Atkinson.We sing at services. We      
 practise every Tuesday and Thursday   
 and I go to two services every Sunday 
 and have practices after except for   
 the last Sunday in the month.We sing  
 anthems from{Mendelssohn,Bach,and     
{Tchaikovsky}and lots more composers.My
 three favourite anthems are The Lord  
 is My Shepherd,Like as the Heart      
 Desireth the Water Brooks,and He      
 Trusted in God.I always ask my mum if 
 I can go early so we can play{tick a  
{nick or hide and seek}and other games.
 We never get caught by the choir      
 master.In the sermon we talk and tell 
 jokes and eat sweets.We also perform  
 at{weddings and hospitals.}We sing to 
 the old.We sing at late night         
 Christmas shopping. We have been to   
{Derby Cathedral}and hope to go again. </content>
