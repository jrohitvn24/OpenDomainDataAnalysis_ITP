		<title>13Staining Mill          Staff</title>
		<content>There has been a mill in the village of
Staining for approximately 300 years.  
The present mill is about 160 years    
old. It used to mill local wheat and   
barley but was last used in the 1920s. 
The building was then used as a factory
producing ready mixed products for the 
catering industry. In 1980 it was      
converted to a house. At present the   
cap has been renewed and is able to    
move round. By the end of the year it  
is hoped that sails will be restored to
the building. The wind shaft is already
in place.                              
In 1880 a pedlar was murdered at the   
mill. With his blood he wrote the word 
"Jenny" on the wall outside. This was  
retained for many years since the      
miller's wife thought that ill luck    
would befall them if it were removed.  
Two people are known to have fallen to 
their deaths from the top.             </content>
