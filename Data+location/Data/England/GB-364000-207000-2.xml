		<content>   The Forest of Dean (Dean meaning    
 'wooded valley') is a place of        
 contrasts; a beautiful area in general
 but it also has some ugliness. It was 
 and is a working forest and many scars
 of former industries have been left.  
 From the roadside broadleaf trees     
 remain but in far fewer numbers than a
 century ago. Further into the forest, 
 conifers have taken their place,      
 densely covering the ground so that   
 little else grows. Bracken (or fern)  
 grows everywhere covering, in the     
 summer months, rubbish left in the    
 woodland and sheep roam at will,      
 adding to the forest's pleasantness   
 but causing danger and unsightliness  
 to roads and footpaths. The area has  
 always experienced hard times, no less
 true today with the highest           
 unemployment rate in the County.
