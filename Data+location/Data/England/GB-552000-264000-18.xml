		<content> The intensive use of fertilisers,     
 pesticides and fungicides is linked to
 a number of factors: Hybrid strains of
 plants are less resistant to disease  
 and can only be grown satisfactorily  
 with application of chemicals. This   
 has an effect on the ecology.         
 Marketing of the crop is difficult;   
 many small local mills and processors 
 have closed down, and the farmer must 
 deal with larger more distant         
 companies. The same large companies   
 may insist on very high standards for 
 produce, which places more weight on  
 use of chemicals to produce crops of a
 high standard.  The large companies   
 that purchase farmers' produce are    
 often the same ones that sell the     
 chemicals. Small farmers may feel that
 much of their indepence has been      
 eroded by central government and multi
 national conglomerates.               </content>
