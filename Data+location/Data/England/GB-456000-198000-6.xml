		<content>Of the 14 mentioned in the Oxfordshire 
Hundreds as once surrounding the Green 
only 3 ponds remain. The first,although
it is 'on the Green' and hence common  
property,is known as the School Pond,  
being situated in front of the School- 
House. Certainly the pupils enjoy pond 
dipping though,fortunately the pond is 
well fenced on the school side.        
Unfortunately reed mace was introduced 
in the past and it has 'taken over' to 
such an extent that a major effort by a
conservation group has been necessary  
to clear the pond.                     
A second pond is across the Green from 
the School outside Durham Leys Farm.   
This is easily accessible but far from 
ornamental.                            
The third pond, smallest of the three, 
is on the property of College Farm and 
can be reached only by walking across  
the fields.                            </content>
