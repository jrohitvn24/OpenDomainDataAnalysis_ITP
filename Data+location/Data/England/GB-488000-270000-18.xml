 All Saints Church at Gt.Harrowden is  
600 years old and has many interesting 
features.It stands at the side of the  
main road and has four pinnacles on the
tower.                                 
 The church has a doom painting showing
Hell and Heaven.It was for people who  
couldn't read.At the back of the church
there are the Ten Commandments.In the  
vestry there is a bone hole where they 
put old bones dug up in the graveyard. 
 The church organ is 100 years old and 
has only half the footpedals it is     
supposed to have.Behind the altar are  
two brasses of William Harrowden,his   
wife and pets.In the church a huge     
curtain divides the church in two      
because the congregation has become    
smaller.
