SCOUTS.                                
We have only about eight Scouts in our 
troop.That is only just enough for one 
Patrol.Scouts do things like           
orienteering.Our Scout troop is from   
7.00pm to 9.00pm and is on a Thursday  
night.We have scouts in the Village    
hall and have to pay one pound fifty   
five a month.                          
    We have to learn a lot of knots    
like reef ,sheep bend,half hitch,hitch 
etc.                                   
   We have two Patrol tents and four   
leader tents.
