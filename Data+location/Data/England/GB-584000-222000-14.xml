		<content>{ECOLOGY.}Old footpaths cross all the  
 farmland.To make sure the farmers     
 don't plough them people walk them to 
 keep them open.In wild areas of       
 Coggeshall are some rare flowers, like
 early purple orchids, ox-lips and     
 cow-slips.Unfortunately people        
 sometimes destroy these plants.       
 Fortunately conservationists such as  
 the Coggeshall Society try to prevent 
 this.Water is polluted if rubbish is  
 thrown into it.Animals and plants can 
 then be killed.Farmers put chemicals  
 and fertilizers on their land.        
 Conservationists try to stop pollution
 going into the rivers and streams to  
 safeguard animals and plants.Stubble  
 burning after harvesting can cause    
 accidents and is very unpleasant.     
 Ripping out hedges causes erosion and 
 snow drifts.The climate is dry        
 and sunny but with cold east winds.   </content>
