		<title>03Longhorsley Area</title>
		<content> This is an area of undulating land in 
 mid-Nothumberland which gradually     
 rises towards the north-west. This    
 western area is predominantly rough   
 grazing but as the land becomes lower 
 it is used for more arable crops such 
 as linseed rape and cereals.          
 Longhorsley, a small rural village, is
 the largest settlement in the area.   
 Until recently it was primarily a     
 farming community but is becoming     
 increasingly used as a dormitory      
 village. There is a hamlet at Linden  
 Hall formerly a large country home,   
 now a four star hotel. The houses here
 are mainly used for estate or hotel   
 workers. The remaining settlements are
 isolated cottages or farms. The area  
 is bisected by the A697, the Morpeth  
 to Coldstream road, so that the quiet 
 Longhorsley village becomes very busy 
 with through traffic.                 </content>
