		<content> Tom Park, a blacksmith, bought the    
 premises in 1907. In the 1920's he    
 sold "Pratt's Petrol" in square ,2    
 gallon tins and owned his first car   
 which he used as a taxi in North      
 Stainley and Mickley. Then in the     
 1930's the first hand operated petrol 
 pump was fitted.                      
    In 1943 Tom began to do car repairs
 and his blacksmith trade deteriorated.
 Two years later he took his son-in    
 -law Bert Maddison into partnership   
 which ended in 1970 when Bert         
 died.Bill Stockhill and Jim Catford   
 bought the business and by 1979 they  
 had built a new workshop and added    
 petrol pumps and a forecourt.         
    At present they are Citroen service
 dealers but they will do general      
 repairs to all types of vehicles. They
 are open from 7.30 am until 6.00 pm.
