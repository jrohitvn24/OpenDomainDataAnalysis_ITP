		<title>12HOME LIFE IN THE EIGHTIES</title>
		<content> People here seem content with their   
 lives; they have either been born to  
 isolation or have deliberately chosen 
 it. There are great contrasts in life 
 styles. Old people at Batworthy buy a 
 little meat and bread, otherwise are  
 entirely self-sufficient for milk,eggs
 vegetables etc. The house is simply   
 furnished _ no carpets because rain   
 causes floods to pour through the     
 kitchen. If it does the occupants     
 continue normally, wearing gumboots. A
 solid-fuel Raeburn, piped water and   
 bath and electric light are the sole  
 concessions to the twentieth century. 
 By contrast, retired middle-class     
 people live in luxuriously furnished  
 houses, with modern fitted kitchens   
 and bathrooms. Electricity and oil    
 central heating are labour-saving but 
 expensive. Shopping for food is easy  
 by car in nearby Chagford.            </content>
