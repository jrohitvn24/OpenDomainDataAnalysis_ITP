		<content> This is now the largest boat -        
 building company of its sort in       
 Britain. Ten different sizes of luxury
 motor cruisers are built from 21ft. to
 50ft.long.  200 people are employed.  
 The hulls are hand-moulded using      
 brushes and rollers and everything    
 down to the instruments and carpets is
 fitted before a completed boat leaves 
 the premises.                         
 Materials and equipment (glass cloth, 
 resin, wood, engines and electrical   
 equipment) are bought from all over   
 the world. Craftsmen are trained at   
 the factory, and are usually recruited
 from the building and motor trades.   
 Each boat is built to order, and they 
 are sold in Britain and Europe,       
 particularly to the Mediterranean     
 countries.
