 There is  a farm behind our garden.   
 This is called Fullers farm. Mr.      
 Fuller has just retired so he moved   
 down the road and his son moved into  
 Mr. Fullers old house. .they also have
 put silos up for corn. They sold some 
 cows and they have always let my      
 brother and sister play in the field  
 behind my garden, when we were        
 building they let us tip the old      
 bricks and dirt in a field or on their
 farm. Sometimes when it has been      
 snowing we go in the field behind our 
 garden because there is a slope in it.
 There are lots of slurry pits so we   
 can't go too near the farm they are as
 deep as our house which is a bungalow.
