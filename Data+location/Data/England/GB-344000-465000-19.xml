		<title>19I'm new to Slyne-with- Hest</title>
		<content>This year I have moved into Slyne-with 
Hest.We live in three old cottages     
knocked into one.The middle one was    
the village reading room.The actual    
cottages date back to the 1700's but   
the outhouses we have date to about    
the 1500's.I personally like it in     
Slyne with Hest because it is peaceful 
and near the sea and the hills but it's
also near the town of Lancaster and the
M6 motorway.All my family like Slyne   
with Hest as there are lots of fields  
and lanes to walk down.Also I like bird
spotting and alot of birds come to the 
shore at Hest bank.I go to Slyne with  
Hest Church of England School.I like it
there.I have moved many times before   
but I really think I will enjoy living 
here in Slyne-with-Hest.
