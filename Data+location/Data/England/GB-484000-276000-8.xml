		<content>                                       
Mr Ireson moved into Beech Cottage in  
1947.Beech Cottage had a large         
beautiful garden.Mr Ireson realised his
house and garden were in danger in     
1960.He found out from paper and radio 
issues.Tanners Lane needed to be       
redirected to act as a service road for
 the new shopping centre.After many    
talks Mr Ireson  talks managed to      
persuade the council that they did not 
need the land on which the cottage     
stood,but the garden had to go.On July 
2nd 1974 the demolision began.Mr.Ireson
was cross that a beautiful garden of an
English cottage should be destroyed for
the sake of modern development.Today   
Beech Cottage stands as a symbol of    
Kettering's past.The garden has been   
reduced to a small triangular patch of 
flowers,but Mr.Ireson would never wish 
to leave.                              </content>
