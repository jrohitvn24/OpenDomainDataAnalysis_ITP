		<content> All property in this area, old or new,
 has electricity.Gownfold Farm and some
 of the new Hawkhurst Court houses have
 Calor Gas tanks, and Bulchin's has a  
 Calor Gas Aga for cooking.Many of the 
 private houses have oil central       
 heating. At Shipbourne cottage,       
 Marshall's farmhouse and Lowfold,     
 cooking is by oil Agas, but Gownfold  
 and Buckfold farms have solid fuel    
 Raeburn stoves. For heating, open wood
 fires have become popular, part of the
 1980's nostalgia for past comforts as 
 a reaction against the bleak clinical 
 efficiency of electric fires. Buckfold
 Farm has an enclosed free-standing    
 wood-burning stove in the sitting room
 that stays alight all night. For this 
 fire the farmer buys a standing tree  
 from the estate woodman, felling it   
 and logging it himself. Drainage is   
 either by septic tank or cesspool.    </content>
