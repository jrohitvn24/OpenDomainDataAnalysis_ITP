		<content> I get to school by minibus. We play in
 the playground until the Deputy Head  
 claps . It's my job with 3 friends to 
 take class 3 in. We do this duty every
 playtime and at lunch if it is wet.I  
 do not like school dinners so I take a
 packed lunch. The lessons we have are 
 O.K. I like maths and handwriting.    
 Language is a bit boring sometimes.   
 Another teacher takes us for netball  
 and a retired man takes the boys for  
 football. I am the reserve for the 'A'
 team netball.                         
 Every term we do projects. Last term's
 project was minibeasts and we made    
 some large models of some of them.    
 This term's projects are The Middle   
 Ages and the Domesday Survey.         
 Other lessons are music,P.E.,         
 art/craft. We watch one or two        
 schools' T.V. programmes.
