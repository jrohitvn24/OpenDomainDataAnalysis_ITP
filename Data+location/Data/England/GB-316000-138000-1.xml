		<content> The Nether Stowey area is one of      
 outstanding natural beauty. Part of it
 is the eastern slopes of the Quantock 
 Hills, descending into the lower      
 grazing and farming areas. To the     
 east, is the village of Nether Stowey,
 situated at the foot of the Castle    
 Mount and adjacent to the main A39    
 Bridgwater to Minehead road. Included 
 in this area is the smaller village of
 Over Stowey with its own church, and  
 passed by the road to Taunton. On the 
 other side of the A39 towards the     
 coast we find Dodington, a cluster of 
 homes within a farming community, but 
 once an active copper mining centre in
 the 18th century.
