		<content> The tradition of having a Fairfield   
 Carnival was revived in 1984.         
 In{1985}the Carnival was held on      
 Saturday, 15th. June. Julie Swift was 
 the 1985 Carnival Queen. Many Carnival
 Queens from surrounding towns and     
 villages attended. Not only did Julie 
 Swift's family celebrate her becoming 
 Carnival Queen - the whole of her road
 was decorated with paper flowers. The 
 grounds of Fairfield Infant School    
 were used for the Carnival. Hundreds  
 of people crowded the streets to watch
 the procession pass by. There was a   
 troupe of dancers, Fairfield band     
 played and many people wore fancy     
 dress. People walked with the         
 procession collecting money for       
 charity. Nicola Pimblett, Robert Kirk,
 and Charlotte Lacy won prizes in an   
 art competition. It all finished at   
 five o'clock.                         </content>
