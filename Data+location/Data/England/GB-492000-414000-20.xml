		<title>20THE LIFE OF A PENSIONER</title>
		<content>    It is July 1985 and I live in      
 Appleby in the old aged pensioner     
 bungalows on Paul Lane. There are no  
 shops or a post office but we have two
 post boxes. I have to go to{Scunthorpe
 to collect my pension from the post   
 office there and I go to{Winterton}to}
 the clinic if I want to see a doctor. 
 The buses run through the village four
 times a day and I have a pass which   
 enables me to travel to Scunthorpe for
 40p.                                  
    The{milkman}brings our milk four   
 times a week, whilst the{butcher}calls
 twice a week and a{fish van}and{fruit 
{van}once a week. My day starts at     
 about eight in the morning when I do  
 my housework and gardening. I go to   
 the over 60's club once a month where 
 we play whist or bingo and have a cup 
 of tea. I go to church at St          
 Bartholomews in Appleby.              </content>
