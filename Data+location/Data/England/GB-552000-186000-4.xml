		<title>04A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content>      I wake up at 7.30am and get up 5 
 minutes later.   I wash and put on my 
 school uniform.   I then go downstairs
 for my breakfast.   When I am ready  I
 make sure I have everything.   I get  
 into my car while my friends are      
 walking or are on the bus.   I arrive 
 at about 8.40am.   We wait until      
 9.00am to go into school.             
      We have various lessons for about
 an hour and a half.   We have a break 
 of a quarter of an hour.   After break
 we have another hours lessons.   Then 
 it is lunchtime from 12.00 to 1.20pm. 
 Although school dinners are provided  
 most people have packed lunch.   We   
 then go back to class for more        
 lessons.   At 2.20pm we have last     
 break.   At 3.30pm everyone goes home.
 When I get home I change, watch       
 television, have tea and go to bed at 
 9.00pm.                               </content>
