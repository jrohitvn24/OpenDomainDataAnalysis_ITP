		<title>07Village Shop</title>
		<content> Peldon has only one village shop which
 supplies the villagers with many of   
 their needs. This is essential as     
 Colchester is some 10 miles away, and 
 though there is a bus service, it is  
 not frequent.                         
 The shop sells fresh bread and        
 vegetables, many grown locally. There 
 is also an extensive range of         
 hardware such as nails, screws        
 and glues etc, as well as tools and   
 equipment.                            
 As with many such village shops, it is
 a family concern and forms a large    
 part of village life besides the      
 church and the Plough Inn.            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
