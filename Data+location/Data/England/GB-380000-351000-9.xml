		<title>09St Martin's Church Talke</title>
		<content>  Saint Martin's Church is not a very  
old church.My school had their harvest 
festival service there and my Auntie   
is buried there.The church is built    
out of stones and brick,with a short   
brick tower.Inside the church,as you go
in through a door at the west end where
the tower is,there is a staircase going
up to the balcony and two big cupboards
which have hymn books in them.Then,if  
you keep on walking,you go between the 
wooden pews in the aisle.To your left  
there is a piano and some chairs,there 
is an organ as well.Then there is the  
altar,at the east end of the church,   
with a carved wooden figure on each    
side.There are windows decorated       
with coloured glass,one is about a     
mining disaster that happened in Talke 
a long time ago.Behind the church      
there is a large,overgrown graveyard,  
which is still used for burials.       </content>
