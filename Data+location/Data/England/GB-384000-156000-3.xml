		<content> In our area there are three schools,  
 two primary, one comprhensive and also
 one technical college. Children start 
 school at four and a half years old   
 and stay at primary school until they 
 are eleven and then go to             
 comprehensive school until they are   
 sixteen at least. School starts at    
 approximately 9.00am and finishes     
 between 3.00 and 4.00pm. We also have 
 breaks in between. Clarendon          
 Comprehensive School has 12 classes of
 children going there every year. Each 
 class of children comes from a        
 different primary school. We take lots
 of lessons such as Maths, English,    
 Art, Science, P.E. etc. Children at   
 school either stay for school dinners,
 go home for dinner or take a packed   
 lunch to school.
