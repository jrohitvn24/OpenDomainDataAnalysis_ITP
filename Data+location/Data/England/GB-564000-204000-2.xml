		<title>02WRITTLE, ALL SAINTS CHURCH</title>
		<content> All Saints Church is situated just    
 off Writtle Green. It is surrounded   
 by the graveyard and the garden of    
 rest. There are also a number of yew  
 trees surrounding the church.         
      The first part of the church     
 dates from the twelfth century but it 
 has been frequently added to and      
 altered since then.                   
       In 1974 there was a fire at the 
 church which extensively damaged the  
 roof. A cross was made from the burnt 
 timbers and it still stands in the    
 church yard today.                    
        There are quite a few stained  
 glass windows in the church but       
 sometimes people break them with      
 stones and they are replaced with     
 plain glass. The church has a choir   
 and the name of the vicar is Peter    
 Mason.
