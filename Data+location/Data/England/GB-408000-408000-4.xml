		<title>04Employment in Meltham</title>
		<content> In Meltham there are about 7000       
 people.The largest employer is{Case   
{Tractors}who for many years have had  
 beteen 40% and 50% of its employees   
 living in the{Meltham}area.Recently   
 the sale of tractors has slumped owing
 to the world recession and hundreds of
 people have lost their jobs over the  
 last two years.There are rumours that 
 the firm may close altogether in 1987 
 which obviously will have a serious   
 effect on the town.The next largest   
 source of employment is that of the   
{service sector}in shops, doctors,     
 garages etc.The main shopping area    
 is in the centre of the village.Of    
 those people who travel outside of    
 Meltham over half of them travel to   
 nearby Huddersfield.The remainder     
 travel to the many large towns and    
 cities around{Meltham,}such as        
 Leeds,Bradford,Halifax and Batley.    </content>
