		<title>15THE ISIS FISH FARM</title>
		<content>                                       
The fish farm is on the Evenlode at the
site of the old Eynsham water mill at  
GR 438108. The mill has been converted 
into a luxurious dwelling house, and   
the river has been diverted through    
special concrete tanks.                
                                       
The fish grown here are all rainbow    
trout which is a good but cheaper      
substitute for salmon. The farm handles
about 1 million fish a year. The fish  
are bought in at 3 oz and kept in small
round ponds with 11,000 fish in each.  
When they have grown to 12 oz they are 
put into larger pools, and are again   
graded by size. They are carefully fed 
with pellets of herring meal, with     
bigger pellets for bigger fish. The    
farm uses 50 tons of fish food each    
year. They lose a lot of fish which    
jump out or are caught by heron.       </content>
