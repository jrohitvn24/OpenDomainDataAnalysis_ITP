		<content> They put drains and dykes there to    
 take water away to the river. A land  
 drain is a pipe that runs underground 
 in a field and goes to a dyke which   
 will then run to a river. There is a  
 house drain which runs into the sewers
 which gets treated and goes to a dyke 
 and runs to the river. In the house   
 drain it runs to the manhole , then to
 the sewers. The land drains start     
 about eighteen inches under the ground
 to take the surface water and go into 
 the dyke about three feet under the   
 ground. The main job of a drain is to 
 take all the rain water and waste     
 water to the dyke.
