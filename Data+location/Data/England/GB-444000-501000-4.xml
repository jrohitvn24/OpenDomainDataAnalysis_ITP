		<content>{Swainby}has no large-scale develop-   
 ment, the two small housing estates   
 being discreetly sited behind and west
 of the main street.National Park rules
 apply to design and materials used in 
 the Conservation Area but there are   
 some inconsistencies. Of the 6 Council
 Houses,4 have been sold to the tenants
 and there are 23 OAP bungalows with   
 resident warden. Most of the older    
 houses have been modernised, some     
 being originally miners' cottages     
 built when the ironstone mines were in
 production. In{Potto,}post-war houses 
 outnumber older ones. An estate of 13 
 houses was built in the 1960s, west of
 the main street, where there has been 
 infilling. Potto Hall, a Victorian    
 mansion, is now a hotel. There are 3  
 public houses in Swainby, 1 in Potto  
 and 2 in Trenholme.{Ingleby Arncliffe}
