		<title>03Calton and Hanlith</title>
		<content>{Calton}is about 1 mile out of Airton  
 up a very steep,very narrow,twisting  
 road.It is only a hamlet and has      
 approximately 10 occupied             
 houses,although more are being        
 developed,several from barn           
 conversions.                          
 Calton has no public amenities and is 
 not on any public transport           
 route.however,it must have been more  
 important once because of "Calton     
 Hall".                                
{Hanlith}is approximately 3/4 of a mile
 out of Kirkby Malham.However,the road 
 linking the 2 is very narrow and is   
 often impassible in Winter.           
 Hanlith consists of only 6 families,2 
 of whom farm.                         
 Hanlith has no public amenities at    
 all,although it does have a manor     
 house in Hanlith Hall.
