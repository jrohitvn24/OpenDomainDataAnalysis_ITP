		<title>09SHOPPING IN HELMSHORE.</title>
		<content> There are few shops in our area, but  
 they sell the main essentials, so you 
 don't need to go very far to get all  
 the things you want. The main shopping
 can be done in Manchester. It is quick
 and easy to get there, because of the 
 new M66 motorway.                     
                                       
 There is a shop which is not really a 
 grocers because it sells cakes and    
 vegetables and it also sells sweets   
 and frozen goods. There is a shop     
 that sells videos, food, drinks etc.  
 At a hardwear shop they sell bikes,   
 D.I.Y. materials, a few garden tools, 
 toys, watches, wallpaper and suchlike.
 There is a D.I.Y.shop,which is also a 
 builders merchants and it sells       
 bricks, cement, slate, wood, sheds and
 tools.
