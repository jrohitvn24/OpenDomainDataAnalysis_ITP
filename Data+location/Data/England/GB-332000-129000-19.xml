		<content> There are two rivers in our section   
 and they meet near Walkey farm at     
 Burrowbridge. The river{Tone}which    
 flows through Taunton meets the river 
{Parrett.}The banks have to be very    
 high on the river Parrett because it  
 is a tidal river. Two years ago the   
 banks of the river Parrett had        
 weakened and it tumbled down          
 because it was too low. They are still
 repairing it. They are hoping to build
 a wall so that there can be a proper  
 road beside the river. There are      
{pumping stations}to drain the water   
 from the fields into the river. They  
 pump the water into the river at low  
 tide but when it is high they close   
 the sluice gates to prevent the water 
 from flooding the moors.              
 The bridge at Burrowbridge is the last
 place you can cross the river until   
 you reach the M5.                     </content>
