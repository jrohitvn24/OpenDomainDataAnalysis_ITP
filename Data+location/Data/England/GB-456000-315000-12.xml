		<content> Paudy Rise Farm is farmed by Mr. Crook
 and son. They own 350 acres, but farm 
 600 acres. They rented it from 1922   
 but started to buy it in 1959. They   
 work 8 hours a day, seven days a week,
 but at busy times like harvesttime, 7 
 a.m. to 10 p.m. They grow wheat,      
 barley, oats, winter wheat and grass. 
 They own 10 tractors, 1 Combine       
 Harvester, a seed drill, plough and   
 harrow. They find the plough most     
 useful. They own 30 suckler cows and  
 100 head of cattle - Fresian and      
 Hereford and 1 Angus bull. They use   
 Melton and Leicester Markets for beef 
 animals. They exported 80 tons of     
 barley to Poland. Many farmers in the 
 area sent 100 tons of wheat to the    
 people suffering in the Ethiopian     
 famine.
