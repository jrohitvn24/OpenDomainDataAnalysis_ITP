		<content> The population is mixed social classes
 &amp; changes little. Numbers do not vary 
 much as the Kent Structure Plan &amp;     
 Metropolitan Green Belt Policies      
 militate against new building in this 
 rural area. In 1984 the number of     
 electors on the Roll in the area of   
 the Hoath in this survey 139. If the  
 strip of Cowden to the west &amp; the     
 strip of Penshurst to the east are    
 included the number is about 200. Of  
 the Hoath electors there are about 42 
 retired people. 3 over retirement age 
 are still earning and 94 adults below 
 60 yrs. There are about 32 children   
 below 18 yrs. Of those below 60 yrs   
 some are working and some women at    
 home. The working population is       
 composed of about 16 going to London  
 and its environs and about 34 working 
 locally or in nearby towns.
