		<content> Taunton is a market town in the Vale  
 of Taunton Deane, serving a large     
 rural area.                           
  It has a population of around 38,000 
 and its principal income apart from   
 agriculture is tourism. Its position  
 makes it an ideal touring centre for  
 both coast and moorland.              
  It has a mainline railway station and
 is adjacent to the M5 motorway.       
  It has little in the way of industry 
 but its cattle market is one of the   
 largest in the South West,drawing     
 stock from a 50 mile radius.          
  Much redevelopment is going on in the
 town centre,which when completed will 
 provide the town with a major shopping
 area.
