		<content> The farmland around the village is    
 mixed, mostly sheep and a few cattle  
 eastwards to the forest; arable to the
 west and north. The eastern area of   
 the forest has the A1065 running      
 through it and belongs to the Forestry
 Commission. There is a picnic site,   
 Emily's Wood on the west side of the  
 road. The arable land in the west fin-
 ishes with a narrow strip of heathland
 part of a large reserve owned by the  
 Norfolk Nat. Trust, this being the    
 home in particular of the Stone Curlew
 and other scarce Breckland features.  
 It is wardened in the summer. The     
 whole block is in Breckland and for   
 further information on this and the   
 F.C. please refer to 05800285.
