		<title>08ALDERNEY HOSPITAL</title>
		<content>    The Hospital lies on the western   
 edge of the area. It specializes in   
 elderly people. Nurses go their homes 
 or they are taken care of in one of   
 the four wards available.             
    Alderney was built in 1888 and is  
 called Alderney because of a road of  
 that name nearby.                     
    There are 4 in-patient wards and 2 
 day wards. In each ward there are 28  
 beds. The total number of patients are
 97 in the in-patient wards and 35 in  
 the two day wards. There are 14 male  
 staff and 94 female staff. They also  
 have 4 community nurses taking care of
 50 patients each. Alderney also       
 employs part-time workers, catering in
 the main kitchen or nursing.          
    The Hospital covers three areas;   
 Poole, Wimborne and the Purbeck.
