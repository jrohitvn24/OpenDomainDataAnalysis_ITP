		<content> There is only one place of worship in 
 this block, this being Woodford       
 Methodist Church which is situated in 
 square 2113. The present building was 
 opened on 23rd March 1883. The cost of
 building the church was Â£300. There is
 a church service every Sunday with    
 additional services at the various    
 religious festivals i.e. Christmas and
 Easter. The average congregation has  
 decreased over the years with the     
 average congregation at the present   
 time being only 10-15. This number    
 rises at Christmas and Easter and also
 when the Sunday school holds its      
 anniversary services.                 
 The Sunday school is for children     
 between the ages of 3 and 11. The     
 numbers attending Sunday school has   
 also declined over the years with     
 there being 10 children on the roll at
 the present time.                     </content>
