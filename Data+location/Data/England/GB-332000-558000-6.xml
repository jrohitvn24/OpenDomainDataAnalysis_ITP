		<title>06Beaumont Church</title>
		<content>    Beaumont is a French word which    
 when translated means beautiful hill. 
 The Norman Church was built in 1296 on
 the site of a Roman Turret, some of   
 the Roman stones being used to build  
 the walls of the church.              
 Burgh-by-Sands and Beaumont were      
 uncomfortable places in which to live 
 because of the constant border        
 battles.                              
    Two traditions connected with Saint
 Mary's Church are at weddings when the
 church gates are tied up. When the    
 groom cuts the string it's supposed to
 bring good luck to the couple. Next,  
 a piece of rope across the road, and  
 the wedding cars can only pass if they
 give money to the children.           
    The vicar has five local parishes  
 and preaches in four churches and in  
 schools. The first vicar of St. Mary's
 was Sir Elias de Thirlwall.           </content>
