		<title>12DEANS PLACE HOTEL, ALFRISTON</title>
		<content> This hotel situated at the southern   
 end of Alfriston adjoins the Tye and  
 Clergy House, with the Cuckmere       
 meandering nearby.  The site is old,  
 first being documented as 'Dene' in   
 Tudor times, and was probably         
 associated with John de Dene of       
 Alfricchestone in 1355.  Evidence     
 exists that it was moated, and may    
 have had manor status, it being the   
 only site in Alfriston permitted a    
 dovecote.  In 1866 a 'pest house' was 
 situated at Deans Place 'Farm',       
 probably an outbuilding serving as an 
 isolation hospital.  During the       
 1914-18 War it was called 'Hydro', and
 following the 1939-45 War it was much 
 extended to become a busy hotel. Today
 under Michael and Janet Pritchard it  
 has 44 bedrooms with private bathrooms
 together with conference facilities   
 and attracts many walkers as guests.  </content>
