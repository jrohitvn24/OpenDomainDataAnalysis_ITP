		<title>11A Warton Family's Thoughts</title>
		<content>    We came from Worcestershire in     
1978 after a Lancashire holiday when   
we decided to live here. Being near the
M6, some lovely countryside and the    
Lakes has great appeal.                
    Warton is not a big village, is    
not overall an old village and has a   
comfortable "lived-in" feel. We are    
most happy here.                       
     We have been involved with school 
activities, including the School Assoc.
Our son attends the local school after 
his sisters who both enjoy being in the
church choir very much.  Again, both   
girls have been members of the Girl    
Guides, although only the middle child 
now attends.                           
    Warton has no "night" life except  
the local pubs and the occasional "do" 
at the Village Hall but it's a good    
place to live and bring up children.
