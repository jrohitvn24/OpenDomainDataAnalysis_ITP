		<title>20THE RIVERS</title>
		<content> THERE ARE TWO RIVERS IS OUR AREA, THE 
 RIVER RODEN AND THE RIVER TERN.       
 THE BRIDGE THAT CROSSES THE RIVER     
 RODEN IN RODINGTON IS EXACTLY 100     
 YEARS OLD THIS YEAR. IT REPLACED A    
 HORSE BRIDGE AND FORD. THE RIVER RODEN
 FLOWS FROM NORTH TO SOUTH OF OUR AREA.
 IT IS A SMALL RIVER, NOWHERE WIDER    
 THAN 8 METRES. IT FLOWS INTO THE RIVER
 TERN AT WALCOT MILL.  THERE IS NO     
 LONGER A WORKING MILL AT WALCOT, BUT  
 THE FIVE STOREY BUILDING STILL STANDS.
 THERE IS A WEIR WITH MACHINERY ON IT  
 TO CONTROL THE FLOW OF WATER. THERE   
 ARE 6 GATES ALTOGETHER BUT ONLY 4 ARE 
 IN USE EXCEPT IN TIME OF FLOOD. ANY   
 FLOOD WATER FLOWS INTO THE MILL POND. 
 THERE IS TROUT AND COURSE FISHING ON  
 THE RIVER TERN. THE FISHING RIGHTS AT 
 WALCOT BELONG TO THE BRITISH SUGAR    
 CORPORATION.                          
                                       </content>
