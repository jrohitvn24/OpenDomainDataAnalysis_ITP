		<content>   I nearly overslept this morning .I  
 forgot to set my alarm clock .By the  
 time I was dressed Daddy was outside  
 getting ready to milk the goats.I     
 found a biscuit and quickly pulled on 
 my boots.                             
   I helped Daddy with the milking and 
 then put the churn in the water bath  
 to cool.At 8.00 a.m. we came in for   
 breakfast and Mummy was already       
 cooking bacon and egg.As we finished  
 eating, the postman dropped the       
 letters through the front door.Soon   
 John arrived.He helps Daddy on        
 Saturdays. While Daddy put the milk   
 into cartons I put the clips on.My    
 brother had a ride in the Landrover   
 with John to the top of the hill to   
 check the cattle.We have forty cattle 
 grazing in the pasture up on the      
 Downs.They are all about twelve months
 old.                                  </content>
