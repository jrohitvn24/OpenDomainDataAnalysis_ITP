		<title>20LIFE IN 1985</title>
		<content> If you are reading this in 2085 then  
 we hope you have found all the        
 answers. In 1985 we are beset by      
 questions about unemployment, world   
 peace, resources, pollution and the   
 impact of new technology, such as the 
 machine I am using to do this, on all 
 of the above. The children who wrote  
 these pages face a future where the   
 accelerated rate of change in a wide  
 range of areas is leading to increased
 uncertainty. We do however still enjoy
 life in 1985, and we live in a part of
 England which is still very beautiful.
 We hope that in 2085 the beauty is    
 still there.
