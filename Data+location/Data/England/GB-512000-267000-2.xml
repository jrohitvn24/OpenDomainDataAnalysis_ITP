		<title>02Grafham, a changed community</title>
		<content>   Both settlements at{Grafham,}the    
 settlement by the grove, and          
{Perry,}pear tree orchards, are        
 mentioned  in the{Domesday Book.}The  
 Church at Perry no longer survives but
 there are still woodland and meadows  
 in the area.                          
   Only two moats remain of the once   
 important manor house of Grafham. The 
 disused railway running through the   
 north of the block bears witness to   
 the passing of another era.           
   However the creation of Grafham     
 Water brought the greatest change. In 
 a decade the centuries old quiet      
 farming area has become a major       
 tourist attraction for many miles     
 around. Under the watchful eye of the 
 Water Authority, County Planners and  
 Conservation Bodies, it has become a  
 recreational and ecological centre    
 attracting many thousands of visitors.</content>
