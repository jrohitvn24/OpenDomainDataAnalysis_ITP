		<title>07TRANSPORT-SCHOOL JOURNEY</title>
		<content>{ }The day starts,with me getting up   
 early enough to catch the school bus  
 at 8.20am. It takes me from Westbury  
 to Buckingham 5 miles away.Before     
 reaching us,the bus has called at     
 other small neighbouring villages     
 called Shalstone,Biddlesden and       
 Turweston.My part of the journey takes
 half an hour.The school day ends at   
 15.30 but my day isn't over yet.The   
 way home is about 23 miles and takes  
 one and a quarter hours.Although I am 
 last on in the morning,I and my other 
 school friends that live in Westbury, 
 are always home last at 16.45.Our bus 
 service is run by'Rainbows'a private  
 coach company,which is at the northern
 end of the village.I have travelled on
 this route for three years and still  
 have another six years to do.
