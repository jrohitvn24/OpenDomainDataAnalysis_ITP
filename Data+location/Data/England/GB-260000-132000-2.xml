		<title>02FARMING IN GOODLEIGH</title>
		<content> The average farms have about 100-150  
 acres and are mainly stock farms      
 speciaizing in sheep and cows.        
       Sheep are useful for breeding   
 lambs which are killed about 16 weeks 
 old for human consumption or kept on  
 the farm for future ewe replacements. 
 Sheep are also useful for their wool. 
       Most herds of cows are fed      
 silage during the winter which is made
 by chopping summer grass into small   
 lengths with a Forage Harvester and   
 ensiling it in large clamps and       
 leaving to fermemt until fed in the   
 winter.                               
       Rearing bull calves for beef    
 without castrating them is becoming   
 another popular system.This  method   
 is called bull beef. They eat simi    
 lar food to dairy cows such as        
 silage,hay                            
 and cereals.                          </content>
