		<title>03HOP GROWING IN PUTTENHAM</title>
		<content>{Puttenham}is the only place in Surrey 
 where hops are grown in 1985. They    
 have been growing here for 140 years  
 and there are still 4 hectares on the 
 Hampton Estates.  The chalk soil of   
 the south facing slope of the Hog's   
 Back is ideal though they grow too on 
 the clay and greensand.               
 They are expensive to grow because of 
 the labour needed for stringing,      
 training the vines, spraying and      
 harvesting. The hops are cut in       
 September, taken to the barn and put  
 on hooks. A machine strips the vines  
 and separates the leaves from the     
 flowers which are then dried at a     
 temperature of 60 degrees Celsius,    
 cooled on a wooden floor and pressed  
 into large bags. They are sent to     
 Ledbury, where they are sold to       
 breweries and used for flavouring     
 beer.                                 </content>
