		<content>                                       
  The Gala takes place on the first    
 Saturday in July.It is supported by   
 local{clubs.}Before the Gala begins   
 each separate club thinks of a theme  
 and decorates a lorry with it.Then    
 they form a convoy through the village
 to the field where the Gala is held.  
 There are lots of stalls some with    
 games,some with gifts to buy (books,  
 toys),some with food,drink,(hotdogs,  
 icecream,orange squash,lime juice).   
 During the day there are lots of      
{competitions}eg.flower arranging,the  
 most obedient dog,the best pets.There 
 are races for all ages,from babies to 
 pensioners.The pubs also compete      
 against each other.Last year they had 
 an obstacle course.
