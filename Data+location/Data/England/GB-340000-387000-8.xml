		<title>08MODERN HOUSING IN NETHERLEY</title>
		<content>{ Netherley}is a modern housing estate 
 built about fifteen years ago.It      
 contains some blocks of{flats,}rows of
{houses}and{maisonettes.}Most residents
 try to take a pride in their          
 environment but due to several factors
 parts of Netherley are already being  
 knocked down as slum clearance.       
{ Vandals}came around at night and     
 wrote names all over the walls,set    
 fire to rubbish and smashed windows.  
 Lifts in flats were continually       
 broken.                               
  Flats became flooded,damp and dirty. 
 They were{uninhabitable.}Some are in  
 the process of being{demolished}and   
 new houses may be built.              
  One eleven_year old resident writes  
{"Wherever you walk you see broken     
{windows.I think it is disgusting.The  
{field near my house gets used as a    
{rubbish dump and rats run over it".   </content>
