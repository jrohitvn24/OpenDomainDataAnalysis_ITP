		<content> In our block the farms are mostly     
 dairy farms. The main breeds of cattle
 are Friesians and Herefords. There are
 20 farms ranging in size from 30 to   
 500 acres. Nearly all of the land is  
 used for grazing or growing hay and   
 silage. The farms have between 30 and 
 200 cows which are milked in modern   
 parlours by machine. Milk is collected
 daily and taken by lorries to Alfreton
 creamery. 1985 has been a good year   
 because there was a lot of rain in the
 spring. The crops have grown very tall
 and the silage pits and hay barns are 
 very full. A few farmers grow barley  
 and potatoes. A number of the farms   
 are mixed and have sheep as well as   
 cattle. Most of them have up to 300   
 sheep and lambs. The farmers sell     
 lambs for meat at Bakewell market.    
 Wool is sold from the ewes and rams.
