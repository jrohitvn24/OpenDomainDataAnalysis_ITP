		<title>08Rousham Estate</title>
		<content> The estate of 1100 acres is the same  
 size now as it was in 1770. Like other
 estates in the area it grows cereal   
 crops (as encouraged by the EEC       
 farming policy), including wheat and  
 winter barley, as well as beans, rape 
 and, unusually, flax.                 
 The owner keeps beef cattle -         
 Herefords, Charolais and Friesians -  
 as well as his herd of long-horn      
 cattle, now rare in England, which    
 have been bred here since 1907.       
 There is a continuing programme of    
 tree planting, especially deciduous   
 trees, to replace those lost to elm   
 disease and recent storms.            
 A lake has been made to the west of   
 the Home Farm for reaons of           
 conservation.
