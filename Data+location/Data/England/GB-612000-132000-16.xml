		<content>{  Portex}is the largest factory in    
 Hythe, employing about 720 people. It 
 was built in 1964 and has been        
 expanding ever since. They make       
 plastic medical equipment for use in  
 hospitals, especially different kinds 
 of tubing. The tubes are used in      
 incubators to keep babies alive.      
 Others are used for giving            
 anaesthetics into the trachea; these  
 have a special inflatable cuff that   
 stops the gas escaping back up the    
 throat. Some are used to carry        
 blood and others to give injections.  
                                       
   Many heart operations like those for
 mending holes and bypassing blocked   
 arteries use plastic tubes from       
 Portex. They also make grommets that  
 are put in many childrens ears. Their 
 tubing is also used on animals in the 
 same ways.                            </content>
