		<title>15A Day in the Life of Karen</title>
		<content> On July 6th I got up at 8.00am and had
 my breakfast. Then at 9.00am we went  
 into Chichester. I bought myself a    
 pair of pink shoes to match my best   
 dress and my sister got a pair of     
 school sandals which my dad paid for. 
 After that we went to get an ice cream
 but the shop had run out, so we went  
 back 10 minutes later and had one.    
 Then we went to get some Pork Fillet  
 for dinner ,which we barbecued when we
 got home. We had srawberries and cream
 for pudding as it was my mum and dad's
 Wedding Anniversary. In the afternoon 
 Juile and I used some canes to make a 
 tent, a water carrier and a clothes   
 prop . At teatime we had corned beef  
 and choux buns . Then I went to bed at
 9.00pm.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
