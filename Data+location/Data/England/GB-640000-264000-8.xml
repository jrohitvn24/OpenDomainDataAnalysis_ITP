		<content> The area has no school, though        
 Theberton has a school building no    
 longer used as such. Small children   
 are taken by bus to the primary school
 at Middleton and Kelsale, older       
 children are taken by bus to the      
 middle school at Saxmundham and       
 Leiston, and at the age of 13 years to
 the High School in Leiston. Young     
 people at the high school have the    
 opportunity for a university education
 if they achieve the required standard.
