		<content>  We also conducted a questionaire in  
 the{Weeley}and{Weeley Heath}area. From
 this we were able to deduce the       
 following facts:                      
{22%}of the inhabitants have lived     
 there all their lives.                
{54%}of the inhabitants (not including 
 those who have lived there all their  
 lives) have lived there for ten years 
 or more.                              
{94%}of the inhabitants enjoy living   
 there for various reasons such as the 
 rural area, peaceful countryside and  
 privacy. Those who disliked it did so 
 because of poor availability of public
 transport or problems with stubble    
 burning or chemical sprays.           
{42%}of the inhabitants are retired    
 (this is reflected by the fact that{  
{76%}of the inhabitants have lived     
 there ten years or more).             
{8%}of inhabitants are unemployed.     </content>
