		<content>  We interviewed some people in the    
 village who went to N.Ferriby school  
 over 40 years ago.We compared their   
 answers to see how school has changed 
 from 1915 to now.                     
  N.Ferriby Primary school is on 3     
 sites,the Old school built in 1868,the
 Main school started in 1954 and the   
 New school built in 1971.The New      
 school houses 2 classes of reception  
 and 5+children,the Old school 2       
 classes of 6-7year olds and the Main  
 school 6 classes of juniors 7-11.In   
 1948 the school opened a canteen in   
 the village hall catering for 60      
 school dinners,nowadays only 27 stay, 
 but now children stay packed lunches, 
 prior to the war only children from   
 Melton or the High Rd.could stay at   
 school to eat a packed lunch,everyone 
 else had to go home.
