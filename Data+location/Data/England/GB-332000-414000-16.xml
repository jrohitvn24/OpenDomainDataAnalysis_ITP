		<title>16SOUTHPORT FLOWER SHOW</title>
		<content>   The Southport Flower Show takes     
 place during August.It is situated on 
 Victoria Park near Rotten Row.There   
 are alot of tents and many prizes are 
 given for the nicest arrangment,the   
 most unusual plants and so on.As well 
 as plants there are vegetables and    
 copies of garden designs.The people   
 who grow the flowers come from all    
 over the country and sometimes abroad.
   People who come to see the flowers  
 come from all over the world.In the   
 show there are events taking place    
 like show jumping and aerobatic       
 displays.                             
   Within the grounds there are also   
 different adverts for companies       
 eg.Rothmans Cigarettes,Dunlop Tyres   
 and other companies.                  
   The show lasts for only 3 days      
 because by then the flowers start to  
 wilt and die.                         </content>
