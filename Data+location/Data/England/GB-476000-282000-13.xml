		<content>There are lots of games to play,some   
are very old which have been going for 
years and years.There is an old game   
called Hopscotch,my Mum said that she  
used to play this when she was a little
girl.There is a game called Red Rovers 
which is one of my favourite games,what
you have to do is have a group of      
children and split the group up into 2 
teams.The 2 teams go to two different  
ends of the field and hold hands.Then a
person from one of the teams runs up to
the other team and tries to break      
through the other teams arms.If he gets
through he can choose someone from that
team to come and be a member of his    
team.If he doesn's get through he stays
with that team.We also play French     
Skipping,Tig on the Lines, British     
Bulldog and Horses.
