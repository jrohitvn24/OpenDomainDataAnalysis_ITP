		<title>06Village Fete - Sports Day</title>
		<content> Each year in June the village has the 
 annual Fete.  First of all we have a  
 guest to open the fete and give the   
 prizes for the fancy dress, where     
 children dress up in nice clothes.    
 One year someone came as Andy Pandy.  
 Then some children play some tunes on 
 their recorders and violins.  Then we 
 have the running races.  We also have 
 the egg and spoon, obstacles, sack and
 the open race.  Then we have a        
 5-a-side football match arranged by   
 Mr. Bindley, and the winners get a    
 plaque.  Sometimes we have a pet show 
 and a tug of war.  Then you can go    
 round the stalls.  As well as the     
 stalls, we have a bouncy castle and   
 the swing boats.  The stalls are      
 organised by the Guides, Brownies,    
 Youth Club, W.I., School, and the     
 Church Lads and Girls.  The Fete      
 finishes at 6 o'clock.                </content>
