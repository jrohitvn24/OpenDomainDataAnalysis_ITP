		<content>INGLEGLEN-Ingleglen house used to be a 
plant nursery and had an orchard to    
help support the estate.It was sold 25 
years ago.                             
5.Ingleglen just off the A355 is now a 
modern estate built on the orchard and 
on site of the old house.I live        
there,in a detached house with linked  
garages. Front gardens are lawned and  
open plan. Each year we have an        
"Ingleglen party" in the Brian Jubb    
Hall for all the residents.            
6.I live in a modern detached house in 
Blackpond Lane called "Alamanda".The   
land before the house was built is said
to have belonged to Dr.Barnardo Homes. 
7.I live in Beeches Road in a 20 year  
old house which before the last owner  
belonged to a very famous BBC          
television personality.                
8.Golden Oak Close,the new estate is   
where the old telephone exchange was.  </content>
