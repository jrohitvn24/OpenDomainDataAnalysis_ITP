		<title>19LEISURE IN DARLINGTON</title>
		<content>     A lot of people go out of town to 
 spend their leisure time.Darlington is
 in between the Yorkshire Moors and    
 Dales and on a direct route to the    
 Lake District, so obviously walking is
 one of the most popular leisure       
 activities followed by swimming,      
 gardening and squash.There are only   
 two sports centres in Darlington, the 
 Dolphin Centre and one in Larchfield  
 Street.In the Dolphin Centre there are
 about twenty five different sporting  
 facilities - weight training, soccer, 
 roller-skating and snooker are just a 
 few sports.                           
      There are a great many other     
 different types of leisure            
 activities that people do such as     
 Scottish Dancing, lace making, card   
 making and pottery making.
