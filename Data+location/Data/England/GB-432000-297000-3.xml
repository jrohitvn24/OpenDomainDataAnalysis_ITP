		<content> Julie, Michala,  Dawn, Lisa, Kerry,   
 Faye, and two Samanthas are all in    
 Witherley Church Choir.               
 Samantha, Julie, Michala have all     
 been confirmed, so they wear black    
 robes. Dawn, Faye, Lisa, Kerry and    
 Samantha are all "red robes" because  
 we have not been confirmed, but Kerry 
 has just been confirmed and is going  
 up to "black robe" soon.              
 We have got a new choir-mistress      
 called Mrs Durant and she is very     
 kind. Mrs Durant plays the organ for  
 the choir practice and we have a great
 time. We sometimes sing some of the   
 things that we have sung in school    
 before. Last Sunday we had a service. 
 We sit in the pews to sing and        
 practise. When we've finished we say a
 prayer.We also have services on Sunday
 mornings too.Then Julie,Michala and   
 Samantha take the bread and wine.     </content>
