		<title>01THE AREA SOUTH OF STOCKPORT</title>
		<content> This block is situated just to the    
 south of Stockport city centre, and is
 on the edge of the Manchester         
 conurbation.                          
   The main A6 road to Buxton runs     
 through the area as a corridor        
 containing many shops and some small  
 factories. Largely though, the area is
 made up of residential housing, dating
 from Victorian terraced housing in    
 Edgeley to new houses on the southern 
 edge of Hazel Grove.                  
   Stockport itself grew dramatically  
 during the industrial revolution. Our 
 block contains a large unusual{Town   
{Hall,}the{Railway Station}and{War     
{Memorial.}More recent buildings       
 include{Stockport Technical College   
 and the{Telephone Exchange.
