		<title>19Strensham Footpaths</title>
		<content> There are 14 paths shown on the county
 surveyors definitive map, only four   
 appear to be still in use. Only two   
 paths have been sign posted. No 13    
 leaves the Defford road at Bourn Bank 
 bridge and leads to the church as does
 No 3 which leaves the Defford road at 
 Moat farm and skirts the moat itself, 
 stiles and a footbridge across a dyke 
 have been erected along route 8 which 
 leaves Strensham village, passes close
 to the lake on Home Farm and extends  
 across open farmland to the village of
 Naunton. To the east of the village a 
 path leaves the Severn Trent          
 waterworks service road and allegedly 
 passes through Strensham Mill thence  
 along the  bank of the Avon to        
 Strensham Lock. Several footpaths were
 lost when fields were enlarged. Others
 have been destroyed by the motorways.
