    { MR.PITCHERS,}MY CLASS TEACHER,   
HAS BEEN AT THIS SCHOOL FOR NEARLY 12  
YEARS.BEFORE BECOMING A TEACHER HE WAS 
A POLICEMAN AND BEFORE THAT AN OFFICER 
IN THE MERCHANT NAVY.                  
     HE DID NOT LIKE HIS SCHOOL DAYS   
BUT HE THIHKS SCHOOL TODAY IS MUCH     
BETTER.THE WORK IS MORE INTERESTING AND
VARIED.                                
     HE THINKS TODAYS CHILDREN ARE GOOD
TO WORK WITH AND ARE BETTER INFORMED   
THAN CHILDREN OF YEARS AGO.            
     OF ALL THE JOBS HE HAS HAD HE     
LIKES TEACHING THE BEST!BEING WITH     
CHILDREN KEEPS HIS MIND ACTIVE.        
     HE THINKS MODERN CHILDREN ARE     
NOT AS WELL-DISCIPLINED TODAY AS       
COMPARED WITH YEARS AGO AND HE PUTS    
MOST OF THIS DOWN TO THE INFLUENCE     
OF TELEVISION.BY{KIRSTEN BREARLEY}
