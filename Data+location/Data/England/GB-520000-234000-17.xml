		<title>17An Unusual Day</title>
		<content> Today I woke up early at 6 o'clock.   
 I was very excited because today I was
 going with my class and my teacher Mrs
 Elliott and my Headmaster Mr Barratt  
 to the East of England Show at        
 Peterborough.  We were going because  
 we had been working on a project for  
 the last two terms called Sheep and   
 the Uses of Wool.  The result of all  
 of our work was put together as a     
 display and this was being shown in   
 the Schools Tent at the Show. It was a
 jolly good display and my pottery     
 model of a sheep and my wool dieing   
 were there.                           
 After we had been given a prize for   
 our work, we went around the show. We 
 saw lots of farm machinery and sheep, 
 horses and cows and then we went to   
 the main ring where we saw sheep dogs 
 rounding up sheep and sailors climbing
 a mast and horses pulling carts.      </content>
