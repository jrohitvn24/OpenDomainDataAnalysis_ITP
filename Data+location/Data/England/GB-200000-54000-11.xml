		<content>    In the area studied, most of the   
 gardens, especially the smaller ones. 
 were ornamental. However, nearly all  
 incorporated small sections for       
 practical purposes. Some were entirely
 utilitarian. this might be due to the 
 inhabitants earning a low wage and    
 they need to supplement their income. 
 many of the landowners grow all their 
 own fruit and vegetables.             
    All the gardens seem to produce a  
 good yield of crops. The vegetables   
 included potatoes , carrots, runner   
 beans, and sprouts. The fruits        
 included both cooking and eating      
 apples, raspberries, blackcurrants,   
 blackberries, and strawberries. Some  
 gardeners cultivated herbs, the most  
 popular being mint.                   
    On the whole the gardens were      
 well-used and well-kept.
