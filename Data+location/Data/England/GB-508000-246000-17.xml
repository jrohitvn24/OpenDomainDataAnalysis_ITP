		<content>    On  a visit to Cople.  We went  to 
 Chapel End and saw some sheep grazing 
 in a field.  Sheep are very useful in 
 two ways. The  fleece  is  cut in the 
 summer for wool.                      
                                       
    Most of  the  local sheep are only 
 kept for a few months  after they are 
 born. They are then sold as lamb. The 
 sheep  go  to  the  local abattoir or 
 slaughter  house  on  the  A603  road 
 near Mill Farm.                       
                                       
   On  local  farms  the sheep are fed 
 on grass in  the summer and silage in 
 the winter.  In  the  autumn they eat 
 turnip  tops  drilled  into the wheat 
 stubble.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
