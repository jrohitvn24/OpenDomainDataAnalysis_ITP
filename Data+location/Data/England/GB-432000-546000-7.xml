		<content>      Yesterday was Sunday. At nine    
 o'clock I went to the garden to see if
 everything was alright. At ten o'clock
 I went up my gran and grandad Lewins. 
      At eleven o'clock we went to     
{church}till twelve o'clock. After that
 I had my dinner. Then I went up to my 
 grandad's garden to do some potting   
 up. Then I had a game of dominoes.    
 After that I watched the football     
 match. Then I had my tea. After that  
 we went back home. Then I went in the 
 bath. Then I watched Gold Finger on   
{television}and I went to bed after my 
 supper.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
