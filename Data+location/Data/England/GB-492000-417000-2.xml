		<title>02THE LIFESTYLE OF WINTERTON 2</title>
		<content> On Sunday there is a church or Sunday 
 school to go to. When I go home from  
 school I do a few jobs for my Mum and 
 play outside with my brother on our   
 bikes. On Sundays I play outside and  
 then go to my Granny's in Winteringham
 about 2 miles away. I get nearly      
 everything from the shops such as food
 and clothes when my Mum sends me. At  
 school I play with my 3 friends. We   
 normally just play little games like  
 tig or ball games. My friends like    
 Winterton too.
