		<content> Many houses in this area have been    
 extended, only 10 new houses have been
 built in the past 5 years. Many       
 doctors, lawyers and pilots live in   
 the area as London, Bristol, Reading  
 and Swindon are easily accessible.    
     50 years ago, farms used horses   
 and had double the workforce.         
 Machinery has changed all that. This  
 has made life easier and improved     
 crops. There is one new crop from     
 Germany called Trikkally. It is a     
 cross between Wheat and Rape. At one  
 farm, the topsoil has been taken off, 
 leaving a layer of sand. This is taken
 to be used in building and road       
 construction and then the top layer is
 restored. This makes money and        
 improves the soil.
