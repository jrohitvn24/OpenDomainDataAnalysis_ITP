		<title>16BOREHAM A RESIDENTS MEMORIES</title>
		<content> A resident ,born in 1917 who has lived
 in Boreham all her life has seen many 
 changes.There have been many          
 improvements that have made life      
 easier. She remembers as a child      
 gathering sticks for firewood,        
 especially after a storm, collecting  
 water from a stream, and milk from a  
 nearby farm.She now has an electric   
 fire, milk delivered and water on tap.
 Children living in cottages and farms 
 had a long walk to school, and in     
 winter they would leave home and      
 return in the dark.                   
 Our resident remembers with regret    
 some of the fine houses that were     
 demolished to make way for the A.12.  
 trunk road.To the north of the A.12   
 there was a rifle range used between  
 the 2 World Wars, by the Territorial  
 Army.On market days she watched cows  
 and sheep being driven to market.     </content>
