		<content> Because of the locality of the schools
 and the deminished rural bus services,
 children are taken by bus to their    
 respective schools, this service is   
 free if the child lives outside a     
 statutory travelling distance of 3    
 miles (2 miles if under 8).           
 A good number of children live within 
 the 3 mile zone and therefore have to 
 pay when they reach 8 years old. Each 
 child travelling on a school bus      
 requires a bus pass. The ruling       
 regarding travel costs is the cause of
 much dissention.                      
    Each of the schools mentioned is   
 co-educational, and has a parent /    
 teacher association so that throughout
 the children's schooling parents have 
 the opportunity to become more closely
 involved with the schools activities. 
   Parents also have representation on 
 the school governing bodies.          </content>
