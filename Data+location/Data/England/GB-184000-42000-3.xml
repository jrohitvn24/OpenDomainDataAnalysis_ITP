		<title>03TRANSPORT IN 1985</title>
		<content> Nowadays we have cars to travel in.   
 We also have buses and bikes to ride. 
 People ride on motor bikes as well.For
 transporting furniture and goods for  
 shops we have lorries. For quite long 
 distances people travel on trains.    
 When people travel from country to    
 country they usually travel on        
 aeroplanes such as Jumbo jets or      
 Concorde. Some other transport is     
 boats and ships and sometimes         
 helicopters.Besides travelling on jets
 people can get to other countries by  
 travelling on boats but this is       
 usually much slower.If people want to 
 get from one side of quite a big river
 to the other they can go on a         
 ferry.There are two ferries which take
 passengers from Truro to Falmouth and 
 there is a smaller one called King    
 Harry Ferry to take people across at  
 Feock.                                </content>
