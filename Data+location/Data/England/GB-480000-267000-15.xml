		<title>15Sywell Airport.</title>
		<content>The airport in Sywell was built in     
1928. The airport was used during the  
Second World War to teach R.A.F. pilots
to fly and a number of Wellington      
Bombers were built there. Many famous  
people have visited Sywell including   
Her Royal Highness The Queen in July,  
1965. The B.B.C. used the airport to   
film the story of Amy Johnson. Today,  
the airport has three grass runways,   
covering approximately 360 acres. They 
are 909 metres, 700 metres and 528     
metres long. A grass crop is grown     
every year in the triangle in the      
middle of the runways. An average of   
660 aircraft use the airport each      
month. In addition to this, there is an
active school of flying which use the  
airport for local flights. Many        
helicopters use the airport. The       
airport is bordered by farmland and by 
the local Motel.                       </content>
