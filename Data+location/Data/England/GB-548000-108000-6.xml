		<content>      Christmas is even more friendly  
 and inviting. It is an old custom for 
 the village children to come to the   
 church bringing a present, for a      
 deprived child, which they place on   
 the Altar steps. Carols are sung and a
 short talk is given, usually by the   
 Bishop of Lewes. Afterwards all the   
 children walk back to the village     
 centre with lanterns to be greeted by 
 Father Christmas. By the christmas    
 tree Father Christmas gives each child
 a present. Mince pies are served and  
 the Lamb Inn is packed out. Carols are
 rung by the hand bell ringers of Ripe.
 Some poeple stay up to attend the     
 candle lit Midnight Service of Holy   
 Communion.                            
 The bell ringers go absolutely mad on 
 New Years Eve, and at midnight the    
 villagers dance around the christmas  
 tree.                                 </content>
