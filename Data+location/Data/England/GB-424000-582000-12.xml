      We went to Choppington Welfare to
 ask pensioners about Choppington.     
 Miss Hannah Carr was eighty- eight    
 years old.  She goes to the Club twice
 a week on Wednesdays and Fridays.     
    She has lunch, watches dancing and 
 socialises.  She talks about the old  
 days and health.  Neighbours do her   
 shopping and she has no Home Help.    
 She goes on the bus but she likes to  
 go with a friend.  She usually goes to
 Morpeth and Ashington.  When she needs
 new clothes Miss Carr goes to         
 Bedlington.
