		<content> Walton began as a victorian           
 seaside town.  But over the years it  
 has expanded into a commercial centre 
 for tourism. There has always been a  
 tradition for families to come to     
 Walton for holidays.  Over the last 15
 years the caravans have increased by  
 500 to 1900 caravans based at the     
 Martello and South Cliffs caravan     
 parks.                                
                                       
 In the past few years factors which   
 account for the attraction of Walton  
 include natural and commercial        
 advantages such as : the pier, which  
 is the second largest in Britain;     
 amusements; water sports; attractive  
 sandy beaches and waters; public      
 houses; local clubs and relatively    
 warm climate compared with the rest of
 Britain.  It has an average           
 temperature of 17 degrees centigrade {</content>
