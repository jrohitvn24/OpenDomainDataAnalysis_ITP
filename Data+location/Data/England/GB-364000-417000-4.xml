		<content> There are the remains of 4 or more    
 homesteads or farmsteads:  Great Hill 
 Farm, Pimms and Higher and Lower      
 Pasture Barn Farms.  These were       
 abandoned sometime when the reservoirs
 were built for fear of pollution.     
 Still inhabited are Higher Pasture    
 House, built in 1669, which was       
 modernised in 1984 by the North West  
 Water Authority. Lower Pasture House  
 is also still inhabited, whilst       
 Piccadilly is currently being restored
 and renovated.  First mentioned in a  
 deed of 1650 as the site of a water   
 trough in the grounds of Hollinshead  
 Hall (now derelict), the original     
 sandstone trough was unearthed in 1985
 during excavation work, still intact. 
 In Thorny Bank Plantation is a        
 drinking well, visited for opthalmic  
 cures in the 19th century and restored
 by Liverpool Corporation in 1905.     </content>
