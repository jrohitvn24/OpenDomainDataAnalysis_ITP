		<title>03Buscough Landscape (cont)</title>
		<content>The industrial estate is built on the  
site of a former airfield and is       
linked to the A59,the main north to    
south route through south west         
Lancashire.To the extreme south east   
is a post war housing estate           
representing the growth of Burscough   
away from the A59,housing not farmers  
but mainly commuters and local service 
and factory workers.The present        
landscape owes something to the        
drainage of a lake,Martin Mere,the     
building of a canal and railway,the    
industrial utilization of a disused    
airfield and to an influx of commuters 
in the housing estate.Present day      
inhabitants have their livelihoods     
linked to these phases.Older people    
recall the busy days of the canal when 
coal,cotton and grain where moved to   
and from Liverpool and when many       
families worked on barges at New Lane. </content>
