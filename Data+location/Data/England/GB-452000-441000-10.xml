		<content>    Much{entertainment}is,as has always
 been,self organised and rather un-    
 sophisticated.Television provides most
 home entertainment and villagers      
 expect to travel quite long distances 
 for leisure pursuits (sport,theatre.  
 cinema,restaurants et al).            
   There is a Sunday school &amp; a monthly
 youth club held in the{Parish Room,}  
 (also used for coffee mornings, jumble
 sales,church &amp; women's group meetings.
   The{Cricket Club}has 2 teams at its 
 ground just outside the village and   
 runs whist drives &amp; quizzes in winter.
   Church Festivals,garden fetes,fairs 
 feasts &amp; concerts at the Gatehouse    
 barbecues at "The Crown",and school   
 activities all bring people together. 
  {Children}are taken to Colton for    
 horse riding,to Wetherby to swim,to   
 York for judo &amp; gymnastics,to Appleton
 for Cubs,Brownies,Scouts and Guides.  </content>
