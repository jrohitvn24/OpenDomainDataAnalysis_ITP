		<title>11Colburn : an introduction.</title>
		<content>{Colburn}is a{Richmondshire}District   
 Council housing estate,part of which  
 is on the east edge of this block.Most
 of the houses on the western fringe of
 the estate were built 30 years ago ,  
 but newer private housing has appeared
 on both sides of the lane which leads 
 down to{Colburn Village.}Most of the  
 land around{Colburn}is farmland,      
 although the{Army}does own parts of   
 it.{Catterick Garrison}itself, one    
 kilometre WSW of{Colburn,}provides a  
 few jobs for{Colburn}residents,but a  
 good many people travel to{Richmond}or
{Darlington}for work.At this time, a   
 high proportion of{Colburn}people are 
 unemployed,particularly the younger   
 members of the community.The{Easby    
 side of the{River Swale}has become    
 more concerned with Tourism,with the  
{Brompton}road providing a popular     
 route from the{A1}to{Richmond.        </content>
