		<content> P.C.Robinson helped us with our       
 research.The police station in Dunmow 
 is the oldest in Essex.There are 20   
 police officers,one of these is a lady
 They have 6 patrol cars,the fastest is
 a Ford Sierra.There are 3 shifts, P.C.
 Robinson prefers the early one.They   
 don't have police dogs in Dunmow but  
 they can borrow them if they need them
 There are between 6 and 10 break-ins a
 year.Once when milk was being stolen  
 from doorsteps, P.C.Robinson hid in a 
 bush and watched but didn't catch any 
 one.Most of the police work involves  
 traffic,one of the worst places for   
 speeding is the High Street.We also   
 have a traffic warden to make sure    
 cars aren't parked on double yellow   
 lines.If they are,they get a fine     
 ticket and then the driver has to     
 report to the police station to show  
 necessary documents.                  </content>
