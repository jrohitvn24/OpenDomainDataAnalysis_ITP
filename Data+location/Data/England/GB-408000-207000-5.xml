		<content> Sites of mills using water power have 
 remained the same since Saxon times,  
 although the buildings have been      
 altered or replaced. Winson has had a 
 mill since Saxon times and it is      
 recorded in the Domesday Book. It was 
 used for grinding corn and included a 
 miller's house in the 19. Century. In 
 1882 it was still in use as a mill but
 was abandoned in 1912. It has since   
 been converted to a dwelling house. A 
 cornmill was in operation in Ablington
 before the 19. Century. It ceased     
 grinding flour early this century but 
 continued to be used for generating   
 electricity for Ablington Manor until 
 the public electricity supply was laid
 on. All the machinery has been removed
 and the mill converted to a dwelling  
 house.
