		<title>15SOCIAL CONCERNS</title>
		<content> The Main concerns of the villagers are
 the threat of losing some of the      
 telephone kiosks and the amount of    
 nitrates used by farmers.  There are  
 only a few telephone kiosks in the    
 area, but these are used by both young
 and old and are a vital life line for 
 some of the more remote areas.  The   
 nitrate problem is very worrying      
 because it affects all of us.  The    
 nitrate is put onto the land by the   
 farmers, the rain then washes the     
 nitrate out of the soil and into our  
 streams and rivers and then into our  
 drinking water, we have one of the    
 highest levels of nitrates in our     
 drinking water in the country and it  
 is not advisable for babies under one 
 year old to drink it.  The wildlife is
 also at risk as they drink from the   
 rivers and streams.
