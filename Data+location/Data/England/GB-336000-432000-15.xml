		<title>15Mary Smith, dialect poet</title>
		<content>     Mary Smith was born in Weeton     
 nearly 80 years ago, one of twelve    
 children. She left the village school 
 at the age of 13, having had only one 
 day's absence. For forty years she    
 kept the village shop, which had to   
 close in l975.                        
     She loves the village and has     
 never wished to move away. It has     
 always been a closely-knit community  
 and the people have always been ready 
 to help each other.                   
     A major change was the opening of 
 the village hall in l920. This        
 provided a meeting place for the      
 villagers other than the pub and the  
 open air.                             
     She writes dialect poetry and is a
 member of the Lancashire Authors'     
 Association and Lancashire Dialect    
 Society. She has published some of her
 poems and appeared on radio and TV.   </content>
