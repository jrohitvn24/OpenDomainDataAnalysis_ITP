		<title>10ACCOMMODATION IN AYLMERTON</title>
		<content>   Aylmerton is popular with foreign   
 visitors.  "Woodlands" guest house is 
 situated on the A148 Cromer to King's 
 Lynn road, and is well-placed for     
 visitors to the area.  July to August 
 is the most popular time.  It seems   
 very popular, as guests often come    
 back the following year.              
  During the summer, up to twelve      
 guests can be accommodated, with an   
 average of four to six in winter.     
  "Woodlands" has its own swimming pool
 but people tend to go to the nearest  
 beach.                                
  Holidaymakers come from Europe -     
 mainly from Holland and West Germany. 
 Others come from as far away as       
 Australia and Canada on extended      
 holidays of up to three months.       
  "Woodlands" is a family business and 
 the house has recently been extended.
