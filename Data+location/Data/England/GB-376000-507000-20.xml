		<title>20THE AUCTION MARKET</title>
		<content> Years ago{auction markets}were taken  
 in the{streets}of Kirkby Stephen.     
 Fences were fixed at the edges of the 
 pavements so the animals didn't get   
 knocked down by traffic. After every- 
 body had taken their animals home the 
 locals of Kirkby Stephen would sweep  
 sheep and cattle muck up off the      
 streets to spread on their gardens.   
    At the South end of Kirkby Stephen 
 there used to be another{auction      
{market.}South of the{auction}there is 
 the Croglin Castle Hotel (which is    
 still there now) which was an eating  
 place for farmers.Then opposite the{  
{auction}is the railway (which is now  
 closed down) that was used for taking 
 cattle to different counties and      
 farms.The auction market is now at the
 rear end of Faraday Road.Weekly sales 
 are held on a Monday.Important autumn 
 sales attract large numbers of dealers</content>
