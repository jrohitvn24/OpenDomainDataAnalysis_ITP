		<title>011000 YEARS IN HORLEY</title>
		<content>{ Horley}is in the Weald between the   
 North and South Downs on the flood    
 plain of the River Mole. Records tell 
 of a church dated 1084 belonging to   
 Chertsey Abbey. There is also evidence
 of a mill and settlement beside the   
 river. In the 19th century Londoners  
 travelled to the popular resort of    
 Brighton, breaking their stagecoach   
 journey at Horley, approx. half-way.  
 In 1841 the railway opened and a      
 dormitory town developed around the   
 station about 1km from the original   
 settlement. A dramatic change to the  
 area began with the opening of Gatwick
 international airport in 1958 on the  
 site of a small aerodrome and race    
 course. The past 20 years have seen   
 massive growth of the region providing
 housing for airport workers,plus      
 facilities and services for airport   
 users.                                </content>
