		<content> Perhaps the oldest house in the area  
 is Bewsey Old Hall,a Tudor house,built
 on a site which has been occupied for 
 at least 700 years.                   
 Also interesting is the Sankey Garden 
 Suburb,an early example of town       
 planning,based on the ideas of Sir    
 Ebenezer Howard.A 20 acre site with   
 room for 240 houses,with ample public 
 gardens and open space was planned,but
 only four houses were built in Sankey.
 There is much inter and post war semi 
 and detached housing.                 
 Recent years has seen the building of 
 New Town housing in the Hood Manor and
 Old Hall areas.
