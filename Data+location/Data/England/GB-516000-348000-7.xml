		<title>07Health In South Kyme</title>
		<content> South Kyme has no Doctor's surgery or 
 Chemist. Patients travel to surround- 
 ing villages. Doctors or a nurse      
 may arrange a home visit. People      
 requiring  hospital treatment journey 
 to Lincoln or Boston. A Voluntary     
 Hospital Car Scheme was initiated     
 locally, to take those with no        
 transport. Dental care is emphasised, 
 and dentists practice in local towns. 
  During pregnancy, expectant mothers  
 attend ante-natal clinics at the      
 Doctors and hospital. Almost all      
 babies are born in hospital. Midwives 
 and later Health Visitors monitor the 
 childs development. Twice monthly     
 Child Welfare Clinics are held at     
 Billinghay.                           
 An interest in Alternative Medicine is
 developing, and also keeping fit      
 through a more healthy diet and       
 exercise.                             </content>
