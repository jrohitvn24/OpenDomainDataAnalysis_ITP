		<title>11SEWSTERN VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Sewstern is a small pleasant friendly 
 village, part of the Parish of        
 Buckminster.  Mainly a farming        
 community with a population of approx.
 270 people and consisting of 63       
 houses.  Buckminster Trust Estate is  
 the main land owners, but just over   
 half the houses in the village are    
 privately owned.  The area was once   
 dependent upon the open quarry Iron   
 Ore Extraction Industry but all this  
 finished in the early 1970's.         
 Evidence of this is still to be seen  
 with open quarries overgrown with     
 shrubs and trees and the lay and      
 colour of the Land.                   
 Some employment for the villagers     
 comes from the local farms, the       
 Industrial Estate and local           
 landowners, but in the main they have 
 to travel to Leicester, Melton Mowbray
 and Grantham areas.                   </content>
