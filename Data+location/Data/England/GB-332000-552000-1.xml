		<title>01The landscape of Great Orton</title>
		<content> The area consists of a large village  
 and several small hamlets. Great Orton
 is the main village and lies 5 miles  
 south west of Carlisle in Cumbria. The
 hamlets of Woodhouses, Orton Rigg and 
 Baldwinter lie to the south of the    
 village. Scenghmire is in the east of 
 the block. The land is mainly flat and
 lies about 300 ft above sea level. It 
 is an area of fields and some woodland
 From one of the fields near the       
 village, at least 15 churches in      
 Cumbria and South Scotland, can be    
 seen on a clear day. This field is    
 known as Parson's Thorn.Many of the   
 fields have names, such as Goose Skye 
 and Fun Field. Opposite the school is 
 a stretch of village green known as   
 common land. Farmers were allowed to  
 graze their animals here and at Barras
 Gate to the north of the village.
