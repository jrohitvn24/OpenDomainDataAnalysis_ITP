		<content> MARK:-                                
   Some nights we stay in and do       
 homework and watch television.        
   I play in an Ice Hockey team at the 
 weekends and I practise three nights a
 week in term time and every day during
 the holidays.  I also help in my      
 father's fish and chip shop during    
 weekends and holidays.                
   My friend Kevin, helps a local      
 milkman with his deliveries every     
 morning from 4.30 to 8.30 and has a   
 Saturday job as well in a butcher's   
 shop.  He likes cycling in his spare  
 time and normally spends his evenings 
 with friends riding around the estate.
 Sometimes they cycle three miles to   
 the Corporation owned BMX track at the
 Myra Shay recreation ground.          
   Both Kevin and I are typical        
 examples of our age group, we work    
 hard in order to pay for our hobbies. </content>
