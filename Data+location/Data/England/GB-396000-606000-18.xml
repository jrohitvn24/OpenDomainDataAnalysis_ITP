		<content> The Haulage business in the village   
 owned by Alan Blakey and family is    
 involved mainly in agriculture. They  
 have decks that fit on the backs of   
 the wagons to carry sheep and         
 cattle.There is also a trailer which  
 can be towed for this purpose.        
     Cattle and sheep are conveyed to  
 and from marts at Rothbury, Wooler,   
 Acklington,Hexham,Bellingham,Tyneside 
 and sometimes to the Midlands for the 
 Farmers Marketing Corporation.        
   The wagons are regularly used for   
 delivering coal to houses in the area.
 The coal is usually collected from    
 Shillbottle colliery.                 
   The wagons are also used to carry   
 bales of hay and straw, and to convey 
 bales of sheep's wool to the mills in 
 the Scottish Borders.
