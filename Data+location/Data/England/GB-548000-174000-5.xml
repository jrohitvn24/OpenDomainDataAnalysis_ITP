		<content> Splashworld is open from 09.00 -      
 1800hrs. Monday to Friday and 14.00 to
 16.00hrs. on Sundays.  It comprises of
 a large swimming pool with three      
 diving boards, a small pool, a splash 
 pool, a sauna bath and an aquazoom.   
 The depth of the pool varies from     
 three to twelve feet, and is used     
 mainly by the general public and      
 schools.  It is a popular venue for   
 galas as there is a spectator gallery.
 The small pool is three feet deep and 
 is for non-swimmers only.  It is very 
 warm and used mostly by mothers with  
 toddlers.  There are shallow steps at 
 one end.  The aquazoom is two large   
 enclosed tubes.  People can slide down
 the tubes into the splash tube.  The  
 tubes which twist and turn, are eleven
 metres above the surface of the pool. 
 Speeds of thirty miles per hour can be
 reached.                              </content>
