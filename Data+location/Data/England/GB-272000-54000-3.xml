		<title>03OUR DIPTFORD CHURCH</title>
		<content> The{ Church}at Diptford, now 789 years
 old is the centre of the community.   
 Services are held every Sunday and are
 led by the Vicar, who spends most of  
 his time visiting the sick and looking
 after peoples Spiritual needs.  A     
 written record is kept of all births, 
 deaths and marriages.  In the parish  
 the {records} are kept in thre parish 
 chest. For small children who find    
 church difficult to understynd their  
 is a {Sunday} School.  Sunday School  
 last for an hour. We often sing a     
 chorus and hymn after that we have    
 leaflets from the Bible group.  After 
 that we get in a circle for the end of
 the service.
