		<content>{Houses}in{Shooters Way}were{terraced  
 and{built}in{1947.}They were{linked}by
 small{sheds}and we thought that they  
 were really nearly{semi_detached.}They
 were made of{red bricks}with{slanting 
{roofs.}In{Denes Close}the houses were 
 two years older and were made of      
{concrete slabs.}At{Riveredene}the     
 houses there were only{thirteen years 
 old, ones that had been taken care of 
 looked{brand new.}In{Lune Close}some  
 had a{small porch,}they all had{flat  
{roofs}with alot of{wood facing}on the 
 outside of them where the wood had    
 rotted plastic replacements had been  
 put on. The gardens here were smaller.
 I{prefere}the houses at Riverdene,    
 although they were terraced they      
 looked alot bigger and they had all   
 been well looked after. The{roads}were
 much{tidier}too.
