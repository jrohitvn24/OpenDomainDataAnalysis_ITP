		<content>  The ways in which people are employed
 around the Pulloxhill area are        
 extremely varied.This must be one of  
 the biggest changes in the last 50    
 years.Instead of a workforce          
 consisting mainly of farmworkers,     
 there is no one important form of     
 work.Most people travel outside the   
 area to work.There are a few          
 unemployed people and quite a lot of  
 retired folk.Of the remainder there   
 are people who are:aircraft           
 engineer,airline-coordinator,bakery   
 supervisor,buyer,car delivery driver, 
 carpenter,database assistant,designer,
 electrician,farmer,fireman,insurance  
 agent,local government workers,motor  
 mechanic,nurse,school dinner          
 assistant,school caretaker and shop   
 assistant.
