		<content> Moreton Hall became the proprety of   
 Warwickshire C.C.in 1948. It covers   
 200 hectares (500acres) of which 170  
 hectares are farmed. Approximately 2/3
 is grassland to support the animals   
 the remainder is used for growing     
 autumn sown winter wheat and barley.  
 The heavy clay soil prevents the      
 growing of autumn harvested cereals   
 and root crops e.g. sugar beet.       
 The college offers 9 courses to 250   
 full time students each year. A       
 further 250 students are on part time 
 courses. The college also provides    
 courses for young farmers and also    
 evening classes. Many school children 
 visit the college each year to make   
 brief studies of farming. About 17,000
 people use the college facilities each
 year.
