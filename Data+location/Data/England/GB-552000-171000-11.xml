		<title>11LEISURE TIME - PEOPLES VIEWS</title>
		<content>  These are views of some people that  
were interviewed locally about their   
leisure time. Usually the old ladies   
did sewing, knitting or machining. Some
liked to go out driving in their cars  
or have a chat, a walk and a cup of tea
with their friends. Old men usually    
liked to sit around, smoke or go out   
for walks and breath the fresh air! The
younger people liked to go to sports   
centres such as the Fairfield S.C. or  
visiting interesting places, or going  
to the two parks with their children.  
Mothers with young children and those  
with full time occupations had little  
leisure time except at weekends, when  
they could relax with their families.  
  Some people visited the Orchard      
Theatre in Dartford, public houses and 
restaurants or led a more active life  
playing badminton, tennis and other    
sports.                                </content>
