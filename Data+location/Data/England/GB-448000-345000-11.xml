 In our area is the{Mother's Pride}    
 Bakery. It is situated on Main Street,
 Watnall. It provides bread for this   
 area and employment for many of the   
 people living nearby.The size of the  
 building and it's ground is 10 acres, 
 but only 4 acres is covered by the    
 building. There are 3 floors and 10   
 departments. These departments are for
{clerical}and{administration purposes, 
{sales,production,despatch}and{        
{distribution,plant maintenance,hygiene
{stores,personnel welfare,security}and 
{garage.}It was built in 1950 and      
 extensions have been built later.The  
 site was chosen because it was close  
 to the original bakery at Kimberley.  
 There is also good access to the M1   
 motorway for easy distribution.Several
 different types of machinery are used.
