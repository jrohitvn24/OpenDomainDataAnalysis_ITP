		<content> CURDWORTH TENDS TO BE YOUNG TO        
 MIDDLEAGED, CHILD-ORIENTATED, WITH    
 HOUSEHOLD BUDGETING CONCENTRATED ON   
 HOME MAINTENANCE. MOST HOMES ARE      
 PRIVATELY OWNED AND ARE WELL, IF NOT  
 LAVISHLY APPOINTED. MOST POSSESS      
 FREEZERS BUT NOT MICROWAVES AND AVOID 
 JUNK FOOD, CHOOSING TO PREPARE MEALS  
 FROM FRESH OR FROZEN PRODUCE. PETS ARE
 POPULAR. CLEARLY RESIDENTS ARE        
 RESPONSIBLE IN TERMS OF SAFETY        
 APPLIANCES ALTHOUGH LESS INCLINED TO  
 SPEND ON SECURITY. THE LIFESTYLE OF   
 CURDWORTH PRESENTS A PICTURE OF A     
 CARING INVOLVED, FASHIONABLE COMMUNITY
 OF MODEST AFFLUENCE AND SOBER         
 PURSUITS. TELEVISION AND HIFI ARE     
 POPULAR, VIDEOS LESS SO. LEISURE      
 CLUBS, OFTEN TO DO WITH SPORT AND     
 EATING OUT ARE POPULAR, BUT NOT       
 GAMBLING, BETTING OR BINGO. MOST      
 RESIDENTS CHOOSE TO HOLIDAY IN BRITAIN</content>
