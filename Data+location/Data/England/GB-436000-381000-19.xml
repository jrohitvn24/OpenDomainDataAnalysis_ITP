		<content> Driver training- at the former        
 aerodrome you have to be 15 years of  
 age or more to use the tracks.It is   
 open to any member of the public; you 
 do not need a licence,insurance or "L"
 plates.It is not just for cars but    
 motorcycles and lorries may also use  
 it.About 500 vehicles use it each week
 which means that on occassions it can 
 be more congested than the public     
 highways.There is also a "skid-pan"   
 course and the instructors also teach 
 disabled children to handle cars.The  
 site was recently jeopardised by an   
 attempt by a large supermarket        
 chainstore to obtain planning         
 permission for the site. It was       
 rejected.Public transport is a major  
 issue:the cheap fares policy,which    
 allows maximum travel for minimum     
 cost,is under threat from centralised 
 government.This is being resisted.    </content>
