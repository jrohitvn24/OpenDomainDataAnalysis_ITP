 A group of children first decide by   
 picking up or using a rhyme, who shall
 be "it". This person then asks all the
 others to perform, at the same time, a
 type of handstand."It must say        
 "Rain,snow,thunder,lightning" and then
 the name of the handstand required.   
 The person judged best then becomes   
 "it", and the old "it" becomes        
 one of the group for the next round.  
 There are many types of handstand     
 which may be asked for:               
 "Jellywobble" in which the person has 
 to waggle his legs; "Ballerina" where 
 one leg must touch the bottom; "Banana
 splits" where a full splits should be 
 attempted; "Policeman" where one must 
 go over into a crab position and      
 imitate the siren of a police car.    
 There are also "Deadman","Radio"and   
 "Scissors".                           </content>
