		<title>14Peterlee's Faults.</title>
		<content> I don't like living in{Peterlee       
 because it is very{untidy.}There are  
 plenty of litter bins in towns, but   
 there is still{litter}floating about  
 Peterlee.                             
                                       
 Peterlee has lots of{schools}and      
 children travel in from all the       
 surrounding areas to go to them.      
                                       
 Peterlee has a large amount of{grassed
{areas,}but most of it you can't play  
 on .                                  
                                       
 Peterlee has quite a good{shopping    
{centre,}but I don't like shopping. The
{prices of food}are very high, which   
 means people struggle to be able to   
 afford them.                          
                                       
 There should also be more places for  
 children to play.                     </content>
