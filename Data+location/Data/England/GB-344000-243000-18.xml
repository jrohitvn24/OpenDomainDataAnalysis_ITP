		<title>18FUTURE HOPES FOR BURGHILL</title>
		<content> We discussed our hopes for the future.
 Most people thought that nucleur      
 weapons should be destroyed and that  
 there should be better relationships  
 between Western and communist         
 countries. We hope that this area     
 remains much the same as it is now    
 because it is a lovely place to live. 
 Wildlife should be protected and more 
 should be done to protect hedgerows.  
 These important wildlife habitats are 
 rapidly vanishing as farming          
 changes .We would like to see the end 
 of all blood sports.We hope that the  
 village schools remain open as it is  
 important that younger children are   
 educated in their own villages. Older 
 houses and interesting buildings in   
 our area should be kept as they are.
