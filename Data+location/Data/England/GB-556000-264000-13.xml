		<content> The Church holds a{Christingle}every  
 year.This is a service when people    
 take money and get an orange and a    
 candle with which to walk round the   
 Church.The orange represents the world
 and the candle represents the light of
 Christ.They also have nuts on it for  
 the seasons of the world.The idea is  
 to help the{Church of England         
{Children's}Society.It raises Â£400_Â£500
 a year.The Vicar organises it and it  
 started approx in 1977.               
 There is also a{Fete}every year to    
 help repair the Church,provide food   
 for the people's communion and for the
 different charity chosen each year.   
 A committee is in charge of the       
 Fete.There is also a{Sponsored Walk   
 for the Church and{Christian          
{Aid}.About 40_120 people do the trip  
 around the Parish Boundaries.They     
 raise about Â£500.                     </content>
