		<title>05FARMING CHANGES AROUND LEWES</title>
		<content>      Farming around Lewes has recently
 seen much change.Old piggeries and    
 small farms have been absorbed into   
 larger farms. Many allotments         
 remain for small vegetable growers.   
      The Southern Water Authority's   
 sluices and ditches, and farmers'     
 drainage, now prevent much flooding,  
 where one-time summer meadows can now 
 grow cereals and rotation grasses. The
 Common Agricultural Policy of the EEC 
 subsidises cereal prices, encouraging 
 this change. Some farmers reduce their
 dairy herds as milk subsidies decrease
     On the Downs,farmers remove hedges
 and plough steep pastures,to sow      
 heavily subsidised cereals.This has   
 caused recent flooding in Lewes Nevill
 Estate. After heavy rain,surface run- 
 off gathered in furrows,and thousands 
 of gallons of water flowed though     
 allotments,gardens and houses.        </content>
