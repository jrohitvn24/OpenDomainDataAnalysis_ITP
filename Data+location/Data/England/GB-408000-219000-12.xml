		<content> The main Cheltenham to Bourton-on-the-
 Water, A436, road runs across the     
 Block, this being a fast straight     
 road, well maintained, with a large   
 lay-by for lorries and cars. In winter
 the road is regularly gritted and snow
 ploughed if needed by the Local       
 Authority. The minor roads are as well
 maintained as funds allow. In winter  
 the local Snow Plough Warden, one of  
 the farm workers, keeps the village   
 roads clear of snow. Fields ajoining  
 the roads are bounded by the          
 characteristic dry stone walls. The   
 grass verges give rise to a host of   
 common wild flowers, perhaps most     
 impressive is the Cow Parsley, or Keck
 as it is locally known, in early      
 summer and an abundance of white      
 flowering May Blossom. At least a     
 metre of the grass verge is always    
 kept short to aid visibility.         </content>
