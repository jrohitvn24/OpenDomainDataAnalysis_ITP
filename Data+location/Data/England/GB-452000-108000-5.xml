		<content>    Since there are no schools in our D
 block, many of the children travel to 
 nearby villages.  When they are older 
 they go to Swanmore or Fareham.       
    For Further Education people go to 
 the Sixth Form Colleges in either     
 Fareham or Southampton, where the     
 nearest University is.  Nearby private
 schools are Rookesbury Park,          
 Fairfields and Westhill.              
{EMPLOYMENT}                           
 Unemployment is very low in our D     
 block, about 5-l0%.  Quite a few      
 people employ others, e.g. cleaners   
 and gardeners and have their own fees.
 Some people in the area go to         
 Fairthorne Manor and join the course  
 for training to be a "day camp        
 leader".                              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
