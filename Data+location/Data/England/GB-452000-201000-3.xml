     Approximately l000 cars are made  
every 24 hours for 5 days each week.   
It takes about 30 hours to make a      
medium-sized car like the Austin       
Maestro.   Various parts of the car,   
the engine and gear-box for example,   
come to the factory already assembled. 
The "30 hours" relates to the assembly 
of all the different components either 
manufactured at Cowley or received in a
manufactured state from a supplying    
company.   The models made at Cowley   
are the Rover SDI range, the Maestro   
range and the Montego range.   Since   
their introduction in l973, l982 and   
l984 respectively production has       
reached 234,000, 236,000 amd l28,000.
