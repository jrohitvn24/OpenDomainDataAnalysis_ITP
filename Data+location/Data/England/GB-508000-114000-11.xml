		<title>11Employment in Storrington</title>
		<content>    Unlike many areas of Britain,      
 Storrington has a low rate of         
 unemployment. People who live here    
 have many different jobs. Some work on
 the Industrial Estate, others at      
 Linfield Mushrooms. People also work  
 at the Tile Factory, in the local     
 shopping centre, on the nearby farms, 
 at Gatwick Airport and even commute to
 London.                               
    A survey of the pupils in our      
 school showed that most of the mothers
{do}work and that they work locally.   
 This is either because their husbands 
 have the car or they have children to 
 look after. Today more mothers tend to
 work outside the home rather than     
 being purely housewives.              
    Most of the fathers also work      
 locally, but some do travel up to 60  
 miles to work each day.
