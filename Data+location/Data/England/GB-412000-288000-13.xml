		<content>Houses and flats are the chief features
of the landscape of this block. To the 
North of this area the land falls away 
to form a valley through which the     
River Tame flows from west to east.    
This valley is approximately one mile  
wide. Within the valley many industrial
sites are situated, the majority of    
which are used for the manufacture of  
motor car components. A busy section of
the M6 Motorway crosses this area.     
To the south of the valley and on      
higher ground still further south,     
residential property is a prominent    
feature of the landscape. It is in this
area that the River Cole flows.        
Despite the many buildings in the area 
it has been landscaped to provide a    
great deal of green open space with    
many mature trees.
