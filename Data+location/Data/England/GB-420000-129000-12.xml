		<title>12A FARLEY CHILD'S DAY</title>
		<content> My name is Allyssa Gregory. I get up  
 at seven o'clock a.m. and go to the   
 bathroom to clean my teeth and wash my
 hands and face. I then go to get      
 dressed and brush my hair. It's a     
 Wednesday morning and nice and sunny. 
 I then go downstairs to let the dogs  
 out, I have two dogs called Mindy and 
 Dee. I also have three cats called    
 Tiki, Tuppence and Tiddles.           
 After a while my two brothers, Tim and
 Ben, come downstairs. I clean my shoes
 and then have my breakfast (normally  
 Rice Crispies). Mum makes us all a cup
 of tea and at about twenty past eight 
 we go out to the car and set off to   
 school.                               
 We get to school just before nine     
 o'clock. I go into the playground to  
 see all my friends. At nine o'clock   
 the bell rings and we go to our class 
 rooms and then to assembly.           </content>
