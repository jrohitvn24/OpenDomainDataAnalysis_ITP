		<content> The flora of the area is rich and     
 varied.                               
    Egmanton Wood,(now owned by the    
 Forestry Commission),clear felled     
 about fifteen years ago and partly    
 re_planted with soft woods, and Lady  
 Wood are naturally deciduous and      
 contain native species such as ash,   
 small leaved lime and oak. Elm is     
 declining due to Dutch Elm disease.   
 Shrubs include green barked spindle,  
 guelder rose and dogwood. Hedgerows   
 consist largely of hawthornspecies    
 though maple, blackthorn and hazel are
 often seen.                           
    Roadside verges and grassy lanes   
 are bright in Springtime with yellow  
 composites such as cat's ear,         
 occasional cow slips, greater         
 stitchwort and speedwell followed by  
 cow parsley, broad leaved dock and    
 creeping thistle.                     </content>
