		<title>03POPULATION-SPETCHLEY AREA</title>
		<content> The population grew in the medieval   
 period and reached a peak in the 19th 
 century.Recent agricultural           
 mechanisation has  led to a decline in
 numbers.{Sneachill}village now has    
 the largest population containing 37  
 households, mostly young families.    
 In{Spetchley,}past and present        
 employees of the estate now occupy the
 houses.Other tenants include          
 professional people.                  
{Churchill }is a much depleted village 
 and contains isolated farms and       
 cottages, which border on our grid.   
 The population is of an older age     
 bracket like Spetchley.               
{Bredicot,}judging by archaeological   
 evidence, had a Roman population. By  
 1086 it contained 20 persons,in 1871, 
 68 persons but today only 30 people   
 live there of a mixed age range.
