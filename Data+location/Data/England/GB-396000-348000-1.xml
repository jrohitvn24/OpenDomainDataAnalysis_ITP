The area we studied is a part of the   
Staffordshire Moorlands.It is an area  
of countryside and natural beauty which
is a contrast with the nearby city of  
Stoke on Trent and the Potteries.      
  The population is small and housed in
villages such as Wetley Rocks and      
Consall or in isolated farms.          
The land is mostly rural and the main  
employment is dairy farming. The land  
cover is grassland and is used for     
grazing or making silage.              
In the east of the area there is       
woodland and the beautiful Churnet     
valley, through which the river Churnet
and Cauldon canal flow. The canal was  
once used for   transporting raw       
materials for the   iron industry      
which was important   between the 17th 
and 19th centuries.However today it is 
used by the tourist industry.          </content>
