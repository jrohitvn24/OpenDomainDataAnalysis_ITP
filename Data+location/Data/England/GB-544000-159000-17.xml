		<title>17 CUDHAM - BLACKSMITH'S ARMS</title>
		<content> {The Blacksmith's Arms Public House}  
is situated in the centre of Cudham    
between the Church and the village Post
Office with the Recreation Ground      
behind. It is about 300 years old and  
has been a pub for at least 100 years. 
The original building has been extended
and there is now only one bar instead  
of three. The pub provides food with   
meals served at lunchtimes and evenings
(except Sundays). There is a large car 
park and garden complete with barbecue 
and tables. Inside is a games room with
arcade game machines and a dart board. 
 Drinking habits have changed in       
recent years with drinking becoming    
more of a social event. The pub is     
therefore a major social meeting place 
and focal point of village life.       
 Although tastes change with cider,wine
and spirits more popular, draught      
bitter is still the best seller.       </content>
