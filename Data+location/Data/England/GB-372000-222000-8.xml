		<content> MUSHROOM FARMING                      
 The man who owns the mushroom farm is 
 called Mr. Nutting. On his mushroom   
 farm they grow four different types of
 mushrooms, Le-Lion, Syimcel, Oyster   
 and Cream. Mushrooms have to be grown 
 in a special mushroom compost. The    
 compost is made from straw and horse  
 manure. The first job is to plant the 
 mushroom spores into the compost which
 is in trays. These trays are then     
 placed into an air-conditioned  room. 
 Then a layer of peat is placed over   
 the spores to cover them. They are    
 then left for a week. During this time
 they turn fluffy and then they        
 are  ready for moving to a second     
 air-conditioned room for a period of  
 two weeks where they grow into        
 mushrooms as we know them. The        
 mushrooms are then picked for sale.
