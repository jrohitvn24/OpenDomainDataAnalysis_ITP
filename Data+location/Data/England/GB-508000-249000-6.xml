 THE STREAM FLOWS S.E. FROM RENHOLD AND
 RAVENSDEN TOWARDS THE GREAT OUSE      
 RIVER.IT VARIES IN DEPTH FROM 5CM.TO  
 50CM. SOMETIMES THERE ARE DEEP POOLS  
 AND IN OTHER PLACES THERE IS BARELY A 
 TRICKLE OF WATER.                     
 DURING SEVERAL WEEKEND VISITS IN LATE 
 SPRING I SAW COWSLIPS AND BLUEBELLS   
 ALONG THE BANKS. ALTOGETHER I SAW 2   
 STICKLEBACKS,A MINNOW, ROACH, A DACE  
 AND SMALL CHUBB. ALTHOUGH IT IS SO    
 CLOSE TO THE INDUSTRIAL ESTATE THERE  
 ARE MANY BIRDS TO BE SEEN. AS WELL AS 
 THRUSHES,BLACKBIRDS AND SPARROWS I    
 HAVE SEEN CHAFFINCHES,BLUE TITS,COAL  
 TITS AND GREAT TITS.                  
 IN THE PAST I HAVE SEEN MANY SMALL    
 WILD ANIMALS ALONG THE SIDE OF THE    
 STREAM-HEDGEHOGS, RABBITS AND HARES.I 
 ALSO SAW ONE SMALL VOLE.
