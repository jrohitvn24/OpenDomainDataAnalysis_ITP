		<title>09A LIFE IN THE DAY OF CLAIRE</title>
		<content>My alarm goes off at about 7a.m. and I 
read until 7.30. After breakfast I do  
all the normal morning things and then 
my sister and I set off for school.    
 We go into class at 9 a.m. My teacher 
is head of our school. After           
registration we have assembly. It is   
about holidays this month. Back in     
class by 9.40. Maths. until break! At  
playtime my friends and I play with    
some infants. After play we do group   
work on our project.                   
 At 12 o'clock we have our lunch. Some 
children have school dinner, some have 
sandwiches (like me) and some go home. 
 Back to class at 1 p.m. and we have   
rounders. Following our last break, we 
do English until hometime at 3.15.     
 After school I practise my flute and  
after tea I have a water fight with my 
sister in the garden. I go to bed at   
9.30 and read for half an hour.        </content>
