		<title>03BRABOURNE SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   Brabourne School is to be found down
 a lane off the road running between   
 Brabourne and Brabourne Lees.It was   
 built in 1845 on land provided by the 
 Right Honourable Lord Edward          
 Knatchbull,Lord Brabourne.At that time
 the school consisted of a large room  
 divided in two,(one end being for     
 girls and the other for boys)and the  
 master's house.                       
   Today,the school consists of a      
 hall(being the original classroom),a  
 kitchen,and three classrooms,the      
 infant class being in what was the    
 master's house,and the other classes  
 being in temporary buildings.There are
 64 children at the school,the         
 headteacher,two full-time teachers and
 a part-time teacher.Most of the       
 children live in the village of       
 Brabourne Lees.
