 THERE ARE MANY CLUBS IN  NORTHWICH.   
 SOME CLUBS ARE LARGE SOME ARE SMALL,  
 SOME OF THE CLUBS ARE FOR MEMBERS     
 ENTERTAINMENT.MANY OF THE CLUBS ARE   
 PROPERLY ORGANISED,OTHERS ARE NOT.    
 NORTHWICH VICTORIA FOOTBALL CLUB IS AN
 ORGANISED CLUB.THEY HAVE A SOCIAL CLUB
 OUTSIDE THE GROUND.I HAVE COMPARED    
 "VIC'S"WITH ANOTHER CLUB AT           
 WINNINGTON.THERE ARE MANY GAMES AND   
 ACTIVITIES IN THE YOUTH CLUB,IT IS RUN
 ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS. OUTINGS ARE     
 ORGANISED FOR MEMBERS.THE TWO CLUBS   
 ARE VERY DIFFERENT AND SERVE DIFFERENT
 PEOPLE.THERE ARE MANY CLUBS IN        
 NORTHWICH WHICH ARE ORGANISED AND RUN 
 BY PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT INTERESTS.FOR
 EXAMPLE,NORTHWICH ROWING CLUB HAS BEEN
 STEADILY GROWING FOR MANY YEARS.IT    
 ENTERS CREWS IN ALL GROUPS AT REGATTAS
 AND HAS ONE ENGLAND SQUAD MEMBER.     </content>
