		<title>05Religion.-Sutton Church.</title>
		<content>  There has been a church in Sutton    
 since the 12th century.Early in the   
 15th century the west tower was       
 built.It is built of stone with a     
 slate roof. There is a legend about a 
 tunnel in the East Wall.We think it   
 leads to the Old Rectory cellars.It is
 now blocked up because it caved in    
 half way.The oldest part of the church
 is the massive arch in the North      
 wall.It was built about 1080.On one of
 the walls there is a kind of boiler   
 house with stairs leading down to     
 it.It has a flat roof.The church has  
 a grave yard. The church is called    
 Saint Michael and all Angels.         
   The Rev.L.S.Rivett is the present   
 Rector.There is at least one service  
 every Sunday at this church.There is a
 Sunday School for the children of the 
 three villages of Sutton,Elvington and
 East Cottingwith.                     </content>
