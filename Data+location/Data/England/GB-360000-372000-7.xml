		<content> The nearest police station is at North
 wich- about 3 miles away. Weaverham   
 used to have its own small police     
 station with a policeman living there 
 but it was closed a few years ago and 
 the house was sold. Now we just have  
 one policeman who is responsible for  
 this village. He tries to get to know 
 the people in the village so that they
 can go to him for help and advice and 
 he is always on the lookout for any   
 trouble. Unfortunately he is only on  
 duty for about 1/4 of the week. At    
 other times policemen from Northwich  
 drive or walk through the village at  
 certain times. The local policeman    
 likes the village very much. He does  
 not have very much serious crime to   
 deal with- burglary mainly by         
 criminals from nearby cities, some    
 vandalism by youths and break-ins at  
 one of the four village schools.      </content>
