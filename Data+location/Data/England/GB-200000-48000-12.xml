		<title>12Castle Gotha,Porthpean</title>
		<content> Most of the prehistoric fortifications
 in Cornwall were made by Iron Age     
 Celts.These fortifications are of two 
 types,cliff castles and true hill     
 forts.Traces of about 22 cliff castles
 and 27 hill forts can still be seen.  
 Most of the smaller forts are situated
 on undulating ground,between 200 and  
 400 feet above sea level.Castle Gotha,
 near St.Austell is among one of these 
 castles to be found in Cornwall.      
 Covering about one and a half acres   
 between Porthpean and Pentewan its    
 defences were erected before 100 B.C. 
 and its occupation continued well into
 the second century A.D. The           
 inhabitants lived in timber huts in   
 the Lee of the ramparts and included  
 metalworkers who penannular bracelets.
 Parts of a tin ingot mould was found  
 in the floor of one of the huts.
