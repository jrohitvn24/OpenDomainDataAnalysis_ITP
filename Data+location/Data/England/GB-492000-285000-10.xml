		<title>10St.Andrew's Church</title>
		<content> The church was built between 750 and  
 825 AD but by 875 AD the Danes had    
 burnt it down. The church was rebuilt 
 and now has a fine Saxon arch and     
 Saxon windows. The south and north    
 aisles and chancel were added at a    
 later date and the spire dates from   
 1200 AD. A resident priest is         
 mentioned in the Doomsday Book. The   
 living was in the gift of the Crown   
 but is now the patronage of the Bishop
 of Peterborough. People come to see   
 this church because of its great age  
 and because there is evidence of      
 various styles of building, right up  
 to the Elizabethan period. For        
 instance the turret and base tower and
 great arch remain  intact from the    
 Anglo-Saxon church of 900 AD. The     
 present seating was installed in 1873,
 every summer there is a flower        
 festival which attracts many visitors.</content>
