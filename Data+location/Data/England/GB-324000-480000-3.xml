{gets up she feeds my baby brother Carl
{and then she changes his nappy and    
{gets us ready for school. When we are 
{at school she does the housework and  
{takes Carl for a walk. When we come   
{home she makes our tea. My Dad doesn't
{get home until our bedtime as he works
{at Sellafield, then my Mum makes his  
{tea.    NICOLA aged 7
