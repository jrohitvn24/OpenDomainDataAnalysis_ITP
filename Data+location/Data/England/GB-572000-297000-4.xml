		<title>04FARMING IN NORTHWOLD</title>
		<content> Mixed arable farming is the main type 
 of agriculture practised in the area. 
 The main crops grown are cereals,sugar
 beet,potatoes,peas,strawberries and   
 carrots.Some farmers also have a few  
 over wintered cattle.                 
 Farmers tend to practice a three year 
 crop rotation.Crops are sold to which 
 ever representative offers the best   
 price.                                
 Most farms are highly mechanised      
 through all stages of crop            
 development.Ploughs,tractors,combine  
 harvesters,balers,drillers and        
 sprayers are all familiar sights.Each 
 machine can cost several thousand     
 pounds.Employment tends to be confined
 to the family (normally father and    
 son) with the farmers wife helping at 
 peak harvest time.In addition casual  
 workers are employed for large,short  
 lived harvests like strawberries.     </content>
