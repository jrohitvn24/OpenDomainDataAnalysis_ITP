		<title>17FARMING SHEEP IN BIRCH</title>
		<content>{ Lukes Farm}is part of the Birch      
 Estate and has 100 acres of grassland.
 The sheep are managed by a shepherd   
 with the help of two students from an 
 agriculural college.                  
  About 300{ewes}were kept at the farm 
 100 Scotch Halfbreeds,55 Mules which  
 had speckled faces and 145 cross Clun 
 Forest.                               
  The ewes are taken into a large pen  
 just before they are about to give    
 birth to their{lambs.}Whan the lambs  
 have been born they are put into a    
 small pen with their mothers for five 
 days whilst their progress is         
 carefully monitored. Eventually they  
 are moved to larger pens inside open  
 barns where they mix with other ewes  
 and lambs. After one month they are   
 finally put out into fields.          
  At the end of the lambing season     
 about{700 lambs}will have been{born.  </content>
