      Each of the villages             
 -predominantly well maintained        
 two-storey cottages and houses of     
 great character and charm - is        
 surrounded by farmland where          
 ever-increasing mechanisation has     
 meant less and less work for the      
 indigent labour force.   Older        
 villagers recall that, where it once  
 took 20 men to bring in the harvest,  
 it now takes only three.  The younger 
 generation have gravitated to jobs in 
 the nearby towns of Brackley, Banbury,
 Bicester, Buckingham and Northampton. 
 Some work at Cowley Motors,Oxford;    
 local "service" jobs include the      
 R.A.F.and the American base at Upper  
 Heyford, four miles distant.  A few   
 professional people commute to London.
