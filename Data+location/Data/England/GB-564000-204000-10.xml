		<title>10WRITTLE, VILLAGE GREEN</title>
		<content> Writtle Green is one of the prettiest 
 village greens in Essex. It is in the 
 centre of Writtle,which is about 4km. 
 from the nearest town, Chelmsford and 
 45km. from London.                    
        It is still very much part of  
 everyday life for the people who live 
 in Writtle. The grassed area is used  
 as a playground by the children who   
 can regularly be seen playing chase,  
 football or cricket and as a pretty   
 way to church or a pleasant place for 
 walking the dogs by adults.           
       Families often visit the Green  
 to feed the ducks on the              
 pond,especially in Spring when the    
 surface of the water is dotted with   
 fluffy yellow and brown chicks.       
 Sometimes people come just to sit on  
 the benches and enjoy the willows and 
 peaceful atmosphere. The annual fete  
 also is held there.                   </content>
