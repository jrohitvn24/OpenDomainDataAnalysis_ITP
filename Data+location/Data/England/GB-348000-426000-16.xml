		<content>We did a survey about recreation.People
in their spare time like to play sport 
with their friends.Most people swim    
about once a month though there are no 
swimming baths in the D-block.A lot of 
people spend some of their spare time  
in the pub-there are two pubs in the   
D-block;The Tom Finney and The Fleece  
Inn.Most people dislike smoking and    
smokers.There is a leisure centre in   
the D-block that a lot of people use.A 
few people go jogging and cycling      
though quite a lot prefer to watch     
television especially sport.Most people
go out for a meal now and then.Young   
people like pop concerts though there  
are never any in the D-Block.
