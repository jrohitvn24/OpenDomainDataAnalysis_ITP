		<title>01THE SOUTH DOWNS</title>
		<content> The principal natural feature of the  
 area is the South Downs. They provide 
 an important recreational area for    
 walkers and horseriders and motor cars
 are also allowed limited access. The  
 path along the chalk ridge is         
 designated as a long distance path and
 is known as the South Downs Way. It   
 extends from Beachy Head in the East  
 to South Harting in the West. The     
 Downs are extensively farmed and      
 arable use has given way to grazing.  
 Sheep, once a familiar part of the    
 scene, are now grazed on the lower    
 slopes. Views from the Downs are      
 spectacular with the North Downs      
 visible on a clear day. The area in   
 between is known as the Weald, once   
 heavily wooded and supporting an iron 
 industry.
