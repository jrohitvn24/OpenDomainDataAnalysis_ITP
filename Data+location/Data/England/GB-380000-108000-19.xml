		<content> Okeford Fitzpaine is situated about s 
 mile from the main A357. The nearest  
 railway is at Gillingham and there is 
 a strong sense of isolation amongst   
 village people.  Most of the younger  
 families have a car, but many of the  
 older or poorer inhabitants rely on   
 the bus service which travels twice   
 daily to Sturminster Newton and       
 Blandford, or on the special market   
 day services to these two towns.      
                                       
 In a recent survey in the village,    
 there are 159 cars and 11 motor bikes 
 in use. Some concern has been         
 expressed about the heavy vehicles    
 travelling through the village, and   
 the general speed of traffic.
