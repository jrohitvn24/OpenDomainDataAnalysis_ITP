		<title>11ETHERLEY - HISTORY - 1</title>
		<content> Etherley used to be a Pit Village.    
 The last colliery closed in 1968.     
 Sixty years ago, mining was a natural 
 choice of job for a 14 year old and a 
 walk to Hamsterly was the usual way to
 get to work.  Pay was 6 pence a day   
 for a six day working week.  After    
 1926 unemployment rose and most left  
 school at 14 to join the dole at 37.5 
 pence a week.                         
    In 1947 an explosion in the mine at
 West Auckland brought home the dangers
 of working underground.  Two men were 
 killed and five burnt.                
    Havelock Holmes, a 76 year old     
 local resident says that times have   
 changed in Etherley.  Beer used to be 
 3 pence a pint but women were 'looked 
 down on' if they drank in public.
