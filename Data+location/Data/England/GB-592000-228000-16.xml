		<title>16Hopes and Fears</title>
		<content> We have three main fears, one is that 
 there will be a third world war and it
 will be a nuclear war.If this happens 
 the chances are that we will not      
 survive. Another fear is that we      
 will run out of gas, electricity,oil, 
 coal and petrol.These are our main    
 sources of energy.Our third fear is   
 vandalism.There are already too many  
 vandals.                              
         We all hope there will be     
 some good things in the future like   
 interesting jobs.One of the boys would
 like to be an inventor of robots      
 because inventors often become        
 famous,another a fireman because it   
 would be exciting, one a farmer like  
 his dad.The girls have different      
 ambitions,to be a hairdresser, or work
 with horses,to nurse young children,to
 teach or play the flute. We all hope  
 our village will not change.          </content>
