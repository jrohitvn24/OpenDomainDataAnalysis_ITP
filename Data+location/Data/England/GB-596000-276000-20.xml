		<content>There are no doctors in Market Weston  
and Barningham but surgeries are held  
in Hopton, Ixworth &amp; Botesdale.These   
dispensing Health Centres provide ex-  
cellent services such as Pre-natal,    
Well Person &amp; Family Planning clinics  
plus ample back up facilities.         
Community nursing plays an invaluable  
role in this rural situation giving    
important nursing care in the home.    
West Suffolk General Hospital is a     
modern hospital with many facilities   
serving this area. Transport is        
supplied to the hospital if patients   
need it. Mobile units visit Hopton     
Village Hall car park for chiropody    
care. There is at present fundraising  
in progress for an Hospice in Bury St  
Edmunds which will serve our villages.
