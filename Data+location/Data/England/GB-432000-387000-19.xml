		<title>19A DAY IN MY LIFE (SHEFFIELD)</title>
		<content>   Hello, my name is{Jamie}and I am 9  
 years old. On Friday, when I get to   
 school, I have a game of marbles. Then
 the whistle goes and when I am in the 
 classroom we finish off some S.M.P.   
 (mathswork).                          
                                       
   Then it is time for craft and this  
 week we made pots. It is brilliant. It
 is all sticky and gooey. I made a pot 
 with a lot of patterns, it was good.  
 At home time (3.35p.m.),I am happy.   
                                       
   At 7 p.m. it is{Boys' Brigade.}First
 it is parade, then we buy some sweets,
 then we have a game. We play football,
 then write, knit or sew.              
                                       
   At 9 o'clock I go to my Nanan's to  
 sleep. We have a beer and a shandy,   
 then go to bed.                       
                                       </content>
