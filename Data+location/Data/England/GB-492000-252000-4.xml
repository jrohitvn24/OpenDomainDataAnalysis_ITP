		<title>04The use of Woodland</title>
		<content> The area has some estate woodland and 
 most notably the parkland- type       
 associated with English country houses
 at Turvey House and Turvey Abbey.The  
 woodland at Snelson,mainly oaks and   
 ash are for commercial purposes and   
 coppiced every 15 years.Thet also     
 provide  gamecover for shooting.In the
 last 35 years 84,000 conifers have    
 been planted.Of particular interest is
 an area of 8000 Bat Willows.Those     
 planted at the edge of the plantation 
 come to maturity in 16 years as their 
 roots have access to water,whilst     
 those in the middle take 22-23        
 years.When they are cut their trunks  
 are just thick enough to reach        
 around.They are sent to a firm in     
 Essex who also have a nursery of sets 
 for replanting.The timber is made into
 cricket bats and the branches are used
 to make artificial limbs.             </content>
