		<content>    The farm is also important for     
 dairy farming. The farm has twenty    
 Friesian cattle. These can produce ten
 gallons each a day. The milk is sent  
 to Grimsby Dairies. The previous      
 tenant used to own sheep. The sheep   
 could be sheared by a farm labourer at
 the rate of 104 to 120 a day.The wool 
 was sent to Bradford.The sheep were   
 sold,if they had to be at Brigg,Market
 Rasen and Barnetby markets.           
    The cattle are fed on grass, cake  
 and dairy nuts.They are given nuts in 
 proportion to the amount of milk they 
 produce.In 1960 they used to slaugter 
 their own pigs with a stun gun loaded 
 with chemicals.Now animals must be    
 killed at a slaughter house.The cattle
 used to graze on the famous Cabourne  
 grass which were supposedly the finest
 grasses in the country.Today only     
 twelve acres remain.                  </content>
