		<content>   I wake up in the morning and I play 
 with my three dolls,Tina,Sally and    
 Lucy.Afterwards I go downstairs and   
 have Cocopops,apple juice and bread   
 and honey for breakfast.I go upstairs 
 and get dressed.                      
   Today I am wearing my checked dress 
 and my white socks and sandals.I brush
 my teeth,comb my hair and wash my     
 face.Then I go back downstairs and get
 my satchel and swimming bag.We go to  
 school in Julie's car.                
   At school we have an assembly.When  
 we get back we do times tables..After 
 swimming we have a short break and    
 then we go home for lunch.When we come
 back we do some work.After break we   
 have a short story,then we say prayers
 and we go home.                       
   After school I play with my friend  
 and then have my tea.Finally I get    
 undressed,have a wash and go to bed.  </content>
