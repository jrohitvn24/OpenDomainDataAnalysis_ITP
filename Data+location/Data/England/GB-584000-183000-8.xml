		<title>08Sunday with my family</title>
		<content> At about half past eight my family get
 up. Daddy goes and makes a cup of tea.
 When we go downstairs our dog Lady    
 goes wild. Daddy takes Lady for a     
 walk. Mummy makes the breakfast while 
 Emma and I watch Superbook on the TV. 
 When Scoopy-doopy-dog is on we are    
 called for breakfast. After breakfast 
 daddy goes to football and mummy cooks
 the dinner. At 11.00 Emma and I go off
 to Sunday school at Leigh Methodist   
 Church. At 12.00 we come home. We have
 a roast lunch and the dog always sits 
 by my feet. After lunch we go into the
 garden. Mummy weeds while daddy grows 
 his vegetables. Emma plays while I    
 play with the dog. At 4.00 I go for   
 tea. I play until 7.00 and then I go  
 to bed. My sister goes to bed at 6.00.
