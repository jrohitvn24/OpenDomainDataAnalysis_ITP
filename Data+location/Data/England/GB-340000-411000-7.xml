		<title>07Burscough-Farming Concerns</title>
		<content>  A local farming family has expressed 
concern over several recent trends.    
Firstly, in a time of surplus          
production in Europe and U.K., income  
does not meet the increasing expenses  
such as fertilizers, chemicals,        
containers and spare parts. Not enough 
income means not enough capital in     
industry to cover overheads            
(depreciation,rents,rates and running  
expenses)                              
  Secondly we appear to be in a peroid 
of anti-farming by certian influential 
bodies, both inside and outside        
Parliament. Organisations such as      
Friends of  the Earth,Nature           
Conservancy Council and the Dept of    
Environment hove all applied           
pressures which make farming more      
difficult,such as new rules on chemical
spraying and safety at work.
