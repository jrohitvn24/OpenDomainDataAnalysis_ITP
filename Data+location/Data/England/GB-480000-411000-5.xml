		<content> The compost is ruffled through a      
 machine.The spawn is then added.The   
 spawn is mycelia.It is so small,like  
 very fine dust or powder which is     
 specially prepared in labortories.It  
 is put onto grains of wheat or millet,
 or onto a kind of stick.These are     
 inserted into the compost and the     
 mycelia spreads out.The room is kept  
 at 25 degrees C for 10 days.The       
 compost must be kept moist.The        
 palettes are then taken from the spawn
 running room to the preparation room. 
 Here there is a machine which mixes   
 a covering called a casing.It is a    
 mixture of 50.8kg of peat and 50kg.of 
 chalk.The chalk makes the mixture     
 alkaline.The casing mixture is then   
 saturated with water and spread into  
 the compost about 3.8 cm deep .The    
 palettes are then transferred to the  
 growing room.There are 7 growing sheds</content>
