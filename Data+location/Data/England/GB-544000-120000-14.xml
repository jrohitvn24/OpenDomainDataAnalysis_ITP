		<title>14OUR WOODLANDS.</title>
		<content>    All of this area was thickly wooded
 in ancient times:the Romans called it 
 the{Great Forest of Anderida}and the  
 11 woods in the survey region are     
 probably descendants of that earlier  
 forest.They are all privately owned   
 except for{Park Wood}owned by the     
{Forestry Commission.                  
    Most of the woodland is{mixed      
{deciduous};oak,beech,hazel,birch,     
 hornbeam and sweet chestnut(which was 
 planted for coppicing)are commonly    
 found in this area.                   
    Under the trees are usually        
 brambles and honeysuckle near the path
 edges.Bluebells,primroses,wood anemone
 and violets grow where the light is   
 strong enough.                        
    The woodlands are{habitats}for     
 mice,voles,weasels,squirrels,hedgehogs
 ,badgers,butterflies and birds.A few  
 deer may have strayed in from outside.</content>
