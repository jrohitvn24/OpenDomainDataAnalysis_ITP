		<content>    The houses in this area are mainly 
 old, dating back as far as the        
 thirteenth century.  There are many   
 examples of Essex thatch and          
 pargetting which attracts tourists to 
 the largely unspoilt picturesque      
 villages of Little Dunmow and Felsted.
                                       
   There are many large country houses 
 (some with stables) spread throughout 
 the area.  There is also a moated     
 farm house.                           
                                       
   A few Victorian buildings were      
 erected, such as the old schools at   
 Little Dunmow and Barnston which are  
 now converted to houses.
