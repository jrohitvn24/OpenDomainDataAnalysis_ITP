		<title>13THE RACE COURSE</title>
		<content> The present road layout does not      
 follow the course.  The mile course   
 ran from the{Plough Public House,     
 opposite{Northolt Station,}to the top 
 of{Dabbs Hill}Lane, where the stands  
 were located.                         
                                       
 One of the most successful of the     
{Northolt Race Course jockeys,}now well
 into his seventies, lives in a house  
 built on the finishing line.  There   
 are a few other ex-Course workers     
 living on the Estate, but the majority
 of those who earned their living on   
 the Race Course did not return from   
 the Second World War.                 
                                       
 The Estate boasts a pair of{Iron Gates
 which are the same as those through   
 which the Queen rides at Royal Ascot.
