		<title>13A SOUTH HYLTON FOOTPATH</title>
		<content> There used to be a railway line from  
 Sunderland to Durham. This line passed
 through S.Hylton. For a long time     
 after the line was closed it was just 
 waste land. Now the council have      
 turned it into a good footpath using  
 small rocks with grass on either side.
 In some places they have planted trees
 and shrubs but many have been         
 vandalised. The path is very popular  
 and people use it for walking,        
 cycling, dog exercising, jogging and  
 horse riding. Sadly motor cyclists    
 sometimes use the path and are a      
 nuisance. Some time ago a woman was   
 killed on the path by a motor cyclist.
 The council have erected barriers to  
 try to stop the motor cyclists. The   
 barriers have gaps for prams and are  
 low enough for cycles to be lifted    
 over.
