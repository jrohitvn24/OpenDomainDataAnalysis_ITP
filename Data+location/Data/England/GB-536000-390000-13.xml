		<content> Television provides the most          
 entertainment in our area, as well as 
 the broadcast programmes many people  
 hire video tapes of feature films.    
 The village hall in Alvingham is a    
 very popular place, it is used for    
 dances, social and youth clubs, play  
 school and village meetings. Every    
 Sunday it is open for families, there 
 is a large hall for the children and a
 room with a bar for the adults.       
 In order to see amateur dramatic      
 productions, the cinema, concerts or  
 recitals people have to go to Louth.  
 For "Professional" theatre, Lincoln is
 the nearest.                          
 Louth is the nearest place for sports 
 facilities, and has a swimming pool,  
 sports hall, tennis and squash courts,
 a cricket pitch and a golf course.
