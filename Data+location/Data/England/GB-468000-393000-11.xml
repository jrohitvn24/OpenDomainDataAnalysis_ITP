		<title>11THE SCHOOL</title>
		<content> We have a small school in Misson of 55
 children.There are 3 teachers we also 
 have 3 classrooms and a big hall which
 is used for a dining room and         
 assemblies and many other things.We   
 have a little P.E store which we keep 
 all the apparatus in and there is also
 a space in there where we keep our    
 tables and chairs .We have a little   
 cloak room and at each side of it     
 there are the boys toilets and the    
 girls toilets.A pianist comes in 2    
 mornings a week and plays the piano so
 we can have singing and recorders.We  
 have a little room called the staff   
 room where the teachers go at playtime
 except for the one on playground duty.
