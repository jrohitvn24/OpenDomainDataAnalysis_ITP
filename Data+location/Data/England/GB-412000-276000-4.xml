		<content> The main industrial area in our part  
 of{Solihull}is the{Cranmore Industrial
{Estate,}just off the Stratford road.  
 The mainly brick buildings are        
 screened with hedges and trees.       
 There are approximately 40 firms      
 manufacturing a variety of products   
 from gateaux to machine tools. The    
 largest factory covered 70,000 sq.    
 feet and employed 320 people. The     
 smallest covered 3000 sq. feet and    
 employed 3. Many buiuldings were two  
 stories high.                         
 2/3 of the work force were men, many  
 women worked part time. There are few 
 young trainees. Some of the firms were
 over a century old, moving to the     
 estate over the past 47 years. Carrs  
 Paper Ltd. was the first.             
 About half the firms exported goods to
 most areas of the world.
