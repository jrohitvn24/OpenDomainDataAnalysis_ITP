 The southern boundary of our D block  
 is approximately 5 km north of Leeds  
 city centre.The main arterial roads   
 running north to south converge with  
 the A61 near St. Andrew's School and  
 at the Alwoodley roundabout.We        
 conducted a traffic survey near       
 the school and our findings are       
 reported in the traffic survey p.18   
  Running east to west across our D    
 block is the Leeds outer Ring Road
