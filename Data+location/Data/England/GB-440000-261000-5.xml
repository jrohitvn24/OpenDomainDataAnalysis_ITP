		<title>05Education in Southam</title>
		<content>  Southam is well catered for in the   
 educational sense. Children can start 
 school at three years of age by       
 attending the nursery department of   
 St.Mary's R.C. Combined School. At    
 four and a half to five years old,    
 children start full time education    
 either attending Southam's First and  
 Middle Schools or St.Mary's R.C. They 
 stay in primary education until they  
 are twelve. There is a C.of E. First  
 school where children attend until the
 age of eight. At twelve some children 
 transfer to Southam School. Here they 
 pursue subjects to C.S.E.,16 plus, O  
 and A level standards. Other children 
 travel to Leamington and Warwick by   
 bus to attend schools there.          
  After success at A level, children   
 may then go to a university or college
 to continue their studies. Warwick    
 University is nearest to Southam.     </content>
