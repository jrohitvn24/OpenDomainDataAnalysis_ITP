		<title>11HOUSING-RAVENSCROFT ESTATE</title>
		<content>  The Ravenscroft council estate was   
 built fifty years ago but the houses  
 are still in a reasonable state of    
 repair.The gardens are well tended    
 and people tend birds, animals and    
 trees well.The woodland surrounding   
 the estate is full of common species  
 of bird and wild vegetation.The       
 shopping area is well used although   
 people complain about the lack of     
 variety.The frequent bus service is   
 popular although the buses tend to    
 travel slowly. The estate itself is   
 clean except for the vandalised       
 shopping centre.There is              
 some accommodation specially for the  
 elderly who enjoy living here.Few     
 people attend nightschool as transport
 and lack of money are problems.       
 Children tend to get bored as         
 there are very few play areas for     
 them.On the whole,people seemed happy.</content>
