		<title>10VILLAGE SCHOOL INCE BLUNDELL</title>
		<content>   Education for children up to the age
 of 11 years is provided at Ince       
 Blundell R.C. Primary School. The     
 school was built in 1843. The school  
 was endowed and the land given by the 
 Weld-Blundell family.It was built by  
 Martin Billington.                    
   The school is built of large        
 sandstone blocks with a tiled roof(not
 part of the original building).There  
 are two classrooms and a              
 dining/resourse area.                 
   The headteacher is assisted by two  
 part-time assistant teachers.         
   Most of the children live in the    
 village.Although the school is a      
 Voluntary Aided Roman Catholic school,
 almost half the children are of other 
 denominations.At this time there are  
 25 children on roll.
