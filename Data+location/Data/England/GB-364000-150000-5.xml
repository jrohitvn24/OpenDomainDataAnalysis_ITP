		<title>05A view of Chilcompton</title>
		<content>{Chilcompton}is a small village. The   
 part which I live in is on the top of 
 a hill. The very old part is situated 
 in the valley.{The River Somer}runs   
 it's course from the top of the       
 village down through the watercress   
 beds, past the pig farm, to a         
 beautiful river through the centre of 
 the village known as{The Street Ponds.
 As well as a watercress farm and a pig
 farm, the village until recently had a
 large saw mill. This closed down in   
 1984 due to{Dutch Elm Disease.}Many of
 the villagers became unemployed and   
 many of the men in the village found  
 it difficult getting other work. In   
 the village there are four places of  
 worship, one Catholic, two Church of  
 England and a Methodist. There is a   
 village school, a post office, two    
 grocery shops and a craft shop. I like
 living here, because it is so friendly</content>
