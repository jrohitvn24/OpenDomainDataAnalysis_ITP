		<title>20Life Styles: Farmer/Vicar</title>
		<content>Most of the land around Cholsey and    
South Moreton is farmland but farming  
does not employ many people, as one    
farm worker can operate many different 
types of machinery. Most of the land   
is used for growing crops so machines  
for {ploughing, sowing, spraying and   
harvesting} are needed. The farm worker
spends long hours in the open air, in  
all weathers is and not very well paid.
The Vicar is in charge of the church   
and is much in demand for Christenings,
weddings and funerals. He also has to  
try and get the community working      
together and is involved in all kinds  
of committees and organisations. People
from all walks of life will turn to him
in times of trouble for advice, comfort
and an understanding ear. Each Sunday  
he has to lead two or three church     
services and at all times must attend  
to the needs of his parishioners.      </content>
