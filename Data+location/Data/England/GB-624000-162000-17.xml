		<content> The Landlady of the "Dog and Duck"    
 finds that trade is very{seasonal}and 
 tied to the comings and goings of the 
{Caravan site}residents. In winter     
 there are few customers, but with     
 better weather the Caravan Owners     
 start to arrive and{'Village'}life    
 starts. The caravaners are a 'happy   
 lot' and there  are many characters   
 among them, some of whome become      
{unofficial community leaders.}One, the
 'Mad Welshman' is a beloved talking   
 point. Things are dull by comparison  
 when he is not on site. The only other
 regular customers are tent campers,   
 and the boating and angling           
 fraternities. They are most welcome,  
 but the anglers do tend to be muddy   
 and to favour  antisocial costume and 
 accountrements. Others at the bar     
 beware of wet oilskins and maggots in 
 the beer!                             </content>
