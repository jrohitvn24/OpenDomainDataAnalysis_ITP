		<content>   The A171, Whitby to Middlesborough  
 and A169 Whitby to Pickering roads run
 through the region.  Secondary and    
 minor roads join settlements to each  
 other and to the main roads.  There   
 are a number of private roads leading 
 to farms and dispersed homes and the  
 private schools.                      
   There are two bus routes through the
 region one to Whitby and one to       
 Goathland, Pickering and Malton.  One 
 of the functions of the service is to 
 transport children over 11 to Eskdale 
 and Whitby schools.                   
   Few people use the bus service to   
 get to work.  There is much use of    
 private and company cars.  As a result
 of this, very few people use the bus  
 service regularly.                    
   The services are run by the United  
 Bus Company.
