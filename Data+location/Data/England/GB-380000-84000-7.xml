		<title>07ROE AND SIKA DEER</title>
		<content> Nearby are Oakley Wood and West Wood. 
 They are traditional Dorset Woods of  
 Hazel and Oak.The Hazel was once used 
 for spars in thatching or made into   
 sheep hurdles.                        
 The trees are also damaged by deer    
 rubbing their antlers against the     
 trunks.The deer do this when they are 
 growing new antlers which are covered 
 with an itchy'velvet'.Sika Deer were  
 first brought to Brownsea Island,in   
 Poole Harbour from Japan,some escaped 
 by swimming to the mainland.Because   
 there are so many deer a man comes    
 from London each year to 'cull'the    
 deer.This means shooting deer that are
 too old or ill.                       
 Game_keepers look after Pheasants and 
 other wild life in the woods.Owls;Jays
 Chaffinch;Magpies;Robins;Blue and     
 Lomg_tailed Tits are in the woods.    
 Twice a year the Fox Hunt meets.      </content>
