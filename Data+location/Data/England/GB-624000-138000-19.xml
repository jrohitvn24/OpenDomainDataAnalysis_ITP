		<title>19CHURCH HOUGHAM</title>
		<content>   Church Hougham is very small,having 
 no more than twenty houses,half of    
 which are very old.Some date back to  
 at least the 16th century.            
   The day we went to Church Hougham a 
 man was going to each house in turn   
 and  explaining that should the       
 Channel Tunnel be built it will go    
 about 500 feet below their homes!     
   Doctor's Lane is the only road in   
 the village but it branches off,one   
 part leads to St.Laurence's Church and
 the other to the old school,which is  
 now a private house.Near the church is
 the well house and we were able to see
 down a hole just how deep the well is.
   Church Hougham stands on an ancient 
 highway,first used by the Beaker      
 People who walked from Plum Pudding   
 Hill in Dover through Hougham and     
 Capel to Holy Well in Folkestone.
