		<title>06The Gamekeeper</title>
		<content> On Monday afternoon we went to        
 Scarcliffe Woods.We went to a         
 gamekeepers house.The gamekeeper said 
 that he kept one thousand six hundred 
 pheasant chicks.He fed them on        
 crumbs,pellets and grit.He became a   
 gamekeeper in 1936 part_time and 1950 
 full_time.The gamekeeper starts work  
 at 0530 hrs.He is seventy five years  
 old but does not want to retire from  
 his job.His birds are kept  in a      
 shed.He said that foxes and cats are a
 problem.On the Thursday up to         
 Christmas they hold a Christmas       
 Shoot.It is very exciting.On the way  
 back to school we saw two hares.One   
 was running and the other was sitting 
 down.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
