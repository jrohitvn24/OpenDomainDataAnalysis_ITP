		<content>On Tuesday nights during term time     
there is a Youth Club in school for the
lower school, and one for seniors on   
Thursdays. Lots of pupils go because   
there are not many things to do at     
night. If it is cold and rainy you     
can't just walk around the streets. Not
many can afford the 90p for an hour at 
the Sports centre, so the 20p for club 
is cheap. Parents and teachers provide 
table tennis, bar billiards, badminton,
games such as chess and telvision, and 
a tuck shop. We could do with more     
clubs Most nights there is a Boys' Club
next to Woodnewton Way school but the  
discos on Wednesdays cause a lot of    
fights so a lot of rough boys gather   
there. Other nights it starts late     
because Cubs meet there, but they have 
only a snooker &amp; pool table.There are  
not many things for young people to do 
at night except walk the streets.      </content>
