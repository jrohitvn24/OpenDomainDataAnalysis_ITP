		<content> Our area is mainly country side. Some 
 people are{trying}to{save land}for    
 wild life by{planting trees}and{      
{building ponds}for{ducks}and{waterlife
  A farmer called{Mr Farnsworth}is     
 making a{badger set}and{planting}some 
 more{trees}in his {wood.}Instead of   
 taking all the hedges down to make his
{field}bigger. He is keeping them up so
 that{insects}and{wild flowers}can     
{grow.}Mr Farnsworth is also making    
{ponds}in his{wood}for{creatures }like{
{frogs,newts,herons}and{kingfishers,}  
 which will also make nests there.Not  
 many people in our country side are   
 planting {oak}trees because they take 
 a couple of hundred years to  grow to 
 their full size,but Mr Farnsworth as  
 planted some in his wood .They will   
 be there in a few hundred years time  
 When Mr Farnsworth dies,his sons will 
 take over and look after the wood.    </content>
