		<title>14BENENDEN WEALD, LABOUR.</title>
		<content> When Forest Farm was bought in 1946   
 its 28 hectares were farmed by the    
 farmer and his wife with the help of a
 prisoner of war. The labour intensity 
 therefore was 1 person:9.4 hectares.  
 By 1976 the farm had increased to 120 
 hectares and the farmer's two sons    
 were employed in charge of the dairy  
 management and machinery maintenance  
 and management. The farmer does the   
 buying, selling and milling and his   
 wife helps with the book-keeping and  
 also looks after the calves. A student
 helps with the afternoon milking. The 
 farm has now increased to 160 hectares
 and a tractor driver is employed.     
 Although the labour force has         
 increased the larger size of the farm 
 means that the labour intensity is now
 reduced to 1 person :2.3 hectares as a
 result of mechanization.
