		<content> Communities are isolated, either      
 grouped around farms or near an old   
 manor house.  The largest community is
 in Upper Upham.  Home life in this    
 area is ruled by motor transport.     
 Daily routine includes taking the     
 children to school, shopping and      
 travelling to and from work.  All     
 visits to doctors, dentists, etc. have
 to be made by car.  There is no public
 transport at all and only             
 one main road crosses the area.  A    
 postal delivery is the only service   
 available and a private telephone is  
 extremely important.  No gas is       
 available so cooking and heating is   
 fueled by other forms of energy       
 (usually electricity or solid fuel).  
 Entertainment in the home is usually  
 via television, radio, video or books.
 Gardening is also an important form of
 recreation.                           </content>
