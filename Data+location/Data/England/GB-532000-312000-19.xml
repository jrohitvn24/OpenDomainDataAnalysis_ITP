		<title>19TRANSPORT HOLBEACH DROVE</title>
		<content> TRANSPORT IS VERY BUSY IN THE AREA    
 ESPECIALLY ON THE MAIN THROUGH ROAD TO
 HOLBEACH WHICH RUNS THROUGH THE       
 HOLBEACH DROVE VILLAGE. MANY LORRIES  
 GO ALONG THIS ROAD AS IT IS THE MAIN  
 ROUTE FOR THE NORFOLK LINE LORRIES    
 WHICH HAVE THEIR DEPOT LOCALLY. THIS  
 MAKES THE MAIN ROAD QUITE NOISY TO    
 LIVE ON AND THE PETS HAVE TO TAKE     
 EXTRA CARE! MOST RESIDENTS HAVE ONE OR
 TWO CARS AND ALTHOUGH THERE IS A BUS  
 ROUTE, THEY PREFER TO DRIVE THEMSELVES
 TO EITHER WORK OR SHOPPING OR SOCIALLY
 OUT. ALSO CHILDREN HAVE TO BE TAKEN TO
 SCHOOL AND SCHOOL BUSES DO NOT RUN TO 
 ALL SCHOOLS AVAILABLE TO THEM. THE    
 AREA IS QUITE BUSY FOR AIRCRAFT AND IT
 IS NOT UNUSUAL TO SEE THE LANCASTER   
 THE SPITFIRE AND THE HURRICANE FLY    
 OVER TO AIRSHOWS AND THE BOMBERS WHICH
 PRACTICE ON THE LOCAL HOLBEACH MARSH  
 RANGE.                                </content>
