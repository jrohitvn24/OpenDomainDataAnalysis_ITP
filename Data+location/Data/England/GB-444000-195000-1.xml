		<content>                                       
  MARCHAM is a small village in the    
Thames valley. It has a population     
of 1673 today, and has grown           
a lot since the end of the Second      
World War. There are several new       
estates built on the north and         
east of the original village.          
                                       
  The village appears in the Domesday  
Book under the name of {Merceham}:     
"The Abbey of Abingdon itself holds    
Merceham.  A church is there...and a   
mill." A church is still there, as is  
the mill. In our research for this     
program we talked to the vicar and     
visited the mill; the church is still  
central to the life of the village,    
and we could still see the bones of    
the 1086 village of Merceham showing   
through the 1986 village of Marcham.
