		<content> The main road between Accrington,     
 Church and Blackburn is the A679(T),  
 more commonly known as "Blackburn     
 Road".  It used to be a "Turnpike     
 Road", which is a road built or       
 improved by a group of businessmen.   
 In the late l8th/19th centuries it was
 no more than a dirt track, but the    
 businessmen employed people such as   
 John McAdam, to improve the quality of
 the road.  Obviously, this venture was
 costly, so they charged tolls (fees)  
 at the ends of the road.  The money   
 went to maintaining the road and      
 probably a small profit!  Evidence of 
 the old Turnpike Road is at Intack,   
 where there is a round building called
 the "Toll Bar Inn".{
