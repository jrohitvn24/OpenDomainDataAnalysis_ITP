		<title>15Williton Station</title>
		<content>    For the last eight years the{West  
{Somerset Railway Company}has been     
 running the longest privately owned   
 railway in Great Britain.   This      
 Railway line runs the three kilometre 
 squares in the West of this block.    
    At{Williton Station}there is a     
 signal box, goods shed and siding and 
 a shop in the Station that is open    
 during peak holiday times.            
   The most interesting of these items 
 is probably the{Signal Box.}This is   
 a good example of the type known as   
 the{Bristol and Exeter Railway box.   
 It has 25 levers but no gate wheel so 
 the gates over the litle used lane at 
 the side have to be opened by hand.   
 The Railway Company use this Station  
 as one of thier Principal depots for  
 the maintenance of the Permanent way  
 and for the signals departments.
