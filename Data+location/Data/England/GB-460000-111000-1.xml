		<content>     This 4x 3 Km. grid is a rural area
 in the south east of Hampshire to the 
 east of the River Meon. Approximately 
 half the grid is in Newtown parish,   
 part of the civil parish of Soberton. 
 The remainder is shared by Hambledon, 
 Denmead, North Boarhunt and a small   
 part of Southwick. For convenience    
 we have called it Newtown area.       
 The north east corner is on Upper     
 Chalk with gravel deposits. A band of 
 Reading beds runs through the area    
 but about half is London Clay. There  
 is a stream with its associated gravel
 and alluvium running north to south.  
 Most of the clay beds were originally 
 forested and a large proportion is    
 still wooded with the Forestry        
 Commission owning about one sixth of  
 our block.                            
 Traditionally Portsmouth is the city  
 which this area turns to.             </content>
