		<content> MY NAME IS LISA McCARTHY  AND I AM 11 
 YEARS OLD.  THERE ARE 6 PEOPLE IN MY  
 FAMILY, MUM, DAD, TWO SISTERS, A      
 BROTHER AND MYSELF. MY DAD IS A       
 CARPENTER WHO WORKS FOR HIMSELF AND   
 EMPLOYS OTHER MEN. MY MUM WORKS IN THE
 FIELDS AT VARIOUS TIMES OF THE YEAR   
 HARVESTING THE CROPS SUCH AS ONIONS,  
 CABBAGE OR LETTUCE.  IN THE SUMMER WE 
 ALL GO DOWN TO THE BEACH NEARBY.  WE  
 ALL GET ON WELL TOGETHER BUT LIKE MOST
 FAMILIES WE DO HAVE ARGEMENTS.  WE ALL
 HAVE DAILY CHORES TO DO.  MINE ARE TO 
 KEEP MY ROOM TIDY, TO WALK THE DOG AND
 TO WASH AND WIPE THE DISHES.  MY      
 ELDEST SISTER IS THIRTEEN AND SHE DOES
 A PAPER DELIVERY ROUND TO EARN HER    
 POCKET MONEY. SHE ALSO BABY SITS FOR  
 OUR NEIGHBOUR.  WE DO LOTS OF THINGS  
 TOGETHER SUCH AS WALKING, SHOPPING,   
 DAY TRIPS OUT AND DIFFERENT SPORTS.
