		<title>15A Child's View of Maltby</title>
		<content> Looking through the front door of my  
 school straight across the road, I can
 see the village war memorial. This    
 monument is in memory of the men who  
 died during the First and Second World
 Wars.It is situated in a lovely spot  
 because the rocks,fields and woods of 
 the Crags can be seen behind it. Down 
 in a hollow to the west of the        
 memorial,I can see the parish church  
 of St.Bartholomew with houses         
 clustered around it.                  
 Behind the parish church is a busy    
 main road that leads from Rotherham   
 through Maltby to Gainsborough and    
 Lincolnshire. On the far side of this 
 road is a row of houses and the       
 Comprehensive School,which is         
 surrounded by large trees. These trees
 stretch high up the hillside. On the  
 horizon can be seen the outskirts of  
 Rotherham.The M18 crosses the view.   </content>
