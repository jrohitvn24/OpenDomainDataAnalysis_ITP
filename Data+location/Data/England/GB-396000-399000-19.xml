   The reason the Roman roads ran on   
 the high uplands and round the crest  
 of the hillsides, was the far         
 different picture the valley would    
 have presented at that time. Thick    
 forests of oak, elm, beech, ash, and  
 hazel extensively covered the valley. 
 The name {Micklehurst }meaning 'little
 wood' was the name originally applied 
 to the dispersed settlement of {Higher
{Micklehurst,}just below the paved     
 Roman Road, which is the extent of the
 tree-line to-day, as it would also    
 have been at that time. On the eastern
 side of the valley too, the main      
 settlement would be dispersed around  
 the present {Upper Mossley }area.
