		<content>   Blackfield and Langley together form
 a large settlement in the parish of   
 Fawley. To the west of the parish lies
 the New Forest,to the south the West  
 Solent,to the east Southampton Water  
 and to the north the parish of Dibden.
 The parish of Fawley has its own      
 parish council and is one of the      
 richest parishes in England.It is     
 within the New Forest District        
 Council &amp; is administered by Hampshire
 County Council.                       
   Seventy years ago Fawley was        
 predominatly rural with scattered     
 farms and large country estates.      
 Blackfield is a relatively new        
 settlement but Langley is recorded in 
 the Domesday Book as having two       
 tenements held by the king's thegns.  
 The Victoria County History describes 
 the area of Blackfield as a "moor"    
 with mud cottages at first erected.   </content>
