		<title>07tourism in Saffron Walden</title>
		<content>                                       
 There are a lot of tourists in Saffron
 Walden. We do not have anything big   
 and important like the colleges in    
 Cambridge or the Tower of London.     
 People come to Saffron Walden to see  
 what a small traditional market town  
 looks like. We do have the largest    
 parish church in Essex. Apart from    
 this people like to walk around the   
 narrow streets in the centre of the   
 town. They look at the timber-framed  
 buildings in the old part especially  
 the ones with jettied upper stories   
 sticking out. The area is also famous 
 for pargetting (next page).The more   
 the town's population expands the less
 it is like what they imagine old      
 market towns to be. It must be boring 
 to see so many estate agents and      
 building societies.
