		<content>    ON 16TH MAY 1985 MY CLASS DID A    
 QUESTIONNAIRE AT THE ARNDALE SHOPPING 
 CENTRE.WE INTERVIEWED 30 PEOPLE AND   
 WHEN WE GOT BACK TO SCHOOL WE MADE    
 GRAPHS TO SHOW THE RESULTS OF OUR     
 QUESTIONAIRE.NEARLY ALL THE PEOPLE    
 INTERVIEWED SAID "THEY USED SAFEWAYS  
 SUPERMARKET."THIS WAS THE MOST POPULAR
 SHOP.12 PEOPLE USED THE POST OFFICE   
 REGULAR.WE FOUND OUT THAT SOME OTHERS 
 FACILITIES ARE NEEDED.MOST PEOPLE SAID
 "THERE SHOULD BE A CAFE AND SOME      
 PUBLIC TOILETS."LOTS OF PEOPLE WANTED 
 TO SEE MORE FLOWERS AND TWO PEOPLE    
 THOUGHT ANOTHER PUB WAS NEEDED.I THINK
 THERE SHOULD BE SOME MORE CONVENIENT  
 PLACES TO PARK CARS AND ALSO SOME SAFE
 PLACES FOR PARENTS TO LEAVE CHILDREN  
 WHILST THEY ARE SHOPPING.
