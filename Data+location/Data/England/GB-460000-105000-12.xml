		<content> The main local problems are: Access   
 and mobility for the disabled, lack of
 leisure facilities, cuts in school    
 funds and fewer policemen "on the     
 beat" preventing petty crimes.        
 She feels that during her lifetime    
 people have lost faith in each other  
 and there has been a lessening of     
 respect of men for women due to the   
 equality of the sexes.                
 She hopes that her family will be able
 to find work and that they will be    
 happy.  She wants to see more chances 
 for everyone and world peace.
