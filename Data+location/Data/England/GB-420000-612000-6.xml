		<title>06DENWICK HAMLET CHURCH.</title>
		<content> Denwick Church was built in the late  
 19th century because the villagers    
 wanted a church of their own away from
 Alnwick.It is probably{one of the     
{newest buildings}in the village and   
 its opening was marked by{a photograph
{of notable villagers}which still hangs
 in the church.It is a very simple     
 stone built church with a sturdy      
 wooden door.Although it is not        
 dedicated to a particular saint,one of
 the small,gothic stained glass windows
 commemorates{St.Anne.}The furniture is
 very simple;rush seated chairs,a small
 altar  and no pulpit.{Mrs.Dixon }     
 remembered a time when the villagers  
 had to be in Church{before}the bell   
 started ringing in order to get a     
 seat, but now the Vicar is happy that 
 there are usually{8-10}in his         
{fortnightly}congregation.
