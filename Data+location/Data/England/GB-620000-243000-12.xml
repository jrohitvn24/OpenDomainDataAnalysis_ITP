   Ipswich is quite a large town with a
population of over 130,000.  It lies at
the head of the River Orwell.  It has a
dock where ships can  load  and  unload
their cargo.  It  also  has a very good
shopping centre and a  large Town Hall.
Ipswich  has  a First Division football
team  that  has  a  very  good football
pitch.                                 
   There  are  also  many  factories in
Ipswich.  Ransomes  is  an  engineering
firm  and  Churchmans  makes cigarettes
and cigars.   Many  of  the  people who
live in  the  houses  and  bungalows in
Kesgrave  work in these factories.  Two
large insurance  companies  have  their
main   offices   in  Ipswich,  together
employing about 3000 people.           
   To the east of  Ipswich is  Rushmere
Heath with its  golf course which is in
the Kesgrave area.                     </content>
