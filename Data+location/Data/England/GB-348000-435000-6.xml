		<content>The village sports day takes place     
early in June of each year on the field
next to the Village Hall, which is on  
the northern edge of the area, where   
the main road crosses the railway line.
                                       
This year the afternoon began with the 
crowning of the Rose Queen from St     
Lawrence's Church and the Sport's Queen
from St Mary's School by the wives of  
the headmasters of the two schools.    
This was followed by a performance of  
country and disco dancing by children  
from both schools.                     
                                       
There were various races for the       
children during the afternoon before   
tea in the Village Hall. There was also
a fancy dress competition.             
                                       
In the evening a family disco dance was
held in the Village Hall.              </content>
