		<content>Saint Peter's lies about half a mile   
east of the main settlement of         
Whitfield. The plan is the rare 3      
compartment: nave, chancel and apse to 
which a north aisle, porch and vestry  
have been added. The church had        
alterations and renovations in the C13 
and 1894. Being restored again in 1972,
when the furniture was renewed and the 
altar moved from the east to the north,
to allow greater viewing.              
The bell was restored within the last  
20 years, reputedly the oldest in Kent.
The unique wooden cross was carved by a
local man of River, as was the lecturn.
The church acquired a single manual    
organ in 1979, originally built in     
Scotland.                              
The vicar is Reverend John Philpott.   
Two services are held on Sunday, 9.15  
a.m. and 6.60 p.m.                     
                                       </content>
