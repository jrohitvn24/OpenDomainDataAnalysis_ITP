		<title>10PYEFLEET OYSTERS/COLCHESTER</title>
		<content> Colchester has been famous for oysters
 since Roman times.The waters at       
 Pyefleet Channel are warm and shallow 
 and the mud is rich in algae and      
 plankton,on which the oysters feed.The
 Pyefleet Channel is the property of   
 Colchester Borough Council,who in the 
 twelth century bought it from         
 Richard I,who was raising money for   
 the Crusades.The Colne Oyster Fishery 
 Company rent it from them.            
 Every year in September the Mayor of  
 Colchester visits the Pyefleet,going  
 out in a dredger to dredge up the     
 first of the season's oysters.        
 Even more famous is the Oyster Feast  
 at which the Mayor presides and to    
 which local and national dignitaries  
 are invited.Oysters from the Pyefleet 
 form an important item of the menu.
