 seven windows and eight doors.The     
 windows are narrow and open at the    
 top.The floors downstairs are made    
 out of cement,those upstairs from     
 wood.I live in an end terraced        
 house.At the front of my house there  
 is a garden,a path leads up the       
 garden.The garden has ten different   
 kinds of flowers and shrubs. They are
