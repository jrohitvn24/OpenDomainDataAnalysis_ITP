		<title>14THE COMMON, HENFIELD -2-.</title>
		<content>   On the Common there is an area of   
 woodland with a small stream flowing  
 along. There is also a part called the
 Causeway, this has slightly raised    
 banks either side of a ditch.  One of 
 the first things I saw was a large    
 brown frog.  There were three or four 
 fragrant orchids which are quite rare 
 but we didn't pick them because it is 
 against the law as they are protected.
  There were ladybirds.  In the ditch  
 there were different creatures        
 including tadpoles, pond skaters,     
 water-boatmen, dragonflies and small  
 frogs.  There were many different     
 trees to be seen including ash, oak,  
 holly, bramble hawthorn, maple, silver
 birch and ivy.                        
   Wild life abounds mainly undisturbed
 apart from the traffic which races by.
 It is a very beautiful place and we in
 the village are proud of it.          </content>
