		<content> The office has no cell either so      
 arrested people have to be taken      
 direct to Crowborough.As elsewhere    
 Crime is increasing &amp; the most        
 frequent crime in Mayfield is day_time
 burglary.There is also a small but    
 growing drug problem &amp; driving &amp;      
 traffic offences are also common.     
 Mayfield was chosen as one off the    
 pilot 'Crime Watch' villages in       
 Sussex,&amp; this is still in operation.  
 There are three 'co_ordinators' in    
 Mayfield,well_known &amp; knowledgable    
 people whom the villagers are         
 encouraged to contact in              
 non_emergencies &amp; advice.These        
 co_ordinators then contact the Police 
 who deal with the problems/enquiries  
 as soon as possible.Crime Watch was   
 designed to encourage the Public to   
 assist the Police &amp; so far has worked 
 well.                                 </content>
