		<title>06Mixed Farming in Cumbria</title>
		<content> The l5 farms in this block all have   
 Friesian dairy herds and beef cattle, 
 mainly Charolais and Limousins, and   
 half of them have sheep.   A few breed
 sheep or buy and resell fat lambs, but
 most just provide winter grazing.     
 Breeds include Cheviots, Grey faced   
 and Suffolks.   One farmer keeps a few
 pigs.   Some wives keep hens or fatten
 turkeys for Christmas.                
                                       
 About 10 of the farms grow between 5  
 and 30 acres of barley.   All the     
 farms make hay and/or silage for      
 winter feed; perhaps half the total   
 acreage is used for silage.Large farms
 have silage pits, smaller ones make   
 bales which are bagged in black       
 polythene.     3 farms grow turnips   
 and some are trying out Tyfon, a new  
 turnip/cabbage used as a catch crop   
 with rye.                             </content>
