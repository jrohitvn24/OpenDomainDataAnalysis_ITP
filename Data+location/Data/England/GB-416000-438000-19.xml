 opposite Brackendale Mill,but damp and
 the house being too big for her forced
 her to move to a bungalow near        
 Thackley tunnel.She has been there for
 5 years now.

{She said}I was born and raised up here
 in Thackley.I like it here because I  
 am near most of my relatives and it's 
 a clean quiet area.I chose to live in 
 my bungalow because the neighbours are
 friendly and also it is handy for     
 Basil (my dog) and me,because the     
 woods are just nearby.I like to walk, 
 it's very peaceful.I have enjoyed     
 living here and I think I will die    
 here.
