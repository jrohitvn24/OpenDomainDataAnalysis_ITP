		<title>10Longnor Watermill</title>
		<content>     The watermill in Longnor is owned 
by Philip Kidd.                        
     The age of the mill is not known  
but it is thought to have been a button
factory to start with.                 
     It is built of sandstone ripping  
and used to have three storeys but a   
fire in the 1920s destroyed the top    
storey.  The fire is thought to have   
been started by some gypsies.          
     The mill stands on the River      
Manifold which is dammed up with       
sandstone about 200 metres up stream.  
From the mill dam a mill race stretches
to the mill.  It is about 2 metres wide
near the dam and 6 metres wide near the
mill.  It was dug out by a hy mac when 
Mr. Kidd took over the mill because it 
had been silted up.  There are two     
outlets along the mill race, one of    
which is called the Treacle Spout.  The
wall of the mill race is leaking.      </content>
