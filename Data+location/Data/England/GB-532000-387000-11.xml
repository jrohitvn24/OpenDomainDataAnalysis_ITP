		<content> For the project we completed a survey 
 on the life style of the local people.
   Firstly we interviewed fifty people 
 in the street to find out about the   
 facilities they have in their         
 homes.Our results showed that 96% of  
 the people interviewed have a garden  
 and 70% have a garage.It was          
 surprising that only 63% have central 
 heating but everyone we interviewed   
 has a television.Many people in Louth 
 own a video,50% and a stereo 78%.Very 
 few people own luxury items such as   
 dishwashers 18% and microwaves 26%.   
   Next we interviewed local boutiqes  
 proprietors and hairstylists to       
 discover the fashions of 1985.The     
 popular colours are pastel shades of  
 pink,blue,yellow and green.Designs    
 tend to be loose and baggy with large 
 floral prints.Bobs and short spiky    
 cuts are the current trends.       o. </content>
