Close to the Essex and Cambridgeshire  
borders lies the Suffolk village of    
Cowlinge and the tiny hamlet of Little 
Bradley. The main street in Cowlinge is
lined with a mixture of very old or    
very new houses and cottages, and the  
whole area has a scattering of both    
farm houses and cottages. It has one   
public house, one post office, one     
shop, a church and a telephone box. The
whole of which is surrounded by arable 
farmland. Little Bradley lies approx.  
three kilometres to the south-east and 
now consists of one farm house and its 
attendant workers' cottages. There is a
public telephone here. Nearest towns   
are Haverhill and Newmarket, each      
approx eight miles away and Bury St.   
Edmunds fifteen miles away.
