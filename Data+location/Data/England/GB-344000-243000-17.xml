		<content>   FIONA AND SARAH INTERVIEWED MRS.    
 JOSEPH OUR SCHOOL CARETAKER WHO HAS   
 LIVED HERE FOR 27 YEARS. HER HUSBAND  
 WAS BORN IN THE VILLAGE AND WENT TO   
 OUR SCHOOL. IT WAS THEN THE OLD       
 BUILDING WITH TWO CLASSROOMS. THE     
 CHILDREN WENT TO THE R.A.F. CAMP FOR  
 LESSONS WHILE THE NEW SCHOOL WAS BEING
 BUILT TO CATER FOR THE INCREASING     
 NUMBERS IN 1974.                      
   SHE REMEMBERS THE RAILWAY STATION   
 USED BY THE R.A.F. AND VILLAGERS UNTIL
 IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TO BE CLOSED  
 BY DR. BEECHING IN THE LATE FIFTIES.  
   THERE WERE NO SHOPS, GARAGE, STREET 
 LIGHTS OR POST OFFICE UNTIL THE       
 1960'S. PEOPLE WENT TO TOWN BY DOUBLE 
 DECKER BUS FROM THE ONLY BUS STOP.    
   MRS. JOSEPH BOUGHT TWO COTTAGES IN  
 1957 FOR Â£900 AND MERGED THEM INTO    
 ONE. SHE DOESN'T KNOW THEIR AGE       
 BECAUSE THERE ARE NO DEEDS.           </content>
