		<title>15ENGINEERING - DERWENT VALLEY</title>
		<content>   This small firm has its business at 
 Blackhall Mill, south of the River    
 Derwent. It has a total work-force of 
 three but hopes to expand. It began as
 a blacksmith's in 1896. One employee  
 has been there almost 19 years.       
   They work 8:00a.m. to 4:30p.m. five 
 days a week. Handrails, gates, and    
 tracks for carrying invalid carriages 
 upstairs are some of the articles     
 manufactured from mild steel.         
 Producing a gate may take three hours.
 The biggest job tackled yet is a      
 4-storey fire-escape, so travelling is
 involved. Welding is also done. Tools 
 used, including hammers, jacks and    
 knives, are all handmade. Electric    
 machines are also used.               
   The men enjoy their skilled trade   
 and must wear special clothing;       
 goggles, ear muffs, leather aprons and
 safety shoes.                         </content>
