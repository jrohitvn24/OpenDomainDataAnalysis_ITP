There has been a bakery in Leiston for 
the past 150 years.  The present       
bakery is Smith's bakery.  They bake   
different kinds of cakes, bread and    
rolls.  At Smith's bakery they use     
yeast and warm water to make the rolls 
rise.  To make the rolls you have to   
make them the right way.  During the   
summer Smith's make up to 4,000 rolls a
day for all the visitors to Leiston.   
To make the doughnuts they put the     
dough in to a prover to see if it is   
ready to fry.  When it is they put the 
doughnuts in to a fat fryer and fry    
them in it for exactly for 4 minutes.  
Then the tray is raised up and the     
doughnuts are allowed to cool.  Then   
they are taken over to the jam machine 
which squirts the jam into the         
doughnuts by means of a hollow tube.   
 Sugar is sprinkled over the doughnuts.</content>
