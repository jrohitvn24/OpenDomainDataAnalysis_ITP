		<title>04Newcastle Eldon Square</title>
		<content>    It was{built in 1976}on the Eldon  
 Square site named after one of        
 Newcastle's famous sons, Lord Eldon.  
 It is the{largest{shopping centre in  
{Western Europe.}                      
    It has every kind of shop ranging  
 from coffee bars to department stores 
 and an indoor market (Green Market).  
 Its indoor streets are designed with  
 space for sitting around fountains,   
 design set pieces and open cafes and  
 there are large street maps. It closes
 overnight. It has a bus station, a    
 Metro interchange and two car parks.  
    About{12m shoppers}use it every    
 year from a catchment including the   
{Borders, Carlisle and the Scandinavian
{ferry links.} Especially at Christmas.
    Future question marks are the{very 
{high rates,}higher than in New Bond   
 Street and competition from the car   
 accessible Dunston, Gateshead scheme. </content>
