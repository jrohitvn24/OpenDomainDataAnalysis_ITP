		<title>05     The Day of Rest.</title>
		<content> It was decided to make a brief study  
of the way in which leisure time has   
changed over the past 25 years. Twenty 
households throughout the area were    
each given a questionnaire which tried 
to ascertain whether or not Sunday has 
changed during the period studied.     
 The sample was tiny but showed        
significant decreases in Sunday School 
attendance (80%),going to the cinema or
theatre (71%),and formal Sunday tea    
(33%). Significant increases included  
shopping (66%) and working on and      
cleaning the car (50%) and (42%)       
respectively. There was a general      
decrease (20-30%) in the cooked        
breakfast,church attendance and        
entertaining visitors.                 
Increases were revealed in             
gardening,D.I.Y work,television viewing
and sleep!However the traditional      
Sunday lunch was as popular as ever.   </content>
