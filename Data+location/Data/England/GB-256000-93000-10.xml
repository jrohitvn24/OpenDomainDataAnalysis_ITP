		<title>10OKEHAMPTON - CRAON TWINNING</title>
		<content> Okehampton is twinned with Craon, in  
 N.W. France. The twinning between the 
 two towns was established in 1977.    
 Each year a party of adults go to     
 Craon, and then adults from Craon come
 here. There is also a pupil exchange  
 organised by the College. French      
 students stay for a fortnight in a    
 family. Students come from Le Prieure,
 a private Catholic school that is     
 twinned with the College. Exchanges   
 have been arranged between the town   
 bands. There are now very strong links
 with Craon, a modern connection with  
 Normandy.                             
 The president of Craon's twinning     
 association is Madame de Guebriand,   
 who lives in the Chateau de Craon.    
 There is a by-pass round Craon called 
 the Boulevard D'Okehampton. What will 
 our by-pass be called? - when it is   
 built!        Sarah Samson            </content>
