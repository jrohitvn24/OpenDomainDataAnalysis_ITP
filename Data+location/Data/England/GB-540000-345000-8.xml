		<content> Many people who live in the village   
 still carry on the old customs of     
 cockling,eating {samphire }and stuffed
 chine.The cockles are gathered from   
 the outmarsh at low tide in           
 sacks,brought home,boiled and either  
 eaten straight away or pickled in     
 vinegar.The{samphire }is also picked  
 at low tide in the autumn on  those   
 parts of the outmarsh which are       
 regularly covered by the tide as this 
 is considered to be the best.It is    
 washed,boiled and served with vinegar 
 as a sort of poor man's asparagus.It  
 is very much an acquired taste.Stuffed
 chine is also an autumn custom and    
 dates from the times when people      
 killed the family pig before          
 winter.The chine is stuffed with      
 parsley and boiled.It is eaten cold   
 with ham and usually a good sprinkling
 of vinegar.                           </content>
