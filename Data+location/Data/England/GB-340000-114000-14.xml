{OVER STRATTON}is in the South East    
 corner of our 'D' block.I live at Over
 Stratton.Over Stratton is about 1     
 kilometre long.There is a Methodist   
 church and a pub called the Royal Oak.
 There is a post office/general stores.
 Every year the May Fair is held at    
 Stratton house which belongs to the   
 Gaminaraas. Many orchards surround the
 village and they make a nice walk.    
{LOPEN}is a small village in the South 
 of the 'D' block. It has no shops but 
 there is a cattle feed mill there. {  
{SEAVINGTON ST.MICHAEL &amp; ST.MARY}are   
 two villages in the South West of our 
 'D'block. There is a pub, sub-Post    
 Office and playing field. Of the two  
 churches, only St.Michael's still     
 holds services.{
