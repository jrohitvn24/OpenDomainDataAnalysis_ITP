		<content> Tameside Metropolitan Borough. New    
 industries have replaced the old in   
 the form of chemical and engineering  
 works, unfortunately on a much smaller
 scale.New residential developments now
 occupy the valley. However, with the  
 help of Green Belt and conservation   
 policies the essential character of   
 Mossley remains and the town continues
 to expand albeit as a dormitory town  
 for the larger towns in the Greater   
 Manchester area. Although Mossley is  
 the principal population centre in the
 block, most of it is composed of open 
 moorland with the lower areas being   
 used for rough grazing. In the Valley 
 bottom by the River Tame and the      
 Huddersfield Narrow Canal, the main   
 features are the familiar signs of the
 relics of a once thriving cotton and  
 woollen town.
