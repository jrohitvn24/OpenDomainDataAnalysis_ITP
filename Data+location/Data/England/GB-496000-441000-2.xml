		<content> Group activities in C.Burton take     
 place in various locations.In a       
 village of 1345 residents,the average 
 Sunday congregation is over 100 (the  
 largest gathering of residents).At    
 festivals every pew is taken.The      
 church has a firm place in village    
 life with a Sunday school,Bible study 
 group,Pathfinders,pram services and a 
 monthly village newsletter.The Summer 
 fete,held at C.B. House,is well       
 supported by over half the residents. 
 The school and the Bay Horse pub are  
 geographically the most central       
 meeting places,though for rather      
 different functions! The school holds 
 events such as the annual summer fair 
 and Christmas Crackers,both being fund
 raising events.The Parish Council,WEA,
 Yoga class and other evening groups   
 also use the school.Self Help and     
 social groups use the public house.   </content>
