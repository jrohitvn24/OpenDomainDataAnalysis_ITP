		<content>  {The Bending Tree }                  
                                       
     The bending tree was given that   
 name because it was used for bending  
 the metal hoops which were used to put
 on the wheels of the carts. Outside   
 the forge is a big flat stone . This  
 was used for clamping down the wheels 
 while two blacksmiths put the red hot 
 hoops on with iron tongs.             
                                       
                                       
  {Agricultural Use Of Land}           
                                       
     Most of the land in and around    
 Finchdean is pasture and grazing land 
 but there are some crops and potatoes.
 In the rough grazing there are        
 Charollais and a mixed breed of       
 Friesian and Hereford cows.           
     At the top of{White Hill}there is 
 a group of deciduous trees.           </content>
