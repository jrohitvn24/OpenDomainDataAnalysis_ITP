		<title>14CALLESTICK PEOPLE, TRURO.</title>
		<content> The population of Callestick includes 
 farmers,a builder, a doctor, solicitor
 and several retired people.           
  One retired gentleman's time is fully
 occupied caring for his \ acre garden 
 growing flowers, fruit and vegetables 
 enough for his family, and by D.I.Y.  
 maintenance on the attractive old     
 stone house:never-ending re-decoration
 &amp; repairs, "like the Forth Bridge". He
 enjoys weekly lunch with Perranzabuloe
 Rotary Club, occasionally goes to the 
 Plume of Feathers pub or out for a    
 meal with his wife (teacher in Truro).
 They go to Church at Perranzabuloe. He
 enjoys an extended lunch-hour, reading
 newspapers, and watches television in 
 the evening. This month he has chopped
 wood from a neighbour's dead elm trees
 for open fires during the winter &amp; has
 bought sausages &amp; bacon in bulk from a
 factory to store in the deep-freeze.  </content>
