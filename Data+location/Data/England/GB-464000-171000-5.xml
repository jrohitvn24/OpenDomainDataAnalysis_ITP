		<content> The Calcot area is well served for    
 primary and secondary schools.There   
 is,however,increasing pressure for    
 more nursery schools,which number few 
 at present.Playgroups for the under   
 5's go some way towards meeting the   
 local need for pre-school provision.  
    Over the past few years large      
 numbers of children have been passing 
 through the primary school system.    
 Secondary schools are just about to   
 receive this 'bulge'. At this moment  
 in time the pressure to enlarge the   
 area of intake of the two Reading     
 Grammar schools is causing great      
 concern.Parents in this area send     
 their children mainly to the two local
 comprehensive schools, which stand to 
 lose the most able children if the    
 plan goes ahead.
