		<title>17HOUSING IN SOUTH DERBY</title>
		<content> The{housing}in this area is of a      
 variety of ages and architectural     
 styles.  In the outer suburbs the     
 houses are generally large and set in 
 spacious gardens.  The houses in the  
 inner suburban areas were council     
 built just prior to and immediately   
 after second world war.  The{inner    
{city}housing area is a mixture of late
 Victorian terraces, many derelict but 
 many recently modernised, and new     
 terraced houses, flats or maisonettes 
 built in 1984 and 1985.  Among these  
 smaller housing units there are some  
 large detached houses formerly        
 belonging to the church or local      
 business men, which have been         
 converted into flats or bed sitting   
 accommodation for the youth of        
 Derby.There are also occasional       
 bungalows snd purpose built old       
 people's homes.                       </content>
