		<title>05MELKSHAM STATION</title>
		<content> Melksham station was closed in 1966.  
 The Great Western Railway originally  
 owned it.  The line was reopened      
 because of public demand due to       
 traffic congestion on the road to     
 Swindon.  The trains that run are     
 diesel multiple units an the speed    
 limits for them are 75mph on a        
 straight track, and 30mph on a tight  
 bend.  Trains run to Swindon,         
 Chippenham, Trowbridge &amp; Westbury.  If
 many people use the railway then more 
 trains will run.                      
   On May 11 1985 the station reopened.
 A band played as the first train left 
 the station.  Fireworks went off as   
 the train went over them.
