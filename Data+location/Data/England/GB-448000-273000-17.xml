		<title>17RUGBY RAILWAY STATION.</title>
		<content> When th northbound side of Rugby      
 Station opened 100 years ago, more    
 than 120 trains a day passed,only one 
 of which did not stop.In peak seasons,
 goods or mineral trains left at       
 intervals of only 9 mins. through the 
 night.Now Rugby has more than 500     
 train movements every 24 hrs.         
 First proposed in 1825, but opposed by
 canal owners and haulieres,approval   
 was given in 1832 following the       
 introduction of a bill in the House of
 Commons.                              
 Engineered by Robert Stephenson,the   
 London to Birmingham Railway was      
 poened in 1838.This led to a rise in  
 the town's poulation.The present      
 station is the third,Rugby School     
 aiding with the cost of the building. 
 Originally Rugby had direct links with
 Leamington,Leicester,Peterborough and 
 the East Coast.                       </content>
