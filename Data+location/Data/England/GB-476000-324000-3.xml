		<content> Goadby Marwood is a small village on  
 the Northen edge of our block, which  
 has 3 farms, a church, a chapel (once 
 a house) and a village hall (once a   
 school).                              
     There is a Manor House, owned at  
 present by Miss Sheriff and previously
 by the De_Villiers family.            
    {Goadby fish ponds}form part of the
 estate and they are very popular with 
 local anglers, who can fish there by  
 arrangement with the gamekeeper.      
     The ponds are formed naturally but
 they have been enlarged by man.They   
 contain plenty of coarse fish,perch,  
 roach, pike, bream, tench and eel.    
     King fishers and herons can some  
 times be seen. No wonder the tunnels  
 which are a feature of the fishponds  
 are called{Bellamere- beautiful water.
