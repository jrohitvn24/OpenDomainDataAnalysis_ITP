		<content>{   Medicine Pond}is a{mysterious}place
 which has{weird}tales;this is the most
 frightening. One{dark and stormy night
 a man was going to{Whittlesey}to fetch
 help because his wife was dying. The  
 man saw the lights of{Whittlesey.}When
 he got to the house of the{Doctor}it  
 was pouring with rain. He asked the   
{Doctor}if he could come to Thorney,and
 the{Doctor}said"Yes". The{Doctor}said 
 that the man could sleep at his       
 house until morning while he set off  
 along the winding roads and muddy     
 tracks. Eventually he saw the sign    
 that said{Thorney.}Suddenly his horses
 reared up and ran,the{whisky}coach    
 went into the pond that was nearby,and
 the{Doctor}was drowned. All his       
 medicines spilled out, and the pond   
 has been called Medicine Pond ever    
 since. People say that you can still  
 hear the carriage going by.           </content>
