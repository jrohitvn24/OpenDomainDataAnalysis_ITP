		<title>04FARMING IN CODICOTE/WELWYN</title>
		<content>  This area is traditionally a         
 barley growing and malt producing     
 region. Until quite recently cereal   
 production on the higher ground was   
 supplemented by dairy or mixed farming
 in the river valley. However economic 
 factors resulting from the Common     
  Agricultural Policy of the E.E.C.    
 have caused farmers to concentrate on 
  cereals so that today, farming in    
 this area is devoted almost entirely  
 to the growing of barley and wheat.   
 Occasionally rape seed is grown for   
 the production of vegetable oil.      
  Modern agricultural machinery enables
 large farms to be run with a very     
 small labour force. The use of large  
 tractor-ploughs and combine harvesters
 has encouraged the destruction of     
 hedgerows to make larger fields.      
 Modern equipment including grain      
 dryers minimises harvesting delays    </content>
