		<content> This area is predominantly rural and  
 agricultural, despite the fact that   
 there is a very small town of 8000    
 people within this block. Little      
 change has occurred in the village of 
 Huntworth in architectural terms since
 the late 1800s. North Petherton is the
 main town in the block and still has  
 some very old buildings especially the
 parish church which has not changed   
 site in the last 1000 years. There are
 also some very modern new houses being
 built. North Petherton has its own    
 district council and its own mayor.   
 The most important event that happens 
 in North Petherton is the carnival    
 which is an annual event that takes   
 place on the Saturday following the   
 carnival in Bridgwater on the Thursday
 nearest to November 5. The carnival   
 has taken place for nearly 100 years.
