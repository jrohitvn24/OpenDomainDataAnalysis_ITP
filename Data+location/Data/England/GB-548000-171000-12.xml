		<content>   The Cub Scout conservation badge is 
 all about helping animals in danger of
 extinction. Last week we went to      
 Danson Park lake to remove all the    
 fishermans tackle, as a lot of ducks  
 would have their legs caught and      
 injured in their struggle. Last week  
 Scouts used axes &amp; saws to cut logs in
 half. Then we had to pull them off the
 bank and drag them about 100m to the  
 compound. One slip and the bank would 
 come tumbling down. This was in aid of
 the camp fire and seating.            
   Gymnastics clubs and swimming clubs.
 Many people who go to these clubs go  
 every week and work hard both there   
 and at home doing their exercises. It 
 is an enjoyable thing to do if you    
 work hard and do what your coach says 
 but it makes you very tired.
