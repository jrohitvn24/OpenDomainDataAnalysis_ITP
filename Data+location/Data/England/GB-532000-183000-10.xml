		<title>10REGENTS CANAL, LONDON N.1.</title>
		<content>                                       
  Regents canal passes under Whitmore  
Road N.l.  A long time ago it was used 
to carry goods, eg coal and wood.      
  As you walk along the canal you can  
see the warehouses some of which are in
use.  But instead of loading onto      
barges today, goods are loaded onto    
lorries and containers.  Long ago      
children used to swim and bathe in the 
canal but the water isn't very clean   
anymore.                               
  Today ducks and fish can be seen     
swimming in the canal.  People can be  
seen fishing. They look happy and      
 eaceful. There is a Kingsland Basin   
where narrow boats are kept. Hoxton    
Trust are planting flowers along the   
canal side. There is a boat club near  
Laburnum School, and local teachers use
this area with their pupils.
