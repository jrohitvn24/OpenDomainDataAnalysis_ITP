		<title>09The Old Water Mill</title>
		<content>   This old water mill is sited where  
{Dalton Gill}joins{Dalton Beck.}Local  
 corn was ground here until about 1925.
 The large wooden wheel was removed    
 from the east side of the building    
 some 30 years ago but its position can
 still be traced. Barter used to be the
 main means of exchange operating at   
 the time, a half day's threshing      
 labour or some grain, eggs etc. in    
 return for a quantity of ground flour.
                                       
   Millstones were obtained locally    
 possibly from a small quarry by the   
 side of  Dalton Beck. There is also a 
 small field known as{Grindstone Garth,
 where if one looks closely, one can   
 see the remains of old stone archways 
 which formed parts of the{old brewery 
 buildings.
