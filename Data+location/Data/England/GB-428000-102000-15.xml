		<content> When asked about their places of      
 employment it was most interesting to 
 find that {30}of the households had   
 no-one that worked in the village.    
 Brockenhurst is on the main railway   
 line to {London}and it is less than { 
{90 minutes}on the train to the        
 capital. This has resulted in many    
 commuters living in the New Forest and
 especially in Brockenhurst. The oil   
 refinerys at Fawley have also brought 
 an influx of businessmen,engineers and
 scientists to the Brockenhurst area.  
 House prices have risen considerably  
 over the last few years and look set  
 to remain much higher than average for
 the South of England for some time to 
 come.
