		<content>    The stone house which stands at    
 the junction of Lincoln Road and      
 Westcliffe Road was built by a Mr.    
 Barrand, a builder from Bradford in   
 Yorkshire. It is interesting to note  
 that he had all the stone used in its 
 construction brought from his home    
 town, apparently by rail - it was all 
 second hand material!                 
    A certain Mr Frederick Tong (great 
 grandfather of this researcher) was   
 responsible for laying the foundation 
 stones on which the Red Lion public   
 house stands.                         
    Finally, the Mill House on Lincoln 
 Road is one of the few houses in      
 Ruskington to possess a cellar - the  
 rectory also has one.
