		<title>15Houses  (2)</title>
		<content> Some buildings used to be made of     
 sandstone.Most of the{modern houses   
 are built on the end of the older rows
 to make mini-estates.The rest of the  
 modern houses are scattered over      
 Edgmond.                              
     On Friday afternoon{,19th May,1665
 a{terrible fire}broke out in a        
 blacksmiths shop in Newport{.Richard  
{Shelton}owned the shop.It existed     
 between Barclays Bank and Tuckers.It  
 used to be called "The Antelope".The  
 fire was so big that you could see the
 smoke as far away as Woodseaves       
 ,Shifnal ,Oakengates and              
 Wellington.People at Lilleshall       
 stopped their work to watch the       
 disaster. As a result of this few     
 houses from before this period remain.
