		<content> We have to get up for school but first
 we have some breakfast. I sometimes   
 have Frosties,toast and honey and some
 sort of drink,normally lemon squash.  
 Then I have to walk to school,past    
 many shops and houses. My dad has gone
 to work by now. He works at his shop  
 which is next door to our house. We   
 have to be at school by 9.00a.m. and  
 we finish at 3.15p.m. During this time
 we do Maths and English and many other
 subjects. For school dinners you can  
 have a such things as spaghetti       
 Bolognese or fish fingers and chips.  
 There is always a pudding. Our        
 classroom has wooden desks and        
 pictures around the walls. We write   
 with ball point pen,ink pen or pencil.
 During playtimes we play on the       
 playground with our friends. We play  
 ball throwing games. When I get home I
 have my tea and watch T.V. or play.   </content>
