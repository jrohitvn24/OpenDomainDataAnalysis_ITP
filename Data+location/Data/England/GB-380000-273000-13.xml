		<title>13Kidderminster, Brinton's</title>
		<content> Until 1887 the town possessed no large
 public open space. In that year,      
 however, John Brinton, who became the 
 town's greatest benefactor of his     
 generation, acquired the freehold of a
 24 acre site known as Sutton Common,  
 which faced the Stourport and Sutton  
 Roads. He offered to present this to  
 the town, an offer which was          
 gratefully accepted, and on 1st       
 August,1887, the site was formally    
 opened as "The Brinton Park". In 1905 
 an additional 6 acres in Sutton Road  
 became available; this land was       
 purchased by the Council for an       
 addition to Brinton Park, and was     
 opened on 12th May, 1906. In its early
 years the Park was not used to its    
 full capacity, perhaps because the    
 people found it strange to have a park
 of their own.                         
                                       </content>
