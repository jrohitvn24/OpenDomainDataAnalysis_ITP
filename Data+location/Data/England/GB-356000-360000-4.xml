		<content>  Very little is known about the early 
 history of{Tilstone Lodge}but it is   
 believed that it became the manor     
 house of the village after the Hall   
 had finally been demolished in 1736.  
 The first recorded inhabitant was{Vice
{Admiral Tollemache,}who died in 1837. 
  After the Tollemache family left,the 
 Lodge had several owners. The present 
 owners are{Sir Harold and Lady Bibby, 
 who moved there in 1936.Sir Harold was
 formerly chairman of the{Bibby        
{Shipping Line.}                       
  Lady Bibby is a keen gardener and the
 gardens of the Lodge are very well    
 kept,much of the work being done by   
 Lady Bibby herself.They contain many  
 beautiful plants,shrubs and trees,some
 being rare to this country.The gardens
 are open to the public once a year on 
{Whit Sunday.}They have also featured  
 in a television programme.            </content>
