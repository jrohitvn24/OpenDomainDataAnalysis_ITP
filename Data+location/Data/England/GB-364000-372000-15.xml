 "LANDSCAPE",WE WILL LOOK AT"FEATURES".
  THE RIVER WEAVER IS ONE OF THE MAJOR 
 FEATURES OF THE NORTHWICH BLOCK.THE   
 LARGE POOL WHERE THE TRIBUTARY OF THE 
 RIVER DANE MEETS THE MAIN RIVER IS THE
 LOCATION FOR WATER ACTIVITIES SUCH AS 
 RAFT RACES ON CERTAIN DAYS OF THE     
 YEAR.THE RIVER BANKS HAVE BEEN        
 IMPROVED CONSIDERABLY TO PROVIDE      
 PLEASANT WALKING AND RECREATIONAL     
 AREAS.                                
  JUST TO THE SIDE OF THE CONFLUENCE OF
 THE TWO RIVERS IS THE CENTRE OF       
 NORTHWICH,AN AREA KNOWN AS THE "BULL  
 RING".ALTHOUGH DOMINATED BY BANKS AND 
 BUILDING SOCIETIES,THE MAIN FEATURES  
 ARE THE BUILDINGS THEMSELVES.THEY ARE 
 HALF-TIMBERED,BLACK AND WHITE         
 BUILDINGS,AND ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NOT AS
 OLD AS THEY LOOK,THEY PROVIDE A GREAT 
 DEAL OF CHARACTER TO THE TOWN.        </content>
