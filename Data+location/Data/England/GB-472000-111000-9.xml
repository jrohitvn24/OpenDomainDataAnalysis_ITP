    This Victorian house was built in  
 1850 for Sir Jervoise Clarke_Jervoise 
 by the railway company because they   
 had put the line very close to his old
 house.                                
    Recently the estate was sold and   
 the house and outhouses were converted
 into smaller homes.                   
    The best rooms of the original     
 house are still in one home _ the     
 music room,games room,dining          
 room,sitting room,gunroom and         
 library. Upstairs there are many      
 bedrooms and bathrooms. There is an   
 impressive front door and a side door 
 through which the servants took the   
 baggage.                              
    Another home was the servants'     
 section. It contains a passage with 45
 bells.                                </content>
