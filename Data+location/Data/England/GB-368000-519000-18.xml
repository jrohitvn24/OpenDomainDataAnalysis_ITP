		<content>    The bridge is set on the river Eden
 and below Castle Hill and it is next  
 to Bongate Mill.The first bridge was  
 built in 1887 and it was made out of  
 iron and wood.In 1968 flood waters    
 washed it away and in 1970 it was     
 afficialy opened by the Mayor of      
 Appleby.The ford next to the bridge   
 was used as a tractor crossing for    
 vehicles bringing corn to the mill.   
    There are a variety of plants and  
 animals around Jubilee Bridge.In the  
 plant section there are daffodils,    
 daisies and buttercups.The River Eden 
 is well stocked with fish and is well 
 known as a game fishing river.Birds   
 such as herons and coots abound.Small 
 mammals such as squirrels are common. 
    Jubilee Bridge is a favourite place
 for children for swimming,raft        
 building and fishing.   Kevin Winder
