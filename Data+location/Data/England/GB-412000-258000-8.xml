		<title>08Holyoake House</title>
		<content>    I went to Holyoake House and       
 inteviewed Mrs Knox the owner. First  
 she took me into the kitchen where she
 showed me the meat hooks and there was
 one cream hook. Then we went outside  
 the house and Mrs Knox told me that   
 you can tell how wealthy the builder  
 was by how much timber there was in   
 the front of the house. It is a timber
 framed house with wattle and daub     
 infilling. The man who built the house
 was Thomas Holyoake and that was why  
 the house was called Holyoake house.  
 The house was built in 1630.Mr and Mrs
 Knox did not inherit the house they   
 bought it from an agent. They have    
 lived there for three years.It is a   
 small farm with a big farm house split
 into two.Another family live in the   
 other half of the house.
