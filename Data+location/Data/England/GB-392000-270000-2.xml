		<title>02BROMSGROVE HIGH STREET</title>
		<content>   {Bromsgrove High Street}has changed 
 a lot in the last few years. It is now
{pedestrianised}and is a lot safer and 
 quicker to do your shopping. Vans go  
 along the high street to deliver goods
 to the shops. When it wasn't          
 pedestrianised it was very busy and   
 very dangerous.                       
    In the centre of the high street   
 there are two statues, one of the     
 famous poet{A.E.Housman}and one of    
 a dryad and a boar.{Boarsgrave}was    
 supposed to be the name of Bromsgrove 
 a long time ago. That is why the      
 statue was erected.                   
    Many of the buildings in the high  
 street are Georgian, and there are    
 some timber-framed buildings, many of 
 which used to be inns.                
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
