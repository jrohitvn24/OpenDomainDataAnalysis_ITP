		<content>  Did you know that Dymock was         
 mentioned in the first Domesday Survey
 of 1086? This year we are celebrating 
 our church's 900th anniversary. Many  
 events have taken place, including a  
 local pageant. People with the name   
 "Dymock" were invited and they came   
 from all over the world including as  
 far away as Australia and USA! One    
 lady was a descendent of one of the   
 Founding Fathers who went to America  
 in 1634. People dressed up as monks   
 and in medieval costumes. One of the  
 main events was a joust and men       
 dressed in armour entertained us with 
 jousting on horseback and             
 sword-fighting on foot. The school    
 children gave a display of maypole    
 dancing. There was roast pig and lots 
 of beer and wine to drink! One of the 
 Dymocks is the Queen's Champion.
