		<title>03FARMING AROUND OSSINGTON.(2)</title>
		<content>    Farming in this area is generally  
 closely connected with the{hunting and
{shooting fraternity,}and some of the  
 farmers keep horses, none of which are
 now used for working on the land.     
    Approximately one-sixth of this    
 area is made up of{deciduous and      
{coniferous woodland,}and some timber  
 is used from the woods owned by the   
{Forestry Commission}for fencing and   
 mining pit props.                     
    Towards the village of{Laxton}there
 is an area which still maintains the  
{strip-farming practice of the Middle  
{Ages.}Under this system the arable    
 land is divided into three great      
 fields of more than 250 acres each.   
 These are farmed on a three-year      
 rotational basis, one field lies      
 fallow each year and the remaining two
 are divided into strips shared among  
 the farmers.                          </content>
