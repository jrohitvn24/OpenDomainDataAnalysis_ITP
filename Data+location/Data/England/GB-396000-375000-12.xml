		<content> Thus the stagnant layer is            
 permanently avoided and the dirtiest  
 water remains in the reservoir.It is  
 via these two outlets that water is   
 ducted into the water treatment plant 
 situated approximately a quarter of a 
 mile further down the valley.         
  Once inside the treatment works,the  
 water is first disinfected,by the     
 injection of the liquid gas chlorine  
 under pressure.A liquid form of alum  
 is next introduced.This acts as a     
 coagulent,which brings all the dirt   
 and algae together and facilitates    
 their removal.The water then passes on
 to the huge filter beds of which there
 are sixteen.Each bed contains six tons
 of sand and five thousand gallons pass
 through each bed every hour.Here the  
 water is purified.So much dirt is     
 removed that every filter has to be   
 backwashed once every day.            </content>
