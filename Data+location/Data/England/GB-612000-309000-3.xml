		<content>  Marlingford is a small village in the
 suburbs of Norwich,{population of     
{about 300}.There is a telephone box, a
 village hall, a cricket pitch, a post 
 box, a pub, a church, and a mill      
 through which the river{Wensum}flows. 
 There used to be a post office but it 
 was closed a few years ago because it 
 was robbed many times.

 have a choice as to which school they 
 are to go to. Easton, Bawburgh and    
 Barford offer{infant and junior       
 schools, but senior pupils have a     
 choice of Costessey High or any other 
 nearby High school.
