 his coal supply from{Mr.J.B. Watson   
 who lives in{Stockton.}My dad has a   
 piece of land up{Waters Lane}where he 
 stores his coal.He started in{1979.   
                                       
 My dad sells open sacks of 50kg.A     
 tonne is 20 bags of coal.He has two   
 Bedford Wagons. One can hold 10 tonnes
 the other holds 15 tonnes .He sells   
 sunbrite ,anthracite, house coal,     
 coalite,best phurnacite,and homefire. 
 Best consists of the largest lumps of 
 coal, anthracite beans are very small.
                                       
 Although the business is based in
