		<title>05Tean High Street(M.Wyatt)</title>
		<content>On my first visit to Tean from Stoke I 
entered the High Street by crossing the
bridge over the River Tean. On my left 
I saw a row of cottages and a public   
house, the White Hart, where I had     
lunch sitting in the beer garden.      
Opposite is the Recreation Ground near 
to the River. Past the White Hart is a 
bicycle shop that sells other items as 
well. Next is a newsagents where you   
can buy sweets and stationery. Over the
road nearly all the rest of the High   
Street is taken up by Tean Mill which  
dominates the street although there is 
also a butchers,a solicitors and a     
D.I.Y. shop. Opposite the Mill the road
from Cheadle joins the High Street.On  
either side of the junction is a       
butchers and a bakers.Several shops are
opposite the Mill including a pet food 
shop and a florists.The Post Office is 
in the middle of this row.             </content>
