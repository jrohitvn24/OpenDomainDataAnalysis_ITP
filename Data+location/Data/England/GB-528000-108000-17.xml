		<content>  The cows are milked at 6.00a.m. and  
 3.00p.m. In the not to distant past   
 this would have been done by hand, but
 nowadays there is a machine which can 
 milk up to 10 cows at a time.After    
 each session it has to be thoroughly  
 rinsed through with steam.            
   The crops that are grown on the farm
 are barley, maize and wheat. The maize
 is used for animal food. The wheat is 
 sold to be made into bread and        
 biscuits. The barley is taken to      
 Shoreham Harbour to be shipped to West
 Germany where it is used in the       
 brewing of beer.
