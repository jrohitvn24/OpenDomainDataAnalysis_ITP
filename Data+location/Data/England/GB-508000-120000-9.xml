		<content> Hayes Farm (arable, 170 acres) on clay
 loam grows wheat, barley and peas. The
 barley is winter-sown, harvested mid- 
 July and shipped directly to Poland,  
 being earlier than their harvest.  The
 straw is baled and taken away.  Also, 
 15 acres of old pasture land are being
 used for supplying turves, on a once- 
 off contract.  The turf company is    
 upgrading the pastures over 3 years,  
 and when the turves have been removed 
 the farmer will replant with wheat. He
 grows pumpkins &amp; squashes organically 
 on 4 acres (using mushroom manure and 
 hand and mechanical hoeing) for his   
 health food shops. Over 5 years he has
 repaired a very deep drain under a    
 hedge/ditch so curing wet patches; the
 tile drainage under every field has   
 been replaced by plastic pipes (with  
 perforated holes) laid 4-5 ft deep    
 every 22 yards across the fields.     </content>
