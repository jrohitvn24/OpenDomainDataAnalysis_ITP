		<content> We left school at 2.30pm and we       
 arrived at the hospital at 2.45pm. As 
 soon as we got there Miss Turton, the 
 hospital secretary was waiting for us.
 She was very pleasant, big and had    
 blonde hair. She had on a blue nurse's
 dress and a white frilly hat. The     
 hospital is very large and there are a
 lot of wards and the wards are kept   
 very                                  
 clean and tidy. All the nurses in the 
 hospital were very pleasant and kind  
 to us. Also they had the same uniform 
 on if they were staff nurses. All the 
 nurses had different duties but while 
 we were there, there was an emergency.
 All the nurses and doctors were       
 rushing up and down the corridor with 
 different equipment.
