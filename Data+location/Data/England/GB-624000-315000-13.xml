		<content>   When we did our survey we found that
 most people had{televisions}and they  
 used this appliance most.All people   
 had a{telephone}and most had a{washing
{machine.                              
   We gave out twenty one leaflets and 
 found out that everybody had at least 
 three appliances.All the bigger houses
 had more appliances than the smaller  
 houses.                               
   We also found that older people     
 did not have the things the younger   
 people had ,for example{,computers,   
{stereos, microwaves}and{dishwashers.  
 The longest time somebody had had an  
 appliance (a television) was thirty   
 nine years.
