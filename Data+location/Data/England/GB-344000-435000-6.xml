		<content> There are three kinds of crops grown  
 in this area. They are wheat, barley  
 and potatoes. Out of these the most   
 common is potatoes and then barley and
 wheat. When our barley and wheat is   
 harvested it goes to Sharrocks mill   
 near Woodplumpton, Where it is made   
 into provin which are pellets for     
 cows, calves etc. The barley and wheat
 is harvested in September to October. 
 It is planted between April and May.  
  Some farms during the Winter also    
 grow barley,this provides straw during
 the Winter straw is the remainder of  
 the barley after its been thrashed of 
 barley.Potatoes are grown during the  
 Summer. They are picked and planted   
 about the same time as barley.Our     
 potatoes are sold to wholesalers who  
 buy four or five tonnes at a time.    
 Then they are sold on the market, a   
 place where things are bought or sold.</content>
