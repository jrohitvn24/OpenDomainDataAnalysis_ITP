		<title>09TRAFFIC IN EWOOD, BLACKBURN</title>
		<content>      On Tuesday 4th June 1985, we     
 carried out a traffic survey for 20   
 minutes on Bolton Road, the A666 from 
 Darwen to Blackburn.                  
      The total number of vehicles     
 heading towards Blackburn was 206, and
 heading towards Darwen was 230.       
      Of the total going towards       
 Blackburn, there were 7 buses/coaches,
 50 commercial vehicles, 145 cars and  
 4 cycles/motorcycles.                 
      Of the total heading towards     
 Darwen, 5 were buses/coaches, 60 were 
 commercial vehicles, 157 were cars and
 8 were cycles/motorcycles.            
      We thought that this was a large 
 number of vehicles, especially when we
 considered that it was not a market   
 day in either Blackburn or Darwen.    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
