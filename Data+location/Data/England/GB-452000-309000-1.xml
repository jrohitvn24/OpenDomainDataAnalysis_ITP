 This area is dominated by {Bradgate   
{Park}. The 1000 acre park is          
 approximately 6 miles from the centre 
 of Leicester. It bracken covered hills
 and Cambrian volcanic granite outcrop 
 along with the herds of grazing red   
 and fallow deer make this area an     
 extremely popular destination for     
 visitors. The house once occupied by {
{Lady Jane Grey}is now in ruins but the
 small chapel houses an interesting    
 museum.                               
 Visitors to the park usually pass     
 through the picturesque village of{   
{Newtown Linford}with its thatched     
 cottages and parish church. The other 
 village near by is{Cropston}set beside
 the scenic reservoir.

 There is a primary and secondary      
 school on the outskirts of{Anstey}.   </content>
