		<title>08Bishop's Wood Sub-station.</title>
		<content>{Bishops wood sub-station}is an        
 outstanding example of the care that  
 is taken in the siting of large       
 electrical installations to insure as 
 far as possible that they blend with  
 their surroundings.The sub-station was
 sited in the middle of the wood,in a  
 natural "bowl"in the terrian with     
 natural and man-made landscape        
 features forming an effective screen  
 around it.The trees mask the harsh    
 outline of the switchgear from view.  
 Covering an area of about 2.5 hectares
 (6 acres),the sub-station was built at
  a cost of about Â£2 million(at 1970   
  values).Underground cable prevents   
  a "wirescape"effect.The C.E.G.Bs'    
 principal statutory duty is to provide
 an efficient and economical supply of 
 electricity.Every care has been taken 
 to lessen the inevitable visual impact
 on the natural environment.(M.Dickson)</content>
