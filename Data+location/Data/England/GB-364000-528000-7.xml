		<content> Milburn is a rural area where         
 community policing is responsible for 
 law and order. The local policeman    
 lives in one of the villages in this  
 case Kirkby Thore and is responsible  
 for the surrounding villages.He       
 becomes a familiar character and      
 through friendship and interest is    
 able to keep a watchful eye on the    
 people. He becomes involved with the  
 youngsters through football, road     
 safety and youth clubs.               
 When problems arise and cannot be     
 dealt with immediately by this        
 policeman they are referred to the    
 nearest town Appleby but should       
 dentention be necessary then the      
 person will be transferred to Penrith.
