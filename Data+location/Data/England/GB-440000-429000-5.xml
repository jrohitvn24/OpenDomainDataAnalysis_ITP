 consideable amount of old stained     
 glass bearing local family names of   
 the delaceys , Castille Fitzallen     
 Warren , Leventhorpe , Clair , Savile 
 , Thornhill Goldsborough Eure and     
 Scrope families , The roof is almost  
 flat and the timbers rest on stone    
 corbels. Near the window in the South 
 East of the sanctuary there are two   
 piscina niches dating back to the 13  
 th century. The font is cup-shaped and
 is a Restoration Font built in 1663 , 
 In the Parish Register dating from    
 1539 coal mining was mentioned 1659.

 being founded in 1549 by reverand     
 George Goldsworth. The church was     
 dedicated to Saint Mary.To the south  
 of the porch is a sundial mounted on a
 badly weathered pillar.               </content>
