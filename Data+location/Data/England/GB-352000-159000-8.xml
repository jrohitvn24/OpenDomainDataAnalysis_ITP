		<title>08The Chew Valley Bed Race</title>
		<content> The Bed Race is an annual event       
 organised by Chew Valley Round Table. 
 The Race is around the Chew Valley    
 Lake and goes through the area. Men   
 and women run round the lake pushing  
 beds with steering wheels attached.   
 Sometimes, people dress up in funny   
 costumes and decorate their beds. In  
 the weeks leading up to the race, the 
 competitors get people to sponsor     
 them. It raises about Â£10,000 each    
 year and all the money goes to        
 charity.                              
   The course is about 10 miles long   
 and goes through surrounding villages 
 whilst going round the lake. Lots of  
 people turn out for the occasion and a
 tradition is squirting water and      
 throwing flour at them. Hundreds of   
 people compete and it is very         
 enjoyable.
