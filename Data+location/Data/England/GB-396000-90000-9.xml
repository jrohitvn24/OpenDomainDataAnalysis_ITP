 The house was built around{1818. }The 
 architecture is in the Italian style  
 and is unusual in that it has curved  
 colonnaded screens on either side of  
 the main house.  The house was built  
 by the{Spurvier}family, wealthy       
 merchants and bankers.  The family    
 fortune was amassed from successful   
 trading in Newfoundland Cod.  The     
 house passed through the hands of     
 several families, including the       
{Doughties}and finally the{Llewellins. 
 Mr W. Llewellin was the High Sherriff 
 of Dorset in 1919.  His son John      
 became an MP in 1929 and became       
 president of the Board of Trade.  He  
 was made Baron Llewellin of Upton in  
 1945.  Lord Llewellin was Governor    
 General of Rhodesia from 1953-1957.   
 The house and grounds were given to   
 Poole in{1957.                        </content>
