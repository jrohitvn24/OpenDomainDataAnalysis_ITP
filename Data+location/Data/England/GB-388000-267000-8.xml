		<title>08ELMBRIDGE-DAIRY&amp; SHEEP FARMS</title>
		<content> Elmbridge consists of about 27 farms  
 ranging from two to six hundred       
 acres,the average being about one     
 hundred. The soil type is             
 predominantly clay which is used      
 mainly for dairying and sheep. An     
 average dairy herd would be around one
 hundred cows. These are milked by     
 machine and the milk is sold to the   
 Milk Marketing Board. A house cow is  
 kept on one farm. Most old buildings  
 are no longer used for their original 
 purpose and many farms have new       
 buildings to house their stock. Hay   
 and silage is produced from the grass 
 and is used for winter feeding. Silage
 is stored in large purpose built sheds
 then covered with polythene to prevent
 fermenting. Flocks of sheep range from
 12 to 500 and are sold to             
 co-operatives and local markets as    
 stores or fat lambs.                  </content>
