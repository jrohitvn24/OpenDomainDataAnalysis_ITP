		<content> In our survey area there are two      
 football pitches.  These pitches are  
 in Tamerton Vale Primary School       
 grounds.  They are used during the day
 by school pupils and in the evenings  
 and weekends by young people who live 
 in the area.  On the school playground
 there are two metal objects, one in   
 the shape of an aeroplane, the other  
 shaped like a ball.  These are both   
 for climbing on.                      
 Away from the school ground there is  
 an area of grass with a stream running
 through it.  Across Tamerton Foliot   
 there is a large area of woodland     
 owned by the Woodland Trust.  This    
 also has a stream where children play.
