   The{houses}where we live are quite  
 small; they have one dining room, one 
 bathroom, three bedrooms, one kitchen,
 one living room and one attic.        
 Around our houses are more houses.    
                                       
   Our{estate}is near the beach, we    
 just have to cross the road to reach  
 it. Around our estate it is quiet.    
 All the houses have gardens which are 
 quite small.  The houses are spaced   
 out a little bit.                     
                                       
   Close by there are three big{shops} 
 and three small shops.  Our{play area}
 is a park which has one swing. We also
 play at the F.B.Fields  which is a    
 sports area.
