		<content> Most school days I get up at 7.3O,wash
 and put on my school uniform of green 
 skirt &amp; jumper,white blouse with green
 &amp; yellow striped tie.For breakfast I  
 usually have cereal &amp; toast then go to
 the bus stop.The school bus arrives at
 8.20. The old school bell rings at 9am
 and there is a daily assembly. We do  
 mathematics until 10.40 playtime.Next 
 there is an hour of English until     
 lunch.Dinners are cooked at the school
 &amp; cost 65p.                           
 In the afternoon we do things like art
 drama,games,environmental studies.    
 School finishes at 3.30.I might join  
 in out of school activities -badminton
 netball,cross country running. If not,
 I get the school bus home at 3.50.    
 When home,I change out of school      
 clothes and play on my bike with my   
 friends until tea time at about 6pm.I 
 read,do homework or watch T.V.at night</content>
