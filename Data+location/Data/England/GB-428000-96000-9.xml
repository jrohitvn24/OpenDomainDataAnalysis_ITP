		<content>  You will see many horses in this     
 area. To the North ponies roam freely 
 in the{New Forest.}All are owned by   
 somebody and are branded with their   
 owners' names. Owners pay a fee of Â£10
 per year to the Agisters for grazing  
 rights.The{ponies}are rounded up at   
 various times of the year and official
 pony sales, a tourist attraction, take
 place near Beaulieu Station. Cattle   
 grids mark the extremities of the New 
 Forest to prevent the ponies straying 
 on to private land or the busy        
 mainroads.                            
  Many of the private houses in the    
 area have{stables}attached,and it is a
 common sight to see horses munching in
 the paddocks and a horse box parked in
 the drive.Many farmers own horses or  
 rent out fields for grazing. The sight
 of a pony and trap is still seen quite
 often between Sway &amp; Lymington.       </content>
