		<content> Today Stanmore hall is a motor museum,
 started by two men:Bob Roberts and    
 Mike Barker,who needed money to run   
 their rally car.The museum has a      
 Porshe 917 which can go over 200M.P.H.
 the same car apeared in the film 'Le  
 Mans'starring Paul Newman.The oldest  
 car in the museum is a 1913 Hispano   
 Suiza and the newest car is a 1980    
 Vauxall Chevette rally car which      
 Russell Brookes drove in the Lombard  
 Rally.                                
 The most valuable car is a Napier     
 Railton.This car is the only one made 
 of its kind, and is worth over half a 
 million pounds, it was owned by John  
 Cobb. As time goes by it is very      
 likley that the museum will grow in   
 importance.
