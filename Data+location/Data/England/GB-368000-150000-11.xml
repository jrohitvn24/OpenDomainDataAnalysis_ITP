		<title>11HOME LIFE IN KILMERSDON</title>
		<content> Life style is still determined by     
 farming connections but electricity   
 and the media have done much to bring 
 the benefits of town life to the      
 country. Car ownership has broadened  
 horizons encouraging social mobility. 
 Enthusiastic gardeners abound         
 producing good fresh vegetables       
 storing the surplus in freezers. There
 is always always keen interest in W I 
 cookery demonstrations and the annual 
 produce show. Many take great pride in
 their homes, which are central to the 
 way of life in the villages. Houses   
 are well equipped and both husband and
 wife are often DIY enthusiasts. There 
 is plenty of hospitality mostly at an 
 informal level. Both families and     
 single people keep pets for           
 companianship and protection. Cats,   
 birds and dogs of all sizes are most  
 popular.                              </content>
