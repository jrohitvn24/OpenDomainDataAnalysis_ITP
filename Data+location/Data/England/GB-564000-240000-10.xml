		<title>10Bower Hall Estate, cont.</title>
		<content> When the present owners father took   
 over the farm about 35 years ago,     
 whilst clearing the lime trees which  
 lined the drive and most of the other 
 trees from the Park, remains of a     
 brick built{tunnel}were unearthed.    
 This tunnel is believed to have run   
 from the{Hall}to the{Church. }The Park
 area was sold about 20 years ago to   
 Tanner &amp; Wicks and plans were passed  
 to build the{Bower Hall Estate}of some
 150 houses.  Also incorporated is     
{Bendyshe Court}(sheltered             
 accommodation for the elderly) and the
 Infants School.  There is a largish   
 pond at the farm on which live and    
 breed ducks, geese and guinea fowl.   
 There is also a peacock and peahen.  A
 few bantams are kept for eggs and     
 pheasants are bred for sport.  There  
 are two horses, a small stable and a  
 hay barn, but no other livestock.     </content>
