		<title>08MRS. CRUST OF HALTON</title>
		<content> Mrs.Crust has lived in Halton Holegate
 for over 60 years.She was born in the 
 farmhouse where her son now lives.    
 there was a lot of work to do on the  
 farm because everything was done by   
 hand,even pumping the water.Shire-    
 Horses were bred to help with the work
 and more men were employed because    
 there were no tractors.The Church has 
 not changed except for the lights     
 which are now run by electricity.There
 used to be a bridge over the Hollow-  
 Gate from the Rectory to the Church.  
 The School had about 38 children who  
 stayed there until they were 14.There 
 were 2 shops,a Post Office,a Pub and  
 a mens reading room in Halton Holegate
 now there is only a Pub.The train also
 used to go from Halton Holegate to    
 Skegness and Spilsby but not anymore.
