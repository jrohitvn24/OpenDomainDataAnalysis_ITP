		<title>04    Roads in our Area</title>
		<content>    Situated at one corner of Britain, 
 no motorways go through our area,     
 though a main road ends here. We have 
 a network of major and minor roads    
 linking our town with Ramsgate and    
 Margate, and leading out of the Isle  
 of Thanet towards Dover, Canterbury   
 and the M2 motorway to London. Many of
 our local roads are old country lanes 
 which were never widened and are      
 consquently vey congested at times,   
 especially in summer when holiday     
 makers are in Thanet. Some newer roads
 are wider, and were built to bypass   
 the old village areas. One road, the  
 Dane Court Road, is being widened at  
 the moment. It was a very bad road,   
 without pavements, narrow and with a  
 nasty bend close by a farm. Many      
 accidents have occurred along this    
 road, which had a badly potholed      
 surface for many years.               </content>
