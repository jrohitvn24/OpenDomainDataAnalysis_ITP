		<content>{ENTRY A:}I like to go to the          
 churchyard with Stuart and climb      
 trees. Sometimes I go to Riggies Field
 and play on the swings and go on the  
 BMX track.                            
    Sometimes Stuart and his brother   
 and I go to Texas,a large supermarket.
 Sometimes we go to the haunted church.
 Last week Stuart and I were in my     
 house playing with my model           
 aeroplanes.                           
{ENTRY B:}I don't have much spare time.
 Sometimes I watch the TV or read a    
 book.I practise my 'cello every night 
 for 15-20 minutes. On Monday I go to  
 scouts,and on Tuesday I go to         
 orchestra practice.                   
     I sometimes paint pictures or     
 invent things. I have invented a      
 version of Roller Hockey. I also like 
 to go swimming,especially diving in,  
 and also ice-skating.                 </content>
