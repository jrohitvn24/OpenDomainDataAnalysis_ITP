		<title>18A SCHOOLGIRL'S DAY</title>
		<content>  I am Rachael Hudson and I live in    
 Billingborough,Lincolnshire. I have a 
 variety of pets. I get up at 8a.m. on 
 school days. We are not allowed into  
 school before 8.45a.m. so I set off at
 8.40. I usually meet my friend Rachel 
 Wesley and walk to school with her.   
 When we get there we play skipping    
 with our friends. Before morning break
 we have a choice of work.I usually    
 write stories. At break I play        
 football and then we work until lunch 
 time. After lunch I play football     
 again. In the afternoon we do a       
 variety of work including art and     
 computers. Computers are boring!      
  At 3.30p.m. we go home. At the       
 Primary School I can wear the clothes 
 I like but when I go to the High      
 School in September I shall have to   
 wear a uniform.
