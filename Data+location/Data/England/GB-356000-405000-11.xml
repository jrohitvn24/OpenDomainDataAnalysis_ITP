		<title>11WIGAN ATHLETIC FOOTBALL CLUB</title>
		<content>{ Wigan Athletic,}based at Springfield 
 Park, has become famous at last this  
 year because they reached the final of
 the{Freight-Rover Trophy}at{Wembley.  
 This is a cup competition for all     
 Third and Fourth division clubs. They 
 won{3-1}in the final against Brentford
 in a thrilling match enjoyed by both  
 sets of supporters.                   
  This was particularly pleasing for   
 the supporters as the club was in     
 danger of relegation to Division Four 
 before the new manager{Bryan Hamilton 
 took over. They also won the{Isle of  
{Man Lancashire Cup}beating Blackburn  
 Rovers 4-0 in the final.
