 Pheasants which have wandered  away   
 from the estate.The food is still put 
 out in the woods for the pheasants and
 they eat about a ton a day.Although   
 the "season" begins on October 1st,   
 many shoots do not take place until   
 the end of the month.Throughout       
 November to February John Lewis has   
 most of his time taken up by shoots.  
 They need a lot of planning-by nine   
 am. all the pheasants must be fed,the 
 beaters and retrievers must be ready  
 and transport must be organised for   
 guests.When all this is done the shoot
 starts.If Mr. Greenwood is away John  
 Lewis takes over as host.Apart from   
 breeding 15,000 pheasants, 2,000 duck 
 and some partridge the keepers also   
 help to look after the estate.To help 
 John Lewis there are four underkeepers</content>
