		<title>08Agriculture in the Claydons</title>
		<content> The pattern of agriculture has changed
 over the years in the area around     
 Steeple Claydon.Once it was a{labour  
{-intensive}industry but modern methods
 have changed it all.In 1881 Claydon   
 Estate employed 30 men,today just 2!  
 Once the area grew{food for           
{London,}the farms were mixed but now  
 changes have been brought about by    
 economics and the Common Market.      
 Dairying is on the decline and the    
 area has largely gone over to{arable  
{farming and sheep.                    
{Wheat and barley}are the main cereals 
 grown while the yellow flowers of{oil 
{seed rape}dominate large swathes of   
 the landscape.                        
{Hay and silage}are grown for animal   
 feed and the harvesting of these is an
 example of where{mechanisation}has    
 replaced many workers.
