		<content> Religion in Denby has declined in     
 recent years. The{only church}now in  
 use is{St Johns}which became part of  
 the Wakefield Diocese in 1888.        
 However, there has been a church on   
 this sight since 850 AD when the      
 village was called Denebi and was     
 settled by the Danes. The{congregation
 at the church is now{small}and the    
 church shares a vicar with 2          
 neighbouring villages of Denby        
 Dale and Cumberworth. The vicarage    
 is now a private property. Many people
 in the village are{Quakers}and attend 
 the{Meeting House at High Flatts.     
 Many people also attend the{Methodist 
{Church}in Denby Dale.
