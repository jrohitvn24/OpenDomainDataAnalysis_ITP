		<title>15EMPLOYMENT:A HULL SURVEY</title>
		<content>      In a survey of children in our   
 school, we discovered that many more  
 had fathers who were in full-time     
 employment than mothers.   50% of the 
 children had a father in full-time    
 employment - only 12% had a mother so 
 employed.   6% had both parents in    
 full- time work.                      
      Most part-time workers were      
 mothers - 40% of all children asked   
 had a Mum who worked part-time        
 compared to 6% of Dads.   21% had a   
 Dad who worked full-time and a Mum who
 worked part-time.                     
      10% of Dads were unemployed      
 compared to 6% of Mums.   Another 10% 
 said that their Dad did not work,     
 whereas 34% said that Mum did not     
 work.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
