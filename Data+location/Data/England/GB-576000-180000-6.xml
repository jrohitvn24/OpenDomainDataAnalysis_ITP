		<title>06CANVEY'S SEA WALL</title>
		<content>{                                      
  Canvey is an island which is         
 surrounded by the river Thames. The   
 river is tidal,which means that the   
 tide rises and falls every 12 hours.  
 Every 25 years or so there is a freak 
 high tide, and there has been a danger
 that London will be flooded. However, 
 now that the London Barrier is        
 working, then Canvey had to be        
 protected too. This meant that the    
 local sea walls had to be rebuilt. The
 old walls were not thick or high      
 enough. The new sea defences are much 
 higher and stronger. The walls are    
 thicker at the bottom than at the top.
 They are made of gigantic concrete    
 blocks,which fit together like a      
 jigsaw. The joints are sealed with    
 tar.The top of the wall is curved     
 towards the sea,so that high waves    
 will be rolled back into the sea.     </content>
