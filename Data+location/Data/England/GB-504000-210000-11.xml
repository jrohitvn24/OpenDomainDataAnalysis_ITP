		<title>11Woodhall Farm Housing Estate</title>
		<content> Woodhall Farm is a large estate on the
 North-East edge of Hemel Hempstead.   
 The{developers, Fairview,}started     
 building about 10 years ago and have  
 just finished the last phase.         
 There is a mixture of detached,       
 semi-detached and terraced houses and 
 some blocks of flats. 3 or 4 bedroomed
 houses are the most common. The flats 
 currently sell for about{Â£34,000}and  
 the houses from{Â£43,000.}             
 All the houses have a kitchen and a   
 lounge-diner downstairs and most      
 have 2 toilets. Many houses have been 
 extended and modified.                
 Very few areas had a{gas supply}laid  
 on so they rely on{electricity}for    
{heating}as well as lighting. Some     
 owners however have converted their   
 heating to{oil or solid fuel,}and a   
 new gas main is being laid round the  
 estate for those who want gas.        </content>
