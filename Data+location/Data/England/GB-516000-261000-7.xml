		<content>  There are three benches on the Main  
 Street.These are used by people to sit
 and watch the beautiful flowers in the
 gardens and the nice old houses.The   
 seats have not been vandelised, this  
 shows that people respect their       
 village.                              
  When there is a funeral the hearse   
 and mourners cannot go across the ford
 to the cemetry they have to travel on 
 the busy A45 and then the A1.This     
 cemetry is the one used by our village
 and it is quite new because some of   
 our school went to the dedication     
 service.                              
  Some people think that the Hail part 
 of the Anglo Saxon name means healthy,
 because compared to villagers in the  
 valleys they seem to be.
