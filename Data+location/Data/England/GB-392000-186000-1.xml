		<title>01General Survey of Malmesbury</title>
		<content>    {Malmesbury}is a small town in the 
 North West corner of Wiltshire,       
 situated on a hill with the River Avon
 flowing around it on its way to the   
 Bristol Channel. It is the oldest     
 Borough in England, King Alfred having
 granted it a charter in 880 AD. The   
 town is most famous for its Abbey.    
 Only a small part of the once         
 magnificent Abbey Church now remains. 
{King Athelstan}is said to have been   
 buried there in 939 AD.               
     The town has a thriving shopping  
 centre and a number of new, small     
 industries have moved there in recent 
 years. The present population is{2500,
 but is growing steadily. It is unusual
 that for such a small town it has its 
 own{hospital and part time fire       
{service.}We think it is a pleasant,   
 friendly place in which to live.
