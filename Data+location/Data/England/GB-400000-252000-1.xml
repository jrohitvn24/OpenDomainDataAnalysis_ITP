		<content> The land is mainly used for growing   
 crops, e.g. wheat, fodder or for      
 pasture with little dereliction.  Very
 few orchards remain.  The area is     
 untypically hilly for this part of    
 England, with mixed woodland covering 
 no more than one fifth, usually the   
 highest ground, around 110 metres.    
 Transport is solely by road.  There is
 but one shop, a farm shop and no post 
 office or schools.  Property,         
 including the 5 or so farms are well  
 maintained.  About 30% is either half 
 timbered or large, i.e. 18th/19th     
 century vicarage, grange etc.         
 Paraffin is supplied in bulk at the   
 one garage and there is a local coach 
 operator.  There was little outside   
 agricultural work to be seen on this  
 November day.A high proportion of the 
 population travel to adjacent towns   
 for their work or education.          </content>
