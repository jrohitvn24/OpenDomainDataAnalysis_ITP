		<content> Saxilby Post  Office  is  situated  at
 39/41   High  Street  and  provides  a
 counter service for the village and is
 the  main  delivery  centre  for   the
 surrounding  area.  There is a sorting
 office  at  the  Post   Office   which
 accomodates nine postal delivery staff
 who  are  employed by the Post Office,
 two  full-time  and  seven  part-time.
 Three mail vans and one moped are used
 for  the rural deliveries, plus cycles
 for the village rounds,  and  all  are
 garaged  on  the premises. The counter
 service is the sole responsibility  of
 the  Sub-Postmaster,  who employs four
 part-time  assistants  to  serve  both
 Post  Office  and  shop customers. The
 main services are  the  encashment  of
 pensions  and  allowances and the work
 of the National Girobank, which is the
 main  growth  business  for  the  Post
 Office at the present time.           </content>
