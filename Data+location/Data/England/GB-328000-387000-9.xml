		<content>    A significant change that has taken
 place in this area during the last ten
 years  was  the  demise of many of the
 local shops. This was accounted for by
 the  expansion  and  rebuilding of the
 town  Shopping  Centre  which provides
 multiple chain  store outlets , super-
 markets  and  hypermarkets.There  were
 mixed feelings about this development:
   "Centralising  the  market and shops
 is helpful ,a wide range  of goods are
 in a compact area ."                  
   "I feel it has taken a lot away from
 the town centre ,old buildings gave it
 an individual character.Now it is just
 like  hundreds of others up  and  down
 the country."                         
   "Shoppers are more willing to travel
 now  that  they  have  more public and
 private transport and this  has killed
 off the "corner-shop."
