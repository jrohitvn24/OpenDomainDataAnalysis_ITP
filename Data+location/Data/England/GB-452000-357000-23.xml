Since the previous project one of the greatest innovations into everyday life is the mobile telephone and Wikipeadia reports that during the period 1990 - 2010 the use of mobiles has increased from 12.4 million to around 4.6 billion.&lt;br />&lt;br />Almost all the people spoken to had their own mobile telephone and used it on a daily basis.  Children as well as adults own their own and they also use email, facebook and twitter to communicate with friends.  Letter writing has almost become extinct and the only time post office mail is used to communicate with friends is to send birthday, Christmas and anniversary cards.  Mail is still used for invitations and thank you notes but mainly computers and telephone are the first modes of communication.&lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
