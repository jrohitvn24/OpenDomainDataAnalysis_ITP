		<title>08N. Bransholme, history.</title>
		<content> Bransholme was started in the late    
{1960's}as part of the Government      
 re-housing program. Families where    
 moved from the older areas around the 
 fish docks in West and the dockland of
 East Hull.                            
                                       
 Many of the older parts of Hull had   
 been damaged during the heavy bombing 
 raids of the{1939-45 war}and were     
 considered top be irreparable. The    
 original estate was built to cater for
{35,000}people, but cut-backs in the   
 80's lead to part of the Northern     
 Estate being left unbuilt.            
                                       
 Lack of funds and poor planning also  
 lead to delays of many ammenities for 
 the Northern section of the estate of 
 some{5,000}people.
