		<title>16Transport in Curdridge.</title>
		<content>     Botley Railway Station is situated
 in Curdridge.  The line is a loop line
 between Eastleigh and Fareham, but    
 connections can be made easily to     
 anywhere in the country.              
     Only two bus services run through 
 Curdridge - 75 between Southampton and
 Fareham, and 75A between Southampton  
 and Bishops Waltham.  The 75 passes   
 through Curdridge 6 times a day, and  
 the 75A 4 times a day.                
     Parents at Curdridge Primary      
 School were asked how often they used 
 public transport.  They responded:
