		<content> The first thing for example is you    
 have to get used to different food    
 because{you cannot get everything you 
{had in your own country.}Even all the 
 daily habits may seem strange at      
 first: How people greet each other,   
 How they talk to each other, when they
 have their main meal of the day, the  
 time they go to work, etc. There is   
 also a different way of thinking and  
 feeling{although in the end it may    
{come to the same result.              
                                       
  As there are so many things that are 
 different from their equivalent in    
 Germany for example, in the everyday  
 life,{the most difficult task is to   
{accept them as they are and not to    
{compare which way is better.          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
