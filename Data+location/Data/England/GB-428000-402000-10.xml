		<title>10FARM STUDY 1</title>
		<content> The farm has 300sheep,32 cows,12000   
 turkeys.They feed the turkeys on their
 own mix of cereal,fishbone,grassmeal, 
 meat and bone meal,soya meal and      
 limestone.The latter makes the        
 eggshells harder.They do not breed    
 their own turkeys but buy them in as  
 day old poults from the hatchery.These
 are put in large sheds with the       
 temperature maintained at 30 degrees  
 Centigrade and as they get older the  
 temp. is reduced gradually.           
 When the turkeys are fully grown they 
 are moved to the fattening sheds,they 
 are slaughtered after 20-30           
 weeks.After slaughtering they are deep
 frozen(down to -30 degrees Cent.).It  
 takes a day for this to happen but for
 large turkeys it may take two         
 days.They also rear chickens for      
 fattening and they kill approx.800    
 chickens a day.                       </content>
