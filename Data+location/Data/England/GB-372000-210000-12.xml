		<content> Gloucestershire has a reputation      
 for{Elver}fishing.These{baby Eels}have
 crossed the Atlantic from their       
 birthplace in the Sargasso Sea and    
 Ascend the{River Severn}in enormous   
 numbers in early Spring.Most Elvers   
 are caught in simple nets held at the 
 water's edge.                         
 During the season it is a common sight
 to see men leaving Gloucester and     
 heading for the River with their      
 nets.The Elvers that escape the nets  
 work their way up-river and then into 
 tributary streams to isolated ponds   
 where they grow to mature Eels.       
 Many Elvers are now exported to       
 countries like Japan where they are a 
 great delicacy.                       
 One of the {Collecting Stations}for   
 Elvers is in this block.
