		<title>19RUDDINGTON PEOPLE--MILKMAN</title>
		<content>{MICHAEL JACK}is one of the popular    
 people in{Ruddington.}He is the       
 village milkman but he is also on many
 committees such as the{James Peacock  
{Trust.}He has lived in {Ruddington }  
 all his life and has seen many        
 changes.                              
 There have been a lot of houses built 
 which has meant more shops.When it was
 smaller there used to be a village    
{Sports Day}and the{Wakes}used to be   
 held on the green. Every-body used to 
 join in but now it is just a fair and 
 the only custom kept is the service on
 Sunday.                               
 The only change in milk delivering is 
 a motorised float and a lot of people 
 order skimmed milk because they are   
 slimming or think it is better for    
 their health.
