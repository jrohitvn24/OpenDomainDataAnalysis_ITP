		<title>16Industry_Quarrying</title>
		<content> There is a small limestone quarry near
 Great Ponton, which employs 2 people. 
 The stone mainly goes to local        
 areas,not just for building but for   
 landscape gardening as weel.Mr.       
 Beauchamp showed us a fossil,found in 
 a nearby quarry which was dated back  
 to 250 million years ago.Lorries from 
 the quarry do not go through Great    
 Ponton but turn left onto the B6403   
 (Ermine Street).The road is very dusty
 and does get muddy during the         
 Winter.The surface is getting a little
 rough due to the heavy pounding of the
 lorries.                              
   There is no other industry in Great 
 Ponton apart from a disused warehouse 
 which now stores pallets.The parish   
 council hopes to remove this eyesore  
 shortly.
