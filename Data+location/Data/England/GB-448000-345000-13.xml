  The{Greasley Board School}was opened 
 in 1878 and originally was housed in  
 3 departments.The girls used the      
 Dovecote Rd. wing,the boys the Mill   
 Rd. wing and the infants the part     
 situated diagonally between.The       
 Register shows that{D.H.Lawrence}was a
 pupil at the school for periods from {
{1889}to{1898.}Since 1976 the Dovecote 
 Road School has been used exclusively 
 for infants and the new school        
 building, which was opened in phases  
 from{1965,}has been used for the      
 juniors.Since then the junior school  
 has seen many changes and a new       
 extension was added in 1980.The junior
 school at present has 283 children on 
 roll with a headmaster and ten        
 teachers.The two schools are known as 
 the{Greasley Beauvale Inf. School}and 
 the{Greasley Beauvale Junior School.  </content>
