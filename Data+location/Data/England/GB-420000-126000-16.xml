 different schools during the Autumn   
 and Spring terms. Here is a list of   
 all the schools we play against       
 Alderbury, Redlynch, Nomansland,      
 Farley, Odstock, Landford. We have    
 football practice on Saturday mornings
 and Thursday afternoons during the    
 football season. We run the mini      
 marathon every summer. We run against 
 local schools and also schools from   
 Salisbury and Warminster. We play     
 rounders and cricket during the       
 summer. We do athletics for our own   
 School Sports and the Small School

 competition at school. You get points 
 for each event and there are gold,    
 silver and bronze awards.
