		<title>07Transport in Parbold</title>
		<content>{Car Ownership:} The use of a car was  
 felt to be necessary for shopping     
 trips to Southport, Wigan and Preston,
 as well as for visiting the nearest   
 hospital in Ormskirk. Therefore car   
 ownership in Parbold is quite high    
 with most households having one car.  
 It was stated by the people we        
 interviewed that public transport     
 services were not very good.          
{Bus:}In a recent survey in Parbold, it
 was found that 32 people use public   
 transport for work more or less       
 regularly with the main destinations  
 being Wigan, Southport, Ormskirk and  
 Liverpool. Since there is no secondary
 school in Parbold, children use the   
 bus regularly to school.              
{Train:}There has been a railway       
 station in Parbold since the 1840s and
 is extensively used by commuters to   
 Southport and Manchester.             </content>
