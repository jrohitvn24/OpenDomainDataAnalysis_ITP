		<title>17CROSS COUNTRY RUNNING</title>
		<content> The start of a run used by Stoneygate 
 School pupils is in a middle-class    
 area on the school side of the        
 Leicestershire Golf Course. The run   
 takes us through the Course and out   
 onto Shady Lane, onto Gartree Road,   
 then running all the way up to the    
 roundabout. We pass undulating land   
 which used to be a medieval farm, and 
 Piggie's Hollow, the remains of a     
 Norman settlement.                    
 Our schoolboy humour says that        
 throughout the run we must be alert   
 for whizzing golf balls, or we may be 
 confronted by the Golf Course Flasher 
 who lurks behind the trees waiting to 
 jump at you. We also need to know that
 the strange hand prodding us in the   
 back is only the running teacher. Two 
 of our teachers run in the Leicester  
 Marathon which uses part of the London
 Road in our block.                    </content>
