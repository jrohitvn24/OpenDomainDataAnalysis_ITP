		<title>11 Nanny's Rock</title>
		<content>Nanny's Rock is quite hard to find in  
the bushes &amp; undergrowth of Kinver     
Edge.It consists of sandstone.There are
five sandstone rooms with windows.The  
rock got its name from a woman who li- 
ved there.The chimney called'Devils    
chimney'goes up the side of the rock.  
There are lots of tales about Nanny's  
Rock including'Bladys of the Stewpony  
'.Also many highwaymen have used the   
cave for a hiding place.Our only       
information about Nanny is that of     
actress Nancy Price who would visit    
Nanny in the cave while she was making 
herbs &amp; potions.She was the only person
brave enough to visit Nanny.Then finaly
Nanny disappeared &amp; was never seen     
again.The story of Nanny might not be  
true but there is an entery of Margaret
-of-the fox earth in the parish        
register.
