		<content>    This block includes two villages,  
 Colney Heath and Welham Green,        
 together with some open country.   The
 area on the North of the block is     
 Green Belt under threat from both     
 urban and industrial development.     
 Welham Green is already the country's 
 largest industrial village and plans  
 to extend it have gained momentum with
 British Rail's decision to open a new 
 station at the village.               
    Hatfield School, already sitting   
 uneasily on the green belt is         
 threatened both by the falling        
 population of Hatfield New Town to the
 North, its main catchment area, and by
 the pressure on its land due to       
 possible development.
