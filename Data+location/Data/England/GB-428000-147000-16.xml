		<content> There is a tiered system of{government
 which runs the country and maintains  
 services right down to local level.   
{Roads}are maintained by departments   
 according to their importance.  The   
 main{Weyhill}road is being extensively
 improved by funds from{Central        
{Government}whilst local roads and     
 lanes are maintained by{Local         
{Authorities.  District Councils       
 provide the main street lighting      
 whilst the smaller{Parish Councils    
 comprise local inhabitants with       
 representation on the larger bodies.  
                                       
 The{Community Hall}is eligible for    
 Grants from Central and Local         
 Government. {Bus services, gas}and    
{electricity}supplies, and the mains   
{water,}are all maintained by Public   
 Utilities although there are moves to 
 put some back into private ownership. </content>
