		<content>  SOMERSHAM HAS A VERY GOOD, VARIED    
 SUPPLY OF SHOPS FOR A VILLAGE OF ITS  
 SIZE. THE SHOPS COVER A FAIR RANGE OF 
 LOCAL NEEDS, WITH MORE SPECIALIST     
 UNITS SUCH AS A CHEMIST, POST OFFICE, 
 TWO BANKS, AN INSURANCE BROKER AND    
 PHOTOGRAPHER PROVIDING SERICES FOR A  
 WIDER AREA. COLNE HAS ONE VILLAGE SHOP
 ON THE SOUTH EDGE OF THE SURVEY AREA. 
  THREE PUBS CLUSTER AROUND THE CROSS  
 AREA OF SOMERSHAM.                    
  ALTHOUGH MANY RESIDENTS WORK IN      
 NEARBY TOWNS, AND WITH AGRICULTURAL   
 WORK OFFERING FEWER OPPORTUNITIES,    
 THERE ARE HOWEVER A NUMBER OF JOBS IN 
 LOCAL MANUFACTURING AND COMMERCIAL    
 CONCERNS. THESE INCLUDE FRUIT PACKING 
 AND WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTION, LIGHT     
 ENGINEERING, ROAD HAULAGE, A COACH    
 COMPANY, A SPECIALIST INSULATION FIRM,
 A DOUBLE GLAZING FIRM, GARAGE SERVICES
 AND BUILDING CONTRACTORS.             </content>
