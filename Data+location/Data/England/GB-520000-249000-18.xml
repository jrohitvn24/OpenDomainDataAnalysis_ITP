		<content>{Potton Playhouse}started eight years  
 ago. They meet in the hall of the     
{United Reform Church}when they want   
 to present a play. The first pantomime
 performed was called{Aladdin}and the  
 second was{The Wild West Show}when the
 audience had to sit at tables and eat 
 sausages and mashed potato, as though 
 they were in a saloon bar. Every year 
 they have a pantomime, just after     
 Christmas, for the whole family to go 
 and watch, and in summer they present 
 plays for adults and a childrens'     
 Summer Show. Sometimes one of the     
 members writes the script and everyone
 is busy with the scenery, lights,     
 costume, make-up and learning lines   
 for plays. Some of the pantomimes they
 have done are{Cinderella, Aladdin, The
{Wizard of Oz, Snow White}and{Sleeping 
{Beauty.
