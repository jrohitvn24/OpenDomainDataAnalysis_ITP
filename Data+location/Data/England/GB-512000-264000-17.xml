		<title>17       RECREATION</title>
		<content>    Although people acquire more and   
 more home entertainments, villagers   
 make good use of the recreational     
 facilities out of doors. Children     
 enjoy riding their B.M.X. cycles,     
 skipping, roller skating and playing  
 football and cricket on the Estate    
 Play Area, whilst many adults find    
 pleasure attending to their gardens   
 (judging by the Horticultural Soc's   
 Annual Show).                         
    From our survey we found that,     
 outside the community activities and  
 Public Houses, recreational pursuits  
 included:_ snooker, volleyball, bad-  
 minton, fishing, windsurfing  and     
 sailing at Grafham Water, swimming    
 (H'don and Bedford), ice skating      
 (P'boro) and theatre visits to        
 Cambridge and Peterborogh.            
    Day trips to the East Coast and    
 Wicksteed Park are popular favourites.</content>
