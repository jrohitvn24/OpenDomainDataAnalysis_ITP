          River Avon                   
                                       
 The River Avon runs through part of   
 our survey area.The river is very     
 pretty here,with fields on either     
 side.Many pleasure boats use the river
 _ particulaly narrow boats _ and many 
 people moor by King George's Field    
 next to the market.Sailing boats and  
 canoes also use the river.Wyre Lock is
 on our stretch of the river and next  
 to that is Wyre Mill Club which was an
 old grist mill that has been          
 converted.The River often floods into 
 the surrounding fields, and in winter 
 it sometimes freezes.One year it froze
 so hard that a Land Rover drove along 
 it. Many people fish in the river.It  
 provides coarse fishing for bream,    
 roads,perch and eels.                 </content>
