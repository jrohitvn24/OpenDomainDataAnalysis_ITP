		<title>09Braintree Parking Facilities</title>
		<content>    Braintree has at present a parking 
 problem. Two main carparks are        
 available, Blyths Meadow and Sandpit  
 Lane, but are often full of motor     
 vehicles and the problem is exagerated
 during busy shopping times. On Market 
 days, Wednesdays and Saturdays, the   
 problem becomes even more accute, due 
 to both the increase in traffic and   
 the stalls standing on the small      
 parking bays scattered thoughout the  
 town.                                 
    During a survey carried out in the 
 centre of Braintree pedestrians and   
 shoppers alike expressed a wish       
 for a multi-story carpark.            
    Motorists often  use the store     
 carparks or those private ones with   
 restricted access.                    
    Three stores in the town have their
 own carparks. These are designed for  
 the use of the store patrons only.    </content>
