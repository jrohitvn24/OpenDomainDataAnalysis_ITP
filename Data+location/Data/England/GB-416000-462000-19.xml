		<content> SHOPS: There are village shops in     
 Glasshouses, Low Laithe and Dacre.    
 They sell a variety of groceries, and 
 the store in Dacre which has been     
 there for about 40 years also sells   
 wines, spirits, cigarettes and Sunday 
 newspapers. There is also a Post      
 Office in Glasshouses which sells     
 sweets and a few groceries.           
 A local farmer from Wilsill delivers  
 milk 6 days a week in Wilsill and     
 Glasshouses and many other mobile     
 shops visit the villages and sell     
 fish, meat, vegetables and ice-creams.
 A mobile library comes once a week,   
 and there are daily deliveries of the 
 post and papers (by the postman) and  
 once-weekly deliveries of the Sunday  
 newspapers.                           
 For all other shopping the people of  
 the area will either travel into Ripon
 or Harrogate and even further afield. </content>
