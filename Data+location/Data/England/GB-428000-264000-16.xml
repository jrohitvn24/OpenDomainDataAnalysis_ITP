		<content> AP football club has three teams the  
 under 10's,13's &amp; 14's this is because
 the under 12's dropped out of the     
 league &amp; the under 11's changed their 
  name to Whitnash Hardware.They are   
 all good teams.AP stands for          
 Automotive Products and AP junior     
 football club plays in AP's grounds   
 which is next to the factory.AP also  
 have a semi profesional team which is 
 in the Southern League. Whitnash      
 Hardware, formerly AP Under 11's won  
 the league last year.If you win the   
 league you get a cup and all the      
 players in the winning team and the   
 runners up get a medal each. This     
 is taken home to be kept. Trophys are 
 only kept for one year before being   
 returned and then tried to win &amp; take 
 home again.Sometimes they take you to 
 Wembley to see the England youth team 
 for about Â£6,00.                      </content>
