		<content>                                       
 Each year, thousands of people flock  
 to Blackpool to see the illuminations 
 along the promenade.This spectacle    
 lasts for two months, (September and  
 October)and is a great boost to the   
 tourist industry. On the North Shore  
 area is a long stretch of special     
 tableaux in lights. This year, the    
 most impressive was Postman Pat, a    
 popular cartoon character; there were 
 also pictures of nursery rhymes,4     
 metres high, showing Humpty Dumpty,   
 Mary, Mary Quite Contrary and others, 
 all in a multitude of flashing        
 colours. Another popular tableau is   
 Doctor Who and the Daleks; there are  
 Star Wars and robots, too. As well as 
 the stationary tableaux, there are    
 several decorated trams, which are    
 shaped like rockets, trains and boats 
 and have coloured lights all over them</content>
