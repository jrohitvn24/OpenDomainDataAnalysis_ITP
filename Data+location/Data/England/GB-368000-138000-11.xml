		<content>   These are the views expressed by    
 Mrs. Sage during an interview with    
 her.                                  
                                       
   It was a great pity when the        
{village school}closed as this meant   
 loss of contact with the{children.    
 They should have kept the school for  
 5_8 year olds as it is wrong to take  
 very young children out of the village
 for a whole day.The two{teachers}used 
 to live in the village and this was   
 good. A{Christmas party}is now held   
 for the village{children}each year.   
                                       
   Life is much easier now. In the past
 I had to gather sticks and logs for   
 fires and lamps needed trimming. I was
 very pleased when{electricity}became  
 available and the coming of the{T.V.  
 made me feel much less isolated.
