		<title>07BIOGRAPHY OF DACRE RESIDENT.</title>
		<content> Mr.Robert William Bell was born in    
 1899 and will be 86 on 20th.July      
 1985.We talked with him on the village
 green seat outside his home.He told us
 that Dacre has changed very little in 
 the 55 yrs.he has lived there.The main
 changes were the closing of the       
 village school and a small number of  
 brick built houses added to the       
 village in recent years.Dacre is very 
 much as it was in the past,unaffected 
 by change;quiet and peaceful in the   
 valley of the River Dacre from which  
 its name derives.He left school in    
 1913 age 14yrs.and started work the   
 next day.He was paid two gold         
 sovereigns for four months work.He was
 able to buy a suit of clothes,a pair  
 of clogs and a melodion ( musical     
 instrument)and had one shilling       
 change.                               
                                       </content>
