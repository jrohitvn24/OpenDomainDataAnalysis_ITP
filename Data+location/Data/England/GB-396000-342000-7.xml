		<content>   In 1934 on this site opened the     
Dilhorne Pavilion &amp; Pleasure Grounds,  
which became the Miners Welfare        
Institute, this ran until 1967.        
   The present use as a Community and  
Recreation Centre was threatened with  
closurer in 1979 when the entrance     
Lodge required structual support etc., 
at a cost of 3000 pounds approx.. This 
was raised by the committee of Trustees
in a variety of ways.                  
   Since then the committee have       
improved and modernised the Centre to  
include a new tiolet block with        
disabled facilities, re-making of the  
tenis court,improvement of the bowling 
green which stands on the foundations  
of the old Hall. Improvements have     
also been made to the children's       
playground and the recreation ground   
where the village carnival takes place 
each year.                             </content>
