 8.1 went anywhere,1 visited the local 
   pub,1 visited the local Workingman's
   Club.                               
 9.6 were Housewives,2 worked in a     
   laundry,1 worked in a pub,1 worked  
   as a school dinner lady,1 was       
   unemployed(a redundant steelworker).
                                       
 Our conclusions were people enjoy     
 where they live,rely on the buses,stay
 in at night and most of the women were
 unemployed.
