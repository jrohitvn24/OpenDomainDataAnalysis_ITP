		<title>14CHANGES IN STURTON</title>
		<content>                                       
 We went to Mr. Barlow's on Tuesday to 
 ask him how the village had changed.He
 said that the prices were very cheap  
 in fact you couldget bread for half a 
 penny.There used to be lots of shops  
 in Sturton now there are only about   
 two.We found out that the highest     
 building in Sturton was the church    
 but now it's the Power Station.There  
 used to be a Cobbler,a Black smith    
 and a Carpenter.There were no street  
 lights or house lights.There were only
 oil lamps.The transport was bicycles  
 pony and traps.Buses came in to the   
 village every hour.There was a        
 station.The trains carried passengers 
 and goods.There was one methodist     
 chapel and a sunday school building in
 Sturton.
