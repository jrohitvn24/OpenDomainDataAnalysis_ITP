		<title>18Buses - Mountain Goat</title>
		<content> The Mountain Goat bus company has been
 the pioneer of a new approach to the  
 problems of providing a commercial    
 transport service in an upland area   
 which is attractive to tourists but   
 where the road network does not allow 
 the operation of large buses and rigid
 timetables except on the main roads.  
 The company was established in the    
 early 70's, initially to provide a    
 mini-bus service in areas which the   
 big Ribble bus company would not cover
 such as Windermere - Patterdale and   
 the rural area west of the lake.      
 Now, with a fleet of mini-buses and a 
 couple of coaches, the company has    
 expanded to provide scheduled servies 
 to Glenridding over Kirkstone Pass and
 to York, and regular tours all over   
 the Lake District from both Windermere
 and Keswick. It also takes children to
 school and does a group taxi service. </content>
