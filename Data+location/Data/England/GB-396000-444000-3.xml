		<title>03A FAMILY GROCER'S</title>
		<content> Hodgsons Grocer's is situated at the  
 top end of Cononley and is a family   
 business.                             
 We interviewed the proprietor to find 
 out about local trade. The shop       
 receives just local trade which has   
 been increased with the building of   
 new flats and maisonettes opposite the
 shop. The shop trades between 8.30am  
 and 6.00pm on Mondays, Tuesdays,      
 Wednesdays and Fridays and between    
 8.30 and 12.00 noon on Thursdays and  
 Saturdays and is closed on Sundays.   
 Having only its bread and dairy       
 produce delivered the proprietors have
 to visit a cash and carry once a week 
 for all other goods.The shop makes up 
 and delivers orders which is a fast   
 declining asset.The present owners    
 have been there for 32 years and have 
 been constantly in competition with   
 the Co_op.                            </content>
