 from the ground.The doorway is very   
 narrow and is about five feet high.The
 cage was used for locking up drunks   
 and criminals before sending them for 
 trial in Sharnbrook. It would be the  
 Vicar and churchwardens who locked    
 them up because there was no police   
 force.

 war memorial built in l9l9, made of
