 in and around the village was provided
 by the surrounding farms which form   
 part of the Denbigh Estate.Many of the
 older houses in the village were built
 to house the people who worked on the 
 Estate and the farms.                 
  Today this situation has changed     
 somewhat.Quite a number of the        
 inhabitants of Monks Kirby now find

 London.Some work is provided by local 
 pubs and restaurants in Brinklow and
