		<content>  One of the largest factories in the  
 block is John Steventon &amp; Sons Ltd.,  
 owned by Ideal Standard, an American  
 company. The Royal Venten  Works      
 occupies a 14 acre site alongside the 
 Trent and Mersey Canal but the company
 uses road transport exclusively. The  
 works manufacture bathroom furniture, 
 such as hand basins, pedestals,       
 toilets, urinals, cisterns and bidets 
 in a variety of designs and colours.  
 The baths are made at Hull. The main  
 raw materials are sand from Chelford, 
 after grinding at Stoke, ball clay    
 from Devon, China clay from Cornwall  
 and Nepheline imported through Runcorn
 from Norway. Breakages are recycled in
 the industrial process. There are 400 
 employees, all but 30 office workers  
 manufacturing, packaging or in the    
 warehouse. As the work is strenuous   
 most employees are men.               </content>
