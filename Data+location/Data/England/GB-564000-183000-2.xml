		<content> A Day in the Life of James            
 On Sunday I got up at 8.42 a.m. and   
 went downstairs.  I read the mail on  
 Sunday, which includes a magazine and 
 comic.  I had breakfast which         
 consisted of a bowl of cornflakes.    
 About 9.30 a.m. I played in the garden
 with my hacky sack.  This is a small  
 leather ball, with plastic pellets    
 inside to stop it bouncing.  I went   
 straberry picking with my mum at 11.30
 a.m.for an hour near the Dog and      
 Partridge at Orsett.  We had dinner at
 1.00 p.m.  We had pork, roast         
 potatoes, yorkshire puddings, peas and
 greens.  In the afternoon I watched   
 the British Grandprix from Silverstone
 on the television.  I played with my  
 brother after that.  At 7.08 p.m. I   
 had some cheese and crackers.  In the 
 evening I watched television with my  
 dad.  I went to bed at 10.15 p.m.     </content>
