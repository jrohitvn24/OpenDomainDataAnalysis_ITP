		<content> There are many farms around Habberley,
 Stiperstones and Snailbeach and they  
 are all small farms. Usually on hill- 
 farms they only have sheep.They don't 
 have cows because on hills it is not  
 the right pasture for them. The hill  
 farms are mostly rough grazing and    
 sheep are the best kind of animals for
 rough grazing. The highest useful     
 point for farming is two thousand feet
 above sea-level.To keep cattle or     
 sheep in they use all kinds of fencing
 including wire because it's quick to  
 erect, stone walls because they last  
 and hedges because they grow naturally
 thick and strong.                     
 The most popular sheep breeds with the
 local farmers are Leicesters, Suffolks
 and mules, which are a black-face and 
 speckle-face Leicester cross.         
 The most popular cattle are Friesians 
 and Hereford cross.                   </content>
