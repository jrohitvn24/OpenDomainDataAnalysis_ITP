		<title>05A GARDEN IN CARDINGTON</title>
		<content>                                       
   When the Old Vicarage was sold by   
 the Church Authorities in 1970,the new
 owner took over a solid stone house   
 with 2+ acres of derelict garden.     
 2 years clearing was needed to start  
 the evolution of a new garden,designed
 specifically for one- man maintenance.
 This has meant concentrating on trees,
 shrubs,roses,alpines and waterside    
 plants with fairly extensive areas of 
 grass.                                
   The garden has provided a suitable  
 venue for village events,particularly 
 Church Fetes,and for other fund-      
 raising activities such as the Council
 for the Protection of Rural England.  
 The garden is also opened twice a year
 for the National Garden Scheme        
 Charities. It has given pleasure to   
 many people.
