		<title>17Scotch Corner Hotel-contd</title>
		<content> The hotel caters for foreign tourists 
 as well as national and local         
 visitors. It is also a busy local     
 meeting place for local business men  
 and farmers and also hosts many local 
 social group functions which include  
 dinners and dances for the locality.  
 There is accommodation for 360 guests.
 The hotel is considered to be a part  
 of the village community and employs a
 number of Middleton Tyas and other    
 local people.                         
                                       
 Like all similar busy hotels, the     
 staff work long hours and much of the 
 work can be physically tiring. Besides
 the bedroom accommodation the hotel   
 contains restaurant and bar facilities
 which include the recently opened     
{Bedale Carvery.}
