		<title>16Industrial Estate, Clacton</title>
		<content>    {Gorse Lane Industrial Estate}was a
 clean estate when it first opened, but
 now it has turned into a place where  
 there's nothing but rubbish. Most of  
 the factories are not used or have    
 closed down.                          
                                       
     There has been a report on the    
 estate in a local newspaper which said
 that it is dirty, scruffy and there's 
 lots of overgrown weeds with the      
 rubbish.                              
                                       
     The council said only 10 units    
 closed out of 110 small units isn't   
 bad at all, but the larger units on   
 the site and in Davey road were not   
 included in those figures.            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
