		<content> Originally the Broxbournebury estate  
 was 1600 acres. Today a Special School
 the building stands in 80 acres of    
 parkland &amp; woods with 2 lakes. Fishing
 rights for carp, tench etc. are held  
 by the Council. In the grounds stable 
 cottages, a 4 flat stable conversion, 
 a huntsman's cottage, the South Lodge 
 &amp; 2 modern houses are used by staff,  
 etc. The schoolchildren enjoy the     
 estate especially their adventure     
 playground and the woods where an ice-
 house deep in a frost hollow, formerly
 used to store venison, etc. is now    
 used as a 'hidey' place ! Local       
 schools hold their District Sports    
 &amp; Rounders Competitions in the grounds
 &amp; Guides enjoy camping too. Once a    
 year over 3000 people visit to enjoy  
 the Extravaganza, a fund raising fete 
 for the School, when sideshows, amuse-
 ments &amp; picnics make a happy day !    </content>
