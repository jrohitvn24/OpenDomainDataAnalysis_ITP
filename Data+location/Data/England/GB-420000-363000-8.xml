		<content> Just over 40% of the houses in        
 Youlgrave are detached; a similar     
 percentage are semi-detached. Most    
 houses are built of natural stone,    
 usually local limestone. Houses are   
 never built of red brick because the  
 Peak Park Board won't allow it. 66% of
 homes have central heating and many   
 have coal fires. 20% have double      
 glazing but a lot of the older houses 
 maintain tradition by keeping little  
 square windows. 80% of the population 
 live in a house and nearly 75% are    
 owner-occupiers. Nearly half of the   
 houses were built pre-1900 and only a 
 quarter have been built since 1945.   
 More than half the families in        
 Youlgrave have lived in the village   
 for over 30 years. Almost all the     
 homes have a fridge, 80% have a       
 washing machine and 66% have freezers.
