 Ironside Rd. experienced a woman      
 grabbing hold of his wrists.He hit her
 and she disappeared.A women           
 experienced her dead husband          
 at the side of her. Some policemen on 
 the beat at night once saw a carraige 
 and horses two feet off the ground.   
 Then there was a woman who, when      
 she was ten,went upstairs and saw a   
 shadow of someone dressed in a long   
 black gown with a feather in her      
 hat.Her sister was always dressing uo 
 and trying to scare her so she started
 shouting "come down from the attic"   
 but there was no answer.The girl      
 became scared.Then she heard a bang   
 downstairs. It was her sister coming  
 in. The girl rushed downstairs to find
 that her sister had been out of the   
 house all day-it must have been a     
 ghost!                                </content>
