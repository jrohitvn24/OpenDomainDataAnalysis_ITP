		<content> THE KENNELS                           
 Mr. and Mrs. Crane have about twenty  
 individual kennels at their premises. 
 The land they own is about two thirds 
 of an acre. The number of dogs and    
 cats they take in varies throughout   
 the year. The don't get many cats in  
 but in the summer they accommodate    
 about 35 dogs per week. In the winter 
 they don't get very many dogs either. 
 The fees are Â£2.20 per day but for    
 Irish Wolf-Hounds and Great Danes they
 charge Â£3.50. The price difference is 
 due to the extra feeding costs. The   
 amount of food the dogs eat varies    
 with size. The age range of the dogs  
 is from 18 months to 10 years. About  
 50% of the dogs they take in are      
 mongrels with the remaining 50% being 
 pedegree.
