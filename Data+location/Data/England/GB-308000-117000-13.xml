{Murder at the church door.            
 A long time ago there was a murder at 
 Sampford church, involving Nicholas   
 Arundel. He was the lord of the manor 
 and was disliked by many of the       
 villagers. Some of them decided to    
 attack the manor house. Nicholas      
 escaped and ran to the church for     
 safety but the vicar would not let him
 in.When the villagers caught  up with 
 him they killed him in front of the   
 church porch.  They were put on trial 
 and twenty-five of them were hanged.
