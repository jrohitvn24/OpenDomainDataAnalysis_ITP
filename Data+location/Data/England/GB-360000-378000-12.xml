		<title>12Pits and Ponds in Whitley</title>
		<content> There are many different sizes of pits
 and ponds in Whitley and they are a   
 great feature in the landscape of the 
 village.  The larger ones were started
 by local{sand}extracting firms in 1936
 After 24 years of use the last lorry  
 loads left in the 1960's.Over 80 acres
 of farm land was lost,many were filled
 with water or rubbish.  Lately the    
 largest rubbish tip has been reclaimed
 by the council and it is now good     
 farming land again.                   
 The small pits were often dug out by  
 farmers for marl to fertilise the land
 The side walls were sometimes blown   
 down by dynamite. After the nineteenth
 century most marl pits were out of use
 because farmers found lime a better   
 fertiliser.Some clay was used for the 
 canals and some for bricks. The pits  
 were used by children for swimming.   
 Most are now fishing ponds or derelict</content>
