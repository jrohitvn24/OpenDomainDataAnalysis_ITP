		<title>14The Pig Farm Landscove</title>
		<content> This is situated at Beara Farm and    
 covers an area of 5.5 acres.There are 
 three main 'houses' and a smaller     
 house for pregnant sows and new       
 litters. The amount of light and heat 
 is carefully controlled and the feed  
 is in the form of a liquified         
 'porridge' specially formulated by the
{farmer}for maximum growth.Most of the 
{pigs}go for slaughter at about six    
 months ,to the Harris{Bacon}Factory in
 Totnes,but a few go to local people   
 and butchers for{pork}Mr.and Mrs.Hext 
 and their two sons run the farm and   
 appeared on a television programme to 
 explain their work.Some parents buy   
 half a pig for about Â£30 to store in  
 their freezers and enjoy the excellent
 quality meat over a period of six     
 months or so.
