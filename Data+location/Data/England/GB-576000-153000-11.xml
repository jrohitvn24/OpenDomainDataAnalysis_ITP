		<title>11THE POLICE H.Q., MAIDSTONE</title>
		<content> The headquarters in the Sutton Road is
 the communications and administrative 
 centre for the Kent County            
 Constabulary. The original building   
 came into use in 1939 but the         
 operations room dates from 1976. The  
 most recent addition is a second      
 aerial mast adjacent to the operations
 room and it is hoped that this will   
 overcome previous difficulties with   
 interference from France.             
   The operations room is manned in    
 shifts of eight hours, each watch is  
 under control of a duty inspector.    
 There are direct links with the       
 national police computer at Hendon for
 immediate vehicle and person checks.  
 Emergency and 999 calls are handled   
 here. Two-way radio links with police 
 vehicles are dealt with at four       
 consoles according to the car's       
 geographical position.                </content>
