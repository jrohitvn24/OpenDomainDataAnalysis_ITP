		<content>There is a Meals on Wheels service and 
an Over 60 Club held fortnightly. There
are no Old People's Homes, elderly folk
needing care usually going to Steven-  
age. There is not a great deal for the 
youth of the village. There is a Youth 
Club on Fridays and a Sports Club.     
There is no Doctor or Dentist. Parents 
take their children to a Health Clinic 
in Walkern.                            
Surprisingly there are more modern than
older houses in Benington.The new hous-
ing tends to be up-market. All housing 
is relatively expensive.               
A Herts C.C. Library Van calls weekly. 
There are no Banking facilities.       
There are several active clubs: British
Legion, Brownies, Scouts, Cubs, Guides,
Cricket, Soccer &amp; Badminton. There are 
inter-village competitions.            
Benington has its own policeman, living
in a police house in the village.      </content>
