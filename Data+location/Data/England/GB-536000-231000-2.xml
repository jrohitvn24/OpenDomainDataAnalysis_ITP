		<content> Rainfall averages 840mm.per year. East
 winds can bring problems by drifting  
 snow,blocking roads in winter.        
  The area consists of pleasant        
 undulating countryside, most of which 
 is arable farmland. There are several 
 small blocks of deciduous woodland.   
 The scenery is open and unspectacular.
 Fields are fairly large. Most of the  
 hedgerows have been removed or cut to 
 ground level, especially in the north 
 and west of the block. In the east    
 small streams feeding the River Quin  
 are bordered by bushes to some extent,
 but these are small re_growths.       
 Standard trees often show damage from 
 stubble burning.There are many        
 footpaths and bridleways but they have
 little relevance to present day life  
 except as a means of recreation. Their
 continued existence depends on the    
 persistence of walkers.               </content>
