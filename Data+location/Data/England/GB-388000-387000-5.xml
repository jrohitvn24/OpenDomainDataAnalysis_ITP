		<content>   The Davenport Theatre has been      
 forced to widen its sphere of         
 entertainment in order to avoid       
 closure. Today, as well as plays by   
 local and regional drama groups, it   
 also puts on a Christmas pantomime    
 starring a popular figure,and arranges
 concerts of popular and classical     
 music. Its main attractions are films.
 Two films a week are shown, one on the
 larger screen, and another in a minor 
 theatre which only seats 150 people.  
 The theatre is also used during the   
 daytime for conferences and one of the
 local schools uses it for Speech Day. 
{WHAT'S ON?-}At Christmas, Ken Dodd    
 starred in the "Aladdin" pantomime.   
 Recent films are "Passage to India",  
 "Police Academy" and "The Killing     
 Fields". Future stage shows include a 
 "Jazz and Blues" night with Acker     
 Bilk, Chris Barber and Kenny Ball.    </content>
