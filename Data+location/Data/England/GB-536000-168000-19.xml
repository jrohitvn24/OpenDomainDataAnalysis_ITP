		<content> A survey was carried out in roads     
 close to Cator Park School to identify
 and count the numbers of trees lining 
 the roads, with the following results:
 Alder          19  Horse Chestnut 8   
 Lime           36  Ash            6   
 Sycamore       19  Maple         34   
 London Plane    8  Walnut        11   
 Cherry          6  Oak            2   
                                       
 Fourteen other different types of     
 trees  were also recorded within 100  
 metres of the school.                 
  Many of the footpaths in this area   
 have grass verges and these are       
 frequently planted with trees at      
 intervals. These trees are provided   
 and maintained by the local authority.
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
