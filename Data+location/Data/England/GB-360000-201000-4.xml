		<content>    Whereever the name of Lydney is    
 mentioned the conversation will       
 probably turn to rugby.For a town with
 about eight thousand inhabitants      
 Lydney's record in recent seasons is  
 remarkable.The club has reached the   
 third round of the John Player Cup    
 regularly and this year lost only to  
 Sale,the leading English club in the  
 fourth round.Five internationals in   
 recent times also gives local pride.  
    The club normally fields three     
 senior fifteens,a Colts team and a    
 number of junior mini-rugby sides.    
    In 1987 Lydney will celebrate its  
 centenary.Preparations are already in 
 hand for special matches against top  
 sides to supplement the already strong
 fixture list.With its excellent       
 facilities and great enthusiasm the   
 second hundred years should be as     
 successful as the first.              </content>
