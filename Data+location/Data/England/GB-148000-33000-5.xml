		<title>05The day of a farmer's son 2</title>
		<content> From 8.30-4.30 I am in school slaving 
 away and am glad to get home to work  
 on the farm with my brother Paul and  
 my Dad. When I have reached the gate  
 to the farm I see (just over the      
 bottom hedge) that they are planting  
 brocoli. This is when I realize that I
 am needed."Quickly", says my          
 Mum."You're needed on the planter". If
 it was any other job I wouldn't be in 
 such a hurry to get to the field. But 
 in this case I was in no mood for     
 drinking coffee and eating biscuits. I
 quickly run up from the Court House   
 and rush upstairs to get changed into 
 my working clothes. It's then         
 downstairs again to put on my working 
 overall. In no time at all I'm out on 
 the planter taking over from my       
 Grandad who is ready to give up his   
 place for younger hands.
