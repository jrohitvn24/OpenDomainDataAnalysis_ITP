		<title>14MILKING AND CALVING</title>
		<content> Each cow is milked at Copthall Farm   
 twice a day and supposedly should     
 produce 5,000 litres per cow a year.  
 The milking parlour used to be a      
 milking shed but was converted in 1970
 to its present use. 6 cows can be     
 milked at one time.When the milk has  
 been collected from the cows into the 
 milk churn, it is put onto a lorry and
 driven to Daltons Farm and delivered  
 to the homes.Daltons Farm, Copthall   
 Farm  and another farm are all        
 connected.                            
 The cows calf all year round. They    
 have a nine month gestation period.   
 When the calves are born,they are     
 taken away from their mothers. They   
 drink the milk before it is pasturised
 although it is unnaturally fed to them
 by hand.
