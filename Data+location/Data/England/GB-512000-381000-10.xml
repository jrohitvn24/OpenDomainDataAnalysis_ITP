		<title>10FARMERS WIFE</title>
		<content>    A farmer's wife in {West Torrington
 gets up shortly before 7am, and is    
 then occupied with packing lunches and
 preparing breakfast for the family.   
 She and the three children leave home 
 at 8.10am to meet the school buses in 
{West Torrington,}about a mile away. By
 8.30am she is home, doing housework   
 and preparing breakfast for her       
 husband when he comes in at 9.30am.   
 The rest of the morning is spent in   
 housework, except one morning, when   
 she shops and collects money for the  
 men's wages from the bank in Lincoln, 
 15 miles away. She spends another     
 morning, doing office work for the    
 farm. Lunch is usually a snack meal   
 when her husband comes in at about    
 1pm.                                  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
