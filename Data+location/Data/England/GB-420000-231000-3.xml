		<title>03FIRE COLLEGE LIFE AT MORETON</title>
		<content>  The{Fire College}is important to     
 Moreton,because it employs many of the
 population (14% of parents in a class 
 survey).It has a sports complex at the
 college. This consists of a swimming  
 pool, tennis courts, volleyball       
 courts, badminton courts and two      
 full size football pitches. It is open
 to the public at weekends.To gain     
 entrance to the sports complex you    
 need a membership pass. We interviewed
 a fireman's{family.}They like it at   
 the college because there are lots of 
{activities}to do and you meet lots of 
 different people.Their favourite thing
 at the college is the sports complex  
 where they swim or play games.The     
 mother does not like the house because
 it is not designed well.The father is 
 a lecturer and he teaches on hazardous
 substances.The family has lived there 
 15 months.                            </content>
