		<content> The Cockermouth Anglers have the      
 sporting rights on Cogra Moss. The    
 lake belongs to the North West Water  
 Authority. Fishing is closed from the 
 30th Sept. to 1st April. The          
 Association has 75 members, there is  
 no age limit. To join you apply to the
 secretary to go onto a waiting list.  
 To fish you need a rod, fly line,     
 nylon for the cast, landing net,      
 priest and flies. Rainbow Trout don't 
 live in the lake naturally but some   
 Brown Trout and Perch do. The club    
 puts about 300 fish in the lake every 
 2 weeks which they buy from Gilcrux   
 Lake District Trout Farm and Marron   
 Fish Farm at Braithwaite. The fish    
 weigh about 1 pound and when they are 
 caught they are still about the same  
 weight. Some of the birds at Cogra    
 Moss are, Common Sand Piper, Mallard, 
 Coot and a pair of Crested Grebes.    </content>
