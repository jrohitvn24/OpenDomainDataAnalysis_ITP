		<title>08THE WARREN</title>
		<content> The Warren is an area of 13 acres to  
 the S. of Toft Hill &amp; just inside the 
 National Park. It is owned by Stockton
 &amp; Thornaby District Scout Council     
 which bought it in 1977. The building,
 once a gamekeeper's cottage, is now   
 used as an ablutions block. There is  
 no piped water supply &amp; no            
 electricity. Water is from a spring &amp; 
 is purified. There is a septic tank.  
 The 2 ponds which are surrounded by   
 daffodils have been filled with newts 
 &amp; sticklebacks. The National Parks    
 Committee provided the 1000 or so     
 young trees that the Scouts planted   
 around the site. The site is used by  
 Cubs, Brownies &amp; Scouts from Stokesley
 &amp; Cubs from Kirby for evening meetings
 in Summer. It is used by Stockton &amp;   
 Thornaby Venture Scouts, Scouts &amp; Cubs
 for weekend camps &amp; other activities. 
 The area is grass, gorse &amp; some sedge.</content>
