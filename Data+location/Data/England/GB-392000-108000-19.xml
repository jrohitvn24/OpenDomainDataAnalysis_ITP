 In the SW corner of our block is      
 Blandford camp.As only a small part of
 the camp is in our block we decided to
 leave the details to the people doing 
 the block next to ours.The army have  
 had a camp there since the Civil War  
 in 1642.A hutted camp was built at    
 Collingwood corner in our block since 
 the first world war and the name      
 Collingwood comes from a Navy admaral.
 The Americans had a hospital on the   
 site during the second world war but  
 the School of Signals Regiment which  
 is there now is stationed in a new    
 camp built between 1964 and 1971.Also 
 in the area is Race Down and it is    
 here that they held horse racing and  
 motor cycle racing in the past but all
 that is finished now.
