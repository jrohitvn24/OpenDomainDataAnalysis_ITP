		<title>17FARMING: Lepton</title>
		<content>    There are many{farms}in the area.  
 These farms usually have{beef or dairy
{cattle.}Also, there are some very     
 small farms and{smallholdings}where   
 people keep just a few animals. More  
{horses}are seen in the area now,      
 reflecting the popularity of{riding.} 
                                       
    These are some{thoughts}from a boy 
 who lives and works on a{30 acre farm 
 The day begins early and ends late for
 him, especially in the winter. In     
 summer, he is outside a lot,          
 especially during{haymaking.}He and   
 about 7 others help with this work. It
 is hard, but they have a break during 
 which they drink beer given to them.  
 He likes the busy life on the farm,   
 and the{closeness of the animals.}    
    There is always something          
 happening, and he wouldn't want to    
 live in a town.                       </content>
