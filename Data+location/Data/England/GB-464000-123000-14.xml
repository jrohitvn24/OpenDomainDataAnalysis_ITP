		<title>14THE POLICEMAN - WEST MEON</title>
		<content>    I have an interesting and varied   
 life, forming part of a team of five  
 Policeman, responsible for policing an
 area from Southwick to West Meon.     
   On average there are twenty crimes  
 reported in my area each year and     
 crime plays only a small part in my   
 working life.                         
   Daily duties include working both at
 Fareham and Droxford Police Stations, 
 in my colleagues' villages and in my  
 own village. In addition, I must be   
 prepared to go anywhere in England and
 Wales for duties such as riot control.
   Incidents through the day are       
 varied. My roles include those of     
 adviser, social worker, enquiry agent,
 law enforcer and friend. It is fair   
 to say that I must be prepared to deal
 with anything and my work is          
 challenging and never dull. If I can  
 help I will.          ANDY MORLEY     </content>
