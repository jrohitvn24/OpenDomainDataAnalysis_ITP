{A report by Darren George.            
{                                      
 Mr.Sharp has owned Ballards for 13yrs.
 The shop is called Ballards because   
 the previous owners were called       
 Ballards.It has always been a general 
 store since the early 1700's.Mr.Sharp 
 employs two full time workers,three   
 part time workers and four paper      
 boys.The shop is open from            
 8.45am-1.00pm and from 2.00pm-5.30pm  
 Mon-Fri and 8.45am-Noon on Saturday.  
 Mr.Sharp does not think he will ever  
 have to close down because he has     
 survived over the worst period and    
 sells fresh products, which is very   
 convenient especially for the mums    
 with young children.He also sells     
 about 300 papers a day.Mr.Sharp enjoys
 running a general store because he    
 meets lots of people.                 </content>
