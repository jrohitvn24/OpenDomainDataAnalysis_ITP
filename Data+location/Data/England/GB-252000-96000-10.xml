		<title>10HOUSING IN MID DEVON</title>
		<content> Many of the houses are the            
 characteristic 'Devon long house' -   
 two storeys but long and low with a   
 central front porch entrance and      
 painted white. They are normally built
 of cob and stone and the original     
 thatched roof has been replaced by    
 slates. Many are over 400 years old.  
 As the area is  roughly 600/700 feet  
 above sea level most houses have been 
 built either end on to or backing on  
 to the prevailing west wind with the  
 main rooms on the sheltered side.     
 Most of the farms are away from the   
 road at the end of a long lane or     
 drive and often cannot be seen by the 
 passerby. The upkeep and improving of 
 property are major concerns and many  
 householders do much of their own     
 maintenance. There are about 20 farms 
 with their attendant buildings.
