		<title>16CAMERTON AND ITS  CHURCH</title>
		<content> The church of St.Peter was once the   
 only church in the parish of Seaton   
 and Camerton.It stands at the extreme 
 end of the parish and is in the Early 
 English style. It is said to stand on 
 a site where there had been early     
 christian worship for over 1000 years 
 previously. Unlike many churches, the 
 village did not grow up around it, but
 lies some distance away.              
 Consisting of a chancel and chapel,   
 with a western tower, a spire was     
 added in 1855. In the chapel there is 
 an altar tomb, with the effigy of a   
 warrior, known as 'Black Tom of the   
 North', a member of the Curwen family,
 the local landowners.Black Tom is in  
 fact buried in Shap Abbey. He was     
 famous as a bulwark against the       
 marauding border Scots raiders.       
 During a restoration in 1892,ancient  
 stones were discovered.               </content>
