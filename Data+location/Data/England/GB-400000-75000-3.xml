		<content>      To help the public and to provide
 information, and generally look after 
 the Country Park, there is a Warden   
 Service. This is based at the         
 Information Centre.                   
      The Information Centre consists  
 of a large stone bungalow style       
 building with toilet facilities,      
 exhibition areas, a large patio and   
 rooms for use as offices, and a slide/
 film area.                            
      Constantly changing exhibits     
 include a monthly board. Large        
 permanent exhibits include maps and   
 models showing relief, geology and    
 landscape features. Daily notes are   
 given regarding weather and sightings 
 of special interest.
