		<title>16WIDEWELL SCHOOL SUMMER FAIR</title>
		<content> Every year at the end of the summer   
 term we have our summer fair at       
 school. This year it was held on      
 Saturday July 13th starting at        
 2.00pm.There were lots of stalls and  
 games there. Some of the stalls       
 were:handicrafts, cakes, sweets,      
 books, toys, tombola, white           
 elephant,jewellery and cosmetics. The 
 games were: hoopla, have your face    
 painted, score a goal, pick a straw,  
 get three balls in a hole, buzz       
 off,treasure hunt and lucky dip. There
 were refreshments and a raffle. The   
 first prize was a flight for two to   
 Jersey from Brymon Airways. We had a  
 five a side football match with boys  
 playing against parents and staff. The
 boys won 4_0, but their goal was much 
 wider! We made over Â£700 at the fair  
 and the money will be used to buy two 
 video recorders for use in school.    </content>
