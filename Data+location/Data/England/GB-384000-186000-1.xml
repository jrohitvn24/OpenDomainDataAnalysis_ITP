 borders,  the area is farm land on    
 Southern fringe of the Cotswolds, and 
 designated as an{Area of Outstanding  
{Natural Beauty. }It is traversed by B 
 4040 the old Bristol road, much       
 quieter now since construction of M 4 
 took heavy traffic away.              
   The northern half of{Sherston,      
 including Manor Close, a new housing  
 estate, the hamlets of Pinkney in the 
 south and Willesley in the north      
 comprise the only residential areas.  
 Dotted with{farms,}land use is divided
 between arable and grazing for dairy  
 herds or store cattle.                
   Older houses are built of natural   
 stone with stone tiled roofs, drystone
 walls are feature of landscape, which 
 has lost many trees from Dutch Elm    
 disease in recent years.
