		<title>20THE RETAIL TRADE</title>
		<content> The future of the south of the area   
 will depend mainly on tourism and the 
 wealth brought into the area by       
 residents who work in London.This may 
 mean a lessening of ordinary          
 facilities-Eton High Street and       
 Datchet have lost many small shops    
 serving local needs and antique shops 
 and restaurants proliferate.House     
 prices make it difficult for anyone to
 enter the area from the Midlands or   
 the North.                            
  In the north of the area the once    
 prosperous trading estate has many    
 empty premises leading to loss of     
 employment The depression here is made
 more noticeable by the surrounding    
 prosperity.A generous face-lift to the
 town centre may bring in some of the  
 money available in the area for while 
 Slough retracts,near-by Reading's     
 retail trade continues to expand.     </content>
