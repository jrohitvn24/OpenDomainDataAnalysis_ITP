		<content>  Life as a{Jehovah's Witness}can      
 sometimes be difficult as well as     
 rewarding.  The rewarding part is the 
 assemblies where you get to meet lots 
 of friendly people and even see some  
 clever dramas.                        
  Every Thursday and Sunday we have    
 assemblies at the{Kingdom Hall. }Here 
 a speaker talks to us about Jehovah   
 and we read our book called{THE WATCH 
{TOWER.} There are also dramas put on  
 at the Kingdom Hall, in May 1985 we   
 had one about Pentecost, which was    
 great fun but also helped you         
 understand and learn about Pentecost. 
  We also have house meetings on       
 Tuesdays when we study a book called  
{Survival Into a New Earth.            
  A difficult thing is that witnesses  
 are supposed to preach to people every
 day.  By DAVID TURFORD &amp; SARAH WILDE.
