		<content>   Most of the section has water from  
 Wessex Water(a few from S.W.Water by a
 new pipeline). Sewerage and Environ-  
 mental Rates are paid to S.W.W.A. Some
 farms and other dwellings have their  
 own spring or well-water supplies.    
 Many more have their own septic tanks 
 instead of main drainage.             
   Most farms and houses have elec-    
 tricity from S.W.E.B. mains, but a few
 generate their own. CEGB pylons are a 
 feature of the landscape.             
   There is no mains gas supply, but   
 considerable use of cylinder gas.     
   The telephone is essential in such  
 an area-only about 6 dwellings are    
 without one.There is no public tele-  
 phone.In Brushford there are 2 daily  
 postal deliveries; in the outlying    
 areas, one.The Postman is usually     
 willing to collect mail.
