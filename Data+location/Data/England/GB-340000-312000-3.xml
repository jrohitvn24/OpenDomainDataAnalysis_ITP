		<title>03HOUSING IN FORD</title>
		<content> Looking at an old map of{FORD}from    
 around 1926 and comparing it with the 
 revised map from around 1957,it seems 
 that most of the houses around now are
 recently built and not old.The price  
 of the council houses around          
 there,depending on size,range from    
 small ones priced at about Â£22,000,to 
 large very expensive ones at about    
 Â£100,000.                             
    At the most northerly end of{BUTT  
{LANE},which runs through the village, 
 on the westerly side is the{FORD      
{CLINIC.}On the map of 1957 the{CLINIC 
 was a vicarage and was on the map     
 of 1926.On the{LEASOWES }is a major   
 council housing estate.Opposite this  
 on the other side of{BUTT LANE }are  a
 group of old peoples homes  with a    
 Community Room,called{WEST VIEW .     
 There are several farms as well .
