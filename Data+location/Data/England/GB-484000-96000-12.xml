		<content>      In Sidlesham there are two       
 religous meeting places.There is  the 
 parish church of Saint Mary,the vicar 
 is Canon Hawkins.   Saint Marys is    
 about 700 years old some of it was    
 restored in 1746. About two years ago 
 the methodist chapel closed  because  
 it was not safe. Roman Catholics and  
 free church christians have to worship
 in Selsey or Chichester.  Other groups
 such as muslims would have to go      
 further afield.  Sometimes lay readers
 and priests from other churches       
 assist with services.                 
      About forty-five people attend   
 the Sunday services.  In a whole year 
 there is an average of six weddings,  
 eight baptisms and twelve funerals.   
 There are also special services like  
  Harvest Festival, Remembrance Day and
 the Guides Thinking Day.
