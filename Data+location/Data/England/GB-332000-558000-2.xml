		<title>02Landscape - Kirkandrews</title>
		<content>    There is a Roman Wall under the    
 footpath which runs from              
 Kirkandrews-on-Eden to Beaumont. We   
 often walk along this footpath as it  
 runs between our school and the River 
 Eden. Being on the Roman Wall it is   
 high and on a clear day we can see    
 from Criffel in the north west to     
 Cross Fell in the south east. Down a  
 steep bank, ninety eight metres away  
 from the path and across a meadow, is 
 the River Eden. Here it is a tidal    
 river and is famous for salmon        
 fishing.                              
    The view from the footpath is over 
 pleasant open countryside with only   
 the tops of high buildings and        
 Carlisle Cathedral seen in the south  
 east. There are a few trees on the    
 lower land, the higher fells being    
 barren. The fields are small and      
 separated by hawthorn hedges.         </content>
