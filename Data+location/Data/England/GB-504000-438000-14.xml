		<title>14Weel village near Beverley</title>
		<content> Weel is a tiny village tucked away on 
 the other side of the River Hull. When
 we went on a survey there,we          
 interviewed a few people.  People who 
 live there have to like the           
 countryside and the quiet life.       
      Some people we interviewed       
 said they shop in Hull or Beverley.   
 They would like more local            
 entertainment but they would not like 
 Weel to grow in the future. They would
 like more farming and public houses.  
 The children of Weel are not able to  
 catch buses to school,they have to use
 their own transport.                  
      People who live there seem to be 
 elderly.We saw only two families with 
 children.  Weel is very small,there   
 are about forty houses.  It is very   
 isolated and quiet.
