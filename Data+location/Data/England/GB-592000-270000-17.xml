		<title>17FIRE STATION</title>
		<content>Ixworth, like many rural communities is
not big enough to support a full-time  
fire service. One fire engine is       
stationed permanently in the village.  
When the alarm is raised - usually by a
person dialling 999 on a telephone -   
the operator causes a radio signal to  
be transmitted.11 retained (part-time) 
firemen carry a small pocket receiver  
which makes a 'bleeping' sound. When   
alerted they immediately rush to the   
fire station, where, having noted the  
details they hurry to the scene. They  
aim to be mobile within two minutes.   
Another engine is sent from Elmswell or
Bury. The first to arrive saves life,  
the second, property. A crew of 4 is   
the minimum required. The most         
difficult time to obtain a crew is     
during the day when half the men are   
working out of the village.Two teachers
from the Middle School are firemen.    </content>
