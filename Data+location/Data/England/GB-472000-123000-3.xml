		<title>03VILLAGES NEAR PETERSFIELD 1</title>
		<content>{Sheet}is a village on the eastern edge
 of Petersfield. It is older than the  
 town of Petersfield. There is a fine  
 horse chestnut tree on the village    
 green which was planted for Queen     
 Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in l887.   
 The narrow Village Street was once the
 main London to Portsmouth road, until 
 the A3 road was made in the l8th      
 Century. Mill Lane has quite a lot of 
 old attractive cottages near the river
 Rother and two old water mills. A     
 timber-framed house opposite dates    
 from about l600.                      
 The Priest-in-charge of St. Mary's    
 Church holds a picnic each year for   
 the children and adults who go to the 
 church. There is a puppet show and    
 pony rides and the game Treasure Hunt.
 It is very exciting and good fun.     
 St. Mary's is a daughter church of St.
 Peter's.                              </content>
