		<title>10CHANGING COMMUNITIES</title>
		<content> Transport is the main change in       
 village life,as it enables people to  
 mix with other communities.Where      
 families were inter-related,new blood 
 has been brought in;changing names and
 skills.Farmers wives were very much   
 part of the farm life but are now more
 independent and follow their own ideas
 Finance is another area of change.    
 Farmers who once employed ten men, now
 due to modern machinery only employ   
 two.Consequently workers are in better
 financial position.Fashion is often   
 behind the times. An interest in      
 clothes lacking except in the young.  
 Elderly people seem to disapprove of  
 the freedom of the younger community  
 and their values towards money,       
 marriage and social benefits.The      
 younger generation,frustrated, leave  
 the village but eventually return -   
 life at home isn't that bad.          </content>
