		<title>02HORNBY VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Hornby is a very small,quiet village  
 set amongst farm land.The main        
 building in Hornby is the castle.The  
 village was built around the castle.  
 There is a church.It probably came    
 with the castle along time ago. There 
 is a new estate next to the old       
 vicarage.It is called Park Chase.There
 are 6 houses in it and 23 people live 
 there.Hornby Castle has got its own   
 water supply.It comes from the fields 
 and goes to the castle and some of the
 estate houses.There is an old gas     
 house.It is where they used to make   
 gas.There are some very old cottages  
 in front of the church.They were built
 in the 10th century.One of them is the
 castle's old laundry.Much of the life 
 today in Hornby still centres round   
 the castle and the church.
