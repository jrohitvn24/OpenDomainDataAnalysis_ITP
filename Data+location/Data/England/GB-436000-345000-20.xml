		<content>    Lines written by pupils of         
 Denby Street Lane Primary School:     
                                       
    Jane Moss is a girl in our class   
 and she lives at Park Hall Farm.It    
 was built in 1544 and added to in     
 1702.It is a Craft Centre as well as  
 a farm,the workshops being in the     
 old stables.                          
    At the Centre they make dolls'     
 houses.The ones we saw were St.       
 George's Hall and two traditional     
 ones.One of these had a doll inside,  
 so we looked it up in the Dolls'      
 Emporium-she was Mrs.William.St.      
 George's Hall was white with beautiful
 rooms and furniture,including two tiny
 bottles of wine.                      
    They also make Dalewood design     
 furniture,Barbican wooden signs and   
 glass doors at the Craft Centre.
