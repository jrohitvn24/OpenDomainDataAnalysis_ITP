		<title>09The Village Blacksmiths.</title>
		<content>    Mr.G.Perkin,the Endon blacksmith,no
longer shoes horses.His main business  
now involves repairing agricultural    
machinery.One of his tasks at the      
moment is to make a new wrought iron   
sign for the village.This will stand on
a wooden post at the entrance to the   
village,on the Leek side.Many visitors 
travelling to the National Garden      
Festival in Stoke next year,will pass  
through Endon,so the Parish Council    
commissioned a new sign.Now Mr.Perkin  
has an electric forge with an electric 
fan,instead of hand held bellows. For  
joining metals he has several types of 
welders,including an oxy-acetylene and 
a gas one.Recently,he purchased a power
hammer which can be used to sharpen    
steel compressors from road drills.Mr. 
Perkin also sells barbed wire for      
fences,gate hooks,nails,bolts and      
brushes,mainly to local farmers.       </content>
