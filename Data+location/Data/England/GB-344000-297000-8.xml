		<content>  Village halls are the focal point of 
 social life.Functions held include    
 Charity dances,Bring &amp; Buy sales,Punch
 &amp; Pate evenings and whist drives.     
  A weekly playgroup and a Social Group
 for Elderly Persons is held in Leebot-
 wood's Village Hall, whilst Smethcott 
 has a Bible Holiday Club for one week 
 per year, which is well attended by   
 children up to teenage.               
  Most women belong to the Women's     
 Institute and the old traditional     
 pastimes are popular.Sewing,knitting, 
 embroidery and tapestry work together 
 with cooking,gardening and reading,   
 compete strongly against the variety  
 of evening classes offered in local   
 towns.There is a keen Young Farmers'  
 Club offering a full range of crafts  
 and recreations.These include foreign 
 exchange visits to Israel, Canada,    
 France and Germany.                   </content>
