		<content> The{National Gas Turbine Establishment
 is the United Kingdom centre for      
{research}and{development}in{gas       
{turbine technology.}This work began in
 1942, and in 1946, following a merger 
 with Frank Whittle's team, the NGTE   
 was born. The main research done here 
 is on the gas turbine engine for land,
 sea and air use, but problems such as 
 aircraft noise are also investigated. 
 The work provides employment for many 
 people, the majority of whom are      
{scientific and technical engineers. }
