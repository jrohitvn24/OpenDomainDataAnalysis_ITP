		<content> The Sixties style building replaced a 
 Victorian school after an Inspection  
 (1969/70) stated that the school did  
 not meet statutory requirements. The  
 mixed Infant/Junior school has on     
 average 180-200 children divided into 
 6 classes according to age, plus a    
 Nursery class operating morning and   
 afternoon sessions for  20 children   
 each. There is a staff of 6 teachers  
 plus a half-time Infants teacher and 2
 visiting teachers of Music and Science
 attending for a half day. The Deputy  
 Head, who retired in July, has not yet
 been replaced because the 40          
 applicants were not considered of a   
 sufficiently high standard.           
  All except about a dozen pupils stay 
 at school for lunch, about 40% eating 
 school lunches and 60% bringing a     
 packed lunch.
