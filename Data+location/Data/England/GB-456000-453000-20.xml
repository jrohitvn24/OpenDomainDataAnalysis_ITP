		<title>20Sugar Beet Factory : York</title>
		<content> York Sugar Beet Factory has been      
 producing sugar since 1926 .The       
 Factory generates its own power by    
 means of generators that burn gas. The
 sugar beet is grown locally and       
 delivered by road and not rail as in  
 previous years. It takes 12 hours to  
 produce sugar and 650 tonnes a day is 
 produced during the campaign. 100     
 tonnes of beet produces 15 tonnes of  
 sugar. White sugar only is made in    
 this factory and molasses and beet    
 pulp for animal feed is also made.    
 After the sugar is processed it is    
 taken to supermarkets, retail outlets 
 and factories. During the off season  
 280 people work in the factory and 460
 during the campaign. In the campaign  
 the factory is open 7 days a week and 
 5 days in the off season. 78000 tonnes
 of sugar is produced in the factory   
 each year.                            </content>
