		<content> Flitwick Mill - a working watermill   
                                       
 Flitwick Mill is one of the few       
 watermills still at work in the       
 country. It is embanked some 12 ft.   
 above  the surrounding meadows. Water 
 supply has often been a problem       
 particularly in the summer at harvest.
  The Mill-work is important because   
 it is typical of the early 19th       
 century although it has been repaired 
 at various times. The Mill has an iron
 overshot wheel which is 12' wide and  
 10' in diam. The main shaft carries an
 iron pit wheel inside the main wall.  
 This engages with a cast iron wallover
  on the upright shaft. The great spur 
 wheel drives two pairs of stones. A   
 steam engine used to drive a third    
  pair of stones but is today electic- 
 ally operated. The wooden shaft drives
 various machines on the first floor.  </content>
