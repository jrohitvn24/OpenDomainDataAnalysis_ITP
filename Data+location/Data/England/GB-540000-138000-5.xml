		<title>05FARMING</title>
		<content> We talked to several people who worked
 on farms. One man had worked on all   
 kinds of farms but he was really used 
 to a big mixed farm. If he did not    
 have the early morning milking shift  
 he started at about 7a.m. on general  
 maintenance and feeding the stock.Then
 the cows were put out to pasture,     
 electric fences to be checked etc.    
 Later the calves had to be fed and the
 afternoon milking. He preferred work- 
 ing with machinery and the work of    
 arable farming. He really liked sheep 
 and now has a few of his own.         
 Another man was self-employed and trav
 elled up to 20 miles to work.He was   
 very skilled and could do most jobs on
 the farms. He arranged his work care- 
 fully to cut down travel.He worked    
 very hard most of the year and was    
 able to have a good holiday in winter.
