		<title>17Roller Skating.</title>
		<content>    I spend much of my weekend roller  
 skating. I belong to the Thames Valley
 Roller Skating Club. The club is run  
 by Ron and Molly Cuton and has 100    
 members. We use the Old Goal Leisure  
 Centre in Abingdon. We pay for a      
 membership card which lets us use the 
 Old Goal's skating room and hire their
 skates for free.                      
    On Saturday morning I have a lesson
 at 8.30am and then afterwards I       
 continue to skate in the general      
 public sessions where anyone can come 
 in and hire a pair of skates and have 
 a go. The session ends around         
 lunchtime.                            
    On Sunday afternoons I also roller 
 skate, from about 4.30 to 6.30. In    
 this session we play a game and also  
 have some competitions for who can    
 skate the fastest and who can do the  
 most tricks.                          </content>
