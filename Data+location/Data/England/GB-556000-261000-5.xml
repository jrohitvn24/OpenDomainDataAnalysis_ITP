		<title>05ART &amp; CRAFT EXHIBITION</title>
		<content> On 12-14th July there was an Art and  
 Craft Exhibition held in St Cyriac's  
 church, Swaffham Prior. There is an   
 exhibition held every year by         
 tradition. A charge of Â£2 was made for
 visitors to the exhibition. It was    
 free for children and Â£1 for those    
 displaying items. White and red wine  
 was included in the fee. On sale were 
 things like toys, paintings, pottery  
 and models. The proceeds went towards 
 church funds. There was also a raffle.
 In the exhibition were wooden goblets 
 and old plates. There were also plants
 and small garden objects for sale. The
 exhibition was a highlight to the     
 weekend in the village and was fairly 
 well attended.
