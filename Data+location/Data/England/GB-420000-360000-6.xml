		<content>     Diary of a school day.            
                                       
  We start school at 9 o'clock with    
 assembly. One of the Junior children  
 took assembly today; he read about the
 snake. Afterwards Rev. Servante took  
 us for R.E., we then did S.M.P. which 
 is Maths. I really like S.M.P. At 11  
 0'clock, after playtime, we do        
 "Singing Together" from the Radio. We 
 sing and use percussion instruments.  
  At 12 o'clock we clear the classroom 
 and put the tables out ready for      
 dinner. The dinners come from Bakewell
 and are served by the dinner ladies.  
  School starts again at 1.10 p.m.     
 Today we are going to the swimming    
 baths in Matlock. On other afternoons 
 we do P.E. in school using the large  
 apparatus or we go to the playing     
 field. We might do art and craft and  
 then have a story until 3.30 hometime.</content>
