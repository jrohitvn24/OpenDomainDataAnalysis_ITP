		<content>{NYLAND HILL}IS IN THE SOUTHERN END OF 
 OUR {"D BLOCK"},SO WE CLIMBED THE HILL
 TO SEE OUR WHOLE AREA FROM THE TOP.THE
 HILL IS ONLY{252 FEET HIGH},BUT IT IS 
 VERY STEEP,SO IT SEEMED MUCH HIGHER   
 WHEN WE CLIMBED IT,AND THE VIEW FROM  
 THE TOP WAS BEAUTIFUL.WE COULD SEE    
 THAT THE LAND WAS VERY FLAT OVER THE  
 MOORS WHICH COVERS MOST OF THE AREA.  
 THE FARMERS WERE MAKING SILAGE IN LOTS
 OF THE FIELDS. TO THE NORTH OF {      
{DRAYCOTT}THE GROUND BEGAN TO RISE TO  
 THE {MENDIPS,}ON TOP OF THE HILLS WE  
 COULD SEE WOODS AND ROCKY CRAGGS.WE   
 SAW ALL THE {STRAWBERRY FIELDS}AROUND 
 DRAYCOTT, AND EACH SIDE OF THE ROAD TO
 CHEDDAR.THROUGH BINOCULARS WE COULD   
 RECOGNISE SOME OF THE BUILDINGS IN    
 DRAYCOTT, INCLUDING OUR SCHOOL.
