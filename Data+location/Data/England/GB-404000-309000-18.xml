The Work of the Hospital.              
  St.Matthew's Hospital in Burntwood   
was built and opened by the County of  
Stafford in 1864 for mentally ill      
patients.                              
  When it was opened it could take up  
to 1000 patients.There were very large 
wards where many people would be       
crammed together.Those patients who    
were violent or may harm themselves    
were locked up in padded cells.The     
longest time that a patient has stayed 
in the hospital is 60 years.She was not
ill,she was put in the hospital for    
being bad as a child.                  
  The wards are now divided into       
cubicles for privacy.Many patients go  
to the hospital on a day basis for     
treatment of different kinds.The       
patients who do not go out are         
suffering from Senile Dementia.        </content>
