		<content>     HARWICH IS A MAJOR PORT AND IT IS 
 IMPORTANT TO HAVE A STRONG CUSTOMS AND
 EXCISE DEPARTMENT IN THE PORT. A NEW  
 CUSTOMS HOUSE HAS BEEN BUILT IN MAIN  
 ROAD, DOVERCOURT TO HANDLE THE        
 PAPERWORK ACCOMPANYING THE IMPORT AND 
 EXPORT OF SO MANY GOODS THROUGH THE   
 PORT.                                 
     THE UNIFORMED BRANCH CHECK ALL    
 CARGO COMING INTO AND LEAVING THE     
 COUNTRY, AS WELL AS THE PEOPLE.   THEY
 MUST TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT NOBODY     
 TRIES TO SMUGGLE MORE GOODS INTO THE  
 COUNTRY THAN THEY ARE ALLOWED. THEY   
 MUST ALSO CHECK TO STOP DRUG SMUGGLING
 E.G.CANNABIS AND HEROIN.  WITH RABIES 
 OFTEN OCCURRING IN EUROPE IT IS ALSO  
 IMPORTANT THAT CUSTOMS OFFICERS       
 PREVENT PEOPLE BRINGING ANIMALS INTO  
 THE COUNTRY WITHOUT GOING THROUGH A   
 PERIOD OF QUARANTINE.  IN A PORT SUCH 
 AS HARWICH THEY HAVE AN IMPORTANT JOB.</content>
