		<content> The area is composed of Boulder Clay  
 overlying Oxford Clay with Oolitic    
 limestone and Cornbrash exposed east  
   of the village of Stagsden,and      
 Oxford Clay exposed along the valley  
 bottom.The land rises from 118 feet to
 300 feet around Pictshill Gorse.      
 In the area generally intensive       
 farming has resulted in the loss of   
 hedgerows,removal of trees  and       
 woodland during field enlargement,plus
 losses due to elm disease have made   
 the area bleak.However in this area   
 there is still some tree cover        
 notably Hanger Wood  and village trees
 in Stagsden and around the Bird       
 Gardens.The local council consider the
 trees along the road between Stagsden 
 and the a 428 so vital that they are  
 protected by Tree Preservation Orders.
