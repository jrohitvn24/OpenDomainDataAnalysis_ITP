		<title>16The Tower-A Parish Magazine</title>
		<content>    The local Parish magazine is called
 'The Tower' and covers the villages of
 Fryerning, Margaretting, Ingatestone  
 and Buttsbury. It comes out once a    
 month and costs 20 pence. About       
 600 copies of each issue are sold.    
    The overall editor is the Rev.     
 Canon E.F.Hudson of Ingatestone. Major
 Bird looks after the day-to-day       
 working of the magazine and Mr.K.     
 Langford helps to link the Fryerning/ 
 Margaretting information. The cost of 
 producing the magazine is helped by   
 income from advertisements for mainly 
 local shops and services. There are   
 regular letters from the Rector and   
 from the Rev.J.E.Gravelle, the Priest 
 in Charge at Fryerning &amp; Margaretting 
 and many of the local clubs and       
 organisations also have letters and   
 features. The work is mainly voluntary
 and keeps the villagers well informed.</content>
