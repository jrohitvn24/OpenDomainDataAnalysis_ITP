		<title>19"PICK YOUR OWN" at OFFCHURCH</title>
		<content>   One of the popular ways to spend a  
 Summer day in the 1980's is to take   
 the family to a{"Pick Your Own"}Fruit 
 Farm, like the one near Offchurch.  On
 a sunny Saturday, as many as 50 cars  
 can be seen there parked on the grassy
 picnic area with more cars coming and 
 going each minute.                    
  {Each family group}goes first to a   
 large kiosk to receive baskets. People
 then make their way into the nearby   
 fields on foot or wait for one of the 
 tractor pulled{"fruit trains". }On    
 their return to the kiosk the fruit is
 weighed and paid for.
