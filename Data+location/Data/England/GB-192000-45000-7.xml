		<title>07The River Fal : Morphology</title>
		<content>   The River Fal is a 4th order river  
 in this D-block.The river channel was 
 measured North of the bridge at Golden
 Mill. This part of the stream is a    
 gentle meander and its grid reference 
 is 929467 on the O.S. map. The area of
 the cross-section of this part of the 
 river was 1.1sq.m (June) but the      
 cross-section area at bankfull stage  
 was 24.6sq.m.                         
   The maximum depth was 0.31m,the     
 velocity was 1.1m/s and the discharge 
 was 1.2 cubic metres per second.      
   Bedload was randomly sampled across 
 the channel. The middle axis (width)  
 of stones ranged from 1cm-12cm,the    
 average size being between 5cm and    
 6cm.                                  
   The mineral deposits taken in       
 solution in parts per million are as  
 follows:zinc 0.02,sodium 25.7, iron .6
 calcium 9.6,magnesium 58,water's pH7.4</content>
