		<title>13CLUBS AND EVENTS</title>
		<content>    Most of the clubs and events in the
 area take place in the village of West
 Pennard and make use of the Village   
 Hall and school facilities.           
     Clubs include a youth club and a  
 Brownie pack. There is an active      
 Women's Institute, a Parent Teacher   
 Association and the Parochial Church  
 Council. There is a Play Group for pre
 -school children. The cricket club has
 its own grounds and pavillion to the  
 south of the village. A recent        
 innovation is the cycling club which  
 visits local places of interest. There
 are choir practices and bell ringing. 
    Annual events include the church   
 fete, a horse show and a harvest      
 supper. The Blackmore and Sparkford   
 Vale fox hounds meet about twice a    
 year in our area and the Chilmark     
 beagles rather more often.
