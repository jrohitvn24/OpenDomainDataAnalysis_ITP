		<content>      The following figures relate to  
 the Preston,South and West Wards.     
      The{total}number of residents in 
 the three wards was{13350}with 6387   
 (47.8%) males and 6963 (52.2%)        
 females.                              
      Between 1971 and 1981 there was  
 a {fall in}population in two of the   
 areas,{Preston and West},but in the{  
{South Ward}the population has grown by
{33.8%}.This is probably due to the    
 construction of a large new housing   
 estate in the Yew Tree area.          
            Suprisingly,only 21% of the
 population in the South ward was under
 16 years in 1981,whilst about 20% were
 of pensionable age.                   
      Preston Ward has the highest     
 proportion of both young and old      
 people.
