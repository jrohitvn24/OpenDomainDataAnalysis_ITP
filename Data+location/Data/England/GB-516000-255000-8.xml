		<title>08PEOPLE OF LITTLE BARFORD.</title>
		<content>  On Monday June 17th,at 10.05 Miss    
 Dickinson took,Sean,Dean,Darren,Tracy 
 and June to{Little Barford}in her     
 car.The car was parked near an old    
 school and we started to walk along   
 the path next to the main road        
 (B1043).We met an elderly lady her    
 name was Mrs Morris,we said can we ask
 you a few questions.She did'nt        
 mind.First we asked her when the      
 school had been closed down, she said 
 before the war.It had then reopened   
 during the war when the{evacuees}came 
 from Walthamstowe.There was only one  
 teacher who taught all ages.Then we   
 asked who gave permissian to go on the
 bumpy road to the railway and then go 
 up to the hill.The hill used to have a
 cottage and the Bailiff used to live  
 there, but now it has been pulled     
 down.She said the farm manager lives  
 at number four.                       </content>
