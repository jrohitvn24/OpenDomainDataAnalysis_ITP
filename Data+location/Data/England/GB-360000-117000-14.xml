		<content> This school is one of the two primary 
 schools serving Sherborne. It is in   
 the north of the town among the       
 council houses and is known locally as
{Simons Road School.}The main part of  
 the school which the junior age       
 children use was built in 1910: the   
 infants block across the path was     
 added in 1964. There are{240 children 
 on roll aged 5 to 11, most live within
{walking distance}of the school. There 
 are three infant and five junior      
 classes. The school has its own       
 swimming pool and until 1980, when    
 Dorset L.E.A. stopped providing school
 meals for Primary children, had its   
 own school kitchen. School uniform is 
 optional, it consists of white shirts 
 with a green tie, green jumpers and   
 grey skirts or trousers. The school's 
{badge}is a design based on the{cupola}
 at the top of the school roof.        </content>
