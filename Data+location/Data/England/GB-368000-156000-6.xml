		<title>06SKINNER'S JOURNAL</title>
		<content> Born in 1772, John Skinner's career as
 a lawyer lasted only 3 years until he 
 decided to take Holy Orders. After a  
 short curacy at Claverton, in 1800    
 Skinner's uncle purchased for him the 
 living of Camerton.He looked forward  
 to a tranquil life in a peaceful      
 village where he could be both priest 
 and scholar. Instead he encountered   
 strife and unrest in a coalmining     
 community; he was faced with the evils
 of drink, poverty, indiscipline and   
 immorality. He felt bound to tell the 
 people of their faults and was hated  
 for it. He was in constant dispute    
 with the Lord of the Manor. He took   
 refuge in his journals and research   
 into local history, filling 98 vols.  
 of manuscript to be remembered as an  
 antiquary and as a much wronged man.  
 His unhappiness became too much to    
 bear and in 1839 he shot himself.     </content>
