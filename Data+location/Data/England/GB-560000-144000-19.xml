 RECORD HOW THE CHILDREN AT CAPEL      
 SCHOOL UNDERTOOK THIS SURVEY. FIRST WE
 FOUND THAT THE AREA WHERE MOST OF THE 
 CHILDREN LIVED WAS IN THE BLOCK TO BE 
 SURVEYED BY PADDOCK WOOD SCHOOL! WE   
 OFFERRED TO DEAL WITH 4 OF THEIR KM.  
 SQUARES INCLUDING FIVE OAK GREEN AND  
 DID THAT FIRST. OUR BLOCK IS LARGELY  
 INACCESSIBLE WATER MEADOW, FARM AND   
 WOODLAND SO THE LAND COVER AND AMENITY
 COUNTS WERE UNDERTAKEN BY CHILDREN    
 WITH INTREPID PARENTS ONE WEEKEND.  ON
 MONDAY WE COMPARED RESULTS EXCITEDLY. 
 ONE ARDUOUS EXPEDITION TO A SPOT NAMED
 INTRIGUINGLY{"RATS CASTLE"}ON OUR MAPS
