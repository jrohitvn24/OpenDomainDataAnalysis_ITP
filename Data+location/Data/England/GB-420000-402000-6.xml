		<content> is on a Thursday and Huddersfield     
 market is on a Monday. The average cow
 gives 5 gallons a day. The average    
 daily herd is approximately 400       
 gallons. It is collected daily by the 
 Milk Market Board, who take it to the 
 depot, clean and bottle it, and sell  
 it. (Most of the milk in this area is 
 unpasteurized and some farms bottle   
 their own milk and sell it direct to  
 the public or to a local milk round.) 
                                       
 Mr Hirst finds that the main problem  
 affecting his farming is the weather, 
 which can be severe in this area. He  
 occasionally has to call in the local 
 vet; the principal problem with the   
 livestock being pneumonia. Two farm   
 workers are employed on the farm. Mr  
 Hirst has quite a lot of valuable farm
 machinery, including 6 tractors.
