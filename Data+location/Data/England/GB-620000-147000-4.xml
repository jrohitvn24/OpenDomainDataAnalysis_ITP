		<title>04 Barham's Nailbourne Stream.</title>
		<content> The Nailbourne is a{small stream}that 
flows irregularly from Etching Hill,   
where there is a spring, through       
Lyminge, Elham, Barham and on towards  
Kingston.It finally joins the River    
Stour at West Stourmouth.People        
 believed witches caused the Nailbourne
to flow,but we know it is the chalk and
clay ground layers that affect it.Rain 
falls onto the earth and sinks through 
the chalk layer until it reaches clay, 
 on forming a{water table.}The stream  
starts to flow when the ground is      
saturated and the water level is above 
the valley floor,sometimes disappearing
on finding dry chalk,re-emerging when  
it reaches clay.It flows less          
frequently today than in the past,but  
when it does,local people hold races   
on homemade craft.It flooded in Barham 
badly in 1937,1960 and again in 1962.
