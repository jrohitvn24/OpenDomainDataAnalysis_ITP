		<content>  The{shop}has been owned and run by   
 the same{family}for 55 years.Most of  
 the{customers live locally}but because
 it is on a busy road it collects a lot
 of{passing trade}as well. Saturdays   
 and Tuesdays tend to be the busiest.  
 Tuesdays are busy because that is when
{pensions}are paid out.Most of the     
 custom is for bread, milk, fruit,     
 vegetables and small items of grocery.
 Lots of children come in for chocolate
 and ice creams.                       
  The shop is also a{sub- post-office.}
 All of the family is allowed to serve 
 stamps and deal with other post-office
 business but the owner himself, being 
 trained specially to be the sub-      
 postmaster, is in charge and deals    
 with all the accounts.
