		<content> Church's or Mayfield nursery covers 12
 acres. One and a half acres are       
 glasshouses growing tomatoes, lettuce,
 marrows, radish; outside, wheat is    
 grown on 8 acres, with some runner    
 beans. Woodend Farm next door has     
 recently taken over the nursery. Its 3
 workers also work on the nursery.     
 Produce is sold at the farm shop and  
 to local shops. The nursery was       
 started in 1930 by the Belling        
 Electrical Company, to experiment with
 heating glass-houses by electricity.  
 It became Church's in 1960, when it   
 was run by a specialist electrical    
 engineer until 1980.
