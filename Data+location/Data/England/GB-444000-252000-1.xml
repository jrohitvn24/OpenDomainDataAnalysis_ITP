 The area around Wormleighton is       
 largely farm land and this has been   
 its purpose since the original        
 Domesday Book. Three counties meet at 
 a point named Three Shires marked by a
 stone. The counties being             
 Northamptonshire, Warwickshire and    
 Oxfordshire. The South Oxford Canal   
 makes a couple of tortuous appearances
 in its Journey around Wormleighton    
 hill. Also in the area are two sites  
 of villages, outlines of which are    
 visible with the naked eye but from   
 the air these are very clear.         
 Farming consists of grazing and crop  
 growing all of which do well. There   
 are two small sewage farms. The land  
 is owned by Earl Spencer and is farmed
 by tenant farmers except for two farms
 owned privately.
