The brook passes through Brook Hollows,
which is also known as the Spinney.This
was bought by Rolleston Civic Trust    
around 1970.The lake,then known as the 
fish pond, was silted up and J.C.B     
cleaned it out with experimental       
machinery.Wildfowl and swans live on   
the lake and there are many types of   
wildflower,trees and birds.
