		<title>01Colden Common:Introduction</title>
		<content> Most of the block occupies land in the
 parishes of Owslebury and Colden      
 Common.Some of the text refers to the 
 whole block whilst some is specific to
 Colden Common village or to Marwell   
 Zoological Park.                      
 The village of Colden Common,only the 
 eastern part of which falls into this 
 block,lies approximately 4.5 miles    
 south of Winchester and 2.5 miles     
 north-east of Eastleigh.Marwell       
 Zoological Park lies some 1.5 miles   
 east of Colden Common.                
 Much of the information on the village
 was obtained from a sample survey     
 conducted at the summer fete and      
 outside the local shops.The results   
 therefore refer to the whole village  
 and not just that part included in    
 this block.
