		<content>{ Everton}is built on land sloping down
 to the city.  There isn't much left of
 the old village apart from the street 
 name{Village St}and the old{'lock-up'.
                                       
  Today  the area is a suburb of L'pool
 and  it is  changing  from  a{ densely
 populated residential area to an inner
 city{park;}the 1st built this century.
                                       
  The  area  is  very  run down, with a
 large number of{derelict}properties. A
 sample count of maisonettes within the
 boundaries of the proposed park showed
{80%} vacant.  A  large number of these
 properties are{ vandalised} or boarded
 up to stop vandals from wrecking them.
                                       
  3 blocks just outside the area are in
 such condition  they are known as  the
{'piggeries'.} Such  conditions  have  
 created  many  social  problems.      </content>
