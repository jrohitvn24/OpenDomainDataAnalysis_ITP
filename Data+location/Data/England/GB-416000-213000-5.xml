		<title>05SWIMMING IN THE WINDRUSH</title>
		<content>      In the morning we get ready to go
 swimming in the Windrush river.We go  
 all day, so we take our dinner with   
 us.We go to Windrush for my uncles,and
 go down to the river.The river is not 
 very wide,but it is quite deep.       
  Sometimes we bring some inner        
 tubes to float around on.After a good 
 swim we have our dinner on the bank.  
 After dinner we have races on the     
 inner tubes.Sometimes we have jumping 
 competitions.At about 4 o'clock we    
 have our tea.Then we get ourselves    
 dry.We put on our clothes and get     
 ready to leave.We walk through        
 Windrush Manor,down the lane to my    
 Nan's cottage.We get indoors and get  
 change into our clothes,get into the  
 car and go home to Sherborne.
