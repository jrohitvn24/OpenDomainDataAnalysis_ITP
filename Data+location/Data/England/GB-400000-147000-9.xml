		<title>09The Army in Tilshead</title>
		<content> I see the Army when I pass the        
 ranges on my way to school each day.  
 At school sometimes I hear guns       
 and tanks. On the range they have     
 tanks, helicopters and planes. If you 
 see a red flag flying it means they   
 are doing an exercise. It is dangerous
 on the range. If you find things on   
 the range they might be live          
 ammunition and could explode. When    
 bombs go off they shake the school    
 windows and sometimes keep awake in   
 the night. Sometimes you can see      
 flares. The tall masts are called     
 dipoles and are used to send radio    
 messages. The army call the messages  
 'signals'. The big guns use areas     
 called{artillery ranges.}The nearby   
 woods and trees give the soldiers     
 practice in jungle warfare.           
                                       
                                       </content>
