		<title>02ARABLE FARMING IN MID ESSEX</title>
		<content> Three brothers together own Fithlers, 
 Butt Hatch and Blows Farm and run them
 as one unit of 500 acres.The large    
 farm house is a fine Victorian build- 
 ing. Although once mixed farms,they   
 are completely arable now,though the  
 old dairy and cow house are still     
 there. Crops give good profits, espe- 
 cially with subsidies.                
 They employ 2 men full-time,one bro-  
 ther can't work any more as he is     
 blind. They usually work an 8 hour day
 but at busy times much more.A favour- 
 ite job is cutting wheat.Barley"goes  
 down" in stormy weather.They can cut  
 80-100 tons a day.They depend on the  
 weather being favourable.Fields can't 
 be worked if they are wet.{MACHINERY  
 is expensive,a tractor,giving 10      
 years service cost Â£14,500 in 1983.It 
 will only be used for deep ploughing  
 for 2-3 years A combine costs Â£45,000.</content>
