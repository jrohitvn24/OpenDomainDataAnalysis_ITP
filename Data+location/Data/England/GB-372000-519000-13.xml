		<title>13ST JOHN THE BAPTIST CHURCH</title>
		<content>     The church of St.John the Baptist,
 Murton-cum-Hilton was built in 1856.  
 Of particular interest is the         
 three-decker pulpit and some fine oil 
 lamps.                                
    St John's is the one place of      
 religious worship, attached to the    
 parish of St.Lawrence's, Appleby      
 (Church of England), and sharing the  
 same vicar.  Roman Catholics and      
 Methodists must travel to Appleby for 
 regular church services.              
    The church here has a flourishing  
 Sunday School.                        
    Like most places of worship the    
 upkeep is a financial headache, and in
 1984 the parishioners had a most      
 successful Flower Festival to raise   
 extra funds.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
