 ART AND CRAFT.                        
                                       
 THERE WERE NO AMENITIES IN THIS AREA  
 FOR REGULAR DISPLAY. THERE WERE LOCAL 
 SHOWS FROM TIME TO TIME.MOST PEOPLE   
 HAD SOME SORT OF HOBBY,WHICH WAS      
 USUALLY A SPORT OR CRAFT:THE MOST     
 COMMON CRAFTS WERE KNITTING AND       
 SEWING.                               
 ONE LADY,HOWEVER,DID SPINNING AND     
 WEAVING.SHE HAS BEEN RETIRED 15 YEARS 
 THOUGH SHE USED TO BE AN ACCOUNTANT.  
 A GENTLEMAN,WHO WAS ALSO AN ACCOUNTANT
 BEFORE RETIREMENT,MADE WOODEN MODELS  
 OF GALLEONS.                          
 ANOTHER GENTLEMAN INVITED US INTO HIS 
 ANCIENT BARN TO SEE HIS WOOD-CARVINGS.
 THERE WERE SEVEN BEAUTIFUL OWLS,ALL   
 HAND-MADE,AND OTHER ANIMALS TOO.OUT   
 SIDE THE BARN WAS A MODEL GIPSY       
 CARAVAN,ABOUT HALF A METRE HIGH.      </content>
