 The area is predominantly agricultural
 76% of the land being used for crops  
 or grazing. The main crop in the early
 part of the year is potatoes the      
 second crop is usually cauliflowers or
 cabbages. A few fields are reserved   
 for the growing of daffodils both     
 flowers and bulbs. The grassland is   
 used entirely as feed for Jersey cows,
 the only breed allowed on the island, 
 either as pasture or for hay as winter
 feed.Only 15% of the area is used for 
 residential, recreational or community
 purposes. The remainder is either     
 woodland or inland water.             
 Being a farming area there is not     
 sufficient work for the local         
 population, therefore many travel to  
 work in St. Helier or to the airport  
 which is nearby.
