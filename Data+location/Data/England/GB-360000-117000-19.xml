		<title>19NW.SHERBORNE:A CONTROVERSY</title>
		<content> A subject that has aroused much{local 
{discussion}is the L.E.A.'s            
 recommendation to close Sherborne's   
 two, single sex{grammar schools.}The  
 reason given for this recommendation  
 is that{falling numbers}on roll make  
 it impossible to staff these schools  
 adequately: the numbers of secondary  
 age children in the area are likely to
 continue to fall for some while.      
 A{working party}had been set up to    
 look into possible alternatives, it   
 held{public meetings}in the town and  
 the surrounding villages to hear the  
 views of the inhabitants. The working 
 party's{report}to the County Council  
 was later published. Heated debate    
 continued in the{local paper,}the two 
 schools (Lord Digby's School and      
 Fosters School) being highly thought  
 of. The matter is now before the      
 Secretary of State for Education.     </content>
