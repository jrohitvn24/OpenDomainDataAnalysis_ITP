		<title>02TYDD ST. GILES-PARISH CHURCH</title>
		<content> The church was built about 800 years  
 ago.It is dedicated to St.Giles who is
 the patron saint of beggars and       
 cripples.The church was built of      
 Barnack Rag which came from the Manor 
 of Barnack in Huntingdon.It was       
 brought along the Shire Drain in      
 barges,and then taken to the site of  
 the church in carts.At first the      
 church was built with the tower built 
 on but for various reasons it was     
 taken down and was erected 50ft.      
 away.The church has Norman pillars    
 inside.It has Saxon sundials on the   
 south wall.The great west window      
 (which is constantly in need of       
 repair) was designed by Alan  de      
 Walsingham who also designed the      
 Lantern at Ely Cathedral.During one of
 the gales about 200 years ago the     
 chancel was blown down.
