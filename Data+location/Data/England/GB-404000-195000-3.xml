		<title>03THE PEOPLE AND THE COMMUNITY</title>
		<content>  Many of the people interviewed had   
 moved into South Cerney recently: in a
 few cases to work there, but many     
 because it is within easy reach of    
 Cirencester and Swindon. Most had come
 from other parts of the County, though
 some, who had moved in connection with
 their work, had come from the North of
 England. No_ one had parents who had  
 lived in the village before them, but 
 some had parents who had joined them, 
 to live there. The majority of the    
 inhabitants questioned had lived there
 for between 7 and 15 years.           
  People's reactions to the community  
 are very positive - they find it a    
 friendly, but quiet place with good   
 shops and lovely surrounding country_ 
 side. Suggestions for future develop_ 
 ment included better facilities for   
 leisure and public transport, for the 
 elderly and for shopping.             </content>
