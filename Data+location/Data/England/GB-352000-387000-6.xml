		<content>  We wondered how Bold in Widnes got   
 its name so we decided to find out. It
 seems that many years ago a village   
 was troubled by a mythical creature   
 called the griffin.Eventually the     
 villagers decided to offer a reward to
 anybody who could capture and kill the
 griffin.Quite soon  a young blacksmith
 offered to try and kill the griffin.  
 He built a strong cage and got in well
 armed. After a while the griffin came 
 and attacked the cage, after a long   
 struggle the griffin was injured and  
 killed.The villagers were pleased and 
 offered him some land as a reward.    
 They tried to think of a name for     
 this land, so because the blacksmith  
 was known to be bold, they named the  
 land BOLD.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
