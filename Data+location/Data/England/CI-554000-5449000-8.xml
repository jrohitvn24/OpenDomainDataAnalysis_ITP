		<title>08Les Quennevais School</title>
		<content>   Les Quennevais School and Community 
 centre was built in 1965. It serves   
 the western area of the island as a   
 school for 11 to 16 yr olds, and as a 
 centre providing facilities for adult 
 education and leisure activities.     
 Included in the campus is a library   
 used by both the school and the       
 community.                            
                                       
   The school is located at the edge of
 the estates which have been built in  
 post Second World War years between   
 Red Houses and the sea.  Immediately  
 to its north it is bounded by the     
 Railway Walk, the site of the old     
 Jersey Western railway line.  Beyond  
 the walk lie the sports fields and the
 open sand dunes.
