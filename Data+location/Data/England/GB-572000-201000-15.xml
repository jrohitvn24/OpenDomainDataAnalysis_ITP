		<title>15MUSHROOM FARM (CONT)</title>
		<content> A fork-lift truck carryiny four crates
 at a time is used to move the crates  
 about.The mushrooms take from three to
 six weeks to grow and they are cropped
 about three to four times.We went into
 one room where the mushrooms were just
 starting to grow.We could see the     
 heads just peeping out of the         
 earth.They were the size of pin heads.
 In another room the mushrooms were the
 size of dinner plates.The mushrooms   
 are picked by hand every day and the  
 stalks are thrown away as it is not   
 economical to sell them.The mushrooms 
 are sold to Spitalfields Market,      
 wholesalers and Tesco's.
