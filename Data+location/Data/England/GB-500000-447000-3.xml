		<title>03Beswick: People and Farming</title>
		<content> Much of the land in this area is owned
 by the Lord Hotham, and managed by    
 Hotham Estates. Many of the farmers   
 are tenant farmers, their houses and  
 farms, and associated farm-workers'   
 cottages, belonging to the Hotham     
 Estates.                              
 The three main farms in and around    
 Beswick are managed by the Beachell,  
 Duggleby and Spence families. Up to   
 relatively recent times these farms   
 would have provided employment for a  
 substantial number of workers but with
 the availability of modern machinery  
 very few men are required in addition 
 to the farmer himself.In August 1985  
 61 men, women and children were living
 in Beswick, including 3 generations of
 two families. Of the total population 
 less than one-third belongs to        
 families involved in farming.
