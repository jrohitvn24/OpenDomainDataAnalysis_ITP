		<title>20FUTURE FOR THE AIRPORT AREA</title>
		<content>    In the current economic climate,   
 none of the industrial or agricultural
 uses of the land are in decline. The  
 airport hopes to{expand},the chemical 
 works has been able to{adapt}to a new 
 form of transport whilst the farmers  
 are{benefitting}from EEC subsidies.   
    West Cleveland is becoming a more  
 popular place to live, with many new  
 housing developments. At the present  
 time, our survey block has not seen   
 any of this development, but it could 
 become the major{pressure on the land 
 in the future.
