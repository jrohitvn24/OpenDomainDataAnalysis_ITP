		<title>13WHERE WE LIVE 1</title>
		<content> I live in the London Borough of Newham
 which is on the east side of London   
 and north of the river Thames. The    
 name of my road is Alnwick Road and my
 home is a three bedroomed terraced    
 house built five years ago. This house
 is one of many in a large housing     
 estate. Nearby is Albert Dock         
 Hospital, once used for treating      
 dockers who worked in the docks       
 opposite. Now the hospital is a centre
 for handicapped people. The docks,    
 once busy with ships, are now closed. 
 On the south side of Alnwick Road at  
 the junction of Prince Regent's Lane  
 there is the Galleon Club which is the
 only building on that side of the     
 road. In Baxter Road at junction of   
 the Prince of Wales Road is the       
 Ascension Church of England Church. It
 has a hall which is used for dance    
 classes.                              </content>
