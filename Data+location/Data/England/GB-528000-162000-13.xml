		<title>13Croydon Airport</title>
		<content>The runways are now grassland and open 
space. They are used for flying model  
aeroplanes and kites and bicycle       
riding. The old airport buildings and  
the control tower are now used as      
office blocks and are hidden behind    
newly built factories and a petrol     
station. Two schools and  Roundshaw    
Estate have been built using the old   
airport as their play area. All that is
to remind us of the old airport is a   
small bit of concrete by St.Elpheges   
School and ditches  where trenches     
were built and where small roads had   
crossed the airfield. This used to be  
an exciting place but nowadays it is   
just a normal residential area.
