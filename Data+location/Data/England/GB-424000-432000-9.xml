		<title>09ARMLEY TOWN STREET- W.LEEDS</title>
		<content>    Armley Town Street is the main     
 shopping area in Armley. Situated two 
 miles from the centre of Leeds it     
 serves the local community. The street
 is nearly a mile in length. There is  
 along or near it almost every amenity 
 the people of Armley need-shops, pubs,
 clubs, swimming baths, a sport centre,
 library, clinic, banks and building   
 societies. Halfway along the street is
 Armley Moor, where Armley Feast (Fair)
 is held alternate years. The street is
 a busy, lively place during shopping  
 hours. Crowded with people and traffic
 it is a meeting place for the people  
 of Armley. Many shop there daily and  
 live within walking distance. Others  
 come by car or bus. It is easy for    
 those living in Armley to do all their
 shopping in Armley Town Street and    
 never go to the shops in nearby Leeds.
