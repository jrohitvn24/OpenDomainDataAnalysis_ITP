		<content> When the school was first built in    
 1870 it was only for boys who had to  
 pay a penny a week for lessons.There  
 were only 2 or 3 teachers. In the log 
 book it says a boy had severe beating 
 for dropping a live mouse in to the   
 stove.A large bell hangs outside,but  
 it is no longer used as its considered
 unsafe.The school has been added to   
 overthe years,and now has about  260  
 pupils from 5 to 12 years.            
 As well as the usual classrooms there 
 is a music room, woodwork and pottery 
 room and cloakrooms with showers.There
 are 2 playgrounds,a pond and a large  
 open area with a special part allowed 
 to go wild.                           
 The older children can cross the road 
 to Barn Meadow after lunch to play,for
 games.                                
 The children go to St Mary's church in
 the town for their carol service.     </content>
