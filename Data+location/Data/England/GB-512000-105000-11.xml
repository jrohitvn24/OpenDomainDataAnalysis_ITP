		<title>11SWANDEAN HOSPITAL</title>
		<content> The Present:early in 1985,Swandean    
 Hospital was threatened with closure, 
 because of the cutbacks affecting the 
 National Health Service.A publicity   
 campaign was mounted by the Friends of
 Swandean Hospital,and later in the    
 year the threat of closure was lifted.
 The hospital is 3.2 ha.2 in area and  
 plays a vital role for the long term  
 elderly sick and the young chronic    
 sick.                                 
 Swandean Hospital has 110 staff,a     
 swimming pool and a staff recreation  
 building.                             
 The Future:Swandean Hospital is       
 hoping to extend its buildings,at a   
 cost of Â£150,000.It will be completed 
 in the year 2000.They will extend the 
 Young chronic sick and the Elderly    
 departments so they can have more beds
 in each.
