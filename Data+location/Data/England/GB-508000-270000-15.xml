		<title>15TRANSPORT IN WEST CAMBS.</title>
		<content>    The main form of transport is the  
 private car, with most families owning
 at least one vehicle.                 
    The privately-operated 'Stagecoach'
 caters mainly for the young and       
 elderly, providing a morning bus to   
 Huntingdon for pre-booked passengers, 
 with return journeys at 4.3O and 5.3O 
 p.m., for pupils and workers.   Extra 
 buses, allowing time for a few hours  
 in Huntingdon, operate on Thursday and
 Saturday, market day. On Wednesday the
 Stagecoach takes passengers to        
 Bedford, Peterborough, Northampton or 
 Kettering, with a different           
 destination each week.                
    By adapting its route to meet the  
 needs of travellers, the Stagecoach   
 provides a valuable service to the    
 elderly, who can even arrange for the 
 driver to collect medicines from the  
 Kimbolton surgery on their behalf.    </content>
