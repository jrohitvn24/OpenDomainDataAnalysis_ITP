		<content>{St. Giles Church, Mountnessing        
   This is the one historic building in
 the area. The church was built in     
{1150.}The west front exterior is of   
 pleasant mellowed red brick with large
 S clamps bolted through the wall to   
 the belfry timbers. Round pillars,    
 built by the{Normans,}support the     
 heavy oak beams and the roof. It has a
 stubby octagonal spire.               
   Interesting artifacts in the church 
 include a{13th century}oak chest, hewn
 out of a solid tree, a stone carving  
 of a woman with a bridle in her mouth 
 and a large fossilised bone_whalebone 
 or wild elephant?                     
   At one time{St. Giles Church}may    
 have served a larger population but   
 now it is used only for a weekly      
 celebration of the Holy Eucharist at  
 11.15am on Sundays and for other      
 occasional services.                  </content>
