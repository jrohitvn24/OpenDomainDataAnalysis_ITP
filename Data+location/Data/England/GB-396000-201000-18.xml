		<content>     THE PROSPECT OF{NEW HOUSES}HAS    
 MET  WITH A {MIXED RESPONSE.}         
                                       
    THOSE LIVING OPPOSITE THE  PLANNED 
 DEVELOPMENT  ARE  NOT  PLEASED AT THE 
 THOUGHT OF{HOUSES BEING  BUILT  CLOSE 
 TO  THEIR  OWN, ESPECIALLY AS SEVERAL 
 HAVE JUST PURCHASED THE COUNCIL HOUSE 
 IN  WHICH  THEY  HAVE  LIVED FOR MANY 
 YEARS. AT  THE SAME  TIME IT IS HOPED 
 THAT {NEW  FAMILIES  WOULD  MEAN MORE 
{CHILDREN} SO  THAT THE{VILLAGE SCHOOL 
{WOULD BE SAFE FROM CLOSURE}HAVING ONLY
 FIFTEEN CHILDREN ON ROLL AT PRESENT.  
                                       
                                       
     THE EMPTY HOUSES ARE IN NEED OF   
 REPAIR AND MODERNISATION.THE UNTENDED 
 LARGE GARDENS ARE OVERGROWN AND NEED  
 ATTENTION.
