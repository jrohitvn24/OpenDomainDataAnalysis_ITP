		<title>04Old Down Inn, Emborough</title>
		<content> 1740AD is carved into the wall of The 
 Old Down Inn situated on the Wells to 
 Bath road at its junction with the    
 A37.  It is a reminder of its status  
 in the stage coach ara when it was    
 very important to the Royal Mail,     
 being first a posting house and later 
 a Receiving Office.  The stables      
 remain behind the Inn, and although   
 having been totally rebuilt after     
 being gutted by fire in 1885, still   
 has the same exterior as in the       
 eighteenth century.  The Inn is no    
 longe so prominent since the path of  
 the A3139 was slightly deviated to    
 make the junction safer but it still  
 maintains old traditions and offers   
 meals, snacks and overnight,          
 accomodation to the motorists who have
 replaced the mailcoach passengers.
