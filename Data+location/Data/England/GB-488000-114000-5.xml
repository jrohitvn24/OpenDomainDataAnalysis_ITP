		<title>05BIRDS OF THE S. DOWNS</title>
		<content>    The birds habitat has suffered from
 ploughing &amp; clearing.                 
    Game birds regularly seen &amp;        
 plentiful are pheasants, which are    
 bred by landowners.  Partridge are    
 scarce in 1985 but the cold spring    
 this year could explain this.         
    The most common birds of prey are  
 Kestrel &amp; Sparrow-hawk.  Rooks &amp;      
 Lapwings join the flocks of           
 Black-Headed Gulls that follow the    
 plough to feast on the insects in the 
 newly turned soil.                    
    By far the most numerous of the    
 small birds is the lark, which nests  
 on the ground &amp; soars high above the  
 edge of the Downs.  Siskins &amp;         
 Goldcrests appear to like the conifers
 &amp; may be seen flitting in &amp; out among 
 the branches.  Woodpigeons are        
 numerous, but cuckoos are now much    
 less common.                          </content>
