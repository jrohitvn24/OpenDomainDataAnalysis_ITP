		<title>04    Grove Park</title>
		<content>{  Grove park}used to be part of the   
 private gardens that belonged to the  
 Smyth-Pigott family; a very           
 influential Weston family.In 1889 the 
 family decided to lease the land to   
 the town.Therefore the gardens were   
 opened to the public and Grove Park   
 opened on{20th June 1891.             
   Grove house was an important part of
 the park, but it was bombed and       
 mainly destroyed during the           
 war.All that is left now are the      
 gateways which used to be part  of the
 coach house.                          
   Today Grove Park is a very popular  
 place; with both holiday makers and   
 Westoners.There are rockeries,        
 waterfalls, a tennis court and a      
 bandstand.Around the pond are the     
 remains of statues which were bought  
 by John Hugh Smyth-Pigott at the sale 
 of Strawberry Hill.                   </content>
