		<content> From our information of Bulkington    
 most people thought it was litter     
 free, but a small and friendly place  
 to shop.  They said there ought to    
 be more entertainment for children.   
 There are more farms than there should
 be. The biggest shop is the CO_OP     
 where most people shop, if not they   
 shop at Bedworth, Coventry or         
 Nuneaton.                             
  Most people have a car for transport 
 and think Bulkington is a pleasant    
 place to live in.                     
 Most people in Bulkington worry about 
 money and jobs. Altogether most people
 liked  Bulkington. Most people lived  
 in either semi_detached or a bungalow.
  There is not much they would like to 
 change in Bulkington except for the   
 lack of entertainment.
