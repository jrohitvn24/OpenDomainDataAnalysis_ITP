		<content> On Wednesday morning I got up at      
 8 o' clock in the morning. I got up   
 and had my breakfast, and after it,   
 I went to the bathroom,and had a wash 
 then  I got my swimming kit ready.Then
 did my hair then I did my teeth and   
 got my coat and I put my stuff In my  
 bag.And put my shoes  on then went to 
 call for Nicola and Sarah.            
                                       
 When we got to school we had to wait  
 for the whistle to go. When it had    
 gone we  all lined up to go into      
 school. When we got in I hung up my   
 coat and bags. We cleaned out the     
 guinea-pigs.Then I went to Mrs        
 Pleasants group. Where we talked      
 about area in maths.
