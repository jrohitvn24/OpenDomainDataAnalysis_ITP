		<title>13Mr Philips The Garage Owner</title>
		<content> Mr Philips has owned the garage for   
 sixteen months, before that he lived  
 in Lea for seventeen years and earlier
 Bardney for eleven years.             
  He has worked in a garage for        
 twenty-three years and prior to this  
 as a policeman.                       
  This is a family business, which has 
 a lot of customers every day and      
 therefore, Mr Philips does not want to
 change his business in any way.       
  His working day he describes has     
 hectic. Some days it is all paper work
 from morning to night and other days, 
 he works in the garage doing repairs  
 and Minstry of Transport tests.       
  He has not much time for leisure as  
 he works thirteen hour a day, seven   
 days a week. He employs six people two
 of which are his sons.
