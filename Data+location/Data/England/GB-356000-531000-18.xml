		<title>18Employment:</title>
		<content> Most people in this area who need work
 have the opportunity to be employed   
 locally.Many people interested in     
 agriculture,can work close to home,   
 either on their own farm,or on a near-
 by farm.Monkhouse's farm feed mill is 
 probably the biggest employer in the  
 village.It used to be a privately     
 owned firm with the majority of employ
 ees being local.They used to build and
 buy houses in the village for workers.
 Some of these people had the opport-  
 unity of buying their homes when a    
 national company bought the mill.Birds
 is a locally owned poultry packing    
 factory and frozen food shop. It      
 processes locally reared poultry and  
 employs workers from nearby villages. 
 Hendersons own several wagons and     
 employ local drivers for long distance
 haulage.The boardmill in the next     
 village employs shift workers.        </content>
