		<title>05THE GRAND SHAFT</title>
		<content> so that no unauthorised personnel     
 could use a particular stairway unless
 they had the right card to do so.     
                                       
  The shaft was designed by Sir Thomas 
 Hyde-Page in 1802 and took five years 
 to complete.                          
                                       
 The shaft was manned by two soldiers, 
 usually Military Police,one at the top
 and the other at the bottom.There was 
 also another soldier with them who    
 checked the passes to make sure that  
 the soldiers who were returning were  
 not late.
