		<title>02 THE VILLAGES.</title>
		<content>Denton has several old cottage         
properties around a triangular village 
green at its centre.Most of the        
cottages were originally built for     
employees of Castle Ashby estate but   
many are now privately owned. Three of 
these cottages are thatched with       
Norfolk reeds.In the village as a whole
there are now only 5 thatched houses   
but older residents can remember as    
many as 24.                            
Two large estates have more than       
doubled the population of Denton in the
last 20 years.                         
Hackleton does not have a central point
but consists of serveral old stone     
houses (some quite large) built either 
side of the main road through the      
village. The new estates have developed
behind these houses.A small number of  
houses are being erected in both places
at the present time.                   </content>
