		<content> There are many animals and plants in a
 nature area called{Castle Eden Walkway
 The Walkway used to be an old railway 
 and the station house is now a Field  
 Centre.The{ecology}of this Walkway    
 area is affected by the fact that it  
 was once a{railway.}Steep embankments,
 non-indigenous plant seed dispersal   
 and carbon deposits from steam trains 
 have all helped to produce a peculiar 
 environment to study.There are three  
 environments at Castle Eden Walkway-  
 1.The Walkway itself 2.The woods where
 badgers live and 3.A pond where water 
 life is abundant.In addition the woods
 provide a refuge for many species of  
 birds and heavy undergrowth on the    
 sides of embankments create breeding  
 grounds for butterflies.              
 The open farmland also provides       
 suitable conditions for rabbits and   
 hares and kestrels have been spotted. </content>
