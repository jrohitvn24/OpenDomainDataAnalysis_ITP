 The main village in our area,Bodle    
 Street Green,is listed in the County  
 Structure Plan as a village which can 
 have no new houses unless replacements
 or infilling.So most of the houses are
 old-the bigger grander are yoeman farm
 houses of the 17 and 18 century,and   
 the smaller ones are 18 or 19 century 
 artisan's cottages-all endlessly      
 extended over the years with porches, 
 rooms and whole new wings.About six   
 new dwellings have been built in the  
 last 25 years. As a result,Bodle      
 Street has become a very desirable    
 area,and property is expensive.Yet    
 despite the prices a most obvious     
 change has taken place in the last few
 years-the houses are being bought by  
 young couples with families and not by
 the newly retireds who have been      
 coming here for so long.              </content>
