		<title>15A SCHOOL DAY IN HECKMONDWIKE</title>
		<content> I  get  up at  seven  o'clock  in  the
 morning and usually have cereal for my
 breakfast.  I  set  off  for school at
 twenty  past  eight.  I arrive  at the
 Grammar  School  at twenty to  nine in
 time for the  bell at  ten to nine. We
 have four  lessons in the  morning and
 three   in  the   afternoon.   Typical
 lessons are Maths, English  and French
 which  we have nearly every day. Other
 lessons   are    Geography,   Physics,
 History,  Chemistry,  Craft and R.E. I
 take  sandwiches for my dinner and eat
 them in the school hall. I set off for
 home  at half  past three and I arrive
 at  ten to  four.  My  homework  takes
 about an hour. I then watch television
 programmes like 'Dallas', 'Blue Peter'
 'Dynasty' and  'Coronation  Street'. I
 go to bed at nine o'clock.
