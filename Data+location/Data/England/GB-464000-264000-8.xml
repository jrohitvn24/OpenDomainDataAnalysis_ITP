		<title>08NATIONAL TRUST HEADQUARTERS</title>
		<content>   The regional headquarters of the    
National Trust for the South-East of   
England are at Scotney Castle.         
   The National Trust started in 1895  
to look after old houses and beautiful 
countryside.                           
   Mr. Kingston is the regional        
director. Mr. Evans is one of the two  
accountants. There is also a Land      
Agent, an Architect, an Artist, an     
Antiques Advisor a Publicity Officer   
and several Secretaries.               
   The offices are in a converted barn 
where wagons were stored. There is a   
lot of equipment, including a computer.
   People come from all over the world 
to help the National Trust. They stay  
at Acorn Camp, an old house in the     
woods. Working with the wardens they   
make up footpath signs and clear parts 
of the woods.
