		<content> An area of Outstanding Natural Beauty 
 (AONB) &amp; is wholly agricultural,      
 mainly arable &amp; sheep country with    
 some dairy &amp; stock raising.           
 Fortunately coppicing is still        
 practiced (15-20 yr intervals) mainly 
 chestnut but some hazel &amp; ash for     
 fencing &amp; firewood. After coppicing   
 the bluebells &amp; foxgloves return &amp;    
 butterflies &amp; birds are encouraged by 
 the new growth. There are very many   
 badgers. There are about 250-300      
 people in the block, apart form       
 Hastingleigh (about 150) living       
 scattered small groups of houses &amp;    
 farms. It is a close, friendly &amp;      
 caring community, no home help has    
 ever been needed, the community "mucks
 in". The village hall is well used by 
 various organisations.
