		<title>15A Newcomer's View.</title>
		<content>      Emma's Mum gave us a newcomer's  
 view of the village.  They moved to   
 West Ashton 8yrs ago. They wanted an  
 "Out of Town" place to live when her  
 husband's employment moved to Bath,   
 and West Ashton "felt right". They    
 live in one of the new houses just in-
 side our block. They settled in easily
 as the "locals" made them very welcome
 However they find it harder to mix    
 with other newcomers who tend to      
 isolate themselves. " There is the    
 feeling of two separate communuties in
 the village, also a general reluctance
 for community involvement."           
      The family enjoys the close prox-
 imity of the countryside, especially  
 the bonus of abundant wildlife that   
 visits the garden. Mrs.T's hobby is   
 gardening and she has a part time job 
 taking aerobics classes in Trowbridge 
 and Frome.                            </content>
