		<title>07Nauls Mill Park: Coventry</title>
		<content> Nauls Mills Park is the Coundon area  
 of Coventry.It has also been called   
 Hill Mill,Wragg's Mill,Abbott's Mill  
 and Carters Mill.It is now named after
 the last owner who was called Naul.It 
 was originally used for               
 "fulling"(cleaning and thickening     
 cloth).The Mill was built where       
 Radford Brook crossed Abbotts Lane and
 was first recorded in the 11th        
 Century.After the dissolution of the  
 Monasteries the owners,Bartholemew and
 Thomas gave it to the                 
 Corporation in order to pay for a     
 schoolmaster at Coventry Grammar      
 School.In 1869 the Mill was owned by a
 silk "throwster"(a person who twists  
 silk into thread).In 1889 the Mill was
 landscaped to provide a park for the  
 local residents.The Mill pond was kept
 and is used to sail model boats.
