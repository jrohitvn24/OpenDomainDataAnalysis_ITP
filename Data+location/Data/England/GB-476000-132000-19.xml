		<content> The soil of that part of Blackmoor    
 Estate that lies within our D-block   
 falls into three categories.          
 (a)  Upper Green Sand. This is found  
 along the hill ridge that runs north  
 -south down the western side of the   
 block. It is very fertile and is used 
 for the production of apples, pears   
 and hops.  Hops are being phased out  
 due to the dropping demand for beer,  
 and rising production costs.          
 (b)  Heavy, or Gault Clay. This runs  
 eastwards from the ridge. The land is 
 only 150 feet above sea level. It is  
 very wet, and needs much drainage. It 
 is used for growing cerials, mostly   
 wheat, and for grass for dairy cattle.
 (c)  Lower Green Sand. This lies in   
 the vicinity of Blackmmoor Village,   
 and covers the remainder of the block.
 The part within the Estate is used    
 for growing orchard nursery stock.    </content>
