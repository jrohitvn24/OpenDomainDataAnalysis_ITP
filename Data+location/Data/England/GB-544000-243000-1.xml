		<title>01The Area West of Duxford</title>
		<content> This area marks the edge of the chalk 
 belt running from Baldock to          
 Newmarket, and is gently undulating.  
 Land is used for crops - mainly       
 cereals or sugar beet - with some     
 areas of grassland for hay or silage. 
 The M11, northwards from Stumps Cross 
 to the A45 Cambridge Northern Bypass, 
 provides rapid north-south access.    
 Industry in the nearby village of     
 Duxford is science-based (Ciba-Geigy, 
 and Techne) and recently Volvo BM UK  
 Ltd has set up its UK headquarters.   
 The Imperial War Museum houses its    
 reserve collection in the hangers of  
 the former RAF Duxford aerodrome and  
 the 'superhanger' houses the larger   
 civil and military aircraft; flying   
 displays are given during the summer  
 and local people join other volunteers
 in restoring and maintaining vintage  
 and veteran non-flying aircraft.      </content>
