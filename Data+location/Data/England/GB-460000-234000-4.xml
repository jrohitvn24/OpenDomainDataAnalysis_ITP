		<content> In 1931 virtually everyone in the area
 was employed either directly in the   
 Manor or in agriculture on its        
 farms.The same was true for the       
 outlying areas of this block which    
 reach almost to Turweston, Biddlesden,
 Shalstone and Mixbury,villages similar
 to Westbury. Today only a few workers 
 are needed on the modern arable farms 
 but in Westbury at least the manor    
 still forms a focus for employment as 
 it is now a private school with 15    
 teachers and at least the same number 
 of ancilliary workers most of whom    
 live in the village.Recently          
 1ntroduced jobs include a small car   
 components firm,an adhesive and       
 plastics factory and a retail outlet  
 occupying rooms in the old mill. The  
 remaining workers travel to the nearby
 towns of Brackley and Buckingham or   
 even as far as London.                </content>
