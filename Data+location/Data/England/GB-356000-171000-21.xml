it's interesting hearing about Hypermarkets in the original article, knowing what a focal point ASDA's is now and not having lived here for long (18 months) I can't say whether ASDA has changed the character of the area for better or worse. But East Street itself is now a bus lane, so much more pedestrian friendly. And it seems the shopping down there is still pretty vibrant, with lots of independent stores and a good mix of people. I couldn't comment on parking as I'm a cyclist :)   &lt;br />
