 built of local stone is about{half a  
{mile from the village}of Lytchett     
 Matravers. There are 3 ancient yews in
 the old churchyard and it is surounded
 by an ancient stone wall. A new car   
 park has been laid out under the wall 
 to the north whilst to the south      
 stretches the burial ground used      
 today.                                
    The services are well attended on  
 Sundays and weekdays, and the church  
 is used for{baptisms, marriages and   
{funerals.}The rector is a young man of
 34, and his wife is a deaconess and   
 they have two small daughters.        
    The church, as ever, is looking for
 funds for maintenance. It's{most      
{valuable possesion}is the{silver      
{goblet and plate}dated 1574.          
    Once a month united services are   
 held with the Methodist congregation. </content>
