		<content> There are no schools in this area and 
 no playschools.Pre-school children at-
 tend the play-group run by mothers in 
 the neighbouring village of Kirkby.   
 Children of primary school age travel 
 by bus to the nearest school which is 
 in Osgodby.These children take packed 
 lunches as no hot meals are available.
 From the age of 11 most children go to
 the comprehensive school about 7 miles
 away at Market Rasen.This school off- 
 ers CSE &amp; O &amp; A level GCE courses and 
 many extra-curricular activities.     
 If parents so wish their children may 
 sit a selection exam and if successful
 attend the grammar school at Caistor  
 which is about 8 mls away. Normally   
 parents are responsible for providing 
 transport for children to Caistor.    
 Various evening classes for adults are
 arranged in nearby villages and towns.
