		<title>01BRADNOP AND ITS SURROUNDINGS</title>
		<content>     Bradnop is a small village, near  
Leek, bordering onto the Staffordshire 
Moorlands.  The village forms the focus
of a predominantly rural study area.   
Apart from the cluster of about twenty 
buildings in the village the only other
settlements consist of dispersed       
farmsteads.                            
     The land-use of the area is       
dominated by farmland with most being  
either for grazing or silage.  The     
relief of the area is varied: to the   
south of Bradnop the land is flat      
whereas as one travels north the land  
rises sharply to form a ridge running  
in an east-west direction.             
     Communications in the area are    
poor with only the A523 (Ashbourne Rd.)
and a few minor roads to be found.     
After a period of decline Bradnop has  
experienced recent building development
in terms of some private houses.       </content>
