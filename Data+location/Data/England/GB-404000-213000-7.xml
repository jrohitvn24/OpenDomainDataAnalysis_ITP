		<title>07YANWORTH - LACK OF AMENITIES</title>
		<content>     Many  rural  areas  blame "retired
 city types", "weekenders" and affluent
 two car commuters for losing services.
 This hardly applies in this particular
 area  and {Yanworth never had  or  can
{barely remember some basic amenities. 
     The{village school}finally  closed
 in 1945 after evacuee children gave it
 a temporary  reprieve  in 1940.    Now
 primary  children  have  to  travel to
 Chedworth or Northleach, both 4.5 kms.
 and  secondary  children to Northleach
 or  Bourton-on-the-Water about 14 kms.
     The {nearest  railway station }was
 Foss Cross,  about 6.5 kms.,  and that
 offered a slow infrequent service.    
     A{daily bus service}never existed,
 a {weekly service}to Cheltenham closed
 in  the  mid 1960's  and {now  only  a
{single Friday afternoon service allows
{mainly older people  from  surrounding
{villages to shop in Cirencester.      </content>
