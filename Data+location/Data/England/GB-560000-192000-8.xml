{Hogarth Primary,}recently amalgamated 
 from a separate infant and junior     
 school (the infant building is        
 currently used for youth training).   
 Despite local opposition,{Hutton      
{village C.P.}will close in July '85.

 large part of Hutton (roll 1100),     
 while other children go to a number of
 secondary schools just outside the    
 area.{Brentwood School}(Public) is    
 just outside the area, but most of the
 extensive playing fields and          
 Preparatory school are within.        
{ Shenfield Library}has  all the       
 usual facilities as well as providing 
 "extras" such as large print books. A 
 Talking Newspaper provides 150 weekly 
 cassetes, 300 monthly and 600         
 quarterly. A{Brentwood Advertiser}in  
 Braille is available.                 </content>
