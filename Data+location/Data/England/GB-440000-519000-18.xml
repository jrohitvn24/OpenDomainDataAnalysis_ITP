		<title>18STOCKTON -- OUR TOWN</title>
		<content> What I like about Stockton is that    
 there is plenty of nightlife and      
 plenty of supermarkets like Hintons,  
 Tesco, Asda. There is also a twice    
 weekly market along the length of the 
 High Street. There is the Green Dragon
 Yard Museum telling us about the      
 history of Stockton. We have a town   
 hall in the centre of the High Street 
 which has been rebuilt and is very    
 nice to look at. We have quite a few  
 pool clubs and amusement arcades. THe 
 things I dislike about Stockton are   
 that there are not enough disco's for 
 our age  and there is no ice-rink.    
 Also you can't go to the parks at     
 night time because of the 'joeys' and 
 'skinheads' fighting. At Christmas    
 time we have carol singers in the     
 town, carnivals, decorated buses,     
 coloured lights, brass bands and Santa
 Claus.         {Dawn Stephenson       </content>
