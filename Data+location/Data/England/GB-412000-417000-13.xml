		<title>13THORNHILL ESTATE HUDD'SFIELD</title>
		<content> The Thornhill Estate stretches from   
 Edgerton in Huddersfield, through     
 surrounding districts, finally        
 reaching Pudsey.  In Edgerton most of 
 the Estate was beginning to develop in
 the 1860's therefore most of the      
 properties are pre-Second World War.  
 However there have been many additions
 to the Estate especially from 1933,   
 when a limited company was established
 and much land was sold off on leases. 
 Cowcliffe and Fixby are extremely     
 residential areas and the majority of 
 houses are leasehold.  There is a     
 large unpopulated area next to the    
 vast Fixby Park housing development,  
 which is currently undersurveillance  
 by the Town Planning Association.     
 Today, in 1985 leases are still held  
 by the Thornhill Estate and an annual 
 ground rent of Â£2 per residental      
 property is charged for outgoings.    </content>
