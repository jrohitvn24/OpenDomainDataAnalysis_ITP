		<title>02COAL PRODUCTION</title>
		<content> Eighty per cent of the production of  
 coal from Creswell Colliery is taken  
 by the power stations situated on the 
 River Trent. It is used to generate   
 electricity which is fed into the     
 National Grid. The remainder of the   
 coal is sold as household fuel.       
 A train carrying 1,000 tonnes can be  
 loaded with coal in one hour, the 30  
 tonne wagons being filled four at a   
 time. Up to four of these             
 merry-go-round trains leave Creswell  
 each day, taking coal to the local    
 power stations.                       
 Most of the household coal is         
 transported by road.                  
 Methane gas is pumped out of the mine,
 mixed with air and used for firing a  
 boiler. The hot water is used for the 
 pit head baths and for heating the    
 offices.                              
                                       </content>
