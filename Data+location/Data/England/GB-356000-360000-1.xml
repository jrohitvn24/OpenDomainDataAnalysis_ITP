 and the{Church}lie on the south side  
 of the road, while{Tilstone Lodge}lies
 to the north.                         
  It lies in the{Cheshire Plain,}which 
 consists of rich grassland, ideal for 
{dairy farming.}                       
  Most of the land in this area is used
 in this way,the predominant herds of  
 cattle being{Friesians,}although some 
 farms do have other breeds as well.   
  There are very few houses,no shops or
 public houses in this area.
