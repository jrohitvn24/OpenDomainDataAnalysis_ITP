		<content>      Coal Aston is mentioned in the   
 Domesday Book as Estune. It has       
 remained until relatively recent times
 a small village 1km. north-east of    
 the small town of Dronfield.          
      Modern housing now joins the     
 village with Dronfield. Its village   
 school closed four years ago as the   
 children could easily attend the      
 newer and larger schools that were    
 built for the housing development. The
 old school building is now            
 converted into private dwellings.
