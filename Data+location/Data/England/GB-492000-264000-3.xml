		<title>03MY HOLIDAY IN GREAT YARMOUTH</title>

When we go on holiday we stay in a     
caravan by the sea.I enjoy it because  
there's so much to do.Early every morn-
ing I get my bike out and go for a ride
After breakfast we go to the beach and 
dad and I play cricket.When I get hot I
buy an ice-cream to cool me down,or I  
paddle in the sea.We go back to the    
caravan for lunch and we have cold     
drinks.In the afternoon there are fairs
to go to,and I can even go fishing.    
                                       
In the evening we have a barbecue which
I enjoy because I am very hungry.If the
weather is bad,I get my toy soldiers   
out and play with them.When the two    
weeks are over,we go home to Irchester 
and wait for the next holiday.
