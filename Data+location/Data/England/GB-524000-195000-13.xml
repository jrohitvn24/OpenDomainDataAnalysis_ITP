		<content>{HOUSING - THE NEW ESTATE}             
 DOLLIS VALLEY ESTATE IS A RATHER SMALL
 AREA BUT IS DENSELY POPULATED. IT CAN 
 HOUSE ABOUT 600 FAMILIES. THERE ARE   
 BLOCKS OF FLATS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE  
 ESTATE AND TERRACED HOUSES ROUND THE  
 EDGES. THE ESTATE WAS PUT UP ABOUT 17 
 YEARS AGO TO HELP THE HOUSING         
 SITUATION IN BARNET. THE REINFORCED   
 CONCRETE SECTIONS FROM WHICH THE HOMES
 ARE BUILT SEEMS TO HAVE CAUSED        
 PROBLEMS WITH CONDENSATION. THEY ARE  
 PUTTING TRADITIONAL SLOPING ROOFS OVER
 THE FLAT ONES BECAUSE WATER HAS LEAKED
 IN. THERE IS WASTELAND ON ONE SIDE AND
 A FEW SHOPS IN FRONT OF THE FLATS; THE
 SWEET SHOP ALSO ACTS AS A POST OFFICE.
 IT LOOKS VERY DULL AND BORING WITHOUT 
 COLOURS AND THERE IS LITTER BY THE    
 SHOPS. DURING THE DAY IT IS VERY QUIET
 BUT MUCH NOISIER WHEN THE SCHOOLS     
 CLOSE.                                </content>
