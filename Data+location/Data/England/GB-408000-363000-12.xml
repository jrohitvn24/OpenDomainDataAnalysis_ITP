		<title>12Microplant Factory, Longnor</title>
		<content>    The microplant factory was founded 
in June 1983 by A.P.Ranchoad and Martin
Stokes.  It was not the first factory  
of its kind in the U.K.  Cuttings are  
taken from adult plants and are put in 
an artificial mixture that feeds them. 
They are then kept in special storage  
containers heated to the exact         
temperature for four weeks.  Then they 
are transplanted into compost and put  
in a greenhouse until they reach a     
certain height.  They are then         
transplanted to nurseries all over the 
world.  The greenhouse is held by a    
frame and the sides are filled up with 
air to insulate it.  All the building  
is lit by electricity. If they have a  
power-cut they seal up the insulation  
tubes.  The workers have to take off   
their white overalls before going      
outside in case of contamination.
