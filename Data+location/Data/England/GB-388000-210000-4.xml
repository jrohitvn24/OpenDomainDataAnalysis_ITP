		<title>04CRANHAM FEAST</title>
		<content> Cranham Feast is a traditional event  
 in the Village.It is held every year  
 and it is held on a weekend.There are 
 lots of activities such as a Fair and 
 Sports. One of these is a Boundary    
 race,developed from the old custom of 
 beating the bounds thus marking the   
 village boundary. In earlier times the
 party would have been met by the Lord 
 of the Manor who would have given them
 a feast of bread and cheese and cider.
    Then there would have been games   
 until it grew dark when all went      
 home.Today the Feast is a deer        
 roast,supported by a fun-fair,a parade
 of hounds and a mime of the Lord of   
 the Manor being greeted by the        
 villagers and traditionally the       
 first venison roll is for the Lord    
 of the Manor.
