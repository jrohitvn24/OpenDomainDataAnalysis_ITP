		<title>19LADIES DAY, NESTON</title>
		<content> The Neston Friendly Society was formed
 in 1814 to help the poor and needy    
 women of Neston during the Napoleonic 
 War.It is an all female society apart 
 from the secretary who is male.It was 
 the first to be formed in Britain and 
 is now the only one left in this      
 country.On the first Thursday in June 
 a Ladies Day Walk is held.The society 
 which runs the procession is a self   
 help assurance organisation offering  
 death, sickness and maternity benefits
 in return for a small subscription of 
 around seven pence a month.The        
 procession is the club's annual       
 meeting.Ladies Day is a social        
 occasion.Arranged to coincide with the
 procession is the arrival of the fair 
 (an annual event).The children are    
 given free tickets for rides as a     
 thankyou for taking part in the       
 parade.        p.t.o.                 </content>
