		<content> On Wednesday my mum goes to Mann's in 
 Torquay which is a wholeseller. They  
 sell fruit and veg and she buys some  
 things from there and grows the rest  
 in our garden. In the afternoon she   
 packs the fruit and veg in the car. On
 Thursday morning she goes to Staverton
 market near Totnes and she sells it   
 there. Other people do the same thing,
 they grow flowers, vegetables and     
 fruit and sell them in the local      
 markets, particularly Newton Abbot. At
 Rocombe, Stokeinteignhead, Mr Maurice 
 Hunt grows anemones. He is now known  
 world wide. He dislikes using         
 insecticides and pays children to     
 collect ladybirds (5p each) for his   
 greenhouses. Trades surviving and     
 active include thatching, cider       
 making, building but there is no      
 longer a farrier or blacksmith.
