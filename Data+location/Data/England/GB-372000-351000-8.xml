 tea factories all over England.       
 The blending then takes place.It is   
 blended in a blending drum.Sometimes  
 thirty different kinds of tea are     
 blended to obtain a good blend of     
 strength flavour and colour.Tea       
 tasters are employed in this process. 
 The tea is put in a hopper and the    
 packets are filled and later sealed.  
 The tea leaves are chopped up smaller 
 and put into tea bags then they are   
 transported to shops.
