 The Radio Station at Highbridge is the
 biggest in the world.The proper name  
 of the station is {PORTISHEAD  RADIO  
{STATION}.The old part of the station  
 was built in 1927 and the wings were  
 added in 1940 &amp; 1970.In 1982 the new  
 station was completed.150 people are  
 employed there.The radio station is   
 capable of sending messages to ships  
 all round the world.The main way of   
 communicating is by telex,morse code &amp;
 voice.The Radio Station is also       
 connected with Somerton,Ongar,        
 Leafield &amp; Ruby Stations.It once had  
 33 aerials but now it's only got      
 one.This connects it to the other     
 stations by micro waves,so            
 communications are extremely rapid.
