 Many competitions and activities are  
 organised on an inter-house basis.    
 Rydon is well-equipped for all major  
 sports, including swimming and has    
 excellent facilities for Craft,       
 Science and Computing.  During 1984,  
 Rydon became a community school,with  
 its own community tutor. 88 different 
 courses are available with a youth    
 wing on site.  Future plans include   
 extending the range of courses and    
 increasing the facilities available to
 the local community.
