		<title>03INTERVIEW WITH MR. HOOKER</title>
		<content>   We went to see{Mr.Hooker.}He is an  
 elderly resident.He is eighty nine and
 has worked in the nursery for sixty to
 seventy years.He has two sons and one 
 daughter,they all work in the nursery.
   Mr. Hooker was born in Winchester   
 and married in Sparsholt.He has just  
 celebrated his{Diamond}wedding        
 anniversery.                          
   Mr.Hooker would never leave         
 Littleton.He likes reading and there  
 is a mobile library.He does not drink 
 or smoke(may be that is why he has    
 lived so long).He gets his food from  
 Littleton post  office but he gets    
 furniture ect. from Winchester.       
   There are now street lamps and there
 never have  been. Until the last two  
 years there have been no policemen.   
   Mr.Hooker does not mind Littleton   
 all though he can remember when       
{Flowerdown}was open downs and grass.  </content>
