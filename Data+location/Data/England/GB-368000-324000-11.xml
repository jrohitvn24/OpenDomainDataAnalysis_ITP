		<content>  The block cannot boast of            
 architecture in the grand English     
 tradition but it does have many       
 examples of fine vernacular styles.   
  There are still a few timber framed  
 houses to be seen with exposed        
 woodwork. Some buildings are made of  
 sandstone.                            
  Houses constructed in the last 300   
 years or so up until the First World  
 War were made of mellow brick laid    
 upon a foundation of large blocks of  
 old red sandstone.                    
  No thatched roofs were found in the  
 area, tile is the predominant roofing 
 material with slate being used on a   
 few roofs.
