		<title>06SADBERGE VILLAGE BUCK INN</title>
		<content> There used to be four public houses   
 in Sadberge but there are only two    
 now,the{Buck Inn}and the{Three Tuns.  
 I am going to tell you what happens in
 the Buck Inn because thats the pub my 
 dad goes to.It is called the Buck Inn 
 because a man called{John Buck,}who   
 lived a long time ago left a lot of   
 money to be used for the poor people  
 of Sadberge.On the pub sign is a      
 picture of him with a bag of money.   
 People go to the pub to meet their    
 friends,play dominoes or darts,have a 
 bar meal or a drink of beer.Children  
 are not usually allowed in the pub but
 sometimes we can go in on a Sunday    
 dinner time for a Coke or orange      
 drink.The Buck is open from 11am to   
 3pm and from 6pm to 11pm.Most people  
 drink beer which costs 70p a pint.You 
 can also buy whiskey,gin and rum.
