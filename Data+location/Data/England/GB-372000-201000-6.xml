		<content>   There used to be a Roman road which 
 passed through modern day Cambridge.  
 It went from Aust to Gloucester.      
   Changes in the last forty years     
 include the river Cam being widened,  
 the A38 road being sunk twice, and the
 M5 being built.The A road declined in 
 importance when the M5 was built but  
 in the last few years the traffic has 
 mounted up again.                     
   Although the area being surveyed is 
 predominantly rural there is still    
 quite a lot of transport. The A38 cuts
 right through the area, through       
 Cambridge and past Gossington.The M5  
 motorway runs through the area running
 roughly parallel to the A38.The main  
 railway line passes through the South 
 of the area,running under the motorway
 and A38.There is also the A4135 which 
 branches off the A38 to Dursley.
