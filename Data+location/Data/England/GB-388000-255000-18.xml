 man and his wife with 1 part-time

 during summer and Christmas hoildays. 
 The working hours are 6.30a.m. to     
 8p.m.                                 
{BREEDING}-Great Danes are bred at the 
 kennels,but Border Collies and German 
 Shepherds are the most popular breeds.
{CARE}-There are 64 dog pens and 50 cat
 kennels. The dogs are exercised in the
 morning and at night in a 3 acre field
 then, they are put in large runs      
 before going back into pens. The pens 
 are cleaned once a day and whenever   
 necessary.                            
{AREA}-There is no problem with noise  
 from the kennels,as they are situated 
 away from other houses. The kennels   
 have a total area of 11 acres. Some of
 this ground is taken up by several    
 fields                                </content>
