		<title>10Scotch Quarry            (C)</title>
		<content>Scotch Quarry is on Dale Street in the 
Primrose area of the city. It was used 
as a Limestone Quarry until the Second 
World War,then as a tip by the County  
Council until l978. In 1979 it was     
proposed to develop the site as a      
children's Summer playground. Local    
residents objected to the plan because 
they thought it would attract hooligans
and vandals. At a public meeting Cllr  
Mrs J Yates said "This area is where   
700 children living in terraced houses 
have nowhere to play except the street"
and she urged them to "see how the     
scheme worked". With the aid of the    
Manpower Services Commission, the work 
of landscaping the park began in 1983  
and the park opened in 1984.During the 
Summer holidays a playscheme operates  
in the park and various activities and 
outings are arranged, supervised by a  
full-time activities organiser.        </content>
