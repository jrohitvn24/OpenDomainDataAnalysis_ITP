		<title>06"THE POPLARS"</title>
		<content> "The Poplars " has been open for just 
 over forty years and the beer they    
 serve is made by the traditional way  
 and served from wooden casks. That's  
 probably why most Daddies go there. It
 got its name from the lombardy poplar 
 trees outside. "The Poplars" has just 
 been decorated and has a new sign     
 saying "THE POPLARS - WADWORTHS" .The 
 pub looks a lot better now it's a     
 creamy green. It's good because when  
 you take your children, there is a    
 large field to play in safely. When   
 the cricketers are playing the adults 
 can watch them. There are tables to   
 sit at while you watch. We play chase 
 round the cricket square. If a man    
 knocks a ball over the hedge he scores
 six but is out . There are also lime  
 trees .In July we play with white     
 fluff that comes off the trees.
