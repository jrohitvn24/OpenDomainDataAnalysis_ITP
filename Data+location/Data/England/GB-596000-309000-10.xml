		<title>10LIFESTYLES IN TOFTWOOD</title>
		<content>                                       
 People felt that more playing area    
 facilities ought to be provided for   
 children. Almost all homes with       
 children had either a computer or a   
 video and on average the children     
 watch 4 hours of television each day. 
 Several people complained about the   
 lack of facilities in Toftwood and    
 they had to travel 2 miles into       
 Dereham for everything they needed.   
 Most households had a car, which is   
 just as well as there is a very       
 infrequent bus service to Toftwood.   
 The old people were the ones who      
 complained most about the lack of     
 shops and the problems of transport.  
 Some of them seemed lonely and kept us
 talking for a long time. Most people  
 seemed to like living in Toftwood.
