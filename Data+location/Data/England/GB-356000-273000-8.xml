		<title>08FARMING _ CLEE HILL AREA</title>
		<content>     In the area, the farmland is      
 mostly used for{grazing, hay making   
{and silage,}because the ground is not 
 suitable for corn. On the higher      
 common land, the grassland is mainly  
 used for{sheep grazing.}There are also
 a few{beef cattle.}On the lower       
 ground, around Hope Bagot and Whitton,
 some{corn}is grown. Here, the good    
 fields are{strip grazed}by{dairy      
{cattle.}The ground is moist and the   
 grass grows in a short time. Some of  
 the milk is sent to Cadbury's and some
 is bottled and sold locally. The      
 farms on the higher land have to      
 shelter their sheep in the winter     
 because of severe weather conditions. 
     On Clee Hill there is a small{    
{turkey farm.}They hatch the eggs there
 and bring up the little chicks. The   
 chicks are then sent to another farm  
 to be fattened up for slaughter.      </content>
