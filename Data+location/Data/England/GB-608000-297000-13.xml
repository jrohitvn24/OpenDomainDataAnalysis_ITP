		<title>13FARMING - WATTLEFIELD HALL</title>
		<content> Wattlefield Hall stands on a farm of  
 1000 acres, 2/3 grow winter cereals,  
 such as barley and wheat, and 1/3     
 produces sugar beet which is          
 transported to Bury St Edmunds to be  
 processed. The surrounding fields were
 used to grow wattle for building many 
 years ago. The building is partly 17th
 century and partly Victorian, built in
 Elizabethan style. The old stable is  
 now used for cars, but a new stable   
 provides accommodation for 13 race    
 horses. Ther are also 16 bullocks     
 which will be kept for one year. We   
 saw 4 foals with their mothers in the 
 paddocks. The farm is classified as a 
 mixed farm, mainly arable with pasture
 for the animals. There are 6 workers  
 on the farm. A large pond outide the  
 house is the start of the river Bays  
 and contains many roach.
