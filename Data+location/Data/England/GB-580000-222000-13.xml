		<title>13VILLAGE LIFE,STISTED</title>
		<content>{*}Mrs.Earle has lived in the area all 
 her life.She is now aged seventy-four.
 She enjoys the community spirit and   
 quiet of the village and spends some  
 of her spare time supporting the      
 Womens'Institute,Mothers'Union and    
 Community Association.                
{*}She shops locally as the village    
 shop stocks most of what she needs and
 it is difficult for the old to get out
 of the village to shop elsewhere.She  
 has seen the population of the village
 decline although the number of houses 
 has increased;there are now more,but  
 smaller,families.The younger people   
 have their own cars and do not need   
 a bus service.Consequently this is    
 infrequent and expensive(65p to       
 Braintree).The village no longer has a
 doctor or dentist,but a district nurse
 will call if requested.Sheltered      
 housing for the elderly is needed.    </content>
