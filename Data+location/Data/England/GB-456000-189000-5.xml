		<title>05Dart's Farm, Mackney.</title>
		<content>{Dart's Farm} Dart's Farm is at Mackney
which is a small hamlet near Brightwell
It is a large farm and was visited by a
group of Chinese visitors a few years  
ago. Mr Dart has been at the farm for  
25 years and the farm has won lots of  
cups in shows for the cows. There are  
240 cows and 4 bulls on the 2,000 acre 
farm. There are also 8,000 sheep and   
2,000 pigs. A litter of pigs varies    
between 6-18 piglets. My father works  
for Mr Dart and helps look after the   
cows.He has won two cups himself.      
During the winter I go beating during  
Partridge shooting on the farm. I have 
to help chase the birds out of hedges  
for Mr Dart and Angus Dart to shoot.
