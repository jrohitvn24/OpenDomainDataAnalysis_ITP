		<title>11EASTERN WELLS</title>
		<content> Eastern Wells is a residential suburb 
 of Wells. The Bath Road which is a    
 l9th century mail coach route from    
 London to Exeter runs through the     
 suburb and along it are a number of   
 l9th century houses. Housing developed
 along it in a continuous line between 
 the wars, with typical semi_detached  
 houses and bungalows. After the war a 
 small council estate  called Churchill
 Road was built on the northern side   
 and later, during the fifties and     
 sixties, the King Castle and Woodbury 
 Avenue estates were built for private 
 residential use on the southern side. 
 Further building in this area is a    
 problem because the houses lie in a   
 valley and building higher up the     
 slopes would be intrusive and is      
 prohibited by planning restrictions.  
 Consequently, more recent growth of   
 Wells has largely occurred in the West</content>
