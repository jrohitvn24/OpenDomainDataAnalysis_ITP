		<title>01General Survey</title>
		<content>    The area surveyed lies in the      
 central Cotswolds, north of Cheltenham
 at approximately 500' above sea level.
 There is only one village of any      
 importance in the survey block, this  
 is Shipton, a long straggling village 
 lying parallel with the main London   
 Road, seven miles from Cheltenham.    
    The name Shipton literally means   
 cattle-enclosure or sheep farm. This  
 is of major relevance to the surveyed 
 area which is purely rural and        
 agricultural in character. The only   
 buildings of any importance today are 
 Shipton Manor, the two churches, and  
 the Frogmill. Today, with the         
 importance of the motor car, the      
 village is still growing in size and  
 the majority of the villagers work    
 either in Cheltenham or Gloucester.
