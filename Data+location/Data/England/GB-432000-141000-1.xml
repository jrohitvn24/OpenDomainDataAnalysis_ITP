		<title>01South-West Andover area</title>
		<content>     The south-west Andover area       
 consists of three picturesque         
 villages;{Abbotts Ann, Anna Valley and
{Upper Clatford.}The majority of the   
 land is used for farming. One major   
 road (A343 Andover to Salisbury)      
 passes through the area and it is     
 served by a network of minor roads.   
     Most of the population is employed
 in Andover or at Middle Wallop Army   
 Air Corps but there are many small    
 businesses in the villages. Older     
 schoolchildren travel to Andover but  
 those under 11 attend the local       
 primary schools in Abbotts Ann and    
 Goodworth Clatford. Farleigh          
 Preparatory School stands in parkland 
 in the centre of the area at Redrice. 
     The oldest site in the area is    
 Bury Hill, an iron age fort, south of 
 Anna Valley.The newest site is an     
 estate of houses in Abbotts Ann.      </content>
