		<content> The Hampshire and Taunton Record      
 Offices supply much of the history    
 about this area. Other sources include
 two libraries at Petersfield and      
 Winchester.                           
  There are many Tumuli in the area,and
 perhaps the most interesting is       
 Bordean (Burial Valley), where the    
 tumulus has an entrenchment around    
 it. Entrenchments at Froxfield are    
 Anglo-Saxon and thought to be the     
 boundary between the West Saxons and  
 the South Saxons. The 'Top Ten'       
 landmarks in the area are as follows:-
 the Froxfield entrenchments, Bordean  
 House, the church, the farmhouse at   
 Manor Farm,several 18th century houses
 ,Langrish House, the Dovecote at Manor
 Farm, War Hill (where there was a     
 skirmish during the Civil War), Park  
 Farm (granted free of tithes(taxes)), 
 and Limekiln Copse.                   </content>
