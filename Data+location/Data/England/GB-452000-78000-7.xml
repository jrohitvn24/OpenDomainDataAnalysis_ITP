		<content>  If you would like to see historical  
 places in Wroxall then you can go to  
 Appuldurcombe House, the Obelisk,     
 Capers,Manor Farm, Cooks Castle and   
 Free Mantle Gates.                    
 Appuldurcombe House is the biggest and
 the best place to go to.              
  On Appulducombe Down to the west of  
 Appulducombe Park is the {Obelisk.}It 
 was once 70 feet high but was badly   
 damaged by lightning in 1831.It was   
 built by Sir Richard Worsley in 1774  
 in memory of his relative Sir         
 Robert.Now it is 18 feet high,and was 
 rebuilt in 1983 by General Sir Richard
 Worsley.                              
   Godshill Parish Council is looking  
 through its records to find out when  
 Sir Robert Worsley died because there 
 are two different dates on the        
 Obelisk.
