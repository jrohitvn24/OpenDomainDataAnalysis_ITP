		<content> A few barns, a pond and some uneven   
 ground remain from Manor Farm,        
 Honeydon, home of our only candidate  
 for world celebrity. Mary Fielding,   
 future wife of Hyrum, the brother of  
 Joseph Smith founder and first        
 President of the Mormon Church, lived 
 there until 1834, with her Methodist  
 family. Mary followed her brother and 
 sister to Canada, where they all      
 became Mormon converts. Her brother   
 temporarily returnedand unsuccessfully
 tried to convert local Methodists. In 
 America Mary met and married Hyrum, a 
 widower with 5 children. While the new
 church was struggling for existence   
 against savage attacks, she had 2     
 children. Then her husband and        
 brother-in-law were imprisoned and    
 killed by a mob in Carthage Gaol. With
 7 children Mary trekked to Salt Lake. 
 Her son became 6th President.         </content>
