      Rookhope Primary School is a     
 small, rural village school which, at 
 present, accommodates thirty-three    
 children aged between four and eleven 
 years of age. Its pupils come from the
 village itself, two local farms and   
 the village of Eastgate.              
      The school has two classes; Class
 Two has twelve children aged four to  
 seven years,  whilst Class One has    
 twenty-one children aged seven to     
 eleven years old.                     
      There are twelve boys and        
 twenty-one girls presently working in 
 the school.                           
      School numbers are expected to   
 remain in the middle thirties for     
 several years to come.
