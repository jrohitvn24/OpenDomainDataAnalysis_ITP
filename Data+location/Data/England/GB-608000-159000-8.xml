		<title>08Wild flowers in Blean Woods</title>
		<content> A great many wild flowers can be seen 
 at the edges of woodland in this area.
 During a walk in August, over 20      
 species were observed in bloom.  The  
 most prolific being the pale yellow   
 wood cow wheat/MELAMPYRUM PRATENSE/   
 along the rides where selective       
 weedkilling has taken place.          
 This plant is eaten by the larvae of  
 the Heath Fritillary butterfly which  
 can be seen in June. In the clearings 
 a large amount of Bay Willowherb was  
 seen.                                 
 Groups of acid loving plants are to be
 found in small areas including the    
 Heath spotted Orchid /SIEGLINGIA      
 DECUMBENS/, Heather and various       
 Sedges.                               
 Recently coppiced areas provide       
 habitat for many of the more common as
 well as some unusual flora.
