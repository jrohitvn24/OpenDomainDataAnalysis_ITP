		<content>  Our day starts when father rushes    
 into the kitchen,in a suit,grabs at a 
 piece of toast smothered in           
 marmalade,collects the paper and his  
 leather briefcase and is gone.He      
 drives to work in his Sierra.Father   
{works in Birmingham}with computers.   
 When father returns home about six    
 o'clock the family would have a large 
 meal together consisting of meat,     
 potatoes, carrots, peas and followed  
 by a sweet. After dinner the family   
 watch "Are you being served" and "T.J.
 Hooker" until about nine o'clock when 
 the children go to bed and read.      
  On a typical saturday the children   
 watch the Saturday T.V and cartoons.  
 After that they might play on the{home
{computer}that most families have. Or  
 outside on{B.M.X's,rollerboots}and    
 skateboards. Or play with pets.Lunch  
 would probably be a snack.            </content>
