		<title>15JUVENILE JAZZ BAND</title>
		<content>  A Juvenile Jazz Band is a marching   
 band for children between the ages of 
 5 and 18.                             
  These are the instruments that we    
 have in our Jazz Band:maces,banner,   
 shield, kazzoos, bass drum, side drums
 and cymbals.A Kazzoo is about 35cm    
 long,and is shaped like a cone.It has 
 a reed in it and that is what makes   
 the sound when you play it.           
  Sometimes,on a weekend,we go to      
 carnivals to compete and try to win   
 medals.We have practice on a Thursday 
 from 6-8:30pm and sometimes on        
 Tuesdays.The colour of our uniforms is
 brown and cream,and the people on the 
 maces and the one on the bass drum    
 have white and gold ones.There is a   
 trainer,secretary,chairman, vice-chair
 man and treasurer.They form the       
 committee.                            
                                       </content>
