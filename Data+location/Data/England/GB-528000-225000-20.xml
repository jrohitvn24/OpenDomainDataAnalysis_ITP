		<content> The majority of people would like the 
 community to remain unchanged or even 
 to go back to a self-contained village
 community 'like the old days'. It is  
 the rural way of life, the peace &amp;    
 quiet (the owl hooting is still the   
 loudest noise at night round Ardeley  
 Green) that attracts the newcomers,   
 who are prepared to commute to gain   
 these benefits. But change is         
 unavoidable. A few decades ago the    
 influence of 'the big house' was      
 integral in the village &amp; there was   
 still a touch of feudalism. This is no
 longer the case &amp; in both Walkern &amp;   
 Ardeley the occupants of the big      
 houses no longer play a central part  
 in the life of the community. If      
 Stansted Airport undergoes major      
 development or if Stevenage expands   
 markedly our communities could have a 
 very different future.                </content>
