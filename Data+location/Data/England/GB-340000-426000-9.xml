		<content> Originally the fair was held on the   
 village green which is now the war    
 memorial. The Great War ended an era  
 in Club Days, except for an August    
 Monday in 1919 which was part of the  
 peace celebrations. The local churches
 organised a procession which took on a
 religious theme, and this was the     
 beginnings of the modern form of Club 
 Day. Today, after the procession a    
 wreath is laid at the Cenotaph in the 
 Memorial Gardens, to remind us of the 
 local people killed in the two world  
 wars. On 23rd August 1944 an American 
 aeroplane, travelling during a        
 thunderstorm, crashed onto the Church 
 of England school in Freckleton. Many 
 children and 2 teachers were killed,  
 along with some local residents. This 
 sad event is commemorated every year  
 by prayers and the laying of a wreath 
 on Club Day at the victims' mass grave</content>
