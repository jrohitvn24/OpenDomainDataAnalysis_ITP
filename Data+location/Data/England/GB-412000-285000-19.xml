		<content>Twenty questionairs were distributed   
to Garretts Green Industrial Estate and
twelve were returned.Generally the     
firms were quite small, only two       
employing more than one hundred people 
and the rest employing fewer than      
forty. Seven firms were expanding and  
only two have made employees redundant 
in the last twelve months, which is    
against the current trend of           
regression. Industry on the estate is  
very diverse; 9 firms are manufacturing
and 3 are service industries, but by   
walking round the estate we saw firms  
making concrete, windows and ice-cream 
and offering services like dairy       
deliveries. One firm on the estate     
employs mainly handicapped people, but 
it, like many of the others, has a     
widespread market. Firms export to all 
5 continents and deal with e.g. China  
&amp; Saudi Arabia.7 firms hope to expand. </content>
