 the Christian Saxon who is closely    
 linked with Steyning.                 
  New buildings are being errected     
 everywhere.It is expanding rapidly.

 work in bigger towns.Although some    
 citizens own shops and work locally.  
 The Steyning area is attractive and   
 many tourists come in the summer.     
  It is situated in a convenient place 
 being just next to the Sussex Downs   
 and near to the sea.Sometimes thick   
 fog covers the town.                  
  The town of Steyning is very         
 independent having its own public     
 services and sporting facilities as
