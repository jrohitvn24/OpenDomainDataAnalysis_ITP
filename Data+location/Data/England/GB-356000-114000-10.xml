 This page shows a day in my life.     
 I am eleven years old. The            
 first thing I do in a day is have     
 breakfast. I usually have toast and a 
 cup of tea. Then I get ready for      
 school and off I go. It usually takes 
 me a quarter of an hour to walk to    
 school from where I live. Once we get 
 to school the bell goes and we go in  
 for lessons. Then when its playtime I 
 just run around with my friends. In   
 the afternoon when the bell goes for  
 hometime,I pack up and walk home. When
 I get home I have a drink and sit     
 down,then I get changed and go out to 
 play. At eight o'clock I come in and  
 watch television,then go to bed early 
 for school in the morning. When I go  
 to bed I read  until I'm tired enough 
 to go to sleep.
