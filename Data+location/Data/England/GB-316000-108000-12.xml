		<title>12SMEATHARPE - TRANSPORT</title>
		<content> Smeatharpe has no public transport.   
 However a local private coach company 
 runs a bus which passes through the   
 village to Taunton every Friday.      
 The Post Office runs a daily one-way  
 service from Honiton to Smeatharpe    
 with a Post Bus collecting mail from  
 all the villages on the way.          
 The free Hospital Car Service takes   
 people who do not have their own      
 transport to hospital clinic appoint- 
 ments, chiropodist etc.               
 Most people in Smeatharpe work in     
 Exeter or Taunton and need a car to   
 get there.  Many wives at home have no
 transport during the day.             
 A car is almost essential for recrea- 
 tion, surgery visits and shopping in  
 the towns.  Otherwise, the residents  
 who have none must rely on their neigh
 -bours for lifts.  Some have bicycles 
 and mopeds etc. for short trips.      </content>
