 Woodman's Farm has 1200 acres         
 in this area.It is used as follows:   
 (a) 500 acres of rotational grassland 
 to feed a 300 cow Dairy Unit,based at 
 Avington Manor.                       
 (b) 700 acres of cereals which is made
 up of 500 acres of winter wheat and   
 200 acres of spring barley.  Woodman's
 farm is immaculately                  
 kept and highly organised. He keeps   
 Friesian dairy cows. He employs a     
 manager,a full-time secretary and a   
 game-keeper.The owner lives in a large
 farmhouse and is a well respected     
 local personality.                    
 One point of interest is that part of 
 his farm was used as a Military Camp  
 during World War 1 (1914-18).Signs of 
 this still exist eg rusty             
 bedsteads,the remains of an old       
 railway,which brought in supplies.    </content>
