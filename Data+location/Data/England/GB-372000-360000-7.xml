 drowsy.I turned on TV-AM.At 7:23 I had
 a cup of tea and then I got washed and
 changed and went downstairs for       
 breakfast.After that I fed the guinea 
 -pigs.Mum went off to work,dad had    
 already gone,I went to school at 8:30.
 At school when assembly had finished  
 we came back to class and did some    
 comprehension work.At 10:40 we went   
 out for break.When we came in we did  
 some arithmetic.At 12:58 I went with  
 the dinner monitors because I play my 
 cornet and I need an early dinner.    
 After dinner I wait till 12:30 then go
 for my cornet lesson.At 1:00 we did   
 more work until 2:15.After break we   
 had rounders until 3:30.After school I
 watched TV. and had tea.Then I mowed  
 the lawn, and played on the computer.I
 had a bath then I went to bed at 9:15.
