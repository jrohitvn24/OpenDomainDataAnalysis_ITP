 Although it was not always situated at
 its present site in the block,this    
 pack{dates back to the 16th century } 
 and is one of the oldest in the       
 country.At present there are{25 couple
{of foxhounds.                         
                                       
 Foxes are a problem to farmers and    
 poultry keepers and there is{very good
{support}for the hunt.At an average    
 meet there might be 40 on horse and   
 about 25 cars. Regular followers      
 include farmers, farm workers,        
 solicitors, game-keepers, estate      
 agents, binmen, coal miners and other 
 local people.                         
                                       
 The Goathland Hunt{area is diverse}and
 includes moorland, agricultural land  
 and some woodland. This will probably 
 always be a pro fox-hunting area.     </content>
