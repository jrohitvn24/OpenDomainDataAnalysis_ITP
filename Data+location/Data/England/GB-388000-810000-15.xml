		<content>  Two old ladies who used to work in   
 the fishing industry had been sitting 
 for two hours talking about filleting 
 fish when they were children.I over   
 heard them say that they used to work 
 from five in the morning to eight at  
 night.I stopped to listen.            
  They worked at Fraserburgh until they
 were moved to Aberdeen.One of the     
 ladies was once out at sea when a     
 giant whale collided with the trawler 
 which nearly overturned,&amp; they almost 
 drowned.The other one said that she   
 had just had a hot cup of tea and an  
 oatcake with cheese and it was delic- 
 ious."What is the time? one asked.It  
 must be getting late.Do you want to   
 come to my house for a Burn's Supper? 
 We'll have haggis turnips,potatoes,   
 oatmeal stuffing &amp; a small whisky."   
 "That would be nice."                 
 "I'll see you at seven."Off they went.</content>
