{NEWCASTLETON'S AUCTION MART           
                                       
   There is an Auction{Mart}at         
{Newcastleton}Village. On Tuesday the  
 14th of may 1985. Mr Inch of the      
 Auctioneers showed us round. He was   
 built in the 1880's. It is the oldest 
 Suckler Sale in the British Isles also
 it is the largest sale of Blue-Grey   
{Calves}also in the British Isles. It  
 has only slightly changed since it    
 was built in the 1880's.the{mart}has  
 an opened top roof.In those days      
 (the 1880's onwards until 1969)the    
{lambs}and{calves}were either driven   
 by train or driven on foot, when the  
 railway closed down in 1969 there     
 were lorries to drive them.There are  
 5{lamb}sales and 4{calve}sales every  
 year.-                                </content>
