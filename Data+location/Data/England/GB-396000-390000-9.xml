 A Walk Round the Country Park.        
                                       
 Our family went for a walk in the     
 Country Park. Helen and Alison fed the
 ducks while I made a list of the      
 different kind of ducks for a project 
 I was doing. We walked along the path 
 where we found some rabbits and a     
 caterpillar. We came back along a path
 where the fishermen fish from the bank
 of the lake. We saw another rabbit    
 which hopped into the undergrowth. We 
 saw some people boating on the lake.  
 While we were walking through the     
 woodland we saw an animal which looked
 like a mole and a grey squirrel which 
 ran up a tree. We then went to our car
 in the car park and rode home.
