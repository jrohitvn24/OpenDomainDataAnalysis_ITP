		<title>03Footpaths, Ecology in Upton.</title>
		<content> A large No. of footpaths radiate from 
 Upton leading off into the interesting
 villages surrounding the town.One     
 abounding in local{flora and fauna    
 starts from the playing field in the  
 direction of the cholera burial ground
 and a small nature reserve.The town is
 criss crossed with alleyways which in 
 ancient times were the old roads and  
 are now much used rights of way.The   
 river banks are very popular walking  
 grounds for those who enjoy easy      
 walking with the chance to look and   
 listen to the many sights and sounds  
 of nature.The path starting from the  
 Ham can be walked to Tewkesbury.Over  
 the bridge the right path leads past  
 the Marina along Ryall Meadow to the  
 historic village of Ripple.The path to
 the left leads either along the old   
 tow path to Severn Stoke or diagonally
 across Fish Meadow to Earls Croome.   </content>
