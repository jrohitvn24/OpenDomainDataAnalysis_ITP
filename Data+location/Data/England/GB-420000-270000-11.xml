		<title>11WROXALL:THE VILLAGE SCHOOL 2</title>
		<content> Every year the school has a{Sports Day
 in July. When Mrs.Trolley came to the 
 school,she introduced a new way for   
 Sports Day. The races used to be in   
 ages,but now they are in houses.This  
 year the school is going to have a    
 picnic and then the sports.           
                                       
 Mrs.Trolley would like to see the     
{community}join in with the school     
 more. At the moment the school        
 building is used as a polling station 
 for local and general elections,and   
 the Parish Council meets there.       
                                       
 The Headmistress writes a diary called
 a{Log Book.}In it she records what    
 happens in the school. The school     
 still has a very old Log Book,in which
 previous headteachers have written    
 about the school.
