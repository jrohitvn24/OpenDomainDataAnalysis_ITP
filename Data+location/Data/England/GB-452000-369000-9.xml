		<title>09St JOHN'S CADETS.</title>
		<content> My name is Susan Robinson and I am a  
 member of the St John's Ambulance     
 Cadets.We meet every Monday night at  
 6.00p.m.in the Langwith Colliery      
 Institute,which used to be the        
 colliery canteen before the mine      
 closed in 1979.Miss McKenzie and Mrs  
 Scott instruct the 26 members in all  
 aspects of first aid.We are taught how
 to treat wounds and fractures,the     
 bones of the body and mouth to mouth  
 resusitation.The cadets also have to  
 learn the drill for when they are     
 parading at Galas,competitions and at 
 the Rememberance Sunday Service.All   
 members over 11 years of age are      
 eligible to attend the annual camp at 
 Skegness,which is really a holiday    
 with cadets from all over the         
 country.The camp is ended with a huge 
 parade round the site,with banners    
 waving to the sound of the band.      </content>
