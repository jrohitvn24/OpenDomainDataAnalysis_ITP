		<content>{Asfordby St.Police Station}has been in
 existance since 1899,but was partly a 
 fire-station until 1979. There are 36 
 P.C's,4 of them women. In 1980 an     
 experiment called{'Community Policing'
 started. Highfields,an area which     
 experiences a lot of crime,was divided
 into 8 different beats. Each section  
 has a policeman who patrols the area  
 on foot. He is called the R.B.O.      
 (Regular Beat Officer). His aim is to 
 get to know the area &amp; the people.    
 Sometimes being known can count       
 against the policeman. One policeman, 
 dressed in plain clothes,was trying to
  atch people stealing milk. However,  
 local children recognised him as he   
 had been to the swimming pool with    
 their school. They alerted the        
 suspects,who ran off.
