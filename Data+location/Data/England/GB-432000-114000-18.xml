		<title>18A DAY IN THE LIFE OF LUCY.</title>
		<content> On Saturday mornings my digital alarm 
 wakes me up at 8 o'clock am I manage  
 to tumble out of bed and get dressed. 
 I walk downstairs and eat some toast  
 or cereal and then clean my teeth.My  
 Grandad usually visits at about 9     
 o'clock in time to take me to The     
 Southampton Junior Orchestra and my   
 Mum and Sister into town.At orchestra 
 I play the flute and we play music by 
 Handel and Mozart .I stay at orchestra
 for two and a quarter hours and at    
 quarter to twelve we all drive home . 
 My Grandads car is a Lada Saloon and  
 it seems quite small in comparison    
 with my Dads Austin Princess.         
     When we get home we have a cup of 
 tea and then my Dad comes home from   
 playing golf at Bramshaw.My Grandad   
 then goes home and then we have lunch.
 For lunch we have a snack like        
 crackers and cheese or beans on toast.</content>
