		<content>}THE POPULATION IN OUR AREA COMES IN   
 TWO MAIN GROUPS.  THE RAF MARRIED     
 QUARTERS ATTACHED TO THE RAF STATION  
 AT ODIHAM ARE, PARTLY, IN OUR AREA.   
 IN THESE QUARTERS, MOST OF THE        
 FAMILIES ARE YOUNG AND DO NOT STAY IN 
 THE AREA LONG.  THE OTHER MAIN ELEMENT
 OF POPULATION IS BASED ON THD TWO     
 VILLAGES OF LONG SUTTON AND SOUTH     
 WARNBOROUGH.  IN THESE TWO VERY SMALL 
 VILLAGES MANY OF  THE PEOPLE ARE      
 FAIRLY WEALTHY BECAUSE THE HOUSES ARE 
 USUALLY VERY VERY EXPENSIVE.  THERE   
 ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE SMALL 
 COUNCIL ESTATES IN THE TWO VILLAGES   
 BUT MOST PEOPLE OWN THEIR OWN HOUSES. 
 IN A SMALL SURVEY THAT WE TOOK, WE    
 DISCOVERED THAT ONLY 6% OF OUR PARENTS
 HAD BEEN BORN IN OUR AREA.            
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
