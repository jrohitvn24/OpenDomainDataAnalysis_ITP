		<title>18LAND USE IN RURAL CORNWALL</title>
		<content> A number of different land uses make  
 up the area around{Bofarnel}. The main
 railway line into the Southwest is the
 main {transport}feature whilst the {  
{River Fowey}flows through on its way  
 to the South coast. Agriculturally the
 predominant land use is permanent     
 pasture and grass for silage, however,
 the higher, gentler{slopes}are given  
 over to wheat. Bordering both sides of
 the River Fowey is deciduous woodland 
 and one is able to follow this river  
 by walking along the beautiful {      
{Lanhydrock}National Trust trail. Land 
 is also given over to coniferous      
 woodland in the {Brownqueen           
{Plantatiion.}In the past there was {  
{employment}in the China-Clay sheds but
 these are long closed and used by     
 smaller enterprises.
