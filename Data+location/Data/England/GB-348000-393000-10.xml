		<title>10Homes in St.Helens</title>
		<content> Like most other places,St.Helens has  
 many different types of housing.Near  
 to the centre of the town there are a 
 lot of terraced houses.These are      
 joined together in a row,with up to   
 twenty houses,or sometimes more,in one
 long block.They usually have a back   
 yard opening onto an entry.Not many   
 have front gardens.                   
    Further away from the centre there 
 are houses and bungalows.These are    
 sometimes detached while others are   
 only semi-detached.They usually have a
 garden at both back and front.They    
 often have a garage at the side of the
 house.Most of these houses and        
 bungalows have three bedrooms,although
 some of these are very small.         
    Not everyone owns their own home   
 many rent their house from St.Helens  
 Council.
