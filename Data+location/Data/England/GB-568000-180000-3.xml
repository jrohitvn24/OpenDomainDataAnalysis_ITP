		<content>   The village remained basically an   
 agricultural community until the      
 middle of the 20th century.The notable
 exceptions to this were the building  
 of an explosives factory on the       
 marshes to the east of the village in 
 the years before the First World War  
 and the development of the large oil  
 refineries on the same site after the 
 Second World War.These projects       
 obviously brought industry to the     
 area. However,it was the development  
 of Stanford le Hope and its           
 neighbouring village of Corringham    
 into dormitory settlements of London  
 that led to the building of large     
 housing estates.This has developed to 
 such an extent that both villages have
 now merged to form one continuous     
 built up area.
