		<title>08A Local Dairy Farm.</title>
		<content> The Woolley family run a mixed        
 farm; dairy, sheep and arable,but the 
 dairy part is most important for they 
 have 200 cows.                        
   In summer time the cows are kept in 
 the fields where they feed on grass,  
 but in the winter they are kept in    
 sheds and fed on silage,a kind of     
 pickled grass, which is produced on   
 the farm.The cows are also fed        
 cowcake, a mixture of grains and      
 important proteins,while they are     
 being milked.                         
   Milking takes place twice a day,    
 starting at 4.30 am. and 1.30 pm.Each 
 milking session takes three people 4  
 hours to complete, even using modern  
 machinery.                            
   The milk is pumped into 3 tanks     
 ready for the milk lorry to collect it
 and take it to Long Clawson Dairy ,5  
 miles away,for treatment and bottling.</content>
