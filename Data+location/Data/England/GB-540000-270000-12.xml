		<title>12Charities in Willingham</title>
		<content> The main charities in the village are 
 the{Willingham Parochial Charities}and
 the{Josiah Smith Homes,}which were    
 built 19 years ago. The main          
 income is from the letting of         
 land owned by the trust.In 1984       
 the trust spent about Â£1,100 on       
 maintenance, rates, insurance, etc.   
 There are 14 residents in the homes   
 who are visited daily by a caretaker. 
 The old people are self-sufficient as 
 far as possible although the gardening
 and some shopping is done for them.   
{Meals on Wheels}provides cooked meals 
 on some days. Many residents have pets
 for company.                          
 The{Salvation Army,}the{Red Cross}and 
 the{British Legion}also provide help  
 and support for those in need in the  
 village.                              
 The{Willingham British School Trust   
 gives grants for educational needs.   </content>
