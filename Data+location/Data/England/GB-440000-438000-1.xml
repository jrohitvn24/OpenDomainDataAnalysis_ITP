		<title>01Introduction-ABERFORD AREA</title>
		<content> Our block is a rural area containing a
 mixture of farmland and woodland. The 
 farmland is largely used for crops    
 with a few examples of livestock. Few 
 people live here except for farmers,  
 there are some secluded private       
 houses, and inhabitants in the        
 northern tip of the village of        
 Aberford. Two main roads, the A1 and  
 the A64, cross each other within the  
 block, and both have service stations 
 and Little Chefs on them. The northern
 section of the block includes land    
 belonging to the Bramham Estate. The  
 most impressive feature in the whole  
 block in Becca Hall, which dates back 
 to the eighteenth century and is now  
 owned and used by the Central         
 Electricity Generating Board. There is
 also a very hard to distinguish Roman 
 road in the North East section of the 
 block.                                </content>
