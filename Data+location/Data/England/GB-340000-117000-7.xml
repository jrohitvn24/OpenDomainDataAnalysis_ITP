		<content> Some farms do dairy farming. They have
 to get up early every morning to milk 
 the cows, so the milk tankers can take
 it to the dairy to be bottled for us  
 to drink. Some farmers in our area    
 have given up dairy farming this year 
 and have changed to beef and growing  
 crops. The beef farmers have cows to  
 fatten up. Then they take them to     
 market to be sold. They are then      
 killed and the butcher sells the meat.
 Most farmers here grow crops. A lot of
 them grow fruit and vegetables, which 
 have to be harvested and sold in the  
 shops. A lot of the fruit farms round 
 here let you go and pick your own -   
 especially strawberries and           
 raspberries. Quite a few people can   
 get jobs picking apples in September. 
 There is one fruit farm that grows    
 blackcurrants to sell to a factory to 
 make a blackcurrant drink.            </content>
