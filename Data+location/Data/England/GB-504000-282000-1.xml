 Sunday 21st May, 1985                 
                                       
6.00am I had a midnight feast with my  
cousin called Andrew and with my       
brother who is called Simon. 9.30am    
We went outside to play football,      
there are two goals and you have a     
ball between two teams and you have to 
score as many goals as you can in a    
certain time. 12.30pm We had dinner    
and we had roast lamb, boiled          
potatoes, broccoli, carrots and gravy. 
2.00pm We got ready to go out and we   
were going to have a ride on a steam   
train and we had some crisps. 3.00pm   
We went to look at some more trains    
which had to be mended. 3.10pm We went 
home and there was a gated road and    
Andrew and I opened one of the gates.  
5.15pm Tea with fish fingers. 8.45pm   
Bedtime.                               </content>
