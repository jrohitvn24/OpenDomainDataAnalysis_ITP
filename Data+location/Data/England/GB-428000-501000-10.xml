		<title>10Recreation in the Cowtons</title>
		<content> In East Cowton the Sports &amp; Social    
 Committee plays an important role in  
 recreation. It supports new clubs and 
 gives them financial aid if needed.   
 It holds monthly whist drives in the  
 Winter months and organises 2 supper  
 dances per year. The highlight of the 
 year is Village Week held in July.    
 The committee collates all groups in  
 the village and activities for diff-  
 erent ages take place each day. The   
 week ends with the Annual Sports and  
 fancy dress parade. Every 2 months a  
 Folk and music evening is held in East
 Cowton village hall. Local and Semi - 
 Proffesional acts entertain and are   
 very popular. In North Cowton, leisure
 is less organised. Occasionally discos
 and cocerts take place in the village 
 hall, mostly as fund raisers. There is
 an annual Sports Day with a small fair
 and fancy dress competition.          </content>
