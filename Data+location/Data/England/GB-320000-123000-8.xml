 The smallest baby born at Taunton's   
 Musgrove Park Hospital left for home  
 on Monday .....weighing just 3\lb.    
  Emma Woodley weighed a mere 1lb 5oz  
 when she was born to a former         
 Wellington woman 11 weeks ago.        
  Emma was born ten weeks              
 prematurely,delivered by Caesarian    
 section,after 29-year-old Mrs. Judith 
 Woodley was taken to hospital with    
 high blood pressure.                  
  Initially there were                 
 complications,and the baby received   
 antibiotics to combat two serious     
 infections.She was kept in an         
 incubator until last weekend.
