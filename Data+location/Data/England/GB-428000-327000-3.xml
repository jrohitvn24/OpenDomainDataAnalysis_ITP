   In 1985 there are 209 children      
 on the school roll. The school was    
 built in two phases. The first phase  
 was built in 1970, now the infant     
 area,and opened on February 1971.In   
 1973 the present lower junior area was
 built.                                
   In the school there are eight       
 teachers,two welfare assistants,a     
 clerical assistant,a cook and her two 
 assistants.We also have two caretakers
 and a cleaner.                        
    The building is separated into     
 three units; infants, lower juniors   
 and upper juniors.Each of the lower   
 junior classes has a mixture of first 
 and second year children and the upper
 junior classes have a mixture of third
  and fourth years.The school is sited 
 centrally in the village.             </content>
