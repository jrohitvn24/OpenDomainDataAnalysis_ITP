    These are the rules for Polo.      
 One person is on,that person chooses a
 category,the other players become a   
 name of something in that category .  
 That person is told the names,but not 
 who is which.Then he now calls one of 
 the names .The person of that name has
 to beat the person on,from the other  
 end of the playground back to their   
 place. When the people cross the line 
 they have to shout polo, the fisrt to 
 shout polo is on.  BY RACHAEL W.
