		<content> Nortonbury is a small hamlet          
 NE of Norton village comprising a few 
 dwellings,a mill and a farm.Nortonbury
 farm is owned by the Letchworth Garden
 City Corp.They have owned it for ten  
 years.The farm house is now let to the
 scouts and guides.Some of the         
 buildings are not used anymore.The    
 cattle shed is used as stables but the
 grain store is still used for grain.  
 It is hoped that in the future there  
 will be a craft centre in some of the 
 other out buildings.The land is used  
 for crops,such as wheat,barley,oats,  
 beans,peas and grazing land for the   
 horses.Barley is planted in the       
 Spring.It has a lower yield than wheat
 which is ploughed in the Autumn.Barley
 is harvested first.They get a yield of
 three to three and a half tons of     
 wheat and two to two and a half tons  
 of barley per acre.                   </content>
