		<title>14T.V.PROGRAMME SUMMARY(1)</title>
		<content>{*}In the early 1980's Anglia          
  Television transmitted a programme   
 about Stisted,"Portrait of a Village".
{*}Buildings in the village were the   
 first topic considered.Some are very  
 old,quite a lot new.The most unusual  
 are those designed by Thomas Watts,   
 imported in the 1830's by the then    
 squire,Onley Saville Onley.These      
 incorporated candystick chimneys,each 
 of a different design,over half-      
 timbered structures.Watt's tombstone  
 in All Saints' churchyard features one
 such minaiture chimney.Stisted Hall,  
 the former manor,is presently a county
 council Old People's Home.In its      
 grounds is Braintree Golf Club.       
{*}Cottage industry in the area        
 includes hand-made chocolate and the  
 screen-printing of self-adhesive      
 labels.Michael Rothenstein,a disting- 
 uished printmaker,works in the village</content>
