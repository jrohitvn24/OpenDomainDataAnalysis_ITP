		<content>{THE MOTORWAY,HIGHWAYS,ROADS.          
   Today we drove through Droitwich and
 on to have a look at Motorway M5      
 junction 5 improvements. We saw a lot 
 of lorries and machines as well as    
 people.It looked as though other roads
 joining this motorway were being      
 built.                                
 We know that the motorway is only 2   
 lanes wide so they are going to add   
 another lane to make 3 lanes.This is  
 due to the increase in traffic.We     
 noticed several diversion signs       
 through the town.These were directing 
 traffic from junction 5 through       
 Droitwich via the ring road.          
 We can expect much more heavy traffic 
 such as transport lorries and large   
 coaches to be using the roads in our  
 area while this work is being done.
