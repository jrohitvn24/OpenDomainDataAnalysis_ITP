		<title>19Domesday in Yaxham</title>
		<content> In 1980 a most interesting            
 collection of photographs and         
 documents was assembled for an        
 exhibition of Village life held at    
 Yaxham House. This years survey has   
 been enjoyed by the older children at 
 Yaxham School and has produced a      
 wealth of information from parets and 
 friends.  The Village news 'Bits and  
 Pieces' has carried an interesting    
 series about the history of the area. 
 As a direct result of work started    
 during the survey, the school has been
 encouraged to start the formation of  
 an archive of present-day information 
 and historical material which will be 
 available for reference to children   
 and members of the public.
