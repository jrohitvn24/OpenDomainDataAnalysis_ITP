Most people have hobbies which they do 
in their leisure time. Some people have
energetic hobbies,  particularly sports
like netball, rugby and football. Most 
children like energetic hobbies. There 
are many other hobbies which are much  
quieter,for example, painting, knitting
and stamp collecting. There are many   
more hobbies which can give pleasure   
to people of all ages. For some        
hobbies, special clubs have been formed
by those interested. We conducted a    
SURVEY of hobbies. We asked 36 people  
what their hobbies were. Most of them  
had more than one hobby. The most      
popular hobbies were connected with    
football and horses. Next came stamp   
collecting and computing, followed by  
netball, reading, fishing,collecting   
postcards,bird watching, looking after 
dogs and finally cooking.              </content>
