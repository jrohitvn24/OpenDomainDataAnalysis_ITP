		<content> FUND RAISING FOR CROWLE COMMUNITY HALL
 BEGAN ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS AGO AND MUCH
 OF THE MONEY TO BUILD IT WAS RAISED BY
 LOCAL ORGANISATIONS. THE HALL         
 COMPRISES A STAGE, DRESSING ROOMS, AND
 A SMALL ROOM AND A KITCHEN AND IS IN  
 REGULAR USE. IT IS USED BY MANY LOCAL 
 ORGANISATIONS FOR MEETINGS, PLAYS,    
 SHOWS, PARTIES, DISCOS AND DANCES.    
 ONCE A WEEK A BINGO SESSION IS HELD   
 THERE TO RAISE FUNDS FOR THE HALL.    
 ANOTHER ANNUAL EVENT IS THE TOY FAIR  
 WHEN FATHER CHRISTMAS VISITS CROWLE.  
 PLANS ARE NOW IN HAND TO EXTEND THE   
 HALL AND PROVIDE FURTHER FACILITIES.  
 THE PUBLIC HALL IN EALAND USED FOR    
 SIMILAR FUNCTIONS IS THE VICTORY HALL 
 WHICH HAS RECENTLY BEEN RENOVATED. THE
 PAROCHIAL HALL IN CROWLE MAY ALSO BE  
 HIRED FOR EVENTS.
