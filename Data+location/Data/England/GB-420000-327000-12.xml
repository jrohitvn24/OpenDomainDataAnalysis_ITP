		<title>12The Stud Farm</title>
		<content>This farm is about 200 years old,but   
there are no deeds as they were        
destroyed in a fire at Rolleston Hall. 
The farm used to house the horses and  
carriages from the Hall.               
It is now a 60 acre dairy farm with a  
herd of 55 dairy cows,some hens,ducks  
and a goat.The only crop grown is grass
for the cows and hay for the winter    
feed.There is quite a lot of machinery;
2 tractors,1 muck spreader,all hay-    
making equipment,a plough,harrows,     
chain harrows and two rollers.         
The buildings are the original ones    
with slight alterations.The cows are   
milked by pipe lines.                  
There are many trees on the farm and   
all the boundaries between the fields  
are hedges,not barbed wire and fences. 
There are three spinneys with the farm 
and the trees and hedges must be       
hundreds of years old.                 </content>
