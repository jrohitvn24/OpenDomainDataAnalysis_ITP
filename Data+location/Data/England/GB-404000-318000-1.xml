		<title>01RUGELEY, STAFFORDSHIRE</title>
		<content> Rugeley is situated in the Trent      
 Valley between Stafford and Lichfield.
 The town dates back to Saxon times and
 was called "Ridge Leah" then later    
 "Ridgeley". Rugeley lies on the rising
 ground between the river and Cannock  
 Chase (some 70 square miles of forest 
 and heath) to the south. To the north 
 the flat valley is mainly covered by  
 mixed farm land. Rugeley was a small  
 market town with local industries. The
 main occupations in 1985 are in the   
 coal mine, the power stations,        
 electronics and in shops and commerce.
 New housing estates have been built   
 since 1950 for people working in these
 industries. Rugeley is separated from 
 the West Midlands conurbation by      
 Cannock Chase and is 8 miles from the 
 nearest towns of Stafford, Lichfield  
 and Cannock. The population in 1985   
 was about 30,000.                     </content>
