		<content> The A683 from Lancaster to Kirkby     
 Lonsdale is one of the main roads for 
 transport.The A65 from Kendal to      
 Settle is just in the top right corner
 of our block and the railway follows  
 it but the railway isn't there        
 anymore. They used to transport the   
 milk to Leeds and cattle to the main  
 places where they could get sold,e.g. 
 Kirkby Lonsdale or Bentham.Many       
 thousands of years ago there was a    
 Roman road which was like a motorway  
 to us.There is a Roman Fort near      
 Burrow.The Roman road went from       
 Ribchester to Carlisle.               
   In the country people use cars of   
 their own and don't use buses or a    
 taxi like people in the town.There are
 now hardly any bus services.Old people
 who don't have cars find it hard to   
 get into town.
