 Worshipful Company of coachmakers in  
 1785. In the same year he filed his   
 patent for an unimmergible boat. His

 the sides and a cork belt. His first  
 boat was tried at Ramsgate. In 1786 a 
 boat converted to his design was used 
 in Bamburgh. The first purpose-built  
 lifeboat was the{Frances Ann of       
{Lowestoft.}She was in use for 50 years
