		<title>03Crowthorne Transport Options</title>
		<content>  Berkshire County Council has unveiled
 plans for a long awaited{Sandhurst _  
{Crowthorne bypass.}Four possible      
 routes costing between Â£2.75m and     
 Â£3.26m are being considered.          
                                       
  All routes use the existing Owlsmoor 
 spine road and will pass to the east  
 of Broadmoor Hospital. The options    
 differ as to where the bypass will    
 link with the A3095 north of the      
 village.Three of the options favour a 
 junction at Nine Mile Ride.           
                                       
  A County Council proposal that the   
 High St.in Crowthorne be closed to    
 traffic has been opposed by the Parish
 Council.The County Surveyor is to be  
 consulted about traffic control and   
 management both in the High Street and
 at either end of the bypass.
