		<content> The most striking feature of this     
 block is the scarp slope and the M40  
 cutting through it. On either side is 
 the Aston Rowant National Nature      
 Reserve for research into effects of  
 management on chalk grassland,its     
 botany and invertibrtes.  Areas of    
 scrub and woodland attract good       
 breeding populatins of resident and   
 migrant birds, winter migrants are    
 attracted by wild fruits and passage  
 migrants are often recorded. Beacon   
 Hill still has a beacon on it, the    
 post office telecommunications tower. 
 The A40 London to Oxford road carries 
 local traffic up though the beechwoods
 a few dwellings along side it. An     
 earlier route, several prehistoric    
 sunken ways and the Icknieldway (alon 
 the foot of the hills) are now public 
 footpaths.
