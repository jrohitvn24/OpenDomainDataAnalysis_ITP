		<title>04The Village of Skidby.</title>
		<content> Skidby is a quiet and peaceful        
 village. It is very tidy with numerous
 grass verges and trees. There are very
 few cars parked on the roadside. There
 are five farms along Main Street but  
 most people work in Beverley or Hull. 
  Skidby contains about 400 dwellings, 
 which are a mixture of old houses     
 which have been modernised and small  
 areas of modern houses. Two cottages  
 (18 and 20 Riplingham Road) are       
 boarded up and two detached houses are
 being built in front of the school.   
  There is a primary school for 60     
 children from the village and this has
 three teachers. Round the village     
 green there is a small church, a      
 Methodist chapel and a village hall.  
  The village has a post office and a  
 shop but most people shop outside the 
 village.                              
                                       </content>
