		<title>04SCHOOL SECRETARY</title>
		<content> Mrs.M.Stafford has been the secretary 
at Geddington CofE Primary School since
1966. She lives in the village and     
cycles to work arriving promptly at    
10am every day.                        
She begins by stacking 60 sandwich     
boxes neatly on an old wooden trolley, 
washing the tea mugs and preparing the 
filtre coffee ready for playtime at    
10.45am. She then begins her clerical  
duties by checking the dinner registers
and phoning the number of meals        
required through to Grange School      
Canteen, Kettering. The paperwork      
remains to be dealt with.              
At lunchtimes, she supervises the      
dinner children until 1.15pm when      
school begins. She continues with her  
duties until 2pm, when she cycles back 
home.
