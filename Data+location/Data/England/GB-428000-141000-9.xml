		<content> There is a Roman road. It is about six
 foot under the road from Amport to    
 Grateley. It is made from pebbles,    
 flint, stone and sand.                
 There is an old hedge which is 1350   
 years old. The way we worked it out   
 was to multiply the number of species 
 of tree or shrub found in the hedge by
 110 years and added 30 years.         
                                       
 i.e.  (number of species x 110 yrs)   
                           +  30 yrs   
       = Age of hedge.                 
                                       
 12 species, at least, were identified.
 It is about 1 mile south east of      
 Amport.                               
 At Gollard farm near Grateley there is
 said to be a Roman gold hoard but none
 has ever been found.                  
 There is a site of a Roman villa 3 or 
 4 miles south of Monxton.             </content>
