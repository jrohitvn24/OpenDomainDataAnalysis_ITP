		<title>15Hadley Infants and Nursery</title>
		<content>   The infant school was built in 1951 
 and,at the present time,has 149 pupils
 in its infant section and 59 in the   
 nursery school.                       
   The present Head,Miss J.Madeley,    
 confessed to us that although she     
 enjoys her job very much, it was not  
 one she had considered for herself,she
 had only applied after others had     
 suggested she should.                 
   Children start on the nursery school
 just before their fourth birthday.    
 Their schoolday is a varied one,with  
 the emphasis on the child's           
 involvement in a range of activities  
 designed to develop their perception  
 of their environment.                 
   The school was only last week the   
 target of an attack of vandalism,     
 something which is becoming all too   
 common.                               
                                       </content>
