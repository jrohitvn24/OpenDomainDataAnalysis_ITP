		<title>18Fishing:Evesbatch Court Farm</title>
		<content>   Mr. Porter's family started stocking
 their{lake}at Evesbatch Court Farm in 
 1970.  It covers 3/4 acre. It was     
 stocked with{coarse}fish, mainly carp.
 Later it was filled with different    
 species, e.g.{roach}and{tench.}In 1982
 they had 2" of rain in 20 minutes.    
 Tgis totally destroyed the crops and  
 killed the fish because the chemical  
 sprays and debris were washed into the
 lake.                                 
   He restocked the lake, but this cost
 him Â£10,000.  He got some of his money
 back by selling day tickets for Â£2 and
 evening tickets for Â£1.25 for people's
 recreation. Every 4 years the{Severn  
{Trent Water Authority}nets the lake,  
 taking out all the small carp and     
 selling them to other lakes. Mr.Porter
 makes Â£2,000 a year profit; all he has
 to do is to check the drainage, spray 
 the weeds once a year.                </content>
