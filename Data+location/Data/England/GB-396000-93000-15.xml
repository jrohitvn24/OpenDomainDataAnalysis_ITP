		<title>15Youth clubs in Upton</title>
		<content> We asked the public of Lychett Minster
 for their views on the area and       
 spacifically entertainment            
 facilities. Upton has a growing       
 residential area and a small          
 industrial estate. All the people we  
 asked said how pleasant the area      
 was. There is a growing number of     
 young married people with babies and  
 there are several groups to help      
 them. There is a Mothers and Toddlers 
 group, Play hour which is run by      
 Edaine White, as well as Sunday School
 and coffee mornings. There are youth  
 clubs for children 9 to 13 years run  
 by Mrs. C. Seed. There are Scouts     
 and Venture Scouts for the older      
 children run by Mrs. Young. There is  
 also a cricket club for the boys in   
 summer. For the girls there are       
 Brownies, Guides and the Tennis       
 Club organised by Mrs. Singleton.     </content>
