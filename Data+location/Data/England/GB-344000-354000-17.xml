		<title>17People At Play</title>
		<content>  Most of the people resident in this  
 area have lived here many years and   
 are of the older age group.These older
 people use several clubs in nearby    
 areas where they meet to chat, play   
 dominoes , bingo or have lunch.       
     People in the middle aged group   
 who have lived in the area for some   
 time tend to enjoy leisure activities 
 at home or near their own homes.They  
 enjoy gardening,reading,hockey,cricket
 football and shooting.There is a trout
 pool at Aldersey and many children and
 adults fish in local pits.A few       
 newcomers to the area go further away 
 for their leisure activities.         
     Darts,Bingo and Computer games    
 occupy many people but perhaps most   
 time is spent watching television.    
     Our children attend cubs and      
 brownie groups in nearby villages.
