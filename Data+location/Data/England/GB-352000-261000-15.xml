		<content> We talked to Mr and Mrs Jones of      
 Leysters who have lived in the village
 all their lives.                      
      Mr Jones was born in 1894,married
 at 18 and had 7 children.He worked as 
 a waggoner on a local farm doing      
 ploughing;reaping and planting.The 3  
 men made 100 gallon hogsheads of cider
 and drank them for breakfast,dinner   
 and tea,and between times carried a   
 wooden gallon barrel called a         
 'coastral'.He started work at 6.30am  
 getting horses ready and finished at  
 6.00pm for a wage of 25 shillings a   
 week.At harvest he worked all hours   
 and had no holidays.Food was carried  
 in a "frail"and eaten when the men    
 stopped for "bate".At night he would  
 do the garden and feed the pig.They   
 had no radio but he remembers the     
 first crystal set.
