		<title>13 A SCHOOL DAY IN RUGELEY.</title>
		<content>                                       
My school day starts at 7.00am. My     
clock radio wakes me. Breakfast is     
cereal honey on toast and orange       
juice. I watch T.V. for sport and news.
From home to school takes 10 minutes.  
I chat with friends then line up to go 
into school when the whistle blows at  
9.00am. The teacher calls the register 
to see if we are present. Next is      
assembly. Lessons are Maths, Language, 
Project, History and other things. We  
have Art and Craft, P.E. Games,        
Swimming and Computer work.            
There are two playtimes and a dinner   
break. I like school because I meet my 
friends.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
