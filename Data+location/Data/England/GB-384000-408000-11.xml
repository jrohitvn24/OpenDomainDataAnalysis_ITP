		<title>11Changes in Heywood.2.</title>
		<content>   Groups of {Senior Citizens }were    
 interviewed. Most are over 70 and have
 lived in Heywood all their lives. All 
 left school when they were 12 and some
 were half-timers. All said that school
 then was far stricter and some said   
 that they had had better teachers.    
 They all started work, mainly in the {
{Cotton Industry. }They spoke of long  
 hours and low pay , and most mentioned
 the short holidays,-just one week for 
 many.They talked of the unemployment  
 of the 1930's and the decline of the  
{Cotton Industry. }They mentioned their
 houses, especially the ones they grew 
 up in, and the fact that they all had 
 a shared outside toilet.Some of the   
 houses they lived in when first       
 married were still standing. They also
 talked about the old {Tramcars }and   
 how they tended to walk as often as   
 possible because it was cheaper.      </content>
