		<title>06The Bluemull Sound Ferry.</title>
		<content> The North Isles roll-on,roll-off ferry
 runs from Belmont in Unst,to Gutcher  
 in Yell and Oddsta in Fetlar.Cars can 
 be booked in advance and school       
 children always get passenger         
 priority.                             
   The ferry is run by the Shetland    
 Islands' Council and in May 1985 the  
 fare for each journey was Â£1-20 for   
 car and driver,20p for each passenger,
 all children travelled free.          
   The ferry runs daily to a time-table
 but can be specially hired or run in  
 an emergency.There are Summer and     
 Winter time-tables which vary little  
 apart from giving more and later runs 
 in Summer.Most links are from Belmont 
 to Gutcher but every day there are at 
 least two links with Oddsta,sometimes 
 via Gutcher.                          
   The ferry brings and takes mail,    
 supplies,visitors and residents.      </content>
