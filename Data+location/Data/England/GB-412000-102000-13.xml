		<content>  From Boundary Lane in the D block it 
 is possible to see the spur road to   
 Bournemouth:the A31 road.             
  The spur road is very busy all year  
 round,but especially so in the summer 
 when you can be stuck in traffic jams 
 for anything up to an hour.The traffic
 jams are a result of people making    
 their way to the beach,seaside        
 hotels,holiday camps etc.             
  However,Boundary Lane is quiet and   
 peaceful for most of the year,with few
 vehicles using it.It does get busier  
 in the summer months as on Boundary   
 Lane there are several camp sites and 
 a picnic area which are very popular.
