		<content> There is an abundance of wildlife in  
 the area. A herd of about 60{wild deer
 roam the woodlands - their numbers    
 have to be controlled to reduce the   
 damage they do.                       
                                       
 Amongst the butterflies that may be   
 found are the{Holly Blue,}which over  
 the last few years has become quite   
 rare.                                 
                                       
 The area attracts a wide variety of   
 birdlife, not only those associated   
 with the countryside but also species 
 most often seen in towns.             
                                       
 The heavy marl soil gives good        
 growing conditions for most plants but
 makes it hard work for gardeners!     
 Spring time is a delight for flower   
 lovers, with lots of violets, wood    
 anemones, primroses and bluebells.    </content>
