		<content> There are two shops in{Tytherington.} 
 One of them is a{Post Office.}This    
 also sells{drinks, confectionery}and{ 
{convenience goods.}There is also a{   
{village shop}which sells{papers,      
{sweets}and{household goods.}Residents 
 think this is sufficient.             
 Most people go out of the village to  
 do their shopping. Out of 40 residents
 who answered our questionnaire, we    
 discovered that most people went to{  
{Safeway}in{Thornbury}to do general    
 shopping ({7}people went to{Co-op, 6} 
 went to{Tesco's,}and{4}to{Carrefour.})
 From the same survey we also found    
 that most people preferred to shop    
 weekly ({6}went{daily,4 fortnightly.})
 People also get food delivered. There 
 is a{baker, milkman, fishmonger,      
{grocer,}and a{butcher}who deliver in{ 
{Tytherington.}
