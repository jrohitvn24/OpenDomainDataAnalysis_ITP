		<title>02EDUCATION- WORMBRIDGE SCHOOL</title>
		<content>{Wormbridge School}is a very old       
 building. At present 86 children      
 attend the school. We do not know how 
 old it is, but we do know that it was 
 the kitchen of a manor house which    
 stood where the school playground is  
 now. The manor house was knocked down 
 about 1700 and you can see the shapes 
 of some of its windows in the         
 playground wall. We believe that the  
 school building is older than the     
 manor house, as it has oak beams in   
 the roof, and the floorboards are very
 wide. The walls of the school are made
 of{bricks baked locally at Crizeley,  
 but part of the wall at the back of   
 the school is made of stone.          
 Underneath the school are cellars. We 
 use these to store furniture we no    
 longer use. Also behind the school is 
 the{fish pond}of the old manor house.
