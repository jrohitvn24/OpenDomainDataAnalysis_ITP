		<content> HOUSING IN MELBOURNE IS A COMPLETE    
 MIXTURE OF ALL STYLES,RANGING FROM A  
 CRUCK COTTAGE IN THE HIGH STREET      
 WHICH HAS ORIGINAL 14TH CENTURY       
 CRUCKS STILL INTACT,TO IMPRESSIVE     
 GEORGIAN AND VICTORIAN HOUSES AND 20TH
 CENTURY COUNCIL AND PRIVATE ESTATE    
 SEMI_DETACHED HOUSES.ALTHOUGH         
 MELBOURNE HAS CAREFULLY PRESERVED MANY
 OF ITS HISTORIC HOUSES,IT HAS ALSO    
 ENCOURAGED MODERN HOUSING TO FIT IN   
 CAREFULLY WITH THEM.TWO LARGE,MODERN, 
 PRIVATE ESTATES OF RED BRICK HOUSES   
 HAVE BEEN BUILT ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF   
 THE TOWN WHICH DO NOT INTERFERE WITH  
 THE MORE TRADITIONAL HOUSING.THE      
 COUNTY COUNCIL BUILT MANY COUNCIL     
 HOUSES SINCE THE END OF THE 1ST WORLD 
 WAR BUT MANY OF THESE HAVE BEEN BOUGHT
 BY THEIR OCCUPANTS IN THE 1980'S.OLDER
 SLUM TYPE HOUSES IN THE NEW YORK      
 DISTRICT WERE CLEARED IN THE 1950'S.  </content>
