		<content> We parked the car by Whites Garage    
 and then we made our way to Parr      
 Engineering and we went inside the    
 office and we saw Mr P. Wright. He    
 gave us some glasses to protect our   
 eyes.                                 
                                       
 Mr Wright took us to the store        
 room where materials are kept.They    
 showed us some nuts and bolts. Then we
 looked at a robot which punched holes 
 in a sheet of metal which worked on a 
{computer.}Then he showed us another   
 robot which can cut through 8 inches  
 of thick metal.                       
                                       
 Later we saw a big oven which baked   
 the paint. Parr Engineering make      
{tractor cabs and metal sheds}for the  
{B.B.C.}and{air venting ducts}which    
 they export to{Singapore, Egypt and   
{Libya.                                </content>
