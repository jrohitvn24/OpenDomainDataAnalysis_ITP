		<title>04Summer Fashion in Pitsea.</title>
		<content> For summer wear in 1985 I would have a
 beret made of peach coloured wool with
 a loop on top and a suit that looks   
 like a pair of trousers and a         
 tee-shirt joined together.The colour  
 of this would be peach.They would also
 be cotton.The sleeves would be half   
 way down my arm.At the end of the     
 sleeves there would be press studs    
 because the  sleeves would roll up and
 so would the trousers.The trousers    
 would be  baggy at the top and thin at
 the bottom.My socks would be white    
 cotton ones.They would be  short. My  
 shoes would be peach coloured canvas  
 shoes which would be pointed.They     
 would have rubber soles.They would be 
 slip ons.
