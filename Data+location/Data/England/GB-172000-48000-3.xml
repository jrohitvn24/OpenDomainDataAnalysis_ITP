		<title>03St. Agnes:People's attitudes</title>
		<content> St. Agnes is a very rural community,  
 and at the same time a very caring    
 one.  Various fund-raising schemes are
 organised to help local charities such
 as Cancer Research, R.N.L.I., etc.    
 The peace and quiet of days gone by is
 preferred by those with memories of   
 the village life then as opposed to   
 the tourist industry of today, which  
 is not too popular with this section  
 of the community.                     
 The surrounding areas are virtually   
 unspoilt, and many locals wish it to  
 remain so.  Older residents have no   
 ambition to travel.  Many of them have
 not been outside Cornwall; this has   
 produced a very close-knit community, 
 with rather narrow, fixed attitudes.  
 Methodism - introduced by John and    
 Charles Wesley on their visits to St. 
 Agnes - continues, and is now becoming
 a strong and influential tradition.   </content>
