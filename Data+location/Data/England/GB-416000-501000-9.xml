		<title>09New R.C.school in Richmond.</title>
		<content> The R.C. Primary School in Richmond is
 a new one. It was opened in July 1984.
    The Headmaster,Mr.M.Larkman,has    
 been with us for 16 years,since 1969  
 in the old building in Reeth Road.    
    The new school building is a brick 
 building in Cross Lanes with a pitched
 Aluminium roof. It has well insulated 
 walls and roof.In the walls are energy
 saving thermalite blocks with         
 polystyrene in the cavities.There are 
 small windows to help save heat in the
 winter.There is a computerized heating
 system powered by natural gas.It is   
 unlike schools of older design which  
 had very large windows.               
    We like the new building because it
 is good for games with playing        
 fields.In our old school in Reeth     
 Road we had no playing field or gym so
 we had to use the Convent's.
