		<content> The area splits naturally in to two   
 halves. The western half, nearer the  
 lake, contains most of the population,
 with Windermere village, the small    
 village of Troutbeck Bridge to the NW 
 and a large number of scattered,      
 detached houses, large and small.     
 Except in the NW of the area, the land
 rises quickly away from the lake to   
 about 90 metres generally. At Orrest  
 Head, just north of Windermere, it    
 reaches 250m., giving spectacular     
 views over the whole of the southern  
 Lake District.                        
 The eastern half is an undulating,    
 open area with small rocky outcrops   
 and scattered farms. The ground rises 
 gently towards the south to about     
 250m., while to the north it rises    
 towards Sour Howes (478m.), the edge  
 of the main lakeland hill mass.
