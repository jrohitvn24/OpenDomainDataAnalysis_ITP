 Mr.Ball,chairman of the Poynton       
 Council of Churches,told us that the  
 councils aim was to show the united   
 face of Christianity in the area.Five 
 denominations,Anglican,Roman Catholic 
 Baptist,Methodist and Pentacostal were
 represented on the council.Each year  
 there were 4 meetings to discuss      
 common problems,and ways in which the 
 churches could become involved in the 
 life of the community.One church      
 organisation mentioned was'Open Hands'
 whose members helped the elderly the  
 handicapped and the sick.Recently a   
 shanty had been built in the Civic    
 Hall car park,and for several days    
 people lived in it for 3 to 4 hrs     
 eating rice,and drinking water to show
 how the worlds poor lived.He said that
 church in Poynton was well attended.  </content>
