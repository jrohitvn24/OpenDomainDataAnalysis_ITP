		<title>01MERTON AREA - AN OVERVIEW</title>
		<content>The area of countryside centreing upon 
the village of Merton,Oxfordshire      
is typical of much of the agricultural 
land to be found in the north of the   
County.It is a relatively flat area of 
land which supports a mixed            
agricultural economy.Beef and dairy    
cattle are kept as are sheep.Farms are 
relatively large,most people tending to
live in the villages rather than in the
open countryside.Arable crops such as  
wheat and barley are grown.Local       
employment is scarce,most of the       
villagers commute to the local towns or
to the Government Ordinance Depot to   
work.Of particular interest are a few  
fields in the block which have been    
farmed traditionally without the use of
modern chemicals or sprays.These       
support many interesting forms of      
plantlife fast disappearing from the   
modern countryside.                    </content>
