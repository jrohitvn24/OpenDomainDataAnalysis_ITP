		<content>{St. Nicholas}church in Kemerton is    
 one of the biggest churches.The tower 
 is early English but the remainder was
 built in Victorian times.The{Ebenezer 
{Methodist}chapel at Aston Cross, the  
 smallest church in our area,{Kinsham  
{Baptist}chapel and the Old{Methodist  
 chapel in Bredon which is now closed  
 were all built in the 1700 or1800s.   
 The{Bredon Barn}was built in the 13th 
 century by the Bishop of Worcester,   
 who was the lord of Bredon Manor.It   
 is one of the largest barns in        
 England.In 1981-'82 there was a       
 massive fire at the Barn,which        
 destroyed the roof,now rebuilt.It is  
 famous for its timbers.The{Rectory,   
 once the Bishop's summer palace,was a 
 very long building,but the middle was 
 removed in 1953,and is now 2 separate 
 houses. The oldest part is 13th       
 century,but most is 17th or later.    </content>
