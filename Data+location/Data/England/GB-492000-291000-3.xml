		<title>03Housing - Deene</title>
		<content>Deene is overshadowed by Deene Hall and
its estate, but the village street is  
lined by picturesque detached cottages,
three terraced units, the old school &amp; 
schoolhouse, a large Georgian building-
part of which is Manor Farm, and the   
remainder was the Â£Seahorse' pub which 
closed in the 1970's (now uninhabited).
A second farm-Home Farm-is situated at 
the western end of the settlement.     
All homes were built of local limestone
-and in addition to slates and tiles,  
there are examples of thatching.       
                                       
Deene Hall (the Brudenell home) is also
a stone residence, developed over five 
centuries, with the extensive house and
estate buildings covering many acres.
