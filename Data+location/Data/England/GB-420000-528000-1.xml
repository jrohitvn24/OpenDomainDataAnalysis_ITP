		<title>01KING JAMES COMMUNITY CENTRE</title>
		<content>{                                      
 The Centre was opened in 1976.The idea
 was to combine{King James I           
{Comprehensive School}and the new      
{Community Centre.                     
 The Centre caters for all ages and    
 all interests,from five years to      
 ninety years,and from jewellery making
 to squash.                            
 The original idea for the Centre being
 established was for the{school pupils 
 to{mix with the public during the     
{school day.}In practice this only     
 happens on a few occasion,though the  
 assistant manager Mr.Farrer is looking
 into ways in which this can be        
 furthered.                            
 One of the problems the Centre faces  
 is being compared with a small village
 hall and a large sports complex.
