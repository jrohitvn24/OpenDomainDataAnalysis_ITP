		<title>07ALL SORTS OF AMPNEY PRODUCE</title>
		<content>  Most of the land is used for grain or
 grass production. There is one dairy  
 unit milking 239 cows. Another farm   
 buys and fattens aroud 130 calves. One
 farm rears 30 pigs, three rear sheep  
 and one is to start production of     
 sheep's milk and cheeses. 127 deer are
 being raised at Park Farm for export  
 to New Zealand and Australia. The 56  
 acres at the stud help support 22     
 cattle and 16 horses with grazing and 
 hay. There are 5 acres of strawberries
 and raspberries for PYO off the A 417.
 A vineyard produces grapes which are  
 made into wine which is for sale. Mr  
 Norris's family have farmed Lower     
 Field Farm since 1918 and he has never
 sprayed or used artificial            
 fertilisers. He also grows            
 prize-winning roses. His Christmas    
 turkeys are delicious!
