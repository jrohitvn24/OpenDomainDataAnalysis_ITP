Beyond the village centre lie the      
modern housing estates.Begun in the    
late 1950's these large estates were   
built of three and four bedroomed      
private houses.Many people moved into  
the village to these homes and commuted
to their work places.Nowadays people   
commute to jobs as far away as London, 
travelling by rail from Wellingborough 
or Northampton.House prices of between 
30-40,000 pounds make the Earls Barton 
estates attractive.However,houses with 
larger facilities are less easily      
available in the village and are very  
expensive when they do appear on the   
market.
