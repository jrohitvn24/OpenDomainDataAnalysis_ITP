		<content>  Women still seem to do the main part 
 of cooking and preparing food, but men
 and children are catching on to the   
 idea of joint work around the house.  
  The cooking of food in Kington is    
 done usually by electricity but some  
 people have gas tanks in their gardens
 so that they can use gas in the house.
 Wood burning cookers are also used.   
  Pets around the house are usually    
 cats and dogs but people are starting 
 to have hamsters and animals like     
 fish. Tinned pet foods are used mainly
 for feeding animals.                  
  During the week people usually eat   
 their main meal at night, consisting  
 of a meat, vegetables and potatoes,   
 but at the weekend people eat their   
 main meal at midday. It is traditional
 to have a roast lunch on Sundays.
