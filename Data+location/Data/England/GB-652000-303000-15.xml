		<title>15The River Side</title>
		<content> The use of the river side has changed 
 considerably in the last 20 years.    
 Much of the South Denes bank has been 
 occupied by firms connected with rig  
 supplying and pipe and equipment      
 stores. Oil platforms are built at    
 Bollard Quay on the Gorleston side, by
 Norwell. Wimpey Marine store drilling 
 muds, cement, bulk chemicals and are  
 engaged in 24 hour helicopter         
 coordination. A new customs house has 
 been built by Darby's Hard on the west
 bank, the Hard still being used for   
 small fishing vessels. Near the bottom
 of Baker St. is the lifeboat house    
 with both a fast inshore dinghy and   
 the main boat, the Barham. The ferry  
 continues to operate regularly across 
 the harbour from Ferry Hill to near   
 the Birds Eye factory and carries many
 South Denes workers in the early      
 morning and late afternoon.           </content>
