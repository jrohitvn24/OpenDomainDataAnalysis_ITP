The Gateway Club is a club for mentally
handicapped people.  About 20 people   
help with the Club.  At nearby Abingdon
they may follow a Training Scheme,     
whereby they can earn money.  About 56 
people attend the Gateway Club and they
all enjoy it very much.  They play     
games at the Club.  They go on trips   
and holidays and one of the most       
popular activities is acting.
