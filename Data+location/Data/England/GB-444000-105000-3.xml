		<content> British Aerospace are probably the    
 biggest employer in the area.The      
 company used to be Follands and this  
 is where the Gnat trainer was built.  
 This jet was made famous by the Red   
 Arrows aerobatic team.The works were  
 then taken over by Hawker Siddeley    
 company and now British Aerospace.    
  The College of Air Training was an   
 important employer and it was here    
 that many of the world's pilots were  
 trained but sadly the establishment   
 has had to close. The land which      
 includes the airstrips has been sold  
 for redevelopment.                    
  Petters is a factory which used to   
 make diesel engines but now it        
 produces refrigeration units.         
  There is an oil storage depot in the 
 area but this does not employ many    
 staff.
