		<content>  {Fr. Foster}built the school in the  
 1840s 'for the education of the lab-  
 ouring classes'. There would have been
 about eighty children in the single   
 room, which looks like a church nave  
 with a stout central beam and queen   
 post. On the roof hung the school     
 bell till it was taken down in 1967.  
 (Now it is calling the people of Mahe 
 to church, in the{Indian Ocean}! )    
 At the turn of the century they made  
 an extra room by joining up to the    
 house next door, which was built for  
 the Curate. It became Schoolhouse, for
 the Headteacher. In the sixties two   
 new classrooms were built, and the new
 playground provided contains apple    
 trees and a tall{Wellingtonia Sequoia.
 The PTA bought a swimming pool. But   
 all of a sudden there were only twenty
 children - and{threats of closure.}But
 the school remains proudly open.      </content>
