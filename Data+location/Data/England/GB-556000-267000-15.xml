		<title>15DENTISTS IN BURWELL.</title>
		<content> There is a{dental practice}in the     
 village.It has been at 25 Ness Road   
{since November 1982.}There are 4      
 dentists and they have three          
 assistants.They vary in where they    
 work though, sometimes in Newmarket   
 and Mildenhall as well as Burwell.    
 The dentist sees his patients about   
 every six months.People's main        
 problems are{tooth-decay}through      
 eating too many sweet things and not  
 enough fruit.He may see thirty        
 patients a day and about 150 during   
 the week.                             
  Children get free treatment in the   
{National Health Scheme}but adults must
 pay some of the cost themselves.
