    The Springhead Trust is a day and  
 residential study centre established  
 in 1973 to commemorate the work of    
 Rolf Gardiner. It is set in old mill  
 buildings on a site in Fontmell Magna 
 dating to before the first Domesday   
 Book.                                 
    Its aims encompass a wholistic     
 approach to man and his relationship  
 to the environment. Educational       
 courses are run for groups, local     
 and distant, of school and adult ages,
 ranging from retreats and meditation  
 through art, craft and drama to       
 detailed rural studies. All stress the
 vital link between man and the Earth  
 he inhabits. The Trust is also deeply 
 involved in the local community       
 through folk dance, local history, job
 creation, the linking of volunteer    
 organisations and education.          </content>
