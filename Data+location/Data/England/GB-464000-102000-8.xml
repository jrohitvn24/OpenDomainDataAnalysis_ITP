		<title>08  A SCHOOL DAY.</title>
		<content> On a school day I wake  between 7 and 
 8 am.Breakfast consists of  cereal or 
 toast and fried food.School starts at 
 9am. Morning break between lessons    
 consists of a quarter of an hour,with 
 a similar one in the afternoon. Dinner
 is one hour.School ends at 3.30       
 pm.Having changed school uniform,I go 
 to the shop for the "News"(local      
 paper). When I have had tea  it  is   
  5.30pm.I will then watch television  
 or play with friends or read a        
 book. Supper is a snack               
 eaten an hour before bed,which is     
 about 10pm. In the evenings I often   
 have homework to do.This should take  
 about an hour. I enjoy school because 
 I am with friends.However, it is a    
 very noisy and busy place and I find  
 it difficult sometimes to get privacy.
