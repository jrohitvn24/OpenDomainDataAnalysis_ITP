		<title>10TRANSPORT</title>
		<content>{Car}is the main means of transport for
 nearly 80% of people in this area     
 because the houses are widely spread  
 and the only{bus}service - to{Hereford
 - does not run very frequently. There 
 used to be a railway line called the  
{Golden Valley railway}which ran from  
 Pontrilas northwards but this was     
 closed some years ago. Many people    
 therefore need their cars for local   
 travel, for their work or for shopping
 in Hereford or Abergavenny and so the 
{2 garages}in Ewyas Harold are very    
 important. One of these sells{petrol, 
 deals in second-hand cars and does    
 some servicing while the other only   
 does repairs and{servicing.}About 75% 
 of people in the area buy petrol and  
 have their cars serviced locally.
