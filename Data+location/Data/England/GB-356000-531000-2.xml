		<content>  The proximity of the Lake District,  
 the Pennines,the Yorkshire Dales and  
 the Scottish Borders make Langwathby  
 and Edenhall an ideal tourist area.   
 The Eden valley offers visitors a rich
 variety of scenery.Small,unspoilt     
 villages offer their own attractions  
 of working water mills,stone circles  
 and craft work.In the upper reaches of
 the valley there is wild moorland.Two 
 long distance walks are the Pennine   
 Way and Maiden Way.These give visitors
 the opportunity of fell walking in an 
 area overlooking the four northern    
 counties.The lower reaches have sand  
 stone cliffs at Nunnery Walks and     
 Lacey Caves.The characteristic stone  
 arch bridge was washed away in heavy  
 floods in 1968.A new one was provided 
 very quickly by the army. That Bailey 
 bridge is still in use today.We look  
 forward to having a new bridge one day</content>
