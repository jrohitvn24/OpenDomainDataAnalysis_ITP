		<title>09Leisure Survey in Nuthall</title>
		<content>   We have done a survey to try and    
 find out about peoples favourite spare
 time activities. We questioned 100    
 people in the{25 to 40}age group. We  
 gave them a sheet with a list of      
 questions and asked them to choose    
 their top three activities.           
   The men voted for{playing sport}as  
 their top choice. They said they did  
 it to help keep fit, to meet people   
 and for the competition. The men's    
 second choice was watching sport, and 
 the third was watching T.V.           
   The ladies first choice was{reading,
 then came listening to music and third
 came watching T.V. They chose reading 
 because it was something they could do
 at any time, anywhere and because they
 found it relaxing.
