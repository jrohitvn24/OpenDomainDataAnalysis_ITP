{No main gas}even though we have a     
 substation in Square 2.               
{Property prices.}We are near enough to
 London for people to commute.This     
 means that houses are too expensive   
 for young people to buy.              
{Parking on the main street.}High St.  
 is very narrow and the houses have no 
 garages so cars park in the street.   
{Dangerous roads. }There are no        
 pavements in parts of the main street 
 so it is dangerous for children to    
 walk to the shops.                    
{The new flats.}There are some new     
 flats which are very tall.Everybody   
 calls them "the monstrosities".They   
 spoil the High Street.                
{No buses for the teenagers.}The last  
 bus goes to Hitchin at 6.30.This means
 it is very hard for teenagers to go   
 out in the evening.                   </content>
