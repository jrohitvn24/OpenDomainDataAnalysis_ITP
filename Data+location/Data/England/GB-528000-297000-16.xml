		<title>16Pets in the home</title>
		<content> The definition of pets in relation to 
 the animals kept by the families      
 within the grid area is rather vague! 
 We have defined it as any animal kept 
 at home rather than at a farm or small
 holding, and not kept for slaughter.  
{    Dogs            Cats              
    {Tortoise        Goldfish          
    {Tropical fish   Terrapins         
    {Rabbits         Guinea pigs       
    {Caged birds (extremely popular)   
    {Goats           Chickens          
    {Ducks           Geese             
    {Pony            Horse             
  These are the usual or popular       
 pets.The keeping of caged birds       
 (finches,canaries,budgies) seems      
 especially popular in this area.      
  There are also the less popular pets 
 such as exotic snakes,gerbils, and one
 boy even catches and keeps spiders as 
 pets!                                 </content>
