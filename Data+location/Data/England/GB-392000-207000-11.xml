		<content>   Mrs.Cove has lived at{Townsend Farm 
 since her marriage at the age of 28   
 years _ some 62 years.It was a{mixed  
{farm}_{arable}and{stock}and for many  
 years they kept a large stable of     
 shire horses to work the farm.        
   Until the end of{second world war   
 they used a mixture of cart_horses and
 tractors,before finally going over to 
 tractors in the early fifties.        
   Mrs.Cove said:"They don't farm      
 now,they rush over the land.We used   
 to have a{relationship}with the       
 animals,that doesn't happen any more."
   Mrs.Cove told us that when men came 
 to work,they came for life.During the 
 war Mrs.Cove had six reliable{German  
{prisoners}working on the farm,of which
 one of them stayed to make his life   
 there.Mrs. Cove's regret is that      
 farming is like a factory now.
