		<title>11Public houses in Swindon.</title>
		<content> In Old Town there are many public     
 houses and clubs. People go there to  
 meet their friends and have a drink or
 a meal. The Pubs are the Royal Oak,   
 Bell, King's Arms, Plough, wheatsheaf,
 Fountain, Victoria, Cross-keys, Globe,
 and Prince of Wales.                  
 The Clubs are the Working Man's club, 
 Club 4, Liddington club.              
 Many of the Pubs were built over 100  
 years ago for travellers. They have   
 been modernised and are very popular  
 with local people.                    
 In New Swindon there are many more    
 pubs and clubs. The newest ones are in
 the Westward expansion and some of    
 these are most unusual,such as a      
 Spanish Hacienda, and a Village       
 complete with Blacksmith's            
 forge.
