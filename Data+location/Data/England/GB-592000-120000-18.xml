		<title>18Public Concern in Rye</title>
		<content>  There are several subjects which     
 cause cocern to the public of the     
 area. It is hoped that the station    
 site will be developed to include a   
 supermarket and a new car park, both  
 of which are badly needed. A bypass is
 desperately needed to keep the heavy  
 traffic out of the centre of Rye. The 
 Government has approved this in       
 outline, but the route has not yet    
 been decided. It is also hoped to     
 build a sports hall to be used by     
 Thomas Peacocke School and the general
 public.
