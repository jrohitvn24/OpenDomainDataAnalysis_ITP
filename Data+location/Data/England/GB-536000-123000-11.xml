		<content> The{Rock Lodge Vineyard}started       
 planting vines 21 yrs ago.It was one  
 of the first eight in this country.   
 They started by planting 50 different 
 types in small batches to see which   
 ones grew well in this country.The    
 best was a German type and a separate 
 one called Racansteiner.Each year the 
 Rock Lodge spreads a little more.     
 This Easter and last Easter they      
 planted more than usual.They always   
 like to have some competition.Many    
 people say that you can't grow a red  
 wine in England because of the lack of
 sun.It is the amount of hours the sun 
 shines that counts.The average yield  
 per acre is 3500 to 4000 bottles a    
 year.This is aproximately 1000 bottles
 every ton of grapes.Last year they    
 produced 16000 bottles-16 tons.
