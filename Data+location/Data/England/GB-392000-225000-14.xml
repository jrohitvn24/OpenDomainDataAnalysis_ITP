		<title>14A 435 : TRUNK ROAD</title>
		<content> The{A435 }is a busy trunk road        
 carrying a large amount of freight    
 from the {West Country} to the {      
{Midlands.}The road is very narrow at  
 the{Race Course} and in{Bishop's      
{Cleeve }there is a dangerous right    
 angled bend called{Gilders Corner,}   
 which is an accident black spot. Also 
 each day at 4.30pm the road becomes   
 congested by local commuters from     
 Smiths Industry at{Smiths Traffic     
{Lights.}A pedestrian crossing has     
 recently been installed.A Bypass was  
 suggested in 1926.By 1974 there were 3
 alternative routes;in 1984 a          
 popularity survey decided on Option D 
 which would pass to the west of{      
{Bishop's Cleeve. }This plan would mean
 that a thousand new homes might be    
 built on farming land between the     
 bypass and the village.
