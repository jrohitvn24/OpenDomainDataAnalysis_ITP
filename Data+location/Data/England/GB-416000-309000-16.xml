There are several footpaths in our     
block and we have made several trips to
walk them  and discover different kinds
of land they go through.One of the     
footpaths goes down by the Church and  
down to the river it is really         
lovely.Another goes right through the  
village by the Club and out into the   
main Burton Road.Another goes through  
farmland and we took extra care to make
sure the wheat wasn,t damaged and gates
closed.We are lucky to have such lovely
walks.
