		<content>   I am called Emma Louise Heesom and I
 live in St. Austell, Cornwall. My     
 house is white with a big front garden
 and a big back garden. There are four 
 people in my family.  I have one      
 sister called Nicola Jane Heesom. My  
 mum is called Maureen and my dad is   
 called Eric. My dad is the manager of 
 Polkyth Recreation Centre in          
 St.Austell and my mum works at the    
 Cottage Hospital in St. Austell.      
   I play made up games and I like     
 playing games on the Computer. I also 
 play board games. My hobbies are      
 "pesting" my sister and collecting    
 post cards.                           
   We go all over Cornwall for trips.  
 We go to Warrington to visit my       
 relatives. I have a grandma and two   
 grandads.
