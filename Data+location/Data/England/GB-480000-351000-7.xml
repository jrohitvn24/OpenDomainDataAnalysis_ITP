		<title>07THE LOCAL BIKE SHOP</title>
		<content>   Many local people rely on bikes for 
 their personal transport. There has   
 been a cycle repair shop at the end of
 Hawton Lane,Balderton for over 40     
 years. Mr.Jarman the present owner has
 been there 6 years. The shop is well  
 situated at the junction of 2 main    
 roads.                                
   Although he does sell new and second
 hand bikes the bulk of his work is    
 repairing,reconditioning and servicing
 cycles. The relatively new craze of   
 BMX riding did bring a slight increase
 in trade but the most popular bike is 
 the traditional model.                
   Having been in the two wheeled trade
 for over 20 years Mr. Jarman realised 
 his ambition to own a cycle shop and  
 was quite happy with his lot.
