		<content>A 10 YEAR OLD CHILDS VIEW OF LIFE IN   
EDINGALE IN 1985.                      
      I like living in Edingale because
it is quiet and peaceful. You can go   
for quiet walks and pick fruit from the
hedgerows. We can take our dog for a   
walk over the fields and this would be 
impossible in a city or big town.      
      There are fields with shire      
horses and cows and sheep. Sometimes we
go fishing and we can go to the brook  
and paddle or try to catch little fish 
with a fishing net. How could you go   
fishing in the city amongst all the    
roads and houses? There are nice       
country smells here and no big         
factories, and not much smoke.         
      In the city it is very noisy     
because lots of traffic goes by but in 
Edingale hardly any traffic comes.
