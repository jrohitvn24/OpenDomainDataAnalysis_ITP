		<content>      The major communication through  
 the area is the Warwick-Banbury Road, 
 the A425,linking with the A41(T) at   
 junction south of Park Farm.Leading   
 from this a new road,Europa Way has   
 been cut,with the purpose of joining  
 the{Heathcote Industrial Estate}to the
 main routes from Banbury,Coventry and 
 Birmingham.                           
      The{M40}from London to Oxford is 
 planned to be extended in the near    
 future and could affect the area as it
 would link with the{Sherbourne}end of 
 the{Warwick}by-pass.Already a section 
 of the A41(T) from Sherbourne to the  
 junction with the A425 has provision  
 for dual carriageway.There are also   
 strong interests pushing for the      
 canalisation of the Avon from         
 Stratford-Upon-Avon to Warwick where a
 link would be made with the Grand     
 Union Canal.                          </content>
