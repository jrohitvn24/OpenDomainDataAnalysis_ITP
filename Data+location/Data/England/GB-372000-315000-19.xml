		<title>19LILLESHALL-QUARRIES</title>
		<content> The{quarries and limestone mines}began
 in the late{1600's to mid 1700's}.The 
 mines were joined by a{canal}         
 commissioned by{Earl Gower(1st Marquis
{of Stafford 1786)}and built by{John   
 and{Thomas Gilbert}.It was the first  
 in{Shropshire}and branches of it      
 served the mines,taking limestone from
{Lilleshall to Lilleshall Company}.The 
 last underground working closed in    
 1882.The canal branches were abandoned
 in 1878-1879.The remains of the       
 quarries,mines and limekilns can be   
 seen to the East of Limekiln Lane     
 behind Barrack Lane.Some canal        
 branches and bridges can still be     
 traced including the{Incline Plain    
 which was built to move boats from one
 level to another.It is now a grassy   
 slope{near Hugh's Bridge.
