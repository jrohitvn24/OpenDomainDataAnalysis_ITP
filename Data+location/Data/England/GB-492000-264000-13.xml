By Debra Craig, aged 10.               
Mr Old told us that he had owned his   
farm since 1934. He owns 210 acres. 54 
acres are used for grazing, the rest   
for growing wheat and barley.We asked  
him Â£How much, would you pay per acre, 
if you were to buy that land today?'   
He said it would cost {2 000 pounds    
per acre.}He uses nitrogen fertilizer  
He sometimes gets pests on the crops   
so he sprays the crops.He uses special 
food for his animals.He keeps cows,    
sheep and chickens.{A normal wage for a
farm worker would be about 120 pounds a
week.} Mr Old keeps lots of farm       
machinery. They cost thousands of      
pounds.When the machinery breaks       
down he sometimes fixes the machines,  
but usually he gets the agricultural   
engineer in.
