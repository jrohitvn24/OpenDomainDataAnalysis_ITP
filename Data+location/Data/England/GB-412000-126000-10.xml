		<content>  The accomodation is for 64 old people
 given 1 room each of their own. They  
 can come and go. They are given three 
 meals a day. There is a large lounge  
 area with a television. There are 50  
 employees, mainly senior staff, but   
 some junior &amp; volunteers. There       
 are very few regulations for the      
 people or for visitors. The Â£7 pocket 
 money is either to save or to spend.  
 The old people mainly come from the   
 Salisbury area. They pay a minimum fee
 of Â£32 yearly &amp; a maximum of Â£100.    
 This depends on how much money they   
 have, or how wealthy their families   
 are. Some of the old people need      
 operations, in which case they go to  
 Newbridge hospital.
