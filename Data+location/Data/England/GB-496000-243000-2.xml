		<content> The area has undulating landscape     
 which rises from the Oxford Clay vale 
 to the south to a ridge of boulder    
 clay in the west.The ridge has a      
 plateau- like top (on part of which   
 is the Cranfield airfield to the south
 -west out of this area ) and although 
 there is more arable farming here now 
 that in the past the area still       
 retains much pastoral farming and     
 there is more tree and hedgerow cover 
 than in surrounding areas. The area is
 therefore, less open, but fine views  
 can be gained from the ridge at Bourne
 End, looking in a north -easterly     
 direction across to the Bedford urban 
 area and beyond.There is some         
 woodland,Wootton Woods and Longcroft  
 Spinney which are part of a line of   
 ancient oak and ash woods in this     
 area.
