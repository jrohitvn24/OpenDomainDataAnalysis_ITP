		<content> Most of the boys in our school play   
 football in their spare time.There is 
 small football pitch at school and  in
 the village there is a playing field  
 with a big football pitch there.The   
 second favourite things were riding   
 your bike and playing with your       
 friends and they're not even half as  
 popular as football was.When I say    
 playing with my friends I mean just   
 going over to their house and making  
 games up to play or just sitting about
 talking.Riding your bike is both going
 on scramble tracks with your BMX      
 (sports bike with toughened wheels    
 etc) or just normaly riding           
 about.Nearly as many people like      
 watching television in their spare    
 time as riding your bike and playing  
 with your friends.I would have thought
 that television would be the most     
 popular.                              </content>
