 Middle School in Settle at 10+. Most  
 of them come from the Rathmell parish 
 but a considerable proportion come    
 from the neighbouring village of      
 Wigglesworth. There are{two classes   
 each with its own teacher (one of whom
 is the headteacher) helped by a part- 
 timer and a non-teaching assistant.

 a friendly, workmanlike atmosphere    
 encourages the children to develop    
 their personality and potential.      </content>
