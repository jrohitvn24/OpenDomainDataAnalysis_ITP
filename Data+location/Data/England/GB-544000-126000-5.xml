		<title>05SUMMERFORD, FAIRWARP</title>
		<content> In June several people from my class  
 went to meet an artist. He draws and  
 paints the wild life of Ashdown       
 forest. Our headmistress took us to   
 see him. We asked him a few questions.
 He told us that he usually did a      
 sketch using quite a few chalks. For  
 some paintings it would take him about
 six hours including the sketch. He    
 paints it in either oils or water     
 colours. His house is called          
 Summerford because there is a splash  
 and one can only go through it in     
 summer. At other times it is too deep.
 The Forestry commission looks after   
 Furnace Wood. Its name reminds us of  
 the iron works at Oldlands and the    
 need for fuel for the furnaces. The   
 wood is mixed. We saw oak, birch,     
 willow and spruce. There were many    
 plants, honeysuckle and brambles. A   
 river runs past the Witch's stone.    </content>
