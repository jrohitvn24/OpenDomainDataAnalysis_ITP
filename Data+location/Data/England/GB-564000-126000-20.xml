		<title>20Stonegate's changing face</title>
		<content> In 1985 many changes are taking place 
 in Stonegate.Owing to increased       
 mechanisation,fewer people are        
 employed on the farms.Farm workers    
 have had to seek alternative          
 employment,often away from the        
 village.Their places have been taken  
 in the village by commuters,who rely  
 on train services or private cars to  
 take them to work in London or other  
 towns.Many farm buildings,especially  
 oast houses and barns,have been       
 redeveloped as dwellings.             
 The railway has relied upon diesel-   
 powered locomotives for many years,but
 in 1985 preparations are being made   
 for the electrification of the line.
