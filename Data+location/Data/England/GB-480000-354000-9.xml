		<title>09BRITISH GYPSUM-INDUSTRY</title>
		<content>   On Beacon Hill there is a{gypsum}   
 works owned by British Gypsum. Gypsum 
 was formed under the sea, it can be   
 white or pink. At Beacon Hill it was  
 quarried between the early 1800's and 
 1936. The site is 100 acres in size.  
 Today most of the {quarries}have been 
 filled in and the land is farmed. The 
 old quarries are also used as rifle   
 ranges and rubbish tips.              
   Today white gypsum from the quarries
 at Hawton is processed. It is taken by
 lorry to the Beacon Hill site where it
 is crushed, ground, heated and made   
 into {plaster}. 80 men are employed   
 there now. The plant works night and  
 day. The plaster is used in the       
 medical profession for making plaster 
 bandages, and in the pottery industry 
 where it is used to make plaster casts
 and models.
