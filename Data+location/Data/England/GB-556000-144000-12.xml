		<content> There are lots of different schools in
 Tonbridge,{primary, secondary}and     
{private.}There is one{Roman Catholic  
 school.In Tonbridge we start school at
 five, with the exception of some      
 private schools.At the age of eleven  
 we have some{selection tests.}If you  
 get a selective place you can go to a 
{Grammar school.}If not, you go to a   
{Secondary Modern.}In a primary school 
 the main subjects are Maths and       
 English.There is a new system coming  
 up in 1987 called the 16+.This will be
 instead of'O'levels.There ought to be 
 more facilities in the schools, for   
 leisure and technical things like     
{computers.}Without education the world
 would be very primitive because no one
 would know how to work technical      
 things.
