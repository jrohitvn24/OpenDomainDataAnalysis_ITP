 lived here for over 25 years.         
                                       
   {Many new estates have been built   
{during the 25 years.}                 
                                       
    We found that few people were born 
 in the villages of{BOMERE HEATH,      
{LEATON,}or{MERRINGTON.}Only 6 people  
 had always lived in that area. 122 had
 moved in from elsewhere. Some had come
 from other parts of Shropshire, many  
 have come from other parts of the     
 British Isles. e.g.{BIRMINGHAM,       
{MANCHESTER, GUILFORD,}&amp;{ANGLESEY.}    
                                       
    One or two had come from abroad    
 e.g.{NEW ZEALAND, IRAN, AUSTRALIA,HONG
{KONG, WEST GERMANY.}
