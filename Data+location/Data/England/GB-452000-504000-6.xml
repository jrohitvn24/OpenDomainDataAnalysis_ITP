		<title>06Moving into Great Broughton</title>
		<content>  When my husband came home one evening
 in April and told me we were moving to
 Wilton on Teeside, all sorts of things
 immediately sprang to mind, for       
 instance, where would we live. However
 that decision was soon made for me as 
 we drove through the village of Gt    
 Broughton.                            
           We had come from a village  
 just outside Harrogate and found that 
 very picturesque but nothing to equal 
 where we now live. The hills on a     
 clear day as I wait for the children  
 from school will always be something I
 will appreciate. As a newcomer I felt 
 very apprehensive but again I need not
 have worried.                         
              Everyone has been        
 friendly and helpful, and as an       
 anxious mum I wondered how the        
 children would settle, but they too   
 have quickly made new friends.        </content>
