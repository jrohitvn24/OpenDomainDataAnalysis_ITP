		<title>19POLICE</title>
		<content> The distrct is policed by 'panda'     
 patrol vehicles which travel out from 
 the main centres.  There is no longer 
 a local, village 'Bobby' but special  
 constables are appointed who are      
 people with a local knowledge of the  
 area and who generally have other jobs
 during the normal working day.        
   Since the area is not heavily       
 populated and there are only a few    
 small, often isolated communities, the
 incidence of major crime is not all   
 that great.                           
   As is the case with other areas of  
 the country, there is a police officer
 who has the special task of liaising  
 with the school.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
