		<title>07THE OXFORD MEADS</title>
		<content>  Oxey Mead and Pixey Mead have been   
 designated sites of special scientific
 interest because they are water       
 meadows which have never been         
 ploughed.As a result of this there are
 over thirty rare species of flowers   
 including early purple orchid, adder's
 tongue fern, meadow buttercup and a   
 late flowering dandelion found nowhere
 else.Hay is gathered annually in early
 July to allow the rare plants to seed.
  The names derive from ancient Saxon  
 times.Pic and Oc were farmers who     
 owned these two islands,island being  
 "ey" in Saxon.
