		<title>20Morganite Crucible, Norton</title>
		<content>   Across a field, adjacent to the     
 works, there lies Norton Hall now     
 under restoration. This was purchased 
 along with the factory but was later  
 sold. Morganite is a Private Limited  
 Company which imports all its Granite 
 from Madagasca. It is then processed  
 by the central manufacturing building.
 By the side of this building there are
 warehouses, an executive building, a  
 canteen and recreation areas for the  
 workers.                              
   Morganite Crucible is not a noisy,  
 polluting industrial site, despite the
 huge chimney. It provides valuable    
 employment locally and helps to       
 maintain the polulation in a rural    
 area where most jobs are in           
 agriculture and where people are      
 leaving the land.
