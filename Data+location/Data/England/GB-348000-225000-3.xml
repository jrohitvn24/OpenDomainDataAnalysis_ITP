		<content>  Birds - Migrants &amp; Nesting           
      By April 3, chiffchaffs and      
 willow warblers arrived, the former   
 not remaining.  Fewer willow warblers 
 raised young.  House martins did not  
 use all original nest-sites but some  
 raised  second broods after failure of
 the first.                            
      By April 25, blackcaps,          
 whitethroat, cuckoo, yellow wagtails  
 and spotted flycatchers had returned  
 and winter flocks of linnets, green   
 and goldfinches and skylarks had      
 separated to breed.                   
      The cold spring and wet early    
 summer continued tp affect migrants   
 adversely.  A  wood warbler survey    
 from May l5 to June lO in local woods 
 gave negative results although other  
 warblers were seen.                   
      By June 2 more swifts than usual 
 arrived but did not nest.             </content>
