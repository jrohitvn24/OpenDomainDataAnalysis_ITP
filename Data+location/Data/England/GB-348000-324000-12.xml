		<title>12A Day in the Holidays.</title>
		<content> In the holidays, I wake up at about   
 7.30am. I get up and go downstairs and
 eat my breakfast consisting of muesli 
 and coffee. I get dressed and tidy the
 house perhaps polishing, hoovering or 
 washing the floor. While I tidy up I  
 listen to the radio and sometimes I   
 answer the phone. At about 12 o/clock 
 my father comes home from work and I  
 make him a cup of coffee and some     
 sandwiches. When my mother returns    
 from work at about 1 pm, I sometimes  
 go up Grinshill with my friend Denise.
 We play hide and seek in the woods and
 in the bracken. Sometimes we have     
 sandwiches for tea on the hill,       
 othertimes we have a cooked meal at   
 home. Later on I watch some television
 and go to bed at about 10pm.
