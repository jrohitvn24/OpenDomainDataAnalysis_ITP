		<content>    The M62 Motorway has played a vital
 role in the economic growth of        
 Rochdale. There  are three access     
 points within the municipal borough.  
 The highway is a vital link for       
 Rochdale with the North West as well  
 as being an important Transpennine    
 Route. It is also well-used by        
 commuters travelling easily to        
 Manchester or Leeds. We undertook a   
 survey in Balderstone Community School
 and found that 48  % of pupils'       
 parents used the M62 regularly.       
   Rochdale has a good rail service and
 is a major station on the Manchester  
 to Leeds line.Trains operate,in both  
 directions,approx.every 30 minutes,at 
 peak times.
