		<title>18EMPLOYMENT AND INDUSTRY</title>
		<content> As stated previously the majority of  
 people commute daily to their place of
 work, either to the outlying districts
 as part of the service infra-structure
 associated with local hospitals,      
 schools, shops, etc., or alternatively
 travelling further afield to the      
 commercial and industrial sectors of  
 Hinckley, Nuneaton or Leicester.      
 Employment is however available within
 the area with farming as undoubtedly  
 the major source.                     
                                       
 Industrial sites within the area      
 include Naneby Hall Quarry, which     
 employs ten people and is currently   
 operated as a screening plant for     
 processing sand and gravel, an        
 adjacent concern involved in the      
 production of ready mixed concrete and
 finally, a small company making low   
 volume pre cast concrete products.    </content>
