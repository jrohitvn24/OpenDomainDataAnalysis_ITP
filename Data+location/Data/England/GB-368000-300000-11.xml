		<title>11Morris dancing team</title>
		<content>    Our team consists of eight girls   
 and three musicians on drums and      
 tambours. The dances are easy to pick 
 up so anyone  can learn. We do swings,
 back to backs,hays, stick clashes,    
 stars and some other complicated      
 steps. we are learning a new dance to 
 the tune of 'House of Dinah',which was
 collected by Cecil Sharpe in Broseley 
 in the early years of the century. We 
 know three other dances called        
 'Woodhouse Bog''Wenlock' and'Benthall'
 (the last two are local places).We    
 have danced at local fetes, a music   
 festival and at another school, they  
 gave us Â£5 for school funds. We       
 practise at lunchtime at school,      
 sometimes in the school hall,         
 sometimes on the field.
