		<content> We asked Mr. Taylor some questions    
 about the {Clock Tower}and he said he 
 would take us up. I had to climb up a 
 stepladder and pull myself through a  
 trapdoor. Inside there were two       
 weights used for winding purposes. The
 room was square. Some bars came out of
 the wall in a triangle, I climbed them
 and reached another floor. Mr. Taylor 
 closed the trapdoor. Inside was the   
 clock. Mr. Taylor wound up the clock. 
 Warboys {Clock Tower }is in the       
 middle of a junction on each side     
 there is a plaque. All the plaques are

 clover, on the south face is a flower,
 on the west face is an R, on top of a 
 V and on the east face is a thistle.  
 It has had to have a new clock face on
 it because vandals threw stones at it.
 It was built in {1888}. The actual    
 clock was made by {Gillet and Co..    </content>
