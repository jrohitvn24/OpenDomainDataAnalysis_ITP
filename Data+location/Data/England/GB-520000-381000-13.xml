		<content>  A DAY IN MY LIFE.(11Yr old girl)     
   My name is Kate and I am eleven     
 years old.I have three ponies called  
 Jenny,Gamecock and Smokey.            
   When I woke up on Sunday the 30th of
 June I dressed in my riding           
 clothes.When I went downstairs mum was
 cooking breakfast.For breakfast I had 
 bacon,sausage and egg.When I had eaten
 my breakfast I went down the yard and 
 groomed my pony.I put leg bandages and
 a tail bandage on her.I went back to  
 the house and had a wash.We then set  
 off to Spilsby Show at about          
 9 o'clock.                            
   A show is an event where you have   
 show-jumping and showing.Showing is   
 where a judge decides whose pony is   
 the best.
