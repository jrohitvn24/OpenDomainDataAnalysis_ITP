		<title>10Boughton's Carnival</title>
		<content>   Due to Boughton's position on the   
 busy A2 road, the village was never   
 able to get together for any real     
 major annual event. After much        
 petitioning and protesting Boughton   
 finally got a much needed by-pass in  
 May 1976.                             
   Since that date, the people of the  
 village have taken the opportunity to 
 celebrate this freedom of The Street  
 by holding a carnival along the once  
 busy road.                            
   It takes the form of a procession   
 from the bottom of Boughton Hill to   
 the village hall and playing fields at
 the opposite end of the village,where 
 a party continues through the         
 afternoon.People dress up in fancy-   
 dress,march as majorettes,play music  
 in a band or go on a float.In the     
 field they play games, eat food and go
 on rides and side-shows.              </content>
