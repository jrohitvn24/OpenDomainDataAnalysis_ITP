		<content> In 1984, at the Parish Assembly, a    
 committee was appointed to consider   
 village needs in the year {2000}.     
 Elected were{Philip Emerton}as        
 chairman,{Keith Hurley} as secretary, 
 and five other members.               
                                       
 The committee talked to people from   
 the Parish, District and County       
 Councils , the Vicar and headmaster of
 the senior school. They contacted     
 sports clubs and examined amenities   
 controlled by the Church and Council. 
 Information was taken from the 1981   
 census and a survey of residents.     
                                       
 The committee reported that most      
 people want the village to remain much
 as it is now, and they recommended    
 that any additional sports facilities 
 should be funded by the users.
