		<content> FLECKNEY FUN RUN                      
 Every year during July or August my   
 mum helps to organise a fun run. It is
 a hot and tiring race but people like 
 me just run for the fun and don't take
 it seriously.It is 50p for children,  
 50p for O.A.P.'s and Â£1.00 for adults 
 to enter. One year someone even       
 entered a dog for Â£1.00.              
 FLECKNEY PRAM RACE                    
 Every year the men of the village     
 dress up as babies and mothers for the
 Fleckney Pram Race. The idea if the   
 game is that they push a pram round   
 the village and drink glasses of beer.
