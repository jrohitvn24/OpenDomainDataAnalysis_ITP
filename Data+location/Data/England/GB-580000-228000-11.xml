		<content>{Halstead Swimming Club}trains on      
 Monday,Tuesday,Wednesday and Friday   
 nights and Saturday mornings. On the  
 training nights you swim 30 lengths to
 warm up,then training starts. The pool
 is not very long or wide and there is 
 not much shallow end for small        
 children to learn how to swim. At the 
 end of the training sessions we have  
 relays. The senior A is the best      
 group. Junior A is the next best and B
 is the third and C is the worst. The  
 galas are always on Saturdays. Every  
 sixty days we have time trials. That  
 means we swim a length and see if our 
 times are quicker than before. You    
 could get a medal for improving the   
 most. There is a medal for each group.
 If you want to get a sprint award you 
 have to get a certain time. To join   
 the club you go for a trial on the    
 first Friday of the month.            </content>
