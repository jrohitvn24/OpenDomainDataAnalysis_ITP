		<title>04The Old Town, Bexhill</title>
		<content> Bexhill is mainly a modern town,      
 although the earliest reference to    
 Bexhill is in the{Doomsday Book.}It   
 refers to it as the{Paramount Manor of
{Bexelei.}It is thought that the name  
 comes from the Saxon name beck which  
 means a brook or stream. Bexhill Old  
 Town is on a slight hill and there are
 a number of old buildings standing    
 including the Church (St. Peters), the
 Manor House and a number of shops and 
 houses. On one of the buildings       
 there is an old clock which was       
 purchased by a public collection to   
 mark Queen Victoria's jubilee in 1887.
 It has Roman numbers round the outside
 and in the middle of the face it has  
 1887 and V.R. which stands for        
 Victoria Regina.
