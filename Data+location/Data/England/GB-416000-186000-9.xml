		<title>09WHY HONDA CHOSE SWINDON (2)</title>
		<content>{3.}The Austin Rover car body plant    
 could supply panels direct to South   
 Marston if full-scale car assembly    
 goes ahead.                           
{4.}The engineering skills of the      
 Swindon workforce and the town's      
 reputation for rapid industrial growth
 helped sway Honda's decision.         
{5.}Swindon has good motorway links    
 with London, especially Heathrow      
 Airport which can be reached in an    
 hour via the M4 motorway.             
                                       
 A new four-way junction will be built 
 on the A419 road to ease the flow of  
 70 heavy lorries using the site daily.
 Landscaping of the site is being      
 carried out to minimise the           
 environmental nuisance to local       
 residents. Our area will be greatly   
 affected: more jobs, more money, more 
 traffic, less open countryside.       </content>
