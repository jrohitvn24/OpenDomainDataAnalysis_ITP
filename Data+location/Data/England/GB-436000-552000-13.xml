		<content>  During the two{World Wars}the house  
 was commissioned by the army and used 
 as a headquarters for offices.        
  After the last war the house was     
 bought by the{Seaman's Orphanage.}Then
 the Welfare Department bought the     
 house and it was used for many years  
 as a home for ladies who have spent a 
 long time in{hospital.}For the last   
 seven years the house has been used   
 for training people of all ages to be 
 able to live in the community after   
 having an illness. The house has been 
 altered only on the inside, as it had 
 to be adapted for the various uses it 
 has been put to. We believe that      
{Moorhill}got it's name from the{Town  
{Moor}and{Tunstall Hills}which it      
 stands between. At the bottom of the  
 garden where the greenhouse stood, we 
 found a{wine bottle.
