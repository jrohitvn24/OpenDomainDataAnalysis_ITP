		<content> In our area there are three new       
 churches.The oldest of these three    
 churches is North Springfield Baptist 
 Church which was opened in Jan 1984 by
 the president of the Baptist Churches 
 in England.Besides the church services
 they run youth groups,Boys and Girls  
 Brigade and Playgroups.The 2nd church 
 is St Augustines.It is an             
 interdenominational church used by the
 Roman Catholics, Church of England and
 Methodists.It was consecrated in June 
 1984.The church is also used as a     
 hall.St Augustines is very plain and  
 does not really look like a church.   
 Since the first houses were built 8   
 years ago{Chelmer Village}has not had 
 a church.In 1982 the first plans  for 
 a new church built on land given by a 
 local farmer were made.{The Church of 
{Our Saviour}will be dedicated on{19th 
{July,1985.                            </content>
