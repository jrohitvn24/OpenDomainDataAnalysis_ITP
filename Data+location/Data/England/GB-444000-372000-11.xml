		<title>11Health In The Area.</title>
		<content>     In our area there are no doctors, 
 dentists, or opticians, they are all  
 just outside the area. {There is one  
{school nurse called Mrs Reynolds.} On 
 average each school is visited once a 
 month by her.  We asked her opinion on
 local health.                         
   The houses are quite clean, but the 
 roads and streets have quite a lot of 
 litter. {The care for the old is quite
{good.} In Poolsbrook they have        
 bungalows for the old.  Health        
 visitors, district nurses, and        
 chiropodists go to the houses.        
   The most common{illness}for children
 is a cold. {Illnesses}like lung       
 problems and bad backs are caused by  
 working down the mines.  We asked if  
 there were any drug addicts the       
 answer was "There must be"!.
