		<content>  The great majority of people in the  
 area who were interviewed use the     
 nearest large supermarket-Tesco's -in 
 Flitwick which is about 2 miles away  
 for the bulk of their shopping.       
  Only one person asked used mainly the
 village shop.A few people use shops in
 Ampthill, Milton Keynes,Luton and     
 Bedford.                              
  Everyone has to travel by private    
 means to do their shopping as there is
 no way to reach shops and return by   
 public transport.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
