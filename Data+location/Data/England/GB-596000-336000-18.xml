		<content>   At one time the village was keenly  
 interested in national and local      
 politics. The farmers and landowners  
 were members of the local Conservative
 group and the farm labourers were     
 mostly Labour supporters.             
  Feelings ran high at election        
 meetings, candidates spoke to the     
 electorate in the village school.     
 Labour held a strong numerical        
 advantage. Today the position is      
 reversed. Many of the new residents   
 are Conservatives, the farm men have  
 long gone.                            
  Political interest seems to have been
 dissipated and there is no real       
 excitement in the village today at    
 election times. Probably television   
 decides the issues, rather than local 
 meetings.
