		<content>{Mr Hooper}a land owner in {COLD NORTON
  and also one of our school Governors,
 told us that most of the farmland in {
 and around COLD NORTON is used for    
 growing cereals including oil seed    
 rape and lucerne . Lucerne is mostly  
 sent to Asheldham and turned into     
 cubes which are used to feed all sorts
 of animals mainly cows and pigs.The   
 other crops we have around {COLD      
{NORTON}are barley,wheat, oats,and     
 peas.Very few people in {COLD         
{NORTON}own  farm animals as far as    
 we know although Mr Hooper has a beef 
 cattle herd and Great Hayes is the    
 only one with a dairy herd of two     
 hundred.
