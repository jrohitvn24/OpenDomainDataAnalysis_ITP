		<title>15GAMEKEEPING AT BLACKDOWN</title>
		<content>    At Blackdown there is a keeper     
 called Sidney Fidler. He keeps three  
 pens full of pheasants. The pens are  
 sited in the shade of trees.          
    He keeps the pheasants' feed in a  
 big tin drum so that rats and mice    
 cannot eat it. He puts water in       
 plastic drums which he has sawn in    
 half. He feeds the birds every morning
 and every evening.                    
    The young birds which are delivered
 to him to rear are called poults. They
 eat chick crumbs at first and then,   
 when they are older, they eat barley, 
 corn, wheat and other crops.          
    When the pheasants are fully grown 
 they are let out of the pen; if not   
 they just fly over the fence! The     
 adult males will mate with about six  
 females and produce more chicks.      
    Pheasants are shot for sport and   
 for consumption.                      </content>
