		<title>07THE STRUCTURE OF HOUSES</title>
		<content> Houses built in the 60's and          
 70's,i.e.Forestdale, are considerably 
 smaller than those in Addington       
 village.The building land is so scarce
 now that developers want to build as  
 many dwellings as possible in the     
 space available.This has led to the   
 building of many flats,(i.e.Pennycroft
 on Forestdale),maisonettes and        
 terraced houses in the newer parts of 
 the area.                             
   But methods of building have changed
 timber and reinforced concrete are    
 used much more widely in the          
 construction of modern homes on the   
 New Addington and Forestdale estates, 
 these ways of building now allow      
 larger areas of glass,therefore making
 the buildings much lighter inside.    
   Some good examples of these modern  
 methods of building can be found on   
 Forestdale and New Addington.         </content>
