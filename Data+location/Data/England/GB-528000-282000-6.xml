		<title>06ECOLOGY OF BURY AREA</title>
		<content> The wildlife in this area is mainly in
 old,well established gardens.This is  
 because the fens around here are very 
 flat and monotonous,and don't have the
 dykes,hedges and trees wildlife depend
 on.Housing developement hasn't really 
 affected the wildlife,but chemicals   
 and modern crop growing methods have. 
 Wistow Wood isn't part of the National
 Trust,but is looked after by the Hunts
 and Beds naturalists trust.It's mainly
 an oak ash establishment,and has been 
 planted up over several hundred years.
 Just off from Shillow Hill is a big   
 house set in tall trees.In this a     
 large rookery has been built up.Also  
 the pond boasts one of the largest    
 populations of the fairly rare        
 Great-Crested Newt.
