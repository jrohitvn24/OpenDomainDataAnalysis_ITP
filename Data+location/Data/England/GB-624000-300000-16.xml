		<title>16Poringland Conservation</title>
		<content> We were looking at conservation in    
 Poringland and tried to follow some   
 footpaths.The first 1 was over grown  
 and was to difficult to pass.We found 
 another footpath but there was a      
 Barley field in front of us.The 3rd   
 footpath was also impassable because  
 of a Barley field.We asked a couple of
 local people in the village if they   
 ever used the footpaths.1 woman did   
 not even know they excisted and the   
 others never used them.
