		<content>Some {plants} are  wild.   We can  find
nettles,  daisies,  dandelions,  grass,
wild flowers and hedges.   Some {trees}
are wild.                              
We often think wild plants are weeds so
we kill them.    Wildlife grows in  our
back gardens, front gardens, along  the
sides of roads and fields, by trees, by
rivers,  fences, gateways  and   beside
walls.    We also  find moss growing on
roofs.   We have indoor plants like the
cactus and rubber plants.              
Our  outdoor  plants   are  sunflowers,
dafodils, poppys,  sweet  williams  and
snap dragons.                          
{Pets and wild animals}        At  home
we have;  1 hamster, 3 rabbit,  4 cats,
10 dogs,  2 ducks, 12  fish,  14 birds,
5 snails and 9 frogs.    We  have  some
wild   pheasants,  foxes,  rabbits  and
hares.
