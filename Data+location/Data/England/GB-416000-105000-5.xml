		<content>   Once a fortnight on a Saturday      
 morning at 11 a.m. we drive up to{    
{Hangersley}for a riding leson. We ride
 Pickles and Ajax. Pickles is a{grey   
{Welsh Mountain pony}and Ajax is a{    
{brown and white cob.}                 
   Sometimes we ride through{Linford}  
 and have a good canter up the hiils   
 and through the woods.                
   When we get back we help Mrs.       
 Morson, the owner, clean the tack and 
 muck out the stables. If we are lucky 
 we are able to help the toddlers with 
 their ponies.                         
   For riding we wear{jodhpurs}on our  
 legs which prevent us being caught up 
 in the saddle and being dragged if we 
 fall. We wear a{hard hat}to protect   
 our head. On our feet we wear long,   
 black, rubber{riding boots.}Our hair  
 is usually in plaits or pony tails or 
 really neat in a net.                 </content>
