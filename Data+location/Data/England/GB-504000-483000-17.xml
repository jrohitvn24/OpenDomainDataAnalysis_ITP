		<title>17CAYTON HOME LIFE SURVEY (1)</title>
		<content> We gave parents a questionnaire about 
 home and leisure. The results are :   
 Mr and Mrs "Average Cayton" are aged  
 between 30 and 40 with Mr Cayton 1 to 
 5 years older than his wife.They own  
 their own home. He is either a skilled
 worker or professional. She looks     
 after the home. He spends his spare   
 time taking part in sports or games,  
 do it yourself, watching T.V. or      
 gardening. She reads, watches T.V. or 
 gardens. She is only slightly less    
 likely to smoke than he is and has a 1
 in 3 chance of doing so.They are more 
 likely to holiday in Britain but the  
 holiday abroad is nearly as popular.  
 They have 2 children and use the      
 countryside around for leisure a lot. 
 Mostly they use supermarkets to shop. 
 They eat mainly home cooking rather   
 than convenience foods and are as     
 likely to drink either tea or coffee. </content>
