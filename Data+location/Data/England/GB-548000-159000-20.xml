		<title>20A Motorway Poem.</title>
		<content>{The lead man is shouting instruction  
{The men are all making destruction    
{The digger looks like a caterpillar   
{And the road looks like a river.      
 The M25 is always alive               
 With loads of disruptive machines     
 Munching,crunching;its so disrupting{ 
 They look like a bunch of old fiends. 
{I hate the muck from the dumper truck 
{I really don't like it at all         
{The noise it makes is a big disgrace  
{It could be our downfall.             
 You can hear hammering and chattering 
 Even when the day is done             
 I hear their shouts and have my doubts
 I reckon they made it for fun!

{The M25 is being constructed through  
{the Shoreham valley despite protests. 
{It is part of the London Orbital Road.</content>
