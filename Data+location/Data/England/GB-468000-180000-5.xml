		<title>05SONNING COMMON SCHOOL</title>
		<content>Sonning Common Primary School was built
in two sections the old and the new.   
The old section was built in 1913 and  
holds four classes and the new section 
built in 1969 also holds four classes. 
There is one more building that holds  
one class and the staffroom.           
There is a school for handicapped      
children near, and three classes of    
them are now part of our school. We    
also have a playgroup here.            
The games we play on our field are:    
Football,Rugby,Cricket,Hockey and      
rounders.We also have netball which is 
played on the playground.              
There is a swimming pool for the       
juniors and top infants to use,and a   
school aviary with some finches in it. 
The two halls are used for different   
things,one we use for music,and the    
other for P.E.,assembly and dinners.
