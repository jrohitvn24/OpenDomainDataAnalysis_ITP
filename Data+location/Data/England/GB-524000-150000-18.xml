		<content>   {Gatton Park}includes 230 acres of  
 mixed farmland where cows, horses and 
 sheep graze. It also includes an 18th.
 century, man-made lake and grounds    
 landscaped by Capability Brown.       
                                       
    Gatton Manor was mentioned in the  
{Domesday Survey of 1086}as Gatetune,  
 and was held by a Saxon earl called   
 Leofwin.  It was passed to the Norman 
 Bishop Odo, half brother to William   
 the Conqueror, and then later to the  
 crown. Ann of Cleaves held the manor  
 after her divorce from Henry VIII.    
                                       
    In the grounds is the 12th century 
{church of St.Andrews}which is still   
 used as a parish church. It has many  
 treasures including the only Flemish  
 prayer wood carving in the whole of   
 England.                              
                                       </content>
