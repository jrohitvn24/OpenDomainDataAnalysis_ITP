		<title>20Trentham - Housing Survey</title>
		<content>This survey was conducted within the   
one kilometre square in which the      
Priory C.E.(C) Junior School is        
located.                               
  This is a residential area comprising
some 850 owner occupied homes. There   
are approximately 200 detached houses, 
400 semi-detached houses, 100 detached 
bungalows, 84 semi-detached bungalows  
and a few terraced houses, cottages and
flats. About half of these homes have  
been built since 1950. A few pre-1900  
cottages exist that were part of the   
Duke of Sutherland's estate, namely    
those in Park Drive, where there is    
some dereliction. The                  
Dairyfields, especially Park Way is an 
area of large detached houses. There   
are no bungalows or shops on the       
Dairyfields. The children have quite   
a long walk to school and have to cross
the busy main road (A 34).             </content>
