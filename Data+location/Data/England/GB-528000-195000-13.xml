		<content> The Enfield Health Authority is       
 planning to up-date its hospital      
 services. To do this it will be       
 fulfilling a new, ambitious plan. The 
 hospital is to cost about twenty      
 million pounds. It will come into     
 service in the 1990's and will be     
 called Enfield District Hospital. This
 will have many advantages. There will 
 be more modern equiptment, more staff 
 and better conditions for patients and
 staff.                                
   Highlands Hospital will be sold and 
 the money will go towards funding the 
 new Hospital. The older buildings will
 be demolished at Chase Farm Hospital  
 to make room for new buildings. At    
 Highlands Hospital the views of the   
 staff are all nearly the same. Most   
 people who work at Highlands say that 
 it is quite a good idea to have the   
 new Hospital.                         </content>
