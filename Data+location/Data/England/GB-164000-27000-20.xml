		<title>20HELSTON FIRE STATION</title>
		<content> On Monday 1st July Class Two visited  
 the Fire Station. The station officer 
 told us how the firemen save people   
 from fires.Afterwards we went outside 
 and climbed on one of the ladders and 
 sat in a fire engine and a jeep. We   
 were shown four different kinds of    
 helmets worn by firemen and two       
 firemen showed us their special       
 uniform. A helmet with a diamond on   
 the side means that the man wearing it
 is allowed to wear breathing          
 apparatus.                            
      There are fourteen men in the    
 Brigade at the station and they meet  
 every Monday night for practice.      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
