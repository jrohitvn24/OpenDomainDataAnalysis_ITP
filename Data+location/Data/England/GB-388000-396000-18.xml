		<title>18Pocket money</title>
		<content> Out of 102 children at a local primary
 school aged 5 to 11 years the largest 
 amount of pocket money recieved is    
 Â£12.50. The smallest amount recieved  
 is 2p. The most common amount is      
 Â£1.00. 28 out of the 102 save their   
 pocket money, 26 children spend it on 
 sweets, and 8 spend it on toys; the   
 remainder spend it on a variety of    
 items depending on their feelings and 
 needs. With Â£1.00 a child could buy a 
 packet of crisps for 12p, a bar of    
 chocolate for 50p, a comic for 20p and
 a newspaper for 18p.                  
 If a child's mother gives a child     
 Â£5.00 or more, she usually gives it to
 them @ Â£1.00 a day. The average amount
 of pocket money  for the 102 children 
 was less than Â£1.00 per day.
