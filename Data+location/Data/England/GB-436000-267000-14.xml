		<title>14WESTON HOSPITAL (CONT.)</title>
		<content>     {INDUSTRIAL THERAPY.}Some of the  
 patients spend part of the day doing a
 simple job for which they are         
 paid.Packing hair rollers into plastic
 bags is a common example.At other     
 times they may be engaged in {        
{occupational therapy }or hobbies.     
      Patients are taken on regular    
{holidays}to the seaside.Last year a   
 group was taken to {Belgium.          
      Each patient receives either a   
{pension} or a {mobility allowance}    
 which he or she may spend in any way. 
      The hospital administrator is    
 hoping to install a computer to help  
 him keep track of each patient's      
 money.                                
      The hospital is fairly isolated  
 from the village of Weston Under      
 Wetherley,but local people are        
 encouraged to visit.
