<title>24Houses</title> 
<content>Out of the 34 people interviewed there were quite a few types of house, these include semi-detached, terrace and bungalow. 18 people had semi-detached, 11 had detached houses, and 5 had terrace. Out of these people, 2 had bungalows and 1 had a chalet.<br /><br />All the houses out of 34 where built out of brick or stone. No houses are made of wood because they would get mouldy in the rain. We think because of global warming there might soon be wooden houses in Timsbury. Most roofs in Timsbury are triangular and made from slate tiles so the rain would slide down through the drain pipe and into the drain.<br /><br />In Timsbury the fuels that are used are gas, electricity, oil and wood or coal fires. There were twenty-six houses that used gas; 22 people used electricity. Down in Timsbury only three people use oil and only three people use wood and coal fires.<br /><br />Out of the 34, only 14 have extended their house and 20 people haven't. <br /> Ben, Della and Ethan.</content>
