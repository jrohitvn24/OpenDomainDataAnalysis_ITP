		<content>{THE VILLAGE }                         
 The village is small and consists     
 mainly of houses on the main A.41 road
 and up Bourne End Lane culminating in 
 a small industrial area.There are two 
 pubs,a cafe and hotel on the main road
 and another pub by the canal.There are
 no shops,schools,health facilities etc
{A YOUNG MOTHER}                       
 This lady has two young children under
 school age.She is very concerned that 
 there is no local primary school      
 because children either have to be    
 taken by car or walk down a narrow    
 busy lane.                            
 There is nowhere for the children to  
 play.They can be taken for walks along
 the canal but this is a dangerous area
 for youngsters.                       
 It is difficult to walk along the A.41
 with lorries thundering past.She looks
 forward to the by pass being built.   </content>
