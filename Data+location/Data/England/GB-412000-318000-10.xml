		<content> A playgoup provides a meeting place   
 for pre-school age children. Between  
 the ages of five and eleven years     
 children attend the village Primary   
 School. After this age they are       
 transported by bus to the             
 Comprehensive School in               
 Barton-under-Needwood where all are   
 educated to the age of sixteen but may
 stay a further two years. Adult       
 education classes for ballroom dancing
 and keep fit are held in the village  
 while some people travel to           
 Barton-under-Needwood for classes in  
 other subjects. A Parent Teacher      
 Association at St.Peter's Primary     
 School keeps a watchful eye on all    
 aspects of school life. A travelling  
 library service is available. There is
 an evening class run by Keele         
 University on the history of Yoxall.
