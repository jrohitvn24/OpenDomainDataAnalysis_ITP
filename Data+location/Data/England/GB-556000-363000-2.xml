 Before 1930 the Butlins had a fair    
 where the County Hotel is now.Then    
 they moved to the site of the future  
 Bottons.They had dodgems,costa cars   
 hooplas,helta skelta and a figure     
 eight. Also they had a zoo, included  
 in the zoo were monkeys,lions,parrots,
 a camel,a tiger,a baby elephant and   
 many more.In 1952 there was a flood.  
 Mr McGeachy was informed by the police
 that the water was 6ft deep in the    
 park and that he was to kill the      
 animals.                              
{BOTTONS.}                             
 The Bottons Bros. bought the site     
 from  Butlins as they didn't want the 
 site.This was in 1965.At that time    
 they had 6 staff and more than 5      
 rides.Now in 1985 it has grown from 6 
 to 14 staff and from 5 rides 9.
