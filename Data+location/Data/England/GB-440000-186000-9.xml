The Day Centre was opened in 1973.It   
is open from 9.30am until 4pm on five  
days week.It caters for about 200      
people each week, usually 45 per day.  
  There is an organiser and a relief   
organiser. They look after elderly     
people who are lonely or who cannot    
manage  at home during the day.They    
make sure that everyone arrives and    
arrange transport,either cars or       
ambulances, for those who need it.     
                                       
The old people like to talk,make new   
friends or read the paper. They can do 
handicrafts such as making toys,       
doll's clothes or baskets.They can     
play cards or bingo.They can have      
their lunch and have their hair done   
or have their feet seen to.   We take  
harvest gifts to them in September.
