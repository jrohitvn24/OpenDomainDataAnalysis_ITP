		<title>15WOODLAND ECOLOGY:LOWESWATER</title>
		<content> The woodland has been National Trust  
 owned since 1936. Half of the trees   
 are of the soft wood variety e.g.     
 Pine. These are grown commercially for
 fencing material and also to be pulped
 for paper. Deciduous trees make up the
 other half e.g. Oak. It is N.T. policy
 to preserve the woodland in its'      
 natural state. There are two fulltime 
 and ten temporary workers employed as 
 foresters. Horses were used up to     
 1982 to move timber from steep areas, 
 but this is now fully mechanised.     
 Local wildlife includes badgers,red   
 squirrle, roe                         
 deer, foxes and wild mink. Mink are   
 not native to this country, but have  
 escaped from farms to which they were 
 imported and bred for their fur. They 
 are hunted because they               
 upset the balance of the natural      
 fauna.                                </content>
