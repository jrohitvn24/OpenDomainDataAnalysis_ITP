		<title>19Industrial Archaeology</title>
		<content> To the S.of Guisborough the N-facing  
 slope of the NY Moors is covered by   
 coniferous forest. But this hides the 
 scars of 4 centuries of mining. Alum  
 was 1st mined at Belmangate;this went 
 on until made uneconomic by the chem. 
 industry in 19th cent.Old clamps,in   
 which alum shale was burnt over many  
 months,still remain. This was a labour
 intensive but profitable ind. Next    
 came jet mining,&amp; spoil heaps can be  
 seen among the trees. The last indus- 
 try was ironstone mining.Old fragments
 of winch houses, rails,engine sheds,  
 are visible. Iron was smelted on Tee- 
 sside until recently; today all Clev- 
 eland ironstone mining has ceased, as 
 ores from Spain &amp; Scandinavia are     
 cheaper.Today Guisb. has little ind-  
 ustry of any kind,&amp; much unemployment;
 its industrial archaeology,however,   
 provides important relics of the past.</content>
