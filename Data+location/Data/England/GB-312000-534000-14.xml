		<title>14ARTS and CRAFTS, Blindcrake</title>
		<content>   Traditional crafts are practised by 
 many people in the village eg crochet,
 dressmaking and knitting as well as   
 more specialised pursuits.            
   Lace making has six followers in    
 four families. Bobbins are made of    
 wood or plastic wound with cotton or  
 thread and brass pins driven through a
 parchment pattern. The pillow is made 
 from a hard base and the cushion      
 packed tightly with straw.            
   Fly tying is popular due to the     
 close proximity of the river Derwent. 
   Spinning, pen and ink drawing,      
 stick dressing and calligraphy have   
 one or two devotees and one person    
 maintains the village scrap book.
