		<content>{  THE CHURCH OF SAINT PHILIP AND SAINT
{JAMES}SERVES THE COMMUNITIES OF BOTH  
 WHITTONSTALL AND NEWLANDS.AT PRESENT  
 THERE IS NO RESIDENT VICAR AND THE OLD
 VICARAGE WAS SOLD AS A PRIVATE        
 RESIDENCE SEVERAL YEARS AGO. CHURCH   
 ATTTENDANCE HAS FALLEN OFF IN RECENT  
 TIMES AND CONSEQUENTLY ONLY TWO       
 SERVICES A MONTH ,HOLY COMMUNION AND  
 EVENSONG,ARE HELD.BAPTISMS ,MARRIAGES 
 ,AND BURIALS ARE ALSO HELD.           
 THERE HAS BEEN A CHURCH OR CHAPEL ON  
  THE SITE FOR AT LEAST 600YEARS AND   
 IMPROVEMENTS UNDERTAKEN IN 1893 LEFT  
 THE CHURCH VERY MUCH IN ITS PRESENT   
 FORM. HIGHLIGHTS OF THE CHURCH'S YEAR 
 ARE CHRISTMAS AND HARVEST WHEN THE    
 SERVICE IS FOLLOWED BY A GRAND GET TO 
 GETHER KNOWN AS THE "SUPPER".THE      
 CHILDREN FROM THE SCHOOL ARE USUALLY  
 INVOLVED IN THESE ACTIVITIES.
