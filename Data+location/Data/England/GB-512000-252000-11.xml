 Brownies is for girls aged seven to   
 ten.Each pack has an adult leader     
 called Brown Owl.In my brownie pack   
 there are four sixes.The sixer is the 
 head of the group of six.             
 When you first start you do not wear  
 the brownie uniform.During the six    
 weeks before you are enrolled you have
 to learn the promise,law and motto.   
 Every brownie has to know these.At    
 enrolment your sixer takes you round a
 ring of brownies chanting a song.     
 Brownies work for interest badges     
 which include collectors,cook,athlete,
 and craft.                            
 Brownies wear a brown uniform and     
 hat.Later on you can go up into the   
 Guides.I go to brownies once a week   
 and enjoy it a lot.
