		<title>07CRIME IN OUR AREA.</title>
		<content>  In todays police-force you have to   
 do at least a two year beat before    
 you get any ranking.The lowest rank   
 is Constable and the highest rank is  
 Chief-Superintendant.                 
  The C.I.D (criminal investigation    
 department) usually deal with         
 assault,drugs,theft,auto-theft and    
 burglary.In our area it is the more   
 expensive property that is burgled    
 most often.Schools and shops are also 
 burgled,local schools are usally      
 broken into by their own pupils and a 
 lot of damage is caused.Videos        
 electronic equipment is stolen.       
  Pedal bikes are often stolen and are 
 very rarely recovered because they are
 taken apart and the bits are sold     
 seperately.The police are now stamping
 bikes with their owners post code in  
 an attempt to cut down on this type of
 theft.                                </content>
