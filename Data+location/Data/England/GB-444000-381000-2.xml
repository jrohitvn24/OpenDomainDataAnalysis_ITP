		<title>02WALES VILLAGE</title>
		<content> The population is growing here due to 
 new housing.Wales was once a mining   
 village.Now most of the pits have     
 closed down and there are lots of     
 different jobs.A few people own shops 
 or work at the school.The shopping    
 facilities have had little change.They
 are still quite poor.Nearly everyone  
 owns a car or even 2.There are more   
 buses now as well.They run on the main
 road.Just a few years ago the motorway
 was built in place of the cricket     
 field.                                
           Rother Valley Park has been 
 built very recently.It is just on the 
 edge of Wales.It was open-cast coal   
 land and farmland before the park was 
 built and Bedgreave mill was          
 working.The Park covers over 287      
 hectares of land &amp; it took about 6    
 years to complete.
