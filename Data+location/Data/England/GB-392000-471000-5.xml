		<content>   Like the other villages in          
 Littondale, Arncliffe has its own     
 Parish Meeting.  The meeting elects a 
 Chairman and Secretary.  All those on 
 the electoral roll of the village are 
 entitled to attend and vote.  Others, 
 such as those owning holiday cottages,
 may attend but not vote.  The Meeting 
 has a limited amount of money at its  
 disposal.  This money comes from the  
 letting of parish land.               
   Whilst the Meeting can discuss and  
 make decisions on matters of village  
 interest, major decisions are taken by
 Craven District Council, the Yorkshire
 Dales National Park (especially on    
 planning matters), and North Yorkshire
 County Council.                       
   For many years the area has been in 
 a Pariamentary constituency which has 
 returned a Conservative Member of     
 Parliament.                           </content>
