		<title>13"Social Walking"</title>
		<content>      As part of developing{social   } 
{contact}between parents and children  
 at Danesfield School a number of      
 evening walks on the{Quantocks}have   
 been arranged.   The organisation is  
 quite relaxed as it is impossible to  
 fit these in round everyones other    
 engagements and certainly there is no 
 control over the weather.   One such  
 walk was cancelled as it wasn't       
 possible in June to see 25 metres     
 through the swirling moorland mist!   
      Various numbers of{children with 
{their parents}join the{teacher,}now   
 acting in the role of walk leader and 
 guide.   The walks try to combine an  
 experience of both the{open moorland }
 and the{wooded combes.    }           
      It is no coincidence however     
 that the walks often go via the       
 garden of the{Bicknoller Inn}where a  
 pleasant{social event}is rounded off. </content>
