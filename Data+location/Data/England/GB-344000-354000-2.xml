		<content>   Schools have existed in Handley,    
 Broxton and Coddington but the only   
 school remaining is now at Clutton.   
 A document of 1622 reports J.Massie as
 giving a piece of land in Clutton with
 a building thereon to be used as a    
 Grammar School.This was probably the  
 site of the present school which dates
 from 1826.                            
  In 1956,twenty award winning council 
 houses were built in Clutton so the   
 present school was rebuilt in 1962.The
 old infant classroom was adapted as a 
 modern kitchen.Past records show much 
 concern about school attendance which 
 was often poor.Numbers on roll have   
 declined from over 50 in 1972 to 22 at
 present.
