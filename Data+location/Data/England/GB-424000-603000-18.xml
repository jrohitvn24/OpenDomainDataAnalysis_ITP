		<title>18SHOPPING IN AMBLE</title>
		<content> There is{a variety of shops}in Amble, 
 which{serve the surrounding area.     
{Shoppers}come from Amble, Warkworth,  
 Acklington and Hadston. Amble mainly  
 provides{lower order shopping goods,  
 such as bread, fruit and groceries.   
 There are{three larger supermarkets:  
 Co-op, Walter Wilsons and Liptons.    
 Recently many{shops have closed,      
 including three furniture stores -    
 indicating the lack of demand for     
 these types of goods in Amble.        
{Newcastle is a greater attraction.    
 Shoppers tend to{use Amble fairly     
{frequently -}at least twice a week.   
 There is{a number of specialist stores
 e.g. cobblers, tele-hire, DIY stores. 
 Their existence is due to the demand  
 for such services i.e. three DIY      
 stores exist because of the numbers   
 employed in the construction trade.   
 Soon{a new store is to be opened.     </content>
