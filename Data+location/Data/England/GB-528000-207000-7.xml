		<title>07St Mary's Church,Bayford</title>
		<content>{St Mary's Church}is a stone building  
 on the outskirts of Bayford. Built in 
 1864, it is the second church to be   
 built on this site, the first one     
 having fallen down.                   
  It is unusual because of its very    
{steep roof,}and spire in the middle.  
 The roof causes problems during winter
 when the hot air rises making the     
 church cold. Churches in this style   
 are associated with France.           
  Inside the church there are items    
 from the old church, including a{tomb 
{of George Knighton}dated 12th November
 1612. However, probably the oldest    
 items in the church are two 16th      
 century brasses on the wall, showing  
 knights wearing chain mail. The most  
 famous person to be buried at the     
 church is{William Yarrel,}famous for  
 his discovery of Berwick's swan.
