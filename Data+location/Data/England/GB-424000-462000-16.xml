		<content> GAMES WE PLAY                         
 Our favourite game is British bull    
 dogs. The object is to get across the 
 play ground with out getting cought.  
 Someone is it. Everybody stands in a  
 line across one end of the playground.
 The catcher stands in the middle of   
 the playground and calls one of the   
 children to come a cross, then all the
 rest of the children may run across   
 without being caught. Once the person 
 called has being caught he then helps 
 the catcher and so on everyone becomes
 a catcher. The last person to be      
 caught is in the next game and is the 
 best British Bulldog. Another is Stuck
 in the mud. Someone is it and tries to
 catch people. When you are caught you 
 stand like a cross with arms stretched
 out. Any child can come and release   
 you by crawling under your legs any   
 person caught 3 times is it next time.</content>
