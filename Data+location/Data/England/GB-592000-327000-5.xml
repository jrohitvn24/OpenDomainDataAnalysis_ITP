		<title>05Being at School in Fakenham</title>
		<content> When we first started school it was   
 good fun and we painted pictures and  
 didn't do much work because we were   
 only 4yrs. old. When we went into Miss
 Webb's class there were still lots of 
 toys but we had to do more work. Now  
 we are in Class 1 and we do a lot of  
 work, but we still have time to paint 
 and have fun. We are doing a lot of   
 work for the Domesday Project, but    
 that is fun. In September we will be  
 going to the Junior School where there
 are lots of bigger children, but lots 
 of us have brothers and sisters there 
 so we won't be scared. Our new teacher
 will be Mrs. Brown. When we are a lot 
 older we will go to the High School.  
 That school is very big with lots of  
 teachers and we don't know any of     
 them. Some of us know older children  
 who go to that school they say they   
 have to work very hard.               </content>
