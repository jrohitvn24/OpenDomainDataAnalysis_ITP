		<title>10HALLATON CHARITABLE TRUSTS</title>
		<content>  There are two charitable trusts in   
 Hallaton. The{Hallaton Charities}is an
 amalgamation of various trusts, some  
 dating from the 1700's, set up for the
 benefit of the villagers. It owns six 
 cottages in Hog Lane, and a small     
 recreation area (complete with seats  
 and rocking horse) in front. Until    
 1985,the street lighting in the       
 village was paid for by the Charities.
  The{Stenning Charity,}named after a  
 local benefactor Isabella Stenning,   
 provides the spacious village hall,   
 the main recreation ground and seven  
 cottages the tenants of which, until  
 recently, paid no rent.               
  The trustees of both charities now   
 meet jointly, at least four times a   
 year. Money is still given to the     
 sick, to children for school clothes, 
 and, particularly at Christmas, to    
 those who have fallen on hard times.  </content>
