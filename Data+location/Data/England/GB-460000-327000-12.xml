		<title>12Farming in 1985</title>
		<content> Farming is mainly arable with some fat
 cattle and sheep. Chief crops grown   
 are grass, wheat, barley and oilseed  
 rape, with its vivid yellow flowers.  
 Its oil is used in margarine. EEC     
 guaranteed prices have led to more    
 grain and rape being grown; oats are  
 now grown less. Harvesting is done by 
 combines, which both thresh the grain 
 and throw out the straw. Contractors  
 who take machines from farm to farm   
 are often employed for harvesting.    
 Commonly the stubble and surplus straw
 are burnt. This is said to kill pests 
 and diseases but the smoke can cause a
 nuisance and hedges and small animals 
 may be damaged. Use of pesticides and 
 herbicides has increased grain yields 
 and hedges have been grubbed out to   
 aid in use of machinery. Attempts to  
 drill seed without ploughing have not 
 been wholly successful.               </content>
