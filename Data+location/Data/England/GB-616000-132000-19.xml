		<title>19The Hill House</title>
		<content>  At the back of Hythe is an old       
 private house which is falling to     
 bits. This house has now been bought. 
 There are five flats and six to seven 
 rooms in each flat. This house used to
 belong to the Mackeston Brewery       
 family. At the back of the house were 
 some stables for horses; there was    
 also a rose garden, herbs and grape   
 vine in the green house. The property 
 is surrounded by a Kentish ragstone   
 wall. In the late 1960's and early    
 70's the house became a haven for     
 young people. A few of the young      
 people there tried to make the house  
 nice and look after it but more and   
 more people who were just 'passing    
 through' started to use the place and 
 vandalise it. This increased until    
 there was no lead on the roof and the 
 house started to decline because of   
 the leaks in the roof.                </content>
