		<title>15Games We Play .</title>
		<content> We play many games at school during   
 our playtimes.One popular game which  
 can be played by any number of        
 children is{Black Poison.}A person is 
 chosen to be It,they spread out their 
 hands and fingers and the other people
 take hold of one finger each.The      
 person who is It tells a story in     
 which each phrase refers to something 
 black.(I saw black cats on a black    
 bag.)As soon as they mention black    
 poison everybody runs away.They are   
 then chased,if they are had they stand
 'stuck in the mud'until they are freed
 by another child.Once you have been   
 had three times you become It.This    
 continues until you want to play      
 another game like Hopscotch.          
{Hopscotch}is a throwing and jumping   
 game.You need to draw a brickwall     
 pattern of ten numbered squares.
