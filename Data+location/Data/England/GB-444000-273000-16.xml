		<title>16Children's Favourite Games 3</title>
		<content>  There are many games played indoors  
 with the help of a television and     
 video, these are very popular with the
 children.One of these is a game called
 "Firefox F-7".This game has 3 levels  
 of difficulty and 6 'phases' to it.The
 aim of the game is to attack various  
 targets which are being defended by a 
 number of things aircraft, ships,     
 tunnels and mines.The various attacks 
 take place in the various 'phases' of 
 the game and may involve one or more  
 of the defenders trying to destroy you
 the attacker.The attack is controlled 
 by the player using a 'Joy Stick'     
 control to dodge and weave away from  
 defenders and also shoot them down. If
 the player succesfully defeats the    
 defenders in the first level then the 
 game restarts on Level 2 which is more
 difficult,if the player fails to      
 defeat the defence the game ends.     </content>
