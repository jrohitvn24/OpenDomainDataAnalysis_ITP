		<content> A school questionaire revealed the    
 following: Many people have leisure   
 technology in their homes, such as 2  
 televisions, record players, tape     
 recorders and hi-fi's. Videos don't   
 seem to be catching on though it is a 
 recent invention.Clubs and hobbies are
 also popular. There are a lot of local
 football clubs and many boys belong to
 them. Many girls belong to ballet     
 classes. School leisure consists of   
 clubs:tennis, pottery, football and   
 more. Swimming &amp; rounders are some    
 of the 'fun' activities of school. A  
 family holiday to America might cost  
 Â£3000 for four. Stamp collecting,     
 piano, football &amp; ballet come high up 
 the list of hobbies. Overall, people  
 spend about one-third of their lives  
 in leisure activities. But the        
 question is: Will the fraction be     
 larger or smaller in 100 years time?  </content>
