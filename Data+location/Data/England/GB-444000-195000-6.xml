    The church is in the north west    
part of Marcham. In  the               
tower of the church there is a         
belfry.The belfry is medieval.         
The medieval belfry is one of the      
very few in the country.               
   The main part of the church was     
rebuilt in 1837 by Thomas Duffield,    
the MP for Abingdon. The vicar in      
Marcham lives in the vicarage. The old 
vicarage was called Netherfield House  
which was built in 1850 in Church      
Street.                                
   The vicar and the church wardens are
trustees of the Anson Trust. This was  
started in memory of Arthur Anson in   
1913 to benefit the village. The       
Village Institute (St Nicholas) is     
part of the trust.
