		<title>17TEACHERS' PAY DISPUTE</title>
		<content> Currently there is an industrial      
 dispute between many of the teachers  
 who live in the village and           
 surrounding areas and the Education   
 Authority. After a similar dispute    
 in 1974 teachers' salaries were       
 increased to be comparable with       
 similar salaries in the private       
 sector.Since that time the real value 
 of teachers'salaries has declined as  
 inflation has had its effects. The    
 shortfall now is about 34%. Teachers  
 have been on strike on a number of    
 days this year in an attempt to       
 improve a pay offer of 4%, with an    
 inflation rate this year of about 7%. 
 At the time of writing this dispute is
 unresolved. Matters are not helped by 
 the effect of the Conservative        
 Government's legislation which enables
 it to control the amount spent by     
 Local Authorities on school education.</content>
