		<title>04ST. LUKE'S STOKE PRIOR</title>
		<content>                                       
   On Tuesday 4th June we (Form 2T)    
 visited{St Luke's church}in Stoke     
 Prior, which is situated on a mound   
 overlooking the old part of the       
 village, with its now disused pump.   
 The church looks old, but was         
 completely rebuilt in the{Gothic style
 by{George Colley of London in 1863.   
 There is a picture of the former      
 church just inside the door. We looked
 for old gravestones in the churchyard 
 and found one for 1804, though there  
 were stone tablets from the 17th c.   
 inside the church.                    
   At the time of{Domesday}Stoke Prior 
 belonged to the{manor of Leominster.  
   Services are held in the church on  
 Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday.         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
