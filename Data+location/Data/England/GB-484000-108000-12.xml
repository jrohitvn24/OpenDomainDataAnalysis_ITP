		<title>12The Devil's Ditch</title>
		<content> The Devil's Ditch starts in the Valdoe
 woods opposite the Forage cottages.The
 Devil's Ditch was made about 100.B.C. 
 by a tribe of Celts called Attrabates.
 A Ditch was constructed to stop the   
 tribes from the north attacking the   
 tribes the south.When they were first 
 built they were just soil but now they
 are covered with grass.The Ditch is   
 4km.long and 2m.high. Some of it has  
 disappeared to make way for roads and 
 houses. Its a great place to play.
