		<content> Girls aged between eight and eleven   
 like wearing ski trousers or short    
 skirts with a tee shirt or sweat      
 shirt.                                
 Big earings, beads and bangles in     
 bright colours like red, blue, yellow,
 white and orange are popular.         
 Watches usually have games on them as 
 well as alarms.                       
 Some girls wear wrist bands with names
 of pop groups on, like"WHAM". Girls   
 wear pointed shoes, roman sandals,    
 canvas shoes or trainers.             
 Girls with long hair wear clips called
 crocodile or butterfly clips. Girls   
 with short hair have it permed or     
 flicked. Most girls of this age do not
 wear make up, except for special      
 occasions.
