		<title>03New Fritchley School</title>
		<content> Today Fritchley has a C. E. Primary   
 School with nearly 100 children in 4  
 classes. It is fairly new and quite   
 large with a playground and a playing 
 field. The lessons we have are Maths, 
 Handwriting, English, Reading, Art and
 Craft, Science, Topic, Story, PE      
 (floorwork or apparatus) and our own  
 personal topics. We watch a TV        
 programme called "Science Workshop".  
 On Wednesdays we have singing practice
 and games outside. When it is  a dry  
 playtime you can play anything you    
 want. We play Elastics, Tik,          
 Stuck-in-the-Mud, Spider, Gluepot and 
 Football. During wet playtimes you    
 have to read a book, play indoor games
 or draw a picture.At dinner time 2    
 dinner Ladies put your food out on    
 the plates. The food is cooked in     
 the canteen so it is fresh and hot.
