		<content> On both sides of the River there are  
 no{Police Staions}.Residents in Rodley
 said there was no real crime but some 
 farmers stated that they would like to
 see a{local Policeman}.They feared    
 vandalism could increase and stealing 
 from property could be easy. On the   
 north side, the nearest{Police Staion}
 to Rodley is at Newnham, four miles   
 away. Occasionally the police visit   
 the area just to check things out.    
 On the south side, Frampton is the    
 nearest{Police Station}to our         
 area. Residents notice that the Police
 patrol in a{Panda Car}or on{Motor     
{Cycles}perhaps once a week, mainly    
 during the night time. The Police and 
 the Community have good relations     
 because the area has a low crime rate.
