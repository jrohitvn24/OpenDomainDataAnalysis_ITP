{   }Situated on the junction of the   
 A35 and A354 Puddletown has a         
 considerable amount of traffic passing
 through it,especially in the summer   
 holiday season.It is planned that it  
 shall have a by-pass built in the near
 future.                               
     The area has to some extent become
 a dormitory area for people working in
 the nearby towns, such as Dorchester  
 and Poole.This has meant that a       
 considerable number of young families 
 have recently moved in to the area.   
     Puddletown is a thriving community
 with numerous clubs and associations  
 for young and old alike.A library,a   
 village hall, a youth centre and two  
 schools (a 5-9 first school and a 9-13
 middle school) help maintain this     
 community spirit and activity.
