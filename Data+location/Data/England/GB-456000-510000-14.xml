		<title>14Roseberry Topping,Gt.Ayton.</title>
		<content> Roseberry Topping stands ,320 metres  
 above sea level.In 1912 the peak      
 collapsed because of ironstone mining 
 underneath.People think that this     
 would have happened naturally anyway. 
 Rocks still fall,and there are still  
 worries that it will fall down        
 completely in a few years time.       
 Originally Roseberry Topping might    
 have been called{Odinsbergh} (the hill
 of the God,Odin).Odinsbergh may have  
 changed over the years to Oseberry    
 which  is easier to say.On the top of 
 Roseberry Topping stands a stone post 
 used for making surveys of the        
 surrounding country-side.             
        As you climb Roseberry Topping 
 you will see a small tower called the 
{Shooting Lodge.}Built on the diagonal 
 slope of Roseberry Topping,the tower  
 is made from{whinstone.}Lots of       
 visitors enjoy climbing the hill.     </content>
