		<content> The area of {Mawgan in Meneage }on    
 the Lizard peninsula consists mainly  
 of agricultural land. Central to the  
 landscape are the villages of {Mawgan}
 and{Gweek}both of which are mentioned 
 in the first Domesday Book. Although  
 less than 2km apart,the villages are  
 quite different in character.Mawgan   
 being quiet,quaint and straggly with  
 few amenties.Gweek,the ancient port   
 of Helston is clustered around the    
 river Helford.Although the river is   
 silted up,the village has a role to   
 play still,in trading.                
 Pottry,coal,iron and pleasure craft   
 all operate from here.The tourist     
 trade is attracted to Gweek by the    
 seal sanctuary-a refuge for injured   
 and abandoned seals.Dominating the    
 landscape is the R.N.A.S. Culdrose,the
 biggest helicopter base in Europe.An  
 air day is held every year.           </content>
