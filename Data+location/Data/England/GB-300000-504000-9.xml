		<title>09A School Day</title>
		<content>  The school day begins at 9 o'clock   
with registration. At ten past nine we 
have an Assembly. In today's Assembly  
our Headmistress told us the story of  
Caedmon. After that we sung a hymn and 
said a prayer. After Assembly we have a
lesson which is usually mathematics.We 
tackle tasks such as fractions, area   
and volume.Sometimes we work from books
or we may use our computer. After the  
lesson we have a break from work. Lunch
is cooked in the school kitchen. After 
lunch we have an integrated session    
when we work in small groups on        
different subjects. This is followed by
games, music or story until home time  
at 3 o'clock. Once each week we go by  
coach to the swimming baths at Wyndham 
Comprehensive School at Egremont.
