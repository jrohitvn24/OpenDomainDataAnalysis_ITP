		<title>14Coaley - a profile</title>
		<content>  Coaley has a population of around 900
 people. During the last 10 years there
 have been no major changes and most of
 the houses are between 10 and 400     
 years old.                            
  The development of The Close some 10 
 years ago brought many new people to  
 the village mostly from outside       
 Gloucestershire.                      
  Most people travel to work by car.   
 The easy access to motorway and other 
 main routes putting Coaley within easy
 reach of many major towns including   
 Bristol, Cheltenham and Gloucester.   
  Apart from the local farmers, a few  
 farm labourers, the shopkeeper, the   
 publican and the mill owner very few  
 people live and work in the village.  
 Many retired people live here.        
  Coaley in the 1980's is a pleasant,  
 busy and friendly place to live.
