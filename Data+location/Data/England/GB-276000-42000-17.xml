		<title>17A day in my Life.</title>
		<content> First my alarm wakes me up at 8.00 in 
 the morning. I get washed and dressed 
 and go down stairs for breakfast. I   
 have "Frosties" for my cereal and     
 toast with honey. Next I go upstairs  
 to clean my teeth. I put my coat and  
 shoes on and get in the car. We get to
 Stokenham School at nine o'clock. I go
 out to play until half past nine. When
 we come in we have the register then  
 we go into Assembly. After Assembly we
 read for ten minutes then we go to    
 watch T.V. After that we go out to    
 play. After play we work. At 12.15 we 
 go for our lunch and then play until  
 1.30. Today we got some paper and a   
 drawing board and went outside and    
 drew part of the school. At 2.45 we   
 came back and went out to play then we
 had music. We went home at 4.00 and I 
 watched T.V. After tea I went out to  
 play with my friends until bedtime.   </content>
