 denominations are well represented.   
 The parish church of{St. James}is     
 about half a mile from the town centre
 at Mytholm.{Heptonstall}parish church 
 was built during the 19th century like
 St. James, but the parish itself goes 
 back to medieval times. Hebden Bridge 
 has a new{Methodist}church while      
 Heptonstall has an old octagonal      
 building which has been in continuous 
 use since the days of John Wesley.{St.
{Thomas'}Roman Catholic church is on   
 the south side of the town and the    
 priest in charge supervises three     
 other churches in the Calder Valley.  
 The two{Baptist}chapels are located in
 the town centre.                      
 There are other 'fringe' religions    
 pracised by small groups of people but
 no major world religions.
