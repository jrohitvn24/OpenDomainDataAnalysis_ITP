		<content> MOAT FARM - MR.KEENE  ARABLE FARMING  
 Arable farming is very predominant in 
 this area of Gloucestershire. The     
 farms are generally very large and    
 highly mechanized. We visited two     
 arable farms as part of our project,  
 Moat Farm and Ploddy House.           
 Moat Farm consists of 500 acres,(200  
 Hectares). The farm name comes from   
 the fact that the farmhouse stands on 
 an island with a bridge over the moat.
 The house and some of the farm dates  
 back to 1640 but the majority of the  
 house was rebuilt in 1892.            
 Mr. Keene has owned the farm for 30   
 years and he has gradually built the  
 farm up to its present size. He       
 employs 5 workers and they all work   
 full-time. They all live locally and  
 they travel to work by car or bike.   
 They work a 40 hour week, which is    
 generally 8 hours for 5 days.         </content>
