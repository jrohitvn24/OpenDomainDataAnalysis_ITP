		<title>04HOUSING - REIGATE/REDHILL</title>
		<content>     Good communications, employment   
 opportunities &amp; lovely countryside    
 have helped create high demand for    
 housing.Properties vary from Victorian
 terraces &amp; villas to big post-war     
 detached houses with large sites &amp;    
 magnificent views.  There is some pre-
 Victorian property; virtually no high 
 density modern development, &amp; 3 small 
 council estates in the{eastern zone.  
{  }The M25 runs through the semi-rural
{northern area. }The{central zone}has  
 some of the most expensive housing;   
 select properties near the Downs may  
 exceed Â£350,000 in price.             
    The{southern zone}contains the 2   
 town centres.Reigate seems more highly
 regarded &amp; prices tend to decline from
 west to east - Redhill generally being
 slightly cheaper. Some properties in  
 the south east sell for c.Â£40,000. The
 area is overall desirable &amp; affluent. </content>
