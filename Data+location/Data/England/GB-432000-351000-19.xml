 conclusions.                          
 Of a total of 306 responses from  110 
 people the domain of sport was the    
 most popular category with over 20% of
 the total responses. A wide variety of
 sports and games were represeuted     
 inculing shooting caving, windsurfing,
 climbing and fishing but the highest  
 counts were for ball sports.          
 Gardening, reading and walking were   
 next in importance followed by the    
 fields of music, art and craft,       
 knitting and radio/television
