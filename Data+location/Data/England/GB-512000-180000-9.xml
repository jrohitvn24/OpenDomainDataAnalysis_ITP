		<title>09ST. JOHN'S CHURCH SOUTHALL</title>
		<content> St. John's Church is Anglican. Apart  
 from the church there is a parish     
 centre and a play centre. In 1910 a   
 new church was built to replace the   
 old which had become too small. It    
 faces East and is built of limestone  
 from the south of England. The        
 ceilings are of wood. The stone font  
 was brought from the original church  
 in King Street. It took one year to   
 build. So far twelve vicars have      
 worked there. There is one bell so the
 present vicar uses a tape recording of
 bells to call the people to the       
 services.
