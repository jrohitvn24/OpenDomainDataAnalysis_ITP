		<title>13Parents Today</title>
		<content>{Years}ago we would not have parents   
 like we have today.{Years}ago we would
 not get as much{attention}because     
 families would be very{big.}They would
 have many children. My teacher's      
 mother-in-law had 10 brothers and     
 sisters. Also you would not spend much
 time with your parents because you    
 would have a nurse, if you were rich. 
 If you weren't rich you would play in 
 the{street.}These days we only have{  
{small}families and we go to{playgroup.
 We do not have a nurse. We spend more 
 time with our parents so we are very  
 different from people years ago.
