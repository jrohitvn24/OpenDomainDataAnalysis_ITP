		<title>02ATTITUDES TO AYLESBURY</title>
		<content>We surveyed people's attitudes towards 
Aylesbury.We asked them their thoughts 
on the"Blue Leanie"which is a modern   
insurance building.Half the people we  
asked said it was an eyesore but the   
rest said it was quite attractive.We   
also asked what facility they thought  
Aylesbury needed most.46% said that it 
needed a sports centre,31%,a department
store.According to our survey Aylesbury
is a pleasant place.Quite a few old    
people disagreed with this because they
said the place had deteriorated over   
the years.Nearly all the people said   
Aylesbury isn't good for shopping as   
most of the main shops are scattered   
around the town so you either have to  
walk or take the car which could cost  
money parking.94% said there wasn't    
enough entertainment for the young.A   
few felt the facilities available were 
not properly used.                     </content>
