		<title>09Lea Hurst</title>
		<content>   The estate of Lea Hurst first came  
 into the possesion  of the Nightingale
 family in{1707.}The house known as,   
 'Lea Hurst' was built by Florence's   
 father.                               
   The land covered an area of 640     
 acres. The house is made of Derbyshire
 gritstone with a slate slab roof. It  
 is situated in a beautiful area with  
 magnificent views.                    
    It remained in the Nightingale     
 family until{1940}when Louis S.       
 Nightingale died. In{1946}it was      
 offered for sale by auction. Prior to 
 the sale the house and land was used  
 as a home for nurses by the executers 
 of the will.                          
    The house was given to the Royal   
 Surgical Aid Society in{1951}by the   
 executors of the will of the late Lt. 
 Col. E.S. Halford. Since then it has  
 been used as a home for old people.   </content>
