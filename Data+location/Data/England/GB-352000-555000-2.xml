		<title>02WOMEN'S INSTITUTE</title>
		<content>    The Women's Institutes at Castle   
 Carrock and Talkin have, respectively,
 23 and 2O members.   That of Castle   
 Carrock has been meeting once a month 
 for 66 years and its members come from
 the village and outlying communities. 
                                       
    The programme of both Institues is 
 similar - business followed by a      
 speaker or demonstration.   Subjects  
 cover a wide variety of topical       
 issues, crafts, cookery, etc.   The   
 evening ends with refreshments.       
                                       
    Visits from, and to, other         
 Institutes take place throughout the  
 year and members also attend events   
 organised by the various committees of
 the Cumbria Federation.
