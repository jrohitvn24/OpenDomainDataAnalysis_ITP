		<title>14ST. BARTHOLOMEW'S BURWASH</title>
		<content>     The Church of St. Bartholomew's is
 built of stone, partly in the Early   
 English style, but having a Norman    
 tower, with a spire, containing a     
 clock and six bells.                  
    The Church can seat 500 persons, it
 was enlarged and restored in 1856, the
 tower in 1890. The Register dates from
 the year 1558. There is a cast iron   
 grave slab that is believed to date   
 from the 14th century.                
    The Church is on a bend in the High
 Street and if you walk through the    
 churchyard you enter the school       
 playground, just here there is a      
 really lovely view across the valley  
 towards the River Dudwell.            
    I pass the church everyday on my   
 way to school, I sing in the choir on 
 Sundays and the choir practise on     
 Friday evenings. I was christened here
 in the village church.                </content>
