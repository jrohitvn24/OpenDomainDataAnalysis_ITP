		<title>01LANDSCAPE IN 04760354</title>
		<content> The landscape in 04760354 has been    
 formed by the ravages of the Ice Age. 
 Thus the Trent River Valley evolved.  
 The Trent meanders from slightly      
 higher ground near Averham Church     
 skirting the built up village area,   
 through lower cultivated farmland it  
 circumnavigates Kelham Hall.Here land 
 is likely to frequent flooding in the 
 populated area of Kelham beyond the   
 river.The river winds onwards and     
 arrives below the higher ground on    
 which Newark Castle is situated.The   
 lower land below this is again a built
 up area which is subject to flooding. 
 The main A617 road winds past Averham 
 through Kelham and is one of the      
 routes through Newark.This is a very  
 busy road and is subject to much      
 congestion.A by-pass is proposed in   
 the future.A railway line also crosses
 the area.                             </content>
