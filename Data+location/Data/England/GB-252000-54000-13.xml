		<title>13Industry in Plympton</title>
		<content>   The industry in Plympton is         
 concentrated into two main areas,     
 namely the{Cot Hill}and{Newnham       
 Industrial Estates.                   
   The Cot Hill site was originally    
 part of the{Great Western Railway     
 marshalling yards. The more recent    
 additons to the Industrial Estate have
 been some buildings between the main  
 railway line and Plymouth Road, on    
 what was once scrub land. Most of the 
 industry is commercial, including many
 "Do-it-Yourself" stores, Hypermarkets 
 and garages. Three buildings are      
 unoccupied at present, although one   
 has been sold. Of the other two       
 buildings, one is for sale, and the   
 other is on lease.                    
   To the west end of Cot Hill there is
 a {Sewage Treatment Works }which      
 serves the whole of the Plympton area.
