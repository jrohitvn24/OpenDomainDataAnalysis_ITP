 Longhope Primary School who told us   
  about his fathers farm.It is called  
{'BARN FARM'}and covers 100 acres of   
 land.It has 1000 sheep and over 50    
 beef cattle. His pets include 2 ducks,
 4 chickens,2 cockerels,a hen and      
 chicks, a cat, a rabbit and 2         
 sheepdogs. They don't sell any of the 
 eggs they produce, they are just      
 for their own use. Apart from his     
 Mother,sister and himself, his father 
 employs a man to help during the week 
 and a boy at weekends. They use 2     
 tractors, ploughs, bailers and all the
 other necessary farm equipment. Also  
 part of his land is taken up by plums,
 cider apples and perry pears in their 
 orchards.
