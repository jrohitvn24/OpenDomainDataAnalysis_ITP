		<title>12CHANGE IN SUTTON ST JAMES</title>
		<content> We organised ourselves into groups of 
 four or five , and agreed on the      
 questions that we would put inthe     
 survey. We decided to ask questions   
 based on any changes that may have    
 happened since the 1939-1945 War. We  
 chose six senior citizens, who were   
 pleased to talk and give information. 
 Not all of these six people have lived
 in Sutton St. James all their lives,  
 and so we felt them to be fairly      
 representative of the village         
 population.                           
 1){ARE YOU FROM THIS VILLAGE?         
  Four out of six people had been born 
 and bred in the village. The other two
 came from nearby villages, and had    
 always known Sutton St. James well    
 before they even came here to live,   
 and had a wide knowledge of families  
 in the area.
