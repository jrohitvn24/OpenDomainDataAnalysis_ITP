Years ago Salt Lane was used to carry  
salt from {Droitwich to Banbury}.      
People knew they carried salt along    
it, and that is how it became known as 
{Salt Lane}. Today when we go along it 
there is only a mud track.  When we    
went along it, it was very muddy and I 
lost my boots. Salt Lane is used for   
horse riding when its dry and for      
walking along. It is also used by      
cyclists as a short-cut to Broughton   
Castle and Giant's Cave. The bushes    
are growing a lot because they are not 
cut.                                   
                                       
Salt Lane is {6 kilometres long} and   
about 5 metres wide.
