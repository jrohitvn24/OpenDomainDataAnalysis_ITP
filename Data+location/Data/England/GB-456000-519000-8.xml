 The major farm in the area is owned by
 I.C.I. and has been since 1944. It    
 takes up 750 acres of farmland and    
 1000 acres of woodland. Four men are  
 employed and a full time secretary.   
 Each labourer has a different respons-
 -ibility e.g.looking after the cattle.
 The farm contains 1200 sheep,1900     
 lambs and 200 cows.The main crops are 
 wheat, barley, oilseed rape and grass.
 Trees are grown for the dual purpose  
 of paper making and as a wind break.On
 the land combine harvesters and       
 tractors are used.I.C.I. uses the farm
 to make money and show customers of   
 the agricultural division the best way
 to use I.C.I. products.The manager    
 envisages the farm concentrating less 
 on crops and more on meat production.
