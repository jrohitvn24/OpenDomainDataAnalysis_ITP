		<content>    Most of the land is devoted to     
 farming and the residential areas of  
 Egglescliffe, Eaglescliffe and Preston
 on Tees, although the area has the    
 Royal Navy Distribution Centre and    
 some industry at Urlay Nook and on the
 Eaglescliffe Industrial Estate. These 
 attract employees from the immediate  
 locality as well as from the larger   
 towns nearby. Many of the people      
 living here commute to work in        
 Darlington and other parts of         
 Cleveland.                            
    One of the reasons for settlement  
 of the area was due to its importance 
 as a centre of communication based on 
 easy river access linked with roads   
 and later railways.This is still a    
 valuable asset to the area with main  
 road (A19 and A1(M)) and rail (London 
 to Edinburgh) routes close at hand,   
 while Teesside Airport is also nearby.</content>
