		<content>{ The Whitestone Tile Works}stand in   
 about 3 acres and employ 67 workers of
 which 17 are staff.                   
  They produce{glazed wall tiles}for   
 kitchen and bathroom. The biscuit     
 tiles they use are made from clay in  
 Stoke-On-Trent.                       
  Most of the work is done by machine, 
 including: painting, transfer, glazing
 and then firing in the kilns. The main
 sives produced are 6"x 6",6"x 8" and  
 8"x 4", there are about 150 designs in
 all.                                  
  The finished tiles are sent to       
 customers around the country and some 
 are exported to Africa, Australia and 
 the Arab States.                      
  A fire destroyed some of th offices  
 in 1983, but Mr.Green, the manager,   
 says that they will be rebuilt soon,  
 and he hopes to increase production in
 the future.                           </content>
