		<content> Much of the southern third of this    
 area was occupied until recently by   
 the northern part of a wartime        
 airfield. Much of this land has been  
 returned to farmland. Only those areas
 of extensive surface and underground  
 installations, such as runways and    
 shelters are not now farmed. Even     
 these latter areas are however        
 utilised either as sites for crop     
 stores or other farm buildings, or for
 woodland, both for timber and as cover
 for game-birds. Some of the old       
 military installations are located in 
 the Site of Special Scientific        
 Interest at King Lud's Entrenchments, 
 currently the site of nature          
 conservation work.
