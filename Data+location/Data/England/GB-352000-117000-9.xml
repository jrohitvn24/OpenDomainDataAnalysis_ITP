		<content>  Boundary Precision Engineering is    
 situated on the Lufton Trading Estate.
 The firm's two owners began business  
 in 1982 and now employ 4 men.They need
 more workers but finding skilled men  
 is difficult.They borrowed money to   
 begin the business and have added four
 more machines in the last year.The    
 firm makes dies for investment        
 castingss or plastics and does        
 machining on a sub-contract basis.    
  The small firm is typical of the     
 small businesses which have grown up  
 on the trading estate.Most employ     
 small numbers and are dependant on    
 large firms such as Westland for      
 survival.There has been anxiety       
 recently that the problems of the big 
 companies will rub off onto the small 
 works,causing unemployment and debt.
