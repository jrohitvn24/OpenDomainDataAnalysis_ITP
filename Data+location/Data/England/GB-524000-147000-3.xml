		<title>03EDUCATION IN SOUTH REIGATE</title>
		<content>       The Primary education in the    
 area is organised on the basis of     
 first schools (age range 5-8)of which 
 there are three and Middle Schools    
 (age range 8-12) of which there are   
 two:St Luke's CE Middle and Woodhatch 
 Middle.Both these schools have the low
 intake of approx 150 children each    
 which can be attributed to 1. the     
 demographic trend in which a falling  
 birthrate during the past ten years   
 coupled with the recession has meant a
 decliming junior school population.   
 2.the over provision of Primary school
 places within the Reigate area as a   
 whole.                                
       As a consequence of the above   
 St Luke's and Woodhatch Middle Schools
 will combine as one County School on  
 the St Luke's site in September 1986.
