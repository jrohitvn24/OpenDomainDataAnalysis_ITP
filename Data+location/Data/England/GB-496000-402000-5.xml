		<content>  Other towns and villages include     
 Waddingham, Kirton Lindsey, Redbourne,
 Scotter, Elsham, Alford, Blyton,      
 Gainsthorpe, Barnetby, Cadney, Manton,
 and South Killingholme. Employment    
 within the village accounts for only  
 17% of those surveyed.These jobs as   
 expected are mostly associated with   
 agriculture with several farm workers,
 a stockman and a farm manager.Other   
 village industries surprisingly employ
 few workers from our village.Only one 
 lorry driver, no workers from Sargents
 ice creams and one hotel manageress.  
 We also found some interesting answers
 with our mobility questions.We        
 discovered the majoriy of families    
 have come to the village from         
 elsewhere within 5 years, mostly from 
 nearby villages,Brigg and Scunthorpe.
