		<title>18The Duke of Norfolk.</title>
		<content>The Duke of Norfolk is a familiar face 
in our area.The Duke served in the army
for 30 years and he has met the Royal  
Family,Montgomery,Churchill and General
Eisenhower.He started at the bottom of 
the ladder and worked his way up to the
rank of Major General. After 30 years  
in the services,the Duke went to the   
war office in London then he quit the  
army for good.                         
  I feel very honoured to have a man   
who has done so much for his country   
living not half a mile away from me.   
  The Duke has been a lord for 10 years
now, ever since his brother died in    
1975.Before embarking on his army      
career the Duke was a Woodpigeon in    
the scouts.                            
  He has a castle called Arundel but   
this is now a museum.                  
  He loves Yorkshire and England and   
he enjoys living in Hambleden.         </content>
