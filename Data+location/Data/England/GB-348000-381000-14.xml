		<content> In the morning I wake up,pull off the 
 continental quilt,climb out of        
 bed,gather up my clothes from the     
 cupboard,go downstairs and go into the
 bathroom.I go to the toilet and then  
 get washed at the sink.Before         
 breakfast I get dressed.For my        
 breakfast I have toast and a cup of   
 tea.By this time it is about 8.20am. I
 walk up to school and meet Stephanie.I
 arrive at school at about 9.00 o'clock
 we have lessons until 12.00 0'clock.We
 have dinner until 1.00 o'clock.Then we
 have lessons until 3.30pm after school

 my friends until 6.00pm.Then I have my
 tea and go back out until 8.30pm.When 
 I come in I have a bath and go to bed
