		<title>15FARLEY'S TREES AND SHRUBS</title>
		<content> Farley is surrounded by woodland. Some
 of this is softwood (pine) planted for
 use in the timber industry. Some is   
 old, natural woodland and one of these
 is Blackmoor Copse. One day in July,  
 1985, on a walk through Blackmoor     
 Copse we saw the following trees and  
 shrubs: ash, sycamore, ivy, hazel,    
 horse chestnut, holly, oak,           
 honeysuckle, hawthorn, dog rose, lime,
 yew, old man's beard, pussy willow,   
 blackberry and fir.                   
 Hound Wood has a stretch of beeches,  
 probably named after its owner of many
 years ago and called Shrubb's Beeches.
 Farley Copse and Brown's Copse are    
 mixed deciduous trees including oak   
 and birch.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
