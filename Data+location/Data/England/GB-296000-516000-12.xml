		<title>12WHITEHAVEN SUPERMARKETS.</title>
		<content> Whitehaven has several supermarkets   
 ,the newest being Presto's.It has been
 opened for about 6 months.It has      
 brought employment to the area;120    
 jobs have been taken up by the people 
 of Whitehaven.The most profitable     
 sections of the store are fresh       
 foods,fish &amp; the bakery.The bakery is 
 on the premises.This is an advantage  
 because stock can be replenished when 
 necessary.Prestos has a fresh fish    
 dept. which no other supermarket in   
 Whitehaven possesses.Over 4500        
 different articles are sold in the    
 shop &amp; nearly every country in the    
 world supplies goods.Another good     
 seller is the items in the wine,beer &amp;
 spirits dept.Customers say this branch
 is more expensive than the one in     
 Workington but the management         
 disagree.An inexpensive car park      
 nearby helps to attract customers.    </content>
