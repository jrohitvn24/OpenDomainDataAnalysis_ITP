		<title>07The Methodist Church</title>
		<content> There are three churches in           
 Cleobury Mortimer. The Reverend       
 Parry has been a Minister in the      
 Methodist Church since 1961 and       
 has been here in Cleobury since       
 1978. Mr. Parry told us that there    
 are fifty-four members of the church  
 and about fifty worship there every   
 Sunday, showing that the members      
 of the church are very loyal. The     
 services on Sunday are usually        
 with the Reverend Parry, but sometimes
 there is a visiting preacher. To be a 
 member of the church you have to      
 believe in God and Jesus, and want to 
 be a servant of them and love them.   
 The Reverend Parry has to take three  
 different services at three different 
 churches each Sunday. The Methodist   
 Church has a very flourishing Sunday  
 School.                               
                                       </content>
