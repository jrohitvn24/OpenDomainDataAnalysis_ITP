		<title>13Fisher Interview:continued.</title>
		<content> Many older houses have been modernised
 and new ones have been built much     
 closer together with less space for   
 gardens and as a result the 'feel' of 
 the village has changed dramatically. 
 Mr.Fisher likes the village because it
 is central in Norfolk,but admits that 
 he has known no other village well.   
 His chief dislikes are litter and     
 dirty dogs (and their owners).        
    The shops have changed a good deal:
 ten years ago there were only seven,  
 now there are fourteen.The shops are  
 now mainly self-service,whereas there 
 used to be assistants.                
    He would like to see no changes    
 except a more caring attitude to the  
 village from its inhabitants,in       
 particular where tidiness is          
 concerned. His favourite place in the 
 village is his home,and he likes his  
 job.                                  </content>
