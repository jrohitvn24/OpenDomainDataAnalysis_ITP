		<title>08Bluebell Walk, Bates Farm.</title>
		<content>  Each year, when the bluebells are in 
 flower, a woodland walk is open to the
 public at Bates Green Farm on         
 otherwise private property.           
  Profits from entrance fees go to     
 local causes such as, this year,      
 towards the cost of building a new    
 village hall in Arlington.            
  Refreshment stalls are manned by     
 volunteers from local charities which 
 benefit from the proceeds.            
  The barn houses an exhibition staged 
 by the local village school.          
  The walk is a popular family         
 attraction and is very widely         
 publicised.                           
  This farmer has received an award for
 conservation of wildlife on his farm. 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
