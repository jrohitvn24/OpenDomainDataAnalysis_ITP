		<content>{  Somerton}is a thriving, rural town  
 situated in the middle of Somerset.   
 The population is less than 4500 and  
 has doubled since 1951 as many new    
 private and council estates have been 
 built. Originally most workers were   
 employed in agriculture but Yeovilton 
 Air Base, Westland Helicopters, Clarks
 Shoes and a light industrial estate on
 the edge of Somerton have brought in  
 many families from  all over Britain. 
   The surrounding countryside is      
 largely unspoiled, being mainly dairy 
 farming and cereal growing.In the     
 south-eastern corner is the village of
{Kingsdon},which like Somerton is a    
 dormitory town for Yeovilton Air Base.
 Both towns are mainly built of local  
 limestone and hamstone.Because of its 
 position and attractive buildings     
 Somerton is a popular centre for      
 tourists visiting the West Country.   </content>
