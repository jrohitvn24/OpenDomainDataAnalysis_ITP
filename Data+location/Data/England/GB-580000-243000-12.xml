		<content>   They cast off the moorings and the  
 tiny{three-masted barque,}only 20m    
 long, sailed from Ipswich on the early
 tide. It was 8.0am the first day of   
 term, not{1606}when Captain Gosnold   
 and a crew of 13 set sail for{Virginia
 with 39 emigrants (how ever did they  
 squeeze in; live pigs and hens too!). 
 We departed for school (hardship) but 
 they were at sea for 5 months; trapped
 in the Channel by adverse wind for six
 weeks, they completed the{6000 mile   
 journey in April 1607 just in time to 
 sow their first crops. They were weak 
 from bad food, they caught{cholera and
{ague,}and almost 50% died by autumn,  
 the Captain among them. But survivors 
 did found the very first successful   
 English 'plantation' in the New World.
   P.S. The{replica Godspeed}did not   
 reach Jamestown by July; the Caribbean
{hurricane season}halted the voyage.   </content>
