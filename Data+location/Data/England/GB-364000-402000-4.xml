		<content>{     My Day by Judith Thomas Aged 9   
{                                      
{    }I get up at 7.35.  Dad makes us a
 drink then I dress and get my packed  
 lunch.  We go by car to Parklee       
 School.  The whistle goes and we line 
 up.  In school we do maths, then at   
 9.30 we watch Picture Box on T.V.     
 Assembly is at 10.00 then it's        
 playtime.  At 11.00 we watch Zig Zag  
 on T.V.  Lunch time is at 12.00.  We  
 come in at 1.10 for P.E.  After play  
 we do punctuation cards.  We have     
 recorder lessons at 3.10 and home time
 is at 3.30.  I walk to my nan's.  She 
 makes me coffee and I watch children's
 T.V.  My mum comes for me and we have 
 tea at home.  Later mum takes me to   
 brownies.  I go home at 8.00, watch   
 some T.V. then go to bed.
