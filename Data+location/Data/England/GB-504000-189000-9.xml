		<content> In 1938,as Europe prepared for war,   
 the strategic importance of sites to  
 the N.W. of London became obvious - in
 that they were less vulnerable to air 
 attack.Harefield House was one such   
 site and here was established the Test
 House for the Aeronautical Inspection 
 Directorate: this was later to be     
 known as the A.Q.D.                   
 The work done here for the last 48    
 years has been concerned with the     
 maintenance of the highest possible   
 standards of quality assurance        
 connected with military aircraft      
 procurement.                          
 All Q.A.Directorates have been        
 amalgamated under the Director General
 of Defence Quality Assurance and the  
 Harefield site is due for closure.This
 represents yet another loss of local  
 employment opportunity within this    
 rural area.                           </content>
