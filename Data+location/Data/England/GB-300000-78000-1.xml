		<title>01EXMOUTH COASTAL AREA</title>
		<content> The area is an interesting mixture of 
 sea coast, estuary head, mixed        
 farmland, residential and town centre.
 The farmland is mainly grassland and  
 crops (barley and wheat).             
 At the extreme eastern end of the     
 block is a massive chalet/caravan     
 holiday park, although it does not    
 intrude on the pleasant rolling       
 countryside due to certain planning   
 restrictions. Much of the income of   
 the area is derived from tourism.     
 There are a great many hotels and     
 guest houses offering family          
 accomadation, although little in the  
 way of entertainment apart from pubs, 
 amusement arcades, the Pavillion which
 has a stage and seats about 800 people
 and the Blackmore Theatre. There is no
 cinema. The area offers a variety of  
 sports; bowling, tennis cricket,      
 windsurfing and sailing.              </content>
