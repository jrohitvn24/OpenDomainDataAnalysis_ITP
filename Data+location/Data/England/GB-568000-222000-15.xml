		<title>15  BRAINTREE AUTO CLUB</title>
		<content>   Braintree Auto Club was formed 14   
 years ago. It has about 300 members   
 although not all of them race. There  
 are about 14 race meetings a year,with
 20 races. The track is 1/4 mile long. 
   Different formula cars have         
 different races. There are            
 850s,1300s,bangers and hot rods. All  
 of the cars except the hot rods are   
 allowed to hit other cars             
 deliberately. All of the cars have a  
 roll bar and the drivers wear a       
 special safety harness. There are very
 few serious accidents.                
   To start the race the marshalls wave
 a green flag. The commentater talks to
 the audience and it is very exciting. 
 At the end of the race the winner does
 a lap of honour. The last race is     
 always a novelty race - sometimes two 
 cars are joined together, or maybe    
 they race in a figure of 8!           </content>
