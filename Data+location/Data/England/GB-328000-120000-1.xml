		<content>     This is a rural area with mainly  
 dairy farming and a few small         
 industries. Many of the people who    
 live in the area work in local towns. 
   Hatch Beauchamp,the largest         
 settlement has a population of 384. It
 lies 6 miles outside Taunton, the     
 county town of Somerset. The main road
 through the village, the A358, is     
 being by_passed.                      
 The small Primary School has 45       
 pupils. The disused railway line runs 
 past the school. The local pub, called
 the Hatch Inn is being slightly       
 altered and has just changed          
 management. Near the medieval Parish  
 Church of St.John the Baptist,stands  
 Hatch Court, a fine mansion built of  
 Bathstone in the palladian style.     
 Beside this mansion is a deer park    
 with 31 deer including last year'     
 fawns.                                </content>
