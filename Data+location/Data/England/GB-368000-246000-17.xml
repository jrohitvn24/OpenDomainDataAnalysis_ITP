		<title>17Whitewell's Farm Cottages</title>
		<content>   Between 1978 and 1984 the old farm  
 buildings were converted into seven   
 luxurious{self catering cottages,}each
 with its own individual character. The
 hop kiln has circular rooms, and all  
 the cottages have exposed beams.      
   Lying on the A4103 it forms a good  
 base for exploring both the{Welsh     
{Borderland}and the{Severn Valley.} It 
 is open all the year.  A cottage costs
 about Â£80 a week in winter and up to  
 Â£225 in summer.  So far the scheme has
 been very successful and the cottages 
 are fully booked.  Although many      
 guests are british, there are also    
{foreign tourists,}especially          
 americans, africans and australians.  
   Most of the guests have been either 
 elderly people or couples with young  
 children who want a quiet holiday     
 centre.  They shop locally for food at
 Ridgeway Cross and Cradley.           </content>
