 THERE IS VERY LITTLE IN THE VILLAGE   
 OTHER THAN THAT WHICH THEY MAKE       
 THEMSELVES AND A GOOD DEAL OF         
 ENTERTAINING IS DONE IN THE HOME.     
 FOR THEATRE, CINEMA, DANCING ETC WE   
 HAVE TO TRAVEL TO OTHER PARTS OF THE  
 COUNTY TAKING CARE NOT TO INFRINGE THE
 DONT DRINK AND DRIVE LAWS.            
                                       
{RECREATION}                           
                                       
 THERE IS NO PLAYING FIELD AND NO      
 VILLAGE GREEN SO BOTH ADULTS AND      
 CHILDREN HAVE TO TRAVEL TO OTHER      
 VILLAGES TO JOIN IN SPORTS.   THERE   
 ARE FACILITIES IN BOTH SWAFFHAM AND   
 DEREHAM SIX MILES AWAY.
