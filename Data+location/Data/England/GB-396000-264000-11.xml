		<title>11The History Of Bentley</title>
		<content> The{local history}of Bentley begins   
 in 1332 when Bentley Pauncefoot was   
 established. There were two {manor    
{houses.}The most recent was built in  
 the first half of the 19th century.It 
 was bought by Mr Hemming in 1840. The 
 Squire (Maude Mary Hemming) was born  
 Dec.21st 1853. She married Mr         
 Greycheape and died  1919. She was    
 renowned for interest in the          
 Worcestershire{Hunt}. The Manor was   
 used for Italian and German prisoners 
 during the{Second World War}. It was  
 demolished in 1956 as it became too   
 expensive to maintain. The remains    
 were used to repair local{farms}and   
 cottages on the estate. The estate now
 belongs to the Squire's son, retired  
 in Scotlnd but is managed by his son  
 living in Haselor. Pheasants are now  
 bred on the site of the Manor.
