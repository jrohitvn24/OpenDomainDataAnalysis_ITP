		<title>13CUBBINGTON'S OWN CHRONICLER</title>
		<content>  Born in Cubbington in 1890, Gustavus 
 Peppitt was very much a local man. A  
 teacher and indeed ex headmaster of   
 the village school, he took the       
 greatest interest in the village, its 
 life and its people. He had a place on
 the Parish Council, was a founder     
 member of the Village Hall Trust, a   
 member of the Cubbington Players, a   
 trustee of Southerne's Charity and    
 much more.                            
  His greatest love was local history. 
 He hoarded photographs and documents, 
 he read all of the old village records
 and he recorded all of the village    
 people's doings. Finally his life's   
 work was published as 'Reflections of 
 Village Life from Domesday to 1970'.  
  His book is as fascinating as it is  
 authoritative. It is a grand memorial 
 to a man who has been described as    
 Cubbington's last 'Village Elder'.    </content>
