		<content> This area is mostly farmland and has  
 the usual selection of insects found  
 on pasture and grassland, such as     
 grasshoppers, beetles, flies, lady-   
 birds, ants, woodlice, spiders and    
 many others as well as dragonflies and
 mayflies down by the river. Although  
 several types of butterfly and moth   
 have become more scarce with the dis- 
 appearence of deciduous woodland and  
 replanting with conifers, there are   
 still many of the common ones to be   
 seen including Peacocks (inachis is), 
 Brimstones (gonepteryx rhamni), Red   
 Admirals (vanessa atalanta), Cabbage  
 White (pieridae) and the Elephant Hawk
 Moth (deilephila elpenor). There have 
 also been sightings of the rare Silver
 washed Fritillery (argynnis paphia),  
 White Admiral (limenitis camilla) and 
 Purple Emperor (apatura iris). All no-
 ted by Mr.Stephen Knight,a resident.  </content>
