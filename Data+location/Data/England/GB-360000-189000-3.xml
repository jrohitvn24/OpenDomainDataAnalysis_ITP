		<content>  9. Riddifords (Grocers) is the least 
     changed shop. It still delivers   
     for its customers.                
 10. The first car, 1906 was owned by  
     a Dr Salmon.                      
 11. Girl's school uniform used to be  
     gym slips, black stockings, laced 
     boots. Now no special uniform in  
     most junior schools. At the Castle
     Secondary School the girls wear   
     navy blue skirts and cardigans,   
     the boys grey trousers, grey      
     shirts and a blue and yellow      
     striped tie.                      
 12. A ducking stool was kept in the   
     goal which is now Worthingtons    
     (clothing shop).                  
 13. The population in the country area
     around Oldbury has remained the   
     same for at least 300 yr. Even    
     though there are more houses the  
     family sizes are smaller.         </content>
