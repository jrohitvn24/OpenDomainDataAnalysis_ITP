		<title>16West Wratting: Reminiscences</title>
		<content> It's easy to get our interviewee      
 reminiscing. He remembers passing the 
 blacksmith's forge on his way to the  
 village school and a couple of his    
 schoolfriends still live around. He's 
 got an invitation to the Over Sixties 
 Party in the village again this year  
 and is looking forward to the         
 entertainment which the Women's       
 Institute is rehersing. He'll meet his
 mates there, and if last year is      
 anything to go by, a jolly good time  
 will be had by all.
