		<title>16RECREATION IN PARR.</title>
		<content>      We went out into the streets near
 school   with   the   intention   of  
 interviewing  pedestrians and shoppers
 about the way they spent their leisure
 time.                                 
  1."Do you  think  the  council should
 spend more on  recreation  in  Parr?".
 All the  people  we  asked said "Yes".
  2."Do  you  think  the  facilities we
 have   are  any  good?".  One   person
 answered "Yes", six answered "No", and
 four  said  "Some  were", for  example
 Parr Swimming Pool.                   
  3."If there were  better  facilities,
 would  you  use  them?".  Eight  said 
 "Yes", two said "No", and one  replied
 "I don't think so."                   
  4."What  is  your  overall opinion of
 recreation in St.Helens?". One thought
 it was average, one  said it  was very
 poor,   the   rest   dismissed  it  as
 rubbish.                              </content>
