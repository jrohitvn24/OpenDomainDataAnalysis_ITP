		<title>17A DAY IN MY LIFE............</title>
		<content>  In the morning my sister Nicola comes
 in  to  me  to  wake  me up. I take no
 notice of her so she  goes in to  wake
 my mum up.     When I hear my mum up I
 shoot out  of bed.    When it is about
 half-eight I am ready to go to school.
 In school I go in to do the late book,
 then  come  back  to  class to do some
 work and then I go  downstairs to sell
 crisps.    At  twelve  o'clock  it  is
 dinnertime.   I go home for dinner and
 come back at a quarter to one.   We go
 in at one o'clock then we do some work
 and go out to play later on.   When we
 come in we do  some more work then  go
 home at half past three.  At home when
 I have eaten  my  tea  I  play out and
 come in at half past eight.  I have my
 supper,  watch T.V.,  and go to bed at
 half past nine.
