		<title>14THE PARK</title>
		<content> This centre of outdoor activities in  
 the middle of the village, was given  
 by{Mr.W.G. Foster}in 1922 and had     
 facilities for{bowls, putting, and    
{tennis}. When his son became 21 Mr.   
 Foster added ornamental gates and     
 boundary railings. Villagers provided 
 seats and trees and plaques indicating
 the donor's name.{Denholme Brass Band}
 frequently performed in the bandstand.
                                       
 The park is now used for bowls and    
 football. It also has a{war memorial} 
 grass for games, shrubberies,{a       
{childrens' playground}and{a BMX track}
                                       
{Kimberley says }When I go to the park 
 I sometimes take my BMX bike on the   
 BMX track. When I've had enough I go  
 on the swings and the gypsy caravan   
 slide.
