		<title>10FRATTON</title>
		<content>       Entertainment for me.           
      In Fratton the best places are   
{Fratton Park}Football Ground and the  
 library. There are some pubs in       
 Fratton including the Magpie, the     
 Jameson Arms, the Electric Arms and   
 the Unicorn.                          
      I think the most boring day is   
{Sunday}because not many people come   
 out to play but in the afternoon you  
 can play football or tennis.          
      The most enjoyable day in Fratton
 is a Saturday because you can go to   
 Fratton Park to see 'Pompey'_ a       
 Division Two{football}team playing.   
      There are lots of{shops}in       
 Fratton. The biggest one is the Co_op 
 where they have lots of computers and 
 computer games.                       
      The library in Fratton is called 
 the Carnegie and it is eighty years   
 old.                                  </content>
