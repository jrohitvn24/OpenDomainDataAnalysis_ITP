		<content> Walsall is a multi-faith community    
 with many religious buildings,        
 including Mandirs, Sikh temple,       
 Churches and Mosques.                 
 There has always been a Church above  
 Walsall on a limestone hill since     
 about 1200, now called St. Matthew's  
 and a new mosque centre is being built
 with separate ladies and men's rooms, 
 washrooms and toilets. The name of it 
 is Aryum-En-Ishate-Islam.             
 In our Junior School we did a survey  
 of how many of our children go to each
 different place of worship. The       
 results were: 100 Sikhs go to the     
 temple; 52 Muslims go to the mosque;  
 31 Hindus go to the Mandir; 17        
 Anglicans and 11 Methodists go to the 
 church; 4 others go to a place of     
 worship. In Walsall there is also an  
 inter-faith group which meets every   
 month to discuss different issues.    </content>
