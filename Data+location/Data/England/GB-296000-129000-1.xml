		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content> The area consists of farmland, mainly 
 pasture some of which has been        
 cultivated. Both cattle and sheep are 
 kept here. The fields are surrounded  
 by high hedges many on top of the     
 traditional Devon banks - soil banks  
 usually about a metre high. Some of   
 these hedges contain well developed   
 trees and there are small patches of  
 woodland. The roads in the area are   
 narrow and set deep between high      
 banks.                                
 In the west of this area is Wimbleball
 lake, a large reservoir administered  
 by the South West Water Authority. The
 roads near the lake have been improved
 to give easy access for tourists.     
 Buildings in the area consist mainly  
 of farmhouses with a few isolated     
 cottages. Some of these have been     
 modernised but many are in a bad state
 of repair and some are derelict.      </content>
