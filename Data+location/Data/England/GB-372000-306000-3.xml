		<title>03Town Council</title>
		<content>   She is the head of the town,        
 so she has to make decisions          
 concerning what's going to happen in  
 Shifnal.Every month ,she has to go to 
 a council meeting.She also goes to    
 visit schools.                        
      Some of the Mayors particular    
 concerns are litter,riding bikes on   
 the pavement, and playground abuse.   
    Repairs would cost Â£800,and in the 
 play area it is hard to find something
 that has not been vandalized.But worst
 of all what would happen if an elderly
 person was knocked over by somebody   
 riding on the pavement ?              
     Shifnal has also been trying to   
 get a swimming pool but sadly it was  
 turned down when it reached the Shire 
 Hall (county council).
