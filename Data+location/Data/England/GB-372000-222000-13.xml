		<content> PLODDY HOUSE - ARABLE FARMING         
 Ploddy House is another arable farm   
 typical of the area. It is 200 acres  
 in size and has been owned by the     
 Davison family for 21 years. When they
 bought the farm they paid Â£31,200.    
 Mr. Davisons day begins at 7.30 a.m.  
 when he gets up, has breakfast, reads 
 any post and the papers making a      
 special note of the weather over the  
 next few days. He checks to see what  
 his workers are planning to do that   
 day and then plans the next day. The  
 rest of his working day is spent      
 checking around the farm for any      
 problems, checking the crops for pests
 or diseases and as we discovered much 
 of his day is spent answering the     
 phone.
