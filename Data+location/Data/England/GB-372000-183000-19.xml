		<title>19Local History in Horton.</title>
		<content>       There are several items of Local
 history in and around the village of  
 Horton.The place name Horton is       
 derived from the old English name     
 "Horll" meaning mud which is likely to
 be associated with the nearby district
 of Kingswood.To the immediate east of 
 our survey area there are two Hill    
 Forts dating from the Iron Age.       
 Although not in our square they are   
 evidence of that early peoples settled
 in this area.The oldest house in      
 Horton is in Kings Lane and dates from
 the 14th century.Many of the other    
 houses in Horton and Little Sodbury   
 were built during the 19th century,   
 including the old manor house,Horton  
 Hall.Little Sodbury is well known for 
 the fact that William Tyndale lived   
 there.He brought out his first New    
 Testament in 1521.The chapel at Little
 Sodbury is named after him.           </content>
