		<content> THE LARGEST FARM IN OUR AREA IS       
 NAFFERTON,720 ACRES.LIKE MUCH OF THE  
 LOCAL FARMLAND IT IS OWNED BY LORD    
 ALLENDALE ,AND RENTED TO A TENANT,IN  
 THIS CASE NEWCASTLE UNIVERSITY.IT IS A
 FULL REPAIRING TENANCY WHICH MEANS    
 THAT ANY PROFITS GO TO THE            
 UNIVERSITY,AFTER EXPENDITURE ON       
 MAINTENANCE AND CAPITAL EQUIPMENT.IT  
 HAS 12 HOUSES,5 BEING USED BY FARM    
 STAFF,AND 1 BY A RETIRED WORKER.THE   
 WIDOW OF A FARMHAND IS ABLE TO STAY ON
 IN THE HOUSE UNTIL SHE ELECTS TO BE   
 RE_HOUSED ELSEWHERE.THE OTHER HOUSES  
 ARE USED ON A SHORT TERM BASIS BY     
 UNIVERSITY STAFF NEW TO THE AREA UNTIL
 THEY CAN  FIND PERMANENT ACCOMADATION.
 BECAUSE THERE ARE NO LOCAL SHOPS OR   
 PUBLIC TRANSPORT FROM THE FARM, RE_   
 HOUSING ELDERLY WORKERS IS GIVEN      
 PRIORITY BY THE COUNCIL WHO CAN       
 PROVIDE A HOME IN THE NEXT VILLAGE.   </content>
