 the coal face.My dad uses a machine,  
 the machine cuts the coal.My dad works
 with 13 more men.My dad catches the   
 bus to work.He works at Ireland       
 colliery.It is about 2\ miles away.He 
 doesn't like his job because it is    
 dirty,dusty and damp.He likes the     
 friendship and team work of the men.  
 He wears a helmet,shirt,trousers and  
 coat he also wears a battery on his   
 belt to which his cap lamp is attached
 by a length of cable.                 
 He also wears a self rescuer attached 
 to his belt that he takes with him,   
 incase there is a fire.By breathing   
 through it,it protects him from the   
 deadly gases.From the pit bottom to   
 the coal face it is 1 mile away.The   
 height of the coal face is 3 ft high.
