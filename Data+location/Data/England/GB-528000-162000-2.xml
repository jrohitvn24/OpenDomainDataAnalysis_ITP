		<content>Houses:The houses near our school are  
mostly detached or semi-detached. There
are no terrace houses or blocks of     
flats near our school, but there are   
new flats on the Brighton Road. Most of
the houses near our school are at least
50 years old. Many have new roofs and  
garages, plus large gardens.           
Travelling To School:Most children take
over 20 minutes to get to school;some  
take 5-10 minutes. Most children walk  
or take the bus;others by train or car.
Leisure:The possible leisure activities
are the cinema, local youth clubs and  
playing sport on the Purley Way        
recreation fields.
