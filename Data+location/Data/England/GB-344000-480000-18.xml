		<content> The Post Master at Storth assesses the
 population of the entire village at   
 700, with 200 receiving State         
 Retirement Pension and 200 Child      
 Allowance.                            
 He considers that owner-occupied      
 houses of the managerial/executive    
 kind dominate, together with          
 retirement homes. Workers travel      
 mainly to Kendal and Lancaster.       
 Unemployment is negligible, but young 
 people normally leave the village to  
 find work. The main source of         
 employment for men is the local       
 quarry. Approximately 18 persons are  
 employed with small traders or in the 
 hotels.                               
 The Post Office is also newsagent -   
 with the 'Daily Telegraph' having     
 major sales. A private car is almost  
 essential. The Arnside-Kendal bus     
 route is along the Promenade.         </content>
