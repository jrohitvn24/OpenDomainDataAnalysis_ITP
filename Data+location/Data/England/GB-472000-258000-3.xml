		<title>03THE EXPANSION OF NORTHAMPTON</title>
		<content>On the 19th June we visited BBC Radio  
Northampton to gather local news.They  
told us that fifteen years ago this was
a small market town of 100,000 people. 
Now it is a development town of 180,000
and still growing.The Government grants
allowed the expansion to take place but
these have come to an end this year.The
Development Corporation which was set  
up to manage these grants was disbanded
in April and responsibility handed back
to the Borough.Expansion is to continue
with the building of roads through Far 
Cotton to St.Peter's Way,Spencer Bridge
Road to the Weedon Road,Regent Square  
and Abington Street.New housing estates
are being built in the southern area   
all the way to the M1 Motorway.At the  
end of our visit we were given souvenir
pens,car stickers,badges and sticky    
bugs.Then we went along to see people  
at the Chronicle &amp; Echoe and the Post. </content>
