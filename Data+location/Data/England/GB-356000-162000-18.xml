		<content> The village is the centre for several 
 sporting activities with cricket in   
 the grounds of Chew Court, tennis at  
 the Sacred Heart Convent, badminton in
 the Church Hall and table tennis at   
 the Old Schoolroom. For the less      
 energetic there is a skittle alley at 
 the Queens Arms and another in a      
 worse state of repair at the Old      
 Schoolroom. Pub darts can be played at
 the Queens Arms and the Pelican and   
 fishing is available on the River     
 Chew and at Chew Magna Reservoir.     
 Villagers are also extremely fortunate
 to be able to use sporting facilities 
 at Chew Valley School which is home   
 ground for the squash, rugby,         
 badminton and hockey teams. Tennis is 
 also available at Chew Valley School  
 and for the lucky few there is a      
 swimming pool at both the school and  
 the convent.                          </content>
