		<title>14Games at School and Home 1</title>
		<content> Six people in our class did a survey  
 to see what games children like best. 
 Two looked at games children played   
 indoors at home. Two more looked at   
 games children played outdoors at home
 and two looked at playground games in 
 school. This is what they found out.  
                                       
 Our part of the survey was on games   
 children play indoors at home. We     
 found out that computers were the most
 popular, then it was Lego and third   
 was the pocket computers. Other games 
 children play at home include car     
 toys, Meccano, dolls, card            
 games, subbeteo football and chess.   
                                       
 We looked at games  children played   
 outside at home.The activity which    
 was themost popular was swimming.     
 Bicycling, football and roller        
 skating were also popular.            </content>
