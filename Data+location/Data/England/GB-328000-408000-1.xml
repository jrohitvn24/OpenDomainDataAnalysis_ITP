		<title>01Freshfield to Woodvale</title>
		<content> This diverse region in the county of  
{Merseyside}stretches from Freshfield  
 in the South to Woodvale in the North,
 from the Western coastline inland to  
 the moss-lands of the East.           
 Bisecting this region is the Liverpool
 to Southport railway. Freshfield      
 Station has been the focal point for  
 the growth of this dormitory village. 
 Also running through this region is   
 the A565. This dual-carriageway is the
 major road from Liverpool to Southport
 and beyond.                           
 To the east of this road, cattle and  
 sheep graze on the flat green fields. 
 To the west of this road lies Woodvale
 Aerodrome. Woodvale is not only an RAF
 base, but is also the centre for      
 recreational flying activities.       
 Further west the Nature Reserve is    
 home to many species, some endangered,
 of flora and fauna.                   </content>
