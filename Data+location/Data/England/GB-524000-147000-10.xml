		<title>10STRUCTURE PLAN S.REIGATE</title>
		<content>        "The Surrey Structure Plan pro-
 vides a framework for town and country
 planning in the County and is prepared
 by the County Council. Proposals for  
 the use of individual pieces of land  
 are made in a local plan by the Bor-  
 ough Council.                         
        London is surrounded by a "Gre-
 en Belt" which is meant to stop Lon_  
 don expanding into surrounding country
 -side,and prevent towns within the Gr-
 een Belt from merging into each other.
 Most of Surrey is in the Green Belt   
 and,outside the towns(in our area Rei-
 gate,Redhill and Salfords),only devel-
 opment concerned with farming or out- 
 door recreation is normally allowed.  
 In the towns building is allowed only 
 to meet the needs of local residents. 
 The Structure Plan contains policies  
 on how many buildings should be built,
 also for protecting our environment." </content>
