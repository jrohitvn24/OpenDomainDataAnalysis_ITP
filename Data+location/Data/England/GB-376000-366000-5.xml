		<content> The medical facilties of the area are 
 based at the Holmes Chapel Health     
 Centre which serves people who live   
 winthin 5 miles of it.  The building  
 which belongs to the Cheshire Area    
 Health Authority opened in 1973       
 replacing the doctors' previous       
 surgery in Dr. Picton's garden.  The  
 five doctors rent their surgeries and 
 other facilties from the C.A.H.A.     
 They also have to employ eight        
 receptionists and a nurse, as well as 
 providing equipment in excess of that 
 built into their rooms.  10,500       
 patients are registered with the      
 practice and 44 surgeries are held    
 each week.  15 different clinics are  
 held each week - anti-smoking, blood  
 pressure, speech therapy, etc.  These 
 are arranged by C.A.H.A.  Recently a  
 physiotherapy unit has been built and 
 equipped by voluntary donations.      </content>
