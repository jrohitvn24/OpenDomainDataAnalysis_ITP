   Nowadays the people living in our   
area rely on going into Ormskirk itself
or into Southport for entertainment.   
They go to the latter place for Bingo  
and the Cinema, and to both places for 
public houses, wine bars and           
restaurants, as there is only one cafe 
in our block, that being chiefly for   
the benefit of people in cars using the
main road, which is on the fringe of   
the area.                              
   One leisure activity which takes    
place in our area itself is motor bike 
scrambling and there are facilities for
pony trekking.                         
   Watching T.V. is the way in which   
most people spend their leisure time   
and a mobile library van caters for the
people who enjoy reading.
