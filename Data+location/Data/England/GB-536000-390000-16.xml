		<title>16NORTH COCKERINGTON SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The present school was built in 1860  
 but there has been one on the same    
 site since 1818. School records show  
 that in 1909 the average attendance   
 was 92! This is almost three times the
 number of pupils (31) on roll in 1985.
 The school is "Church Controlled" and 
 enjoys close contact with the local   
 C of E church, the vicar visiting the 
 school regularly.                     
 There are 2 classes, one for children 
 between the ages of 5 and 7, and the  
 other for children aged 7 to 11. At   
 the age of 11 children transfer to    
 High Schools in Louth.                
 There are 2 full time teaching staff, 
 one infant teacher and the head       
 teacher who is a full time teaching   
 head taking the junior class.
