		<content> An effort is being made to keep       
 Bexhill separated from Hastings &amp; St. 
 Leonard's by preserving a green belt  
 from Glyne Gap northwards.This is only
 one field's width at its south end,and
 building has encroached upon former   
 farmland in recent years.Pebsham Farm 
 is now closely overlooked by new      
 estates on its east side,and building 
 continues presently.Where sheep and   
 some horses now graze and oil seed    
 rape blooms in nearby fields the      
 network of residential roads threatens
 to cover more agricultural land.Around
 Combe Haven there is no development as
 it is so liable to flooding.Buses now 
 serve some of Pebsham,making it easier
 for residents to commute to and from  
 work.A suburb of Bexhill,the built-up 
 part of Pebsham is now about one tenth
 of the total area of the town.There   
 are mainly young people in Pebsham.   </content>
