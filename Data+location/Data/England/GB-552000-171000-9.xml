		<title>09LANDSCAPE - RIVER DARENT</title>
		<content> The River Darent, a gently flowing    
river in the area, is linked with many 
aspects of life. Its importance, now   
diminished, goes back to Roman times   
when the ford provided an ideal        
crossing point for the road from London
to Dover and gave rise to a settlement 
Darenthford (Dartford).                
 Along side the river in Dartford are  
the grounds of a private sports club   
and Central Park providing many general
services. The former mill races and    
channels have been upgraded to take    
excess water preventing Dartford from  
flooding.                              
 The river winds along the edge of the 
industrial estate, its only link with  
industry now being an historical one.  
Further south the river flows through  
farmland providing water meadows.Public
footpaths give access to the beauty of 
the countryside and river landscape.   </content>
