		<title>06Housing in Alresford.</title>
		<content> The traditional village of Alresford  
 used to be centred around the creek   
 and the 18th century hall, but the    
 development of an estate meant that   
 there was a complete change of com-   
 munity centre. The estate was built on
 heath land which was worthless agri-  
 culturally but the large incoming pop-
 ulation soon created its own problems.
 The estate completely changed the     
 nature of the village from a sleepy   
 curve in the river consisting of a few
 farms and farm workers into a thriving
 busy village, popular for both perman-
 ent residence and weekend activities. 
  In Alresford a total population of   
 2300 people live in 800 houses and it 
 has now been decided that there is to 
 be no further development. However,   
 there is still a huge demand for homes
 within the village, especially in the 
 Â£25-35000 range. There are no flats.  </content>
