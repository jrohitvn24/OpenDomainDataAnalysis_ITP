 In school children play {Cops and     
{Robbers, Skipping and British         
{Bulldogs.}To play Cops and Robbers    
 some people are on, they count and    
 chase the other people.  When they    
 catch them they take them back to the 
 den.  If someone runs to den and gets 
 through everyone is saved.  The boys  
 play{football.}The games are not rough
 they are played in the playground.  We
 do make up games of our own but we do 
 not mix the sexes as a general rule.  
{Push Ball}used to be played in        
 Pershore, a six foot diameter ball was
 made and pushed backwards and forwards
 by teams of five on each side on a    
 large field. Games tend to be seasonal
 in school much as other areas of      
 England.
