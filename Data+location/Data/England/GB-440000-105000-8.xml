		<content> The majority of buildings in this area
 are new - they were built in the last 
 30 years when Hythe began to develop. 
 Many of these are built of red brick  
 and have slanted roofs made of slate. 
 In the 50's and 60's the houses were  
 box shaped and uninteresting but now  
 efforts have been made to make them   
 look more attractive - for example    
 double glazing has been installed in  
 some houses. This makes the houses    
 soundproof and warmer. Some people    
 live in houses, some in bungalows.    
 Some are detached, some semi-detached 
 and some terraced. There are some     
 flats in the area. Most houses have   
 2-4 bedrooms, a kitchen, a bathroom   
 and a lounge. Some people think their 
 houses are too small so they have     
 extensions built. Most houses also    
 have gardens.                         
                                       </content>
