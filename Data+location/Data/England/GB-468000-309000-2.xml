 South Croxton it has changed over the 
 years.The people are younger now and  
 the actual village has changed. For

 have died. New young families now live
 in the village. They started farming  
 because it was passed down through the
 family. On their farm, the main crop  
 they grow is barley. The only animals 
 they have on the farm are cows. The
