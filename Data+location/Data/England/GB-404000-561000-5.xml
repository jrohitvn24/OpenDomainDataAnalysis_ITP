		<title>05LIVING IN MICKLEY</title>
		<content> I live in a 3 bedroom semi-detached   
 house. I have a brother aged 5 and two
 sisters 3 and 1. My Mammy used to be a
 Primary School teacher. My Daddy      
 teaches Physics in a High School.     
 I like making models with Lego,reading
 swimming, jogging and jumping around. 
 I have a BMX bike and a Raleigh Boxer.
 I like remote controlled cars but I   
 haven't any.                          
 We have a colour television but no    
 video or computer.                    
 Daddy plays cricket for Stocksfield   
 and sometimes we go to watch.         
 Every Sunday we go to Stocksfield     
 Baptist Church to worship Jesus.      
 On Saturdays we go shopping to Prudhoe
 and visit Grandma there. She is very  
 kind to us and makes apple pies which 
 I love.
