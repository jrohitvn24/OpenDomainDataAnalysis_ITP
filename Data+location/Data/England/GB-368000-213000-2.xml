		<content> In the centre of Westbury village,    
 stands the centuries old Preaching    
 Cross, the Doctor's surgery and the   
 Red Lion public house supplying all   
 from morning coffee to evening pints. 
 Down the lane facing the cottages is  
 the main entrance to the church of St 
 Mary, Peter &amp; Paul. By its side is the
 separate wooden shingle tiled steeple 
 of the bell tower with its eight bells
 and golden weather vane. The small    
 churchyard, now almost full, has a    
 Burial Ground nearby. In a niche in   
 the churchyard wall is a War Memorial 
 to the dead of two world wars. Two    
 kissing gates at the end of the wall  
 lead to another church entrance &amp; the 
 side of Westbury Court Home for the   
 Elderly &amp; eventually to the entrance  
 of Westbury Court Garden a water      
 garden laid out in the Dutch manner of
 1700, quite unique.                   </content>
