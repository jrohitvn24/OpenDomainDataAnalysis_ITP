		<content> The block has one{bus service,}run by 
 Barton's. This is the No. 12          
 single-decker between Nottingham and  
 Leicester, which runs hourly during   
 the week, two-hourly on Sundays, and  
 serves both Widmerpool and Wysall.    
 Both{village schools}having been      
 closed, the children (roughly 60 in   
 the area) must travel by bus from     
 Wysall to East Leake, Loughborough,   
 Nottingham, Costock or Keyworth, and  
 from Widmerpool to Willoughby         
 (primary) or Keyworth.                
 The{Plough Inn}in Wysall is about 300 
 years old. It is very popular with    
 outsiders but less so with village    
 people. It could be that the strong   
 Methodist tradition keeps many of the 
 villagers from the pub. Also no darts,
 dominoes or skittles teams exist,     
 which might attract local people. An  
 old plough hangs on the white wall.   </content>
