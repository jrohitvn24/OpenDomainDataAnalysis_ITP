		<title>01St Minver _ Amble Block</title>
		<content> Situated approximately 3km south of   
 the cliffs of{North Cornwall}and 3km  
 east of the broad estuary of the      
 River Camel, the land of this fertile 
 block, set in a countryside of mainly 
{gently sloping}hills and valleys, lies
 between the 95m contour and just above
 sea level. Apart from the north west  
 corner of the block, the{drainage}    
 pattern is towards the{River Camel}to 
 the south and towards its tributary   
 the River Amble in the east. Soils are
 of medium quality and only very small 
 parcels of land remain unreclaimed.   
 Levels of rainfall are surprisingly   
{low}for Cornwall. The{952mm isohyet}  
 passes close to St Minver village and 
 a rainfall station immediately south  
 of the block, for the years 1941_1970,
 reported 923mm per annum, with Nov Dec
 and Jan averaging around 100mm and Apr
 May and Jun between 50mm and 65mm.    </content>
