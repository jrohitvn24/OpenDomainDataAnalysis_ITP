		<content>      During the second world war,     
 Jersey was occupied by German troops. 
 The island was liberated on May 9th   
 1945. In 1985, forty years later, an  
 inscribed granite stone was placed in 
 a small raised garden at Trois Bois on
 the main road through the parish of   
 St. Lawrence, at a site which was     
 surrounded by German gun emplacements 
 during the war. The stone with its    
 inscription "to celebrate forty years 
 of peace" was dedicated on May 9th    
 1985. On July 5th 1985 a copper urn   
 was placed in a kist under the        
 Liberation Stone, containing money, a 
 news paper, list of names of all      
 children in the two parish schools,   
 St. Lawrence and Bel Royal, and other 
 items of local interest. Instructions 
 have been left for the urn to be      
 opened in the year 2045.
