		<title>19Traction Engine Rally</title>
		<content> In 1966 a Traction Engine Rally was   
 held in Camerton in order to raise    
 funds to renovate{St. Peter's church. 
 The rally was successful and          
 generated much interest so it was to  
 be repeated annually over the next 14 
 years, the last being held in 1980.   
 Sufficient{funds}were raised to       
 redecorate inside the church and      
 carpet throughout. The very long drive
 was relaid and the bells re-smelted.  
 Three local men, the brothers Goold   
 and Mr. Cleeves who had purchased an  
 engine at the time of the first rally 
 still restore and renovate them today.
