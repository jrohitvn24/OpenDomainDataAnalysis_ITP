		<title>15A Truck Driving Mum</title>
		<content> Ten years ago my mum was working for a
 firm called Warners Transport, driving
 a small 35 cwt.van. One day Mr.Warner 
 sent her to Hereford where there is   
 the Transport Training School.After 10
 days of lessons,Mum passed the test to
 get her Class One H.G.V. Licence. I   
 passed mine also, by proxy, because at
 that time my mum was expecting a baby,
 who turned out to be me. When I was 14
 months old, mum and I hit the road to 
 become full-time truck driver and     
 mate.We travelled all over the country
 and even went to Germany. Mum even    
 managed to potty train me in the      
 lorry,and used to read to me if we had
 to wait for loading and unloading.When
 I was 3, mum thought it was time for  
 me to go to playschool. So on         
 playschool days I stayed with Aunty   
 Hilary and went to school with        
 Rachael.                              </content>
