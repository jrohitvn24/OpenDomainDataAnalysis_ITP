		<title>09Community schools - 1.</title>
		<content>      We visited the two community     
 schools in our block and asked the    
 same questions at each.  Afterwards we
 compared the answers to see what was  
 the same about them and where they    
 differed.                             
      The ages of the people who use   
 the community school range from 2 to  
 90, and people seem to travel to the  
 nearest one.  More than twice as many 
 teachers work for the community school
 at Shevhngton as at Standish, and     
 they are able to offer twice as many  
 activities.  The two schools offer    
 completely different subjects in      
 which people can take public          
 examinations, except that             
 typewriting can be taken at both.     
 In each case all the school           
 buildings are used by the community   
 school.$
