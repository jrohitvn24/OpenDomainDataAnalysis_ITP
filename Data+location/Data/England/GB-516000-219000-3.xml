		<content> WATERCRESS BEDS                       
 The farm is situated on Lilley Bottom 
 Road.They call it Nine Wells.The      
 people who own it are D.Sansom and his
 two sons.                             
 At school we started a project about  
 the watercress beds.The people who are
 doing the project are Simon Sansom,   
 Andrew and me.Simon's dad works on the
 watercress beds with his              
 twin brother and father.It has been in
 his family for over one hundred and   
 fifty years.When the weather was fine 
 Simon Sansom,Andrew and I went down to
 the watercress beds to look at the    
 fresh watercress while we were waiting
 for Mrs.Sansom.It was very fresh.Then 
 we had a look at the boxes which the  
 watercress goes in and he showed us   
 how to fold them.Twenty bunches will  
 fit in a box and each bunch costs     
 twenty pence.                         </content>
