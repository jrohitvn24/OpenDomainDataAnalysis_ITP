		<content>   We hardly ever go to town because   
 where I live there are quite a lot of 
 shops.If we do go to town it is only  
 to buy furniture or toys.We buy most  
 of our food from the shops along      
{Walton Road.}There are a lot of food  
 shops but there are also a number of  
{derelict}shops.These should be knocked
 down and rebuilt but nobody bothers.We
 have a variety of shops:D.I.Y. shops, 
 fish and chip shops,newsagents and    
 others.There is one shop on{Walton    
{Road}where we go to buy our clothes.It
 sells other things apart from clothes:
 material,t.v. sets,sewing machines    
 etc.. I enjoy shopping in the area    
 because there are many interesting    
 shops to look at and the people are   
 often very helpful and friendly. We   
 often see the Barra ladies selling    
 fruit and veg. at the top of our      
 street.{(Joanne Windever)             </content>
