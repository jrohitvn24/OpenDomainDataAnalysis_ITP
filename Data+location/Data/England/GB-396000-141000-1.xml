  The area lies across rolling chalk   
 downland on the southern edge of      
 Salisbury Plain, and is used mainly   
 for agriculture. A winterbourne at a  
 mean elevation of 9O metres runs      
 through Chitterne in the north east to
 the centre of the southern edge. The  
 highest point of land is 168 metres.  
 Two of the farmhouses and 44 other    
 dwellings are within part of          
 Chitterne, a village bisected by the  
 northern edge of the boundary.The     
 total population of the village is    
 about 2OO, with a shop, church, pub,  
 small garage and a builder's business,
 although only the latter three are    
 situated in this area. The two other  
 farmhouses and the fish packaging     
 factory are accessible from the       
 Chitterne to Codford road, separate   
 from the village.                     </content>
