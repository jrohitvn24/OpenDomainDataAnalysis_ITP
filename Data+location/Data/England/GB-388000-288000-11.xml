		<content> Primarily this area is a residential }
 one. Over half of the land is occupied
 by houses. However, there are many    
 acres of land set aside for industry, 
 usually in the form of Trading        
 Estates. Chief amongst these is the   
{LCP Trading Estate}which was conceived
 in 1948 and is now one of the largest 
 managed estates in Europe. Here, in a 
 choice of properties,{three thousand  
{five hundred}people are employed, and 
 they do a variety of work from        
 warehousemen to{skilled craftsmen.    
 Another important source of employment
 is the{Midlands Electricity Board     
 which has a large office complex in   
 Kingswinford. Here,{six hundred people
 are employed to deal with the         
 electricity accounts for the whole    
 Midlands area.                        
 Generally employment is fairly good.
