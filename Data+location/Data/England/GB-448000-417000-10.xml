		<title>10LIFE IN WENTBRIDGE-WENTHILLS</title>
		<content>    Most of the people who live in     
 Wentbridge have chosen to do so       
 because they want to enjoy the peace  
 of the countryside around and at the  
 same time to be able to get to the    
 places where they work. It is the sort
 of place where many people would like 
 to live, so the houses there are very 
 expensive. There are no council houses
 in the area at all.                   
    Wentbridge does not have its own   
 school. The school closed down many   
 years ago. There are hardly any       
 children living in Wentbridge. There  
 is a playgroup for children under     
 school age.                           
    There are good facilities for      
 eating out, but no other centres for  
 activities.                           
    Wentbridge has its own church,     
 built by a resident, but comes under  
 the Darrington Parish.                </content>
