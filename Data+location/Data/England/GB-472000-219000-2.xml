		<content>The church of Holy Cross and Saint Mary
stands on the east side of the village.
Visitors come to see its monuments and 
brasses.One of the latter is one of the
earliest to depict a woman.Parts of the
church date back to 1350.              
    The vicars name is Mr.Hemsley.He   
has been at Quainton for 10 years.He   
only spends half his time in Quainton  
because he works at other   village    
churches as well.He also visits   sick 
people and takes school assemblies.His 
favourite job is taking   family       
services but he enjoys other services  
too.He has done 100     christenings   
since coming to   Quainton.Once there  
were 315 people in   the church for a  
confirmation service taken    by the   
bishop.
