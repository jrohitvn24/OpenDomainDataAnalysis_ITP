		<title>18AROUND HILLDALE FARMS</title>
		<content>    In Scissett their used to be a     
 large number of wool mills but in the 
 last few years they have been closing 
 down.                                 
 Hilldale farms bought a wool factory  
 in 1980 for a dairy and other mills   
 have just been left for sale if any   
 one wants them. Some factories are    
 still at work. They are'nt all wool   
 mills. Some produce engineering       
 products and other small products.    
 Most of Scissett used to be farmland  
 but some shops and houses have been   
 built on the land. There are quite    
 a few left up on the hilly tops. Some 
 farms up there are one hundred years  
 old or more. Most houses and farms are
 built of stone. The farms in the area 
 are isolated. Most parts of our block 
 are hills,countryside and woodland.   
 Most of the farmland is grassed       
 fields.                               </content>
