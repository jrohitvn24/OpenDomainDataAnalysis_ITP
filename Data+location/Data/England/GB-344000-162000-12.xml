		<content> THERE ARE THREE MAIN TYPES OF         
 AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITY IN THE BLOCK,   
 ALL RELATED TO THE GEOLOGY AND        
 LANDSCAPE.                            
 ON EITHER SIDE OF THE RIVER YEO ON THE
 FLAT LOW-LYING LAND CATTLE ARE REARED 
 ON THE RICH PASTURE.                  
 ON EITHER SIDE OF THAT AREA THERE IS A
 MIXTURE OF ROUGH AND CULTIVATED       
 GRASSLAND WITH A SMALL AMOUNT OF      
 ARABLE CULTIVATION. THIS AREA IS ALSO 
 MARKED BY ITS THICK HEDGEROWS AND     
 OCCASIONAL CLUMPS OF TREES            
 TO THE NORTH, FRINGING THE WOODLAND   
 AND SOMETIMES IN WOODLAND CLEARINGS   
 THERE IS MORE ARABLE CULTIVATION, BUT 
 STILL A PREDOMINANCE OF PASTURE AND   
 CATTLE. JUDGING FROM THE NUMBER OF    
 EXPENSIVE CARS IN THE FARMYARDS IT    
 MUST BE REASONABLY PROFITABLE TO FARM 
 THE AREA.                             
                                       </content>
