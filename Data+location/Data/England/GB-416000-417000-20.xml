		<content>{Hopton}is situated on the {river      
{Calder.}It is not a particularly      
 attractive area, most of the houses   
 are back to back terraces, built to   
 house workers in the woollen mills of 
 the area. Most of these are now closed
 the old mill buildings now house{new  
{service industries}e.g.  car service  
 firms, pallet makers and offices. The 
 area has a neglected air, although    
 there are signs of improvement. The   
 river, which was{polluted}by          
 industrial waste, is gradually        
 becoming cleaner. Some of the houses  
 are being modernised and the streets  
 re-surfaced. The{school}has a         
 nursery unit and is lOO years         
 old.There is a {Reading and Language  
{Centre}which is used by teachers in   
 the Kirklees Authority. The people    
 would like better roads, pavements and
 street lighting.                      </content>
