 Mr. &amp; Mrs. P. Hibbard in the premises 
 previously used as the Primary School.
 The Hibbards came to Middleham in     
 1981.   Peter Hibbard is a sculptor   
 who enjoys working with alabaster. He 
 also draws, paints and makes          
 furniture.   The building is run as an
 art gallery, bookshop and snack-bar   
 and people come for art courses and   
 holidays.   Approx 228 people visit   
 the gallery each week. An exhibition  
 of batik pictures painted by the head-
 master of the Primary School was held 
 in June.   Mr.Hibbard was in charge of
 the Middleham Festival in 1983 ; is   
 vice chairman of the Cricket Club and

 see the Old Town Hall made into a     
 Community Centre.
