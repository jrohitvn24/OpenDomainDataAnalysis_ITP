		<content>    Our school dinners come in tins.   
 Today it is beefburgers, chips and    
 sweetcorn with Swiss buns and milk    
 shake for pudding. At dinner the three
 classes are mixed up. When the plates 
 are cleared away, one of us reads out 
 tomorrow's menu. You get to do that if
 you have a birthday(or your Mum does).
{  We play outside on the grass or the 
{playing field if it's fine. In the    
{afternoon lessons we sometimes have   
{Games, P.E. or Drama.}                
   At 3.15 we go home. I change and go 
 out to play with my friends. We go    
 down to the woods where our camp is.  
 We clear away some dead leaves from   
 the pond near our camp before tea.    
{  Then I watch television or play a   
{game. Sometimes I read my Pony comic  
{and put on the cassette recorder until
{it is time to go to bed at 9 o'clock, 
{and that's the end of another day.    </content>
