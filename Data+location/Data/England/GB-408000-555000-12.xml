		<content> Although Ebchester is a small village 
 there are activities for young and    
 old.Atoddler group,Youth Club,        
 Discotheques,Old Peoples Lunches      
 etc.The local churches,one C.OFE.and  
 one METHODIST both have sunday schools
 as well as a Mother's Union.Alarge    
 number of local residents belong to a 
 Leek Club and take great pride in     
 growing healthy and large leeks.      
    The Village Trust and the Community
 Association play a very active part in
 village life.They not only provide    
 entertainments,but watch over village 
 property and surroundings.This latter 
 job is very important as Ebchester    
 sits amid some beautiful countryside  
 which needs to be protected and       
 preserve.There are a number of        
 enjoyable walks in and around the     
 village.
