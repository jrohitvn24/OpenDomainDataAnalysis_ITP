		<title>07A Newcomer in Alveston</title>
		<content> I used to live in Heywood just outside
 Manchester. Heywood is quite a large  
 place.Some of Heywood is a bit grotty 
 and vandalised.Alot of heavy goods    
 travel on the main road.Before we     
 moved here we had a look at the       
 secondary schools and catchment       
 areas.My mum and dad decided that we  
 would move here because they thought  
 Marlwood was quite a good school and  
 they liked Alveston.I felt a bit      
 strange at first leaving my old school
 and friends and finding new friends   
 but I soon settled in.Heywood is      
 bigger than Alveston and both have    
 hardly any industrial development .   
 There are more small shops, youth     
 clubs and scout packs in Heywood but  
 we had to travel in the car to go on  
 country side walks, where as in       
 Alveston you don't have to.
