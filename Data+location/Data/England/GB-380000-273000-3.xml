		<content> In our area we have the West Midlands 
 Safari Park. You can either go in a   
 car to see the animals or just walk   
 around and have a go on the rides. The
 animals can roam around freely in     
 their part of the Safari Park, except 
 for the lions, who have a wire fence  
 around them.                          
 In the Park there are monkeys,        
 lions, elephants, rhinoceros,         
 giraffes, tigers, hippos and horses.  
 With some of the less dangerous       
 animals you can open your car windows 
 but with monkeys in particular they   
 must remain shut because they can be  
 very vicious.                         
 Another part of the Park has a        
 fairground, eating facilities and a   
 pets corner. During the afternoon     
 there are sea lions shows.            
                                       
                                       </content>
