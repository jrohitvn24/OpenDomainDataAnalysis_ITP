		<content> Several of the children who attend the
 St.Levan Primary School are from      
 families employed by the Cable and    
 Wireless Company at Porthcurno.The    
 beaches from Sennen Cove around to    
 Porthcurno have seen more telephone   
 and telegraph cable landings than any 
 other area in the world.At one time,  
 between the wars,all overseas tele-   
 graph traffic circulating to and from 
 London over the Commonwealth cable    
 system passed through Porthcurno amou-
 nting to some two million words per   
 day.Commercial telegraph operations   
 ceased at Porthcurno in 1970.However  
 Cable and Wireless happily maintains  
 an extensive technical training coll- 
 ege here which forms part of the local
 social and sporting scene.Cable oper- 
 ators and engineers from all over the 
 world have trained here.
