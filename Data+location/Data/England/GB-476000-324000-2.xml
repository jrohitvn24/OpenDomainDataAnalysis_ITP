		<content> Scalford is a busy, but pretty        
 Conservation village some 7 kilometres
 from Melton Mowbray.St Egelwin's is   
 the only church dedicated to him in   
 England. The name Scalford shows there
 was once a ford here. There is still  
 an underground stream,which is now    
 channelled to a tap by the road called
 The Spout.This was restored in 1977   
 for Queen Elizabeth's Silver Jubilee. 
 People now use the water for cars and 
 gardens.                              
    The village has four shops, two    
 general food stores, a bakery shop and
 the post office which also sells      
 newspapers and groceries.There are two
 pubs, the Plough and several small    
 businesses, including a creamery.     
   Many of the houses are quite old and
 built of ironstone or Scalford brick, 
 now no longer made, but there are some
 modern brick built houses.            </content>
