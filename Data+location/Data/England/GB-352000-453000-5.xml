		<title>05OVER WYRESDALE:SHEEP FARMING</title>
		<content>    The importance of sheep farming in 
 this area is reflected in the name    
 given to the church in Over Wyresdale 
 -'the Shepherds' Church'. Practically 
 every farm here keeps sheep as a      
 secondary enterprise to dairy or beef 
 farming. The most popular breeds are  
 'mules' which predominate on the lower
 slopes where the land is richer,      
 'mashams' on the higher pastures and  
 horned sheep which are kept on the    
 fells. Mashams are a cross between    
 Dalesbred and Teeswaters, and mules   
 between blue-faced Leicesters and     
 Swaledales. Both are crossed with     
 terminal sires like Suffolks or Texals
 to produce fat lambs for market in    
 Lancaster. Lambing starts in February 
 on the lower farms and the first lambs
 are sold in early April. There is one 
 registered pedigree flock in this area
  - Suffolks - kept at Knowsley Farm.  </content>
