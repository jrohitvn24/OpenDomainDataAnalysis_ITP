		<content>{St Mary's Church Rushden} stands on a 
rise in the ground at the southern end 
of the High Street. The present church 
was built on the site of another church
which was mentioned in the Domesday    
Book.This was discovered when a wall of
the old church was found during the re-
laying of some floorboards.In the      
church is found the Pemberton Chapel   
which contains two recently restored   
monuments to the Pemberton family.The  
medieval windows date back to 1450.    
There are five full-stained and four   
half-stained.{St Katharine's Church,   
Irchester} was first mentioned in 1105 
when it belonged to a Cluniac Priory.  
The church has been remodelled at var- 
ious times and some of the old doorways
have been blocked off.The fine spire   
has recently been repaired.The tower is
built of two types of coloured stones  
which give it a striped appearance.    </content>
