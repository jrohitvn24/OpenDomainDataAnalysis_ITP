 This was once an old watermill but is 
 now used as a sterilization and       
 re_cycling plant for animal           
 remains.The works stands by an old and
 very narrow stone bridge,which creates
 many problems because very heavy      
 lorries frequently leave the works and
 often there are traffic jams.One other
 great problem is the very strong and  
 unpleasant smell which the factory    
 produces.This drifts down the valley  
 and people can smell it for miles     
 around.The river splits into two      
 channels at Ditchford and sometimes   
 floods.
