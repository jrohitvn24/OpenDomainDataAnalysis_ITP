  Most of the villagers whom we        
 interviewed told us that they had     
 retired to Brook because it was       
 peaceful.Although it seems that       
 there is little to do the elderly     
 people enjoy the{beautiful country    
{walks}that are available to           
 them,however transport is essential as
 the nearest town is four miles        
 away.Fortunately there are{three bus  
{routes}travelling through Brook that  
 can take the locals to{Freshwater,}   
{Newport}and {Ventnor.}                
   The village, unspoiled by modern day
 pollutions,provides{picturesque       
{scenery}for the few tourists that     
 visit Brook and also for the locals   
 who inhabit this area.
