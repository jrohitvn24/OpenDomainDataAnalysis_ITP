		<title>04OLD PEOPLE &amp; SPARE TIME</title>
		<content> We went up to Somerset Court in       
 Cheveley where many old people live   
 We asked them what they did in their  
 spare time. There is a community room 
 where many of them like to play bingo 
 and a card game called whist. They    
 also play two other card games-beany  
 and sevens. Some said they liked      
 dominoes because it helped them to use
 their fingers. Some like to sing      
 around the piano, and if it is hot    
 they like to go to the pub for a      
 drink.                                
 We do different things in our spare   
 time-most of us watch TV, and like to 
 play on our bikes. Most of the girls  
 in the class have big stuffed animals 
 to play with, and most of us like to  
 play with our pets. Fiona likes to let
 out her geese over the garden because 
 they chase her.
