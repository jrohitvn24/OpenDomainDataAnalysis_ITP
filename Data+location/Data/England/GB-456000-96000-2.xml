		<content>      When invesigating our 'D' block  
 wefound much evidence of the Stokes   
 Bay Lines. These fortifications were  
 constructed by the Royal Engineers    
 under the instruction of Lord         
 Palmerston.                           
      This line was constructed to     
 linkthe Elson-Gomer line of forts with
 the Blockhouse-Monckton-Gilkicker     
 Forts.                                
      A moat extended from Fort        
 Monckton to the rear of Browndown     
 Battery in front of Fort Gomer, a     
 distance of some 2,700 yards.         
      The north west boundary of our   
 'D' block is formed by the wall of Bay
 House, once the home of Lord Ashburton
 and is now a comprehensive school.
