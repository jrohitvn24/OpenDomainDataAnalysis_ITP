 Served by the railway until 1953, then
 replaced by a service of buses,       
 Stanhoe was finally deprived of all   
 its public transport five years ago.  
 A private coach runs through the      
 village from Wells to King's Lynn on  
 Tuesdays and Saturdays (market days). 
 Under a self-help scheme, a mini-bus  
 manned entirely by volunteers is      
 provided to help fill the gap and     
 started about three years ago, plies  
 between four neighbouring villages,   
 connecting with service buses to      
 King's Lynn, Heacham, Hunstanton and  
 Fakenham.  It also goes to Burnham    
 Market twice a week.  It is based in  
 Docking and is available for private  
 hire, especially for clubs and        
 outings.
