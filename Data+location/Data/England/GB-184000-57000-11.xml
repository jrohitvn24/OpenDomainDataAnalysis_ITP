 After we had looked around the house, 
 we went inside the barn. Inside is an 
 exhibition of lawn-mowers.After we    
 went to the shop, then we went to the 
 cafe and had some tea. They sold      
 drinks and lots of things to eat.On   
 the back lawn they had lime trees,    
 which are not common in Cornwall. In  
 the orchard there are lots of apple   
 trees, plum trees and some other      
 trees.                                
 In the Front Court, at the side of    
 the path, are two stone lions.        
                                       
           {* * * * *
