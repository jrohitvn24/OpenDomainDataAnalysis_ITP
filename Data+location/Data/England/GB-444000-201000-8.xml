		<content>      The  road  out  of  Cumnor  has a
 single  row of houses along it.  These
 were   built   in   the  1930's-ribbon
 development   being  typical  of  that
 decade.  In 1958,  several houses were
 built  in  a  space  between the older
 houses.                               
      The garage mechanic who has lived
 at  Cutts  End  for 16 years said that
 apart  from  extensions  to  the backs
 of  some  houses there has been no new
 building during that time.  One family
 had   great  difficulty  in  obtaining
{planning permission}to build along the
 line of the road.  One resident feared
 that  the  Green  Belt is slowly being
 eroded   and   that  eventually  urban
 development   will   spread  out  from
 Oxford and swamp Cumnor.
