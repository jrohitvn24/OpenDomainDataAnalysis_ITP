		<title>04Roman Influence in Coddenham</title>
		<content> It is said that men have been active  
 in the landscape of Coddenham and     
 Hemingstone for a very long time. The 
 first farmers were 3,700 years ago in 
 the Bronze Age. The Roman town of     
 Combretonium stood slightly to the    
 west of this block. Many Roman and    
 Ancient British roads radiated out    
 from this centre and Roman roads cross
 Shrubland Park Estate and coins of the
 Emperor Constantine have been found   
 there. The name of "Shrubland" comes  
 from the Saxon word Scrobe or Scrybe, 
 meaning "Shrub" an indication of the  
 light porous nature of the soil.      
 Coddenham was mentioned in Domesday   
 Book and the name probably was derived
 from the Anglo-Saxon "Coda's Estate". 
 It was shown as a flourishing township
 with 75 houses and nearly 400         
 inhabitants. Coddenham and surrounding
 area has remained rich and prosperous.</content>
