		<title>10PATHS AND BRIDLEWAYS</title>
		<content>    In an area where {COMMUNICATION} is
 limited to a few lanes and narrow main
 roads,{FOOTPATHS} and {BRIDLEWAYS}    
 have served an important function in  
 the past. Interviews with elderly     
 residents in {Avening}have shown that 
 the many paths which criss-cross the  
 area have interesting histories.      
    One path at Pound Hill was the site
 of the former pack-horse trail for the
 woollen trade. Other paths running    
 towards the Church, have been used by 
 church-goers over the centuries. The  
 wider paths were used by pony and trap
 and other forms of wheeled{TRANSPORT. 
   Roundabout Lane, which was once a   
 farm track for waggons and hay wains  
 is today a narrow path, almost        
 overgrown in parts. The conditions of 
 these paths vary from those which are 
 stony, dry and clear of vegetation, to
 those which are barely passable.      </content>
