		<title>18How Nuneaton has changed (1)</title>
		<content> My Nan has known Nuneaton for 60      
 years.                                
                                       
 The Newdigate Arms Hotel was like an  
 entrance into the town.The streets    
 were narrower and Abbey Street was    
 houses instead of the shops of today. 
 All of the shops were much smaller.   
 W.H.Smiths was where Debenhams is now 
 and instead of the large Co-op there  
 were small,individual shops.Next to   
 the Co-op was the Gas Works.This has  
 now been demolished and became the    
 first car park in the town centre,    
 although you could park your          
 car wherever you wanted to then.      
 There was a chapel at the corner of   
 Stratford Street and Abbey Street,and 
 the Fire Station and Library were next
 to each other in Queens Road.
