 In our school there are 3 teachers and
 28 children. School lasts from 9 a.m. 
 to 3-30 p.m. The school is quite      
 small, and inside there is a big room 
 and a little room. The building is    
 about 105 years old. We have a garden 
 with a bit of grass where we sometimes
 play. Also we have two playgrounds,   
 one for the infants and one for the   
 juniors. At school we have a clerical 
 assistant and a dinner lady. Sometimes
 the boys play football and rounders at
 the playing field, and the girls stay 
 at school and have drama. At Christmas
 we have a party and we play games and 
 have tea.
