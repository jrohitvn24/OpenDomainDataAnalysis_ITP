		<title>02Local news, Stickney.</title>
		<content>  Stickney village doesn't have a local
 newspaper.All the news goes into the  
 Lincolnshire Boston Standard.It is put
 into one group by a lady who lives on 
 Main Road,Stickney,Boston.Some of the 
 news is about the Womens Institute    
 general meeting's.The W.I. is a       
 group of women who get together and   
 discuss things privately.             
  Other news is about events that are  
 held in the village hall like car boot
 sales. The things that go on at the   
 car boot sale are similar to a jumble 
 sale.All you have to do is put the    
 things in your car boot and take them 
 to the field where it is held and sell
 them.That's why it is called a car    
 boot sale.Also there is school        
 news.Just lately the school has been  
 in the newspaper about making clay    
 pots.
