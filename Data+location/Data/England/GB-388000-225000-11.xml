		<title>11River Chelt: survey</title>
		<content>  We tested the River Chelt for speed, 
 hardness of the water, its acidity,and
 the plant life on the banks.{         
  .                                    
 The River Chelt is quite a fast       
 flowing,to be precise 1.2m per second.
 Some parts of it is deep,and where it 
 is shallow,we can see that the bottom 
 is stoney and muddy. The colour of the
 water is slightly brown, but clear,and
 is hard. We tested the pH and found   
 that it was pH9,alkaline.We think this
 is caused by the water running through
 agricltural land, picking up          
 fertilizer. The banks are steep with  
 vegetation growing up the sides such  
 as:Sycamore,Elderberry,Willow,Hawthorn
 ,Nettles,Goosegrass etc.              
   The Seven-Trent Water Authority     
 visit daily to measure the height of  
 the water,which the day we went was   
 0.5m,and also the water.              </content>
