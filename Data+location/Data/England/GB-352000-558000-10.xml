		<content> The Gelt Woods are a favourite place  
 for walking. As well as local people, 
 many visitors to the area enjoy this  
 amenity.                              
 Another well used walk is the 'Dandy' 
 where the railway lines were lifted   
 after the track between Brampton      
 Junction and the town was no longer   
 used.                                 
 There are a few houses without a      
 garden. Most of them a well kept and  
 have a good variety of flowers and    
 shrubs.                               
 The allotments just off the Warwick   
 Road are well used for the growing of 
 vegetables.                           
 Leek growing for show in competition  
 is very popular in this area.
