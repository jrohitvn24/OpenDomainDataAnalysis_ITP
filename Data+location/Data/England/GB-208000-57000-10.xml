		<title>10RECREATION</title>
		<content>  The people of{Lostwithiel}have       
 found their recreation in gardening,  
 walking, the river, and in membership 
 of various clubs and societies.       
   The pattern is changing as people   
 now use the{Community Centre}where a  
 number of sports facilities are       
 available.   It is noticeable that    
 fewer people over the age of thirty   
 years are to be found in the public   
 houses and this is partly due to the  
 price of alcohol, the noise of the    
 juke box, and the awareness that if   
 one enters a public house there is    
 often no one with whom one is         
 familiar.                             
   The{Social Club}is an exception and 
 one can always find some one with whom
 one is familiar.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
