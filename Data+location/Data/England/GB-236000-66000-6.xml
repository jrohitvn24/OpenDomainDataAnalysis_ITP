		<title>06Westcott Farm History</title>
		<content>   The farm is recorded in the original
 Doomsday survey. There is a neolithic 
 henge, now a registered{ancient       
{monument},near the farmhouse, thus    
 indicating farming has existed on this
 site for the last 5000 years.         
   One of the disused outbuildings     
 contains a recently restored{cider}   
 press. As Mr.Hambly's family have     
 owned the farm since 1830 he was able 
 to explain that the press produced    
 cider for the family and the          
 farmworkers during the whole of the{  
{nineteenth century}and probably before
 that.                                 
   After renovation five years ago this
 one-horse-powered press has produced  
 several barrels of cider.             
   Part of Mr.Hambly's spare time is   
 taken up with the duties of being the 
{Portreave}of Callington.
