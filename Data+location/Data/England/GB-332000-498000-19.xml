		<content> Many farmhouses and cottages date back
 to the 17th century. Inside, special  
 features can still be found; slate    
 floors, oak panelling, doors and      
 floorboards in oak as well, and spice 
 cupboards built into the thick stone  
 walls, always next to the fireplace to
 keep things dry. Outside the walls    
 were rendered with thick rubble stone 
 not dressed, plastered over and       
 limewashed, a very effective way of   
 keeping out draughts.                 
 This is a typical lakeland area with  
 forestry, farming, bracken covered    
 fells and small tarns. Hawkshead is a 
 compact village, and Colthouse,       
 Outgate and Hawkshead Hill are three  
 hamlets of equal charm. Tarn Hows is a
 well known beauty spot set amongst the
 higher fells with breathtaking views. 
 It was visited by Queen Elizabeth II  
 this year.                            </content>
