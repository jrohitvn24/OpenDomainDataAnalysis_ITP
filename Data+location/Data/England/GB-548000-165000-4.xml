		<content> from many ailments                    
 Today, many of the old houses have    
 either been knocked down and new      
 houses built on the site or their     
 roles have been changed (eg Highcroft 
 Hall on page 17).  This infilling has 
 increased the population and density  
 of the village.  Socially the village 
 has changed and the standard of living
 is much higher.  The workers cottages 
 are now sought after properties and   
 the owners like the majority of the   
 people who live in the village work   
 either in London or nearby towns.  The
 farms employ only 1 or 2 workers and  
 have changed from fruit and vegetable 
 growing to extensive cereal production
 and most of the tasks are carried out 
 by machines (see pages 10 and 11 on   
 working farms).  Although Crockenhill 
 has changed it still retains much of  
 its village atmosphere.               </content>
