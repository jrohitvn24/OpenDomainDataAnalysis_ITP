		<content>      THE MAIN FOOD SHOP IN MILVERTON  
 IS SPAR. IT SELLS FOOD, SWEETS,       
 CLOTHES, VIDEOS AND TOYS. IT IS VERY  
 BIG FOR A VILLAGE SHOP. IT HAS JUST   
 BEEN PAINTED WITH BRIGHT, WHITE PAINT,
 AND LOOKS VERY LIGHT AND CHEERFUL     
 INSIDE. IT IS OPEN FROM 8.00 AM. UNTIL
 9.00 PM SIX DAYS A WEEK. WE           
 INTERVIEWED SOME OF THE CUSTOMERS.    
 WHEN WE WERE THERE FOUR MOTHERS CAME  
 INTO THE SHOP WITH LITTLE CHILDREN IN 
 15 MINUTES. THEY COME TO SPAR FOR     
 LITTLE THINGS BUT GO TO TAUNTON FOR   
 MOST OF THEIR FOOD.                   
                                       
      IN OAKE VILLAGE THERE IS ONLY ONE
 SHOP. IT IS THE POST OFFICE. IT SELLS 
 SWEETS, STAMPS, FOOD, SEEDS, TOYS AND 
 ICE CREAMS. MOST OF THE MUMS GO TO    
 TAUNTON FOR THEIR FOOD BECAUSE THE    
 SHOP IS SO SMALL. THE POST OFFICE HAS 
 A SMALL GARDEN FULL OF ROSES.         </content>
