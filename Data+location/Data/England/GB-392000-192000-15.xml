		<title>15CRUDWELL FARM -TYPICAL DAY</title>
		<content> The{farmers}in our area{work long days
{and are dependent on the weather.}This
 account of a typical farm day shows   
 this:Forecast, Sat.July 13th 1985,fine
 and hot with evening thunderstorms.   
 With{a field of hay to be baled}a     
 hectic day faced the farmers.Milking, 
 feeding and machinery checks were done
 by 9am.Two trailers were put in       
 position for a man to load with the   
 400 bales already in the field.The    
 other farmer teds the hay.Baling      
 starts at 1pm,a friend helps to unload
 and reload the trailers.A neighbour's 
 trailer was commandeered as 7 would be
 insufficient for the{estimated 1,000  
{bales.}Rain started at 7pm but work   
 continued as the bales would be ruined
 if left in the field.{At 10pm the last
{trailer is put under cover}and evening
 milking and feeding completed.Tea time
 at last!                              </content>
