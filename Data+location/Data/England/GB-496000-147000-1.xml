		<title>01S.W.GUILDFORD:GENERAL SURVEY</title>
		<content>  The area consists mainly of farmland.
 In this rural area are few major roads
 but many paths, including the long    
 distance path, the North Downs Way.   
 The town of Guildford, however, is    
 linked with London and Winchester by  
 the A3 and A31 roads respectively.    
  There are many historic buildings in 
 Guildford and its surroundings        
 including the 12th century castle,    
 17th century Guildhall and other fine 
 buildings _ especially churches _ in  
 and around the High Street. Loseley   
 House, outside the town, is open to   
 the public and exports dairy produce  
 countrywide.                          
  Guildford is a prosperous social and 
 commercial centre, while remaining a  
 beautiful town, with many fine        
 buildings surrounded by a peaceful    
 countryside.
