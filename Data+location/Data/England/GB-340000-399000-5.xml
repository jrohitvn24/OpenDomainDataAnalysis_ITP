		<content> In our block there is part of Kirkby  
 Industrial estate. In this part of the
 estate there are over 100 companies   
 whose business is extremely varied .  
 There are some well known ones such as
 Birds Eye and Kraft Food Ltd, both of 
 which are concerned with food.Others  
 are responsible for such things as the
 hire of heavy machines , precision    
 tool-making, chemicals and importing  
 timbers. Even so there is still a lot 
 of unemployment in Kirkby and         
 companies are closing all the time.   
   Also in the block there is a        
 recording studio that has made records
 for some famous "pop" groups such as  
 China Crisis . The company is called  
 Amazon Recording Studio.
