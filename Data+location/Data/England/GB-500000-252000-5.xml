		<title>05The R.A.E. Club</title>
		<content> To get to the R.A.E. Club you have to 
 travel up along the A6 past the row of
 shops and then keep going along the A6
 till you get to Twinwoods Road.   On  
 the corner of Twinwoods Road there is 
 a little blue hut and there is a car  
 park.   You can only go into the R.A.E
 club if you are a member or with a    
 member, but if you sign the books you 
 are allowed in only for that night.   
 If you want to be a member you have to
 get an application form and fill it   
 in.   The club then gets you put down 
 on the waiting list and the club then 
 votes on whether or not they want you.
 Some people wait one year or two to   
 get to be a member.   In the room     
 which has games there is a pool table,
 but you have to pay 2Op a go.  There  
 is also a table tennis table and there
 are some skittles with the cheese.
