		<content> Adults participate in various local   
 activities _ Parish Council, Church   
 and Chapel Councils, Village Hall     
 Committees, Over 60's, Womens         
 Institute, Cricket and Tennis Clubs.  
 Public footpaths are used - 2 paths   
 frequently.  Outsiders walk the       
 Icknield Way often.  Home activities  
 include television, videos, sewing,   
 reading, letter writing, home improve-
 ments, gardening _ predominantly large
 gardens.  One unusual hobby is        
 taxidermy _ assisted by living in the 
 country.  Regular pheasant shoots are 
 held.  Also vermin are shot. Few      
 people visit the local public house in
 Chrishall village.
