		<title>05Major Routes.</title>
		<content> Three main routes run parallel to each
 from north to south dividing the area.
 The development of the{M11 motorway}to
 the east of Stansted has reduced much 
 time to reach London and Cambridge and
 has reduced pressure of vehicles      
 through the village.                  
 The{B1383,}formally the{A11}runs      
 through the centre of the village and 
 although still quite busy at peak     
 times,now sacrifices much of the heavy
 transport that the village inherited. 
 Also running through the village and  
 its countryside is the{main rail link 
 from London to Cambridge and the      
 North.                                
{Stansted station}caters mainly for    
 commuters travelling to the cities to 
 their place of employment.It also     
 allows easy access for families to    
 travel to the attractions and sights  
 in London.                            </content>
