		<content>{40 40 IN.}Someone is IT, and the other
 people run and hide.There is a post   
 which is HOME and where the person    
 on IT counts to 44. When he's finished
 counting he has to look for the people
 hiding and they have to try to get to 
 the post unseen and say 40 40 IN or   
 race IT to the post. The first person 
 to be caught 40 40 OUT is the next it.

{JAIL GAME}is a favourite game at      
 school. There are 2 equal teams. One  
 team runs and the other chases. The   
 team that is chasing has to catch the 
 runners. When they do they put them in
 a jail, and their team mates have to  
 free them without being caught        
 themselves. When the whole team is    
 caught they swap around. Steven Bull
