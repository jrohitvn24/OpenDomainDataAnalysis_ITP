 There is only one sizeable wood in the
 area, at the 905294. It is owned by   
 Staffordshire County Council and has  
 recently been felled because of elm   
 disease, but has been replanted. It is
 an important wild life reserve here.

 The farms in the east of this area are
 considerably smaller than those in the
 west, being hiller and having a heavy,
 marl soil. Our farm covers about 40   
 acres and is long and narrow in shape.
 Mr Veron, the tenant farmer, has 40   
 dairy cows which are mainly Ayrshires
