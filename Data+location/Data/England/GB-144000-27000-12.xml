		<content> One day some fishermen were coming in 
 to land their fish on the             
 shore.Suddleny one of the men saw a   
 red figure standing at the top of     
 his voice,and he grabbed the nets and 
 ran up a hill (Carne Road)(which is   
 just behind our school)and on to a    
 rock at the top of a cliff.The        
 fisherman stopped,knelt down and      
 started to pray.The Devil stopped and 
 put his hands over his ears and then  
 began to shout",STOP, STOP."They      
 prayed louder.Suddenly the Devil ran  
 down the beach and jumped into the    
 water.But the shape of the nets his   
 laddle and the Devils feet are        
 engraved on the rock.So they have     
 called it Devils rock ever since!The  
 marks can still be seen to this day.
