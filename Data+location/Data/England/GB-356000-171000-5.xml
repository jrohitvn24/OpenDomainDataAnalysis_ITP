		<title>05Housing in Bristol</title>
		<content> There are quite a few Georgian houses 
 in Bristol.  They are quite big and   
 have a cellar, an attic and 3 or 4    
 floors.  They often have porches in   
 front of the doors, which are very    
 ornate.  As they didn't have central  
 heating when they were built, they    
 have fireplaces in every room, which  
 some people still use in winter.      
 Above the windows, outside, they have 
 bricks arranged like a fan.  The      
 cellars are for keeping the coal in.  
 There is a chute with a metal cover on
 it coming from the road leading to the
 cellar and coalmen can pour coal down 
 it.                                   
                                       
 There are  also quite a lot of        
 Victorian houses in Bristol. They are 
 sometimes detached, semi-detached or  
 terraced.  Victorian houses usually   
 have big and echoey rooms.            </content>
