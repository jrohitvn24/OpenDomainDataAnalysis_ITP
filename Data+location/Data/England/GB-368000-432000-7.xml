		<title>07Farming in Langho area</title>
		<content>    Farming in this area is mixed ,    
dominated  mostly by dairy farms which 
are owner occupied or tenanted from    
large estates or private landlords and 
range in size from belown 50 acres to  
well over 100 acres . The majority of  
milk produced is sold wholesale and    
collected by the Milk Marketing Board  
tankers daily , although several       
farmers in our area have milk rounds   
selling and delivering farm bottled    
milk daily to the door .               
    The land is mainly clay with a top 
covering of soil , producing hay and   
silage for the cattle and sheep in     
Winter and grazing in Summer . A       
combination of cereal , vitamins ,     
minerals and protein is given to cattle
and also to sheep before lambing .     
Farmers use their own machines but     
seasonal work may be done by           
contractor .                           </content>
