		<title>07FARMING IN GRINDLETON</title>
		<content> Farms in this area are situated betw- 
een 215 and 1,000 feet above sea level 
and are only suitable for grass produ- 
ction.The average farm is about 80     
acres,(small compared to other parts   
of the country).The land is            
undulating and supports beef,sheep     
and dairy cows.Now only a few dairy    
farms remain due to competition from   
larger enterprises which can produce   
milk more efficiently.Now farms are    
becoming more intensive-more animals   
are kept on less acreage-and therefore 
grassland has to be kept in top condi- 
ion by re-seeding  old pastures and    
keeping weeds under control.Artificial 
fertilisers are used to produce more   
grass.Nowadays most farms make silage  
with just a small amount of hay.This   
requires less labour and is more suited
to our climate-the average annual rain-
fall is 71 inches.                     </content>
