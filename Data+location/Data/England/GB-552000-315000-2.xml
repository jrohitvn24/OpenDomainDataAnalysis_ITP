 _________                             
 Between Walpole St. Peter,Walpole St. 
 Andrew is Walpole Chase.In July 1985  
 there is a school at one end and the  
 old Manor House at the other.Builders 
 have just begun to build 80 houses and
 bungalows opposite the school and     
 fundraising is well under way for a   
 new village hall/community centre.    
 HOUSING                               
 _______                               
 Houses are clustered around the       
 churches but there is much ribbon     
 development and some people live a    
 considerable distance from shops.There
 is a mixture of council and private   
 housing but the interesting thing is  
 the size of peoples gardens.There are 
 many large gardens which people use to
 grow their own produce.
