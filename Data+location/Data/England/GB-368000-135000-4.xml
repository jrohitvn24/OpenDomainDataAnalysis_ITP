		<title>04     The Tithe Barn.</title>
		<content> The tithe barn at Batts farm has one  
 large door for a loaded wagon to go in
 and one small door for the wagon to go
 out when it's unloaded.The tithe      
 barn's floor is 5.2 metres wide and   
 the solid oak beams in the roof are   
 5.4 metres because they have to fit   
 into the side of the walls.It has     
 small slit windows like a castle and  
 two larger ones,all for air           
 conditioning.The tithe barn has quite 
 thick walls.                          
           In medieval times tithe     
 payments were paid once a year and you
 paid the church, bishops and priests  
 one tenth of your produce or animals  
 for the year. Later on tithes were    
 paid in money. The barn, despite its  
 age still seems to be in good         
 condition.We hope,that in the future  
 the barn will not be knocked down.
