		<title>12Shopping in Bristol</title>
		<content> At present very large supermarkets are
 springing up around the outskirts of  
 Bristol.  To be able to visit these   
 "Super stores" Bedminster shoppers    
 need to have transport as none of them
 is within walking distance of this    
 neighbourhood.                        
 If sufficient customers are attracted 
 to the superstores small local shops  
 will not be able to compete and will  
 close down.  What will happen to those
 shoppers who do not have a car?       
 We wondered who uses our local shops  
 and whether they used supermarkets or 
 superstores as well.                  
 We conducted a survey among 82        
 shoppers at a small local shop about  
 where, how and why they shopped.      
 The results are printed on the next   
 page ("Shopping Survey, Bristol")
