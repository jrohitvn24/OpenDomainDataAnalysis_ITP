 About 20% of the houses in the block  
 are privately owned, the only block of
 council houses are at Tump Lane,      
 although some houses are rented from  
 local landowners. The houses date from
 the 15th century, to ones built in the
 last few years. There are three large 
 houses in the block, Bryngwyn Manor,  
 Strickstenning Hall and Lyston House  
 and 14 farms. Most of the older houses
 have been altered or extended to give 
 up-to-date living standards but some  
 still have amenities available in the 
 19th century. Nearly all houses have  
 mains electricity, but few main       
 drainage. There are still many houses 
 using private water supplies.
