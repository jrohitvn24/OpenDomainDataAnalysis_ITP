		<title>06HOLLINGBURY FARM CAPEL</title>
		<content>   Hollingbury Farm is a 110 acre      
 arable and beef herd farm in Capel.   
 Mrs.Daniels,the farmer's wife showed  
 us around the farm and told us about  
 the machinery.We saw a combine        
 harvester, 2 tractors,a snowplough and
 the augers which suck up hay or straw 
 and separate them.                    
   1 acre costs Â£1500-Â£2000. Cropping  
 is on a 4 year rotation;2 years of    
 wheat; 1 of barley and then either 1  
 of oilseed rape or 1 of beans.The oil 
 from oilseed rape is used in margarine
 The flour from wheat is used for bread
 and spaghetti.Barley is either shipped
 to deprived countries,or used for     
 animal feed.Beans are used for cattle 
 feed or pigeon meal.They also have    
 grass fields which are cut for hay and
 used to feed the animals in winter.   
 Afterwards Mrs.Daniels gave us drinks.
