		<title>09The Church on Blackheath</title>
		<content>  The Rev. Henry Burgin,priest i/c All 
Saints Blackheath was questioned by    
pupils from the church school.He has   
been a priest for 10 yrs.Before he was 
an actor,opera singer &amp; social worker. 
He is Chaplain to the Soc.of St.       
George. His church duties are to take  
baptisms,weddings,funerals,services &amp;  
give advice.Often people come to the   
Heath,see the vicarage &amp; knock to talk 
about their problems. 210 are on the   
electoral roll &amp; about 120 take        
communion each Sunday.Most are         
comfortably off &amp; the church pays its  
contribution to the diocese.Many think 
that it is "High" as it has            
candles,incense,images,robes,servers   
&amp; a sung service.He doesnt think it    
matters as long as people turn to God  
&amp; Christ &amp; create a world of peace &amp;   
love.The school cooperates with church 
&amp; every contact benefits everyone.     </content>
