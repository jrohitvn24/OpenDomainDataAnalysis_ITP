		<title>01Brackley area general</title>
		<content>    Our twelve square kilometres of    
land is mostly farmland. There are     
three farms in the area.               
   The A43 goes through Brackley       
joining Oxford to Northampton and, with
so much traffic going through, the     
roads are starting to deteriorate.     
   Evenley is a pretty village south of
Brackley. Evenley Hall, which is a     
large old house owned by the National  
Children's Trust is between Evenley and
Brackley and has a large park area.    
   Astwick is an abandoned village     
south-west of Brackley. All the houses 
have crumbled and nobody lives there.  
   The southern part of Brackley itself
is in our area. The population estimate
(based on the last census) is 8000.    
   Brackley is within easy reach of    
several large towns such as Northampton
(20 miles), Oxford (20 miles), Coventry
(37 miles) and Stratford (30 miles).   </content>
