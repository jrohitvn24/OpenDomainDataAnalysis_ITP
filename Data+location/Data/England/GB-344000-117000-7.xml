		<title>07Ghosts in Stoke</title>
		<content>    One day the head of the Fluer found
 out that one of his lower monks was   
 spying for the Abbot of the Priory. So
 he asked the Abbot of the Priory to   
 come round for a conference. The two  
 began to argue and it got out of hand 
 and soon the Abbot of the Priory      
 stormed out. The Head of the Fluer    
 followed him and ended the fight      
 forever by stabbing him. I think  that
 the ghost of the Priory and Fluer are 
 the ghosts of the two monks,the one   
 from the priory out for revenge and   
 the one from the Fluer is running     
 away. The man living in the Priory has
 seen the ghost but knows of no        
 connection like the one explained     
 here.  So this needs further          
 investigation.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
