 Wimpey is a national building firm    
 working near our school.They are      
 converting 128 orginal houses into 105
 and renovating them.Each house is     
 costing about Â£17,000. The total bill 
 for the houses is Â£1,700,000. They    
 started the work in January 1985 and  
 hope to finish in May 1986. These     
 houses are all army quarters and were 
 orginally built in 1932.There are     
 about 80 workers of different trades  
 on the site and we saw many of them at
 their work when we were shown round   
 the site.The other national building  
 firm is Barratts.They are building    
 private houses as an extension to     
 their existing estate in Scotton      
 Village, where the first houses were  
 built about ten years ago.
