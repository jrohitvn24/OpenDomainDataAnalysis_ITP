		<title>20A Day In My Life</title>
		<content>   After school on Fridays I come home 
 and do my homework. At 5.00 p.m. I go 
 with my brother and Dad to play squash
 at the local squash courts. At 5.45   
 p.m. I get home and go out again at   
 6.15 p.m. to play football at the     
 local club.                           
   There are 6 years in the club and I 
 am in the under 13's. We play in the  
 winter months and into early summer   
 when we change to training. There are 
 about 100 members in the club.        
 After coming home at 7.15 p.m. I have 
 dinner and watch T.V.                 
 Later at about 8.00 p.m. I sort out my
 collections of coins, stamps, rubber, 
 badges and bookmarks. At about 10.00  
 p.m. I go to bed.
