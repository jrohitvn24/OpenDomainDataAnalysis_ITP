		<title>17Wiltshire in Winter.</title>
		<content> In winter it is so cold sometimes that
 ice covers the river. Shallow ponds in
 fields freeze over. Children walk or  
 skate on them. The ice can be up to 14
 centimetres thick.                    
 Usually there is some snow after      
 Christmas. If the wind blows, it makes
 deep drifts, especially where there   
 are few trees and hedges. Some roads  
 are blocked for days, until the snow  
 plough comes and the roads are gritted
 and salted.                           
 West Overton school closed one day,   
 because the teachers could not get    
 there. Early in 1985 the snow was over
 six feet deep in the lane near West   
 Overton church.                       
 The children went sledging on Gaston  
 Hill, between Fyfield and the River   
 Kennet. They couldn't play football or
 netball, so they built snowmen and    
 had snowball fights instead.          </content>
