		<title>05Grangewaters Water Sports</title>
		<content> Grangewaters is a large lake,which    
 used to be a quarry.It is about 50    
 feet deep in the middle.The sports    
 that go on at Grangewaters are        
 wind-surfing,canoing,water-skiing,    
 power boat racing and sailing. There  
 is also an observation tower where you
 can look over the lake and there are  
 some big changing rooms behind the    
 tower.                                
 There is lots of wildlife and pondlife
 at Grangewaters.We saw Water Boatman, 
 Shrips,Great Diving Beetles,          
 Dragon flies, Pond Snails and Water   
 Skaters all around the lake.The birds 
 you can find there are Coot,Grebe and 
 Reed Warblers.                        
 Many children from local schools visit
 the centre to use the facilities and  
 study the wildlife.
