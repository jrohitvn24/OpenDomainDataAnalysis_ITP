		<content>  The Horbury and South Osset area was 
 able to develop in the nineteenth     
 century due to good canal,road,and    
 rail links with the rest of the       
 industrial north.                     
  Today the success of the area owes   
 much to the excellent                 
 communications.The local railway      
 station closed in 1970,(Wakefield     
 has two stations) and the canal no    
 longer plays a significant role,but   
 the location of two motorway          
 intersections nearby has undoubtedly  
 attracted industry into the area and  
 allowed local people to commute easily
 to jobs in West and South Yorkshire.In
 fact,the intersection between the M1  
 and M62,has helped the area claim to  
 be the "crossroads of the North",a    
 position it last held in the great    
 coaching days of the eighteenth       
 century.                              </content>
