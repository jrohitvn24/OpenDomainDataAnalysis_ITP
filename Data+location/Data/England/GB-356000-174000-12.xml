  In my bed_room just above my bed I've
 got a scene from "The Hobbit" which   
 cleverly reflects light in different  
 shades.Above my desk I've got a mirror
 with a picture of a B.M.X.on it.This  
 was given to me for Christmas.To the  
 left of my window I've got a poster of
 Snoopy given me by my Dad when he came
 back from America.                    
  In the lounge we've got a pen and ink
 drawing by Simon Drew of a bird flying
 just in front of a zip closing up the 
 sky.                                  
  In the kitchen are a couple of plates
 one with patterns on,which my Nan got 
 from a jumble sale and another with a 
 picture of a famous inventor called   
 Brunel which my Mum got from an art   
 shop.
