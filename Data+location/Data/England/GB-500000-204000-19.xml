		<content>{A RETIRED LADY}                       
 This lady was much less concerned     
 about the lack of facilities in the   
 village.Her bungalow backed onto the  
 river and canal which she enjoyed     
 without having to worry about safety. 
 Nor was she concerned about the       
 traffic as she used a car rather than 
 walk.The problem of traffic noise was 
 overcome by double glazing although   
 they did notice railway noise in the  
 garden.                               
 The young mother was disturbed by the 
 noise from the pubs etc.near her      
 especially at closing time but the    
 older lady was unconcerned as she     
 lived farther away.                   
 Both people had to go by car to Hemel 
 Hempstead to shop and felt that the   
 amenity that was most lacking was a   
 village shop that sold fresh          
 bread,groceries,vegetables etc.       </content>
