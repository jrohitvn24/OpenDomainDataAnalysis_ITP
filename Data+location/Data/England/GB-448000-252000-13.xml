		<content>THE MOST POPULAR GAMES PEOPLE USED TO  
PLAY AND PLAY NOW ARE  FOOTBALL,       
HOPSCOTCH AND TIG. TIG IS A GAME WHERE 
SOMEONE IS ON.THEY HAVE TO CATCH       
SOMEONE ELSE.THERE IS A LITTLE SIGN    
WHEN YOU  DON'T WANT TO BE CAUGHT.YOU  
HAVE TO CROSS YOUR FINGERS AND SHOUT   
"NIGSESE".FIVE STONES IS A GAME THAT   
WASITE POPULAR .WE THROW FIVE STONES   
INTO THE AIR AND CATCH THEM ON THE BACK
OF YOUR HAND.THIS GAME IS QUITE        
DIFFICULT.IT TAKES A LOT OF SKILL AND  
PRACTICE TO DO IT RIGHT.WE ASKED       
PARENTS IF THEY THOUGHT CHILDREN PLAY  
AS WELL AS THEY USED TO.MOST PEOPLE SAY
THEY DO AND A COUPLE OF PEOPLE SAY     
THEY DON'T BECAUSE  COMPUTERS AND      
TELEVISIONS ARE TAKING CONTROL OVER    
CHILDREN SO THEY DON'T MIX WITH OTHER  
CHILDREN SO MUCH.
