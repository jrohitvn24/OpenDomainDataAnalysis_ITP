		<title>20Ecology in Milton Ernest</title>
		<content>{Milton Ernest}is a small village in   
 a rural setting. Many of the hedgerows
 in the area have been removed         
 resulting in wide open fields of hay, 
 crops and pasture. The farmers are    
 aware of posible harmful ecological   
 consequences and are striving towards 
 environmental conservation and have   
 planted many trees. There are oak,    
 ash, elm, beech, birch, sycamore,     
 horsechestnut, willow, fir, conifer,  
 yew, holly, elder, rowan, hawthorn,   
 whitebeam and maple trees throughout  
 the D. Block. People are very aware of
 conservation matters and the effects  
 of pollution upon the environment. The
 A6 with its vast quantity of traffic  
 causes a pollution problem as does the
 proximity of the{Royal Aeronautical   
{Establishment,}outside Milton Ernest  
 on the Thurleigh Road. Little is known
 of this top secret establishment.     </content>
