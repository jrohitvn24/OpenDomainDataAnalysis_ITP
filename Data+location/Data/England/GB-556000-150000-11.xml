		<title>11Building Changes.</title>
		<content> In our area many buildings have       
 changed their usage because they are  
 no longer needed for their original   
 purpose.                              
 As hops are no longer grown here oast 
 houses have been converted into       
 attractive homes.Barns have also been 
 converted as bigger,modern barns are  
 being built.                          
 Life in Shipbourne has changed,since  
 the coming of the motor car people    
 have been able to travel out of the   
 village.This means that they shop else
 where and don't use the local shops.So
 the butcher shop the Post Office and  
 village shop are now comfortable      
 homes.                                
 Stumle Hill was once the vicarage but 
 now a modern smaller one has been     
 built.
