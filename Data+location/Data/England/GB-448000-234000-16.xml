		<content>    Many people go to the Adult        
 Education classes.   There are Keep   
 Fit classes for men, women and the    
 over 50's, Self Defence, Yoga and     
 "Fight the Flab", the catch phrase of 
 popular Radio and TV personality Terry
 Wogan.   At Ballroom Dancing you can  
 learn the waltz and quickstep and     
 there are tap and folk-dancing        
 sessions too.                         
    Less strenuous classes include     
 learning to play Bridge, micro-wave   
 cooking, cake-icing, sewing, art,     
 flower-arranging and French           
 Conversation.                         
    Most of the classes take place in  
 the School or the Baptist Rooms.  They
 usually happen on week-day afternoons 
 or evenings and last for one to two   
 hours;  the courses are usually for 10
 - 13 weeks. The cost seems very       
 reasonable at about Â£1 a session.     </content>
