		<content>In Sywell, there is only one shop      
although the village is visited by many
mobile trade vans and door-to-door     
sales persons. The shop opens at       
9.00am and closes at 5.30pm. The shop  
is used by the local community for much
of their shopping but the majority of  
people only buy bits and pieces. Some  
people go to the nearby towns of       
Northampton or Wellingborough but      
mostly to Weston Favell where there is 
an undercover precinct  to include a   
Tesco supermarket, various small shops,
banks etc., trade stands, a library, a 
health centre and a sports centre with 
a swimming pool and where there is     
ample free parking. At Sywell          
Superette, it is possible to  buy      
frozen, tinned and fresh food          
including meat, fruit and vegetables.  
It is also possible to buy toys and    
clothes, greetings cards, wines etc..  </content>
