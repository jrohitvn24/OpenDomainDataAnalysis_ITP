		<title>13GROBY HIGH SCHOOL CLUBS.</title>
		<content>    Brookvale High School in Groby     
 offers many clubs and societies for   
 pupils.Many involve a sport and those 
 available include gymnastics,         
 trampolining,volleyball,dance and     
 cross country in addition to the usual
 range of team games.Non sporting clubs
 include a drama group, which in June  
 this year put on a very enjoyable     
 production of 'Bugsy Malone',and      
 'Fighting Fantasy' and 'Dungeons and  
 Dragons'clubs.Both the latter ones    
 being run by the pupils themselves.For
 those who enjoy work there are even   
 Maths,Science and Writing clubs.      
    Members of clubs are given a blue  
 'Priority Pass',which enables them to 
 have their lunch straight away when   
 the bell goes thus missing 15 minutes 
 waiting time in the queue.Belonging to
 a club is fun and gives you a chance  
 to represent the school.              </content>
