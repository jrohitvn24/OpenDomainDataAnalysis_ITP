		<title>09Tourism around Newark</title>
		<content>    Most people interviewed did not    
 feel that Newark is a tourist         
 attraction,but it could be if         
 improvements were made such as more   
 sign posts directing you to places of 
 interest and a general tidying up.    
 However,they did not want Newark to be
 modernised in any way.More museums and
 free car parking were also suggested. 
    A number of tourists who were      
 visiting Newark were asked what they  
 thought of it.Generally,they liked    
 Newark and found it of historic       
 interest particularly the cobbled     
 market place.But they feel that more  
 museums should be built in order to   
 display Newark's history in more      
 detail.
