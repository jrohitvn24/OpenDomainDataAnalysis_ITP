		<title>07VILLAGES-SHERIFFHALES AREA</title>
		<content> In the village of{Sheriffhales}there  
 is little transport and there are no  
 bus services.The place around the     
 villages are very tidy and there is no
 litter. Some villages have big country
 houses and others have bungalows.I    
 like villages they are peaceful and   
 usually there is no vandalism.Most    
 people like villages because they are 
 not like city or towns they are quite 
 the opposite. The gardens are very    
 tidy and some of the houses and       
 gardens are shaded by trees. The      
 village i am looking at is            
{Sherrifhales}and there is only one    
 village shop which is a post office   
 too.
