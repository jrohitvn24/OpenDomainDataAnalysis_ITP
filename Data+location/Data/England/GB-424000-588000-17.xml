 Q. Does the sight of the pit Workshops
 put you off this area?                
{A. No, they do not put us off this    
{area as you don't see them from the   
{house because of the long Gardens.    
 Q. What is the least thing you like   
 about Ashington?                      
{A. Em, the swimming baths are of poor 
{quality, and there are too many pubs  
{and clubs.                            
 Q. If you could do any improvements on
 Ashington what would you do?          
{A. The first thing I would do is to   
{make more open places and spaces for  
{the kids to play in,then I would open 
{up the cinemas, but the best          
{improvement I could make would be to  
{open a Garden Centre.                 
 A. If you had the choice to knock     
 anything down or demolish anything    
 what would it be?                     </content>
