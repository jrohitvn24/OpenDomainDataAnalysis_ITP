 I have snacks every day.  My favourite
 meal is hotdog and chips, a cake and  
 a cup of apple juice.  It takes me 20 
 minutes to eat my dinner.  You are    
 only allowed to have four units a day.
 When you have got your food we go to a
 tray and get a knife, fork and spoon. 
 Every Monday we get a new dinner card 
 which costs three pounds, twenty five 
 pence.  If you forget your card you   
 have to sign the book.  The next day  
 you go to the office and Mrs Hayles   
 crosses out four units.
