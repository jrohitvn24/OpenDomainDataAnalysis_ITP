		<title>11 THE FLOOD SCHEME BRUTON.</title>
		<content>   The area around Bruton has suffered 
the effects of heavy and subsequent    
flooding for many years.Its position   
in a narrow valley naturally encourages
floods,acting as a funnel for water    
from the hills.The 1982 flood served to
emphasise the problems of the area.    
    As a result a scheme to prevent the
effects of serious flooding was        
suggested.By 1985 the flood prevention 
scheme was completed,having involved   
a fair degree of work and inconvenience
including the closure of a main road   
out of Bruton,for several months.      
   Essentially the water from the      
surrounding hills is collected out-    
side the settlement and then taken     
through Bruton,under the ground in     
a huge tunnel,several feet high and    
deposited in another collection point  
on the other side.As yet the scheme has
not been fully tested:we await the day!</content>
