		<content> Harperley Hall is a Georgian Manor    
 which has been owned by a number of   
 wealthy families until, in 1946 it was
 bought by the Durham Police Authority.
 It is used for a variety of reasons   
 but the grounds are kept for the      
 stabling of the Durham police force   
 mounted section and for the training  
 of the police dog section.            
 The actual building is  used for the  
 various courses that police officers  
 are required to attend whilst they are
 still training and for introducing new
 methods which are introduced from time
 to time.                              
 Until recently visits could be        
 arranged but it si preferred if any   
 visit is by the horses and dogs to the
 schools or by visiting the local      
 police station under the watchful eye 
 of each schools own community police  
 officer.                              </content>
