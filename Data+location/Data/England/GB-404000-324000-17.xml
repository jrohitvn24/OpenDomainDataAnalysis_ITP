		<title>17SHOPPING</title>
		<content> In Bagots Street Abbots Bromley there 
 are two butchers shops. The first     
 butcher  sells meat, fruit and        
 lollipops, bread,vegetables and frozen
 food. The one opposite sells meat,    
 sweets. vegetables, fruit and         
 bread.The shop at the end of the      
 village  sells little toys, sweets,   
 wrapping paper and newspapers. This   
 shop has just been sold. There are not
 as many shops as there used to be. If 
 you wanted something and none of the  
 shops had got it you would have to go 
 to Uttoxeter, Burton or Stafford.
