		<title>10BRIGHSTONE DOCTOR</title>
		<content>  The village has its own practice with
 the surgery situated so close to the  
 church and graveyard that the doctors 
 are tired of the jokes about it.      
  Each morning is given over to time at
 the surgery. The doctors see patients 
 by appointment only. After this any   
 necessary house calls are made and    
 this means that the doctor must have  
 flexible lunch arrangements!          
  The afternoons are taken up by more  
 calls to sick patients or else by     
 special clinics. For example the      
 ante_natal clinc is on Wednesday      
 afternoon.                            
  To help the partners at the practice 
 a answer_phone has been installed but 
 at present this high technology is    
 proving to be faulty!                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
