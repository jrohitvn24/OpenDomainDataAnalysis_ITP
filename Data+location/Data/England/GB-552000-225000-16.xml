		<title>16Ugley Green</title>
		<content>      Ugley Green is located midway    
 between Elsenham railway station and  
 what was once the notorious A11       
 (re-classified since the M11 was      
 completed as a B road).  The M11      
 passes just east of Ugley Green but   
 doesn't disturb this picturesque      
 hamlet of residences that remind us of
 former times.  Many of the homes here 
 are thatched cottages and one cannot  
 help but feel that it has hardly      
 changed for many years.               
      The village pump still stands on 
 the green.  Beside it is a great      
 boulder of pudding stone which is     
 beleived was used as a sign post in   
 the times past by people travelling   
 through the forest and up the hill.   
      In one of the cottages on the    
 green live Olive and Aurthur Dix.     
 They are brother and sister and the   
 cottage has been in their family since</content>
