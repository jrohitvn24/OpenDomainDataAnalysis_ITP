		<title>17The Village Shop</title>
		<content>   The Shop has been there for about 10
 years. There are three people who work
 there. Two people live in Welshampton 
 and one lives in Shrewsbury. It sells 
 a wide range of goods. It is          
 self-service.                         
   Friday is the busiest day of the    
 week. There have been a lot of changes
 recently. Diesel is sold as well as   
 petrol. Village people use the shop   
 most. It is used by holiday people    
 from the canal. Milk and bread sell   
 best. The owners have no future       
 changes in mind as the shop was       
 changed to self-service fairly        
 recently.
