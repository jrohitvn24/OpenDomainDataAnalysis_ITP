		<title>19THE AREA-Steep to Hawkley 1</title>
		<content> The region north of the Stoner Hill   
 escarpment consists mainly of rolling 
 corn and oilseed rape fields,criss-   
 crossed by roads, long high bushy     
 hedges, ditches and deep folds in the 
 landscape.There's evidence to suggest 
 says local historian, Bill Whiteman,  
 that the Froxfield Plateau was once   
 the site of a large Romano/British    
 cattle ranch &amp; it may be that the area
 was popular as a Saxon hunting park.  
 Many of the  features in the area     
 -ditches,tracks &amp; Wheatham Hill,a pro-
 -minent feature found to the E of the 
 escarpment-can be easily identified in
 the Saxon Land Charters &amp;,to this day,
 form many of the parish boundaries in 
 the area.The escarpment,which bounds  
 the plateau on the eastern &amp; southern 
 edge &amp; which embraces the hangers, was
 the result,millions of years ago, of  
 dramatic geological activity in Europe</content>
