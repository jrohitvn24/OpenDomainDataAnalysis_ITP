		<title>07EMPLOYMENT IN BULKINGTON</title>
		<content> Bulkington is mainly a farming village
 employing family workers. Campbell-   
 Gray is a plant hire company employing
 approximately 8 people, including     
 secretaries, truck and lorry drivers, 
 mechanics and a manager. Roundstone   
 Catering supplies different           
 organisations, including restaurants  
 and hotels with items such as cookers,
 vending machines, and general         
 equipment used in the catering trade. 
 It employs around 5 people. There are 
 2 builders in the village, together   
 employing 5 regular workers, but sub- 
 contracting labour for larger work    
 (eg the building of houses). About 60%
 of the local inhabitants work outside 
 the village and there is a very low   
 incidence of unemployment. About 10   
 retired people live in Bulkington.
