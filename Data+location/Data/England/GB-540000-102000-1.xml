		<content>  This block covers downland, a rapidly
expanding residential area, a valley, a
river, farms, and villages. It is south
of Lewes and north of Newhaven on the  
East Sussex coast.                     
 The South Downs are protected from new
building by restrictive orders.        
Piddinghoe does have more recent       
development (not welcomed by all the   
residents). The valley provides rail   
and road connections to Newhaven.      
Farming in the area is changing from   
dairy herds to arable crops, though    
Halcombe Farm has battery hens.        
 The coastal residential strip between 
Brighton and Eastbourne is a desirable 
area for retirement as well as for     
workers prepared to commute to London. 
Peaceheaven has expanded in recent     
years with private developments such   
as Strawberry Hill. Shopping facilities
are nearby in the Meridian centre.     </content>
