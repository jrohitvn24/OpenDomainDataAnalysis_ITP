		<content> Isolated farms and cottages are the   
 only dwellings.  Some of these are no 
 longer permanently occupied and are   
 let as holiday dwellings.  Some people
 work in Winchcombe or in Cheltenham,  
 and, remote farm cottages have begun  
 to attract people who want to live in 
 a quiet place.  Most people who live  
 here are engaged in farming but       
 farming now offers employment to fewer
 people and the vacant accomodation is 
 taken up by people who work elsewhere.
 There are fewer than thirty adult     
 voters recorded on the electorial     
 system.
