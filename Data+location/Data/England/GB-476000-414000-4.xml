		<title>04COTTAGE FARM.</title>
		<content>   {Cottage Farm}was built in 1837,    
 although a farm has stood on the      
 same site since before the{Domesday   
{Book.}In the winter from November till
 April the cattle are brought inside   
 and are fed from the farmer.The       
 mothers and their young are brought   
 into separate sheds where there is    
 more shelter and it is warmer.        
    Years ago when people used horses  
 and carts the horses were kept in     
 sheds  near the cattle.The horses had 
 separate stables from each other and  
 had plenty of food through the winter.
   {Mains water}and{electricty}were    
 only introduced in the{late 40's.     
 Before  electricity, people used      
 paraffin lamps.The farmer would hang  
 these  on  hooks in the middle of the 
 room.  Water was obtained from one of 
 four wells.{Filtered drinking water   
 could be brought from Crowle,in carts.</content>
