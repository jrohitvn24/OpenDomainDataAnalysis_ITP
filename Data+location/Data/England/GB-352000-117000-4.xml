		<content>  Mr.and Mrs.Harold Cowcher have been  
 living at 42,Coombe Street Lane for 31
 years.The house they live in was built
 in 1937.When they moved into this     
 house,the road was a narrow mud       
 track,with no pavements and no        
 lighting.Mudford Recreation Ground was
 a Pig farm with a narrow walkway going
 through it.                           
  There were just a few houses in the  
 lane,but gradually people bought land 
 and built houses in other people's    
 gardens.                              
  There was a shop in Coombe Street    
 Lane,it was in a shack.It sold        
 groceries.There was a Nursery behind  
 and if you asked for a lettuce the man
 would go and cut one for you.Number 54
 is where the shop used to be.         
   The road runs along the top of the  
 escarpment,the houses are large and   
 have fine views over Somerset.        </content>
