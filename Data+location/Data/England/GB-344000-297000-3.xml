		<title>03Large farms N.E.of Longmynd</title>
		<content>  The large farms surveyed had been    
 owned by the same families for gen-   
 erations.Nowadays they are run by very
 few men because of increased mechanis-
 ation.Harvesting of cereals and silage
 for winter feed is done by contractors
 The recent cut in milk quotas has     
 forced a reduction in dairy herds and 
 a switch to calf-rearing for beef.Gov-
 ernment grants are available for      
 building improvements but are not     
 sufficient to finance buildings of the
 required standard.                    
  Farmers are interested in conserv-   
 ation and maintain hedges,woodland and
 paths.Sheep are reared  on farms which
 own grazing land on the lower slopes  
 of the Longmynd.Working collies are   
 kept for livestock control.Some       
 farmers'wives offer Bed &amp; Breakfast to
 tourists and one farm has a popular   
 small caravan site.                   </content>
