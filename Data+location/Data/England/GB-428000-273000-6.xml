		<title>06WARWICK UNIVERSITY</title>
		<content>The University of Warwick was built on 
400 of land. The site has doubled in   
size. In 1965 the first undergraduates 
were admitted. First we went to the    
Sports' Hall where we saw students     
playing all different kinds of sports  
like basketball, tennis, badminton and 
rock-climbing etc. The building has got
an indoor heated swimming pool. One    
half of the pool was roped off because 
local schoolchildren were practising   
for a Gala. The other half was being   
used by students. There are 4 squash   
courts. There is an Arts Centre, open  
to the public, where concerts,plays and
films are shown. In the public areas   
are examples of modern art. A new      
cinema is being built. Most buildings  
are of white-painted concrete and few  
of them are taller than 4 storeys.
