		<title>04THE BRIDGE</title>
		<content> The bridge which spans the River Nene 
 at Sutton Bridge dates back to        
 1897.This present bridge is the third 
 bridge to be built. The bridge was    
 built to take both road and rail      
 traffic. The railways stopped in 1964 
 and so the bridge now carries only    
 road traffic.The traffic passing over 
 the bridge is estimated at more than  
 three thousand an hour, trvalling to  
 the coast of Norfolk and the South.   
 The bridge is vitally important to    
 drivers coming from the North wishing 
 to visit the South East. The bridge is
 a swing bridge that opens on average  
 once a day to allow ships to pass to  
 the port of Wisbech.
