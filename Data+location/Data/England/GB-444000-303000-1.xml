		<title>01Desford, Newbold Verdon Area</title>
		<content> The area is a rural belt of farmland, 
 with a strong coal mining history.    
 It encompasses the two large villages 
 of Desford and Newbold Verdon, and the
 hamlets of Merrylees, and Newbold     
 Heath. Both Desford and Newbold are   
 large dormitory villages with much    
 of the workforce being employed in the
 nearby connurbations of Hinckley and  
 Leicester. The local mines are now    
 closed, but many miners are still     
 employed at Bagworth. Both villages   
 are a mixture of old houses, a large  
 council and large newer private       
 housing estates. Dairy farming tends  
 to dominate the agricultural scene,   
 although a variety of crops are grown 
 on the arable land.
