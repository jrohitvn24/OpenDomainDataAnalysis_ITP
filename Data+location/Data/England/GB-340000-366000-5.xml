 IN THE HALF MILE COUNTRY ROAD LEADING 
 TO HAMMOND SCHOOL,HOOLE BANK,THERE ARE
 50 SPECIES OF BIRDS WHICH INCLUDE THE 
 HOUSE SPARROW,BLUE TIT,HEDGE SPARROW, 
 WREN,SONGTHRUSH,SWIFT,SWALLOW CUCKOO, 
 GULL,BLACKBIRD,MAGPIE,COLLARD DOVE.   
 SOME OF THE UNCOMMON BIRDS ARE YELLOW 
 WAGTAIL,NUTHATCH,TREE CREEPER,AND     
 GREATER SPOTTED WOODPECKER.THE REDWING
 AND FIELDFARE ARE ALSO FOUND,THESE    
 COME FROM SCANDINAVIA. MOORHENS COULD 
 ONCE HAVE BEEN SEEN IN A SMALL BROOK, 
 BUT WHEN THE M53 MOTORWAY WAS BUILT   
 THE BROOK WAS FILLED IN AND THE       
 MOORHENS HAVE GONE.THERE ARE FEWER    
 SKYLARKS AS SOME TREES WERE FELLED FOR
 THE MOTORWAY AND SOME ELM TREES HAVE  
 DIED FROM DUTCH ELM DISEASE SO        
 REDUCING THE NUMBER OF NESTING PLACES 
 FOR THE BIRDS.
