		<title>08FARMS IN NORTH FAREHAM</title>
		<content> Heytesbury Farm is typical of North   
 Fareham.It is a mixed farm of 200ha.  
 It has a dairy herd of 80 Friesian    
 cattle which graze on permanent       
 pasture on the clay soils,close to the
 buildings.The slurry from the cattle  
 byres is used as fertiliser.Over most 
 of the farm the fences and hedges have
 been removed to maximise the land     
 available for cultivation,and to make 
 the use of machinery easier.A rotation
 of grass,wheat,barley and potatoes is 
 grown.There is also some woodland on  
 the farm,but it is only felled for the
 farmer's own use.The farm is highly   
 mechanised,and the fields are large by
 Hampshire standards enabling the use  
 of the farm's huge combine            
 harvesters.The farmer maximises his   
 output by the use of fertilisers,     
 pesticides and weedkillers.
