		<title>14SPORTS AND PASTIMES</title>
		<content>    There are no purpose built         
 amenities on the resident's doorsteps.
 The one advantage is the open space   
 enabling adults and children to enjoy 
 gardening(the most popular pastime)   
 fishing,walking, horse-riding, cylcing
 shooting and birdwatching. Needless to
 say television viewing fills people's 
 leisure hours, perhaps because it is  
 relaxing after all the outdoor        
 pursuits. Knitting, reading,music,    
 sewing and completing crosswords are  
 restful pastimes. However the more    
 energetic take part in anything from  
 badminton to swimming. There are      
 facilities for these sports in        
 surrounding towns. Games of rugby     
 football and cricket take place in the
 area, as do yoga and keep-fit classes.
 The residents enjoy a wide-range of   
 hobbies and make the most of the      
 amenities available.                  </content>
