		<title>02Warrenby Village</title>
		<content> Warrenby was once a village for the   
 steel workers. It had 12 streets of   
 houses, a school, a Working Men's Club
 and a pub. One feature of the village 
 was the Hugh Bell Cottages. These     
 cottages were retirement homes for the
 steel workers. The people who lived in
 Warrenby  were moved to better housing
 in Redcar during the 1970's.          
                                       
 Today the pub is a bus company depot, 
 the school is a removal firm and the  
 club was recently closed down.        
 Now things are changing. The Hugh Bell
 Cottages have been renovated and are  
 small workshops.                      
                                       
 Coatham Marsh which lies behind the   
 village is now a Nature Reserve. The  
 Marsh is popular with bird watchers   
 and featured on the BBC TV programme  
 "Looks Natural".                      </content>
