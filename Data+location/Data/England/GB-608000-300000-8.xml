		<title>08"KETT DAY" JULY 6TH 1985</title>
		<content>{BY MR.S.Kelly (Organiser)             
   Kett Day was held in Wymondham      
 on July 6th; the anniversary of the   
 local peasant's uprising against the  
 enclosure of common land.Robert Kett, 
 a Wymondham landowner led the uprising
 in 1549.                              
   On the day, the town was closed to  
 traffic and an attempt was made to    
 recreate the atmosphere of a medieval 
 feast day. Many town organisations    
 contributed events such as dancing,   
 singing and street theatre. There were
 also demonstrations of arts and crafts
   The day began with a service at the 
 Abbey which was followed by the Kett  
 lecture given by the Arch Deacon of   
 Norfolk from the steps of the Market  
 Cross.                                
   All those with the name of Kett were
 invited to Wymondham to join in the   
 celebrations.                         </content>
