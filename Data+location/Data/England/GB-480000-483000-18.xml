		<content> Mr Darrell, a local postman,has become
 famous as a champion{sheepdog handler,
 and has been training them for about  
 30 years. It takes about 18 months to 
 train one.                            
 His first trial was in 1956 at Bolton 
 Abbey.After winning at national and   
 international trials he was invited to
 take part in the popular television   
 programme,"One Man and His Dog ".He   
 came second in the contest.The        
 achievement he most treasures is      
 winning the Brace International       
 Championship in 1981 with his two dogs
 Pat and Cap. He is often invited to   
 give demonstrations to the public,    
 usually at galas and shows. Mr Darrell
 prefers trials to demonstrations      
 because he enjoys the competition that
 these involve.
