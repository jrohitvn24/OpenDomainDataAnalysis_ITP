		<content>  This grid area contains most of the  
 parish of Stambourne and parts of     
 Toppesfield, Cornish Hall End, Steeple
 Bumpstead and Birdbrook. The main     
 built-up area forms part of the       
 village of Stambourne: the church,    
 village hall and about one-third of   
 the houses fall in the next grid area.
  Stambourne has a population of about 
 350. Settlement is concentrated in two
 main areas - around the chapel and    
 Post Office and around the church and 
 village hall. There are also about 30 
 outlying farms and houses. The rest of
 the area is agricultural land.        
  The nearest towns are Haverhill (7   
 miles), Halstead (10 miles) and       
 Sudbury (12 miles).
