 later when the infant room was built  
 the total went to Â£832.The school was 
 built to accommodate 150 pupils but   
 now there are only 60 children.The    
 first school master was a Mr.John     
 Houghton his salary was Â£57:10        
 shillings a year. There was a school  
 house where John Houghton lived with  
 his wife and children.The house is now
 a staff room , office and a first &amp;   
 second year junior classroom.The      
 school has one hall and that was used 
 for a classroom then.Nowadays children
 come to school and have the same      
 teacher through the day.The subjects  
 are maths ,art, english, and          
 athletics, science, history and
