		<title>06CHURWELL TODAY.</title>
		<content> Churwell grew up along a Roman road,  
 now Old Road.The oldest building in   
 the area is Manor House Farm,dated    
 1605 where Oliver Cromwell possibly   
 stayed.                               
 Elland Road was built parallel to the 
 Roman road and the main shops and     
 public houses built along side it.It  
 was a toll road.The number of shops   
 declined after the opening of a super-
 market in Morley.Today there are 3    
 public houses,4 small food shops and 4
 other shops.A barber's,butcher's,elec-
 trician's,2 fish and chip shops and 2 
 Co-op's have all disappeared.         
 An annual event is the Pram Race in   
 June,run fromthe Working Men's Club to
 Morley.People dress up in costumes and
 push prams with people in them,some   
 dressed as babies.the contestants have
 to stop at each public house on route 
 to take a drink.                      </content>
