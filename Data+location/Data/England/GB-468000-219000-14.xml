On the road between Springhill Prison  
and Grendon Underwood Mrs.Mitchell and 
her daughter Clare were walking to     
school and when they got near to the   
brook a blue van swerved and knocked   
Mrs. Mitchell and Clare off the path   
and into the field.The blue van hit    
Mrs.Mitchell in the lungs and they     
shattered and that was the cause of her
death.Clare was quite lucky as she was 
thrown clear of the metal bars and she 
lay in the field unconcious and it was 
later said that she had broken her leg 
and fractured her little finger. Mr.   
Mitchell was informed by Mr. Barrs that
there had been an accident so he went  
straight to Stoke Mandeville Hospital. 
On the seventeenth of July Clare had   
her plaster taken off,but she had to   
have a knee bandage to support her leg.
