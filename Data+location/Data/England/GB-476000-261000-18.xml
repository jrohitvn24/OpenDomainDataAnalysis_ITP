		<content> Along Wellingborough Road are a fish  
and chip shop, butcher and "The        
Trumpet" public house. There are       
established bungalows and houses on    
Ridgeway, also some mock-Tudor thatched
cottages. Down Church Way are some 19th
Century houses and some newer houses.  
There is a tennis club. This           
residential area is well looked        
after. The High Street has old village 
cottages, but most of these have been  
modernised.                            
Bridgewater Drive is a modern estate to
the south of Weston Favell. It has a   
pub called "The Road to Morocco". There
are green spaces, some allotments, a   
small playground and a stream. There is
a middle school, some of the pupils    
coming from a lower school on Church   
Way. Landcross Drive estate has 'bus   
stops, a few shops and a post office.  
It is well kept.                       </content>
