		<title>09Sunday Worship, Cockermouth</title>
		<content> If you require hymns and a sermon in  
 your worship then the Church for you  
 would be the Methodist, Lorton Street.
 This Church, built in 1932, is        
 highlighted by the organ and choir    
 pews with a central pulpit at the     
 front.There is a young minister and an
 above average number of young families
 attend.                               
 If you wish complete freedom in your  
 worship then the Cockermouth Christian
 Fellowship Centre, All Saints' Church 
 Rooms is the place each Sunday        
 afternoon for songs of praise, prayer 
 and guidance on what God wants us to  
 do in the world to-day. Everyone      
 celebrates.                           
 If you wish silent worship then the   
 Religious Society of Friends, Kirkgate
 is the place where members and friends
 meditate, pray or read aloud for an   
 hour in their 1884 Meeting House.     </content>
