		<title>08RECREATION IN BIGGLESWADE</title>
		<content> The 12,000 people who live in and     
 around Biggleswade enjoy a varied     
 range of{clubs &amp; activities}for       
 leisure pursuits. Allotments are in   
 demand &amp; evening classes are always   
 well-attended. Cubs &amp; Scouts, Brownies
 &amp; Guides all have local packs, &amp; there
 is an Air Training Corps, Army Cadet  
 Force, Young Farmers, Gymnastics and  
 Youth Clubs for young people. The     
 Townswomen's Guild  and Darby &amp; Joan  
 Club are perhaps to be expected, along
 with the History Society, Gardening &amp; 
 Camera Clubs, but many specialist pas-
 times are also represented, including 
 the Art Society, Caged Birds &amp; Homing 
 Societies, Old Time Dancing, Flower   
 arranging, Dog Training &amp; Model Rail- 
 ways. Biggleswade &amp; District Choral   
 Society has performed several times   
 with other local groups at the Royal  
 Albert Hall in London.                </content>
