		<content>In more recent times aÂ£Folly'was built 
on the mound presenting a convincing   
replica of a crumbling Norman court-   
yard. Although this is an interesting  
curiosity, the present main attraction 
to visitors lies in the beautiful gard-
ens which are open to visitors on Sun- 
days and Wednesdays.                   
The Lordship does not dominate the vil-
lage with its presence. It lies dis-   
creetly behind high walls and the      
church, although the gates open onto   
the very heart of the Village Green it-
self.                                  
On occasions the Village Green can be  
seen filled with cars and coaches visi-
ting The Benington Lordship.
