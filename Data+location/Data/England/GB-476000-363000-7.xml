		<title>07Old Peoples Bungalows</title>
		<content> Old Peoples Bungalows were built in   
 the village in 1962. There are 22     
 units and 25 tenants at the moment.   
                                    A  
 warden visits the old people every    
 day. She collects their pensions from 
 the post office and does errands for  
 them.                                 
      There is a community room for    
 meetings and social functions.        
                               The     
 District Council built the bungalows. 
 There are links with the Area Health  
 Authority.                            
           Villagers are invited to    
 their bingo sessions. The school      
 invites the old people to social      
 functions.                            
           Each bungalow has its own   
 little garden. The old people all have
 televisions.                          
                                       </content>
