      I get up at 6.45am.  I dress tidy
 my room and have breakfast.  I get    
 ready for school and if theres time   
 I  help Dad look after the poultry    
 goats and cat.  My friend Emma's      
 mother and my mother take  turns to   
 take us and my sister Hannah to       
 school by 8.40.am.                    
      After assembly we do lessons     
 until break at 10.30.  We have lunch  
 at 12.00 until 1.o'clock .I take      
 sandwiches. After lunch lessons again 
 with a break at 2.30 and  we finish   
 at 3.10                               
      After school on Tuesday we have  
 drama club. Sometimes I               
 go to tea with a friend or have one   
 home.we change and have a drink and   
 biscuit. Monday is Brownies.          
 Sometimes if Dad is home we have a    
 bike ride. Bed is at 6.45pm.          </content>
