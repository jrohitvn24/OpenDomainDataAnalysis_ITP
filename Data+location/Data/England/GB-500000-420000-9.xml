		<title>09A WALK TO THE RIVERBANK</title>
		<content>{Observations by an eight year old.}   
                                       
 We went for a walk to the riverbank.  
 We saw a train and a bus at the       
 station. The tide was out and an old  
 boat had paint peeling off. It was on 
 some sinking mud.                     
 The things I liked best were the      
 ladybirds and the wind-surfers. The   
 ladybirds were giving each other a    
 piggyback and they crawled up my arm. 
 A wind surf board is made of fibre    
 glass with one nylon sail. It has a   
 man to steer it who kept falling in   
 the water and another man helped him  
 back onto the board. There was also a 
 man in a canoe stuck in some reeds.   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
