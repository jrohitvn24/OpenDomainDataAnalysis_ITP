		<title>10Greenbooth Reservoir</title>
		<content> Just above Norden is a reservoir which
 used to be the site of Greenbooth     
 village. On the lower dam is a plaque 
 commemorating the little village. The 
 village had a chapel, a school and a  
 small shop as its main features. It   
 sprang up with the industrial         
 revolution and died with it. The mill 
 and surrounding area was owned by the 
 Hutchinsons. Mrs. Hutchinson came     
 round most days to inspect cleanliness
 in the homes. The school was so small 
 that it was run by only two teachers. 
    The methodist preacher John Wesley 
 often stayed at a farmhouse above     
 Greenbooth. A small methodist chapel  
 which he helped to erect was knocked  
 down with the rest of the village in  
 1937.
