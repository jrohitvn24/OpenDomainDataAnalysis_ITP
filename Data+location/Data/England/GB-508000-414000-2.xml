 When I used to live down Ulceby       
 Skitter I went to the station to watch
 the trains.  Mostly the trains are    
 local passenger trains.  I used to    
 count the carriages.  Some of them    
 come from the oil refineries at       
 Immingham.  Their loads are oil and   
 coal from the coal terminal.          
 Sometimes I go to the station to look 
 round and sometimes I pull the levers 
 in the signal box.  We don't get any  
 intercity trains through Ulceby and   
 the reason we can't have them is      
 because they would crash into one of  
 the slow trains.  When we go down the 
 Beck that runs near the railway we    
 sometimes go under one of the bridges.
 When a train goes over it, it is      
 deafening. Our house is right near to 
 the railway line and every night I    
 count the train.There are l3.         </content>
