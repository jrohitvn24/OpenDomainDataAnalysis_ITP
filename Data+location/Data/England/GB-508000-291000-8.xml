		<content> Twelve girls aged between eleven and  
 sixteen belong to 1st Elton All Saints
 Guides which is held at Elton school. 
 The two ladies who run guides come    
 from Southwick and Alwalton.We go for 
 walks down to the river and play      
 rounders using neckerchiefs as posts. 
 If we don't go out then somebody is   
 usually doing a badge which is a test.
 We have three patrols Swallows,Robins 
 and Kingfishers.The uniform is a blue 
 skirt,blue shirt,a yellow neckerchief 
 and a navy hat.We pay 25 pence subs   
 which goes towards buying badges.We go
 to a guide meeting once a week on     
 Tuesday from 6.30 to 8.00.Boys of     
 eleven and over belong to the Boy     
 Scouts movement but there is not a    
 pack in Elton.
