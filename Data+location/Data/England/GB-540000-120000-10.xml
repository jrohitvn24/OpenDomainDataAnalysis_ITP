		<title>10THE SHOPS OF NEWICK</title>
		<content> A strange change has occured to the   
 shops of Newick, since the beginning  
 of the 20th century. Then, as now,    
 they were mostly clustered around the 
 Green, but considering the enormous   
 growth of the population, they have   
 decreased in number, rather than      
 increased. Then there were 2 grocers  
 (both selling furniture, lino and     
 china as well as food), a shoe-mender,
 a hairdresser, 3 butchers, a tailor, 2
 laundries, a wheelwright, 2 bakers,   
 3 blacksmiths and a Post Office. There
 were also many local industries such  
 as glove-making (famous nationally),  
 wagon-making, brewing, building, etc. 
 Today there are just 2 grocers, a DIY 
 shop, a baker, a butcher, a florist, a
 bank, a chemist and 3 estate agents!  
 The main reason for this change is    
 that most people now drive to large   
 supermarkets in bigger towns.         </content>
