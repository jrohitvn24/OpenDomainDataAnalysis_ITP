		<title>04Policing The Shelsleys</title>
		<content>   In this rural area with a low       
 population there is little or no      
 indictable crime. The Shelsleys do not
 have a resident policeman but the area
 is covered from the subpolice station 
 at Great Witley, five miles away and  
 police cars from this or the main     
 station at Stourport, nine miles      
 distant, regularly patrol the valley. 
   The three police officers who live  
 in the vicinity have a good knowledge 
 of the inhabitants of the area. For   
 local problems the police station at  
 Great Witley can be telephoned and    
 when it is not being manned, telephone
 calls are dealt with directly at      
 Stourport or by the 999 system.       
   Four{Justices of the Peace}live in  
 the area and the nearest magistrates' 
 court is held at The Hundred House,   
 Great Witley.
