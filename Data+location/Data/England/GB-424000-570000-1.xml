		<title>01 Wideopen and Killingworth</title>
		<content>Wideopen is a village roughly 5 miles  
north of Newcastle.It is mainly  a     
residential area. There are not a lot  
of leisure facilities or shops in      
Wideopen so many people from Wideopen  
go to Killingworth,a town quite close  
by where there is a large swimming     
pool,a shopping complex and a sports   
centre with many facilities,such as    
badminton,squash,five-a-side football. 
A survey of Fourth Year children at    
Wideopen M.S. showed that Killingworth 
Baths were the most popular in the     
area.Many also used the Sports         
Centre,but Cramlington Leisure Centre  
attracted more users.                  
  Another popular recreational facility
in the area is High Gosforth Park which
5 out of 7 children visit to do        
different activities,jogging,camping,  
golf etc. but most people just go      
walking there.                         </content>
