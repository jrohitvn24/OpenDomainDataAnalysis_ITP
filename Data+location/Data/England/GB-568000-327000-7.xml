		<title>07Sandringham Stud</title>
		<content> The Royal Stud exists for the purpose 
 of breeding racehorses. No current    
 runners are kept there, but about     
 thirty breeding mares are housed at   
 any one time. Foals are born in boxes 
 equipped with closed-circuit T.V. so  
 that a constant watch can be          
 maintained. The latest electronic     
 equipment is used to monitor their    
 health and development. A vetinary    
 surgeon visits the stud daily and the 
 blacksmith monthly.                   
                                       
 The most notable horse resident at the
 present time is Shirley Heights,      
 winner of the 1978 Derby. Other horses
 from France, Ireland, Italy and       
 America are regularly sent to         
 Sandringham for breeding. Visitors to 
 the stud are greeted by the splendid  
 statue of Persimon, winner of many    
 'Classics' in the last century.       </content>
