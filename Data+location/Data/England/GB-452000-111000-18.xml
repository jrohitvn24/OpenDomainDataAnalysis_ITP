		<title>18Professionals in Curdridge.</title>
		<content>      Many professional people live in 
 Curdridge.  We interviewed four of    
 them, a dentist, solicitor, headmaster
 and chairman of an Industrial         
 Tribunal.                             
      The dentist has a surgery in     
 Hedge End.  He has been a dentist for 
 26 years, having trained for five     
 years.  The solicitor works for a     
 firm founded by his great-grandfather 
 nearby in Fareham, helping clients    
 with legal problems.  The headteacher 
 works locally at Swanmore Primary     
 School, which has 300 children and 9  
 full-time teachers. The Chairman of an
 Industrial Tribunal is also the Reader
 at St.Peter's Church.                 
      They all enjoy  working with     
 people, and living in the country.    
 Curdridge is a convenient and pleasant
 area in which to live, and Botley     
 Station makes journeys to London easy.</content>
