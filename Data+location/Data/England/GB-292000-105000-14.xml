		<title>14THE CHANGING VILLAGE</title>
		<content> For centuries there was little change 
 in rural life in Devon. But since the 
 turn of the century{everything}has    
 changed. An old resident tells of the 
 school of four teachers and seventy   
 children, aged four to thirteen. All  
 pupils attended Sunday School as a    
 matter of course. The annual school   
 "treat" was a trip to the seaside.    
 Families had seven or more children.  
 Boys went to work on farms, girls to  
 do domestic duties. The village then  
 had shops, bakery, etc. but folk then 
 needing large purchases would walk six
 km to Tiverton. The doctor was at Sil-
 verton, seven km. Electricity was     
 introduced in 1950; and before mains  
 water two or three cottages shared    
 wells. Life is now more easy, but     
 close friendships, contentment and    
 homemade fun have gone, and this is   
 regretted.                            </content>
