		<content> We play one game called "kingey".     
 People make a circle and you drop the 
 ball in the middle. You have to try   
 to kick it through each other's legs. 
 You say, "high, low or on the spot"   
 then throw the ball at each other. If 
 the ball hits you you are "on", and   
 you have to chase the others.         
  "British Bulldog" is where one person
 is a catcher and all the other people 
 run across from one side to the other.
 If the catcher catches someone then   
 they are "on" as well until everyone  
 is caught.                            
  We play "Lacrosse" on Fridays. You   
 have a stick with a net on the end    
 with which you catch the ball and     
 shoot it into the net. The man who    
 takes us is an American called Steve. 
 He plays for Urmston Lacrosse Club and
 said he will give us information on   
 joining his club.                     </content>
