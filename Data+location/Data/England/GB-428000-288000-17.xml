		<title>17ARLEY COLLIERY 1904-1968</title>
		<content> Opened 1904,the colliery was situated 
 in an easily mined site in the upper  
 coal measures of the East Warks.      
 plateau. Later superceded by Dawmill  
 locally it gave rise to the village of
 New Arley as it is today. The houses  
 were built on the hillside with the   
 pithead in the valley below. At its   
 height in 1939-1960 over 1000 men were
 employed.                             
 At around this time other collieries  
 were developing and mining became the 
 source of work an influence on the    
 culture of the area.                  
 In 1968 the pit was closed which      
 caused some hardship in the area      
 although transfers to other pits could
 be made. In 1980 an industrial estate 
 was opened on the site of the colliery
 to encourage jobs. In 1982 1 in 6 of  
 the labour force were unemployed.
