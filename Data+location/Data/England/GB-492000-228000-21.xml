There is now only 1 local news paper the long running Leighton Buzzard Observer. Now administered from offices in Luton. The current cost is 50p. A sister news paper The Citizen is a free paper but circulation is very patchy with many areas not receiving any copies. &lt;br />&lt;br />The local radio is provided by BBC 3 Counties Radio from its studios in Luton. Television continues to be provided by the BBC and ITV and parts of Leighton can connect to Virgin Media's cable net work. All are now digital and have High Definition channels. Residents can also tune in to Sky T.V. mainly a subsciption service again multi channel and many High Definition. They need a satilite dish.   &lt;br />
