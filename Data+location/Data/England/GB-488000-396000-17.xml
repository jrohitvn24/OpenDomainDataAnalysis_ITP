		<title>17S/N - Village Events</title>
		<content> Events in the two villages tend to be 
 for fund-raising - for church, village
 hall, a village organisation or some  
 outside charity.   Support is given   
 readily on the day, though help with  
 preparations is sometimes harder to   
 find.  Northorpe fetes (for church,   
 chapel or playground) are held at     
 Northorpe Manor and at the Old Rectory
 and at Scotton an annual fete is held 
 (at Manor Farm) in aid of village hall
 funds. Both villages have held success
 -ful "Bygones" Weekends Scotton's run 
 by the WI who have also held two very 
 popular Craft Weekends, in conjunction
 with a Flower Festival at the church. 
 A Mowers' Supper is held each year in 
 Scotton as the PCC's way of thanking  
 those who keep the churchyard tidy    
 (regular motor mowing and two hand    
 cuts - with sycthes). There is usually
 also some form of Harvest Supper.     </content>
