		<title>18THE RESERVOIR SOUTH REIGATE</title>
		<content>     In 1859 the Reigate Waterworks C0 
 was formed to supply water to a large 
 part of Reigate.The works and Pumping 
 Station were situated in "Sandy Lane" 
 now known as Lyttleton Lane,a turning 
 off Park Lane.The water was collected 
 via a number of shallow wells,situated
 on the north side of a foot path lead_
 ing from Park Lane near the overflow  
 from Priory Lake.The supply of water  
 started from the bottom of the hills  
 that lie to the north of Reigate and  
 through various channels finally reach
 -ed "the moors"on Reigate Heath.      
     The water was then pumped to the  
 large reservoir on the west end of    
 Park Ridge.It is a brick tank which   
 holds 83,000 gallons.This tank is now 
 used for water regulating machinery.  
 The pumping house still stands as a   
 private house.
