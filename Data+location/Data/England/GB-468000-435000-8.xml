 through the door and hang up your     
 outdoor coat on a peg.When you walk   
 into the living room you will see a   
 television screen showing pictures for
 entertainment and a sofa and arm      
 chairs for sitting on.In the kitchen  
 where food is prepared there will be a
 cooker or a microwave oven for cooking
 meals.There will be a pantry to keep  
 your food in, and a table and         
 chairs.Under the stairs you will      
 usually find a vacuum cleaner to help 
 you clean up around the house and a   
 washing machine to help you clean     
 clothes.There will be a fridge and    
 freezer where you can keep food for a 
 long time.When you go upstairs there  
 will be bedrooms,with beds to sleep in
 and wardrobes to store clothes in.Also
 upstairs there is a bathroom with
