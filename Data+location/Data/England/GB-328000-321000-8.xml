		<title>08People Of Maesbrook Village</title>
		<content>   The shop and post office had been   
 closed down and the locals missed it  
 because they had to travel out of the 
 village to get their shopping.        
 They all thought that Oswestry was a  
 lovely town  but some thought that it 
 has been spoilt by all the new roads  
 and buildings.None of them worked     
 there because they were all retired.  
   They had all come from big towns and
 cities e.g.Wolverhampton,to retire in 
 the country.They rarely went out for  
 any entertainment and only went to    
 Oswestry for shopping 2-3 times a     
 week.They all travelled by car.       
   The only bus ran on a Wednesday from
 Maesbrook to Oswestry at 10am         
 returning at 2pm.The people of        
 Maesbrook were very happy where they  
 lived and were very friendly towards  
 each other and ready to answer our    
 questions.                            </content>
