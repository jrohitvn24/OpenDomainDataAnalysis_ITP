 14% of the fathers work in the area   
 covered by our survey; at Reeve       
 Burgess (coach builders), Pugh Lewis  
 (drainage, fencing &amp; haulage          
 contractors), Ashton Containers (paper
 &amp; board manufacturers) and Shaw's     
 (builders).                           
                                       
 8% are self-employed, 3 being farmers.
                                       
 The remainder of jobs range from      
 engineering workers to public service 
 workers, teachers and managerial      
 staff. The father who travelled       
 furthest to work was a North Sea oil  
 rig worker.                           
                                       
 10% of the fathers were unemployed.
