		<title>18Saint John's Church</title>
		<content>  On Friday July 5th, we went to visit 
{St. John's Church. Reverend S. Oram}  
 (the Curate) was our guide.           
  The{church}was built in two parts,   
 the first was constructed of blue or  
 black brick in 1842-43 and the second 
 part, of sandstone was added in 1894. 
 The building is already starting to   
 crumble due to weather and pollution. 
  Then we went to the{Altar}and found  
 out that the first Vicar of the church
 was buried underneath.                
  Recently the church was re-ordered   
 and the{organ}and{choir stalls}were   
 moved to a new{gallery.}Mrs Thomas-Cox
 surprised us by playing a few tunes!  
  In the{Aumbry}there was bread and    
 wine which had been blessed by the    
{Priest. The Vestry}held the registers 
 of baptisms,deaths and marriages.     
  In the{Lady Chapel}we saw a beautiful
 carving of{Jesus}at the{Last Supper.  </content>
