		<title>10UNI.OF LONDON OBSERVATORY</title>
		<content>   The Observatory was opened in 1929  
 and stands beside the A1 (A41) at Mill
 Hill. The building houses various     
 telescopes used by students on a rota 
 basis both for observation and        
 operational training.                 
   The main telescopes are a 1974 24"  
 Reflector called the 'Allen',after a  
 past director,and a 1901 18" and 24"  
 Double Refractor called the           
 'Radcliffe' which came from Radcliff  
 College, Oxford. Both of the          
 telescopes can be kept on the path of 
 the star under observation by         
 electronic control. There is also an  
 8" Refractor called the 'Fry' made in 
 1862 and a 6"Refractor called the     
 'Joysons' made in 1863.Both of these  
 have clockwork gravity driven         
 mechanical controls.                  
   There is an annex at Daws Lane which
 houses the computing facilities.      </content>
