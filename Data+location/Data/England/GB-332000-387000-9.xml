		<title>09ANGLICAN CATHEDRAL</title>
		<content> On{Sunday}most people on Merseyside go
 to{church.}The two most famous        
 churches in Liverpool are the         
{Metropolitan (Catholic) Cathedral and 
{the Anglican Cathedral.}The latter is 
 built of rich red sandstone quarried  
 in Woolton, Liverpool 25 and it rises 
 high over the city on{St. James's     
{Mount.}The foundation stone was laid  
 on{19th July 1904}by King Edward VII. 
 The architect,{Sir Gilbert Scott}is   
 long since dead and the work was      
 finally completed in 1984. Some stone 
 masons have spent their{entire working
{lives}helping to build this cathedral,
 which is one of the most beautiful    
 churches of modern times. The huge    
{vaulted roofs}are truly remarkable and
 the view from the top of the tower is 
 never to be forgotten. In 1985 a      
{housing development}has been started  
 on derelict land at its very feet.    </content>
