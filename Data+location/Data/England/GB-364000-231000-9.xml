		<title>09Much Marcle Church</title>
		<content> Much Marcle Church dates from the 13th
 century and is built of local         
 sandstone.It has a tower with         
 gargoyles which is traditionally      
 believed to have been built from      
 stones taken from Mortimers Castle.The
 site of the castle is only 50 yards   
 north of the church.There are two     
 interesting features in the church.The
 first is the Kyrle Chapel which was   
 built in the 13th century and houses  
 the Kyrle tomb.The second feature is a
 rare wooden monumental effigy of a man
 in 14th century costume.Outside the   
 church there is a saxon cross which   
 was there before the church was built 
 and is where the Saxon villagers      
 worshiped.In the graveyard there is a 
 huge yew tree with a hollow trunk     
 which is 200yrs old.In the hollow     
 there is a bench where you can sit.
