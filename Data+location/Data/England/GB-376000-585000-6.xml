		<content> Greenhaugh is a hamlet of 14 dwellings
 clustered around the Holly Bush Inn   
 and with the school on the outskirts. 
 Most of the hamlet formed part of the 
 Greenhaugh estate and when this was   
 recently sold, some of the tenants    
 took the opportunity to buy their     
 homes. Most of the houses are         
 traditional stone and slate. One new  
 bungalow is stone-faced. 5 are        
 detached dwellings, 2 semi-detached, 3
 form a terrace and 4 a row opposite.  
 There is a telephone kiosk and a post 
 box. The houses are occupied by;      
 working families with children - 3,   
 working families without children - 4,
 retired people - 6, vacant at present 
 - 1. Social life centres at the Holly 
 Bush and the school. Twenty years ago 
 there was a shop, post office and     
 forestry office. These have all closed
 but now there is the school &amp; a garage</content>
