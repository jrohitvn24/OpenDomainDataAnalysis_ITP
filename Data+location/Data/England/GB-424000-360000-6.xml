		<content> Mr.Hardey is a livestock farmer.He    
 breeds dairy cows on his farm.His     
 cows are milked by machines which fit 
 over the teats and suck out the       
 milk.His milking times are 6.00 am and
 4.45 pm.Mr.Hardy has 114 acres of land
 to graze his cows on.He has{90 cattle}
 in his herd.He has {one }helper on his
 farm.He first started farming in{1935 
 .The reason for him wanting to work on
 a farm was because it was a family    
 tradition.Now he has been farming for 
 50 years.Every day after milking he   
 takes the milk and puts it in a       
 machine.This stirs it up and heats it 
 the heat kills the germs.The milk     
 stays in the machine until the tanker 
 comes.To take it away.
