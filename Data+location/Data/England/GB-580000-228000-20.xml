		<content> Gala Day was on the first Saturday in 
 July. The parade started at two       
 o'clock. The carnival queen and her   
 princess had new dresses, sashes and  
 crowns on. They drove in an old       
 fashioned car with the roof down so   
 that everyone could see them. The     
 route they took was down Mitchell's   
 Avenue, along King's Road, up         
 Parsonage Street and then down the    
 centre of the town to the town        
 gardens. The car broke down and this  
 embaressed the queen and princess. The
 people all cheered them along the     
 route. In the town gardens Jayne, the 
 queen, presented the trophies to the  
 winners of the various competitions.  
 Gala Day is always a happy day for all
 the family. There are decorated       
 floats in the parade and lots of      
 things to do throughout the day.
