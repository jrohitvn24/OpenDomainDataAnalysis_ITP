		<content>                                       
 Withiel Farm is right in the middle   
 of the Somerset countryside.It is a   
 modern sheep farm because he does not 
 have the traditional hill breeds,but  
 instead he has{700}'Mules'. The farm  
 covers{320 acres.}One of the main     
 attractions of the open countryside is
 hardly ever hearing a car. His        
 neighbour lives 100 yards up the      
 road, but he has only seen him 4 or 5 
 times in 2 years. He used to grow     
 corn, but due to heavy rain in this   
 area, he gave it up. For two months   
 every year,the family go abroad while 
 a farm manager looks after the farm.  
 They make silage twice a year, but    
 straw has to be bought at Williton.   
 For every 1 ram there are 30 ewes.    
 They lamb in mid_March.During Winter  
 the sheep are fed silage and mineral  
 cake.                                 </content>
