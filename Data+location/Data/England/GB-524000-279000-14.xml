		<content> Great and Little Raveley and Wistow   
 have no airfields but close by are two
 Royal Air Force Wyton, with Canberra  
 and Nimrod aeroplanes and Royal Air   
 Force Alconbury, which is used by the 
 American Air Force as a base for      
 Phantom A 10, and PR 1 aeroplanes.    
 The flight path for landing and taking
 off at the bases overlaps the airspace
 of Great and Little Raveley and       
 Wistow.  The aircraft are of service  
 type and jet powered.  This causes    
 noise pollution in an otherwise quiet 
 rural area.  Service personnel and    
 vehicles use the roads in the area but
 cause no major problems.  Servicemen  
 also rent property which brings extra 
 money to the community of the Raveleys
 and Wistow.  The Air Force bases give 
 a limited amount of employment to a   
 minority of people in this lightly    
 populated area.                       </content>
