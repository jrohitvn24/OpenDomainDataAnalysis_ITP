		<content>     People are becoming much more     
 fashion conscious than they used to be
 The look for this summer is bright,   
 casual and sporty. The traditional    
 rugby shirt has become the basis for  
 many different styles of casual shirts
 Loose fitting and baggy shorts are    
 another new look for this summer.     
 Todays colours are lemon, turquoise,  
 vivid reds, blues, white and pink.    
     Pop stars and night club goers    
 wear very expensive and fashionable   
 clothes. Gone are traditional         
 stereotypes; women dress up in manish 
 clothes. Many men are now growing     
 their hair and wearing jewellry such  
 as earrings. It may only be a natural 
 progression for men to be wearing     
 skirts. The high street fashion chains
 are now expanding their stocks for    
 this possibility.
