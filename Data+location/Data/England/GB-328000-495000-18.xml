 from{tourism,}as hoteliers, guest     
 house owners, shopkeepers, etc. Other 
 main avenues of employment are:       
 quarrying, jobs in shops &amp; hotels,    
 domestic services, the building trade,
 farming and local authority work. Some
 people{travel}to Ambleside or         
 Ulverston and Barrow to work. A high  
 proportion of people are              
{self-employed.                        
{EDUCATION:}There are two schools in   
 Coniston: the Church of England       
{Primary}School, and John Ruskin       
{Secondary}School. There is also a     
{Playgroup}for children over 3. There  
 is no sixth form at John Ruskin, so   
 pupils have to travel to Ulverston to 
 take A Level courses. One family in   
 the village teach their three primary 
 age children at home.                 </content>
