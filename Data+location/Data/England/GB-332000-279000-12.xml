		<title>12LEISURE IN THE CLUNTON AREA</title>
		<content> For many people leisure means active  
 exercise. Gardening is one            
 particularly worth mentioning though  
 many would dispute the word leisure   
 used in this context. There is an     
 active painting and drawing group in  
 Clunton encouraged by a local         
 professional artist. They meet        
 regulary and regulary exhibit at      
 local exhibtions and shows.           
 Handicrafts are an important outlet   
 for some as is shown by the high      
 standard of work in the Purslow Show. 
    There is a wealth of walks in the  
 area for those with a love of exercise
 or a dog. For those with transport and
 the inclination there are other       
 activities within reach, music,       
 societies, bell ringing, bowls,       
 amateur dramatics and Women's         
 Institute. For the young there are    
 Youth Clubs in Clunbury and Clun.     </content>
