		<title>13ST.MARGARET'S CHURCH HALL</title>
		<content>      St. Margaret's Church Hall was   
 opened in 1963 by the Bishop of       
 Lincoln. The hall was paid for with   
 money bequeathed by the Misses May and
 Mildred Robinson.                     
      When built it was used for church
 events as the old Parish Hall was     
 still in existence. The latter fell in
 to gross disrepair and was closed and 
 sold - a house now occupying this     
 site.                                 
     Village events moved to St.       
 Margaret's Church Hall. Its modern    
 uses, under the management            
 committee,are                         
 dancing,weddings,Evergreen Club,      
 bingo. whist drives and occasional    
 school functions and general parties. 
     Within the hall is a chapel which 
 is used for Sunday worship between    
 Christmas and Easter.
