		<content>   A gradual decline has occured in    
 attendance at the 2 Methodist         
 chapels.In 1983 the chapel at Minard  
 Cross was closed for regular          
 worship.Downderry has 19 'official'   
 Church members who are presently      
 sponsoring extensive renovations of   
 the building.Finances are good,from   
 event and donation income.            
  Several interdenominational services 
 are organised e.g A Methodist/Anglican
 Sunday School of 12 children.The      
 annual events like the Harvest of the 
 Sea service,the Harvest Festival and  
 the Candlelight Carol service still   
 fill the chapel to capacity.          
  From 1980 to 85 the chapel had it's  
 first female ordained Minister.This   
 popular cleric,the Rev.Joan Ryland has
 very recently been replaced ,and an   
 pastoral assistant has been appointed,
 to work and live locally.             </content>
