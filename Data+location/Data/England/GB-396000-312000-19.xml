		<content>School Assemblies are taken by the head
teacher, Mr. Meades. We have two hymns,
a prayer and a story about Jesus or    
characters from the Old Testament.     
Sometimes we hear about a famous person
who is remembered for some good deed.  
Each Friday a different class takes it 
in turn to give an assembly. I do not  
go into Assembly because I am a        
Jehovah's Witness. Instead my Mom or   
Dad comes into school to take our group
of eight. We read out of our           
 ublication 'My Book of Bible Stories'.
Some evenings and weekends I go out    
calling on people with my parents.     
The school choir sometimes gives       
services around the different churches 
and at school. We sing songs about     
various bible stories, and carols at   
 hristmas. We performed 'Jerusalem Joy'
 t Easter and we have also done 'Jonah 
Man Jazz' about Jonah and the whale.   </content>
