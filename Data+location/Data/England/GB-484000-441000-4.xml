		<content>      The centre of Market Weighton was
 mainly rebuilt between l780-l850 in   
 brick with pantile roof; only a small 
 number had slate roofs.  Increased    
 traffic early in the 20th century led 
 to demolition and deterioration of    
 property.  Most of the derelict and   
 sub-standard housing had been         
 demolished by l985.  New developments 
 of brick and tile occurred off all    
 major roads and these were insular by 
 nature as no connecting roads or      
 footpaths were incorporated in the    
 plans.  The latest housing trend for  
 small town houses suitable for first  
 time buyers or pensioners, this spate 
 of new building seems to have abated  
 for the time being.  Approx. 66% of   
 the 1,373 properties were owner       
 occupied and the remainder were mainly
 Council owned.
