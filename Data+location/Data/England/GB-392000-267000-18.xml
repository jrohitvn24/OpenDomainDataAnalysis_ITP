		<title>18NARROWBOAT HOME,STOKE PRIOR</title>
		<content> I have lived on a{narrowboat}since I  
 was two and a half years old.The boat 
 is fifty years old and 21.6m long.It  
 used to carry coal on the Grand Union 
 Canal from London to Birmingham.It has
 a motor and used to pull a butty which
 was originally paired with ours. We   
 have a Rayburn cooker in the kitchen  
 which heats the radiators,and a turtle
 stove in one of the bedrooms. In the  
 winter the boat is usually much warmer
 than a house.We have no mains         
 electricity, but run the lights and   
 the television from 12 volt batteries.
 Water is stored in big tanks under the
 floor.We keep the coal in the forward 
 hatch or on the roof.                 
      Sometimes it is fun living on a  
 narrowboat, especially when we are    
 moving, but sometimes I would rather  
 live in a nice house with a garden.
