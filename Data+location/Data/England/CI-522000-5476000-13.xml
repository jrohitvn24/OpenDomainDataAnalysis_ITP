		<title>13MRS.SILTON'S NATURE RESERVE</title>
		<content> Mrs. Silton's{Nature Reserve}is above 
 L'Eree Bay. In the Nature Reserve     
 there is a{Kingfisher}that hovers over
 our pond, and it tries to catch the   
{trout,}but the fish are too fast for  
 it.  We have seen birds in the pond   
 looking for the fish, but the biggest 
 bird was a{Heron,} which is grey in   
 colour and has a long beak.  He is a  
 very powerful bird. There is a special
 place where we can go and watch the   
 birds. Some of the types we have seen 
 are Sparrows,Crows,lots of varieties  
 of Tits, Pigeons, Starlings and most  
 of all the Thrush.There are also many 
 bats but I have only seen two or      
 three.In the early spring there are   
 many daffodils and sometimes we go and
 pick some flowers for Mrs. Silton.
