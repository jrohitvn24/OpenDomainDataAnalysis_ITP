		<title>01HILLS WEST OF HARWOOD DALE</title>
		<content> The east section is lowest and has the
 most farms and habitation along the   
 only tarmac road and the Lownorth Park
 Valley . Pleasant mixed farmland and  
 deciduous woods and in north east a   
 large coniferous plantation. The south
 has deciduous woods and are dominated 
 by high flat topped forested hills to 
 the south. The south east section is  
 planted with conifers and the north   
 east risen up to heather dominated    
 moorland beyond the large grass fields
 on the slope. The residents are nearly
 all farmers and there are no villages 
 so most of the land is used for       
 farming and forestry and perhaps      
 grouse shooting in the north east. A  
 motorcycle club also runs owns some   
 land at Lownorth Park. The whole block
 is in National Park and attracts      
 tourists for the day to walk and enjoy
 the countryside.                      </content>
