		<content>   There used to be a lot of trees on  
 the surrounding moors, but now there  
 are only a few small ones left because
 the others have been chopped down by  
 the striking miners who needed the    
 wood for fuel in the cold winter      
 months of last year.                  
   Moorends is not one of the most     
 picturesque villages I have ever seen,
 but I would not live anywhere else.   
                                       
            {THORNE MOORS.}            
   Thorne moors was once peatland      
 covering thousands of acres known as  
 Inclesmoor. Today, after being reduced
 by reclamation for farmland and       
 exploited by Fisons for it's peat, it 
 covers an area of about 5,250 acres.  
   The area is roughly bounded by      
 Goole, Crowle and Thorne and is       
 divided by parish boundaries so that  
 each share has a name e.g.Crowle Moor,</content>
