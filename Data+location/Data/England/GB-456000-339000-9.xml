		<title>09NOTTINGHAM - ALFRETON ROAD</title>
		<content> Alfreton Road leads to lots of        
 different places like the M1 which is 
 the motorway through Nottingham.It    
 also leads to the centre of town.This 
 is partly why the road is so busy.    
 Another reason is the variety of shops
 and restaurants.There are Indian,     
 Italian, and Chinese restaurants and  
 lots more.There also chip shops and   
 various take away shops.There are     
 plenty of pubs.One is called "The     
 Generous Britain", another "The       
 Running Horse".                       
 I think Alfreton Road is a very dirty 
 place, but it's not surprising because
 the food shops just dump their rubbish
 in the alleyways.The best shop for me 
 on Alfreton Road is Temple's          
 Newsagent.It sells everything a       
 newsagent should.
