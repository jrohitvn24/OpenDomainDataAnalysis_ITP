		<content> On Saturday I went to Southampton to  
 the Solent Spitfires which is a BMX   
 racing club.  I got in free because I 
 got a free ticket with Barcleys bank. 
 It was a nice BMX course because it   
 was big.                              
 There was a man called Tim March who  
 is a world famous BMX rider.  He and  
 his two friends did a display of      
 freestyle which is another word for   
 stunts.                               
 There was a three year old boy called 
 Jamie.  In all the races he went in   
 he won.  At about half past four we   
 got special lessons on how to do the  
 course well.  The man who showed us   
 was called Woppa.                     
 In all the races I went in I came     
 fourth, but in the first race I was   
 third and I slipped my pedal and came 
 fourth.  After that we all went home.
