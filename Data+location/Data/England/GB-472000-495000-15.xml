		<content> The{houses and cottages}in the village
 are mainly stone and slate and are    
 clustered around two areas of grass.  
 The centre green has an impressive    
 sycamore. The dwellings are, in the   
 main, grouped in terraces. Some of the
 houses have a lancet window at first  
 floor level with a matching fanlight  
 over the door. This is typical of     
 Victorian architecture and is         
 from the days when Rosedale was an    
 important ironstone mining area. Some 
 of the remains of the old mines and   
 railway track may still be seen.      
 The Bow Bridge at the foot of Chimney 
 Bank,(1:3) is 17th.Century.           
{The National Park Committee}is the    
 local planning authority and aims to  
 protect the attractive features such  
 as the buildings, building patterns,  
 trees and open spaces which go to make
 up the character of the place.        </content>
