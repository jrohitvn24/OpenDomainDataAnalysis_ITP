      We did a survey of shops in our  
area. There is a wide variety of       
family owned shops and one very large  
supermarket called Booths. The         
residential area in our block is about 
20min. walk from the town centre which 
may explain the number of shops. The   
busiest small shop was the greengrocer.
People interviewed said they liked to  
choose their own fresh fruit. Both the 
small shops and Booths said their      
busiest day was Saturday. The small    
shops employed about 5 people each and 
Booths employed 92 staff. Most people  
said they did one large shop per week  
and 3/4 of Booths shoppers said they   
usually shopped there and lived        
nearby. We counted 90 cars in the      
car-park. The Booths in our area was   
opened in 1982 but the Booths company  
was started in Preston, in 1847.       </content>
