		<title>16The Game 'Elastics'</title>
		<content> Elastics is a game played by three    
 girls or boys, where you take a piece 
 of strong elastic, about one and a    
 half metres long, tie the ends        
 together and then stretch the elastic 
 above the ankles but below the shins  
 of two people standing about a metre  
 apart.  The elastic should then make a
 narrow rectangular shape around the   
 two people's legs.  The idea of the   
 game is to jump in and out of the     
 elastic shape without touching it with
 your feet.  The movement is done to a 
 spoken rhyme.  If you complete the    
 saying of the rhyme without letting   
 your feet touch the elastic, you are  
 allowed to go on to a higher level,   
 with the elastic at knee height.  The 
 increase in height continues until the
 person jumping gets caught out.
