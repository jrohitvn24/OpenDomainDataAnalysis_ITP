		<content>  In our survey about peoples'         
 opinions it was thought that          
 unemployment was the biggest problem  
 for the local area, and the country.  
 Many people thought that unequal      
 sharing of the world's resources was  
 the main problem for the world. Many  
 people thought problems connected with
 travel were important.Some of these   
 were poor road surfaces,inadequate bus
 services and car parking because of   
 the increase in tourism. Many people  
 were concerned about crime            
 particularly in our local area and    
 the country as a whole,probably due to
 unemployment. Two other problems      
 mentioned were concerned with         
 education and conservation. World     
 issues of concern were connected with 
 poverty, selfishness, greed and over  
 population.Another problem was the    
 threat of nuclear war.                </content>
