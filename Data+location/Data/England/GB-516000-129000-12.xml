		<content> Changing times:Horsham 1945-1985      
 Shopping:In 1945 most shops were owned
 by families, like Hunts. Few still    
 exist. Most shops are now owned by    
 companies. It would be difficult to   
 buy foreign foods. Most food was      
 bought at corner shops. Now people go 
 to supermarkets, Sainsburys or Tesco. 
 Today people have freezers. In 1945   
 there were no frozen food or          
 freezer shops.                        
 Transport:The main type of transport  
 in 1945 was the bicycle. There were   
 more buses and trains in 1945 than    
 now.  The roads have changed a lot.   
 You were able to drive straight       
 through Horsham. Now West St. is      
 pedestrianized and we now have a      
 distributor road-Albion Way.          
 Leisure:In 1945 there were 3 cinemas  
 Ritz, Odeon or Capital, now only the  
 Ritz has not been demolished.         </content>
