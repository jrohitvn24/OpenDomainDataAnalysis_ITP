		<title>19Saturday night at the cinema</title>
		<content>Since the school holiday started I had 
been bored. After a few days all my    
friends went on holiday. My dad said   
that on saturday we would all go to the
cinema. The days went slowly and I was 
very impatient. On Saturday we left    
home at 7 p.m. and caught a bus which  
took 40 minutes to get to the West End 
in London. It was dark when we got to  
the Odeon in Leicester Square and      
joined the line to go in. After about  
10 minutes we were in the waiting room.
I bought some pop-corn and a drink. We 
had to wait again while the rubbish    
left by people who had seen the film   
earlier was cleared.The film we saw was
"2010" It was about space and was      
really good. Then we ate hamburgers and
got home very late.At last I went to   
bed, sorry that Saturday was over but  
glad that I was going swimming the next
morning.                               </content>
