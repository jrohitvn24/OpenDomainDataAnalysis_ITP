		<title>03Mr.Watson-farming-publicity</title>
		<content>   Farmers are better informed now due 
 to farming magazines,local radio      
 (Cumbria is especially good) visiting 
 speakers and television.As a member of
 the Milk Marketing Board Mr.Watson    
 spends a lot of time away from his    
 farm giving lectures and attending    
 meetings.He goes to S.E.England two   
 days every month to Board meetings.   
   He thinks that farmers often get bad
 publicity,much of it unjustified,and  
 in fact most farmers try to improve   
 the quality of their products and to  
 conserve wild life.                   
   Mr.Watson enjoys farming but he also
 likes meeting people and working      
 outside his farm for the general good 
 of agriculture.                       
   His eldest son recently left school 
 and will,after careful farming        
 experience and further education      
 follow in "father's footsteps."       </content>
