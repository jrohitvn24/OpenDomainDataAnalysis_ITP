		<content> I have my breakfast in the{sitting    
{room.}I have my breakfast{there       
 because I live in a Hotel and my Mum  
 and Dad are always busy.{Most people  
 have their breakfast in the kitchen. I
 have fried bread, fried egg and baked 
 beans for my breakfast. My brother    
 Vincent usually has his breakfast at  
 the same time as me. He has branflakes
 which is a cereal. You have to pour   
 milk and put sugar on cereal. Vincent 
 and I usually talk and sometimes we   
 watch televison. The programme is     
 called Breakfast Time, it is a news   
 programme. While I am getting ready   
 for school, collecting books and      
 getting my lunch box ready, Vincent   
 and Sarah, my sister, are also getting
 ready for school and my Mum and Dad   
 would be working in the Hotel.
