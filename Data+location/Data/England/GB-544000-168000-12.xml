		<title>12Scadbury Park.</title>
		<content>Scadbury Park covers about 300 acres   
and lies between Chislehurst and St.   
Pauls Cray.It originally belonged to   
Scadbury Manor.It consists of woodland 
and farmland.It was bought by the      
Borough of Bromley in 1983 to be turned
into a nature reserve.                 
The woods include some very old oak and
yew trees.The woods are very neglected.
Bromley Council plans to improve the   
area by getting rid of diseased trees  
and thinning out the undergrowth.      
Footpaths are going to be made,along   
with picnic areas.                     
The rest of the area is mainly pasture 
land.This part of the estate will be   
rented  out to farmers.Hedges will be  
left to provide a refuge for wildlife. 
Foxes,badgers and rabbits are very     
common,as well as many types of birds. 
There are also some ponds which have   
moorhens,frogs,newts and dragonflies.  </content>
