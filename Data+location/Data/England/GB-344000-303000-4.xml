		<content> of the total cost of Â£1,500.The Font. 
 "There appear to have been two earlier
 fonts,one was found under the pump at 
 the Blacksmith's yard opposite and was
 a mutilated eight-sided bowl without  
 any ornament."The Bells.There were two
 bells in 1552 and three in 1752.Two of
 the latter were recast in 1722 and    
 1736.The church still had three bells 
 in 1906 but there are now six,two of  
 which were acquired in 1948.Since 1867
 the music was supplied by a{harmonium,
 but in the 1940's the present organ   
 was purchased from Longnor Hall,the   
 property of Major Corbett,thus greatly
 compressing the space of the vestry.  
 There are approx.60 people who live in
 Stapleton but only 20 or so attend    
 this fascinating church.
