		<title>09BILLING AQUADROME (South).</title>
		<content>   At the height of the season,{half a 
{million people}pass through the main  
 gate of the Aquadrome. What was       
 originally farmland has now been      
 turned into an area dedicated to water
 sports, caravaning and amusements.    
   The Aquadrome owes its origin to the
{Ice Age}which left sand and gravel in 
 deep pockets across much of Eastern   
 England. When the sand and gravel was 
 later excavated the craters were      
 filled with water, stocked with fish  
 and the surrounding lips landscaped.  
 Lines of{Willows}make an attractive   
 backdrop to the 1200 static units. The
 marina has space for 200 boats.       
   The season lasts from late March    
 until late October and employs 200    
 people at its height. During week-ends
 and at holiday times locals enjoy the 
 pleasant surrounds. During September  
 over{1000 people enjoy the Fun Run.   </content>
