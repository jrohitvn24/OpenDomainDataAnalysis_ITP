		<content>    OUR JOURNEY OFF THE A38 THROUGH    
BIDDISHAM VILLAGE WAS ALONG A ROAD NEW 
TO THOSE OF US TAKING PART.            
    FOR THE FIRST KM WE PASSED LARGE   
COTTAGES SET IN THEIR OWN GROUNDS AMID 
FLOWERS,FRUIT TREES AND VEGETABLES.WE  
LEFT THE HOUSES TO FIND THE ROAD       
FOLLOWING THE COURSE OF THE OLD RIVER  
AXE.THE RIVER WAS FULL AS IT TWISTED   
AND TURNED TO JOIN THE MAIN RIVER.     
    THE FIELDS ALONGSIDE THE RIVER WERE
RICH WITH GRASS.SOME FIELD HAD BEEN    
CROPPEDAND BALES OF HAY WERE AWAITING  
COLLECTION.                            
    COWS BROWSED ALONGSIDE THE RIVER OR
LAY CONTENDEDLY CHEWING.               
    WITH THE SUN SHINING,THE LANDSCAPE 
INVITED US TO LINGER RATHER THAN       
CONTINUE OUR EXPLORATION.              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
