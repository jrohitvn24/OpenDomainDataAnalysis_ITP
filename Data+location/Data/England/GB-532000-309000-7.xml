		<content> A long time ago there used to be a    
 blacksmith at Glass-house farm.Then it
 was turned into a pub, now it is a    
 farm house with people living in it.  
    There used to be a lot of          
 carpenters around, now there are not  
 so many.                              
    The farmers used to work horses    
 instead of tractors like they have    
 now.                                  
    It used to be marsh and fenland    
 around here then the land was drained.
 There are a lot of drains and dykes   
 around now so it doesn't flood.They   
 had to dig the dykes out with spades  
 because draglines weren't invented    
 then.                                 
    All the farming in the old days    
 used to be done by horses and hand.The
 seed sowing usd to be done by hand,so 
 did the weeding.Now most weeds are    
 killed by chemical sprays.            </content>
