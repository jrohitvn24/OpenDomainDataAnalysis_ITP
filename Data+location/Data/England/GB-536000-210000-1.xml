		<content> This dominantly rural area, lying in  
 the Metropolitan Green Belt between   
 the Old London Road &amp; the Lea         
 Valley has varied land use. The main  
 rural industry is agriculture. Farms  
 are mainly livestock grazing with     
 arable crops for fodder. Some land is 
 under glass. Farms are under pressure 
 from demands of outdoor recreation.   
 Conflicts arise from over used rights 
 of way, land fragmentation, trespass, 
 vandalism, &amp; rustling. Woodlands are  
 extensive but often run-down through  
 lack of management &amp; Dutch Elm        
 Disease. Aggregate extraction vies    
 with recreation, water supply &amp;       
 agriculture to create landscape       
 despoilation, pollution &amp; traffic     
 hazards. Amenity corridors &amp; the Lea  
 Valley Park provide recreational      
 opportunities. Villages thrive but    
 assume dormitory functions.           </content>
