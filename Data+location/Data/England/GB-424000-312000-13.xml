		<title>13Facilities in Lullington</title>
		<content>   Due to its remoteness Lullington    
 offers very few facilities. There is a
 post office, public house, a village  
 hall &amp; All Saints Church.             
   The village hall was once a school  
 but due to a fall in numbers junior   
 school children now travel to Coton-in
 -the-Elms 2.3 km away.                
   Milk deliveries are made every other
 day &amp; the absence of a bus service    
 means a car is essential. Weekly      
 shopping is done at Burton or         
 Swadlincote although the post office  
 does sell basic provisions.           
   Recreation facilities are more      
 suited to older residents &amp; include a 
 cricket club, bowling green (behind   
 the Colvile Arms) &amp; the White Heather 
 Club held in the village hall.For the 
 younger generation entertainment &amp;    
 other sports facilities are found only
 by travelling to nearby towns.        </content>
