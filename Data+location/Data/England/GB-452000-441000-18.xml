		<title>18APPLETON ROEBUCK CHURCHES</title>
		<content> There are two church buildings:All    
 Saints' C.E. and a Methodist Chapel.  
 Both are in full use although they    
 have small but growing congregations. 
 Neither has a full time minister.At   
 some Festivals there are quite large  
 gatherings.The school uses All Saints 
 for its well attended Carols and      
 Harvest Festival service.             
 On the whole church going is not a    
 feature of village life for most      
 residents and the church is not at the
 centre of village activities.Neither  
 has a large hall,both use the school, 
 Parish room or the Theatre at Nun     
 Appletonfor large meetings.           
 There is a joint Sunday school in the 
 Methodist Chapel.There are Family     
 Services,joint services nd each month 
 there is a Parade service for the     
 Cubs,Brownies,Scouts &amp; Guides.        
 All Saints has a growing choir.       </content>
