		<title>13LAND USE AND FARMS-WENTHILLS</title>
		<content>     By far the greater part of the    
 land within the area surveyed belongs 
 to the Stapleton Park estate. Two     
 other farms are given as examples.    
    Castle Farm was built in Regency   
 Gothic style. It was the shooting     
 estate for Stapleton Hall. The stone  
 used came from Brockadale,and is the  
 same stone as that used for the Houses
 of Parliament.The top land is         
 limestone and the lower land is clay  
 and peat. It is very good arable land 
 after drainage.                       
    Rectory Farm, Wentbridge has 178   
 acres and is worked by three members  
 of the family. No livestock is kept.  
 The crops grown are wheat, barley and 
 sugarbeet.                            
    This emphasis on crops rather than 
 livestock is typical of the area.     
    Quite a large amount of land is    
 given over to mixed plantations.      </content>
