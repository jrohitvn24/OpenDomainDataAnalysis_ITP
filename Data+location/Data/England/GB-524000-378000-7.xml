		<content>  The lowest tier of Local Government  
 is the Parish Council.                
{ Scamblesby}Parish Council has seven  
 Councillors and meets approximately   
 six to eight times per year.          
{ Goulceby}has a joint Council with    
{Asterby.                              
                                       
  The Parish Council has many          
 wide-ranging powers,but very few      
 statutary duties.Its main functions   
 are to discuss,and perhaps resolve,   
 local issues;comment on planning      
 applications,and to express the views 
 of the Parish on the plans and        
 policies of other public agencies     
 which affect the area(e.g. schools).  
                                       
 Representatives to all the Local      
 Councils are elected every four years.
