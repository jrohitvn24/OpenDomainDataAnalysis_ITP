		<title>14PORTSDOWN HILL FORTS</title>
		<content> On the hill above Portchester is Fort 
 Nelson one of six forts on Portsdown  
 Hill known as Palmerston's Follies.   
 They were built in 1860 by Lord       
 Palmerston who was Prime Minister to  
 stop France invading Portsmouth but   
 like most deterents they were never   
 used.  Now they are used as history   
 museums.                              
 Fort Nelson is the only fort without  
 an outer moat wall because the chalk  
 sides are cut out vertically.  The    
 actual construction was completed by  
 unemployed Dockyard Carpenters and    
 Railway Navies.                       
 The main magazine was constructed     
 under the parade ground with tunnels  
 leading to below ground mortar        
 batteries.  The keep at the rear of   
 the fort protects the gate.  The line 
 of forts is invisible from the north  
 side where attack was expected.       </content>
