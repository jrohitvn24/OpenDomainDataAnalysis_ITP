		<title>08OLD PEOPLE IN BUCKHURST HILL</title>
		<content>  There are 4 old peoples homes in this
 block.The block is suitable for old   
 people because it is not far from     
 Epping Forest and doctors are helpful.
 Also there are groups of people       
 willing to visit,such as  girl        
 guides and girls from Bancrofts       
 School.                               
 We went to vist an old people's home. 
 This had 11 ladies with 16 staff      
 looking after them. Council homes can 
 have up to 60 people staying in them. 
 At the home we went to vist most of   
 the old ladies were from Buckhurst    
 Hill.They would stay at the home for  
 an average of 4-5 years.Most of them  
 are happy living there.Most of the day
 is spent sat in the lounge. The       
 highlights of the day are mealtimes   
 and the occasional visitor.Only 4 of  
 the ladies ever go out at.Their bigest
 problem is deafnes and lost memory.   </content>
