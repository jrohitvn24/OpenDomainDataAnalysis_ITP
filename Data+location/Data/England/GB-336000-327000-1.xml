		<content> Queens Head straight mile is a Roman  
 road where some excavation has taken  
 place.   The road leads to Rednal     
 aerodrome used in the 1939 - 45 war   
 used for industry.   Here there are   
 seven small factories.   The most     
 controversial being a maggot factory. 
 Lower Hadley and Wordsley are small   
 hamlets with no new building          
 permission.   All the above are in the
 electoral division of West Felton and 
 children attend West Felton Primary   
 School.   Decoy Farm is approached    
 over an unmanned crossing on the main 
 Wolverhampton/Chester railway line and
 is in the Whittington electoral       
 division.   Children attend           
 Whittington C.E. aided school.   Land 
 is used for grazing and cultivation   
 except Bagley Marsh and moor which are
 wet lands interesting to botanists.
