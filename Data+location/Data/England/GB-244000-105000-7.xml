		<title>07PUBLIC HALL &amp; PLAYING FIELD</title>
		<content> The Public Hall was built in 1930 and 
 extended in 1980 by voluntary labour. 
 Members of the Coham-Fleming family   
 laid both foundation stones. Inside   
 there is a main dance hall with a     
 stage, a dressing room and a kitchen. 
 The hall is used for dances, plays and
 badminton, and the kitchen for table  
 tennis, meetings and as a bar and tea 
 room.                                 
 Adjacent to the hall is the playing   
 field.There are two gates,an asphalted
 children's playground with swings,    
 see-saw, sand pit and roundabout, and 
 3 acres of mown grass. There is a     
 toilet and bus shelter. The grassed   
 area is used for cricket, football and
 as a general public amenity. The      
 school is opposite and uses it for    
 games lessons. The field is owned by  
 the Parish Council and mown by the    
 young people of the village.          </content>
