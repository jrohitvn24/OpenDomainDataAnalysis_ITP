		<content>{-Winmarleigh Playgroup-  }            
 This pre-school playgroup meets thrice
 weekly in the morning in the Village  
 Hall.It has been in existence only    
 some 2 years and seldom has had many  
 more than a dozen on roll.            
 However it was started to meet a need 
 in the community and is a valuable    
 link and asset in education in the    
 village.                              
{-Winmarleigh Women's Institute-}      
 Meeting monthly in the Village Hall   
 the W.I.,although not as large as its 
 neighbours,has a varied programme of  
 events and provides a vital meeting   
 shop for the ladies of the rural area.
{-The Field Day Committee-}            
 The Field Day is dealt with at length 
 below and suffice it to say that the  
 event is organised weeks and months   
 before the day by this hard-working   
 committee.                            </content>
