		<content> the Woodland Trust bought Pepper Wood 
 in 1981. It cost Â£50000.New paths were
 cleared in 1982 to create a circular  
 walk. Some volunteers helped to make a
 small pond. In Medieval times people  
 dug ditches to keep animals out of    
 Pepper Wood; you can still see part of
 the bank and ditch today. Coppicing   
 and thinning work which volunteers are
 carrying out creates a large supply of
 wood. This is being converted into    
 useful products which are being sold  
 for use in the local                  
 community.Products include bean poles,
 tree stakes, fence posts, rustic      
 fencing, hedging stakes, clothes line 
 props, tent pegs, besoms and fire     
 wood.
