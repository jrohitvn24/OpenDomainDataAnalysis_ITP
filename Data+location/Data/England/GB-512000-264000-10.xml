		<content>    During the Summer Term we have the 
 opportuniy to take part in lots of    
 extra activities. Apart from cricket, 
 rounders and Danish Longball, the     
 older children can play Short Tennis. 
 We swim in our own heated pool, have a
 Gala and practise athletics for our   
 Sports Day near the end of term.      
    The Fourth Years go to Derbyshire  
 for a week's camping at the County's  
 farm site....the first time some will 
 have been away from home without their
 parents !                             
    The last event of the term is      
 our P.T.A. Summer Concert.  This is   
 always a special family occasion when 
 parents, children and staff make music
 together. Some of us perform dances   
 and, this year, we listened to the    
 First Performance of a Rhapsody for   
 'Cello and Piano. The final item is   
 our specially composed 'School Song'. </content>
