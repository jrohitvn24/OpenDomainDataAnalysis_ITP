		<title>09LONG ASHTON RIFLE RANGE</title>
		<content> Through the village of Long Ashton,   
 past the garage, lies a quarry. This  
 is now used as a rifle range. This    
 range is one of twenty-two clubs      
 spread over England and Wales. Some of
 the rifles used are air rifles and .22
 bore rifles. The targets are set at   
 distances of 25 yards, 50 yards, 50   
 metres and 100 yards. These distances 
 are measured exactly for safety       
 reasons so the club can use the       
 natural quarry wall. The competitions 
 held on this ground are the Bristol   
 and District Open, the Avon County    
 Open and the Somerset Open and Closed.
 In an Open competition, anyone can    
 take part, but only club members are  
 allowed in a Closed event. One member 
 of this club has a specially made     
 rifle which cost him Â£1000, but most  
 people pay around Â£250. Club members  
 number between 15 and 50 people.      </content>
