		<title>05THE CHURCH OF TIBBERTON 2</title>
		<content>{EVENTS}-There is 1 service a week,held
 on a Sunday-Holy Communion with hymns 
 or Morning Prayer.Every 2 months,8    
 parishes meet for a Family Service.   
 There used to be a Sunday School but  
 it only lasted for a year as Droitwich
 Rugby Club opened and the children    
 joined.The vicar feels that there are 
 not enough children.Many of them go to
 discos or the Young Farmers Club.     
                                       
{ATTENDANCE}-The congregation number   
 has stayed the same over the years,   
 with a congregation of about 20. The  
 majority are aged 45 to 50 and all of 
 them come from Tibberton.The church is
 never locked.So far it has not        
 suffered vandalism.The vicar tells    
 us that the church is the centre of   
 the village-it helps people to find   
 God.
