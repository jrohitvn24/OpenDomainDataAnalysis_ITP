		<title>18Military Steyning</title>
		<content> On the Steyning Downs the R.A.F       
 practise their flying because it is a 
 hard place to fly around.They fly low 
 so it is easy to see them.There is    
 also a rifle range on the Downs where 
 the Army practise their shooting.     
 Normal citizens can practise          
 shooting as well if they have free    
 time.There was a plane crash during   
 the war and the plane was full of     
 German soldiers and one of them was   
 very highly ranked.The Vicar wanted   
 them to be buried in Steyning Church  
 grounds but no-one else did. In the   
 end they were buried there. There was 
 only one bomb dropped over Steyning   
 during the second world war. There was
 an army base near Steyning.At Wiston  
 pond there is a German petrol tank of 
 a plane.There are lots of airraid     
 shelters like the one at Mouse Lane.
