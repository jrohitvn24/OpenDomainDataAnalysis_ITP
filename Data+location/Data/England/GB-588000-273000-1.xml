		<content>Honington is a small village lying     
North-West of Bury St. Edmunds in      
Suffolk. The A 1088, linking Stowmarket
with Thetford, runs through the        
village. A difficult corner where a    
barn projects into the road has caused 
some traffic problems, and recently a  
40mph limit. Villagers would prefer the
route not to be signed from the A 45,  
sending major route traffic on a safer 
route via Bury.                        
      The village lies in the valley   
of the Black Bourn, a small river      
which runs North to join the Little    
Ouse, but in the village served a      
water mill, now derelict.              
     It is historically a farming      
community, but now serves more often   
as a dormitory village for workers in  
Bury and surrounding districts, as     
well as some personnel for the RAF     
Station.                               </content>
