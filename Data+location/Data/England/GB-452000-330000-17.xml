		<title>17CUSTOMS-GOTHAM TALES</title>
		<content>   Another tale is the story about the 
 cheeses.The tale begins when a man    
 from Gotham was riding home for his   
 dinner when he saw a large yellow     
 cheese which had fallen off a cart    
 which had been on the way to market.He
 was so hungry that he decided to ride 
 to Gotham to the swordsmith to get a  
 longer sword than his own in order to 
 reach the cheese.Although the sword   
 was longer it still didn't reach the  
 cheese.                               
   Just then another man came who was  
 very hungry.He asked the first man why
 he didn't get off his horse to pick up
 the cheese.As he spoke,he dismounted, 
 picked up the cheese and rode off.    
 "What a good idea,"thought the first  
 man as the other man rode off with the
 cheese.
