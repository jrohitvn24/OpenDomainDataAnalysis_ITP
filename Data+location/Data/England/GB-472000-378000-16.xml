		<title>16ALMSHOUSES OF GROVE.</title>
		<content> At the rear of the West End of the    
 Church are two Alms Houses,now in     
 an advanced stage of disrepair.They   
 were established for the village poor 
 before 1685,when Sir Creswell bought  
 the Grove Estate.He gave a Lent Gift  
 of Â£10-8s-0d for the maintainance of  
 two people in the Almshouses.This     
 Charity was eventually lost until the 
 Harcourt Vernons' restored it.The     
 Levinz Trust still remains.Until      
 recently,two spinsters-Misses Jones   
 and Steel- lived in the cottages.     
 Since their deaths,the cottages have  
 remained empty.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
