		<content> The area abounds in old farmsteads    
 nestling in the hillsides. Tradition- 
 ally the barn is a continuation of the
 farmhouse and has a single large      
 arched door, and ventilation slits    
 (reminiscient of castle arrow slits)  
 instead of windows. There is an inter-
 esting old cruck barn in Millhouse,   
 though this has fallen into disrepair.
 There are many old houses, especially 
 in Thurlstone which retains some old  
 weavers cottages. Some victorian      
 terraced housing lines the main road, 
 and both Thurlstone and Millhouse     
 Primary Schools were built by         
 Thurlstone School Board in the later  
 half of the 19th century. There are a 
 few larger victorian houses in the    
 villages. West of Millhouse are       
 Hazelhead Hall and Bullhouse Hall and 
 Chapel (see History).
