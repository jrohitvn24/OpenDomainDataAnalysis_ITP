		<title>12JUNIOR SCHOOL BOY</title>
		<content> I was born in Ireland,I live in a     
 house in Luton and go to{school}in St.
 Albans.I am eight years old.Every day 
 except the weekend I get ready for    
 school.Before the time to enter school
 we usually play football.Then I       
 changed my shoes,put my lunch box in a
 box to be taken to the dining         
 room.Then we had hymn practice.We were
 talking about two saints, John Fisher 
 was one and I forget the other one.   
 Then we went in to the classroom and  
 did our spelling, then we started our 
 diaries. I wrote three quarters of a  
 page it was playtime.After playtime I 
 did Nuffield Maths page 92. My Dad    
 teaches in St.Albans  and we have to  
{travel}in very busy traffic every     
 day.If we get held up,or the car      
 breaks down we are late. My name is   
 Cormac Scanlon.My school St.Adrians.
