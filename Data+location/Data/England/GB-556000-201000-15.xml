		<content>   Until 1982 a public house was on the
 site called the Three Horseshoes.When 
 it changed to a restaurant the owner  
 decided to call it The Shoes because  
 the local people had abreviated the   
 name of the pub to 'the shoes'. The   
 owner has also started to collect     
 ornamental shoes and has over forty.  
 The restaurant opens at 7.30pm every  
 evening and also for Sunday           
 lunches.There is seating for forty    
 downstairs and twenty upstairs.The    
 menu is very FRench with dishes such  
 as 'Mushrooms a le Grecque' and       
 'Sirlon au Rognons'.Although the      
 patrons come from a wide area,the     
 employees are mainly local.The        
 building is over 300 years old and is 
 a grade 2 listed building.Recently the
 ghost of a man who died there wassaid 
 to have been seen upstairs
