		<title>03CRAG BANK COMMUNITY PROJECT</title>
		<content>    In 1983/84 Crag Bank, an outskirt  
 of Carnforth,decided it needed a new  
 hall, the existing hall was getting   
 beyond repair. The Village Hall       
 committee led by{Cllr H. Buxton}      
 applied for numerous grants from the  
 local authorities,sports councils and 
 charities. With this money the M.P.S. 
 agreed to build the hall.      Work   
 took 14 months and ended in the spring
 of 1985.Many materials were donated or
 bought cheaply. With the M.P.S. labour
 this produced a 26m. x19m. steel      
 structure clad with metal sheets. The 
 front is of red brick with hard wood  
 windows. It cost Â£31,500 to build and 
 is worth Â£100,000. It is used for all 
 village activites such as the W.I.,   
 discos, guides and various meetings   
 and functions. The large hall will    
 also be used for Badminton, Keepfit,  
 5-a-side football and indoor bowls.   </content>
