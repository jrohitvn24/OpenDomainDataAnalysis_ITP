		<title>07ASHFORD MANOR GOLF CLUB</title>
		<content>  The first golf in this area was      
 played on Staines Moor.Eight local men
 bought the farm in Ashford and turned 
 it into a Golf Club in 1898.          
  The club will always be a golf club  
 because they went to the court to make
 sure.                                 
  There are 18 holes and in a round you
 walk about 5 miles or more depending  
 on how good a golfer you are!         
  The ground is on gravel so they have 
 to bring in extra soil.The clubhouse  
 is pretty large and very comfortable. 
  They have 8 people to look after the 
 fairways and greens,one of these      
 green_keepers is a lady.              
  The Staines By Pass runs along one   
 side of the golf course.
