		<title>01WADWORTH CHURCH</title>
		<content> Our church is 850 years old and made  
 from local limestone. You can see     
 the church from miles away and at     
 night the tower is flood lit. The     
 vicar lives in a new vicarage, the old
 one has become an old peoples home.   
 There are services on Sunday and a    
 sunday school. The vicar also looks   
 after Loversall. At harvest time the  
 children of the school bring some food
 for those who are old age pensioners. 
 The food is taken to the old people by
 the infants in our school. Wadworth   
 church needs a lot of money to hold it
 up. They also have funerals and people
 can be buried in the church yard.     
 Every month on Sundays we have a      
 Family Service with Guides, Brownies, 
 Cubs Scouts and Venture Scouts and    
 whoever wants to come. There are three
 groups of Sunday School,4-7s,7-10s and
 10-14. Village people take the groups.</content>
