		<content> My after-school activities are laying 
 the table for tea and feeding the     
 guinea pig.I watch television for one 
 hour.I still have time to do my       
 spelling and tables for school on a   
 Thursday night. Before I go to bed    
 I read a book. A treat is being able  
 to watch television for an extra hour,
 and staying up until nine o'clock     
 and going on holiday to Spain. My mum 
 cooks our meals on the electric       
 cooker.Everybody likes her food. On   
 Sunday we have a roast dinner. My best
 part is roast beef and chicken. My    
 favourite meal is chips, beans and    
 sausages. I do not like mince, peas   
 or carrots. They are horrid. I do not 
 like apple pie much and I am not too  
 keen on custard.Pets are lovely things
 to have. I have three fish, one       
 hamster and lots of bees.
