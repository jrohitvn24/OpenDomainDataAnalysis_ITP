		<content> We get home from school and change    
 into our casual clothes, putting our  
 school clothes into the{washing       
{machine.}We go into the{kitchen}and   
 get something to eat from the{fridge. 
 We then go upstairs to do our         
 homework, while eating our snack. When
 we have finished our{homework}we go   
 into the{lounge}and watch{television, 
 and on it there could be chat shows,  
 comedy or soap operas. Most people    
 have tea at 17.30. We normally have a 
 two course meal(savoury, then sweet). 
 After tea we may get tired so we will 
 have a hot{bath,}put on our           
 nightclothes and go to bed. In the    
 morning we get up and get ready for   
 school, then have{breakfast}of cereals
 or toast. Sometimes we watch breakfast
 television. During weekends and       
 holidays we can stay in bed later.When
 we get up we can watch children's t.v.</content>
