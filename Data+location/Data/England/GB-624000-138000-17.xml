		<title>17WEST HOUGHAM</title>
		<content>   There are two Houghams _ Church     
 Hougham and West Hougham.They are     
 separated from each other by about    
 half a mile of fields.                
   West Hougham is the larger and      
 possesses a Post Office and General   
 Stores and a recently re_opened public
 house,the Chequers,which is built in  
 typical Kentish weatherboarding.      
   Today few people who live in the    
 village actually work in it,most have 
 jobs in either Folkestone or Dover    
 often connected with the Channel      
 Ports.                                
   Each Spring Bank Holiday Monday,    
 West Hougham holds a fete with stalls,
 games,refreshments and a display of   
 country dancing by the children of    
 Capel School.                         
   In 1665 Londoners brought the Plague
 to Hougham,900 people died and are    
 buried in "The Graves" Abbott's Cliff.</content>
