{Yew Tree Farm.}It covers 220 acres,   
 75 acres of which are grass grown for 
{silage.}This is used for cattle feed  
 after it has stood for 6 weeks. Each  
 cow requires between 6-8 tons each    
 winter. The farm produces 1,000 tons a
 year.                                 
 The herd of{cows}is 80 strong with one
 Limousin bull called Tarquin, who cost
 1,600 guineas. There are 85 younger   
 cows called 'followers' and 170       
 calves. Limousin/Fresian cross calves 
 are fed on milk, rearing pellets,     
 rolled oats, hay and straw and are    
 bred for{beef.                        
 Cows are milked in a{milking parlour,}
 six at a time. Coloured tapes on their
 tails show how much feed they require.
 The milk which is thermostatically    
 cooled, flows into a 1700 litre tank
