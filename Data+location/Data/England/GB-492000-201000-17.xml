		<content> We have one main theatre in Chesham,  
Elgiva Hall, which has events ranging  
from  extravagant roller-discos and    
displays, to theatrical amusements and 
plays.In the foyer there are several   
seats and a bar where you can buy a    
meal and a drink in the day.It is      
equipped with 2 changing rooms and a   
ticket checkout.It is very popular     
throughout Chesham and seats roughly   
300 people in the main hall.It also has
a big orchestra pit where bands play.It
has a wide variety of curtains and     
different groups work at the scenery   
and put on shows.Sometimes there is a  
display of cars and they are driven    
into the hall.The seats can be taken up
and the stage can be enlarged.There are
different types of shows put on such as
music or even recent films.
