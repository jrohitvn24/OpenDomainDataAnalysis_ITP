   Police Constable Daykin is our local
 policeman, he works in the villages of
 Willington, Repton and Findern. He    
 travels around the villages on        
 foot,his bicycle or sometimes in his  
 car.                                  
   To keep in contact with the police  
 station he uses a two-way radio or    
 public telephone.His working week can 
 be anything between 34 and 64 hours   
 per week.During P.C.Daykins off-duty  
 periods another policeman takes care  
 of the villages.                      
   In his pocket P.C.Daykin carries    
 lots interesting and useful articles. 
 He has several identical uniforms and 
 he told us that he had arrested quite 
 alot of people during his time as a
