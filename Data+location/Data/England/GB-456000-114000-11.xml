		<title>11CHRISTIANITY IN SWANMORE</title>
		<content>{St. Barnabas' Church}is the Church of 
 England in Swanmore.  It was built in 
 1844.  Mr. Peterson, the vicar,       
 retired on Sunday 23rd June, l985.  He
 had been our Vicar for twenty-three   
 years.  Rev. Michael Welch from       
 Portsmouth has been appointed to this 
 Parish from Autumn l985.  The Church  
 has six bells.  These are made from   
 cast iron and each one is a different 
 size and has a different tone.        
{The Methodist Chapel}was built in     
 1863.  Mr. Barrat, the minister, has  
 been a minister for thirty-seven years
 and he is going to retire in August,  
 1985.  Mr. Barrat was ordained in     
 South Africa.  The Swanmore Chapel has
 no bells or tower.  We found that in  
 Swanmore Primary School most children 
 go to the Church of England, only two 
 go to the R.C. church in Bishop's     
 Waltham and 24 to the Methodist Chapel</content>
