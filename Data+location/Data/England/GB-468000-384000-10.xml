 Trumpeter Swan and the smallest is the
 Hottentot Teal but the mallards are   
 the most numerous.  The Flamingoes are
 fed a diet which includes vitamins and
 prawns to retain their colour.        
 Feeding the birds twice a day costs   
 Â£4,ooo a year but they have problems  
 in winter when large numbers of Canada
 Geese and Coots fly in.  Injured birds
 are brought to the Park and lO to l5

 8 thousand visitors each year who pay 
 Â£l.2O for entry (6Op for children and 
 old aged pensioners.  The park is open
 every day, except Christmas, from lO  
 a.m. to 6.p.m. (9 p.m. Thursdays).
