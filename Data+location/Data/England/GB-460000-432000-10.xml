		<title>10THE NEW FLAXLEY ESTATE</title>
		<content>  The new estate is open plan in design
 with the houses constructed of red    
 brick with tiled roofs.There are a    
 variety of street plans ranging from  
 crescents to very complicated curves  
 and twists of the roads with many     
 paths and snickets joining each block.
  Some of the houses are privately     
 owned and some are council owned.Our  
 back gardens are fenced off and       
 private, although they are quite      
 small.The coal bunker is just outside 
 the back door.Some people have built  
 greenhouses and sheds and a few grow  
 vegetables.                           
  On some of the side streets away from
 the main roads young children play in 
 the road on tricycles,bicycles and toy
 cars.Cars have to drive through very  
 carefully.There is a small park were  
 older children can play.
