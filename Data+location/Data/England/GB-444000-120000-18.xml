		<title>18BIRTH OF CRESTWOOD SCHOOL</title>
		<content> "WELCOME TO THE TODAY COMMUNITY!"     
 The billboard sign encourages the     
 driver to bring the family            
 Or business and explore the potential 
 of Boyatt Wood.                       
 The leafy woodland path has now become
 the Tarmaced Woodside Avenue          
 Which curves its way round where a red
 stadium has risen from                
 The ever-shifting woodland floor;     
 Crescent-shaped,in the midst of such  
 historic woodland,                    
 The name was decided upon -CRESTWOOD- 
 and the new school was founded.       
 The caterpillar tracks of the heavy   
 machinery chug and squelch,           
 Struggling to find a hold in the      
 bubbling quicksand.                   
 Reservoirs of mud congeal and flatten,
 Awaiting the Tarmac and paving stones.
 Impatient pigeons and storm-struck sea
 -gulls glide in ever-widening circles,</content>
