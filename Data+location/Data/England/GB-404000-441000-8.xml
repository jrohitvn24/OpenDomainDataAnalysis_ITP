		<title>08KEIGHLEY MOSQUE</title>
		<content>    The Mosque was built on Emily      
 Street so that the Muslims could have 
 somewhere to worship, it will be 10   
 years old in September 1985.  Between 
 30 and 70 people pray there each day, 
 the special day is Friday.   Muslim's 
 God is Allah and Mohammed is his      
 Prophet. They believe that reading the
 Quran helps them to lead a perfect    
 life.  As you enter the Mosque you    
 must take off your shoes, cover       
 your head and wash your hands, feet   
 and face to show respect the House of 
 Allah.                                
    The Mosque is different to our     
 Church because it does not have seats,
 but a carpet, it has no organ and no  
 eagle.The roof has a lot of decoration
 The Mosque does not do weddings like  
 the Church.
