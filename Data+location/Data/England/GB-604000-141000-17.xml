		<title>17MERSHAM HATCH ESTATE  3</title>
		<content>The livestock consists of 450 Friesian 
dairy cows and 400 followers. Milk is  
the largest source of income.At Birch- 
holt Court we saw the computerised     
milking parlour where 12 cows are milk-
ed by machine at one time. This happens
twice a day. Each cow has a number,and 
this is fed into the computer so food  
is allocated. In Summer 12 litres of   
milk must be produced off grass before 
there is any extra food.After that it  
is 25grams of cattle cake per litre.   
It takes 7minutes to milk one cow, and 
about 2hours to milk the 120cows in    
this dairy.These cows are yielding 5250
litres a year,and the herd is producing
about 8000litres a day.                
Science has eliminated the most serious
diseases such as T.B.and brucellosis,  
and the warble fly has been eradicated 
as a result of thorough control.
