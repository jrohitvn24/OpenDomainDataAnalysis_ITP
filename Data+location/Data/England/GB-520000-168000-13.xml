		<title>13RACAL MARINE</title>
		<content>  {Racal Marine}is a member of the     
 Racal Group which deals in elect-     
 ronics. The factory we visited        
 produced marine radar equipment for   
 commercial use.                       
   We first visited the 'goods inwards'
 department where all the component    
 parts arrive at the factory and are   
 logged into a filing system. These    
 parts are then tested to check that   
 they are not faulty. The largest part 
 of the factory is the production de-  
 partment where the radars are         
 assembled.The marine radars are not   
 mass-produced but made in batches.    
   The factory employs about 600 people
 on site,including people on the Youth 
 Training Scheme and the Disabled.     
   The hours of work are 8am to 4.30pm 
 with overtime until 6.30pm.They have a
 10 minute break halfway through the   
 morning with half-an-hour for lunch.  </content>
