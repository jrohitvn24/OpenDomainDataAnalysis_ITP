		<content>ORIGINALLY THE NAME FOR THIS BODY WAS, 
NEIGHBOURHOOD  WATCH.EACH YEAR BETWEEN 
18 TO 19 CRIMES ARE COMMITTED, THESE   
ARE MAINLY  BURGLARIES. THE IDEA OF THE
COMMUNITY CRIME WATCH IS  TO ENCOURAGE 
PEOPLE TO TELL THE POLICE WHAT THEY SEE
AND HEAR AS THEY GO ON WITH THEIR DAILY
LIVES.EACH STREET HAS A CONTACT AND    
THE INHABITANTS OF THAT STREET KNOW WHO
THEIR CONTACT IS.THE ORGANISATION HAS  
BEEN IN EXISTENCE SINCE 15TH           
JUNE 1985. ALL OF BOZEAT'S POLICE      
CONSTABLES LIVE IN WELLINGBOROUGH,     
WOLLASTON OR NORTHAMPON.THERE ARE TWO  
THINGS WHICH POLICE ALWAYS REMEMBER,   
CRIME PREVENTION AND CRIME DETECTION.  
THE LOCAL POLICEMAN VISITS THE SCHOOL  
REGULARLY TO TALK ON ROAD SAFETY.HE    
ALSO HELPS AND TESTS CHILDREN FOR      
CYCLING PROFICIENCY.
