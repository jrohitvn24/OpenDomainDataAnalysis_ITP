		<title>07A Village Family</title>
		<content>The Lindars family have lived in       
Tetsworth for more than 300 years. We  
spoke to Mr.Lindars who has lived in   
the village for all his 82 years.He was
one of twelve children, but such large 
families were not uncommon in his day. 
(The largest village family today has  
six children.)Mr.Lindars used to live  
in two cottages, one is now the Art    
Gallery but the other was pulled down. 
He estimated that a dozen or so        
cottages have been demolished in       
the last few years. He used to travel  
as far as Reading by horse, but usually
walked everywhere. His father kept an  
allotment and chickens to supplement   
his farm worker's wage. Mr. Lindars    
went to our school and told us how the 
teachers used a wheelbarrow to get the 
children out of school when it flooded.
He left school at 11 and went to work  
on a farm and later at the car factory.</content>
