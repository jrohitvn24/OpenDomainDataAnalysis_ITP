		<title>11Education in Bawdeswell</title>
		<content> As there is no provision for nursery  
 education in the State system, 22     
 children aged 3 to 5 attend the       
 voluntarily run Bawdeswell playgroup. 
 This is run by a supervisor, Corrine  
 France, and an assistant, Wendy       
 Riches, who are employed by a         
 committee comprised of the childrens' 
 mothers. The playgroup is a member of 
 the Pre-School Playgroups Association 
 which gives advice and assistance     
 where required as well as organising  
 meetings and events.                  
 50 children of ages 5 to 11 go to the 
 village Primary School. Older         
 children, 11 to 16, are transported by
 coach to Reepham High School. Sixth   
 form education is at Fakenham, Norwich
 or Wymondham and the children travel  
 by public transport or private car.
