		<content>{INTER-VILLAGE QUIZ.}                  
 Blyth has done well so far in the 1985
 inter-village quiz. Among fifty nine  
 Nottinghamshire villages Blyth won    
 their round answering questions on    
 sport,music,general knowledge,politics
 and television.                       
{BEST KEPT VILLAGE.}                   
 The inhabitants of Blyth are working  
 hard hoping for success in the best   
 kept village competition,in section B,
 700-2,000 population.                 
{SCOUTS,CUBS,GUIDES,BROWNIES.}         
 Blyth cubs came fourth out of fourteen
 teams in a recent general knowledge   
 quiz. There is a cubs fun camp in     
 July, at Walesby, with Gandey's Family
 Circus. All the cubs and scouts took  
 part in their jobwork; 75 years of    
 guiding was celebrated at'Guides Alive
 on 8th June, and some Guides have been
 on a day trip to York,recently.       </content>
