		<title>06The day of a farmer's son 3</title>
		<content> With the radio going in the tractor my
 brother and I are happy bobbing up and
 down planting the brocoli plants. It  
 is when we see our mum at the gateway 
 that it is time for our evening meal. 
 Up goes my Dad's hand signalling that 
 he has seen her and that he is hungry 
 and willing to eat. This meal         
 generally consists of some kind of    
 roast or a hot dish. We quickly eat it
 up and are usually sitting down until 
 roughly 6.45 after the main news has  
 ended. And by 7.00 pm I am out in the 
 brocoli field again raring to get     
 started once more. With my Dad driving
 I need to plant the brocoli a little  
 quicker than with my brother and I am 
 often told to plant a little quicker  
 by my brother. In this case most of my
 rows were the worst of the two rows   
 and I hear shouts of:"What are you    
 like boy" from Dad.                   </content>
