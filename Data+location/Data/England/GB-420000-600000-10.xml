		<title>10The Railway at Acklington</title>
		<content>{Acklington Station}is no longer the   
 thriving station it once was. The line
 is busy with High Speed 125 trains    
 running between London and Edinburgh, 
 but only 6 trains stop each day at our
 station (3 going north, 3 going south)
 and few people get on or off. Perhaps 
 the occasional visitor for the prison,
 or the inmate on his release day, or a
 family going shopping to Newcastle,   
 but certainly not the numbers using   
 the trains as there used to be. The   
 old station itself, which was falling 
 into disrepair, has been privately    
 bought and is now a dwelling house.   
{The Railway Inn,}owned by Scottish &amp;  
 Newcastle Breweries, is open 7 days a 
 week from 11 a.m.-3 p.m. and 7-11 p.m.
 Two people work there, the busiest    
 days are Tuesdays &amp; Thursdays (mart   
 days) and the most popular drinks are 
 lager, scotch (whisky) and rum.       </content>
