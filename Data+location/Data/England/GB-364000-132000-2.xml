and Coombe House.Sexey's is a mixed    
school,with about 250 pupils in the    
first five year-groups and 160 students
in the Sixth Form.Junior House is only 
for the First Years and after a year   
you go to one of the other houses.     
    Sexey's School was founded in 1889,
it was started by the money left from  
the old endowments of Sexey's Hospital.
The money was given to Sexey's Hospital
by a man called Hugh Sexey,who lived in
the sixteenth century.When the school  
started in 1889 it was a boys' day     
grammar school.Now it is a mixed       
boarding,comprehensive school.
