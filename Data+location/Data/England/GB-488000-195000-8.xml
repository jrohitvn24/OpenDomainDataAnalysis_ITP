		<title>08H.GREEN &amp; HAZLEMERE'S GHOSTS</title>
		<content>A ghost story in Holmer Green states   
that every Thursday at midnight        
a carriage from the 17th century rides 
into the village pond.The only         
explanation known is that during the   
17th century a rich and powerful       
family drove into Holmer Green their   
horse bucked and the carriage went     
flying into the pond.In the middle     
of the pond it is quick sand and the   
whole family drowned.                  
        In Hazlemere late one evening  
Mr.Farmborough and his friends were    
walking down Primrose Hill when they   
saw a procession of white objects go   
across the road straight in front of   
them .These objects were about a foot  
off the ground and about 3 and a half  
feet high.They looked around and       
nothing was there so they ran as fast  
as they could.                         
                                       </content>
