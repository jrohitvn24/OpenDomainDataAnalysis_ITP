		<title>10THE MOAT FIELD IN SHAWBURY</title>
		<content>   The{Moat}is an area of low-lying    
 land next to the{River Roden}in the   
 village of Shawbury.                  
   In the Middle Ages it was a deep    
 ditch filled with water surrounding a 
{manor house}-long since disappeared.  
   Now the ditch is empty because it   
 was drained, and overgrown,although   
 children before the{1939-45 war}used  
 to skate there on the ice in winter.  
{  Daffodils}were planted to decorate  
 the{Church}at{Easter}and this is still
 done.A vicar used to{bathe}in the pond
 which is alongside the river.         
   There are many{trees,}mainly very   
 old oaks.Owls and pigeons nest there, 
 rabbits have burrows and foxes are    
 heard at night.                       
   The Moat is about to become a{park. 
 There will be benches and people will 
 be able to walk and play there.
