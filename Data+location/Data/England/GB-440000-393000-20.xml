		<content> Bulldog                               
 Bulldog is a game where you find      
 a person to be "on" who stands in the 
 middle and shouts Bulldog. All the    
 other people run to the other side of 
 the playing area and the person in the
 middle tries to catch them. If he does
 he shouts 1,2,3,Bulldog. This carries 
 on till everyone is caught.           
                                       
 Dickie Levo                           
 You pick sides and one side count to  
 100 in 5's. and chase the other side. 
 When they catch them they shout 1,2,3,
 Dickie Levo and that person is out    
 until one of his team frees him.      
                                       
 Kerby                                 
 You throw a bouncy ball at the kerb.  
 the other person has to catch it      
 before it bounces.
