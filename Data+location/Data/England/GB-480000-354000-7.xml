		<content> Good health is important to us and we 
 wash ,bathe or shower everyday to keep
 our bodies clean.All houses in        
 Winthorpe have bathrooms and inside   
 water closets.We clean our teeth to   
 prevent decay and we wash our hair    
 regularly.                            
 Children  can be immunised against    
{diseases,}such as polio and whooping  
 cough. Most get mumps ,measles and    
 chickenpox and nearly everyone suffers
 from the common cold from time to     
 time. These can be treated at home.   
 When we are ill ,we visit {doctors}in 
 Newark or Collingham. They prescribe  
 medicines which are free to children  
 through the Natianal Health Service.  
 More seriously-ill people go into     
{hospital}in Newark or Nottingham for  
 operations or special care.           
 Ambulances,carrying life-saving       
 equipment,are used for emergencies.   </content>
