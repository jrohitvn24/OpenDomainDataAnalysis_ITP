		<content>    The present school was opened in   
 1917, and remained largely unchanged  
 until the 1950's and the expansion of 
 the R.A.F. quarters.   The increased  
 population led to the addition of     
 extra classrooms in several stages, to
 accommodate the ever-increasing number
 of children on roll (from a small     
 rural school to a maximum number in   
 the mid 1970's of 465 children of     
 primary school age).                  
                                       
    At present, July 1985, there are   
 226 children on roll, taught by 9     
 teachers.   Approximately 60% of the  
 children are from R.A.F. families.    
                                       
    In addition to the normal subjects 
 in the curriculum of a typical primary
 school, the children can take part in 
 several voluntary leisure activities.
