		<title>08SHOECROFT BARN FORGE -BIBURY</title>
		<content> A small forge has been in operation   
 since 1977 in a lean-to to Shoecroft  
 Barn, Bibury. Its principal products  
 are animal feeders and tubular gates  
 and fencing for farms, as well as     
 accessories such as roofracks for     
 Landrovers made for export. In        
 addition, work on farm gates and      
 general repairs are carried out in    
 situ by the blacksmith who normally   
 works on his own. Occasionally an     
 assistant is employed to produce      
 garden gates, flower pedestals and    
 ornamental brackets of wrought iron,  
 mainly to customers' own design. The  
 forge provides a service which is     
 mainly local, but orders are taken for
 example for machine guards for        
 factories outside the area.
