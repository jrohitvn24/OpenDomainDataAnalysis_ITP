		<content> There are many legends of ghosts, but 
 only a few have been seen in recent   
 years. A cleaner at Ashlyns Hall has  
 seen the ghosts of an old man, once in
 the basement, and once sitting, in    
 what is at present an upstairs office.
 Legend also has it that a ghostlt lady
 walks across the balcony at the front 
 of Ashlyns Hall. A security guard was 
 patroling the outside of the house,   
 when suddenly his dog stood with his  
 hair on end, and refused to walk past 
 the balcony. Several people were      
 walking near Grove Farm, when a lady  
 in white floated across thier path,   
 then disappeared. In a meadow in Two  
 Dell's Lane one midsummers evening, a 
 man in grey was seen to step up the   
 bank, then disappear.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
