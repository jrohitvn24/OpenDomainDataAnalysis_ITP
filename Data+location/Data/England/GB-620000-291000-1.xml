 of the village of{LONG STRATTON}(pop. 
 2000) and consists of an attractive{  
{RURAL}landscape,{undulating}between   
 41m and 54m above sea-level. One small
 stream flows north-south draining to  
 the R.Yare system.{FARMING}dominates  
 the area and whilst many{fields}have  
 been recently been enlarged, many old 
{hedges}remain intact, which together  
 with numerous{coppices}and{deciciduous
{woods}provide a habitat for wild birds
 and small animals.{COMMON LAND}with a 
 large variety of wild flowers and     
 areas of pond and marsh is to be found
 most extensively in{FRITTON}and also  
 in Morningthorpe, Shelton and Wood    
 Green. The parishes are linked by     
{minor roads,}supplemented by{farm     
{tracks}and{footpaths.}The busy A140   
 trunk road linking Norwich to Ipswich,
 cuts the North-West corner.           </content>
