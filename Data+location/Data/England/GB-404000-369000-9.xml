		<title>09FOXLOW FARM</title>
		<content> We went to interview the owners of the
 farm. They live in the new farmhouse  
 they built four and a half years ago. 
 His parents live in the old farmhouse 
 in which the remains of a medieval    
 barn can be seen. The farm used to be 
 bigger, but about 11 years ago they   
 sold some land to {Barretts}who built 
 the{Foxlow Housing Estate.}As a result
 they were able to buy the Staden      
 Grange farm land but they lost their  
 lowest and most sheltered land.       
 Therefore they decided not to keep    
 sheep any more. Now the farm is a     
 dairy and beef farm with a few pigs.  
 They have fields with hay which they  
 use to make silage. There are 2 full  
 time workers. In winter the farmer's  
 wife milks the cows each day and in   
 the summer she runs a guest house.
