		<title>20FAUNA - BIRDS &amp; BEASTS</title>
		<content> In a rural area like this, there are  
 lots of different birds and animals.  
 Among the rarer birds are a pair of   
 herons - nobody's goldfish can be     
 secure. Another fish lover is the     
 kingfisher - we have seen them hunting
 along the streams, so there must be   
 fish in the streams.  There are       
 several badger setts and foxes abound.
 We've seen an old fox lope through a  
 flock of sheep without disturbing them
 at all - yet they'll scatter and panic
 if a dog comes through.  Some birds   
 and animals are pests. Rabbits        
 have increased tremendously in recent 
 years and escaped mink have been seen.
  Magpies, rooks and pigeons all have  
 to be controlled.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
