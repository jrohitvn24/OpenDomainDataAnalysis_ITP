		<title>19CARR WOOD</title>
		<content> Carr Wood is a deciduous wood  between
 Jackson Bridge and Hepworth. A stream 
 runs through it as does a public      
 footpath. Cattle graze throughout the 
 wood and poultry are kept in the      
 Northern end. The most common trees   
 are the Sycamore and the Beech with   
 many Ash and Oak and several Silver   
 Birch and Elder. Holly, Hawthorn and  
 Wild Rose are common bushes, with     
 areas of Gorse, Bramble and Bilberry. 
 July flowers include Red and White    
 clover, Buttercup, Thistle, Purple and
 White Foxglove, White Dead Nettle,    
 Honeysuckle, Daisy, Tufted Vetch,     
 Creeping Cinquefoil and White         
 Goosegrass. Grey Squirrels, Hedgehogs 
 and Rabbits live in the wood and there
 are fishes in the stream. Other       
 wildlife includes Foxes, Stoats,      
 Weasels and occasional sightings of   
 Badgers(for bird life-page 15).       </content>
