		<content> 1.{HOUSING }Owing to the high cost of 
 property in this area most houses are 
 now too expensive for farm labourers. 
 These have now been bought by         
 townsfolk wishing to live in the      
 country.This together with the        
 reduction of tied cottages sometimes  
 causes housing problems for           
 farm-workers, some of whom nowlive in 
 nearby towns.                         
 2.{GIPSIES}The influx of gipsies at   
 harvest time caused problems such as  
 education for their children and      
 noise.These are resolving themselves  
 because with changes in farming       
 methods there is no longer such a     
 demand for them. Those gipsies who    
 remain are gradually being found      
 council housing.                      
 3.{TRAFFIC }Traffic along the         
 east-west route (A4133)can be         
 over-loaded and dangerous.            </content>
