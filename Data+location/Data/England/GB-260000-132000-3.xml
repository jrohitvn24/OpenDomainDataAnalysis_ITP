		<title>03GOODLEIGH CHURCH</title>
		<content> There could have been a church in our 
 village as far back as AD 1042 but the
 present church was rebuilt in 1881    
 because it was falling down.It was    
 dedicated to Gregory the Great.The    
 church is built of stone and so is the
 tower which is older than the rest of 
 the church.There are six bells in the 
 church tower and on Thursday nights   
 they have bell ringing practice and on
 Monday nights there are handbell      
 lessons.Goodleigh church is famous for
 campanology.The oldest grave dates    
 back to 1747.The originals of the     
 parish registers are kept at Exeter.
