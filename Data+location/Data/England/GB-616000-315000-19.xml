		<content> TRANSPORT PLAYS A BIG ROLE IN THE     
 EVERYDAY LIFE OF ALL INHABITANTS.     
 HORSFORD'S GROWTH AND SHAPE IS LARGELY
 DUE TO THE INCREASE IN OWNERSHIP OF   
 MOTOR CARS. THE B1149 IS BUSY AT MOST 
 TIMES BUT ESPECIALLY DURING THE       
 COMMUTER PERIODS; 8-9am. AND 4.30 -   
 5.30pm. ADULTS ARE THEN TRAVELLING TO 
 WORK AND CHILDREN TO SCHOOL. HORSFORD 
 CHILDREN WALK, WHILE ST. FAITHS AND   
 FELTHORPE ARE BUSED TO SCHOOL.CARS    
 ARE THE MOST COMMON FORM OF TRANSPORT,
 THOUGH MANY LORRIES CAN BE SEEN ON    
 DELIVERY JOURNEYS DURING THE DAY. THE 
 BICYCLE IS POPULAR FOR LOCAL TRANSPORT
 AND USED BY THE ENTHUSIAST FOR LONGER 
 JOURNEYS... NORWICH AND BEYOND. THE   
 MOTOR CYCLE CAN BE SEEN OFTEN, THOUGH 
 IT IS FAR LESS POPULAR. WALKERS ARE   
 EITHER LOCAL, OR RECREATIONAL.        
 RESIDENTIAL CLOSES ARE VERY QUIET     
 AND FEW VEHICLES ARE SEEN ALONG THEM. </content>
