		<title>14HEBBURN SHIPYARDS</title>
		<content> We went to Swan Hunter's{shipyards}one
 day.  12 people went and I was one of 
 them.  We questioned a man from the   
 gate.  He told us he'd worked in      
 shipyards for 40 years and seen many  
 changes.  We walked past giant cranes 
 holding massive electromagnets.  In   
 the assembly shop there were gigantic 
 rollers which roll pieces of sheet    
 metal along.  Next there was a machine
 to cut the metal and a machine to bend
 it.                                   
 One crane there was able to pick up   
 126 tons of metal.                    
 We walked on to the{dry dock.} It is  
 one of the biggest on the river.  We  
 walked back to the gate passing the   
 canteen on the way.                   
 There are now only 50 men working     
 there.  They are waiting for orders   
 for new ships.                        
                                       </content>
