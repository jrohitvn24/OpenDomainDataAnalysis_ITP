		<content>  {Farming}has always played an        
 important part in the life of the     
 community, some farms and their       
 buildings date back to the{1600's,    
 although many{buildings}have been     
 almost entirely rebuilt. Mr.Fairclough
 a local farmer, relates the changes in
 his lifetime from{mixed farming}to    
 predominantly{arable. Barley, wheat}  
 and{hay}are the major crops, although 
 in the last 5 years{rape}also has     
 become a major crop as{animal farming}
 has declined.                         
   With an average{farm size}of        
 approximately 140 acres the local     
 farms are run as a family concern     
 having a family{workforce}of 3 or 4   
 full time people.
