		<content>{Church going}is no longer universal   
 as it was 50 years ago.The reasons are
 many and varied.However,congregations 
 are as large as ever for special      
 services such as Christmas,Easter,the 
 Harvest Festival,marriages,funerals   
 and baptisms.{St.Leonard's Anglican   
{Church }is the only church still open 
 in the area.The tower was built in    
 1715 but the nave etc. was built in   
 1856 at the expense of the incumbent. 
 The most interesting internal feature 
 is the Italian stained glass in two   
 of the windows.These were stranded in 
 Paris during the 1870-71 Siege.{Church
{links with the Commmunity}are still of
 great importance and the Rector still 
 occupies an important position in     
 local society.{Church and School}links
 are also close.Although the school is 
 small the children participate fully  
 in all the important festivals.       </content>
