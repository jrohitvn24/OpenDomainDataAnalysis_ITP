		<content> Croughton has its own area of small   
 industrial units in Park End, housed  
 in old RAF buildings, or in purpose   
 built small workshop units.  There is 
 a garage with petrol pumps and        
 workshop situated on the main road,   
 with a Hire Service next door.        
 The owners of the several small       
 units within the estate have chosen   
 Croughton for its low rates and       
 running costs, but rents have risen   
 steeply.  Firms include a manufacturer
 of radios and record players, who     
 employs a number of local people; car 
 repair with car and skip hire; a      
 printer's and a shoe factory, also    
 employing a few locals.  New larger   
 warehouse units were built this year, 
 and include the showroom of Croughton 
 Antiques.  A small furniture factory  
 is located in the centre of the       
 village.                              </content>
