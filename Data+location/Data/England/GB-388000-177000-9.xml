		<content>     The school is attended by 52      
 children (as at 12/7/85), who are     
 divided into three classes.           
     Up until 1978 the school was next 
 to the Village Hall, and opposite the 
 Church and Post Office.               
     This{old school}was built in 1866,
 and{Herbert Prodgers,}who was then the
 owner of the Manor, put up most of the
 money, at a cost of Â£650.             
     In 1903 the Headmistress,{Miss    
{White,}was receiving Â£76 a year, with 
 an attendance of about 99 children.   
   {The present school,}which is at the
 end of The Ridings, was moved into on 
 Wednesday 11th.October 1978. It has   
 three classrooms, although one of     
 these is also the Hall.               
     Most of the children who attend   
 walk from within the village. Only two
 or three are brought in from          
 Chippenham or Hullavington.           </content>
