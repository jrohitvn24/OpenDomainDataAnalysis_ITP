		<title>04FARMING</title>
		<content> The farm is not big enough to have    
 full time employees,so the owner,her  
 husband,her mother father and brother 
 all have other jobs but give time to  
 the farm.In the late spring and summer
 work is not so hard as the sheep are  
 put out to grass. Even the very young 
 children can help. As the weather gets
 worse the animals allowed to come to  
 shelter and are fed hay oats and      
 mineral supplements.                  
 The hardest time is lambing because a 
 24 hour watch has to be kept.Last year
 they lost some lambs. They had been so
 overworked in the very cold conditions
 that they missed the 4a.m.shift. Four 
 sets of twins died because they were  
 so small they froze to death.Even so  
 they were able to sell 180 fat lambs  
 at market.
