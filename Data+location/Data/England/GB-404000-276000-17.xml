		<title>17RELIGION IN KINGS NORTON</title>
		<content>In Kings Norton there are four churches
.There also used to be a church on mass
House lane but this was knocked down   
approximately 7 years ago.{St Nicolas} 
is  the oldest church in Kings Norton. 
It is Church of England and it was     
built in Norman times so that it could 
serve  the village of Kings Norton.    
They built{ St.Pauls} church because of
the new housing estates and{catholics} 
who lived in them. Origanally this     
parish used to belonged to St.JosephÂ£s.
{St.JosephÂ£s} was getting large and    
through the poor bus  routes the people
who lived on the estate found it too   
far to go.Before the church was built  
we used to have mass in St.PaulÂ£s      
schoool hall. By children of St.Pauls  
Catholic J/I School.
