		<title>04PLAYGROUND GAMES, HENFIELD.</title>
		<content>   During our playtimes we find there  
 are plenty of different games to play.
 We are lucky because we have a large  
 field to play on or a very large      
 asphalt playground. Here are some     
 games.                                
          Elastics by Fiona.           
   For elastics you need 3 yards of    
 strong elastic about a centimetre     
 wide.  It should be knotted together. 
 Two people step inside the Elastic and
 and one person is the leader.  The    
 leader  does something and the next   
 person copies.  If they make a mistake
 they are out and another person takes 
 their place.  It is fun to play and   
 sometimes quite difficult.            
           Field Games                 
   In the summer we can use the field. 
 We play football and cricket.  We can 
 run freely and play leapfrog. It is   
 good fun on the field.                </content>
