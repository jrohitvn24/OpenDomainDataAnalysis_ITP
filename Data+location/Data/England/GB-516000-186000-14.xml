		<title>14LIFESTYLES IN NORTH BRENT</title>
		<content>{Kenton} is a very pleasant area with  
 a lot of open spaces. Most of the {   
{houses} are semi-detached and were    
 built in the 1930's.There are two     
 shopping areas both of which are clean
 and pleasant. The {appliances} which  
 we have in our homes add to our       
 lifestyle. We have a variety of       
 electrical appliances, including      
 washing mmachines (automatic), tumble 
 dryers, dishwashers, microwave ovens, 
 videa records and computers,          
 television and radio.  The majority of
 people have at least one car          
 sometimees more which help them with  
 their jobs. A lot of people's         
 lifestyles are  ruled by the {        
{television} but we are encouraged to  
 join clubs and to meet new people. We 
 often go to the cinema, theatre and   
 concerts.We also go on holiday every  
 year, usually abroad.                 </content>
