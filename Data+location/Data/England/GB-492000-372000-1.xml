		<content> Our area for the Domesday project is  
 mostly farm land but includes part of 
 Skellingthorpe and Burton. The land is
 mainly flat but rises slightly at     
 Burton. There are only a few houses   
 and no shops, but there are two       
 garages, a cafe and two public houses.
 Both the Fossdyke canal and the new   
 Lincoln bypass go through the area.   
 Near Burton there are some gravel pits
 which are now a nature reserve. There 
 is a sewerage works and pumping       
 station at Skellingthorpe and not far 
 away from there is a slaughter house. 
 Lincoln race course is also partly    
 within our area.
