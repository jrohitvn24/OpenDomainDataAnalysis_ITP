		<title>06Work in Tiptoe.</title>
		<content> Mr and Mrs Gulliver are a retired     
 couple. Mrs Gulliver has lived in     
 Tiptoe since 1938. They spend their   
 day doing housework and gardening.    
 They find a car essential to make     
 shopping trips and visit friends and  
 relatives since the bus service is    
 poor and there is now only one shop in
 Tiptoe. From an employment survey of  
 parents we discovered that only 3     
 parents live and work in Tiptoe. Mrs  
 D. Gold and Mrs M. Gold both work as  
 playgroup supervisors. The ladies work
 12 hours a week and enjoy their job.  
 They have worked there 7 years and 6  
 years respectively. Mrs Coleman has   
 been working in Tiptoe school kitchen 
 for 3 years. She enjoys her work and  
 likes working with the other ladies.
