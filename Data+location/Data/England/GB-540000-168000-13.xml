		<title>13Ravensbourne College of Art.</title>
		<content>The College,which moved from Bromley   
Common in May 1975,to Waldon Road,is   
purpose built.It is set in lovely      
grounds, once part of Waldon Manor.The 
college seems tucked out of the way but
is accessible from all areas and is    
near a main line station.              
 There are courses in Three-Dimensional
Design,Fashion,Graphics,Film and T.V.  
Engineering and Production,and         
Technical Illustrations,the last are   
carried out in an annexe in Wharton    
Road.                                  
 Because of financial cuts,the college 
has dropped its Fine Arts degree       
course.A "Times" article in 1984       
expressed great concern.               
 The College has 557 students,from the 
area and from all over the country.    
Courses are quickly filled.Some        
students live in Hall in Wanstead Rd., 
others live in lodgings or at home.    </content>
