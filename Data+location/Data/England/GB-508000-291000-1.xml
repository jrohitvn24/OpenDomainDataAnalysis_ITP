		<title>01A summary of Elton and area</title>
		<content>  The village of Elton lies in the     
 extreme north-west of the survey area.
 The village lies along the A605 road  
 between Peterborough and Oundle,and   
 between that road and the River Nene. 
 Elton Hall,the home of the Proby      
 family for nearly four hundred years, 
 together with its park lies to the    
 south of the village.The river runs   
 over a weir and lock where a now      
 disused water-mill stands.The         
 population of the village is a mixture
 of those working more or less directly
 in farming,those who travel to        
 professional commercial and industrial
 work in nearby towns and a small group
 of well-to-do retired. Rolling country
 with mixed farming and woodland       
 occupies the rest of our block.A      
 by-pass road is planned to cut through
 this land to re-route the A605.
