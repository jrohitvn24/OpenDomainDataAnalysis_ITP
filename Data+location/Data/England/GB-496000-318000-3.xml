		<title>03WEEKEND IN CASTLE BYTHAM.</title>
		<content> On Saturday Clare rang me to ask if I 
 would like to deliver the Glenside    
 News with her.The Glenside News is a  
 little magazine for the parishes of   
 Castle Bytham,Little Bytham and Careby
 with Holywell and Aunby.I said        
 "yes".She met me at my house with a   
 black bag full of the magazines.We    
 took it in turns to deliver them.Half 
 way down Glen road I saw the two      
 gypsies who had called at our         
 house with a bag full of lace,but we  
 didn't buy any.Clare said "Would you  
 like to come to the plot? (which is   
 where Clare's dad is building their   
 new house).My dad is putting the      
 stairs in."                           
 When we got there the stairs were in  
 and Clare's dad said we could climb   
 up.It was all right going up but      
 coming down was a different matter!
