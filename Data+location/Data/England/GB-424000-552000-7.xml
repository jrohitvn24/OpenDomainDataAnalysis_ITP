		<content> About 2 miles from Chester-le-St. is a
 large Victorian farmstead with a      
 cottage for the farm workers plus a   
 few small storage buildings. This     
 farmstead is now used for{beef cattle 
 and{poultry.}When first built the farm
 had stables and byres. The loft was   
 used for hay. This farm is now rented 
 from a large property owner and 2     
 acres is ploughed so there is no need 
 for machinery. Most of the farming is 
 devoted to{poultry}which provides     
 casual employment before Christmas    
 when the{poultry}is plucked. There is 
 a large local population so there is a
 great demand for Christmas Turkeys and
 Chickens.                             
 There are many farms in this area and 
 the large{dairy}farm is 160 years old.
 The modern{dairy}is only 10 yrs. old  
 and an extension was built 3 yrs. ago.
