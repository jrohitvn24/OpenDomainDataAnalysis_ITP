		<title>11Hedges and Boundaries.</title>
		<content>  Many of the traditional hedges still 
 exist in Herefordshire.Most farms are 
 mixed farms which require smaller     
 fields and farmers tend to keep their 
 hedges well-maintained.               
   Several hedge counts were taken in  
 the area.In one hedge  five different 
 species were found indicating that the
 hedge was at least 400 years old.Most 
 of the hedges were 200 years old or   
 more.Hedge laying is rare now,most    
 farmers using mechanical machinery to 
 cut and shape hedges.                 
   The most common species found in the
 hedges were:hawthorn, holly ,willow   
 and horse chestnut.Others included    
 oak, aspen, alder and yew.            
   In the residential areas Leylandii  
 has become the most popular hedge,    
 mainly because it is fast growing and 
 developes into a dense hedge quickly.
