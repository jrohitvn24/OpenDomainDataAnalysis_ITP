		<content> IN AS FAR AS THERE IS NO OTHER        
 SETTLEMENT BETWEEN NORTH SOMERCOTES   
 AND THE BEACH THE VILLAGE IS COASTAL  
 BUT IT IS NOT WELL DEVELOPED AS A     
 HOLIDAY CENTRE - THE BEACH IS NOT VERY
 ATTRACTIVE AND THE SEA IS A LONG WAY  
 OUT.THERE IS HOWEVER A HOLIDAY CAMP ON
 THE EASTERN EDGE OF THE VILLAGE.IT IS 
 A CARAVAN CAMP WITH A CLUIB AND A     
 LAKE. THE LAST FEATURE IS THE RAISON  
 D'ETRE OF THE WHOLE.IT CAME INTO      
 EXISTENCE AS A RESULT OF GRAVEL       
 EXTRACTION FOR AIRFIELD CONSTRUCTION  
 IN RESPONSE TO THE GERMAN MILITRY     
 BUILD UP IN THE 1930S.PREVIOUS TO THAT
 THE AREA HAD BEEN USED AS A RSBBIT    
 WARREN BEING OF LITTLE USE FOR        
 ANYTHING ELSE BECAUSE OF IYS POOR     
 SOILS. PART OF THE ORIGINAL WARREN WAS
 ACQUIRED BY THE FORESTRY COMMISSION   
 AND PLANTED WITH CONIFERS IN 1960.THIS
 PLANTATION HAS SINCE PASSED IN PRIVATE</content>
