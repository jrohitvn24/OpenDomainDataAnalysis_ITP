		<content>   The area stretches from Seisdon in  
the west to the Staffordshire County   
Boundary at Wolverhampton in the east  
and from a line running through the    
hamlet of Trescott to Merryhill in the 
north to Trysull and Wombourne in the  
south.                                 
   It includes part of the village of  
Seisdon ,which gave its name to the old
County Hundred in Saxon times; Trysull,
Orton, and Lower Penn villages; and a  
small part of Wombourne village:       
   Mixed farming is the chief          
occupation with some quarrying of sand 
and gravel in the south-west.          
   The area is very open with little   
woodland and having had  many hedgerows
taken out to create larger,more        
economic fields. Several roads run     
between high banks.   Overhead         
electric power lines,radiating from    
Ebstree,dominate the scenery.          </content>
