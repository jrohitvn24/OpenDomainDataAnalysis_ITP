		<title>04TRADE GARDEN CENTRE LUTON</title>
		<content>We went to Farr's garden centre it has 
been open since October 1982. They sell
tropical fish, snakes they used to have
piranas.  Some fish are kept inside and
some outside. There was a snake about  
to eat a live mouse.                   
The centre opens at 9.30am and closes  
at 6pm.  The weekend is the busiest    
time especially Sunday. Deliveries to  
the centre are on Wednesday. There are 
car parks at side and back. There is a 
fun slide for children.                
They sell swimming pools, greenhouses, 
sheds,bricks and fences. Outside are   
benches and chairs inside patio sets   
for sale. Inside and outside are       
flowers and plants as well as seeds.   
There are garden tools, ddustbins and  
grills for barbecues.
