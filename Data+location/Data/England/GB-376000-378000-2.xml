		<content> I live in a council flat. All the     
 houses on the estate which is divided 
 by the Mobberley Road are built of    
 brick. Mostly they have 3 to 4 bed-   
 rooms.  Some, like mine, are split up 
 into flats. We have a gas fire and gas
 cooker, some have coal fires. There is
 a park across the road. It has a      
 slide, one swing and two climbing     
 frames; the other play things have    
 been wrecked by vandals. Near the park
 is a small wood.  The Macclesfield    
 Groundwork Trust has laid proper foot-
 paths through this and put benches at 
 intervals.  Quite near to our house is
 a small group of shops including a    
 newsagents, wine shop, D.I.Y. store   
 and supermarket, the Doctor's surgery 
 and a petrol filling station. Further 
 along the road is the Post Office and 
 a small new private housing estate    
 where the old paper mill used to be.  </content>
