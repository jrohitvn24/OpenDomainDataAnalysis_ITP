		<content> During World War Two milking parlours 
 &amp; mechanisation were introduced to    
 local farms.This trend has continued  
 resulting in a decreasing workforce.  
 Pre-war farms made cheese to conserve 
 summer milk for winter consumption.   
 The Milk Marketting Board &amp; bulk      
 collection stopped this practice.Now  
 farmhouse Cheshire is making a come-  
 back.After the war some large farms   
 were divided into smallholdings.This  
 trend is being reversed with 5 farms  
 currently amalgamating.In 1957 they   
 employed 13 workers but will now only 
 need 5.In the last 5 years new systems
 of drainage,hedge removal,pit filling 
 &amp; tree clearance have increased field 
 size allowing land to carry more stock
 &amp; crops.Even though housing continues 
 to spread out from Ellesmere Port &amp; a 
 new motorway starts in the area it    
 remains basically rural.              </content>
