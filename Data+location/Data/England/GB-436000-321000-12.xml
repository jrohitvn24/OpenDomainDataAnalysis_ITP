		<content> The area is rich in bird life-from the
 large handsome pheasant to goldfinch &amp;
 wren.Wood pigeons &amp; magpies are pests 
 as is the once protected collared     
 dove, near to houses. Woodlands       
 provide food &amp; nesting sites for many 
 types of titmouse, thrush, blackbird, 
 nuthatch, tree-creeper, yellow hammer,
 woodcock, dunnock, ,robin, chaffinch  
 bullfinch &amp; barn owls.Starling are    
 everywhere in ever-increasing numbers.
 Larks, partridges &amp; lapwings are to be
 seen &amp; heard in the fields &amp; in       
 winter, flocks of redwing &amp;           
 fieldfares.                           
 The various stretches of water provide
 suitable habitat for swan, coot,      
 moorhen, grebe, mallard, pintail duck 
 &amp; heron. There are visiting flocks of 
 Canada geese which move from one pond 
 or reservoir to another as do large   
 numbers of herring gulls.             </content>
