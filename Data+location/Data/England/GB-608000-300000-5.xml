   I walk to our school,which starts at
 9.00 a.m. After the bell rings I go to
 my classroom. All six classes go to   
 Assembly which is either acted out as 
 a play by a class or taken by our     
 Headmistress,Mrs.Warman. Afterwards,  
 we probably work in our Maths books   
 until playtime at 10.30 a.m. At 12.00 
 noon we line up for lunch. I have a   
 cooked dinner but I could take a      
 packed lunch. After lunch we play     
 until 1.15 p.m. when school starts    
 again. We may do English work, or have
 choir practice with Miss Wade, or go  
 out to football with Mr.Banham, our   
 Caretaker. We say a prayer before     
 going home at 3.00 p.m.               
{ASHLEIGH FIRST SCHOOL (Mrs Harrison)} 
   This school was opened in 1972 to   
 accommodate the increasing number of  
 children in Wymondham.                </content>
