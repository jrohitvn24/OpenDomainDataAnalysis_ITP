		<title>16Ingatestone High Street.</title>
		<content> Ingatestone has developed in a linear 
 fashion along the High Street. The    
 High Street contains most of the shops
 and businesses of the area; it is a   
 mixture of the old and the new. At the
 southern end of the High Street are   
 some{almshouses}which have been       
 recently restored; they are run by a  
 Catholic charity and preference is    
 given to retired Catholic clergy. In  
 the middle of the almshouses is a     
 small chapel. There is evidence of old
 coaching inns with stables in         
 courtyards and numerous old buildings.
 Ingatestone Parish church is set back 
 slightly from the High Street. In     
 contrast there are new buildings often
 housing shops on the ground floor with
 flats above or providing office space.
 None of the office buildings are      
 particularly large - the largest being
 the offices of Moody the builder.     </content>
