		<content>       The Village In Which I Live.    
  I live in Harrold; it is a quite a   
 small village but it has quite a few  
 facilities.                           
  There are four shops, two in the High
 Street, down by The Green, and the    
 other two are up at the other end of  
 the High Street.They are all food and 
 general shops, and one of them is a   
 butcher's shop.                       
 There are two garages, and two        
 hairdressers, at different ends of the
 village.                              
 I go to a Club for children from 8 to 
 13 years which is good fun, and it is 
 held in Harrold and in Carlton, a     
 nearby village.                       
 Other clubs include the W.I., a tennis
 club, a cricket club and other        
 associations which are held in The    
 Institute in the High Street.
