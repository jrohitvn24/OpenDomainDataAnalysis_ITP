		<content>     Courtlands Riding Stables is in   
 Todd's Green. It began with three     
 sisters and their ponies in 1969.Two  
 years later their parents obtained    
 planning permission to open a riding  
 stables with nine ponies. Over the    
 years since then the number of mounts 
 has grown to 35 of which 20 are ponies
 and 15 are horses. As they became more
 experienced they were able to increase
 the range of activities to include    
 exams,road safety work, one-day events
 gymkhanas and show jumping. Between 80
 and 100 riders use the stables each   
 week. This facility which many people 
 in the area use may soon be closed to 
 make way for a by-pass around the     
 village of Little Wymondley. Hopes    
 have been raised that an alternative  
 route to the north of the village may 
 be used instead.
