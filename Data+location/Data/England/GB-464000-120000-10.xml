		<title>10SHEEP FARMING</title>
		<content> I look after 700 ewes on a mixed      
 farm.They are divided into 5 flocks   
 and moved from field to field.        
 I have four working collies whose help
 is invaluable especially when moving  
 the flocks and bringing them down to  
 the farm for routine jobs such as     
 shearing dipping and foot trimming.The
 sheep are also brought down for       
 lambing and the early lambing at      
 Christmas is done inside, which gives 
 the lambs a much better chance.       
 The fat lambs are folded on roots for 
 a short time in winter, the rest are  
 fed hay and grain and kept on grass.  
 The work needs total                  
 commitment,particulary at lambing     
 time,but I personally would prefer no 
 other.
