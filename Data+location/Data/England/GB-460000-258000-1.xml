		<content>       Weedon Bec consists of three    
sections;Road Weedon,Upper Weedon and  
Weedon Bec.Road Weedon grew up around  
{Watling Street} and was originally    
known as Weedon-on-the-Street.         
  Weedon became more important when on 
the 21 June 1796 the {Grand Junction   
canal} was opened,crossing the village 
on a high embankment.                  
  On 14 June 1804 the large {Royal     
Military Depot} was begun.Three        
royal pavillions were built for {King  
George III} and his cabinet in case    
Napoleon invaded this Country.         
  In September 1838 the {London &amp;      
Birmingham Railway} was opened through 
the village.A siding served the depot. 
  Weedon is now a prosperous village   
with a wide range of facilities.Many of
the inhabitants work in London or      
Northampton.
