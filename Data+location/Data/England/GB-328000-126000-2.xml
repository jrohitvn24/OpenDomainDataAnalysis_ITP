		<title>02HILL FARM - HAY MOOR</title>
		<content>  Hill Farm has been in the same family
 for three generations.It's a dairy    
 farm and covers 230 acres.The farmer  
 and his wife work the farm on their   
 own but have a contractor to help with
 silaging.                             
  Their land on Hay Moor floods two or 
 three times a year, but despite this  
 the farmer said it was ideal milking  
 land.It was particularly good in the  
 dry summer.                           
  It is a Friesian herd of 129 cows and
 they keep one Hereford bull.They have 
 a milking parlour for twenty and milk 
 twice a day at 6am. and 4pm.They pro- 
 duce between a thousand and one       
 thousand-five hundred litres per      
 day.                                  
  In 1983 they installed a computer    
 system for feeding the herd.Each cow  
 now wears a microchip round her neck.
