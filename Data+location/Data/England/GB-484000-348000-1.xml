		<content>       Our area is comprised of parts  
 of the parishes of Claypole, Stubton  
 and Fenton and includes the three     
 actual villages. A few fields lie     
 within the parish of Dry Doddington.  
 The parts of the parishes of Claypole 
 occupy approximately 66% of the area, 
 Stubton 25%, Fenton 7% and Dry        
 Doddington 2%. The whole area is      
 predominately agricultural and nearly 
 all of this arable. Most of the land  
 is of strong clay or stiff loam.      
       The lower River Witham dominates
 the Western part of the block flowing 
 from the south to the north. The      
 adjacent land is low lying and, until 
 extensive drainage work made ploughing
 possible, was wholly meadowland.      
       Formally the London and North   
 Eastern Railway (L.N.E.R.), British   
 Rail's main North-South line runs     
 diagonally across the area.           </content>
