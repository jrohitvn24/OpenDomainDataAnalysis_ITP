		<title>04An Eversley Public Footpath</title>
		<content>    We went for a walk from the{       
{Eversley Footpath Book}to look at the 
 natural history around us. We crossed{
{Kingsley Road}and went over a stile   
 towards the vineyard. The vines had   
 new shoots and leaves on them. There  
 are many rabbits in this part of      
 Eversley. When we came to the forest  
 we discovered that it was mixed, with 
 mostly oak trees but also birch,      
 alder, hazel and white beam.          
    We came to a ditch with many holes 
 in the bank. We have seen rabbits and 
 water-rats there. We saw a yellow frog
 which we have identified as a common  
 frog, as they can be yellow           
 sometimes.We found flowers including  
 speedwell, stitchwort, buttercups,    
 daisies and bluebells.
