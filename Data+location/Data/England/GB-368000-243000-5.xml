		<content>  MR. HAWKINS                          
                                       
 The vicarage is quite a large house   
 and 4 to 6 people live in it.The      
 house is almost new it is only 15     
 years old.Not many people liked the   
 look of the house they said it        
 looked like pavements going up the    
 wall the porch looked rather odd.As   
 long as Mr Hawkins is vicar of Bosbury
 he owns the house and the land  that  
 goes with it which is about quarter of
 an acre altogether.The vicar said he  
 likes living in Bosbury because it is 
 peaceful and it is a nice area to live
 in. If he had a chance to move        
 to another house in Bosbury he said he
 would rather stay in the vicarage.We  
 asked him if he would like to stay in 
 Bosbury or would he rather move to    
 another village he answered he would  
 like to stay in Bosbury.              </content>
