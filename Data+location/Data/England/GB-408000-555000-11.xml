		<content> Ebchester is a small village,         
 population 1,200, on the east bank of 
 the River Derwent. The A694 runs      
 through Ebchester and the nearest     
 towns are Consett, 4 miles to the     
 south and Newcastle 14 miles to the   
 east. Ebchester is a mixture of very  
 old and modern buildings. The older   
 ones, some more than 200 years,are in 
 cluster in the centre of the          
 village, around the ariginally Norman 
 Church of St Ebba built around 1090 _ 
 1100 and restored in 1876. Building   
 which cannot be seen from the road are
 the remnants of a Roman Fort,         
 Vindomora, for Ebchester was a        
 Roman Settlement from about 80 AD.    
   The Commandant's house has been     
 excavated and can be seen at Mains    
 Farm, as can the small museum housing 
 items which have been                 
 found.e.g.jewellery,pottery etc.(cont)</content>
