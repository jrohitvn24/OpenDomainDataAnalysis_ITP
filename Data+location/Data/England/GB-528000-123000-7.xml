		<title>07PEOPLE'S JOBS IN CUCKFIELD 2</title>
		<content>  Unemployment is not really a problem 
 within Cuckfield as most people go for
 jobs outside the village. The younger 
 generation of males tend to opt for   
 manual jobs whilst catering is popular
 amongst young females. People at      
 present still seem able to follow     
 their chosen career and do not seem to
 be dictated to by the availability of 
 jobs. This may account for the fact   
 that{59.3%}had 'great' job            
 satisfaction,{25.9%}'fair' job        
 satisfaction and only{14.8%}'little'  
 job satisfaction. On starting their   
 jobs{68.75%}earned{Â£0-Â£3000, 18.75% } 
 earned{Â£3000-Â£9000}and{12.5%}earned { 
{Â£10,000-Â£16,000.}At present           
 approximately{40%}of the people of    
 Cuckfield earn above{Â£14,000}per year.
