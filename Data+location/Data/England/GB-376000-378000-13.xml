		<title>13MOBBERLEY CRICKET CLUB</title>
		<content>      The Cricket Club was founded in  
 1876 but has played on its present    
 ground near the Church since 1891.    
 Two teams play on Saturday and one on 
 Sunday and there is a team of juniors.
 The Club is a member of the Cheshire  
 League which comprises twelve teams.  
                                       
      In 1976, Mobberley C.C.          
 celebrated its centenary with a full  
 weeks cricket including a match       
 against a Cheshire eleven.            
                                       
      In 1982 the Selangor Club of     
 Kuala Lumper played Mobberley C.C. and
 a reciprocal visit was made in        
 September 1984.  Mobberley won the    
 first but lost the second game.
