		<content> Most of the housing was concentrated  
 in the south and east of our block.   
 There was a large amount of farming in
 the rest of it. Around {Eccleston}and 
{Windle}there were new housing estates 
 with housing ranging from Â£30,000     
 upwards.Mostly they are semi_detached 
 but there are some detached.There are 
 some bungalows.Mixed in are some older
 houses with a row of 100 year old     
 cottages in  Rainford Road.           
   Near{Billinge}and {Moss Bank}there  
 is a large council estate dating  from
 the post war era.Around{Cowley Hill,  
  and {Dentons Green}. Here are several
  roads  of pre 1945 terraced houses   
 many of whose occupants used to works 
 at the nearby Pilkington works . A few
 very large detached houses from the   
 last century are situated in the rural
 north surrounded by landscaped        
 gardens. {                            </content>
