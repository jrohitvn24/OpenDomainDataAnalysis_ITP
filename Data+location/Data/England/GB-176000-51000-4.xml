		<title>04Description of Ventongimps</title>
		<content> Many years ago,Ventongimps was called 
 Fenton Gumpus and was a busy place    
 with horses and carts.It is now a     
 picturesque,quiet country village.I   
 live in a house called Bridge House   
 which was once the village shop.It is 
 about two hundred years old.Over the  
 road to us is Ventongimps Mill.Part of
 it is in ruins,but most of it is still
 in good condition.                    
  In Ventongimps there is a spring that
 never stops.Our water in the house is 
 run from the spring.The water is very 
 fresh.                                
  Not many people live in Ventongimps  
 now,but they are all very friendly and
 it is a very pleasant place to live   
 with a very warm atmosphere.          
  Most of the residents have their own 
 transport due to the fact that there  
 is no public transport available in   
 the vicinity.                         </content>
