		<title>07Watercress</title>
		<content> Running through the village is a      
 stream. Watercress is cultivated in   
 this stream and has been for at least 
 a couple of centuries. it was sold in 
 London street markets and it has a    
 place in many local markets today. It 
 is sold in the village from a hut at  
 50p for large bunch. Local residents  
 say that there is a bit of local folk 
 lore about the watercress beds. Any   
 young couple gazing out across the    
 growing cress will soon be announcing 
 the birth of a baby. Several older    
 residents testify that this has       
 proved to be the case in their own    
 experience.
