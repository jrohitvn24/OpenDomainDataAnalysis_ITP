		<title>15SHERRARDS CENTRE</title>
		<content> Sherrards is a training centre for    
 handicapped young people.  It provides
 vocational assessment and training    
 using electrical and mechanical       
 assembly, packing, light engineering  
 and wood-working as a basis for work  
 experience.  The centre also provides 
 social and independence training as an
 integral part of the course.          
 Sherrards was opened by the Spastics  
 Society in 1958 to cater for people   
 with cerebral palsy.  Today, people   
 with other handicaps are also         
 considered for training.  The centre  
 stands in its own grounds in Welwyn   
 Garden City.  The aim of the centre is
 to try to help young handicapped      
 people to prepare themselves for      
 employment and to try to help them    
 find jobs.  It also encourages the    
 trainees to become as independent as  
 possible in their daily lives.        </content>
