		<title>10SKELMERSDALE - RIVER TAWD</title>
		<content> The River Tawd flows through the town 
 of Skelmersdale. From its source at   
 Billinge it follows a winding and     
 sometimes underground course till it  
 joins the River Douglas near Parbold, 
 which then flows out to the sea at    
 Hesketh Bank.                         
 Sadly it is a very polluted river and 
 the Douglas into which it flows is    
 also dead. Various attempts have been 
 made to find the main industrial and  
 domestic sources of this pollution and
 it is hoped that it might again become
 a clean river supporting fish and     
 other wild life on its banks which    
 form a fine ammenity for the town.    
 Nearer to its confluence with the     
 Douglas it flows through the          
 Merseyside Scouts permanent Camp Site 
 adding greatly to the interest of this
 youth facility.
