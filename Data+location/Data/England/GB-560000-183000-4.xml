 lambing and how do you cope?{"Lambing 
{time is usually between February and  
{June. What do you mean by how do I    
{cope?".}I mean how do you know they   
 are going to have them in the middle  
 of the night?{"You dont."}What crops  
 do you grow?{"All sorts, such as      
{wheat, barley and corn".}Do you have a
