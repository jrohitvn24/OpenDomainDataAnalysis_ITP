		<content> Wortley Forge was built in 1621       
 Wortley Forge was used to make canon  
 balls and metal rods that were made   
 into nails.They also made railway     
 axles for all the new steam-trains    
 being built.The forge also made iron  
 bars to send to other mills on the    
 river.Some made them into wire,some   
 into shovels e.t.c.We saw a big water 
 wheel made out of iron.There were     
 three other water wheels.Two made the 
 hammers go and one made the bellows   
 go.The Forge doesn,t make anything now
 but you can go and look round.In the  
 museum there was a model of the forge 
 of what  it looked like in the olden  
 days.In a museum there are some old   
 things that they used to use like an  
 iron,horse shoe,key,box and a         
 nail.Wortley Forge has a steam-weekend
 about twice a year.
