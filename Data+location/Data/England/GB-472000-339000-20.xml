		<content> 1985 is a depressing time all over the
 country. Mostly people complain all   
 the time because they want the        
 villages to be nicer places to live.  
 When people were asked what sort of   
 things they wanted they said that they
 wanted a cycle path all the way to    
 Bingham because the road is a very    
 busy one. Some even said silly things 
 like the telephone boxes should have  
 keys to keep them from being damaged. 
 Generally most people liked the       
 village and did not want to make many 
 changes hardly anyone said that they  
 would rather live somewhere else.     
 Aslockton is the starting point of the
 South Notts hunt, lots of people go on
 it but many people in the village     
 think that it is a horrible sport. It 
 is mostly the farmers that go on it   
 and the people who do other jobs don't
 like it.                              </content>
