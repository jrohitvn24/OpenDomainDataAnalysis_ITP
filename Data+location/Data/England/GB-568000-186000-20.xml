		<content> BASILDON HAS A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE AND
 A LOT OF OLD PEOPLE. THE COUNCIL WAS  
 VERY CONCERNED ABOUIT THE OLD PEOPLE  
 AND THEY ARE VERY WELL CATERED FOR IN 
 BASILDON. THERE ARE CENTRES WERE THEY 
 CAN MEET AND WHERE THEY CAN GET A HOT 
 DINNER. THEY COUNCIL STARTED A PLAY   
 CENTRE SCHEME, AND NOW EVERY          
 NEIGHBOURHOOD HAS A PALY CENTRE THAT  
 IS OPEN ALL DAY DURING THE SCHOOL     
 HOLIDAYS. THERE ARE NOW TWO CINEMAS   
 AND A BOWLING ALLEY, AND MANY THINGS  
 FOR PEOPLE TO DO IN THEIR LEISURE     
 TIME. WHEN THE TOWN WAS FIRST BUILT   
 THESE FACILITIES WERE NOT HERE.       
                                       
 BASILDON IS NOW AN ESTABLISHED TOWN,  
 AND MOST OF THE PEOPLE LIVING IN IT   
 SEEM T LIKE LIVING HERE.
