		<content>      I get up about 6.30 am, go down  
 stairs, make tea &amp; toast for my       
 sisters &amp; mum, my dad has gone to     
 work. Then I watch{television,        
{Wideawake Club}at 8.30 am, a variety  
 programme with pop singers, cartoons, 
 interviews. Sometimes I watch{World of
{Sport}at 12 noon. I sometimes go{     
{swimming at Basildon Pool}with my dad 
 or play out with my friends. I usually
 have a sandwich, an apple and yoghurt 
 for my lunch at 12 o'clock. Sometimes 
 I go out shopping in the afternoon    
 with my mum, while the video records{ 
{World of Sport}.                      
      Sometimes I play out, or stay in 
 and draw pictures or watch television.
 I have my tea about 6 pm and watch the
 late night television programmes and  
 go to bed at about half past nine. I  
 have to have a bath before I go to    
 bed.                                  </content>
