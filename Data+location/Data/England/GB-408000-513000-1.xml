		<content> The A66 is the main route across the  
 Pennines from the M6 in the west to   
 the A1 in the east. The Tees, rising  
 on Cross Fell, flows south and east to
 the North Sea.  At Rokeby, road and   
 river almost meet.  That the two      
 follow a similar route is the result  
 of the action of the Stainmore Glacier
 which flowed eastwards from the       
 Cumbrian Ice Cap.  The steep descent  
 from the Pennines having been         
 accomplished, road and river begin a  
 more gentle descent eastwards from    
 Rokeby and at about 150m above sea    
 level the character of the land       
 changes from moorland to rich         
 agricultural.                         
 Small mixed farms of about 180 acres, 
 some owner-occupied, but many         
 belonging to estates such as Mortham, 
 are dotted everywhere. Agriculture and
 its service industries predominate.   </content>
