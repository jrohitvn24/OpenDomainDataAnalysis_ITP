		<title>19THE LIVE AID POP FESTIVAL</title>
		<content> On the 13th of July on BBC 2 they had 
 a Live Aid pop festival for the       
 starving people of Africa.At first    
 they showed you the pictures of the   
 starving people of Etheopia. Then they
 had a pop festival staring singers    
 from all over the world. People sent  
 in hundreds of thousands of pounds.   
 The festival lasted from noon Saturday
 until 4 am Sunday morning.            
 Bob Geldorf is the man who orgainised 
 it all. He started planning how to    
 raise money for the starving Africans 
 after a visit to Etheopia. He         
 organised a record called "Feed the   
 World" which raised several million   
 pounds, then he went on to organise   
 the Live Aid Concert. They hope this  
 will eventually raise over forty      
 million pounds.
