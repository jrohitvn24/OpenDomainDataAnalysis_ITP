		<content>                                       
 The popular Portsmouth stadium near   
 the Mountbatten Centre has regular    
 races,even in the holidays.Racing     
 starts at 11am.  with 10              
 races with 15 minutes intervals       
 between each one.Each greyhound       
 starts the race in a trap. A hare     
 (fake) is sent round the track and    
 when the traps open the greyhounds    
 follow.The winner crosses the finish  
 line first.It costs Â£1.00 to watch the
 races in the open air and Â£2.00 to    
 watch from the bar.  People bet on    
 greyhounds,and after each race the    
 results are put up on a screen.       
 Greyhound racing is fun to watch and  
 doesn't cost much for an enjoyable day
 out.Built in 1931,the stadium seats   
 1,500,has a 380 metre track and the   
 best greyhound ever was Hey There     
 Merry(1960-62).                       </content>
