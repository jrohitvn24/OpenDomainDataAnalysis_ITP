		<content> Questions asked in a shopping area    
 and                                   
 in the rural parts indicate that more 
 than half of the residents think that 
 our young town can have{traditions.}  
 The{Water Carvival, Barn Theatre      
{Festival}and{Lemsford Fete}were the   
 most  frequently named existing       
 traditions.                           
 Most people seem to like events to    
 become customs and suggestions for the
 future included sports events such as 
 the "Half-marathon Fun-run", street   
 carnivals and other community         
 gatherings.                           
{Folk stories}do not seem to be very   
 common, only the story linking the    
 song 'Nellie Dean' with Lemsford Mill 
 was actually told to the              
 investigators.                        
                                       
                                       </content>
