		<title>12STOKE PARK HOSPITAL.</title>
		<content>{STOKE PARK}IS A HOSPITAL FOR MENTALLY 
 HANDICAPPED PATIENTS. THE OLDEST      
 BUILDING, THE DOWER HOUSE, WAS BUILT  
 IN 1805 BY THE DUKE OF BEAUFORT FOR   
 HIS MOTHER. THIS, AND THE OTHER       
 BUILDINGS, WERE OPENED AS A HOSPITAL  
 IN 1917, AND HAVE BEEN EXTENDED OVER  
 THE YEARS.                            
   THERE ARE 444 PATIENTS, MEN AND     
 WOMEN, THE YOUNGEST OF WHOM IS ELEVEN.
 THERE ARE 23 WARDS, WITH BETWEEN 8 AND
 25 PATIENTS COMPARED WITH 120 PER WARD
 IN THE EARLY DAYS.SOME OF THE PATIENTS
 HAVE BEEN THERE FOR OVER 50 YEARS.    
 VERY FEW PATIENTS ARE NOW ADMITTED    
 BECAUSE THE POLICY IS TO LOOK AFTER   
 THE MENTALLY HANDICAPPED WITHIN THE   
 COMMUNITY AS FAR AS POSSIBLE. INSTEAD 
 THE HOSPITAL TAKES IN A LOT OF        
 SHORT-STAY PATIENTS WHO COME FOR A    
 WEEKEND OR A WEEK WHILE THEIR PARENTS 
 HAVE A REST OR GO ON HOLIDAY.         </content>
