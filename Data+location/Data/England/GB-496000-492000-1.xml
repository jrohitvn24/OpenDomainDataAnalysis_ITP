 farming and forestry large conferous  
 plantations cover some of the higher  
 grounds and steep slopes while sheep, 
 dairy and arable farming predominate  
 in the flat south section and in the  
 north easten areas.  Roads are minor  
 and the only village is a collection  
 of a few houses or farms at silpho,   
 and there are a few more farms        
 scattered about. As a rural area,     
 hilly and forested it is much visited 
 by tourists who enjoy the walking and 
 superb views from such places as      
 Reasty Hill top which there are       
 forestry commission parking and picnic
 sites.  there are some deeduous       
 woodlands to add  to the variety.     
 There are no other amenities so       
 tourists just visit for the day and   
 drive or walk through.  Residents are 
 mostly involved in farming.           </content>
