		<content>  A major employer in South East Essex 
is the Ford Motor Company. In 1967 the 
Dunton Research and Engineering Centre 
was opened. It employs about 3,000     
people on a site covering 111 hectares.
  New models are designed and tested at
Dunton. Extensive use is made of       
computer models for design, and all of 
the components are given rigorous tests
  An important current project is      
development of an engine which gives   
better fuel economy and does not emit  
lead fumes into the atmosphere. The    
European Community is worried about    
how the environment is affected by     
petrol fumes and is preparing laws     
to reduce emission levels. Fords have  
made a lot of progress and hope to     
have an efficient engine commercially  
available in the near future.
