		<title>08HOTEL INTERVIEW(cont.)</title>
		<content>has changed very little.               
From Mon. to Thurs. he is always fully 
booked.To work at this hotel,a 1 year  
college course is required.Students    
from the college come for work         
experience at the hotel.The best thing 
about being manager of a hotel is the  
organisation and variety.The worst     
thing is as you get older you think    
about the long hours and retiring.     
As it is   3-star hotel it has to      
have a lounge and limited room         
service. Apart from the occasional     
pool tournament,the hotel has no       
sports facilities.The only modern      
equipment is a small computer to help  
with finance. Mr. Eric is a man who    
loves his job but is thinking of       
retiring,and is beginning to regret    
being single because his job will not  
last forever.  Mr. Eric seems to be    
happy and the hotel happy with him.    </content>
