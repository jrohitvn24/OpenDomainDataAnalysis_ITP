		<title>10Our visit to Court Farm</title>
		<content>{Court Farm}was built in the 15th or   
 16th Century and there was a moat     
 round it. The farm building lies      
 behind{All Saints Church}and most     
 fields are within easy reach. The     
 owner keeps 500 sheep. He has 200     
 acres in{Longhope}and also rents land 
 from other farmers. He grows{turnips, 
{hay}and uses large areas for{grazing} 
 .The land is steep but he has good    
 drainage and access. The owner uses   
 the market in{Gloucester}to buy and   
 sell. The farm is run by members of   
 his family and the two sheep dogs are 
 family pets.
