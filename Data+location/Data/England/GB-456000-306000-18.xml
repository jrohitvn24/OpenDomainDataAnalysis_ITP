		<title>18SECONDARY SCHOOL LIFE</title>
		<content> I go to Beaumont Leys School.There are
 1200 pupils at my school aged from 11 
 to 19,so it is quite abig school and  
 when I started it was easy to get     
 lost.There are 70 teachers plus       
 librarians,secretaries,dinner staff   
 and technicians.In years 1 to 3 we    
 study we all the same subjects.My     
 favourites are Drama,Dance,and        
 Science.In the fourth year we choose  
 from a whole range of subjects,some of
 which,like Business Studies and       
 Computing,have not been available     
 before.In years 4 and 5 we also go on 
 Community Service and Work Experience.
  In our large Sixth Form pupils can   
 take "A"level examinations or follow a
 vocational course such as Childcare.  
  There are after-school activities    
 like sports matches,theatre           
 visits,Music and Drama clubs and      
 Computing club(my favourite!).        </content>
