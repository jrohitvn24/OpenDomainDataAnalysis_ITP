		<title>02COBERLEY VILLAGE AMENITIES</title>
		<content> Coberley village is very small; it    
 only contains 30-40 houses. It has a  
 tiny school with only 22 pupils.      
  The village has both gas and         
 electricity supplies, but has no      
 street lights. There is one telephone 
 kiosk, used by many because 50% of the
 houses don't have telephones.         
  The church has its own vicar who     
 holds two services in a week (both on 
 Sunday). He also looks after three    
 other parishes.                       
  A travelling library visits the      
 village once a week and a lot of      
 people borrow books.                  
  There are no scouts or any other     
 organisations.                        
  A bus stops every two hours and there
 is one post office which is the only  
 shop in Coberley.                     
  There is also a spring in the village
 which provides fresh water.           </content>
