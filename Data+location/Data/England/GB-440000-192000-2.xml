		<content>CEREAL CROPS.                          
Many of the fields in our D-Block are  
used for growing cereal crops such as  
barley, wheat, corn and rye grass.     
FARM ANIMALS.                          
Some of the land in our area was used  
as pasture land for livestock,such as  
sheep and cows.                        
HARVESTING.                            
Some of the fields had already been    
harvested and had bales stacked in     
them.                                  
CHILDREY and LETCOMBE BROOK.           
Both Childrey and Letcombe brook run   
through our block. They are fairly     
clear,quite fast flowing and both have 
some fish in them.
