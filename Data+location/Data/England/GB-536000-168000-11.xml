		<title>11Beckenham Manor</title>
		<content>   Beckenham was first mentioned in the
 ninth century  A.D.                   
  In the 11th Century the Domesday Book
 records that Anchil held the Manor in 
 1066 and Angscot held it after for    
 Bishop Odo(half-brother of William the
 Conquerer),to whom it was given after 
 the conquest.                         
  From the 11th to the 18th Centuries  
 the Manor passed through the hands of 
 various stewards,some of whom were    
 closely associated or even related to 
 the sovereign.                        
  In 1773 Viscount Bolingbroke and St  
 John sold it to his nephew ,John      
 Cator.                                
  In the nineteenth and twentieth      
 centuries feudal rights were gradually
 eroded and the land sold by the Cator 
 family.Part of the arms of the Cator  
 family is found on the Cator Park     
 School badge.                         </content>
