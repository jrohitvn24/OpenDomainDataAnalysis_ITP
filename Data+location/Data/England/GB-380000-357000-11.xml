		<title>11HOUSING</title>
		<content> The housing found within the area of  
 the grid is mainly owner occupied     
 property.                             
 In both Rode Heath and Scholar Green  
 there are few council houses to be    
 found.                                
 In Rode Heath up until twelve years   
 ago the only housing to be found used 
 to straddle the A533 road to Sandbach 
 or run alongside the canal.Alot of    
 these houses were terraced and housed 
 workers from the local salt mines or  
 boat people.Since then a large housing
 estate has been built.The houses on   
 the estate are mainly three bedroomed 
 semi-detatched Dormer houses although 
 there are some larger detatched houses
 and some bungalows.In Scholar Green   
 the is a mixture of semi-detached,    
 detached,bungalows and terraced       
 housing.However of the two villages   
 Rode Heath is by far the larger.      </content>
