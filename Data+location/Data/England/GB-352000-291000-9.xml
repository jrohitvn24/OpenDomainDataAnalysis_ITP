		<content> In November the dairy herd is brought 
 in to be housed for the winter in the 
 cubicle shed.The{cows}are fed on      
 silage which is available for them to 
 help themselves at any time.The Welsh 
 half breed{ewes}are lambed after Xmas 
 and this is also the start of the     
 calving season.Springtime is the time 
 to spread fertilisers to encourage    
 growth of early grass in preparation  
 for cows to be let out again, also the
 silage to be cut and stored.Corn crops
 are sprayed for disease and weed      
 prevention and dressed with fertiliser
{Lambs}are marketed when heavy enough.A
 2nd crop of silage is cut in Summer,  
 corn crops are harvested and straw is 
 baled for winter litter.This year it  
 has been a difficult harvest due to   
 bad weather and the newly introduced  
 milk quotas have hit many farmers.
