		<content>    On Christmas Day we go to our      
 relatives' house.My grandad dresses up
 as Father Christmas and gives out     
 presents.We play a game and the winner
 opens his present first.We have a cake
 with fifty pence pieces baked in it.We
 play such games as Bob the Apple and  
 Blindman's Buff.                      
     On Shrove Tuesday we cook pancakes
 and toss them.Some people eat them    
 with lemon and sugar,we put honey and 
 nuts on ours.The whole family like    
 pancakes,so we have lots.             
    We celebrate Easter and Christmas. 
 We go to church once on Good Friday   
 and twice on Easter Sunday.Which ever 
 day Christmas is on,we go to church.  
 The whole of my family are Christians.
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
