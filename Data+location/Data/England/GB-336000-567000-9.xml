		<title>09Farmer's Mart/Longtown.</title>
		<content> In 1926 some farmers from both sides  
 of the border decided to start an     
 Auction Mart to sell the numbers of   
 Fat Cattle and Fat Sheep produced in  
 the Longtown and Border Area.The      
 Cumberland and Dumfriesshire Auction  
 Mart Ltd.was the name given as the    
 Board of Directors came from both     
 counties.From small beginnings the    
 Mart has expanded by being able to    
 acquire the land from the road bridge 
 out of Longton to Smalmstown on the   
 Gretna Rd,including the ponds. The    
 numbers of livestock for sale has     
 increased as farming methods have     
 altered,resulting in 300,000 sheep and
 20,000 cattle passing through the     
 auction annually.In order to cope with
 these numbers new premises have been  
 built comprising offices,restaurant,  
 and selling ring,with extensive stock 
 holding pens.                         </content>
