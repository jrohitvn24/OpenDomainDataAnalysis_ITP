		<title>03Abbotsley Oldest Inhabitant</title>
		<content> We went to interview Mrs Flint who was
 a nurse during the first world war.She
 is still very interested in farming.  
 She's lived in Abbotsley for 85 years 
 so when she came to Abbotsley it was  
 1900 and she was a little girl.She    
 later married a local farmer. She goes
 to St.Neots once a week with an old   
 lady who lives next door.Her son takes
 them.Mrs Flint has no children or     
 granchildren.She likes old and slow   
 songs. She is the oldest lady in      
 Abotsley.If she had to have two pets  
 she would have a dog and a horse.Mrs  
 Flint is a bit deaf but she seems like
 a young lady because of the way she   
 talks. She loves talking. Mrs Flint   
 lives in one of the bungalows built   
 for the older inhabitants.
