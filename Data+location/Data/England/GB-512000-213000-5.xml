		<content> The Harpenden Trust has been going for
 thirty seven years.   It gives  people
 advice, help, food, money  and coal.  
 The Trust was started by Lord Hill    
 of Luton and Mr Ackroyd, a local baker
 in 1948.                              
                                       
 Every year the Trust has a collection.
 The first time they had a collection  
 they raised Â£20 last year(1984) the   
 Trust raised Â£2,000.                  
                                       
 At Christmas the Trust gives food     
 parcels to people who have not much   
 money.   Also at Christmas some Trust 
 people stay with lonely people who    
 have no friends or relatives.         
                                       
 The Harpenden Trust is a community    
 service and aims to help people in    
 need.
