 unclassified road five miles west of  
{Launceston}in Cornwall.Less than a    
 mile to the north runs the{River      
{Ottery,}and the{River Kensey}runs     
 through the southern outskirts of the 
 village. Both rivers join the{Tamar}at
 Launceston. There are 40 to 50 houses 
 in the village, and a population of   
 100 to 150 people.Coming from         
 Launceston you first reach the area   
 called Hole, where a road turns off to
 the next parish, North Petherwin.     
 There are half-a-dozen houses here and
 a Methodist Chapel. One hundred and   
 fifty metres further on is the main   
 part of the village, clustered around 
 the church, which is dedicated to St. 
 Corantius.Opposite the church is a    
 cul-de-sac, with half-a-dozen houses  
 facing on to a cobbled courtyard. Next
 door to the church is the Post Office.</content>
