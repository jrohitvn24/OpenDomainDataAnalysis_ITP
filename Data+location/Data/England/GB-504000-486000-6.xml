		<title>06Litter and Vandalism</title>
		<content>{Litter}is a serious problem in        
 Scarborough. Tourists are very untidy 
 and they drop tons of{Litter}on the   
 beach and foreshore. This is illegal  
 but so many people do it the Police   
 cannot prosecute everyone. It costs   
 the Council Â£250,000 per year to clean
 up the town. The sand is cleaned by   
 a special machine everyday.{Vandalism 
 is another bad problem. Most of it is 
 caused by young, sometimes drunken,   
 people. They uproot trees and plants, 
 throw park benches into ponds and     
 spray grafitti on walls.{Vandalism}in 
 toilets costs Â£25,000 a year. New     
 trees and plants cost Â£2,000 and      
 broken glass costs Â£10,000.{Vandals}  
 have sprayed gravestones and even     
 thrown lifebuoys into the sea. Not all
 the{Vandals}are young. Local dog      
 owners allow their pets to foul parks 
 and paths. They should know better.   </content>
