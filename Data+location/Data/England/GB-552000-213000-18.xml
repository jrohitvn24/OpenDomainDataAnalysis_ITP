		<title>18I Live in Hatfield Heath</title>
		<content> I live in Hatfield Heath which is in  
 Uttlesford District Council.          
 Uttlesford is divided into parishes   
 and ours is called Hatfield Broad Oak.
 There are about 550 houses and 2000   
 people living in our village.  There  
 are different kinds of houses such as 
 timber frame or plaster as well as    
 brick built and many of the houses are
 thatched.  Some of the older houses   
 still have cellars.  There are various
 activities going on like Heath Players
 - an amateur dramatic group founded by
 Christopher Timothy as well as the    
 usual ones like Scouts and Brownies   
 etc.  There are four public houses    
 which become very popular in the      
 summer when people visit the Heath and
 two very good restaurants.  I love    
 living here in the peace and          
 tranquility of village life so do come
 and visit us soon.                    </content>
