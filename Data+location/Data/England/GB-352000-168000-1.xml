		<title>01LONG ASHTON &amp; SURROUNDINGS</title>
		<content>  Our 12 square kilometers lie to the  
 south west of Bristol. The area has   
 much countryside. Much of the land has
 lush grass which is used for dairying.
 However, some is arable, where wheat  
 and other crops can be grown. The     
 main feature of the area is the       
 village of Long Ashton itself, with a 
 population of 6000. Long Ashton lies  
 on the side of a valley, stretching up
 the hill to the north. At the top of  
 the hill there are plantations of     
 trees. Long Ashton is very much a     
 village, but could quite easily have  
 become a part of Bristol. It remains  
 independent because of Ashton Court,  
 once a large private estate, now      
 publicly-owned. At one time Long      
 Ashton was on the main route from     
 Weston-super-Mare to Bristol, but in  
 1969 a by-pass was built to divert the
 traffic, making the village less busy.</content>
