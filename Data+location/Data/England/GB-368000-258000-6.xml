		<title>06HEALTH IN TEDSTONE DELAMERE</title>
		<content> Most people living in this area are   
 farmers or workers on the land and    
 therefore working out of doors most of
 the time. As a result they appear to  
 be long-lived reaching the 80's or    
 90's. The main calls for medical      
 treatment are accident, childbirth or 
 illnesses connected with old age. The 
 nearest Doctors Surgery is at         
 Knightwick 3 miles SE of the area,    
 with two Doctors in attendance, they  
 hold two surgeries each weekday, and  
 one on Saturday. There is also a      
 surgery twice a week at Clifton.This  
 service is under the National Health  
 Scheme. Expectant mothers travel to   
 Worcester and accident victims will be
 transported by ambulance either to    
 Worcester or Hereford. If             
 hospitalisation is required patients  
 will be taken into one of the 3       
 hospitals in Worceter.                </content>
