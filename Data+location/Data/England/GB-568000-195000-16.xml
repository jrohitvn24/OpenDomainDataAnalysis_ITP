		<title>16 THE ADDER PATCH</title>
		<content>  Two hundred metres west of the       
 village of Ramsden Heath  is the adder
 patch.There are only a few adders left
 there now. It takes about an hour to  
 get to the adder patch because there  
 are two bogs in the way. When you     
 do reach there the effort has been    
 worth while because the adder patch is
 used as a scramble course.Perhaps this
 is why there are not many adders      
 there now.                            
  There are hills and jumps,bumps and  
 lumps.Horses go there as well, so     
 we have to be careful. We go on       
 our motor bikes and it is really      
 good fun.
