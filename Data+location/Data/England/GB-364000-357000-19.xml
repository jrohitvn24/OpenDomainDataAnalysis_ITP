		<content>{The leisure activities of the children
 divide into 2 groups;those centred on 
 school and those on home or community.
 Few of the children stay for after    
 school activities because of the      
 timing of the school bus.{Watching    
{television}is the most popular pastime
 for children but there is a wide      
 variety of other pursuits;e.g.horse-  
 riding,swimming,computer games,music, 
 fishing &amp; reading.{Membership of clubs
{or societies}is rare.{Adult pastimes  
 follow a similar pattern,with T.V. the
 most popular.Other activities include 
 gardening,walking,swimming,keep-fit,  
 whist,reading &amp; darts. Membership     
 of clubs &amp; societies is again rare,   
 but the two organisations most often  
 subscribed to are{Worleston Women's   
{Institute and Nantwich Young Farmers' 
{Club.
