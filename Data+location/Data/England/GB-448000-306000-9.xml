		<content>    Groby and the surrounding villages 
 have joined a community link scheme   
 run by Action Aid.We sponsor a small  
 village in Somalia called Owr Boogeys.
 Every year for five years we have to  
 raise 2 000 pounds to send to our link
 village.From this money the village   
 has decided to extend the local school
 and employ more teachers,thus offering
 the chance of education to more       
 pupils.In addition a clean water well 
 is being dug and agricultural         
 efficiency improved.                  
    To raise money many different      
 events have been staged -a roller     
 disco,Spring and Summer Fayres and a  
 parachute jump being just a few.      
 Frequent newsletters are received from
 the village and occasionally visits   
 are made by a representative who has  
 been to the community to see the work 
 at first hand.                        </content>
