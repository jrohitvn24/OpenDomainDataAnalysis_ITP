		<content>    The local newspaper is the "North  
 Devon Journal Herald" which was       
 started in 1884. It covers all types  
 of news, has a "Readers Letters" page,
 sports page, public notices, and      
 several pages of items for sale -     
 mainly house property and cars.       
 The cost is 16p.                      
    There are also two free weekly     
 newspapers, the "Advertiser" which    
 started in 1978 and the "Gazette"     
 which was first delivered in 1983.    
 They both contain items of local news 
 and are financed by their             
 advertisments.                        
    In 1976 a TV mast was erected in   
 the village.  This has enabled almost 
 every home to receive good clear BBC1,
 BBC2 and ITV pictures. Channel 4 is   
 not yet available.  In 1982 Devon     
 Local Radio started and broadcasts for
 96 hours each week.                   </content>
