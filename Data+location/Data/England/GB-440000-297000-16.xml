		<title>16Public Pathways</title>
		<content> There are many footpaths around       
 Dadlington and Stoke Golding which    
 provide pleasant walking for the      
 puplic.As many of the paths through   
 farmland, the walker must remember to 
 close the gates.                      
 A popular path runs alongside the     
 Ashby Canal. It is,in fact, the       
 towpath and is still used by a horse- 
 aptly named"Bosworth" who draws a     
 pleasure barge.                       
 There are trackways through Ambion    
 Wood but these are virtually          
 impassable in the summer as the       
 vegetationis very dense.              
 The paths through Lodge Farmhave been 
 renovated recently to cope with the   
 expected influx of visitors           
 celebrating the 500th Anniversary of  
 the Battle of Bosworth.
