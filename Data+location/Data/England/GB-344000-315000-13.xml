		<title>13THE ISLE CONT'D.</title>
		<content> Within the large,sweeping meander of  
 the severn which dominates much of    
 the centre of our area,is an isolated 
 area known as "the Isle".It is almost 
 entirely surrounded by the river and  
 must once have formed an attractive   
 defensive site.Within it is a moated  
 site of unknown date and origin,which 
 has the ruins of a chapel close by.   
 Presumably,it was a fortified manor   
 with its own chapel.Today,the area    
 is farmed by the Isle farm and        
 beyond that a large lake with an      
 attractive Georgian style country     
 house of modest proportions.          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
