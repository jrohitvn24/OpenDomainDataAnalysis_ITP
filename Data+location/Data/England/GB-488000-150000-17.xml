		<title>17Gipsies in Ash.</title>
		<content>   The gipsies or 'Travellers' as they 
 prefer to be called have been a part  
 of the scene in Ash since the begining
 of the century.                       
   The original families bought plots  
 of land in the area known as The      
 Quadrant between the two railway      
 lines. They lived in 'benders' which  
 are tents made out of tarpaulins      
 streched over ash poles.              
   The families spent the summer doing 
 farm work in the area and travelling  
 on waggons drawn by a horse with a    
 second horse to help on the hills.    
 They helped with fruit picking,       
 hay-making ,harvest and hop picking   
 and other seasonal jobs.              
   Many of the original families are   
 still in the village and live in the  
 council houses that have replaced the 
 benders ,trailers and pre-fabs that   
 have occupied the Quadrant.           </content>
