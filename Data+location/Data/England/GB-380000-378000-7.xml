		<title>07A COUNTRY LANE IN WILMSLOW</title>
		<content>{ Halmans Lane}is a dirt track through 
 grazing land leading to a wood.       
  The house down the lane was built    
 over 130 years old. It is owned by the
 Uttleys. {                            
  We questioned some{walkers in}the    
 lane. Mr.{Staniforth}told us that he  
 had been walking down the lane to     
 exercise his dog for 6 months. Mrs.   
{Bracegirdle }has enjoyed regular walks
 down the lane for 68 years.           
  There are many wild plants, brambles 
 being the most common. In our bird    
 survey we spotted  blackbirds, a      
 hawk, a cuckoo and a sparrow.There is 
 a lot of insect life, we  spotted some
 flies, water boatmen, a pond skater,  
 moths and butterflies.                
  People value the lane as it is and   
 would oppose any development that     
 threatened its recreational use.
