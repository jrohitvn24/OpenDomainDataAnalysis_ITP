		<title>16A Fruit Farm in Gnosall</title>
		<content>Just outside Gnosall there is a fruit  
farm where they grow strawberries and  
gooseberries.There are 60 acres of     
strawberries and 25 acres of           
gooseberries The strawberry plants     
are planted in October but this year   
they have planted new ones in August.  
The plants are watered by irrigation   
if the weather is dry,especially after 
planting,and are sprayed to get rid of 
the weeds and insects,also with pig    
manure.Slug pellets are put down.The   
strawberries  are  picked in the       
summer,startng in July.Between 200     
and 400 pickers come in cars,on        
bicycles,by bus or walk.{every day     
except Saturday}They start at 7a.m.    
and pick until 4p.m.The farmer clears  
the field,has his tea and loads the    
strawberries into refrigerated lorries.
They go all over the country,and       
abroad,as far as Sweden.               </content>
