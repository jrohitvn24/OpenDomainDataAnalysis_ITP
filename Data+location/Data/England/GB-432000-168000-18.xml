		<title>18Transport in Hungerford.</title>
		<content>   Hungerford has both a railway       
 station and a bus service although    
 there is no bus station.Thamesdown    
 operate a bus service from Hungerford 
 to Swindon once a day on Mondays,     
 Wednesdays and Fridays with a journey 
 time of 64 minutes.On Fridays,        
 Saturdays there is a new express      
 service linking Swindon,Marlborough,  
 Hungerford,Newbury and Reading with   
 journey times of 14 minutes to Swindon
 and 55 to Reading.                    
   On our survey people felt a regular 
 bus service to Newbury in particular  
 would be of benefit.As no buses run on
 Tuesdays or Thursdays anyone who lives
 in Hungerford without a car is        
 reliant upon the train service.British
 Rail run 13 trains per day through    
 Hungerford from Westbury in the west  
 to Newbury, with connections on to    
 Reading.                              </content>
