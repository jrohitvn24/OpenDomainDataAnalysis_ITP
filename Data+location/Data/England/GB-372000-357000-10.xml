		<title>10A day at school 1</title>
		<content>  The first job that Fiona did with her
 friend Suzanne was to read a poem in  
 class.The poem was called" If you     
 don't put your shoes on before I count
 15".Fiona had been sorted to write a  
 poem, then read a poem and write about
 it.She was doing her first poem about 
 sports day.She had to copy the        
 beginning of the sports day poem off  
 the board and then do the rest herself
   At 10. 45 it was play time she      
 played a ball game.You play it like   
 this.The person who is  on says "If   
 you have a brother." Then the person  
 throws the ball,and if you have a     
 brother you catch it,then you're on.At
 11.00am Fiona went to recorders with  
 her recorder group.They are going     
 to play "Annie's song".They went to   
 practice near the office.After they   
 had practiced they went back into the 
 hall.                                 </content>
