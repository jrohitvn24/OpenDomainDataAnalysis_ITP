		<content> Grace was said before the meal        
 commenced and at the end of the meal  
 pupils cleared the tables and asked   
 permission to leave the room.The      
 teachers were called Ma'am or Sir.    
   Pupils came from villages around the
 area e.g. Dunton, Arlesey and         
 Shefford, as well as from Bedford.    
 Today pupils still come in to school  
 by bus but only from the nearbye      
 villages.                             
   Stratton is now a mixed             
 comprehensive. Pupils start at the age
 of thirteen in what is called the     
 third year.Science subjects are taught
 separately;  there are also creative  
 lessons e.g. ceramics and metalwork.  
   The school uniform is grey and      
 blue,ties are worn by boys in the     
 winter months,caps and berets are no  
 longer worn.
