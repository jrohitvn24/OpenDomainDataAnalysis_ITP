		<content>  There is a Methodist Chapel          
 prominently situated near the centre  
 of the town while the Parish Church of
 St. Nicholas is reached from Wharf    
 Street. The tower of the church has a 
 castle-like turret and the upper part 
 is built of white stone but has no    
 bell.The building has an untidy       
 appearance and sections have been     
 added,with the use of different types 
 of stone very apparent.The surrounding
 graveyard is enclosed by iron railings
 and overgrown with candytuft. Some of 
 graves date back to the 18th.Century. 
  The Methodist Church has no graveyard
 and is surrounded by modern buildings.
 The Pinfold is to be found next to it.
 The church is an imposing building    
 with black irion railings. The stained
 glass is in the art nouveau style with
 pale green,pink,mauve and yellow panes
 in flower and leaf shapes.            </content>
