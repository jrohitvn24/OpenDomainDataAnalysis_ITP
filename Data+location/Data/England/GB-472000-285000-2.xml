 which are under crops.Nearby farms are

 Pilkington family,bought the farm in  
 1950 and 3 of the family work on it   
 with 1 full time helper and 3 members 
 of the Youth Training Scheme at       
 harvest time.The main crop is{winter  
{wheat}(112 acres) with 39 acres of{oil
{seed rape.}The remaining acreage is   
 taken up with{winter barley,potatoes, 
{strawberries,sweetcorn,}and over 4    
 acres of other{vegetables}in{rotation.
 Vegetables are sold at the farm but   
 the grain is sold to grain merchants  
 in Leicester.To increase farm sales   
 they plan to convert their garage into
 a farm shop.However,they have no plans
 to increase the farm acreage.         </content>
