		<title>19TRANSPORT ALONG THE A34</title>
		<content> Over the years transport has changed  
 Bradford Lane was cobbled so that the 
 horses pulling carts would not loose  
 their grip.Now we travel by car and on
 buses. There are 29 buses from        
 Macclesfield to Manchester and 27     
 buses from Manchester to Macclesfield 
 all going along the A34 every         
 weekday. There are two bus companys   
 operating the route:Crosvile which has
 green buses and Greater Manchester    
 Transport which has orange ones. Most 
 of the buses are double decker and you
 pay the driver. There are no speed    
 restrictions on the A34 and there is  
 no lollipop lady for the school which 
 makes crossing the road difficult. All
 the workers from ICI make the road    
 very busy particularly in the early   
 morning and again in the evening.
