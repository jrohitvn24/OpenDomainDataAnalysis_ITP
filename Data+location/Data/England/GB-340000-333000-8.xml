		<title>08The old Railway-Welshampton</title>
		<content> Cambrian railways built the railway   
 which used to run between Whitchurch, 
 Oswestry and Aberystwyth,some of the  
 railway line is still used today.The  
 line was built in approximately 1880. 
 It was used for passengers,freight and
 also to carry troops in the Second    
 World War.The old station is now a    
 house.The line was closed in 1966,a   
 man called Dr Beeching and the        
 Government closed it because it wasn't
 making enough money.The old sleepers  
 went for timber but some are still    
 there today.The rails went for        
 scrap.The line is now a haven for     
 wildlife.Birds nest there,there are   
 many species of wild flowers,but some 
 of it is used for rough grazing.It now
 looks much as it did when it was      
 a Roman road.There was a very serious 
 crash on the line in 1909 near        
 Welshampton station.                  </content>
