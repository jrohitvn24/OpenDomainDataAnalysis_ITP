		<title>16Minshull Vernon</title>
		<content> Minshull Vernon is a small hamlet rath
 er than a village.It has a long histor
 y,being mentioned in the original Dome
 sday Book whereas Warmingham is not.Ho
 wever,it is now much smaller than Warm
 ingham and lacks the unifying factors 
 such as a school,church or village hal
 l.The only centre for the people to   
 meet is the Verdin Arms,the local pub.
 There are three small firms operating 
 from the hamlet and a transport cafe  
 serving the traffic using the A530.The
 firms are fairly recent and the cafe  
 has only been open for a short time.Th
 e social life of the inhabitants is   
 conducted in the main outside the ham 
 let in Middlewich,Church Minshull and 
 Bradfield Green.
