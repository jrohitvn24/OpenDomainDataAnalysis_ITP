		<title>12TREKILLICK FARM</title>
		<content>   Trekillick farm is owned and farmed 
 by Mr. John Dyer and his son Colin.   
 The land covers a total of 126 acres  
 with another 35 acres of grassland    
 rented at Innis and 25 acres at       
 Dunmere.                              
   All crops grown are for feeding the 
 animals which consist of 87 cows and  
 149 bullocks.                         
   The farm was purchased in 1935.     
 Since that time, field enlargements   
 have taken place and in doing so a    
 local landmark has been destroyed.    
 There was, until a few years ago a    
 field on the side of the hill with a  
 strange shape. From the Lanivet side  
 it was called the Leg of Mutton field 
 and from Bodmin it was called the     
 "Chimney Pot".                        
   Also on the farm is an adit dating  
 back to the last century in the mining
 era.                                  </content>
