		<content> 'This is what we saw when we explored 
 the Stalybridge side of Hough Hill,   
 which is where our school is in       
 Dukinfield. There were some           
 semi-detached houses, and some three  
 and two storey blocks of flats. There 
 is a pub called 'The British          
 Protection'. It had a pub sign of a   
 soldier in a red coat with a rifle.   
 Just 2 streets away, there is a pub   
 with the name 'The Thirteenth Mounted 
 Cheshire Riflemen Inn.'There are two  
 Churches. St. Peters Roman Catholic   
 Church stands next to its own school  
 and nursery. On the by-pass, stands a 
 new church, The Methodist Church,     
 Stalybridge. The church us round in   
 design, and has a spire in the middle.
 Some children from our school have    
 been baptised here. Behind these      
 streets,is the grass of HoughHill.'
