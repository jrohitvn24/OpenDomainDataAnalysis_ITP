		<title>05SUNDAY AT PETTICOAT LANE</title>
		<content>{*}As Bradwell is such a small village 
 there are not many opportunities to   
 earn money during my spare time.I am  
 lucky as I have a part-time job in    
 London selling fur coats on Petticoat 
 Lane Market.It is my uncle's stall.We 
 drive to his house on Saturday night  
 to get an early start on Sunday       
 morning.He lives in Tilbury which is  
 about one-and-a-half hours from       
 Liverpool Street.We leave at six in   
 the morning and set up the stall ready
 for business by eight.                
{*}We sell mostly coney(rabbit) coats  
 in every colour imaginable.We also    
 sell fox,afghan,goat and dog.If we are
 asked we could supply mink,but they   
 are too valuable to bring with us     
 every week.
