		<title>14Local Sports and Pastimes 1</title>
		<content> The local sports tend to cater simply 
 for the resident village population   
 but there are several activities which
 are quite unique to this part of the  
 country.                              
 Although more in evidence at the      
 larger shows and events these         
 activities are:                       
 HOUND TRAILING                        
 FELL RUNNING                          
 CUMBERLAND AND WESTMORLAND WRESTLING  
                                       
 Being close to the Lake District      
 National Park means that there are    
 many facilities available for those   
 who enjoy all forms of outdoor        
 activities.                           
 In the area itself the residents can  
 also participate in various field     
 sports such as clay pigeon shooting.  
                                       
                                       </content>
