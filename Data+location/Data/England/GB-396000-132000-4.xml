{Public transport}serving Chilmark and 
 Teffont consists of a{limited bus     
 service. Six buses a day each way from
 Salisbury to Hindon,fewer on Saturday 
 and none on Sunday are augmented by a 
{special shopping bus}into Salisbury on
 market days, Tuesday and Saturday and 
 a bus to Tisbury on Friday paid for by
 Tisbury Traders. A trial service to   
 Warminster has been running on Friday.
 A late flexible bus runs from Salibury
 on weekdays.                          
 The nearest{railway station}is at     
 Tisbury, with trains to Waterloo and  
 Exeter. Few people use{bicycles;}most 
 use{private cars.}There is easy access
 to the A303 trunk road, 3 miles to the
 north. A network of{footpaths}and     
{bridlepaths}is evidence of how people 
 got around in the past.
