		<content> There is no resident policeman in the 
 area. Playford and Bealings are       
 looked after from Kesgrove, Rushmere  
 from Ipswich.  Crime is not a major   
 problem. Minor vandalism exists and   
 is bothesome but despite the many     
 large and isolated houses burglaries  
 and break-ins are not common. The     
 police say their relationship with the
 public in Suffolk as a whole is very  
 good. The local magistrates' court is 
 at Woodbridge, the Crown court at     
 Ipswich.  The preence of to U S Air   
 Force bases some miles away has led to
 several US servicemen and families    
 living here. providing quite a good   
 (taxed) income for home owners, with  
 no problem of re-occupation.  Heavy   
 and fast military aircraft overhad    
 seem to cause little disturance to    
 local people. Each village has its war
 memoial adjacent to the parish church.</content>
