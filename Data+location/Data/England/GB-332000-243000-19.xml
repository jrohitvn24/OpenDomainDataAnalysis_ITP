		<content> Built in the 1880's by a Manchester   
 businessman, Brobury House stands just
 above Bredwardine Bridge, commanding a
 magnificent view over the river to the
 Knapp. The present owner has opened an
 Art Gallery there and exhibits a fine 
 range of watercolours, etchings and   
 prints from the 16th Century onwards. 
 Visitors may enjoy the gardens which  
 extend to 9 acres.                    
 Moccas Court, in Moccas Estate, was   
 built in the 1770's to a design by    
 Robert and James Adam. It is open to  
 the public on Thursday afternoons in  
 the Summer and features several fine  
 rooms, including a circular Dining    
 Room and an oval Hall with a          
 cantilevered staircase. There is some 
 good Georgian and Louis XV furniture ,
 and also paintings of members of the  
 Cornewall family. The once-neglected  
 gardens are being restored.           </content>
