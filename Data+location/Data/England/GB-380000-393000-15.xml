		<content> A television survey revealed that most
 people prefer soap operas. Dallas came
 top but Coronation Street was a close 
 second because it is so true to life  
 and related to the Stretford area.    
 Comedy programmes were also popular.  
 The favourite radio station in the    
 area is piccadilly, which shows that  
 people are interested in what is going
 on locally. Young people liked        
 Piccadilly, older people preferred    
 Radios 4 and 2. Many people wanted    
 fewer news programmes and             
 documentaries. Nearly everyone said   
 that they would not pay extra for     
 cable TV.                             
 Breakfast television is popular. Most 
 people preferred ITV to BBC because of
 the commercials. It was felt that the 
 BBC should take commercials.
