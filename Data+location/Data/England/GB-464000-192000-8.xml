		<title>08Life in Britwell</title>
		<content> Mrs Carrington told us about living in
 Britwell today.  She said Britwell was
 a friendly community.  There is not   
 much transport.  A coach which costs  
 50p return goes to Watlington every   
 Friay.  The nearest shops, chemists,  
 vets, doctors are in Watlinton and    
 people in the village especially old  
 people rely a lot on friends and      
 neighbours.  One of the advantages of 
 living in the village is that there is
 lots of entertainment, barn dances,   
 pig roasts, Harvest supper, chuch     
 fete, firewoks on bonfire night,      
 swimming.  There is a youth club and  
 cricket club.  As there is not much   
 traffic the village is quiet and      
 pictuesque.  Most jobs today are in   
 farming or housekeeping.  The childen 
 go to school in Watlington.  The      
 nearest playgroup is in Watlington    
 too.  Britwell not changed in 20 years</content>
