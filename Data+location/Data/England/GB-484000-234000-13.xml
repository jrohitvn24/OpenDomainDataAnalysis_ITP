		<title>13Employment in Bletchley</title>
		<content>   A lot of people live in Bletchley   
 and most of them work in the town.A   
 lot of the others work in nearby      
 Milton Keynes.Some people have to     
 travel to work by train because their 
 jobs are in London.                   
   Most people travel to work by car,  
 and it usually takes them             
 approximately ten minutes or less.    
 Other people travel to work by bus or 
 bike,or if they have not got any of   
 these they walk.                      
   On average,two people from each     
 household go to work.Many people have 
 had more than one job since they have 
 been living in Bletchley.Nearly       
 everyone said they enjoyed doing the  
 work they do.                         
   All in all,I think that Bletchley,  
 with its fun and excitement,its people
 and their work,is a safe and secure   
 and a good place to live.             </content>
