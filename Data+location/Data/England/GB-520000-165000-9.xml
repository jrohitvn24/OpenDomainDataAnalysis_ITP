		<content>MOST OF THE SCHOOLS IN OUR AREA ARE RUN
BY KINGSTON BOROUGH EDUCATION AUTHORITY
WHICH,UNLIKE MANY OTHER LOCAL COUNCILS,
HAS RETAINED THE 11+ EXAMINATION.THIS  
MEANS THAT OUR SECONDARY SCHOOLS ARE   
STILL SELECTIVE.IF CHILDREN PASS THE   
11+ EXAMINATION THEY WILL GO TO EITHER 
TIFFIN BOYS OR TIFFIN GIRLS GRAMMAR    
SCHOOL;IF NOT THEY WILL GO TO ONE OF   
THE SECONDARY MODERN SCHOOLS IN THE    
AREA.SOME OF THESE ARE SINGLE SEX      
SCHOOLS LIKE TOLWORTH GIRLS,COOMBE     
GIRLS OR BEVERLEY BOYS.OTHERS ARE MIXED
(CO-EDUCATIONAL)LIKE HOLLYFIELD OR     
FLEETWOOD.                             
ONE SECONDARY SCHOOL IN THE KINGSTON   
AREA IS DUE TO CLOSE BEFORE THE END OF 
THE EIGHTIES.THIS IS BECAUSE OF        
GOVERNMENT SPENDING CUTS ON EDUCATION  
AND A DECLINE IN THE SCHOOL POPULATION.
