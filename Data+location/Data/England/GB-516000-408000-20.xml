		<title>20SURVEYING AROUND KEELBY</title>
		<content> On Wednesday 19th of June a group of  
 us set off in Mrs Stowe's car out of  
 Keelby towards Grimsby.We stopped in a
 layby where there was a caravan.The   
 fields around us were used for crops. 
 We were in square eleven on the map.  
  We turned left at Riby crossroads,the
 fields were still used for crops.At   
 Oak Holt we found a packing station   
 hidden by trees.                      
  We turned right at the first junction
 and had a walk.We found a nest hidden 
 in a hedge.The fields towards Healing 
 Wells were used for crops.At Healing  
 Wells we found a farm where we turned 
 round to come back.                   
  At Riby crossroads we saw a surveyor 
 who was planing out a new crossroads  
 because the old one was too dangerous.
  On the way back we saw alsorts of    
 birds.We had covered most of square   
 eleven and some of ten and twelve.    </content>
