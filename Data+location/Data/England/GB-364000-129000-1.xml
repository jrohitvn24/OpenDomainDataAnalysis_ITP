		<title>01A FARM AREA IN S.E. SOMERSET</title>
		<content> This area is mainly dairy farming of  
 which Fresian cattle are the          
 predominant milking cow with one herd 
 of Ayrshires. It is mostly grassland  
 which is either intensively farmed to 
 cut twice or three times for silage or
 hay and grazed by cattle. Other crops 
 such as fodder beet, maize, turnips   
 are grown for animal feed. Cereals are
 also grown mostly for animal feed.    
 Beef and sheep are also kept on a     
 smaller scale. There is no industry in
 this area. Hadspen House Gardens are  
 open to the public and are being      
 restored to their former glory. They  
 also have a garden centre. The area   
 is lightly populated, most inhabitants
 in the three villages, Yarlington,    
 Bratton Seymour and Shepton Montague.
