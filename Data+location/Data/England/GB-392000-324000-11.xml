		<title>11 My visit to the R.A.F.</title>
		<content>                                       
     Saturday 30th June 1985.          
On Saturday I went to Stafford         
R.A.F.open day. It was 25p to get in.  
It was lovely and sunny which made     
the day really good.  I went with my   
sister. Before we went  we saw the Red 
Arrows fly  really low overhead.       
    At the R.A.F. it was  packed with  
people.There was a  Noddy Train and a  
fire engine which you could have a     
ride on, some pony rides and a  car    
boot sale.  They even had a kiddies    
corner which the children could play   
in.                                    
    I had a go with a  mine detector.  
The man put some ear phones on me which
fell over my eyes but he put them back 
on .I found the mine . The man said if 
you trod on it, it would blow up but it
was disconnected .
