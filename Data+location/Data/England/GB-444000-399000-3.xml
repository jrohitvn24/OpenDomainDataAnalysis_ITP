		<content> FRIDAY JULY 5th - MEXBOROUGH          
 The old maternity ward at Mexborough  
 montagu Hospital has undergone an     
 extensive face-lift and is now        
 re-opened as a dual mixed medical     
 ward.                                 
      The first sector, named Dearne,  
 opened a month ago with 25 beds.      
      Last week Cadeby sector took in  
 its first batch of 10 patients in a 23
 bed ward.                             
      It's all part of a Â£3.5 million  
 development being carried out at the  
 Hospital over the next three years.   
      Maternity shut at Christmas, and 
 mothers-to-be now go to District      
 General Hospitals in the area.
