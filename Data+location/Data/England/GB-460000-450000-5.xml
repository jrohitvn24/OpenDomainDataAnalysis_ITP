 WALMGATE BAR AND THE SIEGE OF YORK.   
 In the 17th Century Parliament decided
 to overthrow King Charles 1st.Charles 
 called his side Royalists.Parliaments 
 side were called Roundheads.In 1642   
 The Civil War began.The Roundheads    
 battered the walls with cannons and   
 set explosives.But only one went off  
 destroying St Marys Tower.Finally the 
 Roundheads hoisted their cannons to   
 the top of St Lawrence's Church       
 because on the ground their cannons   
 could not break in.The cannons caused 
 damage to the houses in between and   
 some damage to the walls but they     
 could'nt break them down.Finally the  
 Roundheads withdrew to Marston Moor_  
 only to meet more Royalists.4,000     
 Royalists died and they surrendered.  
 Today you can tell where the walls    
 were damaged.                         </content>
