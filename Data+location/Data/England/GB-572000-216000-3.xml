		<content> Since June 1981 the children of the   
 area have had a smart new building to 
 work in.Before that they were taught  
 in a school that had been used since  
 May 28th 1877.The new building is     
 modern with 5 classrooms built around 
 a large hall which is used for drama  
 P.E., games,assembly and dinner.The   
 cloakrooms are off each classroom and 
 there are toilets and washbasins there
 too.                                  
 The old building had 5 classrooms, 2  
 were portable buildings built by the  
 side of the playground. The children  
 had to go outside to the toilets at   
 the bottom of the playing field.      
 Assembly was held in a classroom      
 because there was no hall. P.E. had to
 be done in the classrooms too. Now the
 old school is falling into disrepair. 
 The windows are broken and the        
 playground is overgrown with weeds.   </content>
