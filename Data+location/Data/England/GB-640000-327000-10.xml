 soap powder,with a beating action by  
 paddles gets the washing clean. It is 
 removed to the second compartment     
 where a fast revolving movement will  
 rinse and spin out the excess water.

 drum into which the dirty washing is  
 placed, programmed according to type  
 of wash, wool, linen, cotton, or nylon
 will then wash rinse an spin damp dry.

 method commonly used. A spin dryer    
 will rinse and spin dry only.

 washing machine is hung outside on a  
 line to dry.
