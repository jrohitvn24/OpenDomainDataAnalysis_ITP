		<title>03Kimbolton - Trade</title>
		<content>    Trade has always been concentrated 
 within 200 metres of the old market-  
 -place :                              
    Until recently there were about a  
 score of the usual trade outlets :    
 concern was expressed about the       
 closure of a grocer's shop and a      
 general shop - bowing to the          
 competition of the cheaper, easily    
 accessible, nationwide chains.        
    However,within the last five years,
 the number of shops has grown by 50%. 
 Many of these are 'lock-up' shops     
 erected in a speculative manner within
 old-alleyways and inn-yards- by nature
 transitory, but at least suggesting   
 promise for the future.               
  The attraction is two-fold. A growing
 and reasonably prosperous population  
 living in a setting that includes     
 stylish shops and increasingly        
 draws the tourist and casual shopper. </content>
