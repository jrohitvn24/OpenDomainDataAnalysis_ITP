		<title>09Farming in Long Marton</title>
		<content> Farming is mostly mixed farming,cattle
 for milk and beef,sheep for wool and  
 meat,crops such as barley and wheat   
 and root crops like potatoes and turn-
 ips.                                  
    The nearest farm to the school is  
 Midtown Farm,owned by the Bellas fam- 
 ily.There have been Bellas's in Long  
 Marton since the family came over with
 William the Conqueror and settled land
 in this area.                         
    Some farmers use the old oblong    
 bales for hay and put their silage in-
 to pits,but more and more farmers are 
 using the round bale method for hay   
 and silage.                           
    A round bailer twists the hay or   
 silage into a huge cylinder shape.An- 
 other machine with a spike pick it up 
 and two men put a plastic bag over the
 bale.The neck is tied with bailer     
 twine and the bales are then stored.  </content>
