		<title>17DENWICK (PETER'S) MILL</title>
		<content>{Denwick Mill,}was established about { 
{1680}as a{fulling mill.}This was a    
 process for the cleaning of raw wool  
 and the mill continued to be used for 
 this purpose for 159 years.In{1848    
{Peter Eadington}changed the use of the
 mill to{corn grinding.}From then on   
 the mill has been known as{Peter's    
{Mill.}He got the grindstones from     
 Billy Mill,Chirton,South  Shields and 
 one of these is now embedded in a wall
 of{Waterside House Farm.}In 1897 the  
 tenancy passed to Anne and Mary       
 Eadington and early this century the  
 mill ceased to function. Mary died    
 during the 1st World war and in 1926  
 Sir Francis Walker ordered Brannigan  
 to remove the mill and the house.The  
 area is still known as Peter's Mill   
 and is a{favourite spot for local     
{people to go walking.Stepping stones  
{have replaced an earlier bridge.      </content>
