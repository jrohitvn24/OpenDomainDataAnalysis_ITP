		<content> The area of this survey lies mainly on
 a southern slope, bordered on the east
 by cliffs overlooking Cayton Bay and  
 the North Sea, and encroaching onto   
 the drained Carr flatlands of the Vale
 of Pickering to the south. About 50%  
 of the area is given over to arable   
 farming, 16% to three post war urban  
 developments, 25% is sea and the      
 remaining 9% being ribbon development,
 industry, sand and boulder clay       
 cliffs. Running from NW to SE along   
 the coast is the A165 from Scarborough
 to Filey, with its ribbon pre war     
 housing and 1960's private housing    
 estates on the southern boundary of   
 Scarborough. In the area is the 1950's
 Scarborough Council / private housing 
 estate of Eastfield with its late     
 1960's industrial development, and the
 Saxon village of Cayton and Osgodby   
 with their post war development.      </content>
