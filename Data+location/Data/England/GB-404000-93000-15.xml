		<content> We are now in Bourne Bottom, a very   
 contraversial area at the moment. This
 is the valley through which the Bourne
 Stream runs. Plans to run a ring road 
 through this area are being challenged
 by local residents and conservation   
 groups. This is understandable as it  
 is a beautiful piece of countryside   
 right in the middle of a highly       
 populated area. We saw a group of     
 magpies nesting close to the Stream.  
 Whilst in the Stream minnows darted to
 and fro. We wondered what else might  
 be lurking in the undergrowth. Walking
 up the other side of the valley we    
 come to a large, mainly council       
 estate, known as Rossmore. As we      
 walked on we were reminded of a rabbit
 warren because there were so many     
 little cul-de-sacs. We walked for     
 almost an hour without seeing a shop.
