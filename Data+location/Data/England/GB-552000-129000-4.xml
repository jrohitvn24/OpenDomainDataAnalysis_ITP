		<content> We visited 3 Primary schools and one  
 playgroup with some great differences 
 but also some amazing similarities.   
 Approx. 4000 children go to school in 
 the Crowboro' area. Jarvis Brook has  
 337 children aged between 4_11. There 
 are 13 full &amp; 4 part_time teachers who
 teach a wide range of subjects includ_
 ing cookery. Rotherfield was a small  
 school with only 148 pupils with 6    
 full &amp; 3 part_time teachers. However  
 they have 3 computers and an outdoor  
 swimming pool. Fermor the largest and 
 oldest school, opened in 1744 with    
 money left in Sir Henry Fermor's will,
 has 450 pupils. All Saints playgroup, 
 opened in 1969, has 60 children aged 2
 _5, 30 attending each morning. They   
 are taught simple lessons &amp; also play.
 We discovered that the larger schools 
 often had less facilities than smaller
 schools. Why is this so?              </content>
