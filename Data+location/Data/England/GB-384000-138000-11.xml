		<title>11Dairy Farm 2:The Deverills</title>
		<content> A typical day at{Mill Farm}begins with
 milking at 7.OOam, then the calves are
 fed. In the summer-time, the cows are 
 put out to grass on strips controlled 
 by an electric fence. In winter time, 
 the cows are fed silage or hay indoors
 and manure is hauled out,then the     
 farmer works his fields. Lunch is     
 always at one o' clock. At 4.00 pm    
 it is milking time again and the      
 calves are fed. Tea is at 5.45pm, then
 when silage-making or hay-making work 
 continues as long as there is light.  
 The farm is worked by the farmer and  
 his wife and son. Work on the farm has
 changed, it is far more mechanised.   
  The first tractor was introduced onto
 the farm in 194O. Now the farmer has 2
 tractors,a dung spreader, 2 ploughs, a
 silage trailer, a mower and hay maker.
 He has a herring-bone milking parlour 
 and a bulk milk tank instead of churns</content>
