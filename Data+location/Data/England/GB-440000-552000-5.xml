		<content>   When we asked people about their    
 favourite{games}we found that there   
 were a lot of games which people      
 liked. We decided to write a small    
 amount about the two most popular     
 games:{Marbles and British Bulldog.}  
   In the game of marbles 2 people play
 against each other. The object of the 
 game is to win the opponent's marble. 
 If the opponent's marble is ordinary  
 you only have to hit it once. If,     
 however, their marble is much better  
 than yours then you would have to hit 
 it several times to win the game.     
   A popular game with the boys is     
{British Bulldog.}A number of people   
 are needed. The object of the game is 
 to get from one end of the court to   
 the other. One person will try to stop
 you. If you are caught then you will  
 help him to catch the others. The last
 person caught is the winner.          </content>
