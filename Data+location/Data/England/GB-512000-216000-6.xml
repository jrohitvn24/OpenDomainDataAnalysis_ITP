		<content> My name is{Victoria Dulieu}and my     
 family and{I live on a smallholding.  
 It is called{Bower Heath farm}and is  
 in Harpenden,{Hertfordshire.}We raise 
 cattle keep{Shire Horses, goats, sheep
{and some chickens.}We also have{four  
{dogs, five cats and a rabbit}on our 25
 acres. We raise the cattle for beef,  
 and we show the Shire Horses as well  
 as breed from them.{The goat is milked
{twice a day}for our own supply of milk
 and she usually gives about{5 pints.  
{The chickens are fed once a day}and we
 collect their eggs which are often    
 still warm.{We pump our own water out 
{of the ground}with an electric pump;  
 each and every day it is pumped for   
 our own use and for the animals in the
 fields.
