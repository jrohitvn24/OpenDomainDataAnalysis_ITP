		<content> The means of transport are bus, cars, 
 bicycles and walking. The majority of 
 the younger children use the bus      
 whereas the older children use more   
 varied methods. Bicycling is only     
 allowed for children in class 3 and   
 the school runs with R.O.S.P.A. the   
 National Cycling Proficiency Test. The
 bus leaves Alderbury at 8.30..p.m.    
 and arrives at 8.40.a.m. In the       
 afternoon it leaves school soon after 
 3.00.p.m. On Tuesdays the children go 
 swimming and are drooped off at       
 Alderbury on the way back. On         
 Wednesdays it leaves school at 3.45.  
 so there are clubs. 38 children use   
 the bus, 7 children are brought in the
 carsand another 7 children use them   
 when it is raining.13 children walk to
 school and 5 regularly ride their     
 bicycles.
