		<content> Our visitor the old us of today.      
 Now though I wouldn't like to be      
 without all the modern comforts I have
 got used to.We have a                 
 washing-machine,a vacuum cleaner, a   
 television and a small car. What I    
 especially like is our modern bathroom
 with its constant hot water and a     
 shower.                               
 What I miss most are the small shops  
 where you could be served by an       
 assistant and where you could buy     
 small amounts of things.              
 I notice the prices! The bus journey  
 I often take now costs 68p. When I was
 a girl it was two old pence.          
 I also notice how much more it takes  
 to make people happy.They aren't so   
 easily content--children aren't happy 
 unless they have lots of expensive    
 toys.                                 
                                       </content>
