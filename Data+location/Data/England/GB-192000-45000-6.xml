		<title>06The River Fal: Background</title>
		<content>   In our D_block the River Fal flows  
 SSW from Tregony to Grampound.This    
 page deals with the river's historical
 significance and the next page with   
 its morphology.Next to Creed Church   
 there was said to be a place called   
 Hallbote where boats were tied        
 up.Tregony used to be a thriving      
 port.Part of the Fal is now silted up 
 due to the tinners' tin-streaming     
 activities and waste flowing          
 downriver.This part of the Fal flows  
 through Trewithen Estate;whose        
 ownership has passed down through a   
 single family for many generations.   
   Golden mill used to provide grain   
 for Golden Manor in the 17th century  
 but it has fallen into disuse.        
   The hill fort shown on the O.S.     
 map(924468) is of either Roman or Iron
 Age origin.
