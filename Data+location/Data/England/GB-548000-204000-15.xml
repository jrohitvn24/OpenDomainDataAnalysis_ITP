		<title>15Ashlyns Farm</title>
		<content> Ashlyns form grows wheat, barley,     
 potatoes and oil seed rape. The crops 
 are sent to the common market         
 countries. They own 290 acres and 2   
 people work on the farm. It was first 
 owned by Richard Ascelyn. He worked   
 there 600 years ago. The Royal college
 of Physicians owned it from 1672-1922.
 It is now owned by Mr Collins. They   
 havent got much machinery now. They   
 have got 4 ploughs and 1 potato bed   
 fall which digs up the earth in lines 
 so that potatoes can be planted. Also 
 1 potatoe harvester. They put their   
 crops in the barn to dry. Behind the  
 farm house there are the remains of a 
 moat which went round a manor house.  
 It is a shallow pebbly stream         
 overgrown with nettles, docks and long
 grass.
