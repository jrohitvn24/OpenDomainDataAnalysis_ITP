		<title>16Transport Bolton by Bowland</title>
		<content>  Transport is a problem in this area  
 unless people have their own cars.    
  There is a bus service to Clitheroe  
 on Tuesdays and Thursdays. This is a  
 small single-decker bus called        
{'Betty's Bus'}which takes shoppers to 
 the market in the morning and back    
 early in the afternoon.On Wednesday it
 is possible to go to Nelson and       
 Burnley via Gisburn.To connect with   
 any other bus service means a 3 mile  
 walk to Sawley or Grindleton,which    
 have more frequent services.Children  
 go by special coaches to secondary    
 schools in Clitheroe,Grindleton and   
 even as far as Blackburn.             
  Shopping,visiting the doctors or     
 dentists,going to the Cinema or       
 Swimming Baths and just travelling to 
 school or work,takes a lot of time and
 organisation for families.
