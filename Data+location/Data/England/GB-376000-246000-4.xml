		<title>04MALVERN THEATRE</title>
		<content> The Malvern Festival Theatre was      
 opened on July 1st,  1885 as the      
 Great Hall of the Malvern Assembly    
 Rooms.It started off as the Malvern   
 Assembly Rooms and Pleasure Gardens in
 which a company was incorparated      
 in 1883.The main hall is now the      
 theatre.The council bought the        
 theatre.They lifted the floor with    
 extra bricks to let the people see    
 everything,and they built a false     
 ceiling.They added a projection room  
 which was to control the sound and the
 lighting.They built the circle,which  
 has 350 seats.The stalls have 450     
 seats.There used to be 960 seats,but  
 the council widened all the rows so   
 that the audience would be more       
 comfortable.There is an orchestral pit
 to take 26 musicians. Backstage there 
 are 8 dressing-rooms.
