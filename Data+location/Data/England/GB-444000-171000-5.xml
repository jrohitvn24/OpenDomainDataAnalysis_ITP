		<content> One full time warden employed by      
 Newbury District Council and three    
 other wardens keep public order and   
 prevent fires in summer and carry out 
 general maintenance in winter.        
 The majority of people who use        
 Snelsmore common are the people       
 walking dogs,families picnicking and  
 school parties.There are grassy areas 
 with benches and tables to encourage  
 people to stay near the car parks and 
 leave the rest of the common for      
 walkers and wildlife enthusiasts.Some 
 branches are snapped off trees but    
 very little damage occures.Riding     
 schools are discouraged although there
 are bridleways.There are adders on    
 the common and as they are more likely
 to bite dogs than humans,anyone who is
 bitten must go to the vet to obtain   
 serum!Conservation was the aim of the 
 park but recreation is now important. </content>
