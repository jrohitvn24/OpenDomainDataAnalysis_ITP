		<content> There is a bus service following a    
 route which  crosses two corners of   
 the area. The service operates three  
 or four buses a day to Cambridge and  
 Haverhill with connections to         
 Newmarket. In addition there are      
 school buses twice a day .            
  One obvious sign of life in the      
 eighties is helicopter flight over the
 farms. There is traffic to and from   
 Newmarket and the Marshall Airport in 
 Cambridge. A few landowners use planes
 for crop spraying. Racehorse owners   
 and jockeys fly into the races at     
 Newmarket.                            
  The U.S. Air Force (which is based   
 north, at Mildenhall and Lakenheath)  
 fly training craft very low over this 
 part of the country.
