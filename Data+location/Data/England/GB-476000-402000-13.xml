    I get up at seven o'clock every    
 morning because my dad's alarm        
 clock wakes me up.At around eight     
 o'clock when I'm ready for school I   
 take my dog for a walk.Then at twenty 
 to nine I set off to bike to school.  
 It's about 1 mile from my house to    
 school because I live on the outskirts
 of Epworth.I go through the village   
 centre because it's not too busy in a 
 morning.At 1st break in a morning     
 there is a tuck shop where you can buy
 sweets and crisps.We finish school at 
 a quarter to four and I get home at   
 four o'clock and take Digger for      
 another walk.Sometimes I will go and  
 play with my friends and sometimes I  
 go and meet my dad at the farm where  
 he works.Finally I go to bed at around
 nine o'clock.
