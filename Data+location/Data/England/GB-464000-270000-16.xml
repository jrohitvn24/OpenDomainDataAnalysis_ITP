		<title>16Coton Village.</title>
		<content>Coton is a very small village,known as 
a settlement,of about 6O people.It lies
in a sheltered Northamptonshire valley.
The most imposing house is Coton Manor,
surrounded by beautiful gardens.A few  
cottages are made of mud and thatched  
but the rest are under lOO years old.  
There is no shop or public house and   
the only bus through the village is a  
SundayÂ£Saunterbus'.The residents vary  
greatly-a retired commander-a builder, 
an author,several bankers,a perfumer   
and a retired champion show jumper.The 
locals are friendly and helpful to each
other but don't like any sort of change
They are wary of new families who move 
into the village until they get to know
them.It is bleak in winter but beauti- 
ful in Spring with many birds and wild 
flowers.The only real nusiance is when 
the airforce jets fly overhead at      
terrific speed,quite low and very noisy</content>
