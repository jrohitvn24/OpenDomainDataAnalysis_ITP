		<title>12COMPLEX FOR THE HANDICAPPED.</title>
		<content> WALTHAM LODGE  is for handicapped     
 people. It's built by John Groomes    
 Housing Association and stands on the 
 corner of Park Road and Goldsmith     
 Road Leyton E10.Inside everything is  
 on a low level so that people in      
 wheelchairs can reach.There are levers
 for the taps and windows to make them 
 easy to turn or open,and even the     
 cooker is on a low level. Most things 
 in the kitchen have gaps underneath so
 that people in wheelchairs can get    
 close enough to work.In the bathroom  
 by the toilet there is a wide gap so  
 that they can slide out of their      
 wheelchair and onto the toilet.Again  
 there are 2 levers for the taps.In    
 every room there is an orange lever so
 that if the person falls over or has  
 an accident they can pull the lever   
 and someone will come to help them.
