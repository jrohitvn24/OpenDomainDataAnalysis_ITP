		<content> We surveyed the A616 Huddersfield to  
 Sheffield road which follows the line 
 of the old turnpike road.(There is    
 still an old toll house near Victoria 
 called Gatehead Barhouse(176058).)It  
 is used by many vehicles, 136 an hour 
 between 11am and noon, including 22   
 lorries carrying clay pipes(from      
 Hepworth Iron Company), steel, cattle,
 sheep, beer, fish and yarn. There are 
 lanes, greenways, bridlepaths and     
 footpaths criss-crossing the main road
 which provide ways for local people.  
 The many greenways, wide tracks       
 between two walls, were once the main 
 thoroughfares. Footpaths cross the    
 countryside with many types of stile  
 built into the dry stone walls. New   
 stiles tend to be wood especially     
 where walls have decayed. Some of the 
 paths were paved by the mill owners   
 and remain in part(162077)(161071).   </content>
