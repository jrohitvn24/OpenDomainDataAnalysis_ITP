		<content> Towards the coast the land is         
 uncultivated with sand dunes and rocky
 cliffs.In some places the rocks       
 stretch out to sea and at low tide    
 many rock pools can be seen.Fossils   
 and sea coal can be found in and near 
 the rocky cliffs. There is the remains
 of an old{lime kiln }near the beach.  
   The beach is sandy and the road to  
 it crosses the main railway line near 
 the old station which is now closed,  
 although the old station house is     
 occupied.                             
   In the rock pools many small fish,  
 crabs and starfish can be seen and on 
 the side of the rocks you can find    
{limpets,barnacles,whelks}and{winkles. 
 Often after a very rough sea there is 
 a lot of seaweed left on the beach and
 this is mainly bladderwrack.Just off  
 the coast{seals}can be seen swimming  
 in the sea.                           </content>
