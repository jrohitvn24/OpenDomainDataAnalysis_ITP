		<content> The principal river of the area is the
{River Wid}which flows roughly from    
 south-west to north-east. It is not a 
 large river - usually no more than a  
 metre or so deep but it does form a   
 natural boundary in the area. There is
 only one small, narrow road bridge    
 across the river - near the sewage    
 works to the south of Ingatestone. The
 river is in its middle course and     
 meanders across the gently undulating 
 countryside. The valley is gently     
 sloping and there is little evidence  
 of the development of any substantial 
 flood plain. Near the sewage works    
 there is a small area of water meadow 
 where horses are grazed; this rough   
 pasture provides a contrast with the  
 intensively used farmland elsewhere. A
 number of small tributaries flow into 
 the River Wid.
