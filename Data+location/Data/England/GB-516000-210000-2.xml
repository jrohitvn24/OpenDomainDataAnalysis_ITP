		<title>02Domesday entry,Sandridge</title>
		<content> The village was called Sandridge,     
 because it was built on a ridge of    
 sand.                                 
 Sandridge was very small in 1086,     
 the year that the Domesday Book       
 was compiled.Sandridge was entered in 
 the book as:26 peasants or villagers, 
 10 ploughs,2 cottagers,1 slave,       
 Woodland for 300 pigs.Its total value 
 was Â£18.00.                           
 Compare that to what it is like now:  
 population of just over 2000.It has   
 a garage,post office,3 public houses, 
 a local store,2 churches,village hall,
 cub hut,mobile library and a school.  
 You can see how much Sandridge has    
 changed in 900 years.
