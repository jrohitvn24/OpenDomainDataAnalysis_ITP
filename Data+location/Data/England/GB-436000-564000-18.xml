		<content> This worldwide organisation has its   
 foundations dating back to 1900. It is
 a christian based inter-denominational
 body which aims at encouraging girls, 
 aged 5 to 18, to physical,mental and  
 spiritual maturity.                   
  In the Tyne-Wear region there are 20 
 companies each attached to a church.  
 Company meetings are held weekly with 
 a programme based on badge work. Older
 girls participate in the Duke of      
 Edinburgh Award Scheme to encourage   
 service in the wider community.       
  Throughout the year there are various
 divisional events e.g. parades,       
 sports, barbecues. Each summer about  
 100 girls and officers attend a canvas
 camp. Within the area there are three 
 bugle and drum corps all of which have
 had success in national competition.In
 1985 a massed north-east band played  
 at the Royal Albert Hall London.      </content>
