		<title>14I.O.W. RUGBY CLUB, WOOTTON</title>
		<content>                                       
  This successful club was formed at   
 Ryde in 1924 by a group of 20 keen    
 sportsmen who played matches against  
 mainland opposition. The club moved to
 Wootton in 1969 and is now affiliated 
 to the Hampshire Rugby Union. The     
 clubhouse built by members was opened 
 in 1971 and has a thriving bar,       
 providing excellent facilities for    
 discos, buffets and other social      
 functions.                            
  Last season there were 87 playing    
 members in the club, drawn from all   
 walks of life plus a number of        
 non-playing members and colts. Annual 
 subscriptions are Â£17.50 for adults,  
 half for colts and a regular match fee
 of Â£1.60 is collected after each game.
  The club now plays friendlies and    
 matches in the Hampshire Senior Merit 
 Table.                                </content>
