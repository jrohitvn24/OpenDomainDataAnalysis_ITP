		<content>{ LAND OWNERSHIP}Large investments     
 since 1950 by Boots Chemist &amp; other   
 Company Pension Funds. Land then let. 
 Most farms owner-occupied.            
 Amalgamation of farms not uncommon.   
{ LAND PRICES 1985}Price per acre for  
 prime farm land has fallen from Â£2000 
 to Â£1800 due to falling returns as EEC
 reduces grain prices after vast       
 surplus harvest of 1984. Bank loans on
 land at 15% interest.                 
{ SIZE OF FARMS }Average over 500      
 acres. Few smaller. Decline of small  
 farms due to purchase of land by big  
 companies plus economies of large     
 scale farming. Mechanization important
 in area. Disappearance of farmhouses  
 as small farms are absorbed. Makes    
 redivision of farmland into smaller   
 units more difficult. Few young       
 farmers can buy farms.
