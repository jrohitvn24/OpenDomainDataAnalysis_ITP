		<content> Organised leisure is poorly provided  
 for the younger people of this area.  
 Apart from a{playgroup}for the        
 pre-school age group and local{horse  
{riding stable,}there is little else   
 for the{U18}age group, except for     
 their own hobbies and interests. There
 are two traditional{public houses     
 located in{Stanford Dingley,}whose    
 clientele come from considerable      
 distances especially in the summer.   
 The small public house at{Tutt's Clump
 is mainly used by locals. There is    
 only one{restaurant}in the area, found
 in Stanford Dingley, which provides   
 set meals ( a table must be booked in 
 advance ), and customers are invited  
 to bring their own drink to have with 
 the meal. The restaurant is open daily
 for cream teas between April and      
 September.                            
                                       </content>
