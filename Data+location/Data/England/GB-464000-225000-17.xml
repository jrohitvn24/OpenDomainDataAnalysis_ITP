		<title>17Twyford Local History</title>
		<content> Twyford is recorded in the Domesday   
 Book.Twyford Church has 2 interesting 
 Norman features i.e. a doorway and the
 chancel arch.The last family,the      
 Wenmans,to hold the Manor of Twyford  
 in the mid 1800's have a memorial in  
 the church.                           
                                       
 The oldest house in the village is    
 St.Mary's House situated at the rear  
 of the church.It dates from the 15th  
 century and was originally an open    
 hall house-the roof timbers are still 
 coated with tar from the open fires.  
 It has seen much alteration but still 
 retains much of its original wooden   
 structure.There are a few 17th century
 houses plus a pub.The present Village 
 Hall was built in 1930.The            
 Congregational Chapel was built on the
 site of the village pound in 1897 at a
 cost of 400,next to the old chapel.  </content>
