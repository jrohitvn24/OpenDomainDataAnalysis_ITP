		<title>01Halesworth Introduction.</title>
		<content>This section centres on the town of    
Halesworth ,in Suffolk ,which has a    
population of 4000. The section is     
mainly agricultural, whith barley,rape 
seed and wheat as the dominant crops   
and turkeys,chickens and pigs the main 
livestock.                             
Halesworth has a predominantly elderly 
population with school rolls at present
falling.                               
The business section is focussed on The
Thoroughfare which is the main road    
through town.There are two small       
industrial areas,one to the North and  
one to the South of Halesworth.        
The main sources of employment are     
Matthews turkey unit at Holton,retail  
buinesses,garages,estate agents and    
banks.                                 
The attraction of Halesworth is its    
lovely rural setting,but its heavy     
through traffic is a major drawback.   </content>
