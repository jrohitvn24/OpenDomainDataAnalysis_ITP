		<content>     The Nature Reserve was{established
{in 1965.}It extends north east to the 
 River rother and west to the River    
 Brede and Winchelsea Beach.Its        
 southern boundary is the sea.         
{  }It covers an{area of 1792 acres.}  
 There is an information centre at Rye 
 Harbour.Quite a lot of the area is{   
{water and gravel pits.}The reserve    
 covers{shingle ridges,}a large area of
{grazing land}around Camber Castle and 
 some {salt marsh}on the west bank of  
 the River Rother between Rye Harbour  
 and the river mouth.                  
   {The Friends of Rye Harbour Nature  
{Reserve}was formed{in 1973}to raise   
 funds for the upkeep of the reserve.  
 Recently many ladies from the village 
 made a rather unusual quilt.Each of   
 the 50 helpers contributed their own  
 nature picture and then the squares   
 were joined to make a bed cover.      </content>
