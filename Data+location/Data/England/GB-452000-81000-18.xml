		<title>18BIOGRAPHY_EMMA'S AFTERNOON.</title>
		<content> After our dinner it was time for play 
 and then my Mum drove Lisa, Paul and I
 to St. Wilfred's School in Ventnor for
 our violin lesson. When we got back to
 school all the class were working on  
 our Domesday 1985 Project. We have    
 made maps showing the land cover, and 
 also written about lives and families.
 At 3 o'clock it was time to go home   
 and I went out to play on my roller   
 boots. I came back at tea time and had
 cheese and chutney sandwiches, cake   
 and a cup of tea. My twin brother     
 Justin and I watched "Street Hawk" on 
 television - that was the programme he
 chose, but most of my friends were    
 watching "Blue Peter".  This is a     
 magazine programme for children and   
 every year it organises a charity     
 collection to help children in other  
 countries.  At 8.30 I went to bed.
