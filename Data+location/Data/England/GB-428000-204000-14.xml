		<title>14WILDLIFE IN CARTERTON &amp; AREA</title>
		<content> Within{Carterton}itself there is      
 little opportunity for wildlife to    
 flourish.Verges are cut short,most    
 gardens are tidily kept and new       
 housing has replaced the wilder areas.
 The airfield is mainly open grassland 
 and runways.Birds are actively        
 discouraged because of the{danger to  
{the aeroplanes.}Modern farming methods
 have destroyed many wild flowers in   
 the cultivated areas but it is not all
 a story of gloom. Rabbits breed       
 rapidly on the airfield. Fish have    
 been reintroduced to the streams and  
 trees replanted. The{disused railway  
{line}is a haven for wild flowers, 42  
 varieties were counted in a small     
 region. Pheasants,partridge and hares 
 find good cover in the winter wheat.  
 Kingfishers and herons feed from the  
{Shill.}People are becoming more aware 
 of the need to conserve wildlife.     </content>
