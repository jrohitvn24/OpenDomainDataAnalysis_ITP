		<title>02BUXTON, THE VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Buxton lies on a cross-roads with the 
 main route running north to south. The
 main village streets, however, run    
 east to west. These are Crown Road and
 Mill Street. It is on these streets   
 that most of the older properties are.
  There are three{public houses}though 
 only two are in this D-BLOCK. They are
 The Crown, a 17th century building,   
 and Boleyns, a new pub recently opened
 at the Mill.                          
  The{church}which is dedicated to St. 
 Andrew, lies in the centre of the     
 village along with the{Village Hall}  
 and the{School. }                     
  In recent years there have been      
 several new{property developments.}   
 These are at Church Close, Levishaw   
 Close, St.Andrew's Close, Bulwer Road 
 and Manor Close.                      
  The other main building is the Mill  
 which straddles the River Bure.       </content>
