		<content>Some of the houses in our area are very
large indeed. They could be called     
mansions and were probably built before
the First World War. Most of these do  
not have a family;they are homes for   
old people or nurses and one is an     
orphanage. Some of these big houses are
being knocked down. More modern houses 
(built in the 1930's) are still large  
and expensive (up to 100,000 pounds),  
because it is a beautiful area. There  
are often two garages because many     
people have more than one car. There   
are some quiet cul-de-sacs with small  
houses which have been built recently. 
Some people have sold their back       
gardens to builders,perhaps because the
gardens are too big and they cant be   
bothered to mow the lawn or plant      
flowers.
