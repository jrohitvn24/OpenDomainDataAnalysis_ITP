		<title>14SHOPPING FACILITIES, SEAFORD</title>
		<content>  THE SHOPPING FACILITIES IN SEAFORD   
 ARE RATHER BASIC AND HAVE NOT KEPT UP 
 WITH THE GROWING POPULATION. AT LONG  
 LAST A{BIG SUPERMARKET}IS PLANNED AND 
 SHOULD BE BUILT BY EARLY{1986.        
   IN SEAFORD WE COULD DO WITH A  FEW  
  TOYSHOPS AND SOME BIGGER AND BETTER  
 SUPERMARKETS. MANY PEOPLE  WOULD      
 APPROVE  IF THE BANKS WERE OPEN ON    
 SATURDAYS. IT SEEMS  THERE ARE FAR    
 TOO MANY{BUILDING  SOCIETIES}AND      
{ESTATE AGENTS}IN THE SHOPPING AREA. WE
 COULD DO WITH SOME BETTER SWEETSHOPS  
 EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE QUITE A FEW       
 ALREADY. NOT MANY PEOPLE  BUY CLOTHES 
 IN SEAFORD, BUT MOSTLY IN BRIGHTON OR 
 EASTBOURNE.{A PEDESTRIAN SHOPPING     
{PLACE}WOULD BE POPULAR WITH SOME.     
    THERE ARE{SMALL PARADES OF SHOPS IN
{SOME RESIDENTIAL AREAS}WHICH ARE      
 PARTICULARLY USEFUL TO THE LARGE      
 NUMBER OF ELDERLY PEOPLE.             </content>
