		<content>                                       
 The ancient manor of St. Ouen is one  
 of the most historic landmarks in     
 Jersey. It has stood for almost a     
 thousand years. It belongs to the de  
 Carteret family whose ancestors were  
 supporters of William the Conqueror.  
 Its long history is linked with the   
 Royalists, especially Charles II who  
 stayed there. Letters and personal    
 items which beloged to Charles are on 
 display in the house. During the      
 Occupation of Jersey 1940-1945 it     
 became a German barracks. The chapel  
 in the grounds has recently been      
 restored after its desecration during 
 the occupation. The Manor and grounds 
 are open to the public on Tuesday     
 afternoons and they are occasionally  
 used for special fetes and events. The
 grounds contain extensive lawns, a    
 lake and a wooded valley.             </content>
