		<content> Alkerton church is mostly Norman and  
 like Shenington, it has a Norman arch.
 The arch is not as patterned. Alkerton
 church is made of Horton stone. The   
 nave roof is decorated with a parapet 
 resting on a stone cornice. On it are 
 sculptured figures of men with        
 instruments and you can quite easily  
 pick out a man with an organ and a man
 with a harp. In the 16th century most 
 of the chancel was rebuilt. The bells 
 cannot be rung because it is not safe.
 The church and grounds are immaculate.
 At Balscote the Chapel of St Mary     
 Magdalene consists of chancel, nave, S
 aisle &amp; SW tower. It is 12th C. The   
 Methodist Chapel was built in 1850. At
 Shutford 12th C St Martin's church.   
 The nave was rebuilt in 14 C, chancel 
 in 1862, 15 C oak screen. The         
 Methodist chapel opened in 1826 but   
 closed in 1950.                       </content>
