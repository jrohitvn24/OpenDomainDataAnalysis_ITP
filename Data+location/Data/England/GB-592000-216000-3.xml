		<title>03ROUNDBUSH FARM LAYER MARNEY</title>
		<content> Mr and Mrs A J Round are arable       
 farmers. They own 700 acres of land.  
 They have a turbo charged tractor.    
 The seat cost Â£2500! 2 full time men, 
 1 partime man and a student work for  
 him. Mrs Round has 10 horses which she
 trains for shows. The house was first 
 built in 1400. The timber frames      
 inside were growing when the first    
 Domesday book was being written. The  
 house has no foundations. It rests on 
 wooden rafts. In the Second World War 
 a bomb dropped nearby and damaged     
 it. The Rounds have got 2 Labradors, 1
 Dachshund, and a Lurcher. They used to
 have 400 sheep, but they gave them up 
 20 years ago. Mr and Mrs Round have   
 lived here 34 years, but Mr Round's   
 family have farmed in the area since  
 1726. He loves farming and his home.  
 Mechanisation is the greatest  change 
 he has seen.                          </content>
