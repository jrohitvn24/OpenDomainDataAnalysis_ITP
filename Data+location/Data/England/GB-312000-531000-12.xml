 Southern Scotland and the Pennines    
 come to show their milk and beef      
 cattle and sheep. There are show      
 jumping competitions. Horses are also 
 shown in the rings, they range from   
 the great Clydesdales to the small    
 Shetland ponies and their foals. There
 are many items which are entered in
