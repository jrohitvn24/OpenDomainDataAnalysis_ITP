		<title>13Facelift for Briars Hall</title>
		<content>Briars Hall is an impressive landmark  
in our block. Situated on Briars Lane  
it was part of the Lathom estate,but   
in recent years has been used as a     
restaurant.However,at the start of 1985
it closed and since then has been      
completely refurbished.                
Cause Row Ltd.of Bootle undertook the  
work and it is due to open in August.  
The Hall is to re-open as a 12 bedroom 
hotel.There will also be a public bar. 
When we visited the site in June we    
asked Mr David McNamee,the prospective 
manager,more about the plans for the   
Hall.He said that one of the old barns 
adjacent to the Hall is going to be    
made into a type of steak house.       
The Hall will also cater for weddings  
and conferences.It will appear in a    
publication of 1986 called "The Guide  
to the Best Hotels in Great Britain."  
and hopes to be a 3 star hotel.        </content>
