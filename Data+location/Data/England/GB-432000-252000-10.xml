        PROVING GROUND                 
 This was a military airfield from 1942
 to 1972. It has been used as a        
 passenger car testing ground since    
 1979. The cars are not yet for the    
 market so they try to screen them from
 the public.                           
 The land falls away to the SE and NW  
 which gives poor visibility from      
 surrounding roads but they have also  
 built a 2.5 m high fence along the    
 13km perimeter and mounds in areas    
 close to houses and roads. Earth for  
 these mounds was taken from places on 
 site which then gave the ups and downs
 necessary for testing vehicles but not
 present on airfields. 300 buildings   
 were demolished and the rest          
 refurbished for workshops and offices.
