 The area around the Green is now      
 built up, with housing on the two long
 sides. A large public house and public
 car park lie to the south. The shops  
 in the village are mostly small, but  
 are varied. They provide for the basic
 needs of the community who are in easy
 reach of excellent facilities in      
 Tunbridge Wells. An adaptation to     
 modern life can be seen in the Chinese
 takeaway which is about to open. Four 
 years ago there was the suggestion    
 that Pembury should have a            
 supermarket. Planning delays and a    
 public inquiry delayed the project. It
 is now felt that there is little hope 
 of such a development as two          
 supermarket stores are being developed
 in Tunbridge Wells.
