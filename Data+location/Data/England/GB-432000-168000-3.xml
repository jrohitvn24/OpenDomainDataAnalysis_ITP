		<content>    The large sporting estates and     
 extensive ares of open common land    
 round Hungerford _ together with the  
 Canal, Rivers Kennet and Dun and their
 small tributaries wandering across the
 valley provide excellent habitat for  
 birds of both Wetland and Farmland    
 species. Little Grebe,Mallard Tufted  
 Duck, Mute Swan, Canada Goose, Coot   
 and Moorhen are seen all the year on  
 the waterways. Herons regularly feed  
 at the Berks Trout Farm and at least 6
 pairs of Kingfishers breed locally. In
 the reed beds and marshes high numbers
 of summer migrants, such as Reed and  
 Sedge Warblers and occasionally       
 Grasshopper Warblers together with    
 resident Reed Buntings breed.         
 The House Martin colony at the Primary
 school has about 30 pairs but is now  
 in decline. Barn Owls are not now     
 often seen in the area.               </content>
