		<title>03BURTON HOSPITAL CLUB</title>
		<content>The hospital club is just off Belvoir  
Road,as you go up the drive you can    
see the cricket pitch.At the hospital  
club they play cricket in the league   
and for the shield.All the cricketers  
get a tea of sandwiches or salad.You   
can rent a room for the evening for a  
dance or meeting and every week there  
is a dance.A little while ago I went to
a dance and they had a raffle,feeling  
in a good mood I bought ten tickets for
a pound.When they had the draw I won a 
huge teddy bear (made by the doctors   
and nurses) that was only a little bit 
shorter than me when it was standing up
straight.So now I've got it in my      
bedroom.There are also a few one armed 
bandits (that hardly ever pay          
out).There is a bar that stays open to 
11.00pm Mondays to Saturdays and on    
Sundays it is open to 10.30pm.
