		<content>  On Sundays I like going swimming at  
 Gloucester Leisure Centre with my     
 family.I also play football at John   
 Danial's Playing Field with my        
 friends.                              
  At school I play football in the     
 winter and cricket in the summer.Our  
 school is the Gloucestershire         
  under-11's cricket champions and we  
 are playing The West Midlands next    
 week.If we win we go into the national
 finals.                               
  At school I play netball in the      
 winter and Danish rounders in the     
 summer.This is a bit different from   
 ordinary rounders as it is easier.I   
 like playing leapfrog with my friends 
 on the field and we also play         
 hide-and-seek and dub-dub-in.When it  
 is hot we go swimming and sometimes we
 play tennis.                          
                                       </content>
