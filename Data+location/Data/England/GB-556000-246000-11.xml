		<title>11LANDSCAPE OF LINTON</title>
		<content>   On Rivey hill hedgerows are very    
 common along the fields surrounding   
 Linton.On top of Rivey hill the crops 
 are mostly wheat and barley.The hilly 
 fields roll up and down like waves in 
 the  sea.Linton looks very wooded     
 although there are hardly any         
 individual trees.There are at least   
 three woods when you look around which
 are fairly close together.One can see 
 the poplar trees around Linton Village
 College.                              
   At the bottom of Rivey hill there is
 a Telephone Exchange.There is a line  
 of never ending pylons which carry    
 electricity over Linton.In the        
 distance one can see large silos which
 hold grain.Houses on the edge of Rivey
 hill look very modern.                
   Linton looks very small from up here
