		<title>01Review of Caversham/Sonning</title>
		<content> This area borders the large town of   
 Reading on the north.  Part of the    
 area is in Berkshire and contains the 
 residential suburbs of lower Caversham
 and Caversham Park. These are served  
 by primary schools, shops, churches,  
 recreational facilities and           
 allotments. Reading crematorium and   
 the B.B.C. overseas monitoring station
 are also situated here.               
   Caversham is divided from Reading by
 the River Thames which flows from the 
 south-west to the north-east. The     
 river forms the boundary between Berks
 and Oxon in this area. On the north of
 the river are large gravel pits in use
 but leaving space for angling, sailing
 and water-skiing. There is only one   
 old bridge over the river at Sonning; 
 an additional bridge now seems likely.
     The remaining area in Oxon is farm
 land, the chalk hills rising steeply. </content>
