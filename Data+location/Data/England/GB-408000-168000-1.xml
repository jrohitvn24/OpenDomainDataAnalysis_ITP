		<title>01The area around Avebury</title>
		<content> The immediate area around the village 
 of Avebury is mainly agricultural     
 land of dairy and mixed farming.      
 The countryside is exceptionally rich 
 in prehistoric remains and a network  
 of footpaths puts these within easy   
 reach of the walker. Dominating the   
 area are the prehistoric stone circles
 with the huge circular bank and ditch,
 and the mysterious chalk pyramid of   
 Silbury Hill. Leading up to the main  
 circle are the huge megaliths of the  
 West Kennet Avenue.                   
 St.James Church, in the centre of the 
 village was first built in Saxon      
 times.                                
 The area boasts two manor houses,     
 Avebury Manor(open to the public) and 
 the smaller private Trusloe Manor.
