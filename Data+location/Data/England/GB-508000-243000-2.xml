		<title>02Cotton End Housing</title>
		<content> The majority of houses in Cotton End  
 are fairly equally divided between    
 owner occupied and rented             
 accommodation.  There are about 500   
 households most of whom live in       
 modest, average looking houses of     
 little particular architectural       
 interest.  There is a block of flats  
 at the southern edge of the village   
 which is particularly unattractive    
 with their flat roofs and bright blue 
 exterior paintwork.  However, this    
 block does contain some rather fine   
 old farmhouses and small cottages,    
 many of which are listed buildings.   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
