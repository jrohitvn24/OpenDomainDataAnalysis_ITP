		<title>06Transport in NW Derby</title>
		<content> There are two main forms of transport 
 through the NW sector:{rail}&amp;{road.   
 East of the city centre is the main   
 London/Sheffield line, crossed by the 
 NE/SW Newcastle/Bristol main line.    
 North of the passenger station, St.   
 Mary's Goods Yard ceased operation at 
 the end of the 1970's with the change 
 to container transport. Directly from 
 the West to the city centre is the    
 abandoned track of the former Great   
 Northern Railway; no alternative land 
 use has been found for the greater    
 part of it.                           
 The incomplete 1930's Ring Road, the  
 A5111, has been outgrown by traffic   
 load, particularly NE/SW. The         
 "Allestree Link", a major new road,   
 now continues the A38 through Derby to
 link M5/M6 to M1. Important roads link
 Derby to other towns: A52, A6, A514,  
 A516, A61.                            </content>
