		<content> The block mainly consists of farming  
 land. The majority of farms being     
 owned by North Yorkshire County       
 Council. Most of the farms were       
 originally instituted by the council  
 for men returning home from the great 
 war. Initially the tenancy was handed 
 down from father to son but, in recent
 years, the council policy has been to 
 rescind the tenancy of the smaller    
 farms and divide the land amongst     
 neighbouring farmers. The area is     
 greatly influenced by both the R.A.F. 
 station and the Army Garrison, which  
 are close by. Both camps provide      
 employment, influence peoples home    
 life and life style. Recreation and   
 religion play a major part in the area
 as do local history, tourism and      
 trade. All of which affect residents  
 thoughts and hopes for the future.
