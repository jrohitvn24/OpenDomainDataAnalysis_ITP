		<content>  This block contains churches of many 
 denominations.                        
  The Sheerwater Estate has the Roman  
 Catholic Church of St. John the       
 Evangelist at one end of its parade of
 shops and St. Michael's Shared Church 
 at the other. This latter recently    
 built church is shared by Anglicans   
 and Methodists and is a daughter      
 church of the high Anglican Church    
 of All Saints, Woodham.               
  Another Anglican church, St. Paul's, 
 is situated in Oriental Road opposite 
 the Mosque.                           
  The nuns of St. Peter's Convent      
 worship in their chapel on Maybury    
 Hill close to St.Columba's, a retreat 
 house belonging to the Anglican       
 diocese of Guildford.                 
  Trinity Methodist Church is in       
 Brewery Road and Courtenay Free Church
 in Walton Road.                       </content>
