		<title>03FARMING IN LITTLE KIMBLE</title>
		<content>   There are upwards of 25 farms in the
 block of which only 2 or 3 are used   
 for mainly growing crops. The rest are
 small Dairy and Sheep farms.          
   Dodd's Farm near{North Lee}still has
 its milk collected in milk churns     
 daily instead of by tanker as is more 
 usual today.                          
   Meadowbrook Farm on the Aylesbury   
 Road has an Ickneild herd of{Charolais
{Cattle}which is rare in the area      
 (being mainly kept in Devon).         
   In the northeast of the block is an 
{agricultural research centre}which    
 develops new types of fertiliser and  
 experiments with crops.               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
