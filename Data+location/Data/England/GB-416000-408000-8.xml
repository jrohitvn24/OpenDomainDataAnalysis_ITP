		<content> Cliffe House is a large stone detached
 house in ten acres of land and built  
 at the end of the last century. Since 
 1948 it has been used as an outdoor   
 centre for children, first of all from
 the Dewsbury area and then from the   
 Kirklees District. Each year up to    
 fifty five schools use the Centre     
 residentially while there are fifty   
 day visits. On average, 3,000 children
 and staff visit the centre each year  
 for Environmental Education.          
 Whilst at the Centre the children     
 study farming, villages, woodlands,   
 hedgerows, ponds and other topics     
 connected with the environment, under 
 the specialist eye of the warden Mr.  
 Swindon. In the grounds there is a    
 wood, two ponds, a herb garden and a  
 playing field. By coincidence some of 
 the stained glass windows depict      
 nature scenes, mostly of birdlife.    </content>
