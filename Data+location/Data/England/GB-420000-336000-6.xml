		<title>06CHAPEL HOUSE FARM</title>
		<content> Chapel House Farm is at Lower         
 Thurvaston near Longford Lane. It     
 belongs to my grandparents. It is more
 than 400 years old. I think it is a   
 very interesting house. There are 3   
 sheds and 1 farm house. The farm house
 has a thatched roof and there is a big
 orchard. The thatched roof is checked 
 every year to keep it fresh. There is 
 a little pond at the side of the      
 house. The house is painted black and 
 white, the black is timber. There are 
 lots of trees around the back. The    
 pond has some ducks and ducklings on. 
 The house has not changed outside but 
 inside it has changed a bit but not   
 much . My Grandma lives there with her
 little dog. There are some sheep and  
 pigs there. My Grandma has lived there
 for quite a while. My father works    
 there now.
