		<content>     People in the Trowbridge area work
 in a variety of places such as Post   
 Offices, Ushers Ales, Airsprung,      
 Bowyers, Shoe shops, Local Government,
 County Hall, South West Gas, Waldens, 
 Tesco, Fine Fare and the Technical    
 College. The main shops in Trowbridge 
 today are Tesco and Fine Fare. Both   
 shops use electronic tills to add up  
 the prices of their customers         
 purchases. Tesco sells clothes, hair  
 products, food and drinks. Fine Fare  
 sells food, drink and hair products.  
 The wages vary according to the length
 of time that people work and the shop 
 they work in. Unemployment is the     
 problem of today. The number of       
 people unemployed increases every     
 year. That's why some of our shops    
 have closed down. Banks are where we  
 store our money. Most banks are never 
 short of workers.                     </content>
