		<content>The woodland tree species are mixed,   
some the result of mans influence.     
There is not much evidence of current  
woodland management. Beech and oak are 
common with some silver birch and hazel
which may have been coppiced in the    
past. Braken, holly and gorse are      
common lower storey plants especially  
where the woodland opens into Keston   
common. The ground layer plants include
a great variety of grasses, herbs and  
wild flowers especially along the edge 
of the woodlands and field boundaries. 
common species - white &amp; red campion,  
trefoils, daises, buttercups, hogweed, 
pantains, &amp; labiates. The agricultural 
land is mainly small fields with many  
hedgerows providing an ideal habitat   
for wild flowers, small trees and      
birdlife. Poppies growing among the    
cereals suggest a poor level of        
management.                            </content>
