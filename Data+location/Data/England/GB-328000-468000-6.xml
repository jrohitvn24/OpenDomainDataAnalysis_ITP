		<content> John    and    his    pals   come from
 Flookburgh, which  is a village at the
 other side of the estuary. They had to
 drive 17 miles round by  road  to  get
 here. They come especially to fish for
 shrimps   John   and   his  pals  wear
 protective clothing like waders,  bib,
 braces  and waterproof  suits.  Woolly
 hats cover their ears.  John  and  his
 mates use big heavy tractors  and  use
 big trailers that are attached to  the
 back of  the  tractors.  The  trailers
 have long  booms  which have nets tied
 to them. The nets  have  mesh  about a
 centimetre square  and  when  they are
 fishing they open  out  the  booms  so
 that the nets  are  about  ten  metres
 wide and about a metre  deep. They are
 dragged along the bottom in upto three
 metres of water.
