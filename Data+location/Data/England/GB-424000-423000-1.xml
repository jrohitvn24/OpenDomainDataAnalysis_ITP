 Batley is a town in the county of West
 Yorkshire and has a population of     
 about 45,000.The town centre is in the
 bottom of a valley along which runs   
 the main road linking Dewsbury and    
 Bradford.Most of the commercial and   
 industrial buildings are on either    
 side of this main road with the main  
 areas of housing being on the valley  
 sides.                                
 Most of the industrial buildings were 
 built during the period from 1850 to  
 1900,although there have been new     
 shops built in the centre of the town 
 and some new industrial and commercial
 building.                             
 Many of the mills built to produce    
 cloth in the 19th. century are now    
 used to store various kinds of things 
 other than producing cloth.
