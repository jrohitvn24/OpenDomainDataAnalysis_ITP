		<content> The village of Camblesforth is a      
 development area. This is explained by
 the proximity of both Drax Power      
 Station and the Selby Coal Field. The 
 present population is about 1300 and  
 this is growing. If and when the NCB  
 goes ahead with colliery closures it  
 is expected that several hundred      
 miners will be redeployed to Selby and
 this will ensure that the village will
 continue to grow. Village housing is  
 therefore a mixture of old houses and 
 modern development. The Croft Estate  
 is the latest development of private  
 houses. These consist of detached and 
 semi-detached houses and bungalows    
 together with the modern              
 "cottage-style" houses that use a     
 largely open plan interior to maximise
 very limited space. The Croft Estate  
 can expand still further with space   
 for several hundred more houses.      </content>
