		<content>  West Hove Golf Course is the only    
 green space linking town and country  
 along the A27 in Southwick &amp; Hove.Its 
 future has been under threat for more 
 than 10 years.The Brighton by-pass is 
 scheduled to take the top part,while a
 link road will run up most of its     
 length.Wimpeys the house builders own 
 it.The roads have been approved by the
 Government,but it is uncertain that   
 they will be built because of public  
 spending objections &amp; strong protests 
 by the National Trust.The golf clubs  
 wants to move north of the by-pass,but
 the Government rejected this idea.Hove
 Council has produced 2 options.One to 
 use part of the land for much-needed  
 housing.The other is to keep what     
 remains between road functions as a   
 green space.                          
  There is a case for housing,provided 
 it's low cost to meet Hove's (CONT-7) </content>
