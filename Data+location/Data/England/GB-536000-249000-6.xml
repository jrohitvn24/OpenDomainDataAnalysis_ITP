		<title>06Barrington May Day</title>
		<content> The big event of the year in the 1950s
 was May Day and the maypole dancing. A
 May Queen was chosen by the juniors   
 and was crowned by the previous year's
 Queen. We had a radio but no TV or    
 video. I enjoyed my schooldays at     
 Barrington and I am now the school    
 cook. When I was at school there were 
 no meals cooked in school. Some things
 are the same - the thatched roofed    
 school house, the bell tower on the   
 hall and the lime trees in the        
 playground.
