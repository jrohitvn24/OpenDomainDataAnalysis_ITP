		<content>  Riverside Industries is a work-centre
 for  handicapped  people  who  can use
 public transport but wouldn't be happy
 in an ordinary  factory. However, some
 people learn  enough  at  Riverside to
 get an ordinary job.                  
   They go there to learn  about  work,
 to  communicate  with  people , and to
 improve their  mobility  to  have  the
 satisfaction of making things.        
   Some of the people  we  spoke to had
 problems in using their arms and legs,
 some were deaf  and  some  had trouble
 with their  speech. They  made  wooden
 panels,wooden cots and dolls.         
  "I had never spoken to anyone who was
 handicapped  before so I was  a little
 afraid  they  might  upset  me  but  I
 enjoyed the visit and would like to go
 again.                                
  "They aren't "the  handicapped" , but
 are "people with handicaps."          </content>
