		<title>09THE MARKET PLACE</title>
		<content> Bishop Auckland has seen many new     
 developments recently. The main new   
 development in the town centre is the 
{Fine Fare Superstore}complex which was
 opened in 1984 near to the ancient    
 market place with its C18-French style
 town hall and the adjoining{St.Anne's 
{Church and Visitors' Centre.          
 The{market place}has been{redeveloped 
 this year and some children from      
{St.Anne's C.E.Primary School}were at  
 the official opening.                 
    My name is Victoria Clark and I    
 was at the market place when it was   
 opened. There were brightly coloured  
 stalls with canvas tops. Also,there   
 was a busker playing his guitar. The  
{Town Crier}from Alnwick opened the    
 market, ringing his bell. He was      
 dressed in a bright red coat and a    
 black hat. The Chairman of{Durham     
{County Council}came to talk to us.    </content>
