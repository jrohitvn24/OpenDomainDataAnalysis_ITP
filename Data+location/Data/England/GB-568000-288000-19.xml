		<title>19LEISURE IN FELTWELL</title>
		<content>   When we talked to people in the     
 village we found that residents       
 enjoyed a wide range of activities in 
 their spare time. Some complained of  
 lack of facilities in the area and    
 many travelled out to places such as  
 Thetford for entertainment.           
   Gardening, reading, walking, riding,
 golf and other outdoor pursuits seemed
 popular,and of course television.     
 Local pubs and clubs provide a limited
 night life with darts,snooker etc.    
   In Feltwell we have several clubs,  
 including Youth Club, Football club,  
 cubs, brownies, Scouts and Guides,    
 Judo, Ty-Condo, W.I., over sixties,   
 C.A.T.S. (Theatre) and swimming.      
 The swimming pool was given to the    
 School by the Edmund de Moundeford    
 Trust. Now 1l00 people from local     
 schools and families from the area use
 it each week.                         </content>
