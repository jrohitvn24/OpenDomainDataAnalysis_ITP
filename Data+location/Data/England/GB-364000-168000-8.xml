		<title>08My School Day (Karen aged 8)</title>
		<content>   The first thing I do on any morning 
 except Saturday and Sunday is to go to
 school. My class lines up at five min-
 utes to nine and then the bell goes   
 and our teacher lets us in. When we   
 come in we sometimes do our times     
 tables in our number books. Then we go
 into Assembly. We sing hymns about God
 and Jesus and nature. We sometimes    
 pray or perform a play and listen to  
 records and stories. The headmaster   
 gives out swimming certificates (we go
 swimming every Monday). Every day we  
 do some writing and mathematics.      
 Occasionally we do sewing, cooking,   
 P.E. and Games, reading, music, hand- 
 writing and art and craft. We watch   
 Zig-Zag on television every Monday.   
 Sometimes we use the computer or the  
 listening centre (a tape recorder with
 eight pairs of headphones).
