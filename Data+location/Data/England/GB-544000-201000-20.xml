		<title>20THE DOMESDAY EXPERIENCE</title>
		<content> "I have learned a lot about my town   
 and the people in it."                
 "I've never done anything quite so    
 special."                             
 "I think that Domesday has made us    
 all grow older."                      
 "It was great being a 'square         
 searcher' and writing about things you
 have never seen or heard of before."  
 "Domesday  made us expert map-        
 readers."                             
 "The fun bit was going out and        
 interviewing,and meeting new people." 
 "I have never known people to be so   
 kind, and to give time to help us."   
 "I think that Domesday is something   
 that will tell people about our lives 
 900  years later.We have read about   
 people who lived 900 years ago:they   
 led hard and troublesome lives.We do  
 too- sometimes."
