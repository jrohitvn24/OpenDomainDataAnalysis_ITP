		<title>06WRAY EDUCATIONAL TRUST</title>
		<content> An educational charity exists in Leven
 to assist the young people of the     
 village. Since 1977 when the trust was
 first set up, many individuals  and   
 organisations within Leven have been  
 assisted financially. Ten per cent of 
 the Trust's income goes to fund       
 activities of the Parochial Church    
 Council, Sunday School &amp; Leven Primary
 School. The School benefits           
 tremendously as the Wray Trust        
 supplies things which the Education   
 Authority cannot normally supply. Most
 recently the Trust provided a second  
 computer, photocopier &amp; heat copier.  
  The Wray Educational Trust is open to
 all residents who have lived in Leven 
 for three or more years &amp; who are     
 under 25 years old. The money is      
 specifically to benefit young people  
 educationally.                        
                                       </content>
