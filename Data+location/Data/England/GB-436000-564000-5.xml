		<title>05WESTOE PIT</title>
		<content> I am Lisa aged nine.I live near{Westoe
{Pit}it is a very big coal mine.It     
 stretches six miles out to sea.{Coal }
{mining}is one of the biggest          
 industries in the North East with its 
 related services.The colliery         
 employs over 2,300 men and produces   
 1.2 million tonnes of coal a year.My  
 dad works there with my uncle and     
 grandad.Last year the miners were on  
 strike for 12 months.                 
   Westoe Pit has lots of coal reserves
 far out{under the North Sea.}The pit  
{is }1,333ft. deep.There are 30 coal   
 cutting machines and Westoe is one of 
 the most efficient mines in the       
 country.Lots of money has been        
 invested in the pit.                  
   The other local pits Harton and     
 Marsden have closed in the last 20    
 years.Today the streets around the pit
 are cleaner due to the smokeless zone.</content>
