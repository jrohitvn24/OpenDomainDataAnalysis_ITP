		<title>05NETTLETON-AN OVERVIEW</title>
		<content> Unlike many villages in this area     
 Nettleton has grown over the last 30  
 years in terms of population and      
 housing.Some of the inhabitants work  
 in the large towns nearby,Grimsby and 
 Scunthorpe as well as the smaller     
 market towns of Brigg,Caistor and     
 Market Rasen.The population has       
 increased from 469 in 1951 to approx. 
 640 in 1977.Although the rate of      
 housing growth is slow there are five 
 new bungalows being erected in Cooks  
 Lane.The range of facilities in the   
 village is limited but residents are  
 in easy reach of those in Caistor and 
 local transport can take them to the  
 larger towns nearby.The main sources  
 of local employment were farming and  
 mining but the mine has closed and    
 employment in agriculture is on the   
 decline and most villagers commute to 
 work.                                 </content>
