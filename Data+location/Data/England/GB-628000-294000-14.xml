		<title>14LANDSCAPE/BUILDINGS:WOODTON</title>
		<content> The landscape is open &amp; pleasing with 
 wide views of gently undulating arable
 land,rising from below 100' to 150'   
 A.S.L.,not broken by many hedges but  
 by groups of trees such as oaks,ash &amp; 
 maple.There is woodland north of      
 Woodton Church &amp; a substantial tract  
 at nearby Hedenham.Several moats are  
 to be found eg.around Woodton Old Hall
 The flatness of the countryside made  
 Seething ideal for the wartime air-   
 field built in 1942-3,but a band of   
 gravel has been eroded by the stream  
 running along Woodton Street to form a
 relatively steep-sided small valley.  
 Woodton village lies over .5 mile from
 its C13 church with its round tower.  
 There are several interesting old     
 houses in the area;5 are listed grade 
 II &amp; 1, Oak Farm is grade II**; there 
 are 6 grade III,the latter under revi-
 sion &amp; may be upgraded to protect them</content>
