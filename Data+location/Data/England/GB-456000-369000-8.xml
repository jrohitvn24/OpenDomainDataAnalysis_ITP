		<title>08Welbeck Pit in the 1970/80s</title>
		<content> The loss of man-power in the 1960s led
 to the introduction of a successful   
 incentive scheme,mainly pushed through
 by Nottinghamshire miners.            
  By 1979 the pits overproducing and   
 stock piles grew,at Welbeck Colliery  
 in particular,as they had plenty of   
 room to store the excess coal.This led
 to the strike of 1984 having          
 relatively little effect on the power 
 output of the country since existing  
 stocks were ample to "outlast" the    
 strike.                               
  When the 1984 strike started there   
 were 480 men on strike out of         
 Welbeck's workforce of 1265,but by    
 March 1985 it had dropped down to 80  
 hardened strikers.The area was visited
 regularly by pickets from neighbouring
 areas and there was much ill-feeling  
 in Meden Vale,whose inhabitants quote 
 the strike as the area's worst event. </content>
