		<title>16SAINT MARYS CHURCH</title>
		<content> St. Marys Church is a quiet place     
 with its big east window and the tall 
 bell tower. The brass lectern is a    
 perfect stand for the bible or other  
 books. The church also has a beautiful
 carved wooden litany desk which sits  
 next to the pews.The enormous electric
 organ has toe pistons, a pedal board, 
 stops a key board, a swell pedal, and 
 of course lots of big pipes  nearly   
 reaching the ceiling. The hatchment at
 the back of the church is also very   
 big and looks like a picture turned   
 sideways. It has a big shield on it.  
 The altar underneath the east window  
 is a wooden table with a lovely       
 patterned sheet over it. The font at  
 the back of the pews has a lovely     
 carved lid with flowers carved out of 
 it. The front of it is carved too, but

 out of stone, is also carved very     </content>
