		<content> My favourite food is Fish and Chips   
 but I eat a lot of other foods as     
 well. Chinese food is perhaps the most
 common food in our house as all the   
 family are mad on it. My favourite    
 Chinese dish is fried chicken and     
 sweet and sour pork or a pancake roll.
 That is made from a light batter      
 filled with prawns and all different  
 kinds of fried things that I wouldn't 
 like to try and identify. I also like 
 Indian food but not as much as Chinese
 food. Fom what you have just read you 
 may think that I eat nothing but fish 
 and chips and foreign food but I do   
 eat other things as well. A popular   
 meal at home is steak in either onion,
 curry or tandoury sauce. Come to think
 this probably makes even that a       
 foreign dish. Ah well- c'est la vie   
 and all that!
