		<content> The study area is located on the edge 
 of the{Berksire Downs,}a range of     
{chalk hills}which provides a gently   
 undulating landscape of woodland,     
 hedgerows and grassland. Although much
 of the area is cultivated, some slopes
 are too steep for machinery and are   
 covered in grass or deciduous         
 woodland. The natural{woodland        
 includes most commonly{oaks, beeches, 
{horse chestnuts, sycamores}with       
 occasional{limes, elms,}and{willow    
 trees can be found along the banks of 
 the{Pang.}Foxhunting and steep        
 hillsides have encouraged farmers to  
 keep the fields small and permit the  
 growth of tall hedgerows. Common      
 mammals include{rabbits, hares, grey  
{squirrels, hedgehogs, small rodents   
 and{fallow deer}while there is        
 evidence of{badgers}and{foxes,}these  
 are rarely seen.                      </content>
