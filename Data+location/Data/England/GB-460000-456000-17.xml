		<title>17COMPUTER POPULARITY</title>
		<content>  The most common computer of the 80's,
 I suppose, is the Spectrum 48K,closely
 followed by the Electron and the BBC. 
  At school we have 3 BBC model B's,   
 one with disc drive and the others    
 with cassettes.We use them mostly for 
 educational games and programs.       
  At home I have an Electron computer  
 with an analogue to digital valve     
 converter socket which you can plug   
 into light pens, joysticks and        
 paddles.I also borrow an interface    
 from a friend which makes it          
 compatible with a printer.            
  I use my computer for games, copying,
 and programs like Burglar Alarms or   
 educational games for my younger      
 sister.                               
  I now know 5 people who have an      
 Electron and 6 people who have a BBC  
 computer.
