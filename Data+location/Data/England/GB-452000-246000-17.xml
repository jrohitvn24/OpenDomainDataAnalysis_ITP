		<content>{TRAFFORD HOUSE FARM}                  
A beautiful family run farm on the edge
of our block.Of particular interest due
to the site of the Medieval Village on 
the land.Mostly sheep kept but also a  
few Polo ponies for the family use.    
{BLACKBIRD HILL FARM}                  
A typical example of a small family    
farm,surviving in competition with     
large commercial concerns.Mr and Mrs   
Leadbeater,the farmer and his wife and 
their two children all work on the farm
and enjoy their life.Their land is all 
permanent pasture,they keep sheep.A    
typical day starts at 6:30am and ends  
at dark,except at lambing time when    
they sometimes have to stay up all     
night looking after the ewes and their 
lambs.MrLeadbeater sometimes comes in  
for his dinner and sometimes has it    
outside when Mrs Leadbeater makes him  
sandwiches or brings it to him.        </content>
