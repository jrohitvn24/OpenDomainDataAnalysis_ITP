		<title>03A 10-YEAR OLD'S DAY, CROYDON</title>
		<content>     On Saturday I get up at 7 am and  
get dressed, and brush my teeth.  I    
make my breakfast - bacon and egg - and
drink some milk. At 9 am I do my home- 
work for Chinese school (I go to ordin-
ary school during the week).  I help my
mum to clean the house, and later my   
dad goes to work.                      
     I wait for my uncle to collect my 
mum, sister, little brother and myself 
to take us to my cousin's restaurant   
where we help.                         
     At 12 noon I have lunch.  We use a
pair of chopsticks and we have a bowl  
of rice and Chinese food.  When we have
finished my cousin takes my sister,    
little brother and me to their house   
and we play snooker.                   
     At 5 pm my uncle takes us back to 
the restaurant, then after dinner he   
takes us home.
