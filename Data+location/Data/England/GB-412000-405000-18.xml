		<title>18Recollections of Holmfirth</title>
		<content> We interviewed a lady who has lived in
 Holmfirth for fifty-seven years to see
 how things had changed."Quite a few   
 years ago Rotcher(a road in Holmfirth)
 was much quieter.Men used to come     
 around to the houses selling pots.The 
 milk was brought around on a cart     
 pulled by a horse too.The milk came in
 a big churn.You got your own jug and  
 told the milkman how much you         
 wanted.Rotcher is very busy now with  
 cars taking children up to school.    
 There were very few cars in days gone 
 by.Since tourists have started coming 
 to the town things have changed a     
 great deal.Many of the shops are      
 geared to selling things for tourists 
 and the town has become very busy.The 
 tourists started coming when 'Last of 
 the Summer Wine' was filmed here."
