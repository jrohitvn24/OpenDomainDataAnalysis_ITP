		<content> The area covered by our survey is     
 notable for its very rural character. 
 There is no village in it, though it  
 is surrounded by villages and as a    
 result the amenities are notable for  
 their absence. At first sight the land
 appeared to be all farm land but on   
 further investigation we found that   
 several former farms had changed in   
 recent years under the pressure on    
 agriculture and are now thriving small
 businesses in tourism,crafts or local 
 trade and service. This is an area of 
 rolling hills and streams with narrow 
 lanes and high hedges making a        
 confusing pattern for the unwary      
 visitor who could be forgiven for     
 thinking that civilisation is miles   
 away whereas the area is very close to
 Torbay, Totnes and Newton Abbot.
