		<title>10A Talk given by Resident "A"</title>
		<content> One of our senior citizens who has    
 lived in the area all his life came   
 to our school to talk to us about     
 changing times. It was interesting to 
 hear about how life has changed since 
 he was a boy.  He left school when he 
 was 14 and worked on a farm as did    
 many of his friends. When a teacher   
 came into the classroom, all the      
 children had to stand.  He stayed in  
 the same school from 5 to 14 as there 
 wasn't a secondary school.  There was 
 very little farm machinery then so all
 the fields were ploughed using horses.
 He had to use a pump to fetch water   
 and he bathed in a tin tub once a     
 week.  He was very interested in music
 and joined the local Brass Band in    
 1927.  There weren't many cars on the 
 roads when he was a boy but a local   
 man used to hire out a bicycle for 6d 
 a week.                               </content>
