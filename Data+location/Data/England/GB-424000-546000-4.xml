		<content>      The crop which has greatly       
 increased in recent years is Oil Seed 
 Rape. (easily recognised by its bright
 yellow flowers in early summer).      
      Only one farm in the area tends  
 to be different from the general      
 pattern of crop production -          
 Mr.S.Johnson's farm at Plawsworth.    
     He farms 240 acres. There are no  
 animals but in addition to the usual  
 crops he has recently introduced soft 
 fruit (Strawberries,Raspberries and   
 Gooseberries) with great success.     
    The Johnston family have farmed    
 here for 170 years.
