		<content> Most people are concerned with the    
 wider issues of today, especially the 
 threat of nuclear war. There is also a
 general concern about the problem of  
 drug abuse, and they worry lest their 
 own youngsters are offered drugs.     
 There is also a growing concern about 
 the increase in violence and may      
 people especially the elderly fear    
 burglary. The nearness of High Point  
 Prison aggravates this feeling of     
 insecurity. At a more personal and    
 village level, most people hope the   
 village will remain the peaceful rural
 place it now is. There is a general   
 interest in conserving the countryside
 and the appearance of the houses, ie, 
 rethatching the cottages instead of   
 replacing by tiles or slate. Yet again
 some would like improved street       
 lighting &amp; others are frustrated by   
 restrictions on housing and renovation</content>
