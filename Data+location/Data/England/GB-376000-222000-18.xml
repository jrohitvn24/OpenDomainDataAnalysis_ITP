		<title>18BARBER'S BRIDGE, RUDFORD</title>
		<content> Barber's Bridge is notable for two    
 features and is frequently visited    
 by sightseers and historians. An      
 obelisk built from stones from        
 Gloucester's medieval walls was       
 erected after the discovery in 1868 of
 86 skeletons believed to be those of  
 Welsh soldiers who fell in 1643,      
 following the Battle of Highnam, while
 fighting for Charles I's Royalist     
 Army. Nearby, the earthworks of the   
 Gloucester_Ledbury Canal are clearly  
 visible. This was constructed in 1798 
 to transport coal, and was extended to
 Hereford in 1845. In 1887, the Great  
 Western Railway Line was built from   
 Gloucester-Ledbury along its length;  
 this closed in 1964. Although now both
 dwelling houses, the stationmaster's  
 house and the station itself at       
 Barbers Bridge have been carefully    
 preserved architecturally.            </content>
