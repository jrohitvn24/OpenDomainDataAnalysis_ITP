		<content> There is no Chancel arch in the       
 church, but a Perpendicular Rood      
 Screen extending from floor to ceiling
 divides the Chancel from the Nave. On 
 either side of the screen, behind the 
 pulpit and lectern, are large, framed,
 illustrated manuscripts of the Ten    
 Commandments.                         
 The Communion Rail in the Chancel     
 dates to the late 17th Century.       
 Among the monuments in the church are 
 thse to Sarah (1730) and Hugh Bethell.
 These date to the period when much of 
 the surrounding area, including the   
 Priory site, passed by marriage into  
 the Bethell family.                   
 On the south wall of the Chancel is a 
 priest door and a piscina - a basin   
 for washing Communion vessels. Its    
 drain is now blocked.                 
 The mounds in the field to the N.E. of
 the churchyard are the Priory remains.</content>
