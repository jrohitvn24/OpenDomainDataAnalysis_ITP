		<title>16PRISON OFFICER, ARMLEY LEEDS</title>
		<content> I live in Armley and work as a prison 
 officer in a prison built in 1847.    
 There are at present 1300 male        
 prisoners housed three to a cell. It  
 was intended that less than half that 
 number should be here. My duties are  
 to supervise the landings where there 
 are 46 cells, also to do court duties 
 that is escorting prisoners to Crown  
 and Magistrates' Courts. I normally   
 work days but have to do night shifts 
 every 10 weeks. The prisoners have    
 some work to do, mainly tailoring or  
 light engineering. No one has escaped 
 from the cells. The walls are very    
 thick and high. The cells contain a   
 bunk plus a single bed, a table and   
 chairs. They are heated in winter and 
 the walls are painted cream colour.   
 They measure 4m. long by 2m. wide     
 and are 2.5m. high.
