		<title>13Local History Warstones Area</title>
		<content>The Warstones estate was built by a    
firm called Mucklow whose motto was a  
house a day. The houses were built     
between 1936 and 1939. They are mainly 
semi-detached, and have had garages    
added since the Second World War.      
Before the estate was built there were 
just fields, streams and ponds in the  
area. There was also a farm called     
Bate's Farm which sold milk. The farm  
was where Hollybush Lane is now. The   
Hollybush Pub was built in 1946        
replacing an earlier one. The cost of a
house then would have been from about  
320 pounds to 400 pounds. The price of 
the same house today would be about    
21,000 pounds. Warstones Road used to  
be called Watery Lane because of the   
streams and ponds.
