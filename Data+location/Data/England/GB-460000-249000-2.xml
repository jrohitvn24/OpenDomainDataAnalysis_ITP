		<content>Blakesley school is a small school, one
part of which dates back to 1669, when 
it was Foxley Trust Boys School. In    
1913 two more classes were built and   
girls joined. Later, in 1974 a new     
school hall was built. There are about 
106 children today and 5 teachers. We  
have two cleaning ladies, a secretary  
and an ancillary who helps the         
teachers.The school is made up of a    
main building and two extra classrooms 
that used to be a canteen until the new
hall was built.You can have school     
dinners, bring sandwiches or go home   
for lunch.The school is well equiped   
with a modern computer and audio visual
aids.In a week, we get 25 hours of work
and 8.75hours of playtimes each week.My
best subjects are art and sport and we 
also do language,reading,mathematics,  
project and music.When we go home,we   
might go by bus or walk if we live near</content>
