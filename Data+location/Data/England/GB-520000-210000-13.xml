 Educational Sub Normal (_staff child

 The children in junior and infant     
 schools are taught in mixed ability   
 classes but are streamed into work    
 groups at the comprehensive           
 schools.All the schools within our    
 area are mixed boys and girls.There   
 are more women teachers than men      
 because women are attracted to        
 teaching the younger generation.A     
 school year includes{200}teaching days
 split into{3}terms.                   </content>
