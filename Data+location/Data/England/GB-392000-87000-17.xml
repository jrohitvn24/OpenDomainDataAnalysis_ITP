		<content> Bovis Homes are brick and mortar.They 
 are traditional built meaning there is
 not a timber frame.They do not build  
 timber frame houses as they are new   
 and have not proved anything.The dry  
 built houses have been given bad      
 publicity.They catch fire easily.     
 The traditional homes have proved more
 than these new dry built homes.The dry
 built homes are not more expensive,   
 than the traditional built homes nor  
 are they cheaper.One advantage in a   
 dry built home is the heating system  
 as it is further advanced it is also  
 cheaper to heat than traditional      
 homes.The people that tend to buy the 
 the houses are middle aged buisness   
 people.The average price is to be     
 approximately Â£70,000.The garden space
 is roughly a 100 square metres.
