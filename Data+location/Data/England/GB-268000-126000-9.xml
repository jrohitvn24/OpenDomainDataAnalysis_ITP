  Nowadays some people wear untidy     
 clothes like skin tight jeans with    
 belts hanging from them. Punks usually
 have bright coloured hair with        
 spikes. Other people wear nice and    
 fashionable clothes which are         
 ordinary. In South Molton today there 
 are 7 clothes shops.Most people       
 today buy their clothes in South      
 Molton or go to Barnstaple or         
 Exeter. We found some photographs of  
 some people in this area many years   
 ago.                                  
  Ladies wore long dresses. They only  
 had one or two sets of working clothes
 and one set of best clothes. They     
 mostly wore hats or scarves. On their 
 feet they wore ankle boots.           
  Men wore flares and caps. They only  
 had one or two sets of working clothes
 and one set of best clothes.          </content>
