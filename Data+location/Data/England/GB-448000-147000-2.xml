  EDUCATION IS VERY GOOD,WITH MATHS,   
 ENGLISH,HISTORY,SCIENCE AND GEOGRAPHY.
 AT THE SCHOOL I GO TO,THERE ARE 40    
 PUPILS, WHICH MAYBE SMALL,BUT THE     
 TEACHING IS STILL GOOD. WE DO OUR WORK
 IN GROUPS OR SINGLY.OUR DESKS ARE     
 PLACED IN A CLASSROOM.ENGLISH TODAY IS
 CALLED ENGLISH BECAUSE WE LIVE IN     
 ENGLAND.WHEN WE GET TO SECONDARY      
 SCHOOL WHICH COMES AFTER JUNIOR       
 SCHOOL,( THE SECONDRY SCHOOL IN       
 WHITCHURCH IS CALLED TEST-BOURNE      
 SCHOOL)THEY WILL HAVE MANY DIFFERENT  
 LESSONS LIKE HOME-ECONOMICS,DISCOVERY 
 AND WOOD AND PLASTIC WORK.THE WORK WE 
 DO IS SOMETIMES HARD BUT IT CAN BE    
 EASY AS WELL.WE DO A LOT MORE SUBJECTS
 TODAY THAN THE OLDEN DAYS.
