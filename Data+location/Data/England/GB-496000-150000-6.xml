		<title>06Family Life in N.W.Guildford</title>
		<content>    There are six people in my family, 
 Harold my dad who is 38, Joan my mum  
 who is 41, Stephen 14, myself 12,     
 Esther 9, Anna 5. We moved down to    
 Guildford from{South Shields}7 years  
 ago in 1978.                          
    We live in a semi-detached house   
 that was built about 1935. My dad was 
{unemployed}for a while but now works  
 for a building firm. My mum works     
 for an insurance company. My brother  
 wants to be a craftsman but I have no 
 ideas yet.                            
    Stephen and I go canoeing and      
 fishing. Sometimes I play tennis with 
 my dad and my sisters do ballet.      
    For holidays we go to South Shields
 to see my nan and grandad. Sometimes I
 go to a church camp. At weekends we   
 sometimes go out to picnics. On       
 Sundays we go to the Baptist church.
