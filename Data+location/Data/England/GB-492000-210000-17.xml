		<content> When an accident occurs you have to   
 check the cars to see if there is any 
 clue of what happened in the          
 accident.If someone has been burgled  
 the policeman gets there first and    
 asks the people who have been burgled 
 what has been taken.If there is a bad 
 crash the policman gets there first.  
 First he sees whether anybody is      
 hurt,then if they are hurt he has to  
  do first aid on them and take them to
 hospital.Then they have to safeguard  
 the site and look in the cars for     
 people's names and addresses.
