		<content>   If you looked down from the sky or  
 from a plane onto this area you would 
 see mainly fields,most of which are   
 green,but some are yellow.The green is
 grass,or not yet ripened wheat,oats or
 barley.The yellow fields contain oil  
 seed rape or ripe wheat,oats or       
 barley.                               
                                       
   As well as the fields,a bird's-eye  
 view would show that within the area  
 are several woods;Croft Wood,Dicky    
 Wood,Wild Wood,Thackmire Ash Wood,    
 Church Hill Wood,Conyers Spring Wood, 
 and Aikbargill Plantation.Some of     
 these woods belong to the Forestry    
 Commission but some belong to the     
 Wyvill estate.The wood,which is used  
 for firewood and Christmas trees,is a 
 mixture of both coniferous and        
 deciduous trees.
