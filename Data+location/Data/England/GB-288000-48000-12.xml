		<title>12The Coastguard</title>
		<content> There are two qualifications you need,
 to start to be a coastguard.Firstly   
 you must have been at sea for at least
 six years and a qualified navigator.  
 You also have to be quite good at     
 climbing and first aid.You must be    
 able to keep calm during terrifying   
 experiences.You must know what the    
 flares mean:a red flare means danger, 
 I'm in trouble.A white flare means:   
 Warning,your to close.You must be able
 to work a radio,and you go to school  
 for two weeks every year to learn     
 about the new equipment.You must be   
 able to swim quite a distance.Mr Pink 
 is our area coastgaurd.His area is    
 from Dittisham up the River Dart right
 around to Kingsbridge.One of Mr Pinks 
 funniest jobs was when he got a call  
 from somebody,saying that there was   
 a soldier trapped down a mine shaft,he
 found 7 soldiers and one policeman.   </content>
