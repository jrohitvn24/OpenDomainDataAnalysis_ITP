		<title>07The Village of Weston</title>
		<content> Weston-on-the-Green existed long      
 before the original Domesday Survey   
 was undertaken.  The{name}is Saxon in 
 origin and means village or homestead 
 to the west.  Parts of the village    
 green can still be seen: an old pair  
 of stocks gives some indication how   
 the green was used in former times.   
                                       
 Despite its position on the A43,      
 Weston is a pretty village, built     
 mainly of Cotswold Stone. Properties, 
 gardens and public amenities are well 
 kept.  Many{old houses}retain their   
{thatched roofs,}though most have been 
 extended indicating the modern need   
 for improved accommodation, garages,  
 etc.  Most{new houses}have been built 
 in reconstituted stone which blends   
 well with local stone. An exception is
 a group of{council houses}which seem  
 grey and rectangular in comparison.   </content>
