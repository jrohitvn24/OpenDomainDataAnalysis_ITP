		<title>20MOATS IN THE SAMPFORDS</title>
		<content> There are many moats in The Sampfords.
 There are more moats between Cambridge
 and Braintree than any where else in  
 the country.Nobody thinks that these  
 were used for defensive purposes.     
 Instead they were used to stop        
 livestock escaping from the farm and  
 for the livestocks drinking water.Also
 the moats could be used for washing   
 water for clothes and for             
 themselves.The water from the moats   
 could be used for many other domestic 
 purposes.The earth from the moat would
 be used for the banks.The moat also   
 enclosed the farm.There are two moats 
 in our rectangle,one is at Maynards   
 and the other is at Howses.Cattle     
 raiding was also popular and the moat 
 ensured that fewer people needed to   
 guard the cattle.{
