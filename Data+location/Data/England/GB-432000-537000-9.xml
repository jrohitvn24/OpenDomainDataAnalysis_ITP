		<title>09CASSOP VALE</title>
		<content> Cassop Vale is west of Cassop GR 3338.
 Stretching towards Durham is Cassop   
 Vale.It is a steep sided flat bottomed
 valley 2.5KM long and 500M wide.It has
 a pond known as The Bogs and is full  
 of wild flowers plants and animals and
 has interesting wildlife in it.The    
 name Cassop means the valley of the   
 chase (hunt).The Bishop of Durham used
 to hunt there.The hunt still goes on  
 today.The rock underneath the Vale is 
 magnesian limestone.It is an          
 escarpment.The valley was caused by   
 water during the ice age.When we go   
 down there we play games like hide and
 seek and tiggy.The different places in
 the vale have names too like the      
 Elephant's Cemetery,the Rockies,the   
 Witchy Wood and of course the         
 Bogs.People go fishing in the Bogs.In 
 the 1830's there were houses and pits 
 in the Vale,now it is countryside.    </content>
