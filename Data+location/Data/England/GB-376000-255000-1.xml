		<content>  Our Village Policeman has been in the
 Force for ten years and has been      
 stationed at Broadwas for eight years.
   When he was a boy he wanted to be an
 engine driver but when he grew up he  
 first joined the Royal Navy.When he   
 left the navy he did odd jobs for two 
 years before becoming a policeman.    
    The area he covers stretches       
 either side of the A44 from the       
 boundary of Worcester City going West 
 for a distance of eight miles to the  
 river bridge at Knightwick.This area  
 has a population of about 2700 people.
 When he is on duty he works seven days
 a week, usually for eight hours each  
 day but this depends very much on the 
 sort of things he is involved         
 in.During the day he has to deal with 
 road accidents,stolen vehicles,       
 thefts,burglaries,poachers,gypsies and
 once he even helped to deliver a baby.</content>
