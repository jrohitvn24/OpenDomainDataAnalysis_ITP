		<content> Berwick station on British Rail's     
 Southern Region south coast route     
 between Eastbourne and Lewes and      
 thence to Brighton or London, serves  
 twelve to fifteen surrounding         
 villages. It is manned part time but  
 is well kept with pretty hanging      
 flower baskets, part of the Beautiful 
 Britain scheme. Car parking is on both
 sides of the station and the Cuckmere 
 Community Buses park here. Apart from 
 one National Bus service these are the
 only means of public transport in the 
 area. Trains run hourly between 10am  
 and 4pm with two or three per hour at 
 peak periods. Commuters, students and 
 shoppers are the main users. There is 
 no newsagent in the village but papers
 are sold at the station by the staff. 
 The signal box and level crossing over
 the B2l08 are immediately adjacent.   
 A taxi service is available opposite. </content>
