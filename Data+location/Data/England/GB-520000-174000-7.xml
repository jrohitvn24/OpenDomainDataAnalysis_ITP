 Domesday Book and a fire in St.Mary's 
 Church in 1978 revealed a previously  
 concealed Norman doorway which dates  
 the church back to the 1100s. Rose    
 Cottage and Millbourne House are the  
 oldest houses, both close to the      
 village pond (first reference to a    
 Millbourne in the church - 1415).     
  Part of the manor of Wimbledon,      
 MORTLAKE did not have a church of its 
 own until Tudor times. The villagers  
 who farmed on what is now Richmond    
 Park used the chapel of the Archbishop
 of Canterbury's Palace (demolished    
 after the Reformation) where the      
 brewery now stands. A font, bearing   
 the arms of an Archbishop, stands in  
 St. Mary's. In 1619 the famous        
 Mortlake Tapestry works opened. They  
 later acquired the Raphael cartoons   
 for copying.                          </content>
