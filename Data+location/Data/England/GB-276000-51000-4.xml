		<content> The local pub at Moreleigh is called  
 The New Inn - it serves bar snacks and
 is well known for its steaks.  Bed and
 breakfast accommodation is available  
 at several houses in Moreleigh and the
 nearest Hotel is at Stanborough, which
 has accommodation for 14 guests.      
 There are two Caravan Club sites, each
 for five vans.                        
 Historically Moreleigh was more       
 important than today, but never       
 significantly so.  The name is spelt  
 variously Morlei (Domesday) Morley and
 today Moreleigh.  The road from Gara  
 Bridge is believed to be of Roman     
 origin.  In 1315 Moreleigh was granted
 a Charter for a market and a two day  
 Fair, to be held at the Festival of   
 Mary Magdalene.  Remains of a former  
 Manor House are at Place Barton.  In  
 the 16th Century Moreleigh was owned  
 by the Champernowne family.           </content>
