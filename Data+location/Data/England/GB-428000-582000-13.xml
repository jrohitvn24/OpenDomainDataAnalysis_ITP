		<content> Robinson Bros factory situated at West
 Sleekburn produces two chemicals.One  
 of them is a{drug}intermedial for     
 stomach ulcers and the other is a     
{rubber accelerator}to be added to     
 tyres.The firm employs 68 people of   
 both sexes.The main firm is situated  
 in West Bromich Albion and was        
 founded by three brothers.            
   They sell their products to other   
 companies such as Goodyear and other  
 tire manufacturers.The process for    
 making these products is very         
 complicated.First{hydrochloric acid}  
 must be boiled and condensed.Then     
 chemicals are added and put in        
 reaction tanks.They are mixed         
 thoroughly and dried into pellets     
 which are then ground into            
 powder.{Caustic soda}is also used in  
 the process.                          
                                       </content>
