		<title>01GENERAL OVERVIEW 1</title>
		<content> The area 3km North and 4km East of    
 Grid Ref. 05600189 is predominately   
 arable farmland. In the North is the  
 heavily wooded Thorndon Country Park, 
 and the Southern boundary is          
 approximately marked by the Southend  
 to London Arterial Road. The West is  
 bordered by grass and common land and 
 the Warley Park Golf Club, and to the 
 East is more arable farmland. The     
 Village of Ingrave and Herongate with 
 its  pleasant cricket green and two   
 Public Houses lies astride the North  
 West Corner. The land is gently and   
 pleasantly undulating. There are a    
 number of public paths leading to and 
 from the Country Park, providing      
 pleasurable and easy walks in a quiet 
 rural environment despite the close   
 proximity of Brentwood and a main     
 trunk road to London.
