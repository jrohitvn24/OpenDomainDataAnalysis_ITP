		<content> There is very little industry in      
 Yateley as it is in the commuter belt 
 and the majority of people work       
 outside the area. Land,as it becomes  
 available, is snapped up for private  
 housing. There is a fibre glass       
 factory (manufacturing pipes, boats   
 and horse boxes). A plastics factory  
 makes jacuzzi and baths. There is a   
 printing company and a precision      
 engineering firm.In addition on the   
 edge of the common are three scrap    
 metal companies.Two of these are car  
 breakers, also selling second hand car
 spares, but a third is a metal re-    
 processing plant (details on another  
 page).  Recently the building that    
 handled tractor production has been   
 demolished. Also in the grid are      
 cement and concrete works and a       
 plastic dipping firm (in Sandhurst).
