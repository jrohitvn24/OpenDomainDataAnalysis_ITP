		<title>11Chapel St.Leonards Fayre.</title>
		<content> Every July we have a Strawberry Fayre.
 There are lots of stalls and          
 raffles.Sometimes there are maypole   
 dances and morris dancers.Fancy dress 
 is another thing which takes place on 
 the day.Ther are games like throw the 
 wellington boots and tug of war.Every 
 year there is a fire engine parked at 
 the bottom of the field.There are     
 drawing competitions for those from   
 five years to eleven years old.The    
 police set up a four d special agent  
 where they give you a card to remind  
 you of things you must not do,like    
 going with strangers;and you get a    
 photograph aswell.This year we are    
 having a Summer Fayre,nineteen eighty 
 five,because the strawberrys were not 
 ripe so there were cream teas         
 instead.Tug of war matches are held   
 between the locals and the Black Horse
 club.                                 </content>
