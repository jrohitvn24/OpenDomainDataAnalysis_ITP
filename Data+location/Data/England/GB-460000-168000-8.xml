		<content> In the 1980's two groups would be     
 concerned with archaeological work in 
 the area: The Trust for Wessex        
 Archaeology and the Berkshire Field   
 Research Group. The former is a       
 professional organisation based in    
 Salisbury and one of its field        
 officers is particularly concerned    
 with the gravel area along the river  
 Kennet. The B.F.R.G. is an offshoot of
 the Berkshire Archaeological Society  
 and comprises interested amateurs who 
 dig at weekends. There are about a    
 dozen active workers in the group.    
 Should anything of archaeological     
 significance in the area be found to  
 be under threat, both organisations   
 would be informed and a rescue        
 excavation would be mounted. The main 
 threat in this area comes from the    
 excavation of gravel, whose importance
 commercially is paramount.            </content>
