		<content> The Southborough police are part of   
'D'Division of the Kent Constabulary.  
Our investigations found that their    
main concerns were the reduction of    
crime and the control of traffic       
especially in the busy local High      
Street. This year the officers have    
been very busy, travelling as far as   
Yorkshire and East Kent to deal with   
the miners' strike. This has put a lot 
of pressure on the officers left in the
local area.                            
 The main problems are traffic         
congestion and the constant worry over 
the increase in burglary and the low   
success rate in solving burglaries.Help
in this has been found in the use of   
neighbourhood watch schemes and the use
of computers for storing and analysing 
information. TVS and Crime Call on     
Radio Kent have also helped. The local 
police were very helpful and friendly. </content>
