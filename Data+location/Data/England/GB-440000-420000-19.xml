		<title>19Employment in Featherstone.</title>
		<content> Featherstone is part of the Castleford
 and Pontefract travel to work area.The
 whole area had a total unemployment   
 figure of 7719 on the 13th June 1985. 
 This was 13.3 percent and is almost   
 identical to the national figure of   
 13.4 percent.The unemployment figures 
 of the area have not usually varied   
 much from the national ones.          
 The major employer the Ackton Hall    
 colliery has just closed but most of  
 the men under 50years of age have been
 found work in other collieries nearby.
 Those over 50 have been offered early 
 retirement and redundancy.            
 The old miners welfare building has   
 been turned in to a centre for small  
 businesses usually one-man businesses.
 There are two sewing works employing  
 women,and a small engineering works.  
 There is little opportunity for youth.
