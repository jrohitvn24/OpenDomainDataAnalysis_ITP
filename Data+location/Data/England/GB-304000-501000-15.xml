		<title>15CHURCHES IN SEASCALE</title>
		<content> Seascale is mainly a Church of England
 village,but there are also people who 
 are Methodists,or Roman Catholics     
 or Jehovah's Witnesses.The Roman      
 Catholic Priest comes to our school   
 once a week to conduct a Catholic     
 service. The two boys who are         
 Jehovah's Witnesses don't have a      
 service at school.                    
  The Church of England is called      
 St.Cuthberts.It was built in 1894     
 when the corrugated iron church blew  
 down. There is a  Methodist church and
 a Roman Catholic church.Most people go
 to the Church of England on Sunday.   
 The Guides have a Church Parade once a
 fortnight at the two Protestant       
 churches.There are two services on    
 Sunday,and a Sunday school for        
 children at St.Cuthberts and the      
 Chapel.
