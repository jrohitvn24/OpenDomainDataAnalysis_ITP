		<content>   The main urban area to the east of  
 the A19 includes the outer suburbs of 
 Sunderland. A mixture of housing      
 exists from the older established     
 semi-rural village of East Herrington 
 to the mixed council and private      
 housing of Grindon, the former being  
 built immediately post war and the    
 latter from the 1960's onwards.       
   The small villages to the west lie  
 equidistant from the larger towns of  
 Sunderland, Washington and Houghton-le
 -Spring and have grown together over  
 the years to form a small hub of urban
 settlement.All but Penshaw owe their  
 origin to "King Coal" and the         
 Industrial Revolution.                
   Today there can be seen one of the  
 last remaining deep coalmines on the  
 Durham Coalfield at Herrington and the
 remains of older long since dissused  
 pits can still be found in this area. </content>
