		<title>13LANDSCAPE AROUND CHAGFORD</title>
		<content> Most of the land around Chagford is { 
{grassy fields.}The other fields grow  
 crops .Some of the land is{woodland } 
 and some is{open moorland. }The{River 
{Teign}flows through parts of Chagford 
 and there are two very old, narrow    
 bridges over it. In the immediate     
 vicinity of Chagford are{Meldon and   
{Nattadon hills,}from both of which    
 there are the most magnificent views. 
 Most of the roads are narrow with high
 hedges on each side, and behind the   
 greenery are{granite walls,}not really
 obvious to the unwary visitor. There  
 are lots of streams flowing through   
 the fields, and the moor is covered in
{rocks, heather, ferns, bracken and    
{gorse,}from which Chagford gets its   
 name. It is on account of its setting 
 in beautiful landscape that Chagford  
 receives so many British and Foreign  
 visitors.                             </content>
