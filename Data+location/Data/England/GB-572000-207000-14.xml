		<content>    There are eight bays in the school.
 Each one has a sink and an art area.  
 The rooms are mostly covered in green 
 carpet.We have a big courtyard in the 
 centre of the school which is opened  
 in the summer time.It is split into   
 two sections.Each section has a patch 
 of artificial grass.We have a big hall
 which has a badminton court marked on 
 the floor.We have bars and ropes      
 which are attached to the  wall.When  
 the lights are switched on they start 
 off dull and they appear to creep up  
 to the roof getting brighter.We have  
 quiet rooms,a music room,a library and
 an A.V.A room.There is a headmaster's 
 room,a secretary's room and a staff   
 room.We have two changing rooms with  
 showers and toilets.
