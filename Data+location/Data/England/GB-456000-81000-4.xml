		<content> Most of the children in our area      
 live in Shanklin and come from a two  
 parent family.                        
 Most parents have two or more children
 in their family and a pet of          
 some kind.                            
 Many mothers have seasonal jobs during
 the Summer and most fathers work all  
 the year round.                       
 School children either walk or cycle  
 to school and half have school        
 dinners.School children have mostly   
 cooked meals when they arrive home    
 from school(some eat theirs in the    
 evening).50% of children do their     
 homework before watching television.  
 Children go to bed at around 9-10pm.  
 Most mothers do the housework and     
 cooking.Few children go to church with
 their parents on Sundays.Most parents 
 don't work on Sundays.
