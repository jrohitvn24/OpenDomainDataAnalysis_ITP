		<title>13Local Ghost Stories</title>
		<content> There are three local ghost stories.  
 The first is known as the Grey Lady   
 and is a ghost believed to come from  
 Morley Old Hall and roam the area on  
 certain nights, particularly the      
 eleventh day of the eleventh month.   
 The second is supposed to be the ghost
 of a maidservant from Morley Hall who 
 drowned herself in a pond in the      
 grounds when she found herself to be  
 pregnant. The third is more recent and
 is supposed to be the ghost of an     
 American airman who committed suicide 
 while at the hospital during the      
 second World War. All the stories are 
 greatly enjoyed by pupils at the      
 College, especially on dark nights!
