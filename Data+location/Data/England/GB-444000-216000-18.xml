		<title>18SHIPTON CEMENT WORKS</title>
		<content>  The limestone is taken out of the    
ground by 2 bucket diggers, 3 dumper   
trucks, and a conveyor belt after      
blasting with ammonium nitrate         
explosives, inserted by a mobile drill.
  The clay and limestone are crushed   
and watered to form a paste which is   
mixed together in a 4,000 ton slurry   
tank. The mixture is then poured into  
a 200 foot rotating kiln where it is   
dried by the 12 foot gas flame which   
heats the kiln to 2,160 degrees        
centigrade. Two feet of firebrick      
insulate the kiln. The steam is sent up
the chimney which is a local landmark. 
The dried cement is mixed with gypsum  
in a ball mill containing 80 ton balls.
It is then taken to one of the 62,000  
ton silos or to a barn which can hold  
10,000 tons. It is then loaded on to   
lorries or sent out by train. A new    
12,000,000 pound factory is planned.   </content>
