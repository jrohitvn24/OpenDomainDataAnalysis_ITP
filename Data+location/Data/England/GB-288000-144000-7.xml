		<title>07THE GAME OF SKITTLES</title>
		<content>                                       
 The game of Skittles is a bit like    
 ten pin bowling.You have a heavy      
 wooden ball and nine pins(large wooden
 stumps).the idea of the game is to    
 knock down as many as possible.In the 
 centre of the set of pins is alarger  
 pin called the{Kingpin.}At one end of 
 the{Skittle Alley }(name given to the 
 runway where you roll the ball along) 
 is a large metal strip.When you bowl  
 you have to make sure that the ball   
 pitches onto this metal strip.You have
 3 balls against nine pins and this is 
 called a{"hand"}and for every pin     
 knocked down you score a point.If you 
 knock down all nine pins with one ball
 it is called a{"flopper"}and you earn 
 an extra ball.Teams compete in Skittle
 Leagues.Most alleys are in pubs and   
 clubs and both men and women play.
