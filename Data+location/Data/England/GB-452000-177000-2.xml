		<title>02Tree Planting Ceremony</title>
		<content> On October 24th 1985 at 2.45 we       
 planted a tree,donated by Fairfield   
 Nurseries because we took part in a   
 drawing competition and quiz.It was an
 elm tree,to help replace those which  
 were killed by Dutch Elm disease a few
 years back.The tree was approximately 
 three metres tall.Henry Deeds and     
 Richard Priestly wrote an invitation  
 asking Mr Chrichton-Miller to plant   
 the tree.  The youngest child in the  
 school ,Louise Carter ,was chosen to  
 take handfuls of compost and put it   
 around the roots.She will be able to  
 watch it grow for the longest time.All
 the classes gathered around to watch  
 while this was happening.Then we put a
 strong stick into the ground and tied 
 the tree to it with fabric because    
 string would have cut into the young  
 trunk.                                
                                       </content>
