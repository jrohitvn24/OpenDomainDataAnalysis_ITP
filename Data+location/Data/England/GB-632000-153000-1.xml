		<title>01THE AREA AROUND HACKLINGE</title>
		<content> The Hacklinge area is between         
 Sandwich in the north and Northbourne 
 in the south,Eastry is to the west and
 the sea at Sandwich Bay to the east.  
 It lies on part of the Kent coalfield.
 Shafts from the mine at Betteshanger  
 in the southwest fan out under the    
 area. The Sandwich-Deal road cuts     
 across from northwest to southeast and
 the Southern Railway line traverses   
 the northeast corner. A track built to
 take coal from the pit to the main    
 line is evident but unused, the coal  
 is now taken by lorry along roads     
 unfit for such vehicles. The largest  
 populated areas are in Finglesham and 
 the mining community at the pit       
 head.The main surface industry is     
 farming but most of the land is worked
 by farmers living outside the area.
