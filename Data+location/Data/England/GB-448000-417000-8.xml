		<title>08COACHING DAYS-WENT HILLS.</title>
		<content>    Wentbridge was disliked by the     
 coachmen who had to drive their       
 coaches through what was called the   
 worst stretch of road along the A1.   
   The approach from both north and    
 south were very difficult, with steep 
 descents followed immediately by a    
 stiff climb. It was a place where     
 accidents happened quite frequently.  
    Eventually a cutting was made      
 through the limestone to improve the  
 road and make it safer. Just as this  
 was finished, the railways took over  
 as the main form of transport, and the
 coaching trade, with its many         
 visitors, both welcome and unwelcome, 
 ceased to pass through the village.   
    Another important group of         
 travellers who passed through were the
 drovers. The Gate Inn had enough      
 grazing for up to 700 head of cattle, 
 as well as room for 50 men and horses.</content>
