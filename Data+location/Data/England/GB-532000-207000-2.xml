		<title>02BRICKENDON VILLAGE</title>
		<content> In a rural setting,Brickendon is a    
 village with crossroads,a Green and   
 The Farmer's Boy public house at the  
 centre.The church and many older      
 picturesque houses stand along        
 Brickendon Lane and around the        
 Green,also many pre and post-war      
 houses.Despite very limited amenities 
 house prices rise steadily as the area
 is very popular,best known for the    
 nearby golf course.Many residents     
 commute to London and Hertford via    
 Bayford,the nearest railway station.  
 The bus service(Hertford-Cuffley)runs 
 3 times daily.Children attend primary 
 school at Bayford but travel further  
 by school buses for secondary         
 education.It is 3 miles to Hertford   
 for the nearest shopping centre,for   
 petrol,doctors surgeries and hospital.
 Local housewives regret the closing of
 the one village shop 8 years ago!     </content>
