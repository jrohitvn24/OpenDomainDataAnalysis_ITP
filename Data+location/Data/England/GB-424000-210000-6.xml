800 acres in size. They are worked by  
family members and or two farm workers.

workers in tied cottages.The busiest   
times of the year are June for         
haymaking, July and August for the     
harvest and seed drilling in September 
and October.A dairy herd of 50 Friesian
cattle and a flock of 250 sheep are    
usual.Sheep include Hampshire and      
Suffolk Cross breeds and around 100    
lambs are born in February.Cattle eat  
kale and rye;sheep eat swedes and kale.
Corn is sold to a grain merchant.Each  
farm is highly mechanized with         
tractors,a combine harvester,drill,    
cultivator,muck spreader, elevator and 
a fork lift.
