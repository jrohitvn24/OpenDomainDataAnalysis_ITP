		<title>02  HIGHAM STATION</title>
		<content> Higham Station was built in about     
 1876. the station is used particularly
 by commuters who work in London and   
 shoppers who travel to Gravesend and  
 the Medway Towns. As well as passenger
 trains many goods trains pass the     
 station with coal from the Kent       
 coalfields and oil going ti Kingsnorth
 power station on the Isle of Grain.   
  The station is run by only one man   
 who is responsible for everything. In 
 the morning and evening rush hours 300
 to 400 people use the station. The    
 station has recently become a lot     
 busier.                               
  Next to the station is the beginning 
 of a 4 mile long tunnel which is      
 thought to be one of the oldest in the
 country. The tunnel was once a canal  
 carrying barges to the Isle of Grain.
