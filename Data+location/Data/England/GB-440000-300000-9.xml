		<content> Again as in most small rural          
 communities the church is the focal   
 point of social activity.             
                                       
 The church in addition to the more    
 orthodox spiritual services, provides,
 through the auspices of the nearby    
 Church Hall, a catalyst for both the  
 Senior Citizens Club, which meets once
 every week and the Womens Institute   
 which meets once every month.         
                                       
 The Atherstone Hunt meets at Sutton   
 Cheney twice each year.               
                                       
 The Greyhound and Hercules Inns, by   
 virtue of their use as meeting        
 places, form an integral part of the  
 local communication network.
