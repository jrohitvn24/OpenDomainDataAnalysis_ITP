 THROUGH THE FAVERDALE HOUSING ESTATE  
 PRODUCED AN INTERESTING CONTRAST.THE  
 FIRST STREAM WE EXAMINED ENTERED  THE 
 HOUSING ESTATE AFTER PASSING THROUGH  
 THE GROUNDS OF THE CHEMICAL           
 WORKS.AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO FIND  
 LIFE IN THIS STREAM WE FOUND IT HAD NO
 LIFE WHAT SO EVER LIVING IN IT.       
 THIS INDICATED TO US THAT IT WAS SO   
 POLLUTED THAT NOTHING COULD LIVE IN   
 IT.WE THEN EXAMINED ANOTHER STREAM    
 RUNNING ALONG THE EDGE OF THE ESTATE  
 WHICH RAN INTO THE ESTATE FROM THE    
 COUNTRYSIDE.WE DID FIND SOME LIFE IN  
 THIS STREAM AND APPLIED THE FOLLOWING 
 GUIDE TO SEE HOW POLLUTED IT WAS.     
 THESE CREATURES BEING INDICATORS OF   
 LEVELS OF POLLUTION.NO LIFE-COMPLETELY
 POLLUTED RAT-TAILED MAGGOT OR SLUDGE
