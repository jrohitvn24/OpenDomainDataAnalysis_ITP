		<content> We walked Southwards to a T-junction  
 and turned right passing two farms.The
 Meadows and Greystones.We came to a   
 grey gate which was set back off the  
 road and on to a dirt track.We walked 
 passed four large oak trees and came  
 to a field growing barley which was   
 about four feet tall.We walked along a
 path at the side of the field and came
 to a field of cows.The next field was 
 growing grass.We walked through it and
 turned right into a large field which 
 had a herd of cattle in it.We walked  
 down towards a fence which we climbed 
 over into another field of barley     
 which was about three feet tall.The   
 ground was surprisingly very boggy.
