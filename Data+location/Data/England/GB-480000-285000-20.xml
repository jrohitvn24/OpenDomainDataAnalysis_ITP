   Pipewell Manor is a very large house
built in large, landscaped gardens. The
main part of the house was probably    
built in the 16th century. Two wings   
were later added in 1864 and 1949. Mr. 
and Mrs. Lloyd live there alone now.   
The manor has about 11 chimneys, and   
there are lots of statues in the       
garden as well. Under the trees there  
are dogs' graves. There is also a      
private swimming pool and an old       
tennis court. The Manor has patterned  
windows, and wisteria and roses grow   
up the front. The Manor has some old   
stables. At the front there is a stone 
porch. Until 4 years ago beagles were  
bred at the Manor. Now Mr. Lloyd makes 
guns to sell. Part of the old house is 
being renovated for people to live     
there.
