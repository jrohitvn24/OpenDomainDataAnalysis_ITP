		<title>15Newcastle Guildhall</title>
		<content>Newcastle Guildhall was built by an    
employers association in about 1235.It 
was then that Henry III recognised that
Necastle was more than an ordinary     
market town and so granted the Townsman
the right to form a Gild Merchant.They 
quickly became the most powerful       
force,both economically and            
politically,in Newcastle.Later on when 
a town council emerged to administer   
the town the Gild became less          
important,but in a continuing memorial 
the Town CouncilÂ£s meeting place has   
continued to  be called a Guildhall    
rather than a Town Hall.The Guildhall  
today, which is a little to the south  
of the original site,is used for many  
functions.Various organisations hire it
for many things from Jumble Sales to   
plays.Whatever its many uses today it  
is still a beautiful building which    
dominates the Newcastle Market Square. </content>
