		<title>19LIFESTYLES WOLSTANTON.</title>
		<content>  Overall young people enjoy living in 
Wolstanton,although there is little to 
do to occupy recreaation time in bad   
weather.The amount of play areas and   
grass surfaces was felt tobe good for  
young people.The number of slides      
swings,roundabouts etc.was most        
satisfactory.A small sports complex    
would be very much appreciated,and well
used.With regard to shopping facilities
it was felt that for general provisions
meat,fruit and chemists there was a    
large choice but for sports/hobbies,   
records and books Wolstanton is sadly  
lacking.Also considering the number of 
young people who posses B.M.X.bikes  a 
track would be a useful addition.One   
final facility which could prove       
benefical is a well run youth-club for 
the 9-14 age group.
