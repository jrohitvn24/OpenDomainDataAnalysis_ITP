		<content> Esh Winning is about 6 miles from     
 Durham City on the B6302 road.The     
 approximate population of our village 
 is 3000.The biggest population is the 
 59 to 64 group.The population is not  
 increasing.                           
   In the years past there were very   
 few shops in Esh winning but          
 throughout the years they have grown  
 and now they form a popular little    
 village.In one part of the village    
 there is a cafe and it is also a      
 video shop.Upstairs are amusements,   
 snooker tables and pool tables.The    
 swings are next to the BMX track which
 is very popular.There is a bingo for  
 grown ups.The organised activity for  
 juniors is the youth club and the     
 Community Centre.                     
    The library is very good because   
 you can take as many books as you like
 and you can go there to be alone.     </content>
