		<title>05FARMING ON BROADLANDS ESTATE</title>
		<content>  Broadlands Farm is situated south of 
 Romsey,to the east of the river       
 Test.It is the largest farm on the    
 Broadlands Estate and includes land   
 outside the area.The farm has a       
 manager who looks after it for the    
 owner,Lord Romsey.It has been in the  
 same family for a long time.          
  The farm is 1000ha,which is very     
 large.Over the last few years it has  
 been enlarged by 200ha:the largest    
 field is 40ha and is a mile long, the 
 smallest is a hectare.The boundaries  
 of the field are wooded so that the   
 appearance of the land is not spoilt. 
 Farming is mixed with some arable and 
 some dairying.                        
  There are twenty people working and  
 living on the farm,in the farmhouses  
 and cottages.The farm has a lot of    
 modern equipment and machinery.
