		<content> The Village of Claerley is dominated  
 by the Norman and medieval Church,    
 built from local red sandstone. Time  
 has not changed the centre of the     
 village greatly, which still retains  
 many charming old timber framed, black
 and white buildings.  From the bull   
 Ring, climbing the left side of Hight 
 street, are the three village pubs,   
 fondly referred to by the locals as   
 the bottom, the middle and the top.   
 Nearby, a few housing developments    
 have been built.  One by the Council  
 in 1955 and several by commercial     
 builders during the 1960's and since. 
 Most occupants of the latter commute  
 daily to surrounding towns.  The area 
 to the south and west contains        
 Beobridge, Farmcote, Upper Farmcote,  
 Sandford, Woundale and Chyknell, all  
 local employment.
