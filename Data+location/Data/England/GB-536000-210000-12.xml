 A large roundabout is the centre of   
{road TRANSPORT}in square six, having  
 3 major roads leading from it.        
 There is a network of minor roads     
 around a housing estate, the latter,  
 council-built mostly in 1947, being   
 the main{HOUSING}in St. Margarets. The
 A414 runs east into Stanstead Abbotts,
 with shops and some housing along it  
 although most of the housing lies     
 further through the village on a low- 
 level plateau. This includes neo-     
 Georgian detached houses with well-to-
 do residents. Some housing follows the
 River Lea out of the village. A by-   
 pass is under construction which will 
 alleviate congestion in the village   
 and provide a trouble-free link to the
 A10.
