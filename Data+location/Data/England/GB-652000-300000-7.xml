 boots &amp; shoes with straight straps    
 across. People did not wear training  
 shoes but wore plimsoles &amp; sandals.   
 They wore no trousers or tight skirts 
 for ladies, while gentlemen wore thick
 long-sleeved shirts &amp; knee-length     
 shorts or "Oxford bags".              
   Most girls had their hair long in   
 plaits or tied back. Boys had the     
 style called "Eton Crop "from the way 
 the students at the college had their 
 hair cut .                            
   Females wore rayon or lyle stockings
 &amp; the rich had silk stockings. Tights 
 were only worn by theatrical people .A
 few girls wore hats.
