		<content> We visited{Swallows Court Old Peoples 
{Home.}It overlooks a big, green       
 expanse where children play. There is 
 accomodation for 64 senior citizens   
 from the age of 60 years old who can  
 no longer look after themselves..     
 They are encouraged to do as much as  
 they can for themselves. There is     
 also a day centre for more active     
 local senior citizens. About 20 come  
 each day for a meal and to take part  
 in various activities.                
      We interviewed several old people
 about the changes they have seen in   
 the area. One lady told us that       
 Blossomfield road used to be a lane   
 surrounded by farm land owned by Sir  
 Alfred Bird.Shirley was just a village
 then. Schools such as Alderbrook and  
 Tudor Grange were built on fields and 
 most of the original farm buildings   
 were demolished.                      </content>
