		<content> Our school is Hamsteels Primary.We    
 learn together.We play inside and     
 outside together.Outside we play      
 hopscotch,cat and mouse,netball and   
 the boys play football and cricket.   
 We all work together in the same      
 building.Some of our school meals are 
 nice but others are not.It would be   
 better if the heating was on when it  
 is cold I like reading books at       
 school.We do many interesting         
 subjects at school.All the staff in   
 the school are kind and help us when  
 we are in trouble.Our headteacher is  
 Mr.Roberts.I like P.E.,gymnastics and 
 maths.I also like going to Esh        
 Winning library.I do not like goimg   
 out to play when it is freezing.Our   
 day starts at 9 o,clock and we finish 
 at 3.15.Our dinner only lasts for 45  
 minutes I wish it was longer.l
