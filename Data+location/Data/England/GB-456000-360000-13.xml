		<content>      The traffic that flows through   
 Forest Town is mostly lorries and     
 vans. Most of the lorries are from the
 coal industry and are going to        
 Nottingham or Mansfield. Buses use    
 this route regularly to go to         
 Clipstone and Mansfield Woodhouse.    
 Other lorries that use this route are 
 furniture, timber and gravel lorries, 
 milk floats and rubbish skips.        
      The road from Clipstone and Old  
 Mill Lane are used most for coming in 
 and out of town. These roads are very 
 important because they are the outer  
 ring roads of Mansfield.              
      There are quite a few county     
 council vans as well, probably for all
 the new housing estates. Most of the  
 lorries are food lorries going into   
 town with things like bread and       
 chocolate.
