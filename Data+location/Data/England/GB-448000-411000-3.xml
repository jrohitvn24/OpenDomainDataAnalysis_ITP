		<title>03Life In Skelbrooke.</title>
		<content> Skelbrooke is a small village situated
 at the side of the Great North Road,  
 known as the A1. The village is{very  
{small with not much life.}Most of the 
 villagers come from Askern and one    
 from a place called Castle Donnington 
 in Leicester.Hardly any of them work  
 because they are{elderly and retired. 
 Nearly all of the villagers have a car
 to go shopping at{Carcroft}because    
 there{are no shops}in Skelbrooke.     
 Those we interviewed told us they did 
 a lot of sport in their leisure time  
 such as{golf, swimming, sailing and   
{squash.                               
   The people around Skelbrooke have   
 always had a fairly good community    
 spirit as we found out when we        
 interviewed them. Around Skelbrooke is
 a{Green Belt}so there are no further  
 plans for development in the future.
