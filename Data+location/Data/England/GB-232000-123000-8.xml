		<content> Most of the dwellings in the block are
 old,some from Victorian times and some
 much earlier.There are two bungalows  
 at West Bucks,one built recently and  
 the other in 1938.There are two       
 farmhouses with adjacent farm         
 buildings,barns and shippons. Most of 
 the other dwellings are cottages each 
 with its own garden.In the Clovelly   
 part there are three lodges.London    
 Lodge,which is two houses joined by a 
 central arch,and Hobby Lodge,a        
 bungalow at the entrance to Hobby     
 Drive. Many families have a television
 set and a telephone,and some a video  
 recorder and music centre.Many        
 households have either a cat or a dog 
 or both for pets.The main meal of the 
 day is often in the evening,following 
 breakfast of cereal and toast and a   
 light lunch.
