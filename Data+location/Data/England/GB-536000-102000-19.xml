		<title>19A HOLIDAY IN ROTTINGDEAN</title>

 The visitor has a wide choice of      
 accommodation from the humble Bed and 
 Breakfast and pleasant guest houses to
 the relative luxury of the White Horse
 Hotel adjacent to the beach.  It is   
 best to rise fairly early and enjoy   
 the relative quiet of the High Street 
 with its residents going about their  
 daily business. Low tides bring out   
 the beachcomber in us all.  Sunny days
 invite the sunbather and swimmer. But 
 when strong winds blow the scene is   
 most dramatic. Waves blow on to the   
 coast and the unknowing visitor will  
 easily become soaked with sea spray.  
 Gift shops provide the opportunity to 
 delight one's relatives and remind one
 of happy days by the Sussex coast.
