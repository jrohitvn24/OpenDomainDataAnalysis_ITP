		<title>14   Abbots Court Farm.</title>
		<content>       The farm is 750 acres in        
 Winterborne Kingston. It got its name 
 because an abbot used to live there.  
 When he died he was buried inside the 
 village church. The farm grows three  
 kinds of cereal crops wheat,barley and
 oats which are harvested in the       
 summer. There is a computerised dairy 
 with about 140 cows which are milked  
 twice a day by Mike Downes. Other     
 people working there are my dad,Dave  
 who is the manager,Simon, our next    
 door neighbour and ,Andrew, the       
 student. My dad has a very big Ford   
 tractor B registration. He has worked 
 at Abbots Court Farm since he was     
 thirteen. He used to plough with      
 horses when he first went to work     
 there. There are no sheep or pigs.
