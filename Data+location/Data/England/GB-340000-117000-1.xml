		<content> Most of the buildings in Shepton      
 Beauchamp and the surrounding villages
 are built from the warm coloured local
 stone. Many of the houses are very old
 and have been modernised.             
 In the past the farms in this area    
 have been mixed but these days most of
 the fertile land is used for fruit and
 vegetable growing especially as the   
 sandy soil drains quickly helping at  
 harvest time.                         
 There are still some local families   
 living in the area but many people    
 have moved here in the last ten or    
 twenty years.
