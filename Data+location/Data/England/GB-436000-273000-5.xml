		<content>  The farmland within the area is      
 divided into two broad areas;         
{ 1)The water meadows along the river  
{Avon.}This area is devoted entirely   
 to pasture. Cattle, both dairy and    
 beef are reared. Many{horses}are also 
 stabled on this land for owners who   
 live in Coventry. Most of the pasture 
 is unimproved grassland.              
{ 2)The higher, dryer land that is     
{highly cultivated arable land.}Crops  
 include; cereals, oil seed rape,      
 potatoes and fodder crops. About two  
 thirds of the farmland is arable.     
  The land is intensively worked at the
 Brandon Lane Fruit Farm, this is well 
 situated close to Coventry, on dryer  
 south facing land.                    
  Farmers in the north of the area     
 complain of the nuisance from         
 "Townies" who wander over the land,   
 leave litter and annoy animals.       </content>
