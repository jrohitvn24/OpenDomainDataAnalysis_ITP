		<title>07Highworth's Adults Clubs.</title>
		<content> On Tuesday in the community hut they  
 have a society for old people. They   
 have coffee, chats and lunch. They    
 really enjoy it. They go to other     
 clubs in the area as well, and have   
 Bingo. We questioned people aged 18   
 to about 95. These were their answers:
 Clay centre, silver threads,British   
 Legion, swimming, womens institute,   
 luncheons, golf, badminton, Methodists
 sisterhood, Lions club, tennis and    
 recreation.We found out a lot of      
 information about these clubs. We     
 found more older people went to clubs 
 than the younger people.              
 Although Highworth has many clubs for 
 adults, a lot of people travel into   
 Swindon for clubs and recreation.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
