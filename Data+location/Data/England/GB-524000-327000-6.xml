		<content>     The firm was started just after   
 the Second World War by myself,{George
{Parker,}and my brother F.W.Parker, who
 is now deceased.   We bought three    
 lorries from a firm of two partners   
 who were retiring.                    
     Over the years I have built the   
 fleet of vehicles. In 1969 we formed a
 limited company  with myself and my   
 son, Roger Parker, as directors.      
     Our operation is mainly giving a  
 service to the growers of agricultural
 and horticultural produce  and        
 requisites in the South Lincolnshire  
 area.  We deliver to wholesale markets
 all over the country, including places
 as far apart as South Wales and       
 Scotland.                             
     We are also prepared to do haulage
 of a general nature whenever required 
 to do so.   Our distinctive green and 
 mauve lorries are seen everywhere.    </content>
