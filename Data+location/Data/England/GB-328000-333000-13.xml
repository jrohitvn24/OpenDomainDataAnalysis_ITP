		<title>13GOBOWEN VILLAGER REMEMBERS</title>
		<content>{Mrs Watt}has lived in Gobowen village 
 for 70 years. She{remembers}the fox   
 hunt meeting outside a house which is 
 now the post office. There used to be 
 a good quality grocer's,baker,        
 watchmaker and a co-operative store in
 Brook Buildings. The{village changed  
 when the A5 road was re-routed to a   
 by-pass in the 1950's and now this is 
 having to be replaced. Work on a new  
 by-pass started in June 1985.         
   Mrs Watt remembers (1944) American  
 troups stationed at nearby Halston    
 Hall and as Oswestry was 'out of      
 bounds'they came to local public      
 houses and the dance hall. Her own    
 house was once a butcher's slaughter  
 house. People alighting trains at the 
 station were carried by horse and trap
 to the Ortopaedic Hospital or Park    
 Hall army camp which is now closed    
 down.                                 </content>
