		<title>11Industry in Corby</title>
		<content>Hunters Food factory is on the Corby   
enterprise zone and was built in 1981  
and cost over 3 million pounds.Most of 
their production is geared to the      
making of potato crisps.The factory is 
one of the most modern crisp factories 
in Europe.Corby was chosen by Hunters  
because of its central position and    
financial incentives offered.The       
factory originally employed 300 workers
but in 1985 they completed a 1.25      
million extension which created 100    
jobs.The factory was launched by       
Minister Peter Walker in July 1981.The 
firm now claim to have captured 4% of  
the British snack market and produce   
about 7 million packets of crisps per  
week. The crisp manufacturers are well 
represented in Corby as the town also  
houses production plants belonging to  
Golden Wonder and Smiths crisps.
