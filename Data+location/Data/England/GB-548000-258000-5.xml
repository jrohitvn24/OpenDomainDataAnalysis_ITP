		<content> TEVERSHAM CHURCH                      
 The church at Teversham stands on the 
 outskirts of the village, towards the 
 north-west.                           
   The church  stands in the place of  
 one which was founded by a man who    
 fell fighting the Danes. The walls are
 of field stones, flint and clunch.    
 (Clunch is a locally quarried chalk   
 which was cut into blocks) Many       
 churches, walls and old houses are    
 made of this.                         
 Teversham was first inhabited by      
 Saxons at the time St. Etheldreda was 
 starting her life as a nun. It is     
 mentioned in the Domesday Book and the
 land was owned by the Abbey of Ely.   
 The Bishop of Ely is still the Patron 
 of the benefice.
