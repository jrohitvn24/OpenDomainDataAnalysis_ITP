		<content>   On the 4th of June 1985 I got out of
 bed about 8.00 clock. It was about 25 
 minutes to 9 when my brother and I    
 left for school.                      
   We have to walk about 200 yards.    
 Then about 9.00 clock the bell rang   
 - that told us that we had to go and  
 sit down. Then Sir called out the     
 register before assembly. After       
 assembly we had to go on the carpet in
 the library area to read.             
   After we had read we had to do      
 crossword puzzles or "Springboard"    
 workbooks until half past 10. Then we 
 went out to play for fifteen minutes. 
   When we came in we did Maths until  
 lunch. After lunch we worked in groups
 on three huge dragon pictures that we 
 are making from coloured paper and    
 tin-foil. We went swimming and played 
 rounders before going home.
