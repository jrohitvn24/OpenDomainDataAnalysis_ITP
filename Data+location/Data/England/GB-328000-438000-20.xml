		<content> The North Shore Golf Club covers 94   
 acres of our grid section. It is very 
 popular with local people, as well as 
 with holiday visitors, who are very   
 welcome to play.                      
  The Club has 510 golfing members, and
 300 social, junior and country        
 members. The course has 18 holes and  
 is 6,400 yards long. The present      
 clubhouse was opened in 1928, but     
 before that the clubhouse was what    
 is now the Deaf and Dumb Institute in 
 Cornwall Avenue nearby.               
 In 1963, the Duke of Edinburgh came by
 helicopter to the golf club; his visit
 was to launch an international golfing
 competition which was held to raise   
 money for the Playing Fields          
 Association.                          
 Other sporting amenities in the area  
 include bowling greens, tennis courts,
 putting greens and a boating pool.    </content>
