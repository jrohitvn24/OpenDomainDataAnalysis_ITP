		<title>14MALVERN FIRESTATION</title>
		<content> The new Malvern firestation was       
 completed in 1985.On average they have
 about 350 fires a year.They employ 7  
 full-time workers and 15 part-time.The
 fireman in charge did not think it was
 a dangerous job because they have a   
 strict routine and various safety     
 checks.He enjoys his job a lot but it 
 is not an easy job.At the Malvern     
 firestation they have four            
 fire-engines.If we had a fire at      
 Malvern Link Junior School we would   
 call them and it would take them about
 a minute to 2 minutes to reach us.Most
 of the fires occur during the day but 
 the serious ones are night.In the     
 summer most of the fires are grass    
 fires.To build the firestation it cost
 about 3 quartes of a million pounds   
 and was designed to blend in with the 
 hills.
