		<content>{(A)PUBLIC HOUSES.                     
{                  First of all        
{there were 2 pubs in the village in   
{Garvestone. They were opposite each   
{other but now there is one. It is     
{called "The King's Arms" and the      
{owners are Mr. and Mrs. Smith.There   
{are two main bars and a middle bar.   
{They have a ladies' darts team and a  
{men's darts team. They play darts     
{every Friday and they have a Pool     
{table.My dad is the captain of the    
{darts team.                           
                                       
 (B) SUPERNATURAL.                     
                    I saw a ghost.     
 I thought it was Mrs Saddler who lived
 in the house before me and died there.
 The bedroom that I sleep in now used  
 to be Mrs Saddler's room. My aunt Rita
 and I saw her.She was a silver lady.
