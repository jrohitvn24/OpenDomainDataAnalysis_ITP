		<title>04NORTHAM CHURCH</title>
		<content> St Margaret's Parish Church was opened
 on 1 June 1593. In 1844, Rev'd Isaac  
 Gosset was appointed vicar and he     
 found that the church was in very poor
 state. The roof was covered with a    
 cheap and poor-quality slate which    
 blew off in the slightest gale. He    
 also disliked the pulpit despite the  
 fact it dated from Jacobean times.    
 There has been a church building on   
 the site since the 12th century. To   
 the north of the present church is a  
 field called 'Sentry', thought to be a
 corruption of Sanctuary, suggesting   
 the site of former places of worship.
