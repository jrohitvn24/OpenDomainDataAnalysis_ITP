		<content> of the circle.Those you hit out you   
 win.Nowadays each player has a marble.
 The player who hits the others marble 
 keeps them.Children in everyarea have 
 different rules at play.              
    In our school we have these:-      
 " Stops"if anyone stops the           
 marble-even accidentally the player   
 can shout "Stops" and move it futher  
 along.                                
 "Tips"-this rule means that tipping or
 glancing the other players marble     
 counts as a hit.                      
 "Gutts straight"when this has been    
 shouted the other player returns it to
 the gutter.
