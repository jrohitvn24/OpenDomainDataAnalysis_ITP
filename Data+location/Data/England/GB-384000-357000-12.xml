		<title>12Horse Riding, Mow Cop</title>
		<content>  This area is proving to be very      
popular with people who like horses.   
There are a number of horses kept in   
fields around Mow Cop and in terms of  
field occupied by horses they equal    
fields of cows or other animals.       
A lot are kept singly or in pairs in a 
small field adjacent to a house, the   
spread nature of the buildings on Mow  
Cop help this.                         
   There is a riding school called     
Siddall's at Machins Farm, near the    
disused quarries on the road leading to
Gillow Heath. Here small parties are   
taken out on escorted rides, riders are
taught how to jump and how to ride.
