		<content>  Mrs Cardall has a small{museum}in her
 house. Her late husband was a fireman 
 who collected many items over the     
 years revealing Southam's life in the 
 past. Since the 1960's she has opened 
 her home to groups of interested      
 people, many of whom donate further   
 items.                                
  Mr Graham-Jones owns and runs a small
{zoo.}He regards his animals as his    
 family and is often seen out with them
 around the town. Many of them are used
 in advertising and videos and have    
 become celebrities. At Christmas all  
 the animals are given a present and   
 Joe the old chimp has a cigar and a   
 glass of wine. Birthdays are special  
 occasions too!                        
  He has 120 animals, 42 of them are   
 big cats including a{black jaguar     
 which even London Zoo doesn't possess.
 Holidays are out for Mr Graham-Jones! </content>
