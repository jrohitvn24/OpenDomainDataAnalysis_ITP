 invited to school to discuss village  
 life in the 1920's and 1930's.        
  The village was then made up of a    
 small number of houses around the     
 church.Roads were narrow nd bounded by
 high Cornish hedges.Passing places had
 to be made to allow vehicles to pass. 
 Most people worked in agriculture or  
 associated industry.There were        
 blacksmiths,carpenters,tailors,carters
 etc.Very few had to travel outside of 
 the parish to work.                   
  Services.There was no mains          
 water,electricity or refuse
