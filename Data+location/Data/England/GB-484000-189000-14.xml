		<content> The Beef-eater is a{restaurant}.It is 
 fifty years old and was a pub when it 
 was built.It has been a "Steak-house" 
 for just over a year.The{menu}consists
 of a piece of beef,or fish with chips 
 served  with salad.You can have wine  
 with the meal.One thing you may do is 
 fill in a form saying when your       
 child's birthday is then take him or  
 her to the "steak-house"as a birthday 
 treat.There will be a birthday        
 party waiting.The{life-style}of a lot 
 of people is to eat away from home at 
 the Beef-eater on one day of the week,
 usually at the weekend.
