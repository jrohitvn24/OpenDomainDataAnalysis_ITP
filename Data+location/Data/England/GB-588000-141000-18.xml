		<title>18Farm Through a Child's Eyes</title>
		<content> I like living on a farm because       
 there's lots to do. I enjoy helping my
 Dad on the farm, particularly driving 
 the tractor with the tillaerator on   
 the back. This winter was the worst   
 for 20 years. The snow was over a foot
 deep &amp; it was great because the school
 bus couldn't get through &amp; we stayed  
 at home. The river was shallow &amp;      
 frozen, we pushed each other along it 
 on sledges and then played snowballs. 
 We got very cold and wet and Mum gave 
 us steaming hot mugs of soup in front 
 of the fire when we got home.         
{An August Day}                        
 I got up and walked my dog on the     
 Minnis. After breakfast I played space
 games on my computer. I met my friend 
 and played soldiers. After lunch I    
 rode my bike to the BMX track &amp; tried 
 some jumps. In the evening I watched  
 TV, read a book and went to bed.      </content>
