		<content> Etherow Country Park Wardens.         
                                       
 We went to the Country Park and walked
 around the lake. When we got back to  
 the Visitor's Centre we met Mr.       
 Fernley, the Chief Warden and Tony one
 of the Park Wardens. We found out that
 the wardens must have some knowledge  
 of Nature, trees, birds and animals.  
 Most of the wardens work far more than
 the 37 hours required.Tony starts at  
 7-50 a.m. and can still be working    
 late at night. Tony is there to help  
 people and to look out for people     
 misbehaving. For instance, fishermen  
 fishing in the wrong places. There are
 about 1/4 million visitors each year  
 and there are several full-time       
 wardens and 21 part-time helpers to   
 assist them.
