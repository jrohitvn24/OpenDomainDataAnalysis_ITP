		<content> In this area we discovered quite a lot
 of shops, mostly food shops, and quite
 a few Petrol Stations and Newsagents. 
 There are also plenty of schools in   
 the near vicinity.                    
 There are lots of playing fields and a
 Sports Ground, and the area is mostly 
 shops and housing establishments. The 
 Lido (part of the Lea (or Lee) Valley 
 Park) is in the North East of this    
 area.                                 
 There is a college in the South of the
 area, and also nurseries.             
 There is a railway service running    
 along the Eastern side of Wormley, and
 the station is near the Lido.         
 The schools in Wormley that were      
 surveyed were all middle or secondary.
