		<title>14EDUCATION: MARKET WESTON</title>
		<content>To our small communities the village   
schools are most important. In l96l    
Market Weston was closed &amp; the children
now go to Hopton Primary &amp; then onto   
Stanton Middle &amp; Thurston Upper school.
Market Weston being 1.5 miles from Hop-
ton school does not qualify for school 
transport so children are usually taken
by parents in cars or walk.The meeting 
of mothers &amp; parents,through the child-
ren contirbutes greatly to social con- 
tact between villages. When the child- 
ren transfer to the middle &amp; upper     
schools they are transported by coaches
contracted by the County Council &amp; the 
parents loose this daily contact with  
each other. It is generally felt that  
when a village school is closed the    
whole community suffers.
