		<content>{AN IMPRESSION OF OUR SURVEY AREA      
{ } We conducted our survey on a Friday
 afternoon late in June on a fine      
 summer's day.  Twenty-eight of us set 
 out on our bikes and on foot, to count
 those things the survey required.     
    Our area was quite flat and        
 consisted of mostly fields with narrow
 country lanes.  Some grass was growing
 and was being grazed upon by{Friesian}
 cattle, but much was being cut and    
 collected for sileage.                
    The area was very quiet with few   
 people around except where the main   
 Nantwich to Middlewich road ran.      
 Here, there was a steady stream of    
 busy traffic.  Here also was our only 
 pub, the Waggon and Horses, only yards
 from a local parish church.           
    The main types of housing (few as  
 they were), were farms, scattered     
 widely.                               </content>
