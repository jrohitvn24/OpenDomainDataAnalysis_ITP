		<title>03THE FARMING YEAR  MILK</title>
		<content> My name is Joanne Scott.I live on a   
 dairy farm.                           
 Dad starts work at 6.30am.            
 He gets the cows in from the field    
 into the collection yard.He starts    
 milking the cows.We have 128 cows to  
 milk.We have Automatic Cluster        
 Removers.When the cows have finished  
 they come off by themselves.After the 
 cows have been milked they go down a  
 passage into the cubicle shed where   
 they can have something to eat or lie 
 down.                                 
   In the evening the same thing       
 happens again.                        
    The tanker comes and takes the     
  milk to a dairy in the morning.      
    At the dairy it is cleaned,put into
  bottles and then delivered to the    
 milkman who delivers it to our doors. 
                                       
                                       </content>
