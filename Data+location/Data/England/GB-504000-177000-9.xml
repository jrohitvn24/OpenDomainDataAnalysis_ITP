		<title>09THE CIRCUS</title>
		<content> The American Circus Hoffman has set up
 camp on the recreation ground at the  
 bottom of Porters Way. They invited   
 all the school to visit them during   
 the day to see the animals. We went, a
 class at a time. There were 5         
 beautiful tigers lazing in their cages
 but they became very alert and growled
 softly when a small dog ran past.     
 There were 2 small elephants, ponies  
 horses,lamas and camels. They were all
 in a huge tent with the sides rolled  
 up and each end open because it was a 
 very hot day. All the animals looked  
 well cared for.                       
                                       
 All the children were given a voucher 
 so that they could see the show in the
 eveneing at a cheaper price.
