		<title>11Walberton-Resident's Jobs</title>
		<content>   Based on the occupations of the     
 parents of the school-children        
 Walberton is largely a dormitory      
 village.  Most of the parents working 
 locally are in horticulture or        
 agriculture, but more than 75% of     
 parents work outside the village.     
                                       
   The following list will give an idea
 of the ocupations followed:_ local    
 government, fire service, police,     
 doctor, farmer, grower under glass,   
 Royal Navy, lecturer, teacher,        
 publican, representatives, carpenter, 
 draughtsmen, carpenter, plumber,      
 electrician, etc.  The large          
 'middle-class' proportion is          
 representative of the village makeup. 
                                       
   Several mothers work part-time, many
 in the local glass-houses.
