		<content>Twelve years ago in 1963 the idea arose
of building a large community to house 
twelve thousand people. After a number 
of years the go-ahead was given. Perton
Village was born and building began in 
1968.                                  
    At one time the planners forcast   
that the community was to have a       
Church, a number of Schools, a Health  
Centre, large Recreation Areas and     
Lakes.                                 
    The first house to be completed in 
Wolverhampton's 'mini-town' was in     
fact a two hundred year old Farmhouse  
(now destroyed). This Farmhouse called 
Dippons Farm was in the south western  
sector of the development of some three
thousand homes. Indeed the estate may  
not have been built built because of   
its great bill running into millions of
pounds.
