		<content>Several hairdressers, a Co-op Foodstore
and a Grocers shop next to the Village 
Hall complete this side of the Street. 
Next to the Mill is the old Hall, a    
black and white building built in 1613,
in front of which is the Village War   
Memorial.                              
There are 'bus stops on either side of 
the street for people to travel to     
Stoke and Uttoxeter.I was told that the
High Street is a more pleasant street  
since the village was by-passed last   
February(1985).Before that, many       
accidents occurred with shops and      
houses damaged by lorries that could   
not manouevre around the bend at the   
East end of the street.
