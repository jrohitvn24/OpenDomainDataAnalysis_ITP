		<content> The national decline in church_going  
 is less evident in our area, and a    
 number of organisations connected with
 churches are thriving. Sunday schools,
 youth clubs, scouting and guiding     
 organisations, young wives and clubs  
 for pensioners all play their part in 
 the community life. Although our area 
 has no synagogoues, mosques or        
 temples, it does have five different  
 denominations of Christian church.    
 Nearby Derby has a Quaker             
 meeting_house and Langley Mill has a  
 Jehovah's Witness (Kingdom Hall).     
 Belper has a thriving Peace Group. All
 this is a result of mounting concern  
 over the international nuclear arms   
 race. Local people have also played   
 thier part in helping those suffering 
 in the famines of Ethopia and Sudan.
