		<title>20THE DAIRY FARM</title>
		<content> Baddiley Farm, Swanley Lane,          
 Ravensmoor.  Proprietor: Mr. Winward  
                                       
 The farmer has lived here for 16      
 years. The farm is 80 hectares, with  
 12 fields between 2 and 14 hectares.  
 All fields are under grass for        
 grazing and silage. His herd is 260   
 dairy cows. When a cow is about 3     
 years old she has her first calf, and 
 hopefully one a year after that.      
    The farmer's day starts at 5 a.m.  
 He milks the cows at 6 a.m and 4 p.m, 
 18 at a time in the milking parlour.  
 He milks them for 4 minutes and a     
 minute after milking he puts          
 antiseptic on the teats to stop       
 infection. The vet checks the animals 
 every 2 weeks.The milk goes into a    
 large tank and is used for milk or    
 making cheese.                        
                                       </content>
