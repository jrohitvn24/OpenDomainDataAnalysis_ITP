		<title>03WITHYGROW'S FARM - 1</title>
		<content>  Withygrow's Farm covers 62 acres. It 
 is the smallest farm in the parish. It
 is a mixed farm owned by Mr &amp; Mrs     
 Whittaker. There are cattle and sheep 
 and they also grow potatoes.          
  Hereford cattle are used for beef and
 for dairying. Fodder beet is grown for
 the cows to eat in winter. The cowshed
 is 33 years old and houses a bulk     
 tank. Each cow's milk goes into       
 different bottles where it is weighed 
 before being stored in the            
 refridgerated tank. The milk is sent  
 to Stonehouse Creamery and thence to  
 London. The calves go in the old      
 cowsheds. The cattle are fed on cattle
 cake and also hay and barley treated  
 hydroponically.                       
  There are 39 sheep, one ram and,at   
 present, 20 lambs. The lambs are      
 fattened for market. The farm has its 
 own sheep-dip used by other farmers.  </content>
