		<title>07VIEWS ON THE BYPASS.</title>
		<content> Only houses directly next to the      
 bypass will receive compensation but  
 all the local residents will be       
 affected by the bypass as{Thorpe Lane 
 is to become a cul_de_sac, stopping   
 the existing bus route to the local   
 school and surrounding villages, and  
 as many of the residents of Thorpe    
 Lane are retired, walking the extra   
 mile to the bus stop will be          
 difficult, and some say{"hopeless".   
  No housing has had to be sold but    
 several land owners, including Pennels
 Garden Centre have suffered, although 
 most of the road runs through disused 
 quarries.                             
 The majority of people do not think   
 the bypass will bring more people to  
 Thorpe, and it will deter people from 
 buying houses in the area.It is       
 considered by most{a necessary evil!
