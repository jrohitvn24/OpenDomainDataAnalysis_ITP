		<title>09HOUSES IN DALWOOD</title>
		<content>   The oldest house still standing in  
 Dalwood is called Eastons. It was     
 built in 1644. As were houses at that 
 time, it is timber framed with cruck  
 beams. A cruck beam is made by sawing 
 a bent tree down the middle. Two other
 old houses are Brook Cottage, which   
 was built in 1838, and Old Yew        
 Cottage, which used to be two         
 cottages but is now one. The newest   
 houses are on two estates called      
 Mowbars Hayes and Town Court. There is
 also a recently built house called    
 Green Ends next to the church on land 
 where there was once a farm.The two   
 housing estates were also built on    
 farm land.There are now around twice  
 as many houses as there were twenty   
 years ago. Many of the new houses are 
 bungalows, as more retired people have
 moved into the village._
