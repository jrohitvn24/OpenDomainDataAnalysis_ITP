 St. Agnes is 77 years old.  Mr        
 Henley is a rector.  A rector teaches 
 people and takes the services.  St.   
 Agnes has got an organ and a piano.   
 Charles White built St. Agnes and the 
 stone came from a farm house in Hooke 
 Hill.  The church has got one bell on 
 the top and is used every Sunday.     
 Fifty people go to St. Agnes every    
 Sunday.  The building has not been    
 added to.  They have one clergy man   
 and that is Mr Henley.  The screen was
 carved by Reverend T.G. Devitt.
