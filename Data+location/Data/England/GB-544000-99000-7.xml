		<title>07REVIEWING NEWHAVEN'S PAST</title>
		<content> Castle Hill had Neolithic, Celtic and 
 Roman settlements.  Under the Police  
 Station is a Roman villa.  Newhaven's 
 Saxon name was Meeching. A Saxon      
 cemetery was found at Bishopstone and 
 Saxon, Norman and Meeching roads      
 recall the past.  The settlement was  
 renamed Newhaven in the 16th century  
 when the course of the river was      
 rechannelled to exit at its present   
 mouth because Seaford port, its       
 original outlet, became silted up.    
 The ferry has been replaced in turn by
 a tilt bridge, swing bridge and an    
 electically controlled bridge.  A     
 Dieppe Ferry service made Newhaven an 
 important South Coast port.  Tidemills
 once had a flour mill using tidal     
 power.  A workhouse was built in 1836 
 for the poor and a fort as protection 
 from French attack, 1868.  In 1942 the
 ill fated Dieppe Raid left from here. </content>
