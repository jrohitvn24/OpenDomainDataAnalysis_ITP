		<content> The village has many forms of         
 transport, the most popular being the 
 motor car,serviced by two garages     
 There is a bus service which runs from
 Lancaster seven times per day.School  
 children attending Secondary schools  
 in Lancaster use this bus service.They
 are brought to a central point in the 
 village by a local school taxi,then by
 bus on to Lancaster.All farmers in the
 village have tractors which they use  
 to move their goods.Many have cattle  
 trailers pulled by their cars,to take 
 their stock to market.There is one    
 Haulage Contractor in the village who 
 has three trucks,each capable of      
 carrying about 20 tonnes.These are    
 mostly engaged in hauling stone from  
 quarries North of Lancaster for the   
 building trade throughout             
 Lancashire.The builders have small    
 vans which they use for business.     </content>
