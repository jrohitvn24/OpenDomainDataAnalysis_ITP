		<title>07SALTBURN TRANSPORT SERVICES</title>
		<content> Saltburn and Skelton are served by two
 bus companies and British Railway.    
 Regular bus services take people to   
 nearby towns and villages while the   
 train service has direct links with   
 Teeside airport and inter-city train  
 services. In a survey we found that   
 most people in Saltburn have their own
 transport which many used for getting 
 to work. Buses were used on afternoons
 by elderly people with bus passes. The
 main complaints about public transport
 were the frequency of services, cost  
 and smoking. Recent fare rises on the 
 pay train service was unpopular. A    
 census of Saltburn's busy main road at
 midday consisted mainly of cars and a 
 few buses. Approx. 40 vans passed     
 probably serving local shops and      
 homes.  The high number of bicycles   
 that passed suggests that the overall 
 traffic flow is not heavy.            </content>
