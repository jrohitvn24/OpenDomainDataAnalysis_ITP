		<title>02FARMING - BURGHFIELD</title>
		<content> Home Farm consists of six-hundred     
 acres and is used for breeding dairy  
 cattle and growing cereal.  Fresian   
 cows are kept; they are milked in a   
 herring-bone parlour which is so      
 called because from the top view it   
 looks like a herring's spine.         
 We went to see some silage and it     
 smelt like very sour vinegar.  We then
 went to see some calves which were    
 only two days old.  There were fifty  
 calves in the shed and each one had a 
 pen only four or five times bigger    
 than itself.                          
 Next we went to see the Beef house    
 where all the one-year old bulls are  
 kept.  They were just about to be     
 slaughtered.  We next saw a fourteen  
 hundred-weight bull who was led by a  
 rope from a ring in his nose.
