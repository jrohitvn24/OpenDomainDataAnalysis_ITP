		<title>08OVER WYRESDALE: FARM WORK</title>
		<content>    While most of the work on the farms
 is done by the owners or tenants and  
 their families some of the major tasks
 are contracted out, often to men from 
 the local area. The cost of machinery 
 required for such tasks as making     
 silage may be too high for individual 
 farmers,and contractors also bring men
 with them so that the work is finished
 more rapidly. Owing to the very wet   
 summer in 1985 'big bale' silage,which
 is stored in large black plastic bags,
 has been made here for the first time.
 Sheep shearing is rarely done by the  
 farmer himself, nor is hedging.       
 The farmer at Swainshead Hall rears   
 horses in addition to sheep on land   
 in the south of the area. This man is 
 the only one here to grow any cereals,
 but merely a small quantity of barley.
 There are also some field trials of   
 potatoes on this farm.                </content>
