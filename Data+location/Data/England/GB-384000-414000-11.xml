		<title>11Milcroft Tea Gardens</title>
		<content> Milcroft tea gardens was built as a   
 farm around 1700. At the turn of this 
 century it was made into a market     
 garden and planted with both fruit and
 ornamental trees. The monkey-puzzle   
 trees date from this time. The market 
 garden was not a great success so a   
 shed was added to the side of the     
 house and the opened as a tea garden. 
    "Our busiest time is when it is    
 sunny. We get about 100 people. In bad
 weather we might get less than 6."    
 There are old plaques on the wall, one
 of Queen Victoria from 1880 and       
 another from the fire in Rochdale Town
 Hall in 1880. The plant pots outside  
 the gardens show eight types of       
 flowers and trees in the area. The    
 gardens are also used to stage various
 sorts of entertainment.
