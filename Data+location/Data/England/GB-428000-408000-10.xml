		<content> There has been a parish{church}in     
 Darton since Norman times.The present 
 building was built mainly in 1517.The 
{vicar}is Father Seymour.Every month   
 except August and September the Boy's 
 Brigade marches up to the church from 
 the Sunday School.In 1983 and 1984    
 some local ladies worked together to  
 make a patch work quilt with          
 embroidered pictures telling the      
 history of Darton.It is hanging on a  
 wooden frame in the church and is     
 called Darton Heritage Quilt.         
   The Sunday School in Church Street  
 was built in 1818 and many groups     
 still meet here:the Mothers Union,the 
 Busy Fingers for younger girls,Boy's  
 Brigade and Darton Dramatic Society.  
   There are several Methodist chapels 
 in the area and a Catholic church.    
 Besides the Sunday Schools there are  
 Youth Clubs.                          </content>
