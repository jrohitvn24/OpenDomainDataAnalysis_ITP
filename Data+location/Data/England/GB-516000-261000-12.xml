		<title>12St.NEOTS GOLF CLUB</title>
		<content> We recorded our interview with the    
 secretary, Mr. Walker,of St. Neots    
 Golf Course which is south of Little  
 Paxton.He told us that there wa 600   
 members of the club but fortunately   
 they didnt all turn up to play at 8   
 o'clock on a Sunday morning.          
  The club was a nine hole course and  
 when the land was bought the previous 
 owner was allowed to graze his pigs   
 but had to keep them off the greens.  
  In the next five years St.Neots is   
 expected to grow to a population of   
 10 000.This means that the future of  
 the club membership will be secure.Two
 celebraties have been associated  with
 the club. One, Harry Barden, gave his 
 name to the golfers grip.The other    
 player being Tony Jacklin.            
  The course has now has 18 holes.A    
 Professional supplies, repairs and    
 coaches, but only at the club.        </content>
