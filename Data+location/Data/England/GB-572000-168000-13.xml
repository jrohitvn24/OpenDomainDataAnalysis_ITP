		<title>13STROOD MARKET</title>
		<content>  My name is Sonia Chhabra.  I rarely  
go down to Strood market, but when I do
I enjoy myself very much.  It opens    
every Tuesday from 8 a.m - 4.30 p.m.   
They have various items of clothing for
all generations, which are at          
reasonable prices.  I think they ought 
to have this market more than once a   
week.                                  
  They sell vegetables, fruit, fish,   
shoes, jewellery and many fashionable  
clothes.                               
  Every Tuesday people rush down there 
to get their goods, while the kids are 
at school.  The noise is tremendous    
whilst the market sellers shout at the 
top of their voices, trying to get rid 
of their goods.
