		<content>      The S.W. end of West Ashton vill-
 age falls in our 3x4 block. Most of   
 the housing in this section is concen-
 rated 'in-fill' that has taken place  
 in the last 10 years. The houses are  
 individually designed, executive type,
 built in brick or reconstituted stone.
 Interspersed are a few pre 2nd W.War  
 dwellings and the original farm houses
 which are approx 200yrs old. At the   
 end of the village is a group of 4 s/d
 council houses.Another group of 8 s/d 
 council houses built in 1952/3 is just
 along the East Town Rd.               
      Other housing in the area is     
 confined to the hamlets of East Town  
 and Dunge, a few individual houses a- 
 long Capps Lane, and the isolated farm
 houses. Some of the farmhouses are be-
 tween 200-300 yrs old and are fine    
 buildings, due to be listed in the    
 near future.                          </content>
