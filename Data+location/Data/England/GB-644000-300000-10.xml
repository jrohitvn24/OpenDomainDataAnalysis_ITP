		<title>10BURGH CASTLE MARINA</title>
		<content>   'Marina' is a rather grandiose      
 title for this site on the River      
 Waveney.Although there are facilities 
 for mooring and re-fuelling boats;a   
 small marine engineering company;and a
 number of holiday chalets it appears  
 never to have grown in the way that   
 its owners might have hoped.Permission
 was sought to extend the mooring space
 by using the nearby reed beds, but    
 this was denied.The marina and        
 adjoining caravan sites do however    
 provide much needed part-time         
 employment for local people.
