		<title>14MY FREETIME IN BLAGDON</title>
		<content> In my free time I go to a{BMX track,  
 which has been built on the Mead for  
 us, behind the{tennis courts.}I just  
 go around and try new tricks like a   
 Camel kick at the edge of the quarter 
 pipe.You go up to the edge of the     
 quarter pipe and pull on front brake. 
 So that the back wheel goes up and    
 down again.Then you have to dive away 
 but all this has to be done with out  
 your feet touching the ground.        
 Sometimes in my freetime I go to the  
{swing and pipes}there on the Mead.    
 In the summer my mum takes me to      
{Coombe Lodge}which is staff training  
 college.There is a{swimming pool,     
 which pool can only be used by staff  
 and close relations.The people who are
 staying there are allowed to go       
 swimming but if the pool is cold you  
 can play{tennis.                      
                                       </content>
