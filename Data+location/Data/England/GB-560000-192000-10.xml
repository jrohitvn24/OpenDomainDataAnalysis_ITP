		<content>  The principle means of transport is  
 by car, bus and train. Relatively few 
 people (mainly school pupils) use     
 bicycles.                             
{RAILWAY}- 687 trains pass through the 
 area in 24 hours on a weekday, and 297
 stop at Shenfield Station showing its 
 importance as a commuting centre and  
 railway junction. On a weekday 6700   
 passengers join trains at Shenfield;  
 Of these 3300 join 40 trains departing
 to London between 0700 and 1000 hours.
 3000 alight from 35 trains from London
 between 1600 and 1900.                
{ROADS}- Because of the great amount of
 commuting the road network is under   
 great pressure at peak hours despite  
 the town's northern by-pass (A12) and 
 the recently opened M25. The intensity
 of peak tidal flow is high and even   
 off-peak residual traffic is          
 considerable.                         </content>
