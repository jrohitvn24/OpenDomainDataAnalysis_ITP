		<title>12BIRSTALL C.C. FOOTBALL CLUB</title>
		<content> The club was founded in the 1970's.   
 There are regular meetings at         
{Longslade School and the Wanlip       
{Country Club.}Every year there is a   
 prize giving evening where any trophy 
 that has been won is presented. This  
 year,{Tommy Williams, a Leicester City
{player,}presented all the trophies.   
    You have to be 9 years old to join 
 and you must leave when you are 16.   
    This year we entered a 5_a_side    
 competition at the{Birstall May Fair  
 and all of the teams apart from the   
 Under 11's B Team and the Under 16's B
 Team won their finals. The Under 11's,
 the team I play for, were runners-up  
 in a final and won a very splendid    
 trophy at the{Derwent Dynamo          
{Tournament.                           
    A lot of support is needed at      
 matches and meetings but we do not    
 always get enough people to help.     </content>
