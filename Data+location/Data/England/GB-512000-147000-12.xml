		<content>      Home is a place where you find   
 love and care.  Today children spend  
 a lot of time{watching television}or  
 playing with the{computers.} Almost   
 every home owns at least one          
 television.  Many children spend time 
 alone because parents are working or  
 are away from home.  Most children do 
 chores at home especially if both     
 parents are at work.  65% of children 
 aged 13 who were interviewed had their
 own door key.  At home, children      
 frequently argue with brothers,       
 sisters and parents.  One problem is  
 when children in the family take each 
 others possessions without asking     
 permission.                           
      Viewers of the television are    
 sometimes bored by what they watch.   
 According to our survey life in the   
 home in 1985 is dominated by          
 television.                           </content>
