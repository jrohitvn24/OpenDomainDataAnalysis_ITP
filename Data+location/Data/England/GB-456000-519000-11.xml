		<content> Should any major crime occur it may be
 dealt with by myself at the start of  
 the enquiry,but will be followed up   
 later by investigations from the      
 C.I.D.The few farms have              
 trouble,mainly in the summer,from     
 people trespassing over the           
 crops,riding motorcycles over the land
 or setting fire to hay,crops or       
 buildings.This occurs infrequently.The
 local courts are,Teesside Magistrates 
 Courts,held at Middlesbrough,about 5  
 miles away.I only have to attend the  
 courts when a person whom I have      
 charged or summoned enters a not      
 guilty plea,then I attend and give my 
 evidence,or when that person appeals  
 against the sentence or fine he was   
 given."
