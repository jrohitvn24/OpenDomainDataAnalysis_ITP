		<title>03Landscore Primary School</title>
		<content>   Landscore Primary School (first     
 phase) was built in 1975. It is a     
 semi{open-plan}school - its four main 
 "classrooms" leading onto a corridor. 
 The second phase of the school has not
 been built, so two{mobiles}have been  
 added to the main site and the infant 
 pupils remain at the{Old School,}300  
 metres away.                          
   There are just under 180 pupils,    
 aged 5-11, with 5.5 teaching staff and
 the Headmistress, Mrs Postance.       
   The school's{name}is{derived}from   
 the farm land that was "scored" off or
 divided into strips according to      
 ownership.                            
   One of the children describes       
 Landscore thus:                       
   "The children that go to Landscore  
 are usually quite{well-mannered.}Some 
 children in some schools are much     
 ruder."                               </content>
