    This area is mainly farmland.The   
main area of population is the village 
of Tattingstone with a population of   
about six hundred including the        
hospital patients.                     
    Most of the rest of the area has   
isolated farmhouses with tied  cottages
which are often very old e.g.Hubbard's 
Hall Farm dates back to the fifteenth  
century.                               
  Many houses in Tattingstone date     
back to Elizabethan times.Some of the  
cottages are thatched but many have had
their thatch replaced with tiles.In    
1948 12 council houses were built in   
Green Lane and later six more were     
built on Lemon's Hill.There are eight  
old age pensioners houses in  Glebe    
Close.In the last few  years many new  
expnsive detached houses and bungalows 
have been buillt e.g.in The Close.     </content>
