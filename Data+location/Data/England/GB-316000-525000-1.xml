		<title>01High Lorton and Whinlatter.</title>
		<content>   This area,on the north-western edge 
 of the{Lake District National Park,}is
 principally one of{fell}and{forest,}  
 with the small village of{High Lorton 
 in its south-western corner.          
   Apart from forestry plantation,the  
 village and some cultivated fields,by 
 far the largest proportion of it is   
 taken up by {sheep-pasture},either in 
 enclosed fields or on the open fell.  
   Running across the south-western    
 corner is the B5292,linking the towns 
 of Cockermouth and Keswick.At High    
 Lorton the road begins climbing to    
 cross{Whinlatter Pass},most of which  
 is planted with conifers and forms    
 part of{Thornthwaite Forest.}         
   The village of High Lorton consists 
 of traditional slate houses,several   
 more modern bungalows and a few       
 outlying farms.It has a church,primary
 school,inn and post-office/shop.      </content>
