		<title>13A PARTICULAR DAY 24.6.1985</title>
		<content> A particular Monday for a ten year old
 girl. I woke up at{8.15 a.m.}and got  
 dressed. I washed my hands and face,  
 then had some Coco Pops with cream off
 the milk. My mum did my hair. At about
{8.40 a.m.}I went down the lane to my  
 Nanna's to say bye bye because she's  
 going on holiday in Corfu. When I got 
 to school I took my coat off, changed 
 my shoes and went into our class. The 
 fourth years were going to London with
 our teacher, so we had to go into     
 Mrs.Lyon's class. At playtime I got my
 tuck from the tuck shop, then played  
 tick with Donna and Laura. After break
 we did some writing then we had dinner
 at{12.00 noon.}After dinner I played  
 sevens against the wall with a ball.  
 After dinner play we did some work    
 sheets with Mrs.Screaton. We went home
 at{3.15 p.m.}I walked down the yard to
 groom my pony Dinkie,then home to tea.</content>
