		<content> One of the main buildings in Weaste is
 a large bus garage. it used to be the 
 tram depot (796 984) but now houses   
 hundreds of buses belonging to Greater
 Manchester Transport. Just a few      
 hundred yards to the north of this is 
 Salford Rugby League Football Club's  
 ground called 'The Willows' after the 
 name of Salford, which means 'the ford
 where the willows grow'. It is a      
 popular team and has built a large    
 social club attatched to the ground   
 where people can have a drink or a    
 meal. This raises money to help the   
 club with its running expenses. It is 
 surrounded by streets of terraced     
 houses. (795 989).
