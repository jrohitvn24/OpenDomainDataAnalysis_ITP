 DIFFICULT.FORMERLY THE BOATS WERE     
 MANHANDLED ON WOODEN ROLLERS ,WINCH   
 ASSISTED.THE HEAVY BOATS WERE FLOATED 
 ONTO A TRAILER.DOWNDERRY NOW HAS A    
 UNIQUE FORM OF BOATLIFT WHEREBY THE   
 CRAFT IS UNDERSLUNG BENEATH A         
 HORIZONTAL GIRDER WHICH IS ITSELF ON  
 WHEELS.THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT       
 DESIGNS TO BE SEEN.SOME RAISE THE BOAT
 BY ROPE AND PULLEY,OTHERS USE THE     
 GIRDER AS A LEVER.THE ORIGINAL{1956   
 DESIGN USED THE CROWN WHEEL AND PINION
 OF A VAN TO PROVIDE THE THE MECHANICAL
 ADVANTAGE.THE INVENTORS,MR. W HOCKING 
 (DOWNDERRY BILL)&amp; MR. A.PALMER WERE   
 PLEASED TO SEE THEIR IDEA PRESENTED IN
