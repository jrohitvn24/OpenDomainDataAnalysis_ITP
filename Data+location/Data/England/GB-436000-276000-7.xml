		<content> Ernesford Grange Community College is 
 a focal point because of the number of
 courses it offers to the community    
 that surrounds it. The school opened  
 in 1970 and it is estimated that over 
 3,000 people apart from school        
 children use the schools facilities.  
   The swimming pool is the most used  
 facility. Even teachers use the sports
 complex with visiting staffs from     
 other schools.                        
   Unemployment in Coventry means that 
 there is a greater need for this      
 centre and so fees are kept as low as 
 possible.                             
   The Deputy Head of the school said  
 that although the school is one of the
 most used in the city it is also one  
 of the least vandalised. There is     
 little trouble from the community and 
 the amenities are really appreciated  
 by everyone.                          </content>
