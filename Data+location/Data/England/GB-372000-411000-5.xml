		<title>05Shops in N.E.Bolton</title>
		<content> There are two main shopping areas -   
 Bromley Cross and Harwood Precinct.   
 There are twenty two shops at Bromley 
 Cross and they are located on either  
 side of a busy main road eg butcher's,
 newsagents and a video shop.The Co-Op 
 supermarket was extended in 1982.The  
 Post Office dispenses 2,350 pensions  
 and allowances each week.Limited car  
 parking space is a major problem.     
 Harwood Precinct has nineteen shops,is
 traffic free and has a good car       
 park.It was built twenty years ago    
 and again caters mostly for everyday  
 needs although there are also clothes 
 shops and a sports shop.              
 Shops are found strung out along the  
 main roads at Bradshaw Brow and       
 Longsight,but there are no shops on   
 the new estates.                      
 Affetside has to rely on a mobile     
 shop.                                 </content>
