		<content> Leigh Sinton is rich in local history.
 For instance Castle Mound which is    
 quite near the village. If you turn   
 down Sherridge Road from the village  
 turn off on the first turning right   
 down a track . Follow that track      
 until you come to a big farm.         
 Castle Mound is directly north from   
 there. If you go north from there you 
 come to the Inner Bailey. If you go   
 north west from there you come to the 
 west side of the mound. If you go     
 north east there were other traces of 
 enclosures but they are now           
 obliterated . At the end of the track 
 if you look straight ahead you can see
 a sort of stable porch way and above  
 that there is a barn. The barn was    
 built in the 16th century and is going
 to be taken to a museum. It is on the 
 property of Castle Green Farm.
