		<content> Perhaps the most noticeable fact about
 home life in this area is that every  
 single household has at least one     
 television set,one has four,which     
 would imply that viewing is an        
 individual occupation rather than one 
 for the whole family. All homes have  
 electricity,but a few still rely on   
 privatewater supplies which restricts 
 the use of automatic washing          
 machines,and they have to have a      
 septic tank for sewage. ONly three    
 homes have no telephone,these same    
 households do not have a car or a     
 freezer,they are all senior citizens  
 who have lived in the same cottages   
 for many years. Apart from these three
 most of the families have well equiped
 homes,including tumble driers,        
 micro-wave ovens, vidoes and one has a
 computer.
