One of the games I play in the         
playground is stuck in the mud.It is a 
bit lioke tig.One person is on while   
everyone else runs around trying to    
dodge the person who is on.If you get  
tug you have to stand with your feet   
apart like you are stuck in some mud   
until someone crawls through your legs 
to set you free.                       
  Another game we play is called Red   
Rover.There are two sides.Each side    
lines up holding hands facing the      
opposition then one group calls,'Red   
Rover sent someone right over' and the 
someone has to charge to the other side
trying to break the link of hands.If   
they get through they can go back to   
ther own side but if they don't they   
have to join the winning side.Each team
takes turns at this.                   
                                       </content>
