		<title>04BUNNY'S OLDEST RESIDENT</title>
		<content> Mrs.Ida Oliver lives in Ivy Cottage on
 Main Street. Her house is 350 years   
 old. There are five very old houses in
 the village and these houses had the  
 first telephones and electricity. They
 also had water from Bunny Hill piped  
 through lead pipes into back yard     
 tanks. Everyone collected rain water  
 in tubs. This was used on Mondays for 
 washing. Mrs. Oliver still has a wash 
 house with a fireplace in it. After   
 mains water was brought in Mr. Oliver 
 still used rain water to shave. Mrs.  
 Oliver can remember when the Fairham  
 Brook flooded so deep it went up to   
 the horses' tummies outside the shop. 
 Sometimes the brook was blocked on    
 purpose near the bridge, and used for 
 sheep dipping. Once a year it was     
 cleaned out. Mrs. Oliver is the oldest
 resident in Bunny, being in her 90's. 
 and she has lived here for 50 years.  </content>
