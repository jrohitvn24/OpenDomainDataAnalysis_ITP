		<content> The reference number of our second    
 block is 05080375 and our area covers 
 Newball and Bullington.               
  The area is very low lying and has   
 only recently been extensively        
 drained.Five or six years ago Barlings
 river was dredged and deepened.The    
 farmers have been able to improve the 
 drainage of their land.The group of   
 children surveying the area noticed   
 that ditches had been deepened and new
 land drains made.                     
  Some old pasture has been ploughed   
 and consequently,when we looked around
 most of the fields seemed to be taken 
 over by winter wheat and sugar-beet.  
 When we looked around we could see    
 that the woodlands seemed to be on    
 higher land.We also noticed that the  
 few farms and houses were built on    
 gravel "islands".
