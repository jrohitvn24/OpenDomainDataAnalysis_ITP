		<content> Girls tend to stick to light colours  
 all year round.In summer pastel       
 colours are fashionable.T-shirts are  
 just casual tops and look more at home
 with jeans which are made from 100%   
 cotton.This winter ski pants were in  
 fashion.They were also in fashion     
 twenty years ago,so this shows fashion
 recycles The fashion now is flowery   
 cotton clothes,baggy tops and tight   
 skirts.A lot of fashion nowadays is   
 influenced by music and various pop   
 groups.Here are a few                 
 examples:trendies,mods,skinheads,punks
 ,teddy boys,heavy metal and           
 rockers.Boys are much the same when it
 comes to fashion.Some boys even wear  
 skirts,but the majority stick to      
 trousers.
