		<content>     The children who live in Upper    
 Clatford go to Goodworth Clatford     
 School. They play in the Recreation   
 Field by Pillhill Brook where there   
 are swings and a slide.               
     Another favourite haunt is Bury   
 Hill, the old iron age fort. They play
 football, rounders, spies and plan    
 attacks on each other up there -      
 friendly of course!  They tend to     
 congregate on the green on the way up 
 to Bury Hill.                         
     Bicycles are very popular as the  
 village is very spread out and the    
 children might live some distance from
 their friends.                        
     They also play around the river   
 and on the old 'Sprat and Winkle'     
 railway line.   They go swimming at   
 the sheep dip and fish in the river   
 too.
