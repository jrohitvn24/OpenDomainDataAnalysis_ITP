		<content> When I got home from school I tidied  
 up the lounge before my mum came home 
 from work.Then I watched{"Kids from   
{Degrassi Street"}and{"Who Sir? Me Sir"
 on{BBC Television.}When my mum came in
 she started the tea so I went upstairs
 and played some tapes.For my tea I had
{cod, parsley sauce}and{oven chips.    
 Then we had{peaches}and{Nestles       
{cream.}After tea I started washing up 
 but half way through I watched the end
 of{"Emmerdale Farm"}on television     
 again. Later I telephoned my friend   
 Lisa and she came to play at my       
 house.I helped my mum put the ironing 
 away and I went to bed at{10.00pm.
