		<title>12Mr. S. a Villager</title>
		<content> Mr S lives at 6 Old Road Brixton near 
 our school steps. He was born in 1910 
 and is 74 years old. He has lived in  
 Brixton all his life. He went to our  
 school and left at 12 years old. He   
 went to work at Yealmbridge Sawmill   
 for 5 shillings (25p) a week. As a boy
 he played in the woods around Brixton 
 and played tricks on the local        
 gamekeeper. They didn't go far from   
 home in those days. They even walked  
 to work. He later worked in the saw   
 mill at Sutton Road, Plymouth. He has 
 seen many changes in Brixton in his   
 life. He has seen many of the woods   
 and fields go to build houses. He has 
 seen many more cars on the roads and  
 the lack of horses. He is very active 
 and owns and rides two motor bikes. He
 also keeps a vegetable garden. He says
 he will be sad when we get our new    
 school but he sees the need for it.   </content>
