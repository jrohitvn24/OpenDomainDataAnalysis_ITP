		<content> The landscape of the region is fairly 
 homogenous,consisting of rolling{grass
{land}divided into small fields by     
{hedges}which have not changed much in 
 the last 100 years.They are cut by a  
 flailing machine,few are laid nowdays.
 There are many free standing{trees},in
 hedges,groups and singly in the fields
 About 6 small{deciduous woods}remain. 
 The map shows most fields to have a   
{pond},but many have been filled; those
 that remain are surrounded by rushes. 
 Marl from these pits was spread on the
 fields,or used for bricks.The{river   
 and its tributaries cut deep into the 
 land and there is evidence of         
{glaciation}in the valleys.The{canal   
 crosses the river Weaver on an{aqua-  
{duct}in a picturesque wooded valley.
