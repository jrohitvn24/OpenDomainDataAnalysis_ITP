		<content>{Trewithen House and Gardens.}         
 Trewithen means in Cornish "house in  
 the spinney".Nowadays the house       
 ocasionally,&amp; the gardens frequently, 
 are open to the public with average   
 attendances of 25,000 a year. The     
 present owners are descended from     
 the Hawkins family,who were largely   
 responsible for building the Georgian 
 house.Many important people have been 
 entertained here,including this year  
 the Queen Mother.The gardens cover    
 about 28 acres,&amp; were mainly          
 established this century.They are par_
 ticularly famous for their exotic     
 spring flowers:magnolias &amp; camellias,&amp;
 several hybrid species have been      
 developed in the nurseries eg.a rhod_ 
 odendron "Trewithen Orange".The       
 nurseries export plants to the USA &amp;  
 elsewhere.Employees have recently     
 increased,4 in house,6 in gardens.    </content>
