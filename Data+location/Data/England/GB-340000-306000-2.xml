		<title>02THE PONTESBURY BUTCHER'S</title>
		<content> The butcher's shop has been in        
 Pontesbury for over a hundred years.  
 It is open for nine hours every day,  
 except Sunday. The butcher fetches    
 some meat from the abbatoir and buys  
 more from other wholesalers,he no     
 longer slaughters on the premises.    
 Before he opens his shop in the       
 morning he has to clean the surfaces  
 of the tables.  Then he cuts the meat 
 and puts it on display in the front of
 the window.  He checks the prices and 
 prepares the tills.  Most of the      
 customers are regulars.  The most     
 popular meats are pork, lamb and      
 minced beef and customers buy joints  
 for Sunday lunch. He employs fifteen  
 people and finds that people now      
 prefer to buy meats which are quick to
 prepare and cook, like sausages,      
 steaks and beefburgers.
