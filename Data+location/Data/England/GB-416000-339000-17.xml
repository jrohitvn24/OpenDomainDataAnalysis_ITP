		<title>17THE HUNT</title>
		<content>    There are about sixty to seventy   
 people in the hunt. It starts at a    
 local  farm. If they catch a fox it   
 is taken back to the farm and then    
 sent to the kennels in Sudbury for the
 dogs.                                 
    The hunt is held about three times 
 a year.  A member of the Royal Family 
 comes about twice a year, but no_one  
 is told except the hunt members in    
 case anti-hunt people come and        
 protest.                              
    The cross_countries are held twice 
 a year. There are sixteen jumps in the
 whole of the cross_country. All the   
 people who have entered have to walk  
 the course to make sure they know it  
 properly.                             
    Everyone has to wear a skull cap or
 they cannot enter. A skull cap        
 protects the head.
