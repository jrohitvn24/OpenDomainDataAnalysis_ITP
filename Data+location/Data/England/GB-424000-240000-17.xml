		<content>  In Shipston-on-Stour,14% of people   
 interviewed used{public transport     
 regularly.40% said that they rarely   
 used public transport.50% used the    
 local bus services.                   
  Shipston-on-Stour had been served by 
 a{horse-drawn bus}from the mid-1800s. 
 A motor bus service commenced in 1903.
 Services increased and reached their  
 peak in the 1950s with 6 routes       
 radiating from Shipston making a total
 of 76 journeys per week.              
  Since that time,the{National Bus     
{Company}services have declined in     
 number to 2 routes along the A34      
 (Birmingham,Stratford - Oxford),      
 but the introduction of express buses 
 has improved long-distance travel.    
{ Barry's Coaches}of Moreton-in-Marsh  
 operate 4 routes along minor roads to 
 local villages and towns such as      
 Banbury,Evesham and Moreton-in-Marsh. </content>
