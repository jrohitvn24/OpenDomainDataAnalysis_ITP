     The weather is very important     
because it affects everything.         
                                       
  In snow it affects farming because   
the farmer has to feed the animals     
because there is no grass when it is   
buried in snow.  The farmer feeds them 
hay and a lot of farmers have milk     
cows and they have to get the milk out 
and a lot of farmers have long lanes   
and they fill up with snow.  The       
farmer has to dig it out with a shovel 
or digger.  If he can't clear the      
lane, the farmer has to take the milk  
to Bill Johnson's - that is the main   
pick-up place.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
