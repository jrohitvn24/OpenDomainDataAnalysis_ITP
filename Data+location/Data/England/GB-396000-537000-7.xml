		<content>  In our area we have an open air      
 swimming pool. This year it opened on 
 the 10th of May to the 6th of         
 September 7 days a week.At the        
 swimming pool people can buy          
 refreshments and things to borrow to  
 play with in the pool. Most people in 
 our area use the pool occassionally.  
  There are leisure facilites in       
 Willington and Bishop Auckland, but it
 is too far to travel for most people, 
 but there is a new one opening up in  
 Eastgate so people can use it. There  
 are Scouts,Cubs,Guides and Brownies   
 and there are 5 youth clubs. The youth
 clubs have pool,snooker,table         
 tennis,basket ball and refreshments.  
 There is also a Silver Band,Tennis    
 club,Football Team,dancing club for   
 children,Keep Fit classes  and        
 Stanhope Choral Society.
