		<title>10THE RIVER EXE</title>
		<content>  At this point the valley is a        
 conservation area and nature          
 sanctuary.A variety of deciduous      
 hardwoods are found.Many younger trees
 have been planted with many alder     
 along the actual river and leat.A line
 of 176 lombardy poplars along the     
 perimeter of the University playing   
 fields is undergrown with many hazel, 
 chestnut,hawthorn and lime.Many wild  
 flowers are seen throughout the year. 
  The river is tidal as far as Salmon  
 Pool Weir where sea fish are caught.  
 There is a salmon ladder on the west  
 side of the weir.                     
 Leach's Pond is a sheltered pond below
 the tidal point where we caught a     
 variety of creatures.The leat flowing 
 through the pond has several derelict 
 mills,the oldest one being a grist    
 (flour) mill.The mill workers cottages
 are still inhabited after 150 years.  </content>
