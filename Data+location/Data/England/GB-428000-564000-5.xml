		<content> Mr Cobb has been headteacher at       
{Walkergate Junior}for five years.He   
 likes the people but not the building 
 which is about 70 yrs old.He would    
 like to remove the prefabs and gym to 
 make a grassed space.The windows,     
 doors,pipes and ceilings in our{school
 have been repaired often.There is a   
 big yard which we share with the      
 infants.The school is surrounded by   
 busy roads so Mr Webb,Mr Buzzeo and   
 Mrs Slade are our lollipop people.The 
 Puroh Milk Factory was demolished to  
 make our{Wildlife Garden.}Mr Jones    
 runs a{Leisure Centre}for children    
 twice a week.In addition to the usual 
 lessons, the First,Third and Fourth   
 year children swim at{Byker Swimming  
{Pool. }
