		<content>Horse racing: The "rubbing shed" still 
standing near the course where horses  
were rubbed down before being walked   
home is featured in old paintings.     
The courses are kept in excellent      
condition and the water is supplied    
from the Jockey Club bore hole.        
During the second world war the course 
was used by the R.A.F. and the Rowley  
Mile became the longest runway in      
Bomber Command. Light planes and       
helicopters connected with the racing  
industry now use the Heath.            
                                       
Swimming: The town's swimming pool     
is in this area and, although it is not
very large, now that it is heated is   
very well patronised all the year      
round.
