		<title>15Southam's Interesting People</title>
		<content>  We have many people in Southam with  
 interesting jobs. They all help us in 
 a different way. Our town{mayor}      
 follows a ten year tradition. The     
 first mayor was a pupil at St. Mary's 
 School. Our present mayor is a butcher
 just like his father was 50 years ago.
 In his role as mayor he wears no      
 ceremonial outfit, only a chain of    
 office. He leads the town council and 
 attends many meetings and social      
 functions. Many people go to him for  
 help with their problems.             
  Someone else who helps us is the     
{lollipop lady.}She has an important   
 but dangerous job because she has to  
 go into the middle of the road to     
 cross the children over. So she can be
 seen she wears a hat and a white and  
 orange coat and she carries a stick   
 which looks like a large lollipop.    
 Southam has had 3 lollipop ladies.    </content>
