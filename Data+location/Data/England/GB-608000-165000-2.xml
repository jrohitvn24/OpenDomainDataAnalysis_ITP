		<content> Some people say that they have seen   
 ghosts in Whitstable,at the Ten       
 O'Clock shop which is a general store 
 in Canterbury Road.They say that the  
 ghost was a very young girl of about  
 twelve years old.She is said to have  
 been a witch so the people of the town
 burnt her.She seems to be in a fire,  
 screaming.In Saint Alphege School     
 there is said to be a ghost who rises 
 from a stone block and then puts on a 
 grey cloak.She walks around and then  
 disappears.There is a ghost in a      
 housing estate called Doggerel Acre   
 which is of a young maid who has moved
 from a road not far away, no one knows
 who she is but she is said to have    
 been seen quite a few times this year.
 Several people have reported seeing a 
 horse and carriage in Joy Lane, driven
 by men in Georgian costume.
