		<title>18The River Otter at Salterton</title>
		<content> The River Otter is a very quiet place 
 with some enjoyable walks.Only rarely 
 is an{otter}seen .The water is very   
 clear and you can see the fish        
 swimming below.There are few cars     
 around to make a noise.               
 In and around the river there are many
 kind of animals and other wild life.  
 Sometimes you can see a{tawny owl}up  
 in a tree.On the banks of grass in the
 saltmarshes are a couple of nests of  
{mute swans}which have returned here   
 for several years.One of the more     
 common birds you will see is the      
{herring gull}.There are several       
{kestrels}that may be seen hovering    
 around,probably after{mice.           
 The fishing is good and the three most
 common fish are{mullet,pike and trout.
 Beyond the saltmarsh is the estuary   
 and the sea.                          
                                       </content>
