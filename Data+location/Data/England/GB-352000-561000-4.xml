		<content>  During the period of time in which   
 the survey took place, there were two 
 exhibitions in Brampton. The first one
 was concerned with the renovation and 
 preservation of old buildings plus the
 addition of some new buildings        
 specially designed to blend with the  
 old ones. Plans were shown of what was
 to take place with photographs and    
 artists impressions of what the area  
 would look like on completion. The    
 renovation of the old buildings is due
 to a private organisation known as the
 Brampton Preservation Trust which was 
 formed in 1981.                       
  The second exhibition was called     
 'Brampton in the Past' and consisted  
 of a display of old photographs,      
 school records, business accounts, and
 local events which took place mainly  
 in the 19th century.
