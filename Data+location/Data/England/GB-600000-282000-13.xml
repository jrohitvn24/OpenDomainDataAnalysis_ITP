		<title>13Newsheet For N. Lopham</title>
		<content>      The Lophams' News is a monthly   
 newsheet for North and South Lopham.  
 Its aim is to give publicity and      
 information about events that are     
 important to the two villages.  In the
 Lophams' News for July 1985 we found  
 several items about North Lopham.     
 First, it mentioned  St.Andrew's      
 School Fair - proceeds will go to     
 school fund.  This fund helps pay for 
 school items and sponsors the         
 education of Raja an Indian boy.      
                                       
      Also mentioned was the North     
 Lopham lane walk, to help keep        
 footpaths open, as many are closed off
 by farmers these days.  St. Andrew's  
 school are leading the walk.  The     
 North Lopham Village sign is also     
 mentioned.   It will soon be erected  
 by the pond.  We do not yet know what 
 will be on the sign.                  </content>
