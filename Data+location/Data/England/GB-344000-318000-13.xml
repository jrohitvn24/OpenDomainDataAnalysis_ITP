<title>13Number of Houses and Population of Bomere Heath</title>
<content>

It would appear there is an error in the 1986 text where it states the number of houses in Bomere Heath as 8 in 1947. In the early 1800's there were about 40 which had risen to about 70 in 1890 and 76 in 1954. After this there was a dramatic rise with the number reaching 447 in 1976 (the nearest date to the Domesday Project for which I have a figure) and 579 today (2011).&lt;br />&lt;br />The population figure is more difficult to obtain but I would suggest that the 2,500 estimate in 1986 was quite a lot higher than the real figure which was probably nearer 1,300 allowing for an average of three people per house. The occupancy level is probably nearer 2.5 per house in 2011 giving a total population of about 1,500 people in 2011.&lt;br />&lt;br />Further information about the village can be found on the Bomere Heath website&lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
