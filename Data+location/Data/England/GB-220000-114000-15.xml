		<title>15Morwenstow - Beaches</title>
		<content> Beaches here  are  only  accessible at
 low  tide  by  scrambling  over  rocky
 ridges from a neighbouring more access
 ible beach. Cliffs can only be scaled 
 with extreme  care. They are  high and
 steep   with  a  zig - zag  geological
 formation. The rivers plunge over the 
 cliffs forming spectacular waterfalls.
 There are several very large rocks not
 covered  by the sea  which are nesting
 places for gulls and shags. On a  warm
 summer day seals can be seen  hunting 
 for fish in sandy bottomed pools.  The
 flowers on  the  cliff edge and  rocky
 slopes   are   superb,  especially  in
 spring and early summer.              
 There are no large stretches  of sand,
 only   boulders  of  many  shapes  and
 sizes rounded  by  the sea. Hennacliff
 is the highest  cliff on  this  bit of
 coastline.  It can be best viewed from
 a small boat fishing for lobsters.    </content>
