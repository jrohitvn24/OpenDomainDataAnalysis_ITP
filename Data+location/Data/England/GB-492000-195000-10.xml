		<title>10CURZON COMBINED SCHOOL</title>
		<content> This present school was built in 1961 
 on the site of a much older one. It   
 was intended for 60 children maximum, 
 but as the roll grew to 250 we had to 
 have 4 transportable classrooms (one a
 double). Due to falling rolls we now  
 have 150 children.                    
 Mr Thomas, who retired last year, was 
 headmaster for 33 years, and Mr Birch 
 is our new head. We have 5 teachers (3
 Junior and 2 infant), and a welfare   
 assistant. There are 35 children in   
 our class; our teacher is Mrs Lusby.  
 Most of us come quite a long way      
 because our parents think it is such a
 good school.                          
 We have a school uniform of maroon and
 grey, and pink dresses for girls in   
 the summer.We have a school badge     
 which our deputy head, Mrs Beckett    
 designed using the Curzon             
 coat-of-arms.                         </content>
