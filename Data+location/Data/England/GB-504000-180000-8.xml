		<content> The M25 Outer Orbital route around    
 London will soon complete the 118 mile
 long loop of motorway around the outer
 regions of London. The original       
 concept was formulated before the WW2.
 After much consultation/protest       
 construction began in the late 1970s. 
 In 1985 the building is almost        
 complete .The 118 mile route should be
 fully operational by the end of 1986. 
 The busiest sections have been        
 specially adapted for heavy traffic_  
 the first British motorway to have    
 four lanes. At least 3 service areas  
 are planned though decisions about    
 where to place them have yet to be    
 made. The M25 should lessen congestion
 on London streets. The route will     
 cross the M4 close to the existing M4/
 A4 interchange at Langley passing     
 through the area east of Yiewsley.
