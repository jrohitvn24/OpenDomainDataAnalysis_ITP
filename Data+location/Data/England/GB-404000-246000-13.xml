		<title>13The Strawberry Pickers.</title>
		<content> On the second of July I interviewed   
 Mrs. Careless and Mrs.Dawe who work   
 six hours casual labour picking       
 strawberries.Mrs.Careless can pick    
 about eighty pounds in a day .She     
 doesn't get paid piece work.Six other 
 people work with them.None of the     
 workers work on Friday because there  
 is no market.They also pick potatoes  
 leeks,spring onions,cucumbers,sprouts 
 and small carrots depending on the    
 season.The growers sell the           
 strawberries etc.at market and at the 
 farm shops.They keep the strawberries 
 in cold storage.They spray the        
 strawberries before they are picked.  
 The strawberry season lasts three to  
 four weeks.The strawberries have a    
 strong scent.The ladies eat the odd   
 strawberry now and then,and when      
 the ladies get home they can't sit    
 down because they get back ache.      </content>
