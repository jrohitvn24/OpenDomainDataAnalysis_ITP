		<title>10Debenham;cottage renovation.</title>
		<content>  Since 1960,many farm cottages have   
been sold and renovated with grant aid.
This has resulted in some very         
attractive restoration to about 75% of 
the old cottages.Extensions were needed
to most cottages since in their        
original state there were no toilets   
other than garden privies and no bath- 
rooms.                                 
  The influx of people into an         
expanding village has made for higher  
expectations with regard to housing and
sanitation.                            
  The district council has been fairly 
liberal in its approach to planning    
permission,yet has managed to prevent  
inappropriate alterations.Prices for   
period cottages compare favourably with
other parts of south-eastern England.  
  There is a lack of housing in the    
middle price-range in Debenham,driving 
prospective first-time purchasers away.</content>
