		<content> It is said that sheep are responsible 
 for the springy texture of the turf on
 Salisbury Plain. It is also           
 particularly rich in the wild flowers 
 that grow around this area. Wild      
 Orchids are our prize exhibit and up  
 to twenty varieties grow on the downs,
 some of which are rare and should{NOT}
 be picked because of the slow germana-
 tion of the seeds, which sometimes    
 take several years to come into       
 flower.                               
 Butterflies also thrive on our down-  
 land and those commonly seen are: Dark
 Green Fritillary, Marbled White and   
 the Small Blue. Two varieties which   
 are exclusive in this particular part 
 of the Plain are The Adonis Blue and  
 The Chalk Hill Blue, whose cater-     
 pillars feed on the Horseshoe Vetch   
 with its tiny golden flowers.
