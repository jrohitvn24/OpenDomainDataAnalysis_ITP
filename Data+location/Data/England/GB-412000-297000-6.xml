Foxes are to be found in numerous      
places all over the housing areas of   
the block. They have adapted from      
being forced out of their natural      
homes when houses were built between   
and after the world wars.              
They are seen mostly at night around   
dustbins but can often be found        
sleeping under trees near houses in    
the daytime. It is not uncommon for    
them to be seen walking boldly down    
suburban streets. At night they can be 
heard calling to each other by barking 
like dogs. One family has been seen    
digging holes to make a home in the    
railway embankment beside St.Joseph's  
R.C. Combined School in the SW corner  
of the block. They were not even       
distracted by the numbers of children  
and parents who stood watching them.
