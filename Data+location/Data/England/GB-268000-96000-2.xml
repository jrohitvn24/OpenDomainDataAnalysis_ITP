		<title>02GETTING TO SCHOOL.</title>
		<content>   There are seventeen children in this
 class,many of us come from farming    
 families.Before we come to school some
 of us have jobs to do like helping    
 with milking,feeding our ponies and   
 other pets.                           
   Seven children live too far away to 
 walk to school and have to come to    
 school by car or truck.One girl comes 
 by Land Rover because her farm track  
 is too rough for a car.               
   One day during the winter only six  
 people could get through the snow and 
 some of those had to leave early in   
 case they could not get home.         
   One girl helps her mother to make   
 clotted cream which she sells.The     
 Queen once had some of this.          
   Other children's farms provide us   
 with milk,potatoes,eggs and hay and   
 straw to feed our animals.
