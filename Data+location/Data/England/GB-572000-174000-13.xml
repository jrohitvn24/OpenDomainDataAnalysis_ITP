		<title>13Cooling Church</title>
		<content>The second claim to fame is to be found
in the graveyard next to the parish    
church of St.James.The area around     
Higham,Rochester and Chatham is steeped
in Dickensian history.Here are found 13
lozenge shaped grave stones.They are   
the children of the Comport family and 
all reference to the children suggests 
they were under 2 years of age when    
they died.It is thought they died of   
marsh fever,or malaria.However,these   
same lozenge grave stones are claimed  
to be the ones referred to by Pip in   
"Great Expectations".Other villages    
have similar claims but it is known    
that the lower Thames along this coast 
had the very convict ships moored as   
mentioned in the story.
