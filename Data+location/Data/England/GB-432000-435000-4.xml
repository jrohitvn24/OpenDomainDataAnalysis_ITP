		<content>  Easterley Rd (A58) is part of the    
 main road from Leeds to Wetherby and  
 the  Great North Road(A1).  It is very
 busy with local and long distance     
 traffic.  Until a few years ago it was
 used by many very big                 
 lorries, some of which carried loads  
 which would be dangerous in an        
 accident.  People living along the A58
 (including Easterley Rd) pursuaded the
 government to ban such vehicles, which
 now bring danger to the A64 Leeds to  
 York Rd instead. Easterley Rd is lined
 on both sides by houses of a good     
 standard and separated by their       
 gardens from the road.  It is a dual  
 carriageway road with a grassy strip  
 dividing traffic travelling in        
 opposite directions. This helps to    
 make it safer for traffic, but does   
 encourags drivers to travel too fast  
 for pedestrian safety.                </content>
