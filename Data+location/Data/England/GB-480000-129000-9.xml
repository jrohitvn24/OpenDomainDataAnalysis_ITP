		<title>09LAND USE</title>
		<content>        The land in our area is used   
 for many different things.It is used  
 mostly for army camps and housing.    
 There are also a few shops like news- 
 agents and supermarkets.There are also
 some public places around,such as pubs
 ,toilets,carparks and centres.        
       The housing in this area is     
 rather expensive because of these     
 reasons.                              
 1.because Liphook is on the route to  
 London along the A3.                  
 2.because it is not far to the coast  
 and it is nearly all motorway to      
 places like Southsea.                 
 3.because Liphook is near to London,in
 the comuter belt.                     
       The land will later be used for 
 a bypass to go from Liphook to Peters-
 field.It will make travelling quicker 
 and there won't be so many long delays
 as there is at the moment.            </content>
