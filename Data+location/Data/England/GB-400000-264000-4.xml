    "Cats got the measles,             
     Dogs got the flu,                 
     Chickens got the chickenpox,      
     And out goes you."                
 You cross and uncross your legs to the
 rhyme. If you land with legs crossed  
 you pull one sock down. When both     
 socks are down you are out.           
              POLO                     
 There is a caller,the others stand in 
 a line.The caller calls out something 
 like "trees" all the others whisper a 
 kind of tree to a messenger that the  
 caller has chosen. The messenger tells
 the caller all the different trees the
 others have chosen but not who has    
 chosen which.The caller then calls out
 the name of a tree. The person who    
 chose that tree races the caller to   
 the wall. The last one of the 2 is the
 new caller.                           </content>
