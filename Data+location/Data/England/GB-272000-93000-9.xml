		<content> There are no shops in this area, the  
 nearest being at Cheriton Bishop, but 
 there are a surprising number of free 
 deliveries including daily milk and   
 post, except Sundays, bread twice a   
 week, meat, a travelling grocers shop,
 coal, bottled gas, paraffin and a     
 mobile library. There is also a weekly
 bus service to Crediton. Most         
 properties have a large garden up to  
 several acres and use the land in a   
 variety of ways; to supplement their  
 income, pursue a hobby and to produce 
 some of their own food, from animals; 
 house-cows, goats, ducks, chicken and 
 bees, and by growing their own fruit  
 and vegetables. Much is preserved in  
 deep-freezers while several people    
 make cheese, cream, wine, jam and     
 pickles. Pets kept include cats, dogs,
 horses, ponies, peacocks, ferrets and 
 a parrot.                             </content>
