		<title>08Hobbies on Horse-Eye Level</title>
		<content> Horse-Eye Level is close to Hailsham &amp;
 Eastbourne and is visited by people   
 from these towns for recreation. The  
 many dykes and rivers used for fishing
 by Hailshams Memorial Institute and   
 Angling Club are by permit only. The  
 main fish caught are Roach, Perch and 
 Rud. The Pevensey Marsh Beagles       
 sometimes stray into the area but it  
 is not their main course. The massive 
 variety of wildlife and flora attract 
 nature lovers from all over the       
 county. Local Rambling Clubs visit the
 area &amp; use the many footpaths. Sadly, 
 often signposts indicating footpaths  
 have disappeared, possibly through    
 lack of use at some time and some have
 even been fenced over. This may       
 indicate a lack of interest of public 
 right of way across land or an attempt
 by landowners to deter the public from
 walking across their land.            </content>
