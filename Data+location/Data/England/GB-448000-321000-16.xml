		<content> Village people tend to wait for the   
 newcomers to introduce themselves.In  
 Hathern village in particular the     
 "old" villagers tend to keep          
 themselves apart from the newcomers_  
 more or less implying the village     
 belongs to them and they are          
 intruders.Nevertheless they can be    
 charmed round when they are more sure 
 of the "intruders".                   
     Once a friendship has been        
 established this will probably be a   
 lifelong thing.                       
     Newcomers to the villages complain
 they find it difficult to make friends
 because people keep themselves to     
 themselves until they know you.The    
 easiest way to meet people is to meet 
 other parents collecting children from
 school.
