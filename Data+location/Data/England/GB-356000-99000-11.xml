		<title>11Churches at Cattistock</title>
		<content> The church of St. Peter and St. Paul  
 at Cattistock is of Saxon origin and  
 was refashioned in 1857.  The splendid
 tower, 8 bells, good baptistry and    
 fine coloured windows are notable.    
 The church, seating 200, depends on a 
 team ministry of one rector and two   
 vicars and has a roll of 70.  Weekly  
 services with organ (no choir) are    
 attended by 10-15 persons.  Sunday    
 school.  No marriages since 1983; more
 recently, only one baptism and nine   
 funerals.  "The Chimes" news sheet is 
 distributed each month.               
 Cattistock's Methodist Chapel, built  
 in the 19th century, is no longer in  
 use.                                  
 The church of St Mary at Wraxall,     
 with beginnings in the 12th century,  
 was restored in the 19th century.     
 Particularly small, the church is     
 attended by 8-20 persons.             </content>
