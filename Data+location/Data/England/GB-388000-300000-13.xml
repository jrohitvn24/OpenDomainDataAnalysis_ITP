		<title>13VALLEY PARK</title>
		<content>Valley Park (sometimes called the      
Linear Park) is a former railway line  
which has been turned into a footpath  
from Aldersley to Castlecroft.It then  
links with the existing footpath along 
the line to Wombourne.The park closely 
follows the Staffordshire and          
Worcestershire Canal.                  
The park is used for nature study,bird 
watching and dog walking.Some people   
simply walk while others run for       
exercise.It is also used by motor      
cyclists and horse riders,although this
is illegal.Some people use Valley Park 
as a short cut to get to work and many 
children use it to walk to nearby      
schools.                               
Near St. Michael's School is the old   
Tettenhall Station which is currently  
being renovated.Like some other parts  
of the park it has suffered from       
vandalism in recent years.             </content>
