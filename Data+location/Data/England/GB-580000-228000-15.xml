		<content> The{chairman of our governors}has been
 on the town council for 17 years. Her 
 father was on the council for 30      
 years. So between them they have seen 
 many changes in Halstead. When she was
 a little girl she remembered going on 
 a steam train from Halstead to Clacton
 for half a days visit. That was her   
 only holiday. Now the disused railway 
 line is used as a pony track. She used
 to come to our school when it was a   
 secondary school. Now it is a primary 
 school.  That was during the war and  
 she only came for half days as there  
 were evacuees from London here and    
 there was not enough room for everyone
 to attend at the same time. In the    
 main street, next to the library,     
 used to be the bus park. Now they are 
 busy building flats on the site.
