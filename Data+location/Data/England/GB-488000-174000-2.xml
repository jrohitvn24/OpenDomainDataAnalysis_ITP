		<title>02Long Lane Farm,Touchen End.</title>
		<content>  This farm with it's 30 acres is owned
 and run by a lady whose father owned  
 it until his death.This lady is a keen
{conservationist}and{no insecticides}  
 are used.There are 15 cows and 11     
 calves-four being the{rare breed}the  
 Belted Galloway and the remainder are 
 Devon Reds.All are raised as prime    
 beef mainly for export.The cows are   
 single suckle cows which means no     
 milking is done.Cereals are not grown 
 and hay making of the rye grass is    
 contracted out.Also on the farm are 2 
 piglets,32 Pure Maran or Rhode Island 
 Red/Light Sussex chicks,4 goslings and
 2 geese.We saw a dew pond in the      
 corner of a field.It was overgrown and
 few creatures live in it.The pond is  
 built on a bed of London clay.The lady
 wants to encourage wild flowers,birds,
 insects and creatures to flourish on  
 her farm.                             </content>
