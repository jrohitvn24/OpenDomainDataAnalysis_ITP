		<content>   {Anzani House}is a large office     
 block owned by{British Telecom .      
 Research work is carried out there    
 into developing new communicatiom     
 systems. A switchboard has been       
 invented which can handle all the     
 incoming calls worked by only one     
 person and it can show on its screen a
 directory of all the people and their 
 phone numbers.Some phones are a       
 conbination of computer, calculator   
 and recording machine.To test the     
 phones a special anechoic room is     
 needed which has no echo or sound     
 reverberation.This is done by covering
 the entire room, even the floor, in   
 foam which absorbs the sound.         
    One of the many laboratories tests 
 and designs new telephones which can  
 look like flowers pots,aeroplanes or  
 cartoon characters.
