		<title>08THE ATHENA B</title>
		<content>   In January 1980,a large cargo ship  
 ran aground on the beach a little east
 of the Palace Pier at high tide in a  
 severe storm.                         
  Thousands of sightseers came to      
 Brighton to see the stranded          
 vessel,and soon,the storekeepers      
 reopened their shops closed for the   
 winter and began selling souvenirs and
 refreshments and made quite a profit  
 from the visitors.                    
  On February 14th,an unusually high   
 tide was expected.and an attempt was  
 made to refloat the vessel.Sightseers 
 came to witness the event and the main
 roads to Brighton were jammed with    
 traffic.It was estimated that the     
 crowd reached 3OOOO.Against the       
 bookies odds of 6 to 4 the vessel was 
 refloated.
