		<content>  The milk given by the cows has to be 
 kept below 4 degrees Celsius otherwise
 the dairy would not buy it.The milk is
 stored in a jar before being cleaned  
 and collected by the dairy from where 
 it can go to any part of the country. 
  The farm has one bull,which is three 
 years old.All the young male calves   
 are sold at the market.The            
 Galloway bull is black and very large.
  The cattle are not the only animals  
 on the farm.There are 10 ducks,often  
 to be seen on the village pond and 10 
 chickens.The hens are 5 months old and
 eat 6 ounces of grain a day.
