		<title>15Interview: a local resident</title>
		<content>    Mrs.Raine lived in Evenwood, but   
 she moved to Ingleton after a bomb    
 dropped on her doorstep in{1916}. She 
 lived at no.1 Church View, then moved 
 to Smithson House opposite.           
    Mrs. Raine enjoys living in        
 Ingleton and thought there were no    
 drawbacks.                            
    As a child Mrs.Raine went to the   
 old{Ingleton School}, it was the first
 school in County Durham to have a     
 wireless. They later bought a         
 gramophone which was later stolen, but
 fortunately it was found down Green   
 Lane.                                 
    When{John Wesley}was preaching in  
 Barnard Castle the people began to    
 stone him.He was taken for safety to a
 forefather of Mrs. R. Raine and given 
 a meal, and Mrs.Raine is the proud    
 possessor of the dinner plate from    
 which he ate his meal.{By M.Burton    </content>
