		<title>13REV.MIDDLETONS WORK.  (2)</title>
		<content> Rev.Middleton said the difference     
 between town Parsons and country      
 Parsons is that town Parsons don't get
 to know the people in town as well as 
 country Parsons do in a village like  
 Easthorpe.This is because people are  
 coming and going in the town and      
 haven't got the time to get to know   
 the Parson very well.The country      
 Parson gets to know some of the       
 families very much indeed so when     
 things happen to them it's easier for 
 him to help because he knows their    
 family.He said he enjoys his work but 
 he's also a human being and there are 
 some parts of his work that he doesn't
 enjoy as much as others.He likes      
 people and thinks they are            
 interesting.They're sometimes         
 difficult but none the less they are  
 always interesting.Being with         
 people is part of his work.           </content>
