		<title>14Acton Trussell shop.</title>
		<content>  This local shop provides a community 
service.  The shopkeeper will deliver  
food and other requirements to the     
elderly in the village, to outlying    
farm and houses, to people who are ill 
or without a car.                      
  Many of the locals travel out of the 
village for goods and this shop only   
provides small necessities.  Most tend 
to go to Stafford to either Kwiksave   
or Sainsbury's.  The shop in the       
village is used most often for its     
Post Office facilities and for         
newspapers.  The Post Office was shut  
down for a period of six months but    
the locals objected and it was         
reopened.  The shopkeeper employs two  
part time assistants to help him with  
his work.
