		<content> The present house standing in         
 Wakefield Estate was built in 1740 by 
 the Duke of Grafton to a design by    
 William Kent on the site of an old    
 hunting lodge once used by Oliver     
 Cromwell's son-in-law. The Victorians 
 added new rooms but these have been   
 removed and the house is now very much
 as it was. There are 25 rooms and the 
 Parish Boundary runs through the      
 middle of the house. The large gardens
 were laid out by Capability Brown and 
 the estate contains some old oak trees
 reputed to be 1000 years old. Until   
 1788 the Wakefield Lawn Races were    
 held on the estate. Now the estate    
 functions as a mixed farm and quality 
 horses are also bred there. There are 
 several farm workers houses on the    
 estate which  covers about 800        
 hectares.
