		<content>{Warrington Rugby League Football Club}
    The present club was founded in    
 1879 but, originally, played Rugby    
 Union. Thirteen-a-side rugby began in 
 1895.                                 
    The "Wires" nickname of the team   
 came from the wire-drawing industry   
 which was once prominent in the town. 
    The present ground-capacity is     
 13,500 but it once held 30,000 people.
 A fire in 1983 destroyed the main     
 stand, but the new South Stand holds  
 2,000 spectators.                     
    The club is at present in debt,    
 owing to the rebuilding, but the      
 weekly 'gate' money is insufficient to
 cover normal running costs.           
 Consequently sponsorship plays an     
 important part in the club's finances.
 Television coverage of the game is    
 paid for into a "pool" which is fairly
 distributed amongst the league clubs. </content>
