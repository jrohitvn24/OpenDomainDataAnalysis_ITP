		<content> Near the houses in Crabtree road there
 are allotments, shops, a children's   
 park, a playing field, a Brownie hut  
 and a junior school.                  
                                       
 Crabtree road is a cul-de-sac and at  
 the end is a railway line.            
                                       
 Overlooking the children's park is an 
{old peoples home.}They like watching  
 the{children}playing, and sometimes   
 one of the old ladies is the referee  
 in a game of football.                
                                       
 The elderly people go on outings,     
 have coffee mornings and hold parties 
 to which any old people can go.       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
