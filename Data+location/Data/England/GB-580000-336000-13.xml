		<content> Farming is still an important employer
 in Stanhoe, but the majority of those 
 in work travel to Fakenham or King's  
 Lynn to the factories, garages or     
 shops.  There is no transport that    
 fits in with work times so cars are   
 shared and some youngsters use        
 scooters or motorbikes.  The largest  
 category of all is the self-employed  
 and this includes a builder, plumber, 
 heating engineer, carpenter, painter  
 and decorator, jig-saw puzzle maker,  
 coach and carriage builder, shop      
 owner, writer, corn merchant, car     
 mechanic and electrician.  Over half  
 the population are however, retired,  
 and a small number coming from former 
 life in a town to enjoy their         
 retirement in the country.            
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
