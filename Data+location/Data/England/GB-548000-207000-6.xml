 favourable. They are then sorted &amp;    
 bagged; a task performed by women who 
 are employed from November to March.  
 The crop averages 1000 tonnes per year
 The wheat crop is sown in September of
 the year prior to harvest. One of the 
 farmworkers used to live in nearby    
 Matching but the steady reduction of  
 rented accomodation due to purchase by
 retired buyers &amp; commuters has caused 
 him to move to Harlow New Town;only 10
 minutes drive away.On land near to    
 Roffey Hall, pheasants are bred by a  
 retired London plumber. About 100 are 
 released for the annual 'shoot'.Of    
 these around 30 fall to the guns. In  
 the interests of wild life            
 conservation the shoot is only        
 repeated annually.The same man is     
 employed to destroy vermin-rabbits
