		<title>08Police Sharlston/Crofton</title>
		<content> Sharlston and Crofton are policed by 3
 community policemen. They are based in
 an office at Crofton but the nearest  
 police station is at Normanton. The   
 policemen walk or bicycle around but  
 can call 2 cars as back up. Our local 
 policemen trained at Harrogate. P.C.  
 Goulding, one of the local men, has   
 been a policeman for 12 years. He     
 works 56 hours a week with 1 weekend a
 month off duty. He works shifts 6 a.m.
 - 2 p.m. or 2 p.m. - 10 p.m. or 10    
 p.m. - 6 a.m. The crime he most often 
 has to deal with is vandalism. In our 
 area there is also a police driving   
 school. There, policemen are taught to
 drive to a higher standard as well as 
 to drive all sorts of police vehicles.
