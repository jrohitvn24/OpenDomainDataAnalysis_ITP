		<title>06INTERVIEWING A RESIDENT</title>
		<content> My partner and I went to interview    
 Mrs.Ormston.We asked her twenty five  
 questions.She and her family are the  
 newest people who have come to        
 Littleton.Here are two questions which
 we asked Mrs.Ormston.Do you have a big
 house?She said yes.What kind of job do
 you do for a living?She is a maths    
 teacher and a mother.                 
  Mrs.Ormston moved into Littleton     
 because her husband works in          
 Winchester and where they used to live
 it would take  an hour to get to work 
 and an hour back.They also  moved to  
 Littleton because her children were at
 Private  Schools and it took too long 
 to get to their school.Now it takes   
 about half an hour to get to work and 
 it takes about half an hour to take   
 her children to school.Mrs.Ormston has
 got brown curly hair and she is very  
 kind!                                 </content>
