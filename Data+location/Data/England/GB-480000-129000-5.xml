       Bohunt Manor was built in 1934 -
 1936 and it was altered in 1974.  The 
 Barns are dated to 1979.  It has got a
 lake which is a natural lake.  The dam
 is about 100 years old.  It keeps     
 animals like Beef cattle, ducks and   
 geese.  It is open to the public and  
 and the pubilc pay  10p for children  
 and 50p for adults.  This money goes  
 towards world wildlife funds.  Lady   
 Holman owns it and, she has given it  
 to the wildlife.  The peaceful park is
 open to the public but the house      
 isn't.  It is lovely to sit down and  
 spot a rabbit or squirrel running up a
 tree.  The Manor takes up 132 acres of
 land and it takes 4 gareners to look  
 after it, Bohunt school was named     
 after the manor as the school was     
 built on the Bohunt manors land.
