     The Wheal Eliza mine first opened 
 in the sixteenth century that the     
 greatest efforts were made to extract 
 the iron ore.The Wheal Eliza,in the   
 Barle Valley about one mile south of  
 Simonsbath,was developed by Frederick 
 Knight.He spent a great deal of money 
 on the mine and on preparing the route
 for a railway to transport the ore to 
 Porlock Weir. Knight began work in    
 1856 but two years later he was forced
 to abandon the project.               
                                       
     In 1985 the ruined buildings at   
 the mine can clearly be seen and the  
 waste of the mine clearly shows traces
 of iron ore.
