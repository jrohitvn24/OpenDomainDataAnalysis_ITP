		<content> doubles also as the village hall and  
 so is quite large.  The village hall  
 has quite a lot of PE apparatus, a    
 pine floor and a ceiling with         
 sky-lights.  In the main building of  
 the school there is not a lot of glass
 but the school is by no means dark.   
 There are five classrooms, a          
 committee/meeting room above the hall,
 music room and a conservatory which   
 has been commondeered as a computer   
 room.  Two of the classrooms are      
 temporary, free standing huts which   
 need replacing.                       
      Each of the classes has 30-35    
 pupils in it.  The school has large   
 playing fields and a large playground.
      The pupils interviewed all       
 enjoyed there education at the school.
 Pupils favourite lessons were PE,     
 music and maths.  They all like their 
 teachers too.  School starts at 9am   </content>
