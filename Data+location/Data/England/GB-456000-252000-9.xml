		<title>09FARMING IN PRESTON CAPES</title>
		<content> The pattern of farming to the south of
 the village has changed over the last 
 ten years. Hedges have disappeared to 
 accommodate large scale arable        
 farming. Increased mechanisation      
 combined with this has redically      
 reduced the number of people dependent
 on the land for their livelihood. The 
 area if predominantly arable. The     
 majority of the land being part of a  
 larger unit. The large machinery now  
 used causes problems on the narrow    
 country lanes. There are seven working
 farms. Two are arable. One fattens    
 beef cattle. The rest mix arable and  
 livestock farming in a more           
 traditional way. Only one of these has
 a dairy herd. Another trains race     
 horses alongside farming activities.
