		<content>   Also in our area there is a large   
 green by Hillrise.  On the green there
 are play things such as a slide, a    
 roundabout and a rocket.              
                                       
   The village hall is on the corner of
 Ladywood Road.  There are lots of     
 activities held in the village hall   
 like Cubs, bingo for Old Age          
 Pensioners and pre-school playgroup.  
                                       
   The British Legion Hall is on the   
 main road.  Here they have jumble     
 sales and bingo.                      
                                       
   The 423 bus goes through the        
 village.  One way it goes to Dartford 
 and Swanley and the other way it goes 
 to Longfield and New Ash Green.
