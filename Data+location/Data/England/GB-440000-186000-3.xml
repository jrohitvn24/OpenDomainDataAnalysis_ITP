 Both priests were celebrating their   
first Easter in Wantage in 1985,and    
they decided to start Holy Week by     
processing from Holy Trinity (Charlton)
to the Parish Church of St.Peter and   
St.Paul.                               
   Parishioners met in the car-park at 
Charlton where Father Robert Wright    
(Priest-in-Charge) said prayers, and   
and the Curate (Father Simon Evans)    
sprinkled holy water on them and       
blessed crosses made from palm leaves. 
  Everyone then lined up and formed a  
procession.About 200 people walked     
through the town singing hymns and     
carrying the palm crosses.Those who    
could not walk so far met them at      
the Church. A special service was      
then held and it was followed by       
coffee.                                
                                       </content>
