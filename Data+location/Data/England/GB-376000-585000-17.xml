		<content> Three men were at work, shearing with 
 electric clippers.  Each shearer      
 caught his own sheep, took it out of  
 the pen to a board laid on the ground 
 to keep the wool clean.  Here he      
 turned the ewe until she was sitting  
 on her rump supported by his legs.    
 Taking the shears he began with the   
 belly wool then the tail.  Starting at
 the neck, he made long, sweeping      
 strokes over the sides towards the    
 tail.  When one side and the back were
 sheared, he turned the ewe and        
 continued on the other side.  The     
 fleece fell to the floor.  A dab of   
 red keel and the ewe was released.    
 The shearer spread out the fleece,    
 turned in the edges and rolled it -   
 clean side in- into a neat bundle     
 secured by a twist of wool.  The whole
 process had taken 2 minutes 28        
 seconds.                              </content>
