		<title>10RAILWAYS IN CARLISLE</title>
		<content>  Carlisle is a 'railway city' that    
 grew and expanded to serve the railway
 companies.The housing bordering our   
 block in Denton Holme was built for   
 the railway workers. My dad works on  
 the railway, he is employed by        
{British Rail.}He has to go under the  
 trains to maintain and repair them. He
 likes his job.                        
     The railways have got better over 
 the years, although some people think 
 it is still quite expensive to travel 
 by train. One thing I hate is the     
 price of food on the trains. The      
 latest slogan for{British Rail}is     
{"We're getting there."                
     A close look at a map of Carlisle 
 shows our block to be crossed by four 
 routes, the main London to Glasgow,   
 Carlisle to Newcastle, Carlisle to    
 West Cumbria and the Carlisle to      
 Settle line.                          </content>
