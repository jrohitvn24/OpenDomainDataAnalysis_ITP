		<title>01Area along A580 N.of Worsley</title>
		<content>{Location}-area covered is North of the
 A580 from Mosley Common in West to    
 Wardley Wood in East.This includes the
 motorway intersection M61-62,A580 and 
 the district of Ellenbrook.           
{History}-much of the area in the past 
 was associated with farming.As coal   
 was discovered small independent      
 shafts were sunk,later joining to form
 Mosley Common Colliery in the West.   
{Transport}-the railway line(dismantled
 in 1966)from Wigan to M'cr ran North  
 of the main colliery site.The East    
 Lancs Rd.(A580)opened in 1936 provides
 access to Manchester and Liverpool.   
 This links with the M62 East and M61  
 South.                                
{Residential}-housing in the area is   
 divided into 2 main blocks constructed
 chiefly during the last 30 years.     
 Property is owner-occupied &amp; leasehold
 mainly from Bridgewater Estate.       </content>
