		<title>16Billing Mill</title>
		<content>A mill has stood on this site for over 
900 years. In 1968 the owners of       
Billing Aquadrome converted the old and
half-derelict Billing Water Mill into a
a Milling museum. As many as 20,000    
people visit it a year. It is one of a 
long chain of water mills on the Nene  
Valley. The original eel trap can still
be seen next to the mill wheel. There  
are a collection of old grindstones    
including one dating from Roman times. 
On Wednesday 12th June we went to visit
the mill. It was interesting. The water
wheel made a noise. We saw a door near 
the roof, it was for loading the sacks 
of grain into the mill. There was a    
model of a windmill, it looked like a  
real windmill. There was a drive shaft 
from a mill at Cransley, near          
Kettering. There were lots of tools.   
A bell rang when the wheel went round. 
I liked going to the mill, it was good.</content>
