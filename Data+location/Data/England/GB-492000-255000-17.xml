 We also think that our Post Office and
 shop combined should be open more     
 often.It closes for a half day on     
 Wednesdays and on Saturdays, which    
 does not give children like me who go 
 to Music School in Bedford on Saturday
 mornings a chance to buy              
 anything!Saturday is a very busy day  
 and the lady who runs it would, I     
 think,get more money as well as giving
 the rest of us a chance to ruin our   
 teeth with sweets.
