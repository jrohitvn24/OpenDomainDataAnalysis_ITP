		<content> WE MET FOUR OF THE RETIRED PEOPLE IN  
 THE VILLAGE. ONE SPENT HOURS WORKING  
 IN HER DELIGHTFUL GARDEN, ENCOURAGING 
 BOTH CULTIVATED &amp; WILD FLOWERS. THE   
 VIEW AROUND HER COTTAGE IS BOTH       
 PEACEFUL &amp; AWE-INSPIRING. DRIVES HER  
 OWN CAR.                              
 NEXT WE MET A GENTLEMAN WHO ENJOYED   
 LIFE ENORMOUSLY. HAD NO SPARE TIME.   
 DID NOT KNOW HOW HE EVER FOUND TIME TO
 WORK. NO CAR, USED TWICE WEEKLY BUS   
 SERVICE.                              
 FINALLY WE MET ELDERLY TWIN SISTERS.  
 OWING TO RHEUMATISM, DEAFNESS &amp; THE   
 EFFECTS OF LONELINESS ( SOMETIMES NOT 
 SPEAKING TO ANYONE FOR 2 or 3 days)   
 COULD NOT LEAVE THE VILLAGE. ALL      
 SHOPPING DONE FROM VILLAGE SHOP. THEY 
 ENJOYED THEIR 'WILD' GARDEN, BOOKS    
 FROM LIBRARY VAN &amp; TELEVISION.        
 THE VILLAGE IS AN OASIS OF PEACE &amp;    
 BEAUTY. FOR SOME IT COULD BE A PRISON.</content>
