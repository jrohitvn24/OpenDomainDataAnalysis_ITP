		<title>18Farming in Collingham</title>
		<content> Living in Collingham was once very    
 dependent on farming.Many of the      
 village people were employed on farms,
 successive generations of families    
 earning a living from the land.Today  
 this is just not so.Many of the farms 
 have now either been given over to    
 housing development or have merged    
 with others to make larger units.There
 is not the mixed farming there once   
 was.At the moment{oil seed rape }is   
 very much the crop in demand.Also the 
 close proximity of the sugar factory  
 has encouraged farmers to plant{sugar 
{beet. }                               
 With the advent of larger and more    
 modern machinery,less people are      
 needed to work the land.Hedges are    
 taken up to make farming easier and   
 more profitable.This,of course,has its
 effect on the{wild life and general   
{ecology }of the area.                 </content>
