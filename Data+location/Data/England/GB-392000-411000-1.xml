		<content>{Milnrow}and{Newhey}are industrial     
 villages on the edge of Rochdale. They
 lie on the western edge of the        
 Pennines. In the last fifteen years   
 Milnrow has expanded with the         
 development of several housing estates
 and now has a population of about     
 12,000. The area originally known as  
 Butterworth became known as Milnrow   
 when a man called Milne built a row of
 houses for his mill workers. In the   
 past coal mining, cotton and woollen  
 mills were important in the area but  
 these have now closed and engineering 
 firms are the main employers.         
  Many farmhouses in the area date back
 to the 17th century for example       
 Moorbank Farm which was built in 1632.
 The farms are now mainly pastoral with
 dairy farming being the dominant form.
