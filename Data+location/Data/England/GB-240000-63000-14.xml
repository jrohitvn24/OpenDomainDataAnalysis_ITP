		<title>14Tamar Valley _ Halton Quay</title>
		<content> This natural quayside on the Cornish  
 bank of the Tamar is an attraction for
 tourism. It provides{recreation}in the
 form of fishing and has the facility  
 on its small stoney beach for         
 launching boats. Two adjacent cottages
 are available for self-catering       
 holiday accommodation. Lime kilns     
 still stand alongside the quay, a     
 reminder of its past industry, when   
 lime was brought to the area by boat  
 for use as a fertilizer for the land. 
 The{local history}of the quay has its 
 origin in{religion,}as it was here in 
 the 7th century that Irish Saints     
 Intract and Dominica landed and       
 brought Christianity to the area. In  
 commemoration of this there is a small
 chapel on the quay, where open air    
 services are regularly held in the    
 summer months, at the instigation of  
 the local parish priest of St.Dominic.</content>
