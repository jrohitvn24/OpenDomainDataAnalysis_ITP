		<title>11A Day IN The Life Of Fiona 2</title>
		<content>  Fiona spends her time after tea      
reading before it is time to get ready 
for bed.At 7.50 Fiona usually goes     
upstairs to have a wash,brush her teeth
and put on her night clothes."I then go
back downstairs and have a drink of    
cocoa." "I then go up to bed and my mum
and dad come up after a while to check 
that I am not messing around!" Fiona   
told us that during the holidays and   
sometimes at weekends she was allowed  
to stay up later.                      
  We asked Fiona about her favourite   
food. New potatoes,roast beef,peas,rice
pudding,jelly.                         
  Hobbies:- skipping,reading,writing   
and collecting stamps.                 
                                       
           -o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
