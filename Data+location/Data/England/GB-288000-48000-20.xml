		<title>20Sailing in Start Bay.</title>
		<content> Our boat Venn is a 21 ft Cinder and   
 has a mooring just down from the      
 Higher Ferry.It has no reg.no.because 
 we do not do any racing in it,and dad 
 says it is too expensive.We also have 
 a 10ft dinghy with a cuddy,and an     
 inflatable dinghy.One Sunday I went   
 sailing.For a time I took the helm.I  
 steered it out to sea.It was very good
 weather for sailing,we kept on heeling
 over,and we were sailing at 7-8 knots.
 We were going out to Start Bay but by 
 Slapton Sands,I chickened out because 
 we were heeling over too much,so we   
 turned back.When we were going past   
 Mill Bay Cove we spotted a Fisherman  
 17 For Hire boat with an outboard     
 motor which had broken down, and was  
 slowly drifting out to sea.So we towed
 them as far as the yacht moorings.The 
 boat-hire man came,and said the       
 sheering pin had gone.                </content>
