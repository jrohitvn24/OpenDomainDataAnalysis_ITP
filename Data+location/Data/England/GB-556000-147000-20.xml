		<title>20TRENCH FARM HILDENBOROUGH</title>
		<content>  Geoffrey Brooks inherited Trench Farm
 from his grandfather in 1960,having   
 lived there all his life.He owns 310  
 acres of grade 3 land producing winter
 wheat,barley and beans.There is also  
 grassland for silage and hay with     
 grazing for 120 sheep and 50 bullocks.
  Trench Farm existed before 1860 and  
 some of its hedges are known to be    
 very ancient.There has been a farm    
 there for over 600 years and Mr.Brooks
 believes that there was a Roman sett_ 
 lement near Hilden Brook which divides
 his land. Over the past 20 years farm_
 ing here has become more machinery in_
 tensive. The land was originally used 
 for raising hops,but this was given up
 in 1967 when the Oast became defunct. 
  These buildings are now the Oast     
 Theatre.Mr.Brooks now sees the farm_  
 er's main problems as politicians,    
 children and birds,in that order.     </content>
