		<title>20A LOCAL FOOTBALL CLUB</title>
		<content> On Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,        
 Thursday and Friday evenings I do     
 football training at my club which is 
 called Sherwin. My managers name is   
 Mr. Lally. We have to run around the  
 park and do exercises like star jumps 
 and sit ups. Then we play a game of   
 football. The Sherwin kit is purple   
 and yellow. We are in a league with 14
 other clubs. We have lost only 4 games
 this season against teams from around 
 Derby. Usually 15 people go training  
 at Sherwin. There are 6 teams in      
 Sherwin for players of different ages.
 On Sunday you have to pay 50 pence to 
 play in a league match. You have to   
 bring your medical card and two       
 photographs when you first join.
