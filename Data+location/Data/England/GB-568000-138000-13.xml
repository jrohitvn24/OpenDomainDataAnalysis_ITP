		<title>13The Old Railway, Horsmonden</title>
		<content>The railway ran from Hawkhurst to      
Paddock Wood, to connect with the main 
line from London to the coast.  It     
operated from l892 to l962.            
The station is now the old Station     
Garage owned by Mr. W. Barge &amp; Son who 
do vehicle maintenance work.  In the   
garage yard you can see the old        
platform and signal box and part of    
the old railway line covered with      
rubbish.  The old tunnel under the     
Maidstone Road is now blocked.  Part   
of the cutting at the back of the      
school has been filled in and is a     
field for grazing sheep.  There was a  
railway bridge over the Goudhurst Road 
which was too low for the buses so they
dipped the road but that was not enough
so the buses were specially made.      
Signs of the old permanent way across  
the Parish still exist but all lines &amp; 
sleepers were removed years ago.       </content>
