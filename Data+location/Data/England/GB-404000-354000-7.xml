     In Butterton, there are several   
shops - a general store, a butcher's   
shop, a post office and a small shop   
which sells sweets and drinks and acts 
as a tea-room.                         
     The general store sells tinned and
frozen food, fresh vegetables and      
fruit, drinks, papers and stationery.  
The owner also delivers orders and     
papers to nearby villages.  He stocks  
up weekly, on Mondays from the         
Potteries, and with fresh produce from 
Leek on Wednesdays and Saturdays.      
     The butcher's shop has a wide     
range of meat.  They also have a van   
which travels to local villages selling
meat.  Four people work at the shop.   
They slaughter about 5 cows and 15     
sheep every Monday.                    
     Both shops are open every day from
9a.m. until 5 or 6p.m.                 </content>
