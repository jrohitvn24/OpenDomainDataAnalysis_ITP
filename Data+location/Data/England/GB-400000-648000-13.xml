		<title>13Landscape near Scremerston.</title>
		<content>   Most of the land around Scremerston 
 is farmland.Walking along the roads   
 and pathways we often see lots of wild
 creatures;rabbits,pheasants,hedgehogs 
 and sometimes roe deer.Alongside the  
 paths and among the hedgerows are many
 wild flowers and in summer we can find
 slugs,snails,caterpillars ladybirds   
 and all kinds of insects.             
     There are many different kinds of 
 birds,sparrows,chaffinches,starlings, 
 jackdaws,crows,rooks swallows and     
 gulls.                                
     The hedges are mainly hawthorn and
 there are a number of trees about,    
 some of them forming small woods  and 
 shelterbelts and others grown to make 
 the landscape more agreeable to the   
 eye.The trees are mainly conifer but  
 there are whitebeam,sycamore ,elder   
 and elm.Many of the footpaths link    
 farms and scattered houses.           </content>
