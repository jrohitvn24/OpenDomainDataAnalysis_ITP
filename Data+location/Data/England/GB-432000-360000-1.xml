 "Derbyshire is one of the country's   
 delightful counties,not overpowering  
 with history but filled with Nature's 
 lovely places,packed with natural     
 beauty in infinite variety" so writes 
 Arthur Mee in his book "Derbyshire"   
 from The King's England series.       
 A place for everybody is Derbyshire,  
 with more than a thousand square miles
 of wonderland almost in the heart of  
 England.                              
 It is unique in its beauty, as        
 changing as a flower in spring,with a 
 freshness and tenderness which seem to
 hang about its hills and dales,and a  
 haunting loveliness which rises to    
 enchantment at its greatest heights   
 and in its deepest solitudes.
