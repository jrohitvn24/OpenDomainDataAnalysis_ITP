		<content>       I live at Brick Leys Too which  
 is in our survey area. My Mum has to  
 take me and my brother out of our area
 to school. I go to Roxwell Primary    
 School and my brother Hylands School  
 in Writtle. Our house is 400 years old
 and it used to be a Barn/Cow Shed. The
 3rd house was the granary. We have a  
 balcony at the back of our house where
 we wanted to build a 3rd bedroom but  
 we were not allowed. So now we are    
 having a bedroom in the dining room.  
 We have a big kitchen that we are     
 altering; the bottom end will be the  
 dining room and the top end will be   
 the kitchen. Before we started we had 
 a wall up the top end of the pantry we
 have had that wall knocked down. It   
 has made a lot of difference. My Mum  
 works in Gt. Baddow and my Dad works  
 in Chelmsford.
