		<title>17LONGFORD RIDING CLUB</title>
		<content>    I am a member of the Longford and  
 District Riding Club.                 
    To start the season they had a ten 
 mile ride and an instruction rally.   
 Later on in the season they have lots 
 of one day events. Around October they
 have cross countries.                 
    On the ten mile ride I went with my
 sister and friends that are in the    
 club. We went on the road to the      
 Weaver Hills and then back by the road
 to the farm we started at.            
    At shows there are about eight show
 jumping classes and lots of gymkhana  
 games and sometimes five working      
 hunter classes.                       
    In cross countries they have about 
 20 fences on the course. Usually it is
 one and a half miles and you have to  
 walk the course the day before.
