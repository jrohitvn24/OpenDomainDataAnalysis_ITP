		<content> We meet once a week,ages range from   
 5-18.Winter meetings are in the       
 Village Hall.We play games for        
 everybody to join in,like British     
 Bulldogs,relay races &amp; tiggy.In summer
 we play rounders or cricket on the    
 village green.Once a month we hire an 
 inflatable which costs 10p extra per  
 child.In May we have our annual camp, 
 usually in the Lake District.October  
 sees 3 or 4 months' work all put      
 together for the night of our play.   
 The children are the actors &amp; help    
 both backstage &amp; in the house.It is a 
 very popular event.                   
 Over the last 2 years,&amp; with the help 
 of village people,we have saved a sum 
 of Â£400.If we can keep up as success- 
 fully,we hope to buy a pool table &amp; a 
 disco unit.The Youth Club is well     
 attended &amp; the children enjoy their   
 regular meeting.                      </content>
