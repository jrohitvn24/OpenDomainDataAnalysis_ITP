		<title>20    Riding in our area.</title>
		<content>   Around our area there are a few     
 stables. The instuctors take the      
 children out and they ride along      
 bridleways,fields and roads.          
 Bridleways are tracks that horses and 
 ponies are allowed to use. Some bridle
 ways go through fields and they go on 
 for miles.                            
   The stables will have 15-30 horses  
 with all different colours and        
 sizes.Many schools have children who  
 help on Saturdays.                    
   Around our area you can ride for    
 miles and many young children have    
 their own ponies to ride.             
   Most riding schools charge between  
 Â£2.50 and Â£5.00 for a lesson.Some have
 little shows,where the children can   
 ride the ponies of their choice and   
 have a chance to win a rossette.
