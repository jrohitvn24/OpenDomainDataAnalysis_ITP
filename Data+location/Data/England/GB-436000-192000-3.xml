		<content>In this area there are 13 farms, which 
vary in size from just over 100 acres  
to the largest one covering over 600   
acres. The average size, however, is   
about 200 acres.  There is an almost   
equal division between arable land and 
grassland.  Winter wheat and winter    
barley are the major crops grown.      
The only other crops are maize (about  
100 acres), and oats (about 50 acres). 
There are about 5 separate areas of    
deciduous woodland, varying from about 
half an acre to ten acres in size.  The
total area of woodland would be just   
under 20 acres. One small area is used 
by the Old Berks Hunt. Most of the     
grassland is permanent grass and       
grazing land.
