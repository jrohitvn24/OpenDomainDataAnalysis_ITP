		<title>19EAST LAYTON - Social Club</title>
		<content>  In spite of its very small population
 the  village  now   has  a  small  but
 thriving Social Club.  It is housed in
 a wooden building on the roadside near
 the church. The portable structure was
 bought  and  erected by members of the
 village    Quoits Club    who   having
 joined the local  Zetland League found
 themselves  with  nowhere  to  provide
 refreshment  for  the  visiting teams.
 All   these   other   teams  use   the
 facilities at their respective  public
 houses for this purpose.              
  The Club  thus now acts as a  Village
 Hall and is used for darts, dominoes, 
 whist drives  and   Country &amp; Western 
 concerts. It is thus the social hub of
 village life.                         
  The  two   quoits  teams   have  been
 amongst the  most successful teams  in
 the area, having been league champions
 many times&amp;with top individual players</content>
