		<title>09      Country living.</title>
		<content> Not many years ago it was the poor who
 lived in the small{villages}in tiny   
{cottages}clustered around the green,  
 the{church}and the big house.   Since 
 the early nineteen-sixties and the    
 growth of individual prosperity, it is
 the better-off who can afford the     
 luxury of living in the country,      
 dependent on the{car}to travel to work
 and with the money to alter and extend
 the{cottages}and provide them with the
 many conveniences of modern life.     
 There is less distinction between poor
 and wealthy and{villages}such as those
 in the block surveyed now contain few 
 of the original inhabitants.   Where  
 generations grew up, married, lived   
 and died in the same{village,}there is
 now much greater movement around the  
 country and from house to house.   The
 local{councils}provide some housing   
 for those who cannot afford to buy.   </content>
