		<title>14ELM COTTAGE, STOKE FLEMING</title>
		<content>   {Elm Cottage}is right in the middle 
 of the village of{Stoke Fleming.      
   We cannot use our front door because
 it goes straight onto the main road.  
 In fact the cottage sticks out into   
 the road. In the summer it is a       
 constant traffic jam of{holidaymaker's
 cars and very dangerous. We have to   
 use the back door all the time.       
   When the cottage was built{300 years
 ago the main street was a muddy track 
 and the only traffic was{horses and   
{carts.}The cottage had a{thatched roof
 until about 25 years ago when it was  
 changed to slates which will last     
 longer. We have two bedrooms,two      
 living rooms,a kitchen,a bathroom, a  
 laundry room and a small yard at the  
 back. Before we bought it they wanted 
 to{knock the cottage down}to make the 
 road wider which would be a shame.
