		<content> Mr. James Hadley keeps a pig farm.He  
 has some arable land too.             
                          Mr. Hadley's 
 farm is 25 acres. He does not need as 
 much land as an arable or beef farmer,
 because his piggery is in large sheds.
 It is intensive farming.              
                         Mr. Hadley has
 seen many changes in his farming life.
 Intensive animal units, bigger fields 
 (to accommodate large farm machinery),
 hedgerows have disappeared and        
 government controls have been         
 introduced.                           
            Mr. Hadley sells his pigs  
 by a contract system. If he sold them 
 at the market he would be unsure of   
 the price they would fetch. This way  
 he is sure of some profit.            
                           His pigs are
 sold to a pork distributer.
