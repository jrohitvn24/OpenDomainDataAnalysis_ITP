		<title>14WHY HOOK NEEDS A YOUTH CLUB</title>
		<content> There has been a lot of talk lately   
 about teenagers who meet in the centre
 of the village.The truth is there's   
 nowhere else for us to go and be with 
 our friends in Hook.We know we make a 
 lot of noise,sometimes block the path 
 and- 'make the the place look untidy'.
 Recently we've got the blame for some 
 broken seats,vandalism at Elizabeth   
 Hall and even for litter near the     
 station.Sometimes car loads come from 
 Fleet and bikers from all over just to
 make aggro-perhaps they do the damage.
 Since our photos were in the local    
 paper lots of blokes have come to talk
 to us.One man said he would help us   
 collect money to build a wooden club  
 house if a plot could be found but we 
 don't think there's much chance.Hook's
 getting bigger every day so there will
 be lots more teenagers,Bob and I hope 
 something will be done soon.          </content>
