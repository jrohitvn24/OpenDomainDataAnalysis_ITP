		<content> The area coverd by our grid squares   
 contains parts of three villages      
 _Ickford,Worminghall and              
 Shabbington.All these villages are    
 fairly small (Ickford is the largest  
 and has a population of 500) The      
 houses are a mixture of old and fairly
 new.Many of the old houses are        
 thatched.The villages are fairly quiet
 and pleasant to live in.Around the    
 villages most of the land is fairly   
 flat farmland _ some used for cattle  
 and some for crops, particularly      
 wheat.                                
 There are no factories or large shops 
 in our area and most people have to go
 outside the villages to places like   
 Oxford and Aylesbury for work or      
 shopping.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
