		<title>08WORKING IN A PUB.</title>
		<content> The Cherry Tree has 3 main trade      
 rooms, the public bar and 2 lounge    
 bars.There is a veranda, 1 main cellar
 and 3 storage rooms for fuel,wine and 
 spirits.They usually start at half    
 nine in the morning cleaning the place
 and getting it prepared for opening.  
 That usually continues to when they   
 open for lunchtime trading. They then 
 have to be on duty until half past two
 when the house closes after the lunch 
 time session.After clearing up, they  
 finish about 3 o'clock and they then  
 have the afternoon fairly free        
 although often they have to go to     
 Market Harborough to get bread and    
 various different bits and pieces for 
 use in the pub.At the present time    
 they open at 7 in the evening and go  
  through until eleven when they close.
 They have got all the rest of the     
  clearing up which is done all week.  </content>
