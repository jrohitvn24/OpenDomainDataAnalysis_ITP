		<title>06BARNSLEY CHURCH CONTINUED</title>
		<content>   Tourists visit the church and the   
 visitors' book goes back to 1941.It   
 begins with 'Robert of Austria', but  
 we do not know who he was. There have 
 been 110 visitors already this year,  
 in the first six months. The furthest 
 ones come from Canada and the U.S.A.  
 There may be more American visitors   
 because of the U.S.A.F. base at       
 Fairford. One lady came from Sydney,  
 Australia, and wrote that she was the 
 great grand-daughter of Rev. George   
 Vidal, Rector of Barnsley in the first
 quarter of this century.              
    Mr. Michael Ward is the vicar of   
 Barnsley, Winson and Bibury churches. 
 Apart from running the churches, he   
 also talks to people and helps people 
 with their problems, and he has just  
 made the church in Winson a retired   
 nuns' home, but he generally runs and 
 looks after the churches.             </content>
