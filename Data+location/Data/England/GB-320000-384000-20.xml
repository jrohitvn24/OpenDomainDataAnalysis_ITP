		<title>20SCHOOLS IN THE AREA.</title>
		<content>   There are four schools in the area, 
 all of them in or about West Kirby.   
   Two of these schools Dormie House   
 School, and Avalon School are private 
 schools whilst the other two          
 St.Bridgets Church of England Primary 
 School and Calday Grange Grammar      
 School are in the state system.       
   Calday Grammar School for boys is   
 a large Grammar school of about 900   
 pupils and is one of the very         
 oldest schools in the region. It      
 may be of interest that at the time of
 writing our area is still using the   
 11+ test for the selection of         
 childrens secondary education.        
   The pupils of St.Bridgets Primary   
 School and the pupils of Calday Grange
 Grammar School have been responsible  
 for the compilation of the information
 used in these entries.
