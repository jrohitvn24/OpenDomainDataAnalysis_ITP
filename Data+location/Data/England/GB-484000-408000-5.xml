		<content> At the back of school there are lots  
 of courts.                            
 They have little parks with a climbing
 frame and a swing.                    
 There is a fence and some poplar trees
 that separate the school from them.   
 There is a gate which people can get  
 through when they come to school.     
 The courts are a new development.     
 Most of the dwellings are flats, some 
 are bungalows, others are terraced    
 houses. (They have 'cupboards' outside
 for the bins.)                        
 There are now many courts on the      
 estate.                               
 Each has a small road with courts     
 leading off.                          
 Usually you have six to eight courts  
 to a road.                            
 There is plenty of space for cars to  
 park.
