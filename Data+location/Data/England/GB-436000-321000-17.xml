		<content> The sign of the{Saracen's Head}once   
 depicted a turbanned Arab, but now it 
 is plain &amp; reads 'FREE HOUSE'.The     
 property has recently been bought by  
 the owners,who have been there for 3  
 generations. Children are grown up, &amp; 
 the sons work in Derby.All have no    
 wish to move.                         
 The solid brick built house has 10    
 rooms &amp; a cellar,which occasionally   
 floods. The  outbuildings, cowshed &amp;  
 stable date back to when it was a     
 smallholding. There is a small private
 garden at the back &amp; about 3/4acre in 
 front dotted with picnic tables. Trade
 is seasonal. Beers, wine &amp; spirits are
 supplied by 3 breweries: 2 from Burton
 &amp; 1 from Leicester. Their competition 
 ensures prices are reasonable.        
 A pleasant friendly place, updated but
 stll retaining its country atmosphere.
