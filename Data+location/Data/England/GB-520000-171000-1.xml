		<title>01The Roehampton Area</title>
		<content>Our Area is administered by 4 Local    
Authorities: London Boroughs of Merton,
Wandsworth, Richmond and Kingston      
Surrey. Over half the Area is parkland 
or common. Wimbledon Common, a wooded  
heathland carefully conserved for urban
recreational purposes, contains a wind-
mill, ponds, golf courses and sports   
pitches. Richmond Park is a Royal Park,
mainly grassland with scattered trees, 
a few wooded plantations, ponds, sports
pitches and some houses, notably White 
Lodge home of the Royal Ballet School. 
The areas of desirable,expensive,      
detached houses contrast sharply with  
the Council Estates in the area. There 
are not many shops locally. Some large 
Georgian houses are now colleges.      
Noisy traffic bisects the area on the  
A3 road and increasingly on the A306.  
This latter road is ruining Roehampton 
Village and divides the community.     </content>
