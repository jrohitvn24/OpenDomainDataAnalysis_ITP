		<content>    The{"Breakdancing"}fashion has well
 and truly hit this area, so there is  
 no question of the rural areas of the 
 country missing out on the latest     
 trends. Television ensures that the   
 more remote parts of the country are  
 kept right up to date with what is    
 going on in the world.                
                                       
   Children dress in grey or green     
 canvas trousers which are elasticated 
 at the bottoms and have a multitude of
 unnecessary zips and patch pockets all
 over them. They wear colourful        
 sweaters and many are able to do      
{"robotics"}as well as more active     
 forms of dancing with incredible      
 skill. Whereas a few months ago boys  
 would have been ridiculed for dancing,
 today they win the respect of their   
 peers if they are "ace breakers".
