		<content> In Thurlby and Northorpe we have all  
 kinds of Housing.  Most of the new    
 houses were built after 1960.  The new
 houses are on two estates built in    
 Northorpe.   One estate has detached  
 houses and bungalows.The other        
 estate has detached houses. All of the
 bungalows and houses have garages,    
 some have two. There are five thatched
 stone cottages and a few stone farm   
 houses. All the rest are made of      
 bricks with tile or slate roofs. One  
 of the oldest cottages in Thurlby     
 dates back to 1590. It is owned by our
 school caretaker. Fifty children were 
 asked what kind of places they lived  
 in. 24 in detached houses, 12 in      
 bungalows, 6 in semi detached, 2 in   
 cottages and 1 in a farm house.A lot  
 of people like to live in Thurlby or  
 Northorpe but travel to work each day 
 by car.                               </content>
