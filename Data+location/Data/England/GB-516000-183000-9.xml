   There are two markets in our area,  
 both are called 'Wembley Market'.     
                                       
   The first market is near {Wembley   
{Stadium.}It is very big and only opens
 on Sundays. It is in the open air in  
 the stadium car park. They sell all   
 kinds of things there like toys,      
 sweets,clothes and snacks and many    
 people go there.                      
                                       
   The other market is near Wembley    
 High Road. It is a small covered      
 market open every day. They sell      
 mostly fruit, vegetables,sweets and   
 clothes.They have just modernized it  
 recently but few people go there at   
 the moment.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
