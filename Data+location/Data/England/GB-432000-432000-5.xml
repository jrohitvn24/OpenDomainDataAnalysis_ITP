		<content>    Other buildings are open and show  
 what life on the farm used to be like.
   The Laundry room has a copper, a    
 posser, a scrubbing board, a mangle   
 and a flat iron.   There is also a    
 Stone Mason's shop, a Joiners shop and
 a Saw Mill.   Leaflets and Checklists 
 are ther for the children to test     
 their skill in recognising the famr   
 tools such as a seed broadcaster, a   
 turnip drill, a stook mover and a flat
 harrow!   The old methods and machines
 are used on the farm as far as        
 possible, but olden times or now the  
 animals still need 'mucking out'.     
    After tracking down the implements,
 recognising the British White Cattle, 
 the Anglo-Nubian goat, the Jacob      
 sheep, Noah and Nellie the donkeys,   
 walking through the gardens and round 
 the lake, school parties or families  
 can make for the picnic areas.        </content>
