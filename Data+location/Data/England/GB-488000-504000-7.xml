		<title>07Hill and Farm Cattle.</title>
		<content> The cattle on most farms are beef     
 cattle with a few milkers on certain  
 farms.                                
 The most popular milking cow is the   
 black and white Friesan cow which     
 gives a good supply of milk.  These   
 are docile animals, and are found on  
 the better land in enclosed good      
 pasture.                              
 On poorer and higher pastures and     
 selected areas of enclosed moorland   
 there may be herds of suckler cows.   
 Suckler herds usually consist of black
 cows continually running with a beef  
 bred bull, either the white faced red 
 Hereford, the dark cream Charollais or
 the black or red Limousin.            
 Such cattle are semi-wild and care    
 should be taken to avoid going into   
 fields where they are grazing.
