 DAIRY,BEEF AND SHEEP.CROPS FOR HAY AND
 SILAGE ARE GROWN FOR FODDER DURING    
 LONG AND OFTEN SEVERE WINTERS.MOST OF 
 THE LAND IS FIT ONLY FOR GRAZING,DUE  
 TO ROCKY OUTCROPS AND SMALL           
 TARNS.FRESIAN COWS ARE MOST POPULAR,  
 AS THEY GIVE A GOOD MILK YIELD,AND    
 'MASHAMS',A CROSS BREED,STURDY SHEEP, 
 USUALLY BEARING TWO LAMBS PER YEAR.THE
 MILK YIELD IS TAKEN BY TANKER INTO THE
 KENDAL MILK MARKETING BOARD'S CREAMERY
 FOR PROCESSING INTO BUTTER,DRIED MILK 
 AND BABY FOOD.THERE IS A MUSHROOM FARM
 WHICH SUPPLIES CULTIVATED MUSHROOMS TO
 THE TRADE,AND ONE SMALLHOLDING SELLS  
 VEGETABLES AT THE LOCAL MARKET,HELD   
 TWICE A WEEK IN KENDAL.TWO SMALL FIRMS
 HIRE OUT AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY ON A  
 DAILY BASIS,THE FARMS BEING TOO SMALL 
 TO AFFORD THEIR OWN EQUIPMENT.
