 The stretch of{the Test}in our survey 
 flows almost entirely through private 
 land.The fishing rights are hired out.
 The landowner employs a{"water keeper"
 to manage the river{.Dredging}is      
 carried out during the winter and     
{river weed is cut}in summer to keep   
 the water flowing and prevent         
 flooding .Non-mud collecting weed e.g.
 water crowfoot is not cut.Between{Nov}
{and March electric fishing}stun pike  
 and other trout predators is carried  
 out.The pike are removed to man-made  
 lakes for angling.{The river is       
{stocked with 1000 times 2-3lb trout   
{usually twice a year.}This costs      
 between Â£2500 and Â£3000.These fish are
 heavier than normal river-bred trout  
 of the same age.
