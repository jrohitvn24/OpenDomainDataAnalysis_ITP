{  }The covert consists of 68 acres of 
 steep west facing scarp. It was       
 originally scrub and grassland but was
 planted by Lord Roundway as a         
 beechwood. The wood grew to maturity  
 and was felled in 1949. It was        
 replanted, but the operation failed   
 due to the dry exposed chalk          
   In 1956 the land was leased to the  
 Forestry Commision and the wood was   
 re-established. Within the covert     
 there is a nature trail constructed by
 Devizes School and the Wiltshire      
 Wildlife Conservation Corp.
