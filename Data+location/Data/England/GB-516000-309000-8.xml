		<title>08DEEPING ST.JAMES NURSERY</title>
		<content>     The French Marigold and the salvia
 suffered the most from this years cold
 weather.The nursery doesn't have many 
 problems with insects but,if there are
 the owner keeps his own stock of chem-
 icals which would take care of that.If
 necessary the owner can steam clean   
 the greenhouse or get a company to use
 gas to sterilize the soil.            
     The owner sells his flowers etc.at
 markets.He sometimes sells them at    
 shows and he also supplies a large    
 garden centre.Regular customers come  
 in to buy flowers.He makes hanging    
 baskets,patio tubs and bouquets for   
 special occasions.
