		<title>20WETHERBY TRAINING CENTRE</title>
		<content>  At the{Training Centre}we saw the    
 manager, Mr. Darrell. Then we went    
 into the dining room and saw the      
 musicians. They were all physically or
 mentally handicapped. Some suffered   
 from Down's Syndrome, their eyes were 
 more to the side than ours. There was 
 a work room and at each desk a        
 teacher. We saw a teacher with        
 five Down's sufferers who were all    
 very friendly. The teachers try to be 
 like mums and dads. There was a very  
 thin short man called a Dutch Dwarf (a
 very happy man), he went up to a      
 lady and tickled her. In the kitchen  
 some people were making a cheese and  
 onion pie. They like baking very much.
 The Training Centre is open for people
 between the ages of 16 and 65, who are
 physically or mentally handicapped, it
 aims to help them cope with daily     
 life.                                 </content>
