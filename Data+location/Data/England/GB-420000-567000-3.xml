		<title>03THE METRO IN N.W.NEWCASTLE.</title>
		<content>  The Metro is a type of rail transport
 running on electricity.The Metro in   
 the Kenton/Fawdon area of the city is 
 served by 4{unmanned stations.}It is  
 hoped that eventually the system will 
 be extended to terminate at Newcastle 
 Airport. The Metro is very{popular    
 with the public who use it to travel  
 to many areas of Tyne and Wear. The   
 trains run at ten minute intervals    
 and they{link up with the local bus   
{services.}You are not allowed to smoke
 on the Metro, a ruling of which most  
 people approve. There are two         
 controversial{level crossings without 
{barriers}where accidents have occurred
 because motorists have tried to beat  
 the red lights.The trains can't cross 
 their red lights as a device is fitted
 to the lines which acts as a brake on 
 them.{Video cameras}are to be fitted  
 to combat vandalism.                  </content>
