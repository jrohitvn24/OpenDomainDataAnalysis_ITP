 Mr.Harold Barlow owns quite a         
 large field behind his butchers shop  
 in which there are lambs and          
 sheep.Every year in February/March    
 the sheep begin to lamb.They are kept 
 in a warm brick outhouse which is     
 quite small.The Barlows  are sometimes
 up at all hours of the night helping  
 the sheep and lambs.Most people think 
 that lambs are white.True,some breeds 
 are, but this breed has a black face  
 and legs and a greyish-white fleece.  
 The male lambs are killed for meat in 
 Mr. Barlow's own abbatoir ,but the    
 females are left to lamb another year.
