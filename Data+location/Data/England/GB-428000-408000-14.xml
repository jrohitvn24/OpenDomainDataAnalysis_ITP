		<title>14Law and Order</title>
		<content> 1985 has been a difficult year for law
 and order in our area because of the  
 miners strike.There is still ill      
 feeling between the mining community  
 and the{police}force.Our area has been
 affected by numerous mining rallies   
 and an increase in{vandalism}.The area
 that we have been studying has a      
 community policeman called P.C.       
 Knowles. He goes into schools and also
 takes care of young offenders.The most
 common{crimes}in our area are house   
 burglaries,shop lifting and handbag   
 snatching.The ages for these crimes   
 varies between young children and old 
 people.The least common crime in our  
 area is manslaughter.In 1984 40% of   
 crimes in the Barnsley area were      
 solved .Any person suspected of       
 committing a crime in the area has to 
 go to Barnsley magistrates{court}for  
 sentencing.                           </content>
