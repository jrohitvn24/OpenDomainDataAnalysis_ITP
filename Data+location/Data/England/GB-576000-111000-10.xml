		<content> In 1948 they began to build a{council 
{estate,}near the old village of       
 Hollington.It is quite a big estate,  
 and our school is on the edge of      
 it.Some houses are terraced,some are  
 semi-detached. Coventry Rd. Bristol   
 Rd.and Oxford Rd.were named after     
 cities bombed in the second World War.
 Other roads were named after important
 people. There are five{shops}in       
 Blackman Avenue for local people to   
 use; there are several{play areas}for 
 the children.Some people have bought  
 their house,and have made it look     
 very smart.Half the children in our   
 school live on the estate.            
 Gary lives in one of the 4 blocks of  
{flats}called Bevin Court which was    
 built about 1965.It has 14 floors,6   
 flats on each floor.There are two     
 lifts.There is a security system      
 and everyone has a special key.       </content>
