{Phillip Martin writes:}My Mum is the  
 leader of a Beaver Colony at Godshill 
 for local boys 6-8 years. This is the 
 start of Scouting. Later we become    
 Cubs and then Scouts at 11. Girls can 
 belong to the Brownie Pack and to the 
 Guides at Chillerton. After that both 
 boys and girls can become Venture     
 Scouts.                               </content>
