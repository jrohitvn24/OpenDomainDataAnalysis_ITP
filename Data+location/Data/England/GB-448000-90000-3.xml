		<content> Northwood Parish Church or The Church 
 of St. John The Baptist is just off   
 Cowes Road.The vicar is Richard Parker
 and he gives interesting sermons.     
 People have been worshipping here     
 since the 12th. century when the      
 church was built.When you enter the   
 church you pass through the original  
 norman arch. There is also an old font
 and the pulpit is over three hundred  
 years old.Today an average of eighty  
 people worship in the church each     
 Sunday. There are often special       
 services for children and their       
 parents. There is a family service    
 every month and Morning Prayer or Holy
 communion on Sundays.On Mothering     
 Sunday all the mothers get a posy of  
 flowers.At Christmas the children of  
 Northwood School sing carols in       
 church.
