   The 'Late Kings Arms'was the first  
 pub,built several hundred years       
 ago.Soon after, it was converted into 
 a house.A new pub'The Stoke Canon     
 Inn'was built opposite.Before being   
 built the land used to be a coal yard.
 Mr.Dewley was the first land lord,then
 he passed the position down to his    
 son,but a new land lord soon had to be
 found because Mr.Dewleys son drowned  
 himself.Mr.Wright was next, then      
 Mr.Wall came along.He is still there  
 now in 1985.They have converted the   
 pub quite a lot from a small bar to a 
 large bar and what used to be the     
 cellar,is now the lounge.Since Mr.Wall
 has been there they have had quite a  
 few famous people visting .Terry Wogan
 is one of them.Also they have had a   
 few television announcers.            </content>
