		<title>07ALDWICK BAY ESTATE</title>
		<content> The Bay Estate is a very high class   
 area on the coast of Bognor.  It is a 
 private and{very expensive estate.    
 Some of the houses have thatched      
 roofs, some even have thatched roofs  
 to their garages.   The estate has its
 own private estate agent to deal with 
 the buying and selling of houses.     
 There are lots of houses with french  
 windows leading on to balconies. Some 
 of the houses are timbered and some   
 have leaded windows.                  
                                       
 There are some children in our school 
 who live on the estate.  One of my    
 friends has six bedrooms and a massive
 garden like most of the other houses. 
 Another friend said that half of his  
 house is a converted barn.            
                                       
 They have their own private beach and 
 the roads are also private.           </content>
