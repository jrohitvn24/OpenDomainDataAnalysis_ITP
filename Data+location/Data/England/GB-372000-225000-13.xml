		<content>  The soil determines the type of      
 farming in an area and the heavy loam 
 soils to the east support a range of  
 mixed farming while the lighter, sandy
 soil to the north are mainly arable.  
  The weather for most of 1985 was much
 wetter than average and the hay crop  
 was delayed and quality was only      
 average. Many of the farms in the area
 now make silage as well as hay. This  
 has the benefit of good feed-value and
 the cutting of the grass is not so    
 dependent on long periods of dry      
 weather. The corn harvest was badly   
 affected by the wet, cool summer and  
 was late. Most farms are highly       
 mechanised and agricultural machines  
 and tractors are a common sight. Most 
 livestock is taken to the Monday      
 Market in Gloucester, the main animals
 are beef cattle, dairy cows and some  
 sheep- prices have been good.         </content>
