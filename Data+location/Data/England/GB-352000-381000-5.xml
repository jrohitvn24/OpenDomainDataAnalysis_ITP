		<title>05FARMING IN  RUNCORN</title>
		<content> Until the mid 1950's Runcorn's        
 industry consisted of chemicals,      
 leather and farming.Only the chemical 
 industry survived and flourished.     
 Farming today is on a continually     
 reduced scale,due to land being built 
 on for housing,transport and industry.
 Much of the farm land was lost to the 
 new town development in the 1960's.   
 Several farms have been demolished but
 those remaining are typical of 19th.  
 century Cheshire farming _ dairy,     
 arable and poultry farming. Such      
 farms, though few in number and small 
 in size are to be found on the        
 outskirts of Runcorn. There are small 
 herds of dairy cattle;hens reared for 
 eggs; wheat,barley,oats and potatoes, 
 are the main crops.But some of the    
 land is grassed to provide silage/hay.
