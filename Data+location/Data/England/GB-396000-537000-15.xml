		<title>15Origins Of Families</title>
		<content>      We have carried out a survey     
 amongst the parents of the pupils at  
 Stanhope Barrington School.In this    
 survey we hoped to find out           
 information that would  tell us where 
 these families live and have lived.   
  Question:How long have you lived in  
 Stanhope?                             
  Just over a half of the people said  
 that they have lived in Stanhope for  
 over twenty years,over one third have 
 lived here for 10-20 years,and only   
 one fifth for less than five years.   
  Question:Where did you attend Primary
 school?                               
  Over one third of our children's     
 parents went to Primary school in     
 Stanhope.Another third went to        
 Primary school elsewhere in Weardale  
 or Co.Durham.                         
      Many of our families have lived  
 here for a long time.                 </content>
