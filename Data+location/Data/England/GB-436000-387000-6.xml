		<title>06A NIGHT AT T'CLUB:Sheffield</title>
		<content>   The Don Valley, on the east of      
 Sheffield is part of{'Clubland'.}Here 
 in the clubs for working men you can  
 have a drink with your neighbours and 
 enjoy an evenings entertainment on    
 stage. Many well known stars have     
 begun a career in these clubs before  
 moving on to theatre and t.v. fame.   
  {Bingo}is a popular part of a night  
 out at the club _ prizes are offered  
 for the winner of a game where numbers
 1-99 are picked at ramdom from a      
 container. The players cover numbers  
 on their cards - all of which are     
 different. The winner is the one to   
 cover all their numbers first.        
   Children love to ride their extra   
 tough{'B.M.X.'}bikes round the local  
 streets or the special tracks provided
 by the{City  Council.
