		<title>13SCHOOL FETE DAY</title>
		<content> Iwoke at 7o'clock.I read and played   
 games until breakfast.I made a plate  
 garden for the competition.I used moss
 and stones and small flowers to make a
 miniature garden.Gabriel made a funny 
 animal out of vegetables for the      
 Vegetable Figure competition.We had   
 lunch and  daddy took mummy to school 
 so that she could set up her stall.   
 We went to the fete at 2:30.There     
 was a team of morris dancers,The      
 Faithful City Morris Men.After they   
 had danced there was the Grand Parade 
 when the Fancy Dress was judged.      
 Gabriel was a combine harvester and   
 daddy was a tinker. He won a prize.   
 The theme was a Country Fair. The     
  challenge,when other schools send    
 a team for a competition,was to race a
 lady dressed up as a scarescrow,in a  
 wheelbarrow.We went home at 6o'clock.I
 went to bed at 8:40pm.                </content>
