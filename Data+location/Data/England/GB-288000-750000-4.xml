		<content> An interview with Mr.and Mrs Campbell.
{1) Do you fish yourself and what is   
{the largest fish you have caught?     
 I fish nowadays for salmon,salmon     
 trout and brown trout.The largest     
 fresh water fish I have caught has    
 been a 32lb.salmon taken from the     
 Aberfeldy beat.This is a record from  
 that particular beat,beating the      
 previous best fish that was 27lbs.    
{2> Where do the fishermen come from?  
 The fishermen are mainly visitors to  
 the area.These people have either     
 fished this area before or are people 
 who have heard of the famous Tay      
 Salmon.Very few local people fish my  
 beats because of the cost.            
{3> What are the duties of a Ghillie?} 
 He is a person who knows every rock or
 resting place of fish on a particular 
 beat.He looks after and cleans his    
 appointed area. &lt;continued> {         </content>
