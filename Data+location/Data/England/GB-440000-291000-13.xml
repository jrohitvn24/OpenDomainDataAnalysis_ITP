		<content>{ BOY'S BRIGADE}                       
 Every Tuesday we meet at Hinckley     
 Baptist Church at 6.15.Our uniform is 
 blue jumper,black trousers and black  
 shoes.On the jumper we have a badge   
 with an anchor ,a red cross and our   
 motto 'Sure and Steadfast'.           
   We play games like beanbag Hockey or
 Football.We also work for badges we   
 need to do eight things for each      
 badge. We also haves badges to show   
 how long we have been in Boy's        
 Brigade.                              
  You can join Boy's Brigade at        
 six years and be in the Anchor Boys,  
 at eight you join the junior section  
 then at eleven you join the company   
 until you are sixteen,when you may    
 become an officer.                    
  We sometimes go away for weekends, we
 have a band ,we go on parade once a   
 month. I like Boy's Brigade.          </content>
