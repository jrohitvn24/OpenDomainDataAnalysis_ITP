		<content> Until recently very few local people  
 could afford the time or the money to 
 go away on holiday. One farmer told us
 that he had never had a holiday until 
 1980; now he goes abroad once a year. 
 Most families take a holiday away each
 year. A few go away for days to visit 
 a place of interest or to the sea-side
 at Morecambe, Scarborough or Redcar.  
 As well as village fetes and functions
 in the Village Halls, there are clubs 
 and societies available to almost all 
 age groups. There are evening classes 
 during the winter months. To attend   
 the various clubs and classes, people 
 often have to travel to other         
 villages, and sharing cars is         
 normal. The public houses are local   
 gathering places, especially for young
 adults. Young farmers groups are very 
 well-supported and traditional games  
 such as quoits are popular in villages</content>
