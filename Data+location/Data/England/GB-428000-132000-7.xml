		<content>   The parish church of{St Mary}was    
 built in the Middle Ages, but it was  
 badly damaged in the{Great Fire}of    
 Broughton in 1638, signs of this can  
 still be seen on the stone work. The  
 fire destroyed the centre of the      
 village, which is why there are not   
 many thatched cottages in Broughton.  
   The{Dovecote}standing in the grounds
 of{St Mary's Church,}dates from 1340, 
 but was rebuilt in 1684 with 482      
 nesting boxes in the thickness of the 
 walls. The Broughton dovecote has a   
 newly rebuilt{potence}or revolving    
 ladder.                               
   The{Baptist Church}was founded in   
 1655; it was one of the earliest      
 in the country.                       
   There are many other interesting and
 attractive buildings of many periods  
 and styles along the{High Street}and  
 its narrow side streets.              </content>
