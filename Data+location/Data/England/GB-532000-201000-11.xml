		<title>11Travel in Cheshunt</title>
		<content>     Public transport in Cheshunt is   
 quite good.Train services to London   
 run approx. every 15 minutes in the   
 rush hour.Double decker buses run     
 frequently along the main shopping    
 centre.This is separated from the     
 rural area by the busy A10 between    
 London and the north.Since 1982       
 Tesco's free bus service collects     
 customers from various towns and      
 villages.                             
     A rush hour census on the A10     
 counted 415 vehicles in 15 minutes!The
 traffic thundered past in waves.Cars  
 and pedestrians find it very difficult
 to cross the A10 at these times.A     
  survey in our junior school showed   
 that the majority of parents travel to
 work by car.People walk or cycle along
 the quiet country lanes yet within    
 minutes you can join one of the       
 country's main arterial roads.        </content>
