		<content>  Inhabitants enjoy living in the      
 villages although they work           
 elsewhere. More community spirit and  
 meeting places would be welcomed but  
 most people are too busy to put energy
 into such projects. In Woodeaton the  
 need for control of traffic i.e. in   
 terms of numbers and weights of       
 vehicles and their speed is           
 recognised. A speed limit of 30 m.p.h.
 together with street lighting is felt 
 necessary.                            
  The farming community don't like the 
 Common Agricultural Policy dictated by
 the European Economic Community.Arable
 farming is more profitable than       
 keeping livestock.                    
  Most houses have a telephone and     
 there is a public phone box in        
 Elsfield but not in Woodeaton.All     
 three villages have a post box.Mail is
 collected and delivered every weekday.</content>
