		<content>   Mrs.Pyle's father and grandfather   
 both had tailors in Whickham and her  
 aunt used to be the only baker in the 
 village. She had 4 brothers and 3     
 sisters. One of her brothers was      
 killed during the First War. He was   
 killed on the day before he was due to
 come home on leave. One of his friends
 was afraid to do guard duty so her    
 brother took his place. He was shot by
 a German sniper. Mrs.Pyle was very sad
 about this.                           
   When she was a little girl the      
 street lights were gas not electric.  
 She told us about a man called old    
 Michael, whose job it was to light the
 lamps each evening. He had only one   
 arm so he was given the job as        
 lamplighter. We enjoyed talking to    
 Mrs.Pyle and wished we could have     
 stayed at her house for a longer time.
