		<title>01Longstone Edge to Calver.</title>
		<content> This is an area of hills and valleys  
 lying between three villages in the   
 Peak District National Park -Great    
 Longstone, Calver and Stoney          
 Middleton.                            
 It is limestone country, with rough   
 stone walls, isolated farms and mining
 -both current and worked out -as its  
 principal features.                   
 The land rises from 140 metres at its 
 lowest point to 391 metres at the     
 trigonometrical point on Longstone    
 Moor. Metalled roads border the south,
 east and north sides and most commerce
 and habitations are located on them,  
 although only two hamlets -Hassop and 
 Rowland -are actually contained within
 the block. The farming land is almost 
 entirely rough grazing, used for      
 rearing cattle and sheep.
