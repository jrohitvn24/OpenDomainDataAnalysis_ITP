		<content> The Jumbles Country Park was opened in
 1971 by the N.W.Water Authority.It    
 covers 77 acres of land,55 acres of   
 which are water.                      
 The reservoir is southernmost in the  
 Bradshaw Brook Valley,linking with    
 Wayoh and Entwistle reservoirs.The    
 sole purpose of the reservoir is to   
 regulate the flow of water in that    
 part of Bradshaw Brook lying south of 
 the embankment.It is a compensation   
 reservoir ,it is not used for drinking
 water.                                
 The water is used for recreational    
 purposes.It is stocked with coarse    
 fish and is used for sailing and      
 canoeing.It cannot be used for        
 swimming because of the cold and the  
 depth of the water(sixty five feet).  
 A section of the water has been       
 designated a Nature Conservation Area.
 Here birds are able to breed          </content>
