		<title>13RAMSGATE RAILWAY STATION</title>
		<content> This station is mainly a passenger and
 maintenance station.Not many trains   
 are handled here but there are many   
 sheds for maintaining trains to a high
 standard.Every 6 months trains enter  
 Ramsgate to be serviced-seats are     
 renewed,brake blocks renewed and in   
 the special pits mechanical overhauls 
 take place.There is a cleaning depot  
 where carriages are sprayed with acid 
 to eat away the dirt but not the      
 paint!The internal bodywork is cleaned
 with detergent and special chewing gum
 remover clears all sticky problems!   
 Most trains enter Ramsgate via Dover  
 and Canterbury-35 trains use this     
 route from London.45 trains leave     
 London via Chatham terminating at     
 Ramsgate.350 people work at the       
 station.The original leverbox and     
 hand levers to change points are      
 still used.                           </content>
