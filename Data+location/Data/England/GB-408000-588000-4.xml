		<content>   Arts and Crafts:                    
      Two independent craft shops have 
 recently been set up, one in          
 Netherwitton and one at a farm nearby 
 (Shelley). Both craftsmen design and  
 make pine furniture of a high         
 standard.                             
   Leek Club:                          
      The Leek Club has over 40        
 members. Money is collected during the
 year by a raffle and other functions  
 to provide prizes at the annual Leek  
 Show in September. Every exhibitor    
 wins a prize.                         
   Scouts:                             
      The 2 Scout companies are        
 extremely lively thanks to excellent  
 leaders. There are 16 cub scouts and  
 20 scouts. They meet once a week in   
 the W.I.Hall. Unfortunately it is only
 for boys.
