		<content>  The area consists of gently rising   
 land from a minimum height of{13m}in  
 the south east to a maximum of 52m.in 
 the east.                             
 An area of low-lying land(between{13m.
 and{23m}) is occupied by{Defford      
{airfield.}This is bounded to the west 
 by a north-south ridge of moderate    
 slopes, maximum height{32-33m.}The    
 highest land is in the eastern and    
 northern third of the region. More    
 moderate slopes are found above{30m.  
 culminating in a northern plateau at  
{43m.}in the area of{Lady Wood}and two 
 knolls at{52m.}in the east and{39m.}in
 the south east. The latter area forms 
 the site of{Defford village}above the 
 flood plain of the{Avon}to the south. 
 Surface drainage is not extensive but 
 two streams drain southwards while    
{Croome River}in the far west has been 
 made into a 1.5km. long estate lake.  </content>
