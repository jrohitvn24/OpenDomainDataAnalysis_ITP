		<content>Mrs.Harrison is a retired teacher who  
lives in a bungalow on the outskirts of
the village.She was born in Walgrave   
and came as a pupil to Walgrave School.
She trained as a teacher and taught in 
a poor part of Sheffield in 1929.She   
had a class of 43 children.We have 26  
in our class .She taught in Walgrave   
School for 13 years.She remembers that 
all the desks were partly iron and     
they had an ink well,and you dipped    
your nibbed pen into the ink,now we use
fountain pens and felt tips.The floors 
were wooden and you got splinters.The  
toilets were outside too.There were    
not any books to read nor any nice     
books to write in.The children sat in  
rows not in groups as we do now.
