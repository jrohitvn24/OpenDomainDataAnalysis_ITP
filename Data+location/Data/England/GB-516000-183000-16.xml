 we had the choice between peach flan  
 or Christmas Pudding and cream.

 Dress Competition and this gave the   
 whole school lots of enjoyment.       
  On{Thursday}afternoon we had our     
 Disco and class parties which were    
 great fun. Our party was by           
 candlelight which was also very
