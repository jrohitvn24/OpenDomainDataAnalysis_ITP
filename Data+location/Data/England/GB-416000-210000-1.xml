		<content> This area is gently undulating        
 Cotswold hill land, very free draining
 and devoid of water courses.   The    
 fields are generally large and many   
 are boarded by walls built of the     
 local; stone, traces of quarrying     
 remain.Long established woods are     
 few but there are several recent      
 plantations of conifers.   Farm       
 buildings are scattered over this     
 area, the older ones stone built,     
 others recently constructed, of modern
 materials; all the remaining land     
 being used for growing barley, wheat  
 and grass.   Human habitation is      
 sparce, only thirteen dwellings in the
 whole area.Remains of a wartime       
 airfield, comprising the tarmac       
 perimiter and track.Some of the old   
 buildings are in the centre of this   
 block of land.An ancient encampment is
 here &amp; is the only one not ploughed.  </content>
