		<title>16Parbold's Lost Footpaths</title>
		<content>{       }There are about 20 footpaths  
 in Parbold parish. They are not much  
 used and many would have been totally 
 forgotten if it were not for ramblers 
 and walkers. Many of the people who   
 have recently moved in to the area do 
 not know of the existence of many of  
 them, and it is felt that better use  
 would be made of them if there were   
 clear signposts - very few remain. It 
 is regarded as important that         
 footpaths be kept open, and there are 
 recommendations that a map of the     
 footpaths be drawn up, that school    
 children be made aware of them, and   
 that a Footpaths Officer be appointed 
 to provide information and            
 encouragement to the public. Otherwise
 footpaths and rights-of-way, as in so 
 many other parts of Britain, could be 
 lost for ever.
