		<title>11MR.CRASKE REMEMBERS.</title>
		<content>{Mr.Stanley Craske}came to school to   
 talk to us and answer our questions   
 because he is a very keen{amateur     
{local historian.}He was born in 1913  
 and came to our school when he was    
 three. He left when he was fourteen.  
 He told us about the teachers, mainly 
{Mr.Day,the Headmaster,}who died in    
 1981. When Mr.Craske left school he   
 went to work in the office of the old 
{Erpingham District Council.} He       
 eventually married and had one son who
 is a teacher in Essex. Mr.Craske has  
 been a widower for some years. He     
 remembers Sheringham as a town of two 
 styles, in summer a popular seaside   
 resort, in winter a "family" town     
 where most of the residents knew each 
 other and most were related by        
 marriage. Change has occurred slowly  
 but employment locally has diminished 
 and most young people leave town.     </content>
