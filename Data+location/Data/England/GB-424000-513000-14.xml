		<title>14A WEDNESDAY IN DARLINGTON</title>
		<content> At 7.15 in the morning my dad wakes   
 me. After breakfast,if I have time I  
 do my piano practice.                 
     With my bag on my shoulder I set  
 off to school.When I get there we have
 assembly,and then P.E. After play its 
 maths,I hope it isn't mental.Suddenly 
 the bell goes for dinner.I finish the 
 sum that I'm doing and go home for    
 dinner.I generally have a snack with a
 main meal at tea time. After lunch    
 it's French.  I enjoy that.  We have  
 recorder later,when we play lots of   
 different pieces.                     
     After school, I go straight to the
 Arts Centre for a piano lesson,which I
 share with my sister.I have tea at    
 home and then go to Guides.Thats my   
 favourite part of the day.I don't get 
 to bed until about 10.00p.m. because  
 that is when I get home from Guides.
