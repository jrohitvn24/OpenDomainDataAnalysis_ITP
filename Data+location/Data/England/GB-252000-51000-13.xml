		<content> Brixton village is 7 miles from       
 Plymouth City Centre where we buy     
 furniture, electrical goods, books    
 etc.from the big shops. Much of the   
 entertainment is in Plymouth, roller  
 skating, cinemas, theatre, swimming   
 pools. Many of the parents work in    
 Plymouth and some of their relations  
 live there &amp; in parts of the country. 
 Most of our families have cars. We use
 a nationwide network of roads for     
 business and holiday trips. There are 
 main roads, wide &amp; straight to enable 
 us to go fast for long distances from 
 the main roads. Smaller roads  lead to
 towns and villages. We also use cycles
 motorcycles and buses. Goods are      
 carried around our country by lorries 
 and vans of different sizes. Some     
 large lorries are allowed to carry up 
 to 38 tonnes. Heavy traffic in Brixton
 main street causes dangerous problems.</content>
