		<title>10Westerhope Police Station.</title>
		<content>   In Westerhope there is a small      
 police station with about 26 policemen
 - about 6 to 7 being on each shift.   
   Some policemen walk around          
 Westerhope and three cars patrol the  
 area. The station has no police dogs  
 but they can call for one if required.
   The police in Westerhope get a      
 variety of different jobs like        
 investigating burglaries, stolen cars,
 lost children, and road accidents.    
   The bad thing about the job is lots 
 of paper work to do. The hardest thing
 is to deal with children who are      
 knocked over by cars.                 
   The police do not get long holidays;
 they get 1 weekend a month and twenty 
 days a year.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
