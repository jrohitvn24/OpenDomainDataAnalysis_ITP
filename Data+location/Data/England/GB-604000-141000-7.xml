The land is quite hilly, but much of   
it has been levelled and roads have    
been built. There is a housing estate  
in  Willesborough, and a  road which   
leads to Sevington, has just recently  
been  finished. From the motorway a    
road leads to Â£The Street' carrying on 
to the William Harvey Hospital. In The 
Street the houses are Tudor   or and   
Georgian style. Hythe road is very     
busy during the morning when people    
make their way to work and school.It   
is now easier to take the motorway to  
avoid the congestion of Ashford.The    
motorway leads to and from Folkestone, 
London, and into Ashford.Along the     
side of the motorway there are grassy  
verges which are bordered by wooden    
fences.
