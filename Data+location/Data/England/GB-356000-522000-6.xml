		<content>    The three churches in the          
 block,St.Laurence at                  
 Morland,St.Barnabus at Gt. Strickland 
 and St.Cuthbert at Cliburn are very   
 much alive and playing a very active  
 part in village life.                 
    Morland Church is the Parish church
 of a huge rural parish stretching from
 Kings Meaburn to the motorway and     
 including ST.Barnabus a sister church 
 in this parish.                       
    St.Cuthbert is part of the United  
 Benefice of Clifton,Brougham,Cliburn  
 and Bolton with the vicar living at   
 Clifton.                              
    All three churches are in a good   
 state of maintenance and are          
 beautifully kept.In the case of large 
 rural parishes like these much depends
 on the active support of lay people   
 and this is very much so in the       
 runningof all the churches in the area</content>
