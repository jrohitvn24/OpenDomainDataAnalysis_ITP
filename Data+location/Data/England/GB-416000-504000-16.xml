		<title>16ATTITUDES IN GILLING WEST</title>
		<content> The residents of Gilling think that   
 life in the 1980s has been made easier
 with the help of modern technology.   
 Modern conveniences such as washing   
 machines and vacuum cleaners have made
 housework easier for most people.     
 Better housing is available.          
 Communication is easier and there are 
 opportunities for wider travel on     
 improved roads and transport. Senior  
 citizens are well cared for,and there 
 are better medical facilities.        
                                       
 People today are concerned about the  
 widespread unemployment,particularly  
 among young people. They are also     
 concerned about moral standards -high 
 divorce rate,break-down of family life
 and the rise in crime. The possibility
 of  nuclear  war  is also a  major    
 concern.                              
                                       </content>
