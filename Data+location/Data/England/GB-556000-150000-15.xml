 spastics.It was built in 1963 and     
 opened by H.R.H. Prince Philip in     
 1964.The school helps the students    
 (11-19)reach O level and A level      
 standard.                             
 The students are spastics because     
 their bodies are deformed and they are
 unable to control their movements.Some
 are unable to hear.All the students   
 are residential sharing their cheerful
 dormitories with other students.      
 To help them communicate there are    
 computers with finger grids on to     
 enable them to press the right        
 key.Wheelchairs are used for moving   
 around, some are electric and the rest
 are powered by hand.To help them relax
 they have a swimming pool which has to
 be permanently heated to help the     
 students' muscles.The school has its  
 own nature trail.         Tanya       </content>
