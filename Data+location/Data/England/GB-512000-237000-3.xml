		<title>03SHEFFORD CHURCHES</title>
		<content> There are four churches in Shefford.  
 The Parish church is Saint Michael's  
 and dates from the 14th century.It    
 used to be a Chapel of Ease from      
 Campton Church and shared the same    
 rector for many centuries but now     
 Shefford has it's own Vicar.          
     The Catholic church is called     
 Saint Francis' but it used to be      
 Saint George's Chapel and was one of  
 the first catholic churches to be     
 built after the Catholics were made   
 free again.                           
     The Baptist Meeting House was     
 built in 1825. It has a very old clock
 in it.It was built originally for the 
 Baptists ,the Methodists and the      
 Bretheren but the Methodists soon     
 built their  own church.              
     One of the Methodist families was 
 called Inskip.There is a gravestone   
 for Thomas Inskip who died in 1859.   </content>
