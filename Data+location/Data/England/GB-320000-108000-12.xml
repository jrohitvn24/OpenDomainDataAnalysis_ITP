		<title>12Getting to school,N.Upottery</title>
		<content>   One of the main features of the     
 traffic here morning and evening are  
 the school buses.The older children,  
 who go to Honiton or Taunton,are      
 picked up by full-scale coaches.The   
 younger ones,bound for the primary    
 school at Upottery village,are either 
 driven in by parents or picked up by a
 small fleet of yellow mini-buses,     
 driven by local ladies,and parked     
 during the day outside their cottages 
 or farm-houses.                       
   A sore point with certain parents is
 that,though your child is entitled to 
 go to school when he or she is "rising
 five",he or she is not entitled to a  
 place on the school bus.              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
