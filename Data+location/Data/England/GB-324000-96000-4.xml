		<title>04KILMINGTON</title>
		<content> Of the two villages and one hamlet in 
 this area, Kilmington is the largest. 
 The children in our school did a      
 survey of the village.  The children  
 in the Junior class organised         
 themselves into five groups and each  
 group took an area of the village to  
 investigate.   We decided to conduct  
 our survey by means of interviews, and
 drew up a sheet of questions which    
 each person interviewed would be      
 asked.                                
 There are 309 households in           
 Kilmington, and we have 155 included  
 in our survey.   At the remaining     
 dwellings, either no-one was in during
 the days when we called, or the people
 did not wish to answer questions.     
 It is thought that there has been a   
 village at Kilmington for over a      
 thousand years.   Kilmington is       
 mentioned in the Domesday Book in 1087</content>
