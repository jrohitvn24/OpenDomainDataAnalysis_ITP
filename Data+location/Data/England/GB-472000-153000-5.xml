		<content> THE ROADS _ Mr Mustoe, a resident in  
 Hook for many years says that the     
 roads have stayed the same. The A30   
 London _ Penzance and A32 Portsmouth _
 Reading intersect in the village      
 centre. Outside Hook the M3 and a road
 link to the A30 at the Dorchester Arms
 were new in 1971. The new estates have
 meant new roads with a by-pass linking
 A32 and A30 with the northern and     
 central sections completed.A small    
 roundabout has been built at their    
 intersection. The County Council will 
 join the southern section with a      
 tunnel under the railway when funds   
 permit. A new roundabout in Hook      
 centre has eased the congestion caused
 by the rush hour traffic from the new 
 offices and industry in the area. The 
 M4 motorway is also an important      
 destination for traffic through Hook.
