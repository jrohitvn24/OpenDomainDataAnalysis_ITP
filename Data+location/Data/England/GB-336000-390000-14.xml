		<content>  People are generally very sad about  
 the state of our area. Litter is      
 everywhere and although new houses are
 being built there are many more       
 falling down. People don't seem to    
 care any more, they have lost most of 
 their pride in their neighbourhood.   
 They think their city needs many      
 things. We need jobs. Once people have
 more money and pride in themselves    
 then they'll have more pride in their 
 neighbourhood. Children feel that     
 there is nothing for them to do.      
 Recently some clubs have started but  
 these aren't enough. There is very    
 little to do at the weekend. It's easy
 to get into trouble breaking windows  
 and fighting. They do this because    
 thay are bored. Older people feel     
 their neighbourhood isn't the same as 
 when they were young. People are not  
 as friendly any more.                 </content>
