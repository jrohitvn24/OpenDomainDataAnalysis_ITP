		<title>01Just Another Day</title>
		<content> I would get up to the smell of coffee 
because my Dad makes it every day.I    
would have coffee and read the papers  
in my parents bedroom while we discuss 
what we would do.Sometimes we would go 
on picnics and on other days we would  
ride our bikes,that is my brother and I
,or sunbathe or play tennis or cricket 
in Jubilee Field.In the afternoon we   
may go swimming.When the weather is    
nice we would have barbecues and eat in
the garden or if it is wet we might    
barbecue in the carport and eat in the 
house then we would play hot games     
inside like:Cribbage,Slam,Whist,       
Newmarket,Pontoon.Sometimes we play    
Monopoly and Chartbusters.But the      
favourite is"Trivial Pursuit"when we   
play this game we are amazed to see how
much each one of us knows.When it is   
late i get kicked off to bed.I quite   
like these days as everybody has fun.  </content>
