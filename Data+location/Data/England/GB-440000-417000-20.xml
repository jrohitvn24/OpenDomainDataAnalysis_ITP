		<content> The Domesday team comprised twenty    
 eight twelve to thirteen year old     
 pupils and two teachers (ages not     
 disclosed !).                         
   Groups consisted of four or five    
 pupils each taking responsibility for 
 two individual one kilometre squares. 
 Data collection was made complicated  
 as our D_Block was some distance from 
 our school and this caused            
 difficulties of transportation.       
   Questionnaires were devised, tape   
 recordings taken, formal letters      
 written, telephone calls made and     
 personal interviews arranged to enable
 us to gather all the necessary        
 information.                          
   The success of our survey has been  
 partly due to the very willing help we
 have received from many people in our 
 area.
