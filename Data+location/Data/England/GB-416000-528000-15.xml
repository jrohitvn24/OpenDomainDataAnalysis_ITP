		<title>15ESCOMB COUNTY JUNIOR SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The school was built in about 1862 as 
 two separate schools, for juniors and 
 for juniors and seniors, - an all age 
 Primary School.  In 1964 the seniors  
 were transferred to Vinovium School   
 and the two schools were amalgamated  
 under one headteacher.  In February   
 1967 all pupils were moved into Witton
 Park so that alterations could be made
 and two extra classrooms, a hall,     
 kitchen, staffrooms and toilets added.
 Witton Park was then closed and all   
 children transferred to Escomb school 
 in September 1968, housed together in 
 a listed building School.             
    The catchment area of the school is
 Escomb, Witton Park, Etherley Grange, 
 Etherley Dene and Greenfield Dene.    
 About 120 pupils are on the role,     
 a head and five class teachers, four  
 part-time teachers, an auxiliary, five
 domestic staff and two assistants.    </content>
