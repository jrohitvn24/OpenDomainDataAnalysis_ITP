		<title>17Burton Life Styles</title>
		<content> On the questionnaires there was a     
 section on Life Style.Some of the     
 questions were,Where do you do your   
 main shopping? What kind of electrical
 appliances do you have? Do you use the
 bus service?When we looked through the
 questionnaires we saw that nearly     
 everyone had a fridge and a washing   
 machine but not many people had       
 microwaves,dishwashers or videos.There
 were 1 or 2 people who said that they 
 did their main shopping in Doncaster  
 but most people shopped at Scunthorpe.
 The bus service isn't very popular    
 with most people because they said it 
 was expensive and rather infrequent.It
 was interesting to see what the people
 had written down for they all wrote   
 different things.There was a question 
 that asked people what they would miss
 the most,most people said they would  
 miss their washing machine the most.  </content>
