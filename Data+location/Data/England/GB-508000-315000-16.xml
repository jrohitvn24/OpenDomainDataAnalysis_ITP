		<title>16THE HORSESHOE PUB.</title>
		<content> The Pub is at Thurlby Cross Roads.    
 Many years ago the Pub was called the 
 Three Horseshoes but it was shortened 
 to the Horseshoe.This year they have  
 made a new part for children.I have   
 been there once.It is very nice but I 
 was not  allowed any drinks like      
 brandy whisky beer or cider.I was only
 allowed any pop,lemonade or orange    
 drinks.Ithink the parents part is the 
 best.It is not very big really.There  
 is a restaurant where you can eat     
 meals and play games like gambling and
 darts.The pub opens about six         
 o'clock and ends at eleven            
 o'clock.I like choosing from a menu   
 because it is fun being like mum and  
 dad.In the summer there are seats     
 outside where families can have drinks
 and little children can play games.A  
 goat is tethered in the garden which  
 saves cutting the grass.              </content>
