		<content> The river Granta flows from the South 
 East of our sector to the North West. 
 To the South the land rises from the  
 valley to over 300 feet. Trees and    
 meadows can be found along the valley 
 but as the land rises cereals are more
 common. The settlements of Gt.Abington
 Hildersham, and Linton lie in the     
 valley, the name endings suggesting at
 least Saxon history. Abington and     
 Hildersham are interesting, old,peace-
 ful and pretty villages. Linton is    
 busier, has several large housing     
 estates, ameneties and an industrial  
 estate.The main road in the sector,   
 the A604, runs along the valley with  
 the three settlements now by-passed.  
 The railway (now closed) follows ap-  
 proximately the same course a little  
 to the South. The sector is rural and 
 intensely farmed with both arable     
 farms and horticultural small-holdings</content>
