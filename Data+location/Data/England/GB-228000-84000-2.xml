		<title>02The Rural Landscape</title>
		<content> Our rectangle is rural. The land is   
 mostly covered by grass with some     
 crops e.g.Barley and Wheat.Many of    
 the fields are used for grazing and   
 for silage.The farms in our area are  
 dairy farms.The largest centre of     
 population in our area is Tregadillet 
 though not all of this village is in  
 our area.The other settlements are    
 Langore and Truscott.There is a lot of
 woodland in our area.The largest wood 
 is Trebusey.At Rings Wood there is an 
  Iron Age Fort.There is also a        
 disused railway in our rectangle which
 the enthusiasts hope to restore.The   
 railway tends to run beside the River 
 Kensey.The River Kensey runs from east
 to west across our rectangle and the  
 hills run from north to south.
