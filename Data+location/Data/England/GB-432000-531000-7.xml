		<title>07NICOLA'S SATURDAY</title>
		<content> Most weekends I go to Stockton with my
 family. Sometimes we stay just a short
 while and others a few hours. We have 
 lunch in a cafe called Carricks and it
 costs us about Â£2. Then we all split  
 up and meet at a certain time.After   
 shopping we go home and have a cup of 
 tea and something to eat.             
 After tea we go to my aunt's house and
 watch a video. I go back to my nana's 
 and give my mam a kiss because she    
 goes out with my dad and friends to   
 the pub on Saturday night. Then I go  
 to the fish and chip shop with my     
 auntie. We walk down together and I am
 left at my nana's for the night.      
 Before I go to bed I watch television 
 for a little while.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
