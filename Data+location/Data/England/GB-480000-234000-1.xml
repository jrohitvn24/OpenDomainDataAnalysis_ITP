		<title>01Shenley &amp; Whaddon Area</title>
		<content> Shenley and Whaddon are 2 villages in 
 North Buckinghamshire. Shenley Church 
 End &amp; Shenley Brook End are still two 
 quiet communities within the fast-    
 growing city of Milton Keynes. Plans  
 for their development are viewed      
 with mixed feelings by the local      
 inhabitants. Whaddon is however       
 outside the city's designated area.   
 The landscape is largely one of farm  
 and woodland with some good local     
 walks including one which takes the   
 walker along an old Drovers' Way.     
 There are several privately owned     
 moated sites, some unexcavated earth- 
 works, 2 19th C village schools, two  
 attractive churches &amp; 2 public houses.
 The population here is of mixed ages  
 &amp; interests.The majority of people are
 home owners &amp; have employment locally 
 although a significant minority       
 commute to London &amp; Northampton.      </content>
