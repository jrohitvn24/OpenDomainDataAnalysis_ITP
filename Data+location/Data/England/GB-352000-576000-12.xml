		<content> The area is a remote rural area and   
 consequently it gets services one     
 would expect in such a place.There are
 no street lights ,no mains gas and no 
 buses but the local council provides a
 refuse collection once a week, a      
 library van every three weeks, snow   
 clearance in Winter, education and the
 transport to get to the seat of       
 learning including a mobile nursery.  
 Most of the houses have mains water   
 and septic tank drainage, electricity,
 and telephone. The postman will also  
 take letters for posting as well as   
 delivering them. The milkman also     
 delivers newspapers and basic         
 groceries on the six days a week he   
 calls. There are several mobile shops 
 which visit on different days bringing
 most foodstuffs.
