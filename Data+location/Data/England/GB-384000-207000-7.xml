		<title>07Ghosts In Painswick</title>
		<content> The ghosts of the Fiery Beacon Gallery
 was seen eight years ago.There was a  
 big bright light at the end of a      
 corridor.This part of the building has
 now been closed off because all the   
 floor_boards are rotten.They say that 
 the ghost could have come from outside
 because all the village folk were     
 standing around with fiery torches to 
 burn the church down, many years ago. 
  The ghost at the Little Fleece book  
 shop is supposed to be an old man     
 called Mr Clutterbuck.He is supposed  
 to be looking for buried treasure.None
 of the people living in the house over
 the last twenty_five years have seen  
 him.The dog and cat who live there    
 now, have never shown a ghostly       
 presence.The haunted cellar is        
 believed to have housed prisoners at  
 the time of the civil war.
