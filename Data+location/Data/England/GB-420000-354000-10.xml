		<content> RELIGION - The largest Chapel         
 building, formerly the Congregational 
 Church,now the Village Hall.   The    
 smallest the Primitive Methodist,     
 built in stone 150 yrs ago, seats 50  
 but the membership has declined.      
 Three regular attenders each Sunday.  
 The Wesleyan Reform chapel, belonging 
 to the Bakewell Circuit, was built in 
 1852 of brick which is now rendered   
 with pebble-dash. The chapel seats    
 about 70 but has 6 members attending  
 services each Sunday.                 
 There are no other religious buildings
 in the village so Catholics go either 
 to Wirksworth or Ashbpourne for       
 worship.  Other denominations attend  
 meeting places outside the village, or
 as inthe case of a group of Christians
 termed Brethern, meet in one another  
 houses for worship, meditation and    
 prayers.                              </content>
