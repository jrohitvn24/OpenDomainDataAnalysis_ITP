		<content> Paxhill is an area of new houses and  
 bungalows built over the past 20      
 years. Different builders were        
 employed so there is a variety of     
 architecture. The occupants have      
 varied jobs the majority being        
 employed locally in Tewkesbury,       
 Worcester, Cheltenham and Gloucester. 
 Some are retired couples, others      
 young families who are first time     
 buyers. On the other side of Paxhill  
 there are a number of much newer      
 council houses, built within the last 
 10 years. Most of these house senior  
 citizens occupying 2 bedroom          
 accommodation. Further down the lane  
 are some older council houses built   
 about 30 years ago, some of which     
 still have there original occupants.  
 Behind them lie even more council     
 property built about 50 years ago.    
 Some are now privately owned.         </content>
