		<content> A small proportion remain             
 un-white-washed and present a pale red
 brick exterior. Some retain their     
 thatched roof.                        
                                       
 Black and white buildings appear      
 frequently. Most of these date back to
 16th + 17th centuries and old building
 methods have been revealed inside the 
 cottages during modernisation. Several
 farmhouses were built at least 150    
 years ago. A few were timber framed,  
 for example PINHILLS FARM but most    
 were brick built and now all their    
 roofs are tiled and windows enlarged.
