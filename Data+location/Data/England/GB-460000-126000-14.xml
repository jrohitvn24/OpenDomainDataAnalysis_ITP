		<title>14Transport in Bramdean</title>
		<content> Transport is of great importance in   
 Bramdean as most education, work,     
 entertainments and services such as   
 doctor's etc. are outside the village.
  The public bus service runs 5 buses  
 per day to the nearest market town (4 
 miles) and the nearest bus and train  
 station (9 miles).  There is no       
 service on Sunday, or return bus after
 5.30pm.  This severely limits evening 
 activities for those without their own
 transport.  The times of these buses  
 also make it inconvenient for people  
 who work extended hours.  A large     
 proportion of the households have a   
 car, though in many cases this is not 
 available while the main bread winner 
 is at work.  There is a considerable  
 problem for elderly people without a  
 car. Walking to the nearest village   
 is dangerous as the busy main road has
 no pavement.                          </content>
