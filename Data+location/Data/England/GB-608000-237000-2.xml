		<title>02Growth of Capel St Mary</title>
		<content>In 1957 Capel was a small scattered    
village with a population of 600.With  
the Parish Council's help a playing    
field was bought.Suffolk then decided  
to expand Capel and builders bought the
playing field.Two firms Wimpey and     
Comben began building on farmland North
and south of the main street.The       
population of Capel grew to 2500.The   
Parish Council and the new Community   
Council bought a recreation ground and 
through local fund raising and grants  
built a Village hall and pub.A new     
library started in Jan '85 and opening 
in Aug has been added.There will be one
assistant and 3,850 books.People can   
join at the age of 13 and under 13's   
can join with parents.4 books will be  
allowed each time.As the village grew a
doctor's surgery and pharmacy,a dentist
and a new shopping area were added.
