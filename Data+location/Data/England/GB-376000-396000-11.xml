		<title>11New industry in Patricroft</title>
		<content> On the site of Patricroft Engine Sheds
 and sidings (closed in 1966) there is 
 a small, active light industrial      
 estate (768 989) which is still being 
 built. It will house ten firms and at 
 the moment therer are mainly          
 wholesale, service industries and     
 light industries accomodated in single
 storey factory units.                 
 Industry on the banks of both the Ship
 Canal and the Bridgewater Canal has   
 declined and attempts to rebuild in   
 the area are not meeting with much    
 success at the moment. There are two  
 vacant factory sites at 767 979 and   
 769 978.                              
 There is no commercial traffic now    
 along the Bridgewater Canal but the   
 Barton Swing Aqueduct which carries   
 the Bridgewater Canal over the        
 Manchester Ship Canal is still open,  
 carrying weekend liesure traffic.     </content>
