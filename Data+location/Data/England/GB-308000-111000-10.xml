		<title>10A typical local farm</title>
		<content>   {   Bowhayes Farm,Culmstock.        
   farmed by Brian and Pat Churchill.  
              This is a 90 acre dairy  
 farm,which is small by today's        
 standards,holding a milk quota of     
 212000 litres.This means that a herd  
 of about 40 cows(Friesians)are run.The
 first 20 calves from these cows are   
 reared on the farm either for cow     
 replacement or beef and the remainder 
 are sold at the local market at       
 Tiverton Junction.Large beef animals  
 are sold at Taunton market.           
              A few sheep are kept and 
 the size of the flock will rise       
 because of the milk quota.The farm is 
 not ideal arable land,however, we do  
 grow about 10 acres of winter         
 barley.Breakcrops of stubble turnips  
 and ryecorn are grown as it becomes   
 necessary to reseed the grass fields.
