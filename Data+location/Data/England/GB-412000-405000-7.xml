		<content> Only two major roads run through this 
 area. They are the{A635}and the{A6024.
 The{B6106}also runs to Penistone from 
 Holmfirth. Most roads in the area are 
 minor roads and some are unmade. Buses
 run on the main roads to Holmbridge,  
 Holme and Parkhead from Huddersfield. 
 They are often littered.              
  The nearest B.R.{railway station}is  
 at Brockholes. The nearest{airports   
 are Manchester or Leeds and Bradford. 
 The nearest motorways are the{M1}and  
{M62.                                  
  Most people use cars to travel around
 the area. They get their petrol from  
 Holmfirth Coachworks, Burnlee and     
 sometimes have their cars repaired by 
 Mr.T.Battye, who has worked on his own
 in Hinchliffe Mill servicing cars for 
 33 years.
