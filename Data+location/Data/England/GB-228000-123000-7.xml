		<content> Around Clovelly there are many lovely 
{walks}including the coastal footpath  
 and a nature trail.  Many{streams}have
 their source in the area and have     
 deeply wooded valleys as they flow to 
 the sea.  Much of the deciduous wood  
 land is mature with some newer        
 coniferous plantations giving contrast
 Most woods are in steep valleys where 
 the plough cannot reach. In fields    
 where in the past hedges had been     
 grubbed up to make them larger,       
 crop rotation is practised and farm   
 yard manure is spread. Fuchsia,       
 geraniums and rhododendrons do        
 especially well. Gorse flourishes     
 in the Devon hedgebanks and on the    
 cliffsides .Domestic rubbish is       
 collected by Torridge.D.C., although  
 there are old tips. There is a        
 sewerage outlet into the sea.
