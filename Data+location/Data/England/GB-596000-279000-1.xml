		<title>01HOPTON/GASTHORPE AREA</title>
		<content> This area, boarded by the A1066, is   
 mainly agricultural consisting of     
 barley, sugar-beet, potatoes and dairy
 farming.  Hopton, the largest settle- 
 ment here, consists of a church, two  
 chapels, a post office, a public house
 and various small shops. From the     
 village, Hopton Fen slopes down to the
 River Little Ouse which flows from    
 west to east across the centre of the 
 area.  Rough grassland surrounds      
 Gasthorpe on the north side of the    
 river and it has a post office and a  
 few houses.  An old roman road runs   
 north from Gasthorpe to East Harling. 
 The area has covets planted for       
 shooting purposes. The airfield in the
 south-west corner is now used         
 privately.  Strips of deciduous wood- 
 land border the road.  The 40 acres of
 Riddlesworth Hall contains the Parish 
 Church and two other houses.          </content>
