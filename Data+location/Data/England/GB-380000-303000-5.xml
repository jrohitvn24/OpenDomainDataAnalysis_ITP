		<content> The village changed quite a lot when  
 the airbase was built.Many of the men 
 from Cosford came to the village and  
 married the ladies from Albrighton.   
 After the war traffic increased       
 greatly making the village a very     
 busy and dangerous place.In 1958 a    
 bypass was built.Albrighton is a      
 dormitory village for the West        
 Midlands. There was a good bus and    
 train service but both have been      
 reduced now. In the last              
 century there were 9 village cobblers,
 and 5 malt houses.There are now no    
 cobblers and the last malt house was  
 burnt down in 1972.In 1957 the old    
 school in Station Road was closed     
 because in 1952 a modern school had   
 been built to cope with the increasing
 population.Later a second school had  
 to be built to cope with increasing   
 numbers.                              </content>
