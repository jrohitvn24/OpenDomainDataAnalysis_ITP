		<content> The primary school closed in the mid  
 1970's and children are bussed to a   
 modern County Primary School at       
 Burnham Market, 3 miles away.         
 Children of the 11+ age-group travel  
 daily to the comprehensive school at  
 Wells-next-the-Sea, 5 miles away.  A  
 sixth-form centre is available at     
 Fakenham, 7 miles away, with a daily  
 bus service.  The Norfolk College of  
 Arts &amp; Technology at Kings Lynn (22   
 miles away) offers a range of further 
 education opportunities, and training 
 in practical skills for the 16+       
 age-group.  Students are collected by 
 bus from the village.  A varied       
 selection of evening classes is       
 available at all the mentioned        
 centres, but no transport is provided.
 There are Public Libraries at Wells   
 and Fakenham and a mobile library     
 visits the village once a month.      </content>
