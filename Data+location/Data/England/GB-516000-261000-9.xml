   We have lots of Disco's and the     
 Infants have there own as well.       
 Actors and puppeters visit us and put 
 on shows in the Hall.This is also our 
 gymnasium and dining room.            
   Every class also puts on plays for  
 parents and we enjoy it as well       
 although the teachers sometimes have  
 to shout so we can hear them.         
   We have swimming, netball, rounders,
 cricket, hockey, athletics and        
 football depending on the weather.The 
 rules are different as you get older  
 so thet you can enjoy the games even  
 if you are'nt very good at first.Some 
 people like cross-country running     
 around the playing field.
