 Stow is a small{town,}the highest in  
 the{Cotswolds.}Its position where two 
 ancient roads, the Salt Way and the   
 Roman{Fosse Way,}met has been added to
 so that now there are seven roads that
 meet at Stow.  This has brought many  
{travellers}to the area.  The Cotswolds
 were good{sheep}country and over 500  
 years ago Stow was granted the right  
 to hold two{fairs}a year when         
 thousands of sheep were sold. Now the 
{limestone}countryside is mainly{arable
 producing good corn crops. Maugersbury
 is a hamlet about a mile from Stow and
 the Swells are two small villages in  
 the valley to the west of Stow.       
 Although Stow no longer has a weekly  
 market it has a useful selection of   
 shops, including 32{antique shops!
