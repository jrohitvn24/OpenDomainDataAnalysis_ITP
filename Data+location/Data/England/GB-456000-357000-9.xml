 school,she cleans the house &amp; then    
 prepares the dinner ready for when we 
 come home.My dad who gets up about    
 9.00 to 9.30 plays with my brother    
 Christopher.At 11.30 they go to the   
 pit to collect his wages.In the       
 afternoon my dad takes mum to Tesco to
 do the shopping.After tea she makes my
 dad's sandwiches &amp; fills his flask so 
 that he can go to work.Then she has a 
 cup of tea while she sits watching the
 television with Christopher.After she
