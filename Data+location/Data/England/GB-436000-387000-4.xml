		<content>   A lot of heavy vehicles such as     
 lorries and transporters travel down  
 the main{roads}of Attercliffe and     
 Darnall and the surrounding areas.    
 This is because of the steel and      
 engineering works and the many        
 small new industries in the area.There
 is a wholesale{market}in Darnall and  
 many lorries and vans go there to     
 collect fruit and vegetables for      
 distribution over a wide area.        
   Regular{bus}services carry people to
 and from work.They are most busy from 
 8 a.m. to 9 a.m. and again from 5 p.m.
 to 6 p.m.at teatime. South Yorkshire  
 Passenger Transport bus services are  
 subsidised by the rates and are very  
 cheap to use. A bus trip for a child  
 costs only 2p. regardless of the      
 distance travelled. The adult fare for
 the three mile journey to the town    
 only costs 10p.                       </content>
