 Under the Benefice of the Rector of   
 Patrington it is situated in a field  
 surrounded by farmland and trees.     
 The Church, having only 25 pews, has  
 been in use since 1242.  It contains  
 three stained glass windows and 18th  
 century Hildyard memorials, one of    
 which being an altar tomb.  The       
 Chancel contains a large stone having 
 brass effigies of a knight and lady   
 with smaller brasses at their feet    
 representing their family; seven sons 
 and six daughters and is reputed to be
 a memorail of Sir Robert Hildyard of  
 Winestead KNT, commonly called "Robin 
 of Riddesdale" during the War of the  
 Roses. The lighting in the main body  
 of the Church is by candles in a      
 hanging brass chandelier, with
