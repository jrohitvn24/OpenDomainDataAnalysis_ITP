		<content> Bowes with Gilmonby recently          
 amalgamated with Startforth and       
 Boldron parishes.The Vicarage at Bowes
 was sold off. There are plans to      
 include the parishes of Rokeby and    
 Brignall in plurality.No resident     
 vicar in Bowes means a diminished     
 place in village life for the church  
 thus removing a focus for the         
 community.Presently an average        
 communicant congregation of less than 
 20 has to find not only a diocesan    
 quota of Â£1400 but also the cost of   
 maintenance,heating and lighting of   
 the church.The present incumbent has  
 reached retiring age and it may be    
 difficult to appoint an appropriate   
 replacement.The General Synod of the  
 Church of England has discussed the   
 possibility of replacing some clergy  
 in rural areas with more lay readers.
