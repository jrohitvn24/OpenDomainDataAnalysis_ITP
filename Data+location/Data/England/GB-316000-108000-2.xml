		<title>02SMEATHARPE AERODROME</title>
		<content> Smeatharpe Aerodrome was built in 1942
 by the United States Navy.            
 Approximately 2OOO Fleet Air Arm      
 personnel lived at the aerodrome from 
 which troops were transported during  
 the Second World War.                 
 Prior to the Americans coming to      
 Smeatharpe, there was only a narrow   
 country lane joining the village to   
 Newhouse.  To facilitate transport    
 they built a wider road through       
 Smeatharpe.                           
 The U.S. Navy also put in land drains 
 and mains water to the aerodrome, as  
 well as building a sewage works down  
 on Gotleigh Moor.  When the Americans 
 left in 1947, the villagers were      
 allowed to tap into the main water    
 drain.  Until then, they had relied on
 springs and wells.  The facility of   
 the sewage works was not taken up so  
 the residents still use septic tanks. </content>
