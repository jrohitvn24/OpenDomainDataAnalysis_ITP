		<content> The farming carried out in this area  
 is mainly dairy farming. The soil is  
 Harrogate clay and is unsuitable for  
 growing crops although some of the    
 land has been drained and is planted  
 with rye grass for silage. There are a
 few fields of barley and one of       
 potatoes. The rest is pasture and     
 meadows for grazing. There are 30     
 farms in our area. The biggest farm is
 Kirby's with 140 acres. They have 200 
 Friesan dairy cows, 250 bullocks and  
 100 heifers. They breed calves, make  
 their own silage and make 1000 bales  
 of hay every year.  There are 5 sheep 
 farms, 2 pig farms, 3 poultry farms   
 and the rest are dairy farms. Some    
 farmers keep a few chickens, ducks and
 pigs for their own use. One farmer    
 breeds pheasantsfor shooting on his   
 land.
