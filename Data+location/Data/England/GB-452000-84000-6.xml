		<title>06CRAFT WORKSHOPS AT ARRETON</title>
		<content>    The site known as Arreton Manor    
 Farm was originally part of a small   
 Medieval village clustered around the 
 12th Century St.George's church.      
     The farm buildings have been      
 converted to provide individual       
 workshops using original old timbers  
 and windows. The craftsmen and women  
 may change from time to time but as an
 example you may see a potter, leather 
 carver, printer, blacksmith and a     
 restorer of Victorian rockng horses   
 etc.                                  
     Many fine examples of             
 craftsmanship are displayed and can be
 purchashed direct from the makers.    
     The Country Craft Workshop at     
 Arreton remains the only working      
 crafts centre on the Isle of Wight.
