		<title>01Introduction to Lydden.</title>
		<content>The area which we have been given to   
investigate is predominantly rural in  
character.There are a number of farms. 
Crops are produced and sheep and       
cattle are grazed.It has a sprinkling  
of deciduous woodland and is of a hilly
nature.Much land is owned by the       
Ministry of Defence and is used for    
military exercises.The busy A2 by pass 
runs through the north of the area.The 
main centre of population is at Lydden 
with a small cluster of houses at      
Coldred.Most of the children in the    
area attend the local primary school   
at Lydden.Lydden has been described as 
a commuter village.There are few       
sources of employment in the area.There
is a road haulage firm adjoining the   
A2.The main Dover-Victoria railway line
runs through the district but there is 
no railway station.Lydden and Coldred  
are served by local bus transport.     </content>
