		<title>08A Milk Tanker Driver's Day.</title>
		<content>Buzz, buzz, it's 6.30 in the morning   
and there goes the alarm, it's time to 
get up. I have a coffee and take my    
wife Wendy and my son Adam one and off 
I go to work at the Milk Marketing     
Board, Brereton. After checking my     
lorry over and looking at the notice   
board to see if any farms need to be   
sampled (every farm tank is sampled at 
least once a week), off I go on my job,
which is called Bulk Milk Collection   
Driver. This means calling on farms    
which produce milk and sucking the milk
from their tanks into my tanker which  
holds over two thousand gallons, and   
takes a few farms to fill it. After    
leaving the Depot, I pick up at ten    
farms and after nine more my tanker is 
loaded. After unloading at the dairy I 
pick up another load and return to     
Ashby to unload. Then it is home to the
depot to get ready for another day.    </content>
