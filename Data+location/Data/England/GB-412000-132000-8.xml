		<content> OUR BLOCK CONTAINS THE ORIGINAL CITY  
 OF SALISBURY WHICH IS CALLED OLD      
 SARUM.  THIS WAS ORIGINALLY AN IRON   
 AGE FORTRESS OF THREE RING AND        
 DITCHES.  THE AREA WAS ALSO THE SITE  
 OF A ROMAN SETTLEMENT.  IN 1025 BISHOP
 HERMON PLANNED THE BUILDING OF A      
 CATHEDRAL ON THE TOP OF THE HILL AND  
 THIS WAS FINALLY COMPLETED IN 1092 BY 
 BISHOP OSMUND.  UNFORTUNATELY WITHIN A
 WEEK OF CONSECRATION A SEVERE STORM   
 CAUSED CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE TO THE     
 CATHEDRAL.  THE REMAINS OF THE        
 ORIGINAL BUILDING ARE STILL TO BE SEEN
 ON THE SITE.  OLD SARUM WAS ONE OF THE
 LAST OF THE ROTTEN BOROUGHS AND A     
 COMMEMMORATIVE STONE HAS BEEN ERECTED 
 ON THE SITE OF THE PARLIAMENT TREE    
 WHERE THE ELECTIONS USED TO BE HELD.  
 THE PITTS WERE NOTABLE MEMBERS ELECTED
 FROM THIS PARISH.
