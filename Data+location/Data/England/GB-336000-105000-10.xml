		<title>10  SHOOTING AT CRICKET 1985</title>
		<content>  Shooting at Cricket St Thomas.It     
 starts like this.Dad starts putting   
 the pens up then he goes and checks   
 the other pens.If there all right he  
 rings up his Boss and sees what       
 shooting dates there are.Dads Boss is 
 called Nicholas de Savary.Dad needs to
 know how many Pheasants and Ducks are 
 needed.Dad then has to order Pheasants
 and Ducks.He rings up Brian Mears and 
 he is the man who breeds the birds.He 
 tells Dad when he will bring the      
 Pheasants and Ducks.After a few months
 he lets the birds out after fattening 
 them up.Then he leaves them for a     
 fortnight.Nicholas rings up my Dad and
 tells him he's coming shooting and Dad
 rings up the beaters and tells them to
 meet outside the Big House at         
 9.00am.After the  shooting we come    
 back,have a cup of tea,get our money  
 and count the birds we got.           </content>
