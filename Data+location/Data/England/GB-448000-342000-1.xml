		<content>   Our project covers most of Awsworth,
 Kimberley, Nuthall, Strelley and      
 Cossall. Much of the area is farmland,
 especially round Babbington, Strelley 
 and Cossall. However, there are some  
 industries in one or two areas. At    
 Kimberley, there is a brewery and a   
 timber merchants while at Awsworth    
 there is a concrete firm and a new    
 garden centre.                        
   In the north west part of the area  
 the river Erewash and the Nottingham  
 Canal can be seen near the iron       
 viaduct and a big coal plant has just 
 been built nearby. The M1 motorway    
 crosses the south east of the area and
 is easily linked to Awsworth, Nuthall 
 and Kimberley by good roads. Between  
 Nuthall and the motorway there is     
 Temple Lake and near Strelley is the  
 wooded area of Spring Wood.
