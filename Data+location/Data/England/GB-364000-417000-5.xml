		<title>05DRY-STONE WALLING</title>
		<content> Spitlers Edge is marked by a typical  
 dry-stone wall running from the top of
 Winter Hill to Redmonds Edge, where it
 becomes replaced by wooden posts or   
 stumps.  These walls are a feature of 
 this moorland area, and divide up the 
 pastures.  The stone was quarried     
 locally and abandoned quarries are    
 clearly seen e.g. Adam's Delf and     
 Naylors.  Some of the walls are sadly 
 dilapidated, but recently some have   
 been restored by the North West Water 
 Authority.  They also have put up a   
 new wooden fence along both sides of  
 the A675 to prevent sheep straying    
 onto this busy main road.             
 The abandoned dwellings are usually   
 surrounded by walls, with a few trees 
 such as sycamore remaining to mark the
 site.  The same local stone was used  
 for all these buildings.
