		<title>15PERSONAL NAMES</title>
		<content> Local children carried out a survey to
 record their names and those of their 
 parents and grandparents. Some names  
 have stayed popular; for males,{James 
 has been consistent, with{Richard}and 
{John}only less so recently, when{Mark 
 and{Stephen}have taken their places.  
{Margaret}also has remained popular but
 lately has declined,{Sarah}being the  
 most popular girls' name in the       
 1980's.{Ann(e)}is a lasting favourite.
 Other names have been popular in one  
 generation only; many children's      
 parents were called{Susan,}or{Alan,   
 names which were uncommon at other    
 times. Their grandfathers were often  
 called{William}or{George,}the latter  
 almost unused since. For grandmothers,
 flower names, like{Lily,}were common, 
 while{Pamela}was popular with mothers.
 There is a wider variety of childrens'
 names, with foreign ones like{Natasha.</content>
