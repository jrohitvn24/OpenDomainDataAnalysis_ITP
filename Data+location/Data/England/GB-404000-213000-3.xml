		<title>03THE   PEOPLE   OF   YANWORTH</title>
		<content>{    Yanworth is mentioned in the first
{Domesday Book}but the name is probably
 Anglo-Saxon / Old English  _   meaning
 "Geana's Word" or "lamb enclosure".   
     Yanworth was recently described in
 a local newapaper  as  "a small sleepy
 village where time seems to have stood
 still for centuries", and in one guide
 book  as  "a small sleepy village".{In
{the 1981  census unemployment was zero
 and the open air life far from sleepy.
    {Census night}(April 5 1981) saw 66
 males  and  55  females  as  the usual
 resident  population  and  7 visitors,
 (total 128).  The 1971 figure was 137.
 Most  Cotswold  parishes  are   either
 increasing with  housing  developments
 etc.  or decreasing  with  movement to
 towns etc.  {The preponderance of tied
{cottages  offering  security  while in
{work and in retirement probably  helps
{explain this population stability.    </content>
