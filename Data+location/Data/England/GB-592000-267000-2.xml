		<content>  The Junior class went to see a lady  
called Miss Loach who has lived in the 
village for many years.                
Q.How long have you lived here?        
A.Since 1947,which is 38 years.        
Q.Why did you move here?               
A.Because I love the Suffolk country   
 side.                                 
Q.Was Manor Garth built?               
A.No,there was a field that belonged   
to me.                                 
Q.Why did you sell the field?          
A.The Council purchased part of it to  
build the School on - I had no         
choice.The part that remained was not  
big enough to do anything useful with, 
so I sold it for building land.        
Q.Did the watermill and windmill work? 
A.Yes we got chicken feed from the     
windmill.                              
Q. Was there a baker in Pakenham?
