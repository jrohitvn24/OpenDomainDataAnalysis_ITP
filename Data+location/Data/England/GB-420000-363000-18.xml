		<content> The Scout Hut committee is raising    
 money to build a new Scout Hut. They  
 have recently received a cheque for   
 Â£8,500 from a well-wisher.            
 Five new houses have been built at the
 bottom of Bradford. Six houses are    
 being built on Conksbury Lane and my  
 Dad is complaining because they will  
 overlook our house.                   
 Recently 250 fish were stolen from the
 fish farm at Alport.                  
 The Waterworks Committee is putting   
 new plastic water pipes in because the
 old ones are rotting and getting      
 clogged up with dirt.                 
 A teacher is leaving the school       
 because there are not enough children 
 coming in.                            
 A collection in the village to raise  
 money to buy televisions for the Royal
 Chesterfield Hospital raised Â£775.
