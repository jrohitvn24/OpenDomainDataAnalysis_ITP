		<title>05THE MILL HOUSE</title>
		<content>     Charlotte Fagg, a pupil at        
 Hollingbourne School.                 
     Great grandfather took over the   
 mill as miller in 1906 and kept the   
 mill in full running order for 44     
 years until it broke down beyond      
 repair, but they still lived at the   
 mill until 1951.                      
     In 1914 my grandmother was born   
 and named Iris because her eyes were  
 as blue as the iris that was growing  
 beside the mill stream. She is still  
 living in the village.                
     The pond very often used to empty 
 due to the constant use of the mill   
 and therefore was kept very clean. The
 pond used to be filled naturally by a 
 spring running underground from the   
 Downs.                                
     The mill was mentioned in the     
 Domesday Book and it is said that     
 monks used to fish in the pond.       </content>
