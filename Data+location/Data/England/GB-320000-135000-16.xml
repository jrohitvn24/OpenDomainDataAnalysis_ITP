		<title>16A SPAXTON FARMERS DAY</title>
		<content> The alarm clock goes and the farmer   
 wakes up at six aclock. He goes and   
 gathers up his cows and takes them to 
 the milking parlour he puts the cups  
 on the cows teats and turns on the    
 switch and it begins to milk the cows.
 when it finishes the farmer puts the  
 cows back into the field and then     
 washes the milking parlour. Next he   
 feeds his cows and does a few odd     
 jobs. Then he has his breakfast and a 
 cup of tea at about nine aclock. After
 that if it is spring the farmer gets  
 in his tractor and ploughs two acres  
 and sows a field of peas. By that time
 it is time for lunch. He has his lunch
 and then has a look at his crops and  
 then he goes into town to get some    
 animal feed for the pigs. He comes    
 back for milking time again. The milk 
 tanker comes and gets the milk. He has
 his tea, checks his stock, bed at 10pm</content>
