		<title>01THE WOLDS</title>
		<content>  The countryside is mainly rolling    
 wolds in agricultural use. In the     
 shallow valleys are small attractive  
 villages including{Wymeswold, Hoton,  
{Burton-on-the-Wolds,}and{Prestwold.   
                                       
    {Burton-on-the-Wolds}lies in a     
 shallow hollow giving the impression  
 of compactness. It is centred on the  
 Melton Road/Barrow Road junction. Much
 infilling of the old village pattern  
 has taken place in the last twenty    
 years. 32 houses built before 1939,   
 130 built since. The older cottages   
 are brick with slate roofs; 2 of      
 Swithland slate. All but 12 of the    
 newer houses are detached, brick with 
 tile roofs.                           
 1 pub, 1 garage, 2 shops, 1 chapel,   
 1 village hall, 3 industrial sites.   
                                       
                                       </content>
