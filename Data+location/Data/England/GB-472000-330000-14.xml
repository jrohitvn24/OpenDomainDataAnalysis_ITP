		<title>14A TYPICAL DAY.</title>
		<content> I live in the village of Harby and I  
 am ten years old.Most days I get up at
 half past seven.At a weekend I also   
 get up at that time because I go to   
 ballet lessons.On Sunday I have a lay 
 in.                                   
 During the week we have to be at      
 school for 9.00 am.While I am not at  
 school my hobbies are horse riding and
 ballet.I also like cooking and        
 animals.                              
 When I have helped do the house work, 
 such as tidying my bedroom or cleaning
 the windows,I watch the television.My 
 favourite programme is a soap opera   
 called Dallas. If I am not doing      
 anything I play with my friend on a   
 skateboard down Watson's Lane.        
                                       
 I go to bed around half past eight or 
 nine o'clock.                         
                                       </content>
