 Burnhope is a small former pit village
 surrounded by farming land.It is      
 situated on the top of a hill and is  
 noted for its beautiful and           
 spectacular views.                    
 Lanchester is a very large village    
 dating back to the Romans.The site of 
 the Roman fort which accommodated 400 
 men is now just an uneven field and a 
 few stones.Most of the stones         
 were taken to build All Saints Church 
 and the houses round the village      
 green. Lanchester,a former            
 agricultural centre is now a very     
 popular residential area. {
