		<title>09WILDLIFE OF BEDGEBURY AREA</title>
		<content>   The fauna and flora of the Bedgebury
 area are very varied as is expected in
 a large area of mixed woodland.  There
 have been recorded by Mr Fuller, the  
 Forestry Commission Head Ranger in    
 this area, some 75 different species  
 of birds, 11 of butterflies, and 20 of
 animals and reptiles, as well as      
 numerous species of trees, flowers and
 grasses.                              
   Mr Fuller's job involves keeping    
 watch on all forms of wildlife in     
 Bedgebury and, where necessary,       
 controlling their numbers in order to 
 protect the tree crops from damage    
 which could eventually result in loss 
 of revenue to the Forestry Commission.
 Control methods include trapping,     
 shooting and ferreting, and are aimed 
 at two major species, Grey Squirrel   
 and Common Rabbit, which are the major
 damage causers.                       </content>
