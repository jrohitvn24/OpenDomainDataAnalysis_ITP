		<title>10MEAFORD POWER STATION</title>
		<content> Meaford Power station draws its water 
 supply from the river Trent and is    
 situated beside the flood plain.It    
 employs 160 men and generates 240     
 megawatts of electricity.There are    
 four boilers which burn 25-30 tonnes  
 of pulverised fuel each and generate  
 for 10 hours a day five days a week.  
 There are five cooling towers which   
 dominate the landscape.The "B" station
 generates the power,the "A" station   
 became obsolete and was demolished.All
 coal has to be transported into the   
 power station by road.This has caused 
 the road to subside.                  
   The Power station has its own       
 private club with licensed bar and    
 function room also sports facilities  
 including bowling green and tennis    
 courts.
