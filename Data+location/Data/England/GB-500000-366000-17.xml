 In 1961 the national census told us   
 the population of Branston was        
 2,O38.In 1971 census figures for      
 Branston told us the population had   
 increased to 2,519. In 1981 the census
 figures told us the population had    
 increased to 3,211. This means the    
 population has increased by about     
 1,2OO in 2O years.We obtained the     
 population estimates for 1982 and 1983
 from the county council. These showed 
 that the population could go up by 150
 by 1983,to 3,349. This means that by  
 1985 the population of Branston would 
 be nealy 3,500 people, an increase of 
 72% since 1961. After the war lots of 
 building started. Three new estates   
 are now finshed because more people   
 have come to live in Branston.
