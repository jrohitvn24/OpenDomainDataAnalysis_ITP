		<content> For the afternoon school session I    
 leave home at one o'clock. I play     
 elastic with my friends until the bell
 goes at one twenty five. The first    
 lesson is history, which is about our 
 school in days gone by. The school is 
 one hundred and twenty two years old. 
 This is followed by art and craft. For
 the last session I continue my work in
 geography. School finishes at three   
 thirty but I stay on for the badminton
 club; for this I go to the new Youth  
 and Community Centre which is very    
 near the school. I play until five    
 o'clock when I go home. In the evening
 I go to the local Youth Club where I  
 meet my friends and we go roller      
 skating. After buying some            
 refreshments I leave as I have to be  
 home for nine o'clock.
