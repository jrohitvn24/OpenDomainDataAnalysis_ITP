		<title>04OX-HAYE FARM</title>
		<content>Ox-Haye farm is in the south-east      
corner of our study area.  It is owned 
by Mrs. Chadwick who is 89 years old   
and has lived in the same farm building
for over fifty years.                  
     The farm itself has fourty-nine   
acres of land most of which is grazing 
land.  The farm-house is a very        
impressive building which has changed  
little in Mrs.Chadwick's time. There is
a very large kitchen with stone salting
benches which Mrs.Chadwick still uses  
to salt her bacon.                     
     Attached to the farm buildings is 
a cow shed that is now considered too  
cramped for modern day use.            
     Mrs.Chadwick states that when she 
first arrived there was no water supply
or bathroom. One of the three bedrooms 
was later converted to accommodate     
one.
