		<title>17SURVEY OF WOODFORD TREES</title>
		<content>   We drove about the Woodford Valley  
 looking for trees. We counted 68 Oak  
 trees , we found out that the Oaks    
 went in rows and once they started    
 they went on for quite a while. The   
 Sycamore scattered itself hither and  
 thither all over the country side. We 
 noticed 71 Sycamore trees as this is  
 an area with many of them. We didn't  
 notice many Beeches, but even fewer   
 Horse Chestnuts, 40 Beeches &amp; 13 Horse
 Chestnuts. A large and sturdy figure  
 of a Plane tree was only seen twice.  
 Willows scattered themselves by the   
 river,we saw 82 and also 63 Ash. Limes
 were not common &amp; there were only 10. 
 We only saw 27 Elder trees which      
 surprised me because in the Autumn the
 area was full of Elder berries on     
 Elder trees. We were astounded to see 
 elms which were alive, and we counted 
 65 of them.                           </content>
