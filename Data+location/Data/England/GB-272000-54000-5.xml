		<title>05MOVING AROUND DIPTFORD</title>
		<content> The car is now the chief way of       
 getting around. A high percentage of  
 the population own cars and are       
 therefore very mobile. For those      
 people who have no transport they can 
 be helped by the school{bus}service.If
 they pay amall fee they are allowed   
 travel into the local                 
 town,Totnes.There us to be an old {   
{railway}line which ran from South     
 Brent to Kingsbridge by the river     
 Avon.                                 
 It  was builtin 1862 butunfortunately 
 affluence and progress caused the     
 closure of the line in 1963.          
 The Diptford {Car }Scheme enbles      
 anyone to travel by private car for   
 the small sum of 1Op per mile to any  
 destination. The scheme started in    
 1979 after a survey organised in 1979 
 by the Womens Institute.
