		<content>    Even though Mr.Parratt is the      
 Headmaster of this school, each       
 morning he takes a class of top       
 juniors and in the afternoon he does  
 group activities such as games, art   
 etc.The teachers at the school are    
 fairly strict on discipline and expect
 their pupils to know what self        
 discipline means by the time they     
 leave.Unfortunately a small percentage
 of children still lack self           
 discipline.Mr.Parratt feels that over 
 all the years he has been teaching,   
 this problem has increased.
