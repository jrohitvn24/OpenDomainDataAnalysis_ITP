		<title>13Hobbies &amp; Pastimes(Robin,11)</title>
		<content>My main interest is drawing. I like    
drawing because when I'm bored I just  
look out the window, and there's       
something for me to draw. Sometimes I  
draw out of my own imagination and     
sometimes draw out of comics and books.
I like drawing cars, motor bikes and   
lorries. My favourite subjects are     
space pictures and aliens from other   
galaxies. Other people's Hobbies,      
interests and pastimes, things like:   
collecting stamps, postcards, rubbers, 
comic books, posters, old model cars,  
Airfix, and computer games. Some peo-  
ple like photography and bird-watching.
One or two people here like trains and 
train spotting. A lot of people        
like pop groups like Wham! and Duran   
Duran which I like as well. People go  
to their concerts to watch them play,  
and scream like anything at them,      
because they like them.                </content>
