		<title>16SHOPPING AROUND CONSETT</title>
		<content> We did a survey of the shopping habits
 of the 64 families of the children in 
 the Junior Department of our school.  
 About two thirds of the families went 
 to Consett for their main shopping    
 About one quarter go to Stanley.      
 About one quarter use the small local 
 shops near their homes.The rest visit 
 Newcastle, Durham,Leadgate,Washington 
 and Annfield Plain.38 out of the 64   
 families used a supermarket.25        
 families used a hypermarket or        
 superstore.16 used their small local  
 shops. Every family used their local  
 shops every week.22 families used them
 once a week.27 families used them     
 often .26 families used them every    
 day.{The survey shows that most       
{families prefer to use the large shops
{which can only be found outside our   
{block for their main shopping.It also 
{shows that local shops are important. </content>
