		<content> The oldest part of the house was a    
 medieval{Bastle,}a fortified house.   
 Some of the walls are seven feet      
 thick. It is a{listed building}which  
 means that it cannot be altered       
 without permission from the Department
 of the Environment. The other reason  
 for its preservation is that it has   
{gin_gang,}a round,stone building once 
 used for grinding corn. There are two 
 wells, but spring water is now used.  
    The farm_house served a tenanted   
 farm until 1967 when Mr.&amp; Mrs. Chapman
 bought it. They own a wholesale       
 vegetable firm in Newcastle and used  
 the house as a country cottage, but   
 now they live there permanently. They 
 enjoy taking{bed and breakfast}       
 visitors especially those from Norway,
 the U.S.A, Holland &amp; Germany. The     
 house still has old "privies" but     
 there are modern toilets &amp; septic tank</content>
