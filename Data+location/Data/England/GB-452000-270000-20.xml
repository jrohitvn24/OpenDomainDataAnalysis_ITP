   Both Barby and Kilsby have their    
 Cub, Scout, Guide and Brownie packs.  
 The Scouts in Kilsby are a very active
 group who take the children away      
 often. The Cubs meet in the school and
 are well supported.                   
                                       
   The Kilsby Guides meet every        
 Wednesday. Mrs. Wilton is Captain and 
 Mrs.Blackwell and Mrs.Probert help.   
 They go on camps, swim and have       
 cook-outs.                            
                                       
   Barby Cubs meet on Tuesdays at 6.15.
 Barby Cubs like to use Youth hostels  
 for their visits.                     
                                       
   The Guide Uniform is a navy blue    
 skirt, blue blouse, Red Neckerchief   
 and a blue beret.
