		<title>17CHURCH OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</title>
		<content> The Roman Catholic  Church of the Holy
 Spirit is built on an imposing site in
 Bath Road overlooking the valley.Built
 in the Byzantine  Style its dome makes
 it an impressive landmark.            
 A  well  established  claim to fame is
 through  the  close  connection  of an
 earlier  young  Parish  Priest, Father
 John O'Connor  and  his  close  friend
 G.K. Chesterton.  Chesterton was not a
 Catholic  and said that he had no more
 intention  of becoming a Catholic than
 of becoming a cannibal. Having studied
 Catholicism seriously he was converted
 and became  one of the  most  eloquent
 voices  among  the  Catholic  laity of
 England.   Chesterton  was  of  course
 writer of short stories, novelist,poet
 essayist,  and  critic  and having met
 Father O'Connor based the character of
 Father Brown on his dear friend.
