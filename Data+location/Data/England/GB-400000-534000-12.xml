		<content> This is an ideal{tourist area,}with   
 lovely riverside walks, open moors,   
 woodland areas and open spaces with   
 shallow streams, ideal for children.  
 Many{daily visitors}come from the     
 Sunderland area, and many others are  
 attracted by the part of the{Wear     
{Valley Walk}which runs through        
 Frosterley.  There are plans to       
 designate the whole Wear Valley as an 
{Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.   
                                       
 Shopkeepers and the public house rely 
 on tourists for their profits.        
 There are a number of{summer cottages 
 in Frosterley and in the hamlets of   
 Hill End, White Kirkley and           
 Bishopley.There are four small{caravan
{sites,}two behind the main street in  
 Frosterley and two in Bollihope. One  
 of these also has chalets. All have   
 toilets and hot and cold water.       </content>
