		<title>06Churches in Capel St Mary</title>
		<content>The churches within Capel are the      
Parish Church of St Mary which is      
Anglican,the Methodist church and a    
redundant church at Little Wenham.The  
latter was built in the 14th C and     
repaired 1981 but is now only used on  
special occasions.                     
About 1/2 the school children dont't go
to church.More go to the Methodist than
the Parish but the parish church is    
much more popular with adults.Least    
children go to the Roman Catholic      
services which are allowed to be held  
in the Parish Church.                  
The Methodist church was built in 1883.
The minister is Rev.Hawkes and he has  
been there for 2 years.The regular     
congregation is about 185.             
The Rector of the Parish church takes  
services,visits people(especially if   
they are sick),takes assemblies and    
teaches R.E.in the primary school.     </content>
