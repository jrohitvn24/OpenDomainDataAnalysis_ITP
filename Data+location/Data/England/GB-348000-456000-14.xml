		<title>14Burrowbeck Estate: Housing</title>
		<content> Burrowbeck, an estate in the suburbs  
 of Lancaster, consists of about 150   
 houses, all built in the last 10      
 years.  There are a lot of detached   
 and semi-detached houses,  all of     
 modern design with a lot of glass.  Up
 on a hill there are a few small blocks
 of flats with three storeys.  The     
 estate has been built on farm land and
 there are still fields to build on.   
 Bailrigg village still has houses     
 being built although there are a few  
 old houses as well.  The village is a 
 dead-end.  The most peculiar house in 
 the village has a flat roof and was   
 built in the 1930s and is white.  At  
 the university all the students live  
 in blocks of flats.  Among these      
 modern buildings there is a Tudor     
 house, called Bailrigg House which was
 private, but is now the medical centre
 for the University.                   </content>
