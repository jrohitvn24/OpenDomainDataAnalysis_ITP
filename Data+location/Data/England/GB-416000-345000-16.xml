		<title>16A Walk Round Ashbourne.</title>
		<content> Many houses in Ashbourne are old and  
 beautifully decorated with pillars    
 and balconies.Footscrapers show how   
 dirty streets used to be.Some windows 
 had faulty glass or were even bricked 
 up because glass was so expensive.    
 In Ashbourne there are{almshouses}over
 three hundred years old.They were     
 built so that old people would have   
 somewhere to live. Some streets are   
 cobbled from the days when horses     
 were used.On the corners of these     
 are pillars to protect the walls      
 from cart wheels.Some streets have    
 names that remind you of the past such
 as Hall Lane and Tunnel Yard.{Gas     
{lamps}were used to light these        
 streets.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
