		<content> The coastguards are a Government      
 department. There are 560 full time   
 coastguards and many auxillary        
 coastguards who are paid for the hours
 of duty they work. The English        
 coastguards are part of a united      
 maritime organisation which looks     
 after coasts all around the world. In 
 our area there are 15 auxillary       
 coastguards and one full time officer.
 The coastguard keeps in touch with    
 ships through British Telecom phones. 
 our local coastguard looks after an   
 area from Preston Docks to Arnside.   
 There is a coastguard station at      
 Rossall Point. The coastguard has a   
 VHF radio that enables him to speak to
 any one of the 24 coastguard sites    
 around the British Isles.
