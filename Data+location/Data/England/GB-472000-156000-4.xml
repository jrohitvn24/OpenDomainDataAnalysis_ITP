		<content> The hamlets of West Green, Phoenix    
 Green &amp; Dipley fall within the{Parish 
{of Hartley Wintney.}The rest of the   
 block is in the{Parish of Heckfield   
{with Mattingley &amp; Rotherwick.}There   
 are Churches at each of these settle- 
 ments but only one Rector. The C.15   
{Mattingley Church}is the only church  
 in the block &amp; is used every 3rd week 
 for{Holy Communion}at 08.30,{Morning  
{Service}at 10.30 &amp;{Evensong}at 18.30. 
 There is the ocasional wedding or     
 funeral (there are a few spaces left  
 in the Churchyard) &amp; the usual Church 
 Festivals. The half-timbered Church   
 with its herring-bone brickwork is    
 unique &amp; is well maintained. As the   
 Parish is so rural, the{Rector}visits 
 his Parishioners &amp; delivers the Parish
 magazine by bicycle.
