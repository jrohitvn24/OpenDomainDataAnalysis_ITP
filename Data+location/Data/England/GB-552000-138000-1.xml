		<content>   This area is split by the main A264 
 road running east from Tunbridge Wells
 to East Grinstead.On one side of this 
 is the mainly residential village of  
 Langton Green.Many of the inhabitants 
 commute daily to work in London.There 
 is also the smaller settlement of     
 Fordcombe,a typical Kentish village on
 the lip of the Medway Valley.         
   The predominent land use is of mixed
 farming: cereal crops, hay, pastoral  
 farming and fruit growing.            
   The landscape is gently undulating, 
 dotted with small areas of woodland.  
   There are three large manors, which 
 used to own most of the surrounding   
 land.There is also the very popular   
 climbing area of High Rocks, in the   
 South Eastern corner of the 4x3km     
 block.
