		<title>15EARLY LANGAR</title>
		<content> The{Domesday Book}records that Langar 
 was 'possesed of half a church',which 
 wasn't completed  until 1200.         
 The small village between the manor   
 house and the River Smite.            
 Before 1066 it was owned by Godrick   
 the Saxon.St Andrews Church is the    
 largest in Notts.We think the church  
 was large because of all the visitors 
 who came to St Ethelburgha's Priory   
 near Langar.This has now disappeared. 
 Some very important people have been  
 buried at Langar especially the       
{Scroopes}and{Howes,}whose magnificent 
 tombs are in the North and South      
 transepts.At the West end is a        
 splendid stained glass window.The     
 church,partly restored in {Victorian  
 times by{Thomas Butler},father of the 
 famous{Samuel Butler},is well worth a 
 visit.A flower Festival is held over  
 the Whitsun Holiday.                  </content>
