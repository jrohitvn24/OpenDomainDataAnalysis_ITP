		<title>02  Radcot  Bridge, Part 1</title>
		<content> Although known locally as "Radcot     
Bridge" there are infact three separate
bridges within 200 yards.On approaching
from the north you first cross Pidnell 
Bridge, dating from 1863; then on to   
Navigation Bridge built in 1787. This  
single arched bridge was built to cross
a widened sidestream which became the  
new main stream.The three arched Radcot
Bridge, the oldest over the Thames, now
only spans one of the backwaters.      
 This complex of bridges and ancient   
wharves results from the original      
importance of Radcot as a centre for   
shipping stone from Burford and Taynton
quarries. Local people proudly tell you
that stone was sent from Radcot for the
rebuilding of St.Paul's Cathedral. The 
bridges nolonger have any industrial   
importance but are renowned as a local 
beauty spot and a traffic hazard.
