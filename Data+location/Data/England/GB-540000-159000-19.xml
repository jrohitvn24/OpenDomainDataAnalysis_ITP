		<content> HORSE RIDING IN BIGGIN HILL           
                                       
       An important form of recreation 
 around Biggin Hill is horse riding and
 there are several riding stables.     
       Much of the good quality        
 farmland is given over to pasturing   
 of the horses for riding rather than  
 cattle and sheep.  Horse riding is a  
 rapidly growing sport for local       
 residents and for people travelling   
 into the countryside from London.  In 
 some areas, the land is neglected and 
 there is a dustbowl of quagmire       
 depending on the season, thick clumps 
 of weeds and intricate fencing of     
 barbed wire and corrugated iron.      
 Around Biggin Hill there is a shortage
 of bridlepaths and so riders use      
 roads, footpaths and farmland and     
 there is conflict with other          
 countryside users.                    </content>
