		<title>03Places in Merebrow.</title>
		<content> In Merebrow there is a P.O. which is  
 owned by Mr. Sharples. Next door is   
 the Smithy owned by John and Sam Moss 
 who are brothers. It is an old        
 building where people bring broken but
 mendable metal things and they mend   
 them. Across the road is the Legh Arms
 quite a popular pub managed by Kenneth
 Morris. It has a big car park at the  
 side. Near the Legh Arms there is a   
 licensed restaurant called 'The Crab  
 and Lobster'. Behind the restaurant is
 a small engineering workshop.         
   Farther along the road is a Tea Shop
 which was once a bakery. Opposite     
 there is a National Westminster Bank, 
 which is open Mondays and Thursdays   
 only. On the corner of Marshes Lane is
 a shop, a warehouse and corn mill     
 belonging to the Ascroft family. Near 
 the shop there is a village Institute.
