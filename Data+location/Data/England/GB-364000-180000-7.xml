		<content> In 1931 the population of Winterbourne
 was 3,554. It has grown a great deal  
 since that time and in 1977 had       
 reached 10,330. There used to be an   
 old police station next door to the   
 Royal Oak public house but this was   
 demolished in 1959 to make way for a  
 road widening scheme. The nearest     
 police station today is about 5       
 kilometres away. The railway station  
 was closed in 1964 and people had to  
 find alternative means of transport   
 until the opening of Parkway Station  
 in 1972. From the 1920s St. Michael's 
 was the only school in the village    
 until the Ridings High School opened  
 in 1957. This became a comprehensive  
 in 1969. Our school, Elm Park, opened 
 in 1960. There has been a library in  
 the area for the last 18 years. Like  
 many villages Winterbourne has changed
 a lot over the years.                 </content>
