		<title>18A child's day,Coton Village</title>
		<content>Life in Coton is quiet and peaceful.The
weekdays are busy when we get ready for
school and feed our 3 pet cats,rabbit &amp;
guinea pig.My 2 sisters and I have to  
be driven 2 miles to school by 8.55am. 
We are all home by 4pm.After school I  
watch television,play outside on the   
swing,play tennis or ride my bike.I    
have to do homework after tea.At week- 
ends I clean out the pets and tidy my  
room.I sometimes go into Northampton to
spend my pocket money.When I have a    
friend to play we go to a secret place 
where we've built a seesaw.My sisters  
like to make camps and play in them.In 
winter we play squash a lot at East    
Haddon.From my bedroom I can see birds,
rabbits,cows and sometimes a fox.I have
a small garden to grow flowers and lett
-uce,and I've made a pool for the frogs
to use.Although it is quiet and there  
are no other children I like Coton.    </content>
