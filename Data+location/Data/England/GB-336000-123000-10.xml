		<title>10My Village, Fivehead</title>
		<content> The year is 1985. My name is Stuart   
 Neil McHardy and I am 9 years old. I  
 live in the village of Fivehead in    
 Somerset. I live with my mum and my   
 dad and my brother aged 11. We live in
 a detached house. We have a garden and
 a field, altogether we own two acres  
 of land. In the village there is one  
 shop which is also the Post Office.   
 There is a playing field with swings, 
 a climbing frame and a slide.  Thee is
 also a tennis court.                  
 Once a year we have a 'Fun Day' when  
 all the village play games and dress  
 up in Fancy Dress. First of all there 
 is a procession.  The band is in front
 then there are majorettes and then    
 there is the Fancy Dress Parade. There
 are some Show Tents and an 'It's a    
 Knockout' competition. At 8.00 pm     
 there is a Barn Dance which finishes  
 at midnight. I like it in Fivehead.   </content>
