		<title>04Housing in Eccleshall</title>
		<content> A few long established large, private 
 residences on the periphery of the    
 town, e.g. Eccleshall Castle, dominate
 this rural area which comprises old   
 traditional agricultural housing with 
 many old cottages recently developed  
 into larger properties mainly for     
 commuters.{Town housing}consisting of 
 a relatively small village-sized core 
 of older properties and two modern 3  
 storey blocks of purpose-built flats, 
 is surrounded on two sides by several 
 developments of small to medium family
 houses. Major modern town enlargement 
 which has evolved over the last twenty
 years has come to a virtual standstill
 owing to local pressure from the      
{District Plan}produced in the 1970s.
