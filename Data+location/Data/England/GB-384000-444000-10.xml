		<title>10TRANSPORT IN BARNOLDSWICK</title>
		<content> A long time ago there used to be a    
railway that went through Barnoldswick 
from Colne to Skipton. It was closed   
down in September 1965. The station was
knocked down and now it is a car park  
and part of the line is a playground.  
We also have a canal running through   
Barnoldswick but we only use that for  
pleasure rides. Last week a barge set  
on fire and the fire brigade had to go 
to it. We are now only served by       
Municipal buses.                       
 My dad has a sports car and I like it.
He has to go a long way to work and he 
comes home at the weekend in his car.
