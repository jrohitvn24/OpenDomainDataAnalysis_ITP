		<title>06ROUND  HOUSE</title>
		<content> The Round House stands alone in the   
 countryside ,so tucked away that most 
 people do not know it is still        
 standing,  it is the last survivor    
 of it's kind in the Midlands. It was  
 built as the Incline Keeper's house on
 the Leicester Swannington Railway     
 which was the second Railway built in 
 the world.                            
 The slope of the Bagworth Incline was 
 1:29, running downhill to Thornton.The
 coal travelled downhill towards       
 Leicester, so the weight of the coal  
 in the wagons pulled the empty wagons 
 up. The first train ran in 1832.      
 The Round House was built in an ideal 
 spot as the Keeper had fine views of  
 the Railway line. Today it is the     
 victim of constant vandalism.
