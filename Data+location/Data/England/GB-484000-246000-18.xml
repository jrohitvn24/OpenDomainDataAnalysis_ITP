		<content>ATTENDANCE AT ALL CHURCHES IS LOW e.g. 
A TYPICAL CONGREGATION AT TYRINGHAM    
CHURCH IS 5.THIS CHURCH SERVES BOTH    
FILGRAVE AND TYRINGHAM AND SHARES ITS  
RECTOR WITH HAVERSHAM.IT IS LIKELY THAT
THIS CHURCH WILL SOON BE DECLARED      
REDUNDANT AND THERE IS A VIGOROUS LOCAL
CAMPAIGN TO KEEP IT IN USE AS A        
BUILDING RATHER THAN A C.of E.CHURCH.  
GAYHURST CHURCH ALSO HAS A VERY SMALL  
REGULAR CONGREGATION AND SHARES ITS    
VICAR WITH STOKE GOLDINGTON AND        
RAVENSTONE.SOME GO OUT OF THE AREA TO  
WORSHIP:TO ROMAN CATHOLIC OR UNITED    
REFORM CHURCHES IN NEWPORT PAGNELL OR  
TO OTHER ANGLICAN CHURCHES AT LATHBURY 
OR SHERINGTON.BOTH PARISHES BELONG TO  
THE DIOCESE OF OXFORD AND THE RURAL    
DEAN IS THE VICAR IN NEWPORT PAGNELL.  
BOTH CHURCHES ARE IN DESPERATE NEED OF 
FUNDS BUT HAVE REGULAR FLOWER AND      
CLEANING ROTAS.                        </content>
