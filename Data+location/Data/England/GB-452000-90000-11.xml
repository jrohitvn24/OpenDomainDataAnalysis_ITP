		<title>11AN OLD PERSON IN WOOTTON</title>
		<content>  An old age pensioner told us: I      
 enjoy residing in Wootton because     
 the country is nice and quiet,an ideal
 place for retirement.The roads could  
 be improved and there could be a few  
 more pavements because the  roads are 
 very dangerous to walk along.Also some
 more bus shelters and some street     
 lights could improve things.          
  The people are very friendly in      
 Wootton.The road is very untidy in the
 summer, strewn with holidaymakers     
 litter.There is a mobile library which
 visits weekly that the older          
 population can use.There is           
 very little vandalism in Wootton      
 and the young are well behaved        
 generally.There is a 50 plus club for 
 the local community,and there is also 
 a youth club at Lakeside Holiday Camp.
