		<title>11OUR FOOD</title>
		<content>  We eat all sorts of food like French,
Italian and Chinese.Hamburgers and     
chips are junk food from a take-away   
shop.                                  
  For breakfast I have cereal which    
consists of wheat,barley,oats,maize and
rye.Then I have toast and marmalade.   
  For lunch I have beans or chese on   
toast or maybe I would have sandwiches.
I might have chocolate or cake.        
  For dinner I might have meat with    
potatoes and vegetables,or I might     
have fish.For pudding I could have     
tinned fruit or a pie.                 
  People usually eat these things.     
  At Christmas people have a tradition 
of turkey,roast potatoes and christmas 
pudding,plums and sweets.              
  On your birthday you can have a cake,
sausages on sticks,crisps and things   
like that.
