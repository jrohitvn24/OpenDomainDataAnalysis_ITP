 there have been a number of low-flying
 RAF jet fighters over the area on     
 training flights,making an enormous   
 and rather frightening noise.         
    We have about one third of a mile  
 of the Stafford to Crewe railway line 
 running through the south-west corner 
 of this area ,but there no stops      
 actually in it.However the four       
 electrified tracks carry a heavy      
 load,with trains at times passing     
 every two or three minutes.There is no
 east to west service locally.Ajourney 
 to London,135 miles away ,takes about 
 an hour and three quarters today.     
    The two hundred-year old           
 Trent-Mersey canal runs just outside  
 the area and is today much used by    
 holiday makers in the summer months.  </content>
