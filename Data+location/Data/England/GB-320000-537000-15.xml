		<title>15VILLAGE HISTORY</title>
		<content> The earliest historical records of the
 existence of Ireby is in the Pipe Roll
 of 1185 spelt YREBI. The spelling     
 changed through the years but would   
 appear to be of Norse origin, meaning 
 "the farmstead of the Irish man"- Byr 
 meaning farmstead and YRR or IRA      
 meaning Irish. For many years the     
 village has been divided into the two 
 manors of High and Low Ireby. Low     
 Ireby, the larger part of the present 
 village, was originally a clearing in 
 the forest of Westward. Ireby's       
 history as a market dates back many   
 centuries to the year 1237. The market
 cross standing opposite the school    
 gate was erected in 1275. Thursday was
 Ireby market day and a Fair lasting 3 
 days was held twice a year on Feb.24th
 and Sept.21st. In 1578 the success of 
 Ireby market was threatening to       
 impoverish Cockermouth's rival market.</content>
