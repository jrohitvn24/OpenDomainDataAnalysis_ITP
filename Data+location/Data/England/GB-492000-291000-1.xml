		<content>The Deene and Deenethorpe district is  
situated in gently undulating country- 
side in NE Northamptonshire, an area   
once covered by the vast Rockingham    
Forest. The development of this rural  
area has been strongly influenced by   
the Brudenell family who have owned    
much of the land since the 16th        
century.                               
In a calm and peaceful atmosphere,     
agriculture-both arable and grazing-   
provide the major land usage. There are
also conifer plantations, disguising   
redundant iron-ore quarries, a golf    
course, and a working quarry in the SE 
of the study area.                     
The district is notable for its large  
country houses-Deene Hall and Kirby    
Hall, both open to the public.         
The local stone villages of Deene and  
Deenethorpe have declined in size and  
population in recent years.            </content>
