 The only school in the area is the    
 Primary school in Hopton Wafers.      
 Children between four and a half to   
 eleven attend this school. At the     
 moment there is thirty seven on roll. 
 The secondary school is at Cleobury.  
 Children from eleven to sixteen attend
 this school. There is over six hundred
 children on roll. If the teenagers    
 want further education they either go 
 to the sixth form college in Ludlow , 
 or the college in Bridgnorth.         
  The primary school at Cleeton closed 
 in 1976 owing to falling numbers and  
 the children were transferred to      
 Farlow school.
