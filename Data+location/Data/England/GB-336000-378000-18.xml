		<content>      Although the railway line in     
 Hooton and Eastham does not pass      
 through our area,the people of Eastham
 use it to commute to either Chester in
 one direction or Liverpool in the     
 other.This is because the railway line
 in Hooton and Eastham runs from       
 Chester to Rock Ferry to Birkenhead,  
 Liverpool and further north.          
      Between Birkenhead and Liverpool,
 the railway goes underground,running  
 beneath the River Mersey.             
      This section of railway line in  
 our area is in the process of being   
 electrified and we had a school visit 
 from the{British Rail Transport Police
 who showed us a film and told us about
 the dangers of playing near railway   
 lines.
