		<content>   At the week-end the children and my 
 husband are at home as ther is no     
 school and most offices are shut. We  
 sometimes go swimming on Saturday     
 morning and then come home and do     
 various jobs around the house or      
 garden to try to keep our property    
 looking reasonable. In the Summer this
 includes weeding the flower beds,     
 cutting the grass,stacking the wood   
 which we have delivered for the winter
 painting the outside of the house,    
 cleaning the windows and any other    
 jobs which may need doing.            
   Once a fortnight we have a service  
 in our village Church.My husband is a 
 churchwarden and we all attend the    
 service which is held at 9.00a.m.This 
 is a Holy Communion Service. Every    
 Sunday the children attend Sunday     
 School at the shared church in        
 Hamstreet.                            </content>
