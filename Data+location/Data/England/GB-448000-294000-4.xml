		<content> The area of the survey is mostly      
 agricultural land. The air is usually 
 very clean though from time to time   
 there is a white dust in the air.There
 is also often the sound of blasting   
 in the air.The village of Croft also  
 has a large number of trucks passing  
 through it.All these particular things
 happen because of the quarry in       
 Croft.The river Soar passes through   
 Croft so too do many streams.From time
 to time there is flooding especially  
 in the winter.This may the reason why 
 there is more pasture land in the     
 south of the area.The M69 motorway has
 taken much of the traffic that once   
 used the Fosse Way.This has made the  
 farms beside the motorway very        
 noisy.There ios very little woodland  
 in the area .However there is some    
 dividing the fields,beside the railway
 ,but mostly beside the streams .      </content>
