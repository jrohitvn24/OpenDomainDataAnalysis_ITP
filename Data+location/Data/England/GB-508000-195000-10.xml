		<title>10Watford: The Canal</title>
		<content> During the heyday of canal systems the
{Grand Junction}Canal was built and ran
 through Watford. Later it became      
 combined with the Union canal, and so 
 became the{Grand Union Canal}that we  
 know today.                           
                                       
 In the past it was a major transport  
 system, but the advent first of the   
 railway (qv) and then of road         
 transport quickly sealed its fate.    
                                       
 In Watford the canal did not fall     
 derelict and today provides a major   
 leisure amenity for local people      
 (privately run evening cruises) and   
 strangers (several holiday firms hire 
 out cut down narrow boats) who use it 
 as a route through the town both North
 and South.
