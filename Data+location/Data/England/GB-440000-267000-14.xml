		<content>{Tig Shadow.}A game we like to play is 
 one that is only for  a sunny day.The 
 person who is "it" has to jump on the 
 shadows of all the other children.When
 they are all out we choose another    
 person to be "it".{Spider and Fly.}We 
 play this on the school climbing      
 frame.The spider has to swing around  
 the outside of the frame making an    
 imaginary web.As he makes the web he  
 has to touch each of the others  and  
 they are caught in the web.The game is
 over when all the children have been  
 caught.{Children's Customs.}When we   
 want to come out of a game for a short
 time to do something we cross our     
 fingers and use the word "nigses".This
 means no_one can get us until we      
 uncross our fingers.{Good Luck,Bad    
{Luck.}For good luck we catch a leaf   
 when it is falling.We have bad luck if
 we open crisp packets upside down.    </content>
