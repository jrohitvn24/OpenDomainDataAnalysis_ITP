		<title>18ST.THOMAS,A CITY VILLAGE.</title>
		<content> St.Thomas is a suburb of Exeter,and   
 used to be a village outside Exeter;  
 and is divided by the river into two  
 separate communities.Our area has its 
 own shopping centre and most ameneties
 Many of the houses are small Victorian
 terrace houses.Newer houses have been 
 built in some of the gardens of larger
 houses,so the architecture is varied. 
 The people who live here follow a     
 variety of occupations like plumbers, 
 taxi-drivers,roofers,electricians,and 
 civil servants.St.Thomas is an area   
 with many small commercial concerns as
 well as a residential area.We found a 
 large number of hair dressers,and many
 small garages specialising in         
 different aspects of motor repair.
