		<content>   Guides started in {1910}.           
  I go to Guides in {Ardleigh}.It is   
 very interesting.We all go on {WEEK}  
 camps to different places.            
                On camp we all have    
 turns to do things.We collect {Water }
 and {Wood}.And if you {cook} you {MUST
 get up at 7.00 in the morning.        
                We also go on {Nature  
{Trails}and have picnics half way      
 through.                              
                On camp each night we  
 have a {Midnight Feast.}Mrs.Swinscoe  
 knows, so the next morning we have to 
 work extra hard.                      
                In Guides you can      
 become a {Patrol Leader}or a{Seconder 
 If you are a Patrol Leader you have to
 wear a badge with one line of white on
 it.You then lead a group.
