 HAYWARDS HEATH IS RAPIDLY CHANGING,   
 MORE PLANNING PERMISSION IS BEING     
 GIVEN AND NICE OPEN GRASSLANDS AND    
 WOODS MAY SOON BE HOUSES.THIS SEEMS TO
 BE HAPPENING IN THE AREA TO THE       
 NORTHWEST OF THE JUNCTION OF LEWES    
 ROAD AND SNOWDROP LANE.               
 I THINK THAT THIS WOULD BE A SHAME AS 
 THAT AREA IS NICE AND QUIET AND HAS   
 LOTS OF WILDLIFE LIKE GREY SQUIRRELS, 
 PHEASANTS, RABBITS AND OTHER ANIMALS. 
   IN A FEW YEARS TIME THERE MAY BE    
 HOUSES ON LYOTH COMMON ASTHERE ARE    
 PLANS TO BUILD ON IT.NEAR LYOTH LANE  
 THERE WAS A NURSERY WHICH IS NOW A ROW
 OF HOUSES. THE NURSERY WAS CALLED     
 ORCHID NURSERY AND THE ROAD WHERE THR 
 NURSERY WAS IS NAMED AFTER IT.
