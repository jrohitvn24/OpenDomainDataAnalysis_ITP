		<content> Although the{population}is small      
 - the total in the 12 square          
 kilometres surveyed being estimated at
 less than five hundred - it is        
 very mixed. Some people have been in  
 the area all their lives; indeed one  
 elderly lady was past her ninetieth   
 birthday. Because the area is very    
 popular for{retirement}some members of
 the older generation are newcomers    
 seeking peace and quiet. Other recent 
 arrivals are much younger, following a
 trend of setting up house in the      
 countryside to raise a family.        
 In Pant-glas there are about forty    
 people, some of retirement age, others
 new-comers. Typical are two{families} 
 each which has two children who attend
{school}in Selattyn. Rhyd-y-croesau's  
 populace includes a retired clergyman.
