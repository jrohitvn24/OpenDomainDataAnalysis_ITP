 A newspaper article of January 1956   
states that the grammar school is the  
smallest in England with only eight    
pupils; sixty years previously it had  
80. The school closed in 1957.         
                                       
 Ravensworth Castle, just down the hill
is mentioned in Domesday Book, Kirby   
Hill is not mentioned but as the priest
was provided by the castle it may have 
been in exsistence by the time of the  
Domesday survey or soon afterwards.    
                                       
In 1811 the population was 131, in 1821
it was 161, in 1985 it was 61.
