		<title>09WIGAN HOSPICE</title>
		<content>  Wigan Hospice was founded in October 
 1981 by Doctor Surman who realised    
 there was a need for one in Wigan. The
 hospice is a large house that has been
 extended and converted. The wards open
 onto a green landscape with a view    
 over Scotman's Flash. The first       
 patients were admitted in September   
 1983 and the hospice was officially   
 opened by the Mayoress of Suffolk in  
 1984. It is run by a matron, twenty   
 qualified nurses, three home care     
 nurses and many volunteers. The money 
 for the hospice was raised by{public  
{donations.}It has ten beds, five      
 funded by Wigan Area Health Authority 
 and five funded by public donations.  
 Only the terminally ill go into the   
 hospice but on two days a week old    
 people go for a meal, a bath and an   
 afternoon out.
