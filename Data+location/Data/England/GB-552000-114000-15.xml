		<content> We went onto the grass near my house  
 and we made a list of how many cars   
 went towards Uckfield and how many to 
 Eastbourne. It was a bit hard when    
 there were cars coming both ways. In a
 quarter of an hour we counted         
             112 to EASTBOURNE         
             116 to UCKFIELD           
  12 lorries     4 dormobiles  1 bus   
   1 fire engine 1 bus         8 vans  
 199 cars        3 coaches             
 Sometimes we got confused because the 
 cars whizzed by. We had to sit well   
 back ehind the drain and I was glad   
 because I don't like the road.        
 Sometimes you have to wait a very long
 time before you can cross. We have a  
 traffic lady to help us over to       
 school. Sometimes it is Tom's mum.    
 They're going to build a new road so  
 the cars won't have to come through   
 our village.                          </content>
