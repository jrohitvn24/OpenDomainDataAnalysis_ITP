		<title>16LILLESHALL OLD HALL</title>
		<content> Lilleshall Old Hall once belonging to 
 the Leveson Gower family (the 1st.    
 Duke of Sutherland) is now an old     
 peoples' home belonging to 'Old Ben'  
 an organisation set up to look after  
 retired employees of the newspaper    
 industry who can no longer support    
 themselves. Until 1983 part of the    
 building was leased to Shropshire     
 County Council to house part of       
 Lilleshall Primary School. In 1983 a  
 new school building was provided      
 elsewhere and the building has now    
 become part of the old peoples' home. 
 In the grounds of The Old Hall is a   
 large pond stocked privately by local 
 fisherman for sport - mainly trout    
 fishing.
