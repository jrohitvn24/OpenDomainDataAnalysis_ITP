		<title>20FOX HUNTING IN COUNTESTHORPE</title>
		<content> Fox Hunting is a Countesthorpe        
 tradition that has been going on for  
 many years.Over a hundred people      
 on their horses and twenty five dogs  
 trample around the areas countryside, 
 in the four winter months and         
 sometimes in the summer.You can       
 sometimes hear the sound of a bugle   
 echoing over the fields during the day
 long hunt.                            
      For over fifty years, Jack Clark 
 a well known local farmer, had been   
 running the Fernie Hunt until he sadly
 died last year.                       
      In many of the fields the hedges 
 have been trimmed down to provide a   
 jumping place for the horses.         
      After a small survey had been    
 conducted we found out that the       
 majority of people were against the   
 sport.
