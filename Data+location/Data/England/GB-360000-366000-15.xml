		<content>{THE MAYOR OF WINSFORD.                
 David Tomlinson,is the Mayor of       
 Winsford and the Ancient Borough of   
 Over.Few mayors have two titles.There 
 are two mayoral maces in Winsford. Mr 
 Tomlinson is 35 years old. He has been
 in local government for 1 year.He owns
 a shop called Tiles and Carpets on    
 Over Square.                          
  He said 20% of the people in Winsford
 are unemployed, and there is little   
 chance of new jobs being created      
 locally in the future. Most of the    
 families on the Grange Estate work out
 side the area. He went on to say that 
 vandalism of local property was a     
 serious problem. Litter is also a     
 problem. Every piece of litter        
 collected costs the council 1p.       
  A keep Winsford Tidy campaign will be
 started in autumn 1985 to educate the 
 public on keeping the area tidy.      </content>
