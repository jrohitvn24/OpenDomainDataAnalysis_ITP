		<title>09PRIDDY POOLS</title>
		<content> There are a number of disused wash    
 pools which were used in connection   
 with the lead mining industry in this 
 area. Today they are known as Priddy  
 Pools.                                
 The pools now attract anglers. The    
 most common fish to be found are carp,
 rudd and perch.                       
 In very cold winters the pools freeze 
 over and local people go skating on   
 them. Although they are no deeper than
 five feet, skating is not encouraged  
 because there is always the danger of 
 someone falling through the ice.      
 The ponds also play host to a wide    
 variety of insect life. The most      
 spectacular being the Dragonflies.    
 The Pools are very popular with local 
 people as a place to walk or have     
 pic-nics.
