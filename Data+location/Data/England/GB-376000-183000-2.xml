		<content>   Horton School is a small rural      
 voluntary aided church school.It was  
 built about 1860 and brought up to    
 modern standards in 1982 with the     
 addition of a new classroom and toilet
 block.Much of this was done by the    
 voluntary help of parents and         
 friends,who also donated a substantial
 part of the cost.In spite of this the 
 school has been scheduled by the      
 County of Avon Education Committee to 
 close in July 1986.We are currently   
 contesting this and an appeal has been
 sent to the Secretary of State for    
 Education.The school plays an         
 important part in village life and    
 provides a Christian Primary Education
 for children of a scattered area      
 around Horton and Little Sodbury.     
 Parents are anxious that small        
 children shall not have a long journey
 by bus out of their environment.      </content>
