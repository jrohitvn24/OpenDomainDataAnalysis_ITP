		<content>    Demand has increased and there are 
 now packing depots in Littleport,     
 Crowland and Ramsey. The firm has     
 offices in London and abroad. However 
 the old machinery is disappearing.    
 Potato packing is now done by         
{computerised machines.}Jobs have been 
 lost through{natural wastage.         
    Much of the produce is supplied to 
{supermarkets}such as Sainsburys. Their
 regulations are very strict. For      
 example, not only do carrots have to  
 be sorted according to size, but      
 workers must wear special coat and hat
 for{hygiene}reasons and measures have 
 to be taken to control pests. After   
 packing vegetables are in cold store. 
 Half of the firm's eighteen lorries   
 are{refrigerated.}Some supermarkets   
 do not accept produce if it has been  
 allowed to go over a certain          
 temperature.{                         </content>
