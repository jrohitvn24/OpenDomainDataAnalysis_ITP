		<title>12QUILTING GROUP</title>
		<content>   Once the Quarry Centre had become   
established, a Quilting Group was      
started, working on alternate Thursday 
mornings in the Centre.                
   This group of ladies make hand-sewn 
patchwork quilts, to their own designs,
which are raffled for charities.       
   In 1984 nearly 300 pounds was raised
for the 'Old Folks' Club', which meets 
every Wednesday afternoon, in          
Goudhurst. This money ensures that the 
cost of the coach, which takes Kilndown
members to the club, will be met.      
   Another quilt was finished at the   
end of 1984 for the School P.T.A.. The 
raffle was drawn on Friday, 3rd. May,  
1985, after a talk on local history by 
Gordon Batchelor, in the Globe &amp;       
Rainbow. Betty, Gordon's wife, won the 
quilt. 190 pounds was raised to assist 
with the school swimming lessons.      
   Other quilts are now being made.    </content>
