		<content> Saint Mary's Church stands overlooking
 Ilkeston Market Place.  It was        
 originally built about 1150 A.D., and 
 at this time it was quite a small     
 building.  This was then added to in  
 13th, 14th, 18th and 19th centuries,  
 resulting in the present church       
 building as it stands today.  During  
 its life, sections of the church have 
 crumbled away, which meant that money 
 has had to be collected and donated to
 restore it during the last two        
 centuries.  During its existence, the 
 church has been under the control of  
 three different Diocese.  These were  
 Lichfield, Southwell, and, lastly,    
 Derby from 1927.  The church has a    
 tower which in it has a clock and     
 eight bells.  The church has an organ 
 which is reputed to have been played  
 by the Composer, Mendelssohn
