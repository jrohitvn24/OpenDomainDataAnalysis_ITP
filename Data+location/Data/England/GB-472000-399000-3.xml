		<title>03THE FARM SHOP, WESTWOODSIDE</title>
		<content>                                       
    There is a{farmshop}in Westwoodside
 on Commonside. It has been running for
 three years. It sells fruit and       
 vegetables. The farmshop and vegetable
 store are in some old farm buildings. 
    The owners do no1t grow much fruit 
 but they grow a lot of salad crops and
 vegetables. Some of the most popular  
 things out of all the food are greens 
 and in summer it is lettuce, radish   
 and spring onion. They serve about 150
 people a week.                        
    They try to cover most of the year 
 growing vegetables but sometimes they 
 have to buy from France or Holland.   
    They don't use heat to grow their  
 early seedlings but use a cold frame  
 which they find is adequate.
