		<title>04ST. PETERS CHURCH,BIRCH</title>
		<content>  The present church of St.Peters was  
 built by Charles Gray Round of Birch  
 Hall in 1849 on the site of Great     
 Birch Church which was demolished. It 
 is{built of stone and flint}with a    
 tile roof. The elegant stone{spire    
 rises 40m.above the village and is a  
 local{landmark.                       
  Unfortunately the stonework is       
 crumbling and the tile roof needs     
 urgent repair. The estimated cost for 
 repair is 125,000 pounds. During the  
 last months the Parochial Church      
 Council and local people have been    
 discussing its future and an appeal   
 fund has been launched to{restore}it. 
  The Rector, the Rev. H. Giddings is  
 also in charge of the churches of     
 Layer Breton and Layer Marney.
