		<title>06'I AM A TYNEMOUTH MONK</title>
		<content>{The imaginary life style of a monk.}  
 I have to wake up at 2 am when the    
 bell rings and go downstairs to sing  
 Matins. We have to learn the songs off
 by heart because it is still too dark 
 to see. In winter we then go back to  
 bed but in summer we walk to and fro  
 in the Cloisters for about an hour.   
 Then we go back into the church for   
 more prayers and for the rest of the  
 morning we go about our work. I       
 usually work in the garden. Then back 
 to church for Mass and then we go into
 the dining room to break our fast with
 dinner. After dinner we go back to    
 work. At about 4 pm it is back to     
 church for Evensong followed by a     
 light meal of bread and ale. We are   
 not allowed to talk while we are      
 eating. After the last service in the 
 church we go to bed and begin the     
 Great Silence.    {Michael aged 10 }  </content>
