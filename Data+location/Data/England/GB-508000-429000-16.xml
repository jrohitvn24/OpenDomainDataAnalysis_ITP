		<title>16HULL:PATTERNS OF EMPLOYMENT</title>
		<content>      For many years fishing lay at the
 heart of employment in Hull, with many
 families employed directly as         
 fishermen or indirectly in fishing    
 related industries.   This is no      
 longer the case.   Only 1% of children
 in our school had a parent involved in
 fishing.   Another 1% had fathers who 
 worked at sea - usually connected with
 the off-shore oil industry.           
      Much of the heavy engineering in 
 the city has also disappeared.   Only 
 5% of children had a parent involved  
 in one of the skilled trades.   Most  
 full-time employment amongst fathers  
 was connected with service industries.
 As many as 12% had a father who drove 
 a vehicle - lorries, buses etc.       
      Part-time work amongst mothers   
 was most often directed towards       
 cleaning, home-helps, dinner ladies   
 etc.                                  </content>
