		<title>05Giant's Caves : Banbury</title>
		<content>Giant's Caves is a {country park}. It  
is on the Broughton Road leading out of
Banbury. There is not a cave there it  
has been filled in, but it is a {picnic
area}. It is a kind of leisure park.   
It is a bumpy bit of land. You couldn't
grow crops on it or use it as          
grassland. You could use it as rough   
grazing land. But {Banbury} think it is
better to be a public park. The cave   
is a very exciting place to be in.     
Giant's Cave is by the village of North
Newington. Giant's Caves is a big      
place of about one acre. It has a place
for childen to make camps.
