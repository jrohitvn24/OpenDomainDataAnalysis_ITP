		<title>04HORSFORTH POLICE STATION</title>
		<content>      Our Community Policeman for      
 Horsforth showed us round the police  
 station.  There are over 100 officers 
 working there on three shifts. We     
 looked round the station and at some  
 of the transport used.  They have 3   
 Panda cars, 3 Patrol cars and 3 motor 
 bikes. There are also C.I.D. cars for 
 use by the Criminal Investigation     
 Department.                           
      Patrol cars are used at the scene
 of an accident.  The boot contains a  
 lamp, a slow sign, a first aid kit, a 
 fire extinguisher, a torch, a tape    
 measure and a bullet proof clip board.
 The officer also carries a            
 breatherliser and a personal radio.   
      Communications are very important
 to the police and cars are in contact 
 with the station where they have      
 computer links to their Bradford H.Q. 
 and other sources of information.     </content>
