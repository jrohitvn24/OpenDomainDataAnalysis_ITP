		<content>{KINGMOOR INDUSTRY} Kingstown is       
 Carlisle's largest industrial         
 estate.The area originally developed  
 as an airfield which was used between 
 the 1930's-50's. The first firms moved
 in at the beginning of the 1960's.The 
 first purpose-built roads were        
 constructed &amp; sites offered in 1965 &amp; 
 by 1967 some 27 sites were developed. 
 The site was made even more convenient
 in the early 70's because of easy     
 access to the newly constucted M6     
 which was within quarter of a mile.By 
 1982 the estate had nearly reached its
 full capacity.Now there are nearly 100
 firms working on the estate.These     
 include Coca Cola, Marks &amp;            
 Spencer,Greenall Whitley &amp; many       
 others.
