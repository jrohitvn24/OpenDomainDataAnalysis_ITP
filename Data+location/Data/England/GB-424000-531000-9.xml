		<title>09A Typical Day-by a child.</title>
		<content> My favourite day is Friday. I get up, 
 wash, clean my teeth, put on my       
 clothes and shoes, and watch the video
 until I go to school at 8.40am. When I
 get there I play football until we go 
 into school at 9.00am.The first thing 
 we do is get marked into the register 
 and do an English lesson. Then we go  
 out to play. When we come back in we  
 do a maths lesson until 12. We have   
 our dinner and playtime and when we   
 come back in we do our Domesday       
 Project. We have another playtime and 
 then we do more work. At quarter to   
 four we go home. I play outside until 
 I have my dinner. I then play out     
 until 8.30pm. I come in, get my       
 pyjamas on and watch television until 
 I go to bed.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
