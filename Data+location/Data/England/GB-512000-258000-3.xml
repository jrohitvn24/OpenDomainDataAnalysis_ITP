		<title>03Green Lanes</title>
		<content> In this area several Green Lanes have 
 survived. These are ancient rights of 
 way which unlike other country lanes, 
 were never metalled and are now used  
 as footpaths and bridleways. Yelnow   
 Lane and Forty Foot Lane are two      
 examples imporant both from a         
 landscape and wildlife viewpoint.     
 Their value to both lies in their     
 natural character and relative        
 seclusion compared to the verges of an
 ordinary road, which they would be if 
 they had been surfaced. The Lanes are 
 of ancient origin and are rich in     
 variety of shrubs and trees and       
 associated fauna. From a 30 yards     
 section of hedge at Forty Foot Lane 11
 different species of shrubs and trees 
 were found. This confirms that this is
 an ancient boundary, as it can be     
 assumed 100 years of age for each     
 species found in a hedgerow.          </content>
