		<content>  We have four churches in our area of 
 March;two{Church of England}(St.John's
 and St.Mary's),one{Methodist}(Station 
 Road),and one{Roman Catholic}(Church  
 of our Lady of Good Counsel). Each    
 church has a reasonable congregation  
 each week. The Rector of{St.Mary's}has
 two churches to care for,so he cannot 
 do as many services at St.Mary's.     
  He came to tell us how he might spend
 a weekday.He begins early each morning
 by going to{church to pray.}Later he  
 has{telephone calls and letters}to    
 deal with.He has his{sermon to prepare
 for Sunday and he{visits sick people  
 either at home or in hospital.There   
 may also be{services during the week. 
  In the evening he may have{wedding   
{practices,baptism visits}to make or   
{confirmation classes}or{committee     
{meetings}to attend.
