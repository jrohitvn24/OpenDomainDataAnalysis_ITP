		<title>13DAIRY FARMING</title>
		<content> My dad is a dairy farmer. His name is 
 Peter Redstone. Every morning he gets 
 up at 5am, dresses and goes out to the
 milking parlour. He first makes sure  
 everything is ready. He takes the     
 clusters from the washup tub and fixes
 them to the milking machine. He goes  
 out to round up the cows. This takes  
 about ten minutes depending on which  
 field the cows are in. There are forty
 Jersey cows in the herd and they go   
 into the milking parlour six at a     
 time. It takes five to ten minutes to 
 milk six cows. When he has finished   
 milking everything has to be washed   
 and then put ready for the next       
 milking. The cows are milked twice    
 each day. After he has had his        
 breakfast he mucks out all the manure 
 from the calves pens. Sometimes he has
 to move the electric fences.
