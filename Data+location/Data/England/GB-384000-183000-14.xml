		<title>14CIDER MAKING, A NEW TRADE</title>
		<content>  The Sherston Earl Vineyard has been  
 in existence for about 10 years. they 
 grow white{grapes}for{wine, apples}for
{cider}and{strawberries.}The           
 strawberries are grown for the fruit  
 which is picked by customers , but    
 some are made into a kind of wine.    
  The{apples}are grown in the          
 traditional way although the stock    
 used is a smaller kind so that care of
 the bush like trees is made easier.The
 apples are allowed ripen naturally and
 to fall off the trees . They are then 
 gathered from off of the ground.A     
 typical crop at present is about 300  
 tons.The fruit is mechanically mashed 
 and the juice pressed out.It is then  
 allowed to ferment naturally in large 
 plastic containers previously used to 
 import orange juice.It is then aged in
 barrels previously used for rum or    
 sherry to gain flavour.               </content>
