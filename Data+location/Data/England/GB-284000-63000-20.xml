		<title>20The Pottery at Marldon</title>
		<content> In Marldon we have a{pottery}.They get
 quite a few customers.The manager has 
 been working there for seven years.He 
 has liked pottery all his life.He     
 employs 24 people.                    
 We asked if he liked the village.he   
 said"Yes".The pottery makes lots of   
 pots and they make the bases of       
 bedside lights.Before it was this     
 pottery the building was used by      
 another pottery firm which made gifts 
 for tourists.                         
 Before that it was a food shop owned  
 by the Paignton Cooperative           
 society,but it closed because local   
 people prefer to go to Paignton or    
 Torquay to buy their food in          
 supermarkets.                         
 Visitors from the holiday camps along 
 the Torquay ring road walk through    
 Marldon each week and visit the       
 pottery.                              </content>
