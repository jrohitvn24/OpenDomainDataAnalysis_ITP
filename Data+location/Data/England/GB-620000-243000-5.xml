   Grange Farm  is  one of the farms in
the Kesgrave  area.   The  farmer  owns
about  600  acres of land,  yet he only
employs 6 people. He has owned the farm
for only one year.   He  inherited  the
farm when his father died.             
   The farmer sprays his  crops to help
them grow as well as to kill pests  and
kill weeds. He once found a  5000  year
old sickle  in  his  fields  which came
from Northern England.   The  land  was
heathland originally and the farm  used
to be divided into  many  small  fields
but now the  farm  has only a few large
fields  although there may be more than
one crop  growing  in each.   The  main
crops are barley, oats, rye, sugar beet
and potatoes.
