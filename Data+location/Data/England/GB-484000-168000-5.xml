		<content>   {Park Farm}is owned by Luff Farming 
 Ltd,but it is managed by Mr Row,who   
 has only one other helper.It is{210   
{acres}of mixed farm.                  
 The farm breeds and rears beef cattle.
 They have one{Charolais}bull,which    
 weighs 1250 kg.There are 30 Charolais 
 calves and cows altogether.Each cow   
 eats a bale of hay a day and some     
 silage,which costs the farmer Â£100    
 weekly per cow.There are also quite a 
 lot of{Fresian}heifers.Fresians give  
 good milk and Charolais are good beef 
 cattle,so the farmer interbreeds them.
   Several fields are devoted to grass,
 for grazing,silage and hay.In the     
 remaining fields there is{winter      
{wheat,maize}and{tomatoes. }           
   The farm has three tractors one of  
 them is for backup.This farm is       
 typical of this area.
