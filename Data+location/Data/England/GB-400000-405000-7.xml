		<content> Two thirds of the area is high peat   
 bog &amp; rocky areas, so only the valley 
 sides &amp; floor are used for buildings. 
 Dispersed about the hillsides are     
 sturdy, stone-built farmhouses, former
 homes of farmer/weavers, dating from  
 17th &amp; 18th centuries, alongside large
 clothiers homesteads, often with long 
 lines of stone mullioned windows. Some
 show signs of enlargement to house the
 extra looms as trade expanded. Weavers
 cottages were grouped in clusters, eg.
 Saddleworth Fold, Shaws &amp; Holly Grove.
 Holly Grove House (1800) is a fine    
 example of a merchants house &amp; the    
 Cross Keys Inn (1745) has stone       
 mullioned windows &amp; hand-hewn beams.  
 Terraced housing on the valley floor  
 was built from 1850 onwards, made of  
 locally-quarried stone, for workers at
 the newly-built cotton &amp; woollen mills
 eg. Dobcross Loom Works (1860).       </content>
