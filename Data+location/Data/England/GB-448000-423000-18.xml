		<title>18THE KNOTTINGLEY-GOOLE CANAL</title>
		<content> A canal runs through Knottingley.The  
 canal was built in the early 19th     
 century to carry{coal}from the        
 Yorkshire coalfield for export. The   
 canal is still a busy commercial      
 waterway and coal is still the main   
 cargo,but coal is no longer exported, 
 it is now taken from the pits,to coal 
 burning{power stations}.A special type
 of barge is used to transport the     
 coal, called a{Ferrybridge Compartment
{Boat}, each holding 170 tons; up to{5 
 can be{pushed}at once,in all 850 tons.
   Another cargo  is{oil}and{petrol    
 brought from the refinery at Immingham
 to the depot at Leeds.                
  {Sand}which is used to make{glass},is
 still brought to Rockware glass works 
 by canal.The canal is being used more 
 for{leisure},by pleasure boats ,with  
 also a canalside walk and picnic area.
