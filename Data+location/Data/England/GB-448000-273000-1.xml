 THERE ARE ROWS OF TERRACED HOUSES,    
 SEMI-DETACHED HOUSES AND QUITE        
 A FEW DETACHED ONES.SOME ARE FAIRLY   
 LARGE WHILE OTHERS ARE QUITE SMALL.   
 JUST OUTSIDE THE CENTRE THERE IS AN   
 AREA OF CONCIL HOUSES,OVERSLADE       
 ESTATE.IT'S NICKNAME IS 'TINTOWN'.    
 THIS IS BECAUSE THE HOUSES' WALLS ARE 
 MADE OF TIN AND THE ROOFS ARE MADE    
 FROM CORRUGATED IRON.THE AGE OF HOUSES
 RANGE FROM GEORGIAN PERIOD HOUSES TO  
 NEWLY BUILT ONES.A LARGE NUMBER OF    
 PEOPLE LIVING IN RUGBY COMMUTE TO     
 LARGER TOWNS TO WORK.                 
   'TINTOWN'OR OVERSLADE ESTATE WAS    
 BUILT FOR HOMELESS PEOPLE DURING THE  
 WAR.WHEN THE WAR ENDED,THE PEOPLE     
 DIDN'T WANT TO MOVE.                  
   A NEW ESTATE CONTRASTING WITH       
 NEIGHBOURING 'TINTOWN' IS HIGHLANDS,  
 WITH SMALL,MODERN,PRIVATE HOUSING.    </content>
