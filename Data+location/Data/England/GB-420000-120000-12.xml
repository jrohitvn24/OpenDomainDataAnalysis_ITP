		<title>12Redlynch Child Activities</title>
		<content> Children are active in many organised 
 activities outside school.            
   Redlynch and Landford cub, scout,   
 brownie and guide groups are well     
 supported and some children ride in   
 the New Forest.Swimming is popular    
 both in one of two private pools      
 available and in Salisbury Public     
 Baths, where many awards in           
 proficiency are achieved.             
   In addition to recorders, children  
 play piano, organ, violin, trombone,  
 flute and clarinet and girls attend   
 classes in ballet, tap and modern     
 dancing. At present there are no      
 Redlynch pupils in the award winning  
 Woodfalls Band.                       
   Some children pursue handicraft     
 activities at the Methodist Church and
 some are members of the local keep fit
 group. More than half the pupils use  
 the Downton and/or mobile libraries.  </content>
