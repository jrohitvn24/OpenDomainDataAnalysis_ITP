		<title>10SPORTING SURVEY:3</title>
		<content> part of an organised group.  Most went
 for an organised group (some games    
 such as football prevent anything     
 else), but some preferred to play with
 just a best friend, and a very few    
 preferred to play alone.              
   Time also came into the survey when 
 we inquired into how much time they   
 devoted to sport.  Boys spend by far  
 the most amount of time each week     
 playing their favourite sport, often  
 several hours each day, with some     
 girls playing their favourite sport   
 just once a week.                     
    Eighty-eight percent preferred to  
 play rather than spectate a sport, but
 nine percent were equally willing to  
 do both.                              
    Overall, it was found that sport   
 plays an important part in the leisure
 time of many of our youngsters.
