		<title>11THE POST OFFICE SWANAGE</title>
		<content>     Swanage Post Office was opened in 
 1972 and was built where a garage used
 to stand. Before 1972 the Post Office 
 was in Station Road where Currys'     
 Electrical shop is now situated.      
   There are 16 postmen, 1 inspector   
 and 1 post master. If a 1st class     
 letter is posted between 5.45pm and   
 10.15am in Swanage, it is postmarked  
 by hand and delivered in the next     
 post. Mail arrives at the sorting     
 office from Bournemouth and Wareham.  
 The postman puts the mail into inward 
 frames which have the names of the    
 roads in Swanage. Then they are sorted
 into delivery frames which have the   
 numbers of the houses on them.        
   The postman starts to deliver at    
 about 7.00am. Each man has his own    
 route, on foot, on bicycle or by van. 
 There are two deliveries of mail six  
 days a week.                          </content>
