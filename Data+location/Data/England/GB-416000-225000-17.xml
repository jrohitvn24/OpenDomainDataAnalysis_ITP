		<title>17GAMES WE PLAY IN STOW</title>
		<content> At school we have two playgrounds,    
 one for boys and one for girls. In the
 girls' playground we play hopscotch   
 and some singing games. Some singing  
 games are played with a skipping rope.
 There are ball games as well, like    
 Cinderella Umberella, who has got the 
 ball? We play rounders, but there is  
 not much room as the boys have got the
 big playground.                       
  They play football and chasing games.
 In the summer we have races and       
 sometimes we all go in the big        
 playground to race.                   
  We have PE in the boy's playground   
 and in the winter we play netball with
 Mrs Robbins. The boys play football   
 down on the playing field. In the     
 summer we all go down to the field and
 we play rounders and the boys play    
 cricket.
