		<title>13FARMING  DARTMOOR</title>
		<content>      Some farmers use {Commoners'     
{rights}to graze cattle and sheep on   
 the moors. Theft is a problem. As far 
 back as {World War Two}there was a    
 successful conviction for stealing    
 animals from the moor.Animals now     
 suffer more injuries and deaths       
 because of increasing road traffic.   
     {Commoners}may only put animals on
 the moor within their parish. There   
 are regulations governing the numbers 
 allowed. This is not strictly enforced
 at the moment, so in a hard winter or 
 in times of drought there is not      
 enough food for the animals on the    
 moor. There is a Bill going through   
 Parliament at the moment which will   
 help enforce the law.                 
      Foxes are kept under control by  
 hunting.Badgers live on the moor and  
 there are deer in wooded areas. Mr.   
 Whitley's gamekeeper rears pheasants. </content>
