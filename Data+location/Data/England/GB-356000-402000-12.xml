		<content>"Six Bricks"                           
You have 6 bricks about a foot apart   
and a person called a flyer has to jump
over the bricks as far as she can, then
pick a brick and put it where she      
lands. If you touch a brick or can't   
jump the spaces, you are out.          
"Skilly"                               
One team runs off round the streets and
the other team has to catch you. Then  
the people on your team try to skilly  
you by touching the wall where you are 
being kept and shouting "Skilly all    
out" so you are not caught any more. If
all your team is caught, the other team
goes off and you have to catch them.   
"Kerby"                                
You have people across the road from   
each other. You have a try to hit the  
kerb with a ball for 1 point if it     
rolls back, 2 if it bounces and you    
catch it.                              </content>
