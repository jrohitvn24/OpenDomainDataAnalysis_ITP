		<content>    We go out to very special treats   
 about once a month and ordinary trips 
 about twice a week. We're all together
 except for Dad who does at least 10   
 hours of farming each day, but he's   
 off for about 3 hours on a Sunday. I  
 don't know what they  think about my  
 personality, but this is what I think 
 of theirs, my brother is a pest       
 because he always does what he's told 
 not to do, he jumps to conclusions, he
 shouts when he realises that I'm      
 reading, he even jumps on my bed in   
 the morning when I'm sleeping.My mum  
 is fine until my brother does the     
 twist and sends mum round the bend,   
 then I start getting blamed because I 
 have'nt taught him good manners, as if
 it was my fault! My dad is my         
 favourite person,he's good fun, good  
 tempered and rarely moody.
