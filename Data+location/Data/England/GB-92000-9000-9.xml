		<content>    Although there are few amenities in
 this area apart from one small outdoor
 heated swimming pool owned by a       
 private hotel but open to the public  
 the residents take advantage of the   
 facilities surrounding them. Many of  
 these concern the sea and include     
 angling,boating,sailing and swimming. 
 There is a sailing club for dinghies, 
 a yacht club and an underwater centre 
 (diving being a very popular pastime).
 Windsurfing is also very popular.     
 There is also a large following for   
 gig racing (the racing of six_oared   
 pilot gigs). Other facilities near by 
 include a 9 hole golf course,one      
 squash court and one tennis court.    
 Cricket,football and Hockey are also  
 played.There is a diffculty in finding
 different competition and most events 
 depend on the residents competing     
 against each other.                   </content>
