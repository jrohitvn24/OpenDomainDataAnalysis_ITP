		<title>08The Yew Tree,Wilmington</title>
		<content> In Wilmington church yard there is an 
 impressive Yew tree with a 23 foot    
 girth and two vast trunks. The tree is
 between 800 and 1000 years old and was
 probably alive at the time the        
 Domesday Book was written. Its age    
 means that it now has to be supported 
 by chains and old telegraph poles.    
 Despite being old it still bears fruit
 each year.                            
                                       
 Many reasons have been suggested for  
 the presence of the Yew Tree. Some say
 it discourages animals from wondering 
 in the churchyard while others think  
 it was to stop the growth of weeds    
 around the graves. It is possible that
 its branches were cut for use as long 
 bows,although we have no proof of     
 this.
