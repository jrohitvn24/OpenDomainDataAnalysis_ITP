		<title>07Gt.Yeldham Go kart Club</title>
		<content> In 1981 a man called Mr.Doug Chapman  
 noticed a concrete piece of waste     
 ground behind the Gt.Yeldham football 
 pitch and thought it could be used as 
 a kart track. He had once raced go    
 karts so he wrote to the Council and  
 they agreed to his suggestion.He put  
 up notices proposing the formation of 
 a club with an annual subscription of 
 Â£10 to cover insurance.More people    
 soon joined and the racing became more
 enjoyable although there have been    
 complaints from local people about the
 noise.Adult members race 100cc karts  
 but children's karts are limited to 50
 cc engines .The karts are only about  
 2cms from the ground and they can     
 reach speeds of up to 60m.p.h. The    
 annual membership fee is now Â£20 per  
 family.
