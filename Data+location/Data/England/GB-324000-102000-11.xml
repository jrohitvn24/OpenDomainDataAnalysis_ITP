		<title>11MAYPOLE FETE</title>
		<content> The village fete, an event held       
 annually in May, takes place in the   
 grounds of Stockland Village Hall.    
 At the fete the local schoolchildren  
 participate in the age-old tradition  
 of{Maypole Dancing.}Each child holds a
 ribbon and rotates in a variety of    
 movements around the pole, producing  
 different patterns in the ribbons.    
 The dance itself was originally used  
 to welcome the warmth of summer, but  
 is now kept as a tradition.           
 Besides the dancing there are several 
 stalls where money can be lost or won.
 There is also a donkey derby where the
 children become jockeys and race      
 against each other. There is a tote   
 where bets are placed on these races.
