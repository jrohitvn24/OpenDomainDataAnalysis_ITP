		<title>19All Saints' Church</title>
		<content>   This stone-built church, with its   
 tall tower, stands at one end of the  
 main road. This area was once the     
 ancient parish of{Tatenhill}and the   
 church was the gift of{Michael Thomas 
{Bass M.P.,}the Burton brewer. It was  
 built in 1867 to the design of{William
{Butterfield.}Taylors of Loughborough  
 supplied the peal of five bells.      
   In 1884{Rangemore}became a parish   
 and the church was consecrated and    
 dedicated to All Saints'.             
   In 1885 the church was extended by  
{Michael Arthur Bass}who was the first 
 Baron Burton. This later work was     
 designed by{G.F.Bodley.}              
   There are many memorials to the Bass
 family within the church and its      
 patron is the present{Lord Burton.}   
   The rector, who lives in the nearby 
 vicarage, is also rector of           
 neighbouring{Tatenhill}and{Dunstall.} </content>
