		<title>02BURFIELD HALL FARM</title>
		<content> Mr Peter Phillip's father moved into  
 Burfield Hall farm about 1925. Now the
 farm is run by Peter Phillips and his 
 three brothers with their mother doing
 the accounts.                         
 It is a mixed arable farm of 214 acres
 and the crops grown are winter barley,
 wheat, sugar beet and beans for cattle
 feed. Stock kept are cows and calves. 
 The farm is about 300 years old and   
 the farm buildings 200-300 years old. 
 A haulage business is also run from   
 the farm. Of crops grown on the farm, 
 malting barley for beer is taken to   
 Tivetshall, wheat to Yarmouth for     
 export to Poland and sugar beet to    
 Bury St Edmunds. Cattle and Horses are
 also transported.
