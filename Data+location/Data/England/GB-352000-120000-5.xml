		<content>   My Dad is a{farmer}who keeps a herd 
 of the black and white{Friesian cows  
 for their milk. The cows come into the
{milking parlour}four at a time and    
 they are milked by machine. My Dad    
 usually finishes work about six       
 o'clock but when the cows are{calving 
 then he has to stay with them whatever
 the time.                             
   We have{two dogs}which help to bring
 the cows in for milking.They also work
 with{sheep}when my Dad has a few.     
   At the moment he is{haymaking.}The  
 hay has been cut and baled and now the
 tractors are going down to the fields 
 to bring the bales in.My Dad drives a 
 red and grey{Massey Fergusson tractor.
   After school I like to go down to   
 the hayfields and have a{picnic,      
 especially when the hay is being cut. 
 If I am lucky, I get a ride home on   
 the tractor!.                         </content>
