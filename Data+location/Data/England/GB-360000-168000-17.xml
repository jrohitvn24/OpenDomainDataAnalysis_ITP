		<title>17Elderly people's home (1)</title>
		<content> Many elderly people's homes are run by
{Avon County Council.}The people who   
 live in these homes are retired, too  
 old to live alone or handicapped in   
 some way.                             
 In one home that I know well there are
 between 54 and 60 people. They are    
 looked after by staff who work shifts,
 from 0700 hrs. to 1400 hrs. and 1400  
 hrs. to 2200 hrs. Clerical officers,  
 cooks, care assistants and domestic   
 workers are employed. In charge of the
 home is a Matron who is also a nurse. 
 Residents have their own rooms. They  
 are called around 0700 hrs. and many  
 have to be dressed by the staff.      
 Breakfast is at 0830 hrs. with a      
 different menu each day. After        
 breakfast residents make their way to 
 the lounge. Some might have their hair
 washed on Tuesday or Thursday and most
 bath each day.A helper shaves the men.</content>
