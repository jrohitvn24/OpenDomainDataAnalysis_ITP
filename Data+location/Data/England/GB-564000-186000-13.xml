		<title>13LOCAL THEATRE AND LAINDON</title>
		<content> The{Towngate Theatre}in Basildon      
 provides a variety of entertainment   
 for people who live in Laindon. There 
 are concerts, plays, pantomimes, opera
 and rock shows performed there. The   
 main theatre can hold four hundred    
 people and the small studio holds up  
 to seventy five people.               
 The{Towngate}provides special         
 facilities for the handicapped. For   
 people in wheelchairs there are ramps 
 so that they can manoeuvre their way  
 easily into the theatre. There are    
 also ten chairs reserved for          
 handicapped people. None of the London
 theatres provide such a good service. 
 For people who are hard of hearing,   
 there is a special hearing device.    
 The Towngate will be knocked down in  
 1989 and{Basildon Council}will build a
 new theatre. The new theatre will hold
 750 people.                           </content>
