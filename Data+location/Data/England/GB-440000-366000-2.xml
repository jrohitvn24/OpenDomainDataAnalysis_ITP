		<title>02WORKING AROUND GRASSMOOR.</title>
		<content> Most people from Grassmoor and Temple 
 Normanton work away from their homes, 
 usually 3 miles away in Chesterfield. 
 There are farms, garages and shops    
 providing employment but no factories 
 or industries                         
 There is widespread land reclamation  
 taking place but mainly construction  
 engineers and workmen from out of the 
 area are used.                        
 Servicing of machines is carried out  
 at Corbriggs and the N.C.B. has its   
 Area Workshops and Medical Centre at  
 the site of the old Williamthorpe     
 Colliery.                             
 In l985 a new road was built south of 
 the colliery to give access to land   
 set aside for an industrial estate. It
 is hoped that its proximity to the M1 
 Motorway will encourage firms to build
 there. So far no work has started and 
 unemployment in the area remains high.</content>
