		<title>13LIFE IN THE DALES (2)</title>
		<content> Life in the Yorkshire Dales in winter 
 is hard, with the wind moaning through
 the trees and howling round the house.
 Outside the land is covered with snow 
 and farmers have to struggle to find  
 their sheep in the drifts. Spring     
 sometimes still means snow, and hoping
 that the ewes can be got in before    
 lambing starts. Spring also means     
 green fields and lambs leaping and    
 playing. Summer is the smell of       
 freshly cut grass being dried in the  
 sun ready for haytime. It also means  
 the sound of people enjoying          
 themselves swimming in the river, or  
 walking, pack on back, along the      
 Pennine Way. Autumn is the time for   
 children to gather conkers, whilst the
 leaves turn orange, red and golden    
 brown. This is what I remember about  
 the place I live--the Yorkshire Dales.
