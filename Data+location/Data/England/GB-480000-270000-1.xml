		<content>The area covered by Walgrave County    
Primary School is approximately 10     
miles to the North East of             
Northampton.It is a rural area mostly  
given over to arable  crops.Lying on   
the Northamptonshire uplands it is the 
epitome of the rolling English         
Countryside.There are two villages,    
Walgrave and Hannington,  with about   
700 and 150 inhabitants respectively.  
Children of primary age go to the      
local school in Walgrave ,those of     
secondary age ,by and large, go to     
Moulton Comprehensive or Kettering.    
   Most people living in the village   
work  out of the area.The local        
employment consists of either farming  
or the belt factory in Walgrave.       
   Most of the homes are built of      
Northamptonshire Ironstone and roofed  
with tiles.Houses are continuing to be 
built in both villages.                </content>
