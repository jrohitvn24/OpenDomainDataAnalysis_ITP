		<content> People have lived in Holmes Chapel for
 hundreds of years but most of the     
 houses seen today belong to this      
 century.  We have a Queen Anne mansion
 called "The Hermitage", a timber      
 framed thatched cottage and several   
 Georgian farmhouses, e.g. "The        
 Orchards" but most of the older houses
 are found in the village centre.      
 These date from the 18th century and  
 many have been converted into shops.  
 There are few Victorian houses and so 
 the next development seems to be      
 inter_war semis which follow the main 
 roads.  Post war estates complete the 
 infill of land bounded by the railway 
 and the main roads.  The houses are   
 mainly semi_detached and detached.    
 Most recent development has taken     
 place between the village centre and  
 the motorway radically changing the   
 village.                              </content>
