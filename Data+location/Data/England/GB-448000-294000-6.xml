		<content> The most tragic news that has         
 happened in the area occured in       
 January of this year,1985.A boy from a
 nearby village,against good advice    
 went to the top of Croft hill with a  
 large plastic bag.The snow was well   
 compacted and allowed the boy to      
 travel at a fast speed towards Huncote
 village.This was known as a dangerous 
 route.The boy hit a trunk of a dead   
 tree and broke both his skull and his 
 neck.The boy died in hospital the same
 day.                                  
 The Leicester Coritanians,a local     
 athletic club,have decided to use once
 again Croft community centre for their
 annual roadrace.This proved such a    
 success last year that the club once  
 again wish to use the facilities.Many 
 people from Croft and Stoney Stanton  
 are expected to attend.There may well 
 be famous "names" present.            </content>
