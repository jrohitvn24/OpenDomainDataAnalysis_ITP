		<title>02BRIGHTLINGSEA CHURCH</title>
		<content> All Saints Church stands in the middle
 of an agricultural area and once held 
 regular weekly services.However,with  
 the local decline of agriculture,     
 Brightlingsea became a sea-faring     
 rather than a farming area and        
 community activities became centred on
 the coast.Consequently the church fell
 into comparative neglect,and now is   
 used only for special services.       
       In 1969 the fabric of the church
 was in such poor condition that its   
 permenant closure seemed inevitable.  
 However "The Friends of All Saints    
 Church" was founded and since then    
 have raised over Â£20,000.The fabric of
 All Saints has been saved from further
 decay and a start made on long-term   
 restoration.The Friends represent     
 everyone  in the local community and  
 beyond,who wants to see this beautiful
 old church restored.                  </content>
