		<content>     In my area there are lots of      
 facilities for sport .There are two   
 play areas one at The Good Shepherd   
 and one down Renda Road in Holbury.   
 On Friday I go to football training.In
 the Summer we train at the Manor.Our  
 team is called  Manor F.C.            
     There are several youth clubs at  
 Blackfield. Calshot and Lepe are      
 beaches nearby .At Calshot there are  
 two five_aside football pitches,four  
 badminton courts and a ski slope.Lepe 
 has got a coast_guard station,one cafe
 and an ice cream shop.There is also a 
 B.M.X. track which has got alot of    
 bumps and that gets a lot of wear .   
 Esso and I.S.R. have Judo clubs for   
 boys and girls. Esso Cinema was       
 changed into the Waterside Cinema     
 because people thought it was just for
 Esso workers.The Sea Scouts go to     
 Hythe for their meetings.             </content>
