		<title>13THE CHURCH-CAMELS' AREA</title>
		<content>  The church plays quite an important  
 part in the community, in that it     
 marries, christens and buries people  
 and provides help and comfort to many 
 who are in need. In this parish, the  
 congregation has diminished during the
 past 10 years, although special       
 services like Christmas and Easter are
 still crowded. The vicar has churches 
 at Queen Camel, Marston Magna and West
 Camel to look after. He visits the    
 school regularly and also the hospital
 in Yeovil.                            
  The churches at West Camel and Queen 
 Camel were built at about the same    
 time in the 14th century. They both   
 have very old rood screens which      
 divide the sacred part of the church  
 from the public part. The bells in    
 Queen Camel church weigh 5\ tons. The 
 wooden lectern base originated in     
 Holyroad House, Scotland.             </content>
