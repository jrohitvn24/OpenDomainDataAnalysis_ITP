		<title>10TRANSPORT IN CODICOTE/WELWYN</title>
		<content>  Easy access to the railway and the A1
 Motorway has made this area a         
 convenient and popular place for      
 commuters to live and have a          
 comparatively quick journey to London 
 or neighbouring towns.                
  The A1M northwards from Welwyn was   
 opened in July 1962 and ten years     
 later the southern stretch was        
 completed.                            
  The good bus services of the past    
 have now been severely cut due to the 
 growth of car ownership, many house-  
 holds having at least two cars.       
  There is a six day half-hourly bus   
 service from Hitchin to Potters Bar   
 via Welwyn and a bi-hourly seven day  
 Green Line between Hitchin and Reading
 via the B197. Codicote is served by   
 one bus from Welwyn Garden City to    
 Hitchin, Mon to Sat, and one from     
 Stevenage to Luton 3 days a week.     </content>
