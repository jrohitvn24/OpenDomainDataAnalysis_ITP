		<title>16LEISURE ACTIIVITIES</title>
		<content> I am finding out about{leisure        
{actiivities.}Most people like to watch
 television,especially in the winter,  
 and in this area we can receive       
 B.B.C.1 and 2 and B.B.C. East and     
 I.T.V. Thames,and Channel 4.All the   
 children like playing outside and I   
 like gardening. There are cub packs,  
 Brownies,Guides and Scouts but we have
 to go to the next village to meet.    
 There is a playing field in Ford End  
 with swings and goal posts and a      
 cricket field where the team plays at 
 weekends.People can fish in the rivers
 and reservoirs but you shoud have a   
 licence. There is a village hall in   
 Ford End where there are discos and   
 sometimes concerts. The pubs have dart
 teams and they have matches against   
 other teams.
