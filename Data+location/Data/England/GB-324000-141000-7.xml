		<title>07Farming in Pawlett Hams.</title>
		<content>      Pawlett Hams is a flat area of   
 farmland inside a "U" bend of the     
 River Parrett.The land is crisscrossed
 by{rhines}which are man made ditches  
 to carry away water.The{rhines}divide 
 the land into fields which used to be 
 flooded by the high tidal flows of the
 river.                                
     A protective bank has been made to
 ensure the farmland is not flooded.   
 Since then the land is gradually being
 more intensively farmed.A typical farm
 has 110 milking cows and provides 1800
 litres of milk per day(a milking cow  
 is worth Â£500).The fields in the area 
 are populated with mostly cattle and  
 some sheep.As the land improves cereal
 crops like corn,oil seed rape,fodder  
 beet and potatoes are being sown.{    
{Mr.R.Thompson}a land owner everyday   
 walks the 1000 acre area to count and 
 check the animals in each field.      </content>
