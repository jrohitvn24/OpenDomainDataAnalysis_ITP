		<content> In Penkridge there are many clubs,    
there is a club for almost every       
activity you can think of, such as:    
badminton, tennis, football, cricket,  
darts, CB, pigeon, swimming, karate,   
bell ringing, squash, judo, bingo,     
pool, riffle shooting and keep fit.    
There are also evening classes for a   
variety of activities, including lace  
making.                                
 Some of these clubs raise money for   
charity such as the CB club. They raise
money by doing many things. They do    
knitting of soft toys and the money    
they raise is paying for a mini bus for
the handicapped. They also helped to   
buy a heart machine for the health     
centre and a mini bus for the Old      
People's Home in Penkridge. The CB club
hold a meeting every Thursday night at 
the Penkridge Social Club.
