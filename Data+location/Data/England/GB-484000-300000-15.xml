		<title>15Ayston Church, Rutland</title>
		<content> Ayston Church, dedicated to St. Mary  
 the Virgin, is situated on the western
 edge of the small, rural village of   
 Ayston. The approach to the church is 
 across a small village green, with a  
 row of cottages on one side and a     
 rough hedgerow on the other. The whole
 area of the church and graveyard is   
 roughly 1200 metres squared. Both the 
 east and west boundaries of the       
 graveyard are marked by iron railings;
 on the south side there is a holly    
 hedge some 2 metres high. On the north
 side there is delapidated iron stone  
 wall about 1 metre high. The west side
 is shadowed by a small spinney of     
 beech trees, whereas on the east there
 is a characteristic yew bush.         
    The church is dominated by the     
 tower on the west side of the church. 
 The ironstone of the church is        
 covered in lichens.                   </content>
