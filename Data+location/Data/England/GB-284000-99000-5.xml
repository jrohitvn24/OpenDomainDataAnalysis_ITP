		<content> Mrs Fey lives at School Close in      
 Shobrooke. Mrs Fey has lived there for
 65 years. She lived in Cheriton       
 Fitzpaine for 12 years and then got a 
 job working Ford Farm near Cheriton   
 Fitzpaine, and then for the Shelleys  
 at Shobrooke Park as a house maid.Mrs 
 Fey enjoys living in Shobrooke except 
 there are a lot of new people around  
 which she calls 'outsiders'. School   
 Close and Silver Way are both new,    
 before that there were allotments and 
 fields there.                         
 Mrs Fey can't do her own shopping as  
 she has had an operation so her       
 daughter-in-law does it for her. Her  
 husband was awarded a long service    
 medal for 50 years in agricultural    
 work by H.R.H. Princess Anne.         
 Mrs Fey has 3 children, 10            
 grandchildren and 7 great             
 grandchildren.                        </content>
