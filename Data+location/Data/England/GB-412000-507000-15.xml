		<title>15Farming - Work is never done</title>
		<content>   Although milking, stock rearing  and
 feeding  plus grass management are the
 primary and  never ending daily  tasks
 on our farm, there are  "1,001"  other
 jobs  to  be  done.  These  include   
 maintaining the tractors and machinery
 as well as  repairing fences  and farm
 buildings.                            
   Keeping  the  livestock  healthy and
 free  from  infections  and  parasites
 requires constant vigilance. In Summer
 for example,  warble flies  would  lay
 their  eggs in the skins  thus causing
 sores  and  abcesses  or  worse.  By  
 spraying  each  cow  or  calf all over
 with a  fly repellent  every two weeks
 and coating their teats with Stockholm
 tar weekly, the problems  are avoided.
   By about  7.00p.m.  most of the jobs
 have  been completed  and we can relax
 for a few hours before bedtime- unless
 of course a cow calves in the night!  </content>
