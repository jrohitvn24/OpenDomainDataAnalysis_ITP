		<content> twist the elastic round your ankles,  
 then jump up and land with your legs  
 either side.Next take one one side of 
 the elastic over,stand on it,then jump
 up and land on both.Repeat this on    
 knees.On the next stage the elastic is
 on two legs again.First you jump into 
 the middle and out.Then you jump on to
 one side and then on to the other.Next
 you take one side of the elastic over 
 as before,but this time you jump on to
 the opposite side.Repeat this on knees
 and thighs.On the next stage you hop, 
 you aren't allowed to put your foot   
 down.You do the same as on the stage  
 before.You repeat this on knees.If you
 finish this you can go through it     
 again,but this the people standing in 
 move.Perhaps you can make up some     
 stages of your own.
