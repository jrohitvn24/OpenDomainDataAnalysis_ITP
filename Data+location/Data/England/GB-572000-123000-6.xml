		<content>           Robertsbridge Abbey         
                                       
  From what remains of Robertsbridge   
 Abbey it is difficult to imagine that 
 this building was part of one of the  
 major Religious foundations in the    
 area.                                 
  It was built by the Cistercian Order 
 in 1187.The area chosen had to conform
 to their life style.They needed to be 
 near a river for transport and for the
 good meadow land as they were mainly  
 sheep farmers.                        
  The land was given to them by local  
 landowners and the settlement of      
 Drigsell was depopulated.The people   
 were moved to what is now             
 Robertsbridge.The Abbey became        
 important as a place of work and as a 
 hospital.                             
  It was closed in 1538 by Henry V111  
 and left to decay.                    </content>
