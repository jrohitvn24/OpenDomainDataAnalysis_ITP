		<title>12Cotswold Stone Quarrying (3)</title>
		<content> Stone is blasted by controlled        
 blasting each day. Both drilling the  
 holes for explosives and the blasting 
 are skilled jobs. On the day we       
 visited the quarry we saw 44 holes 3  
 metres deep drilled by a tungsten     
 carbide drill. Each hole was filled   
 with a silver "sausage" of Powergel   
 weighing 5kg. This was made of nitrate
 material mixed with aluminium in a    
 plastic tube. The hole was filled up  
 with stemming dust, a special fine    
 stone dust from the quarry. All the   
 tubes were joined together by         
 "Cordtex" rope and detonated together 
 so that a slice of the quarry face    
 split up. A horn sounded a warning and
 traffic on nearby roads was stopped   
 while blasting took place.            
 Walling stone which rings when hit is 
 sorted out by hand. 1200 tons are on  
 order at Â£22/ton, waiting time 4 mths.</content>
