		<content> The{A51}in Woore is called the London 
 Road below the Square, and above the  
 Square it is called Nantwich Road.  In
 the past it was the on the stage coach
 route from London to Holyhead.   The  
{A525,}which crosses it in the Square, 
 is one of the holiday routes to North 
 Wales from the Midlands.              
 There used to be a{railway station at 
{Pipe Gate,}but this was closed during 
 the 1950's.                           
 Crosville run their green buses to    
 Crewe and to the Potteries.   Jones   
 Coachways run a bus service to Market 
 Drayton on Wednesdays, Market Day.    
 Our survey showed that{17 of the 26   
{families we asked never used public   
{transport.                            
 There is a{Voluntary Car Scheme}in the
 village, so that people who do not    
 have their own cars can be taken to   
 urgent appointments.                  </content>
