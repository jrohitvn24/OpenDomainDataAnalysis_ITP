		<title>10Transport in Soham</title>
		<content>   Most families in Soham own a{car,   
 but the most common form of transport 
 is the{bicycle.}Car owners use their  
 cars most frequently for leisure      
 purposes, but several drive to work.  
 Bicycles are used for similar         
 purposes, and particularly for local  
 shopping.                             
   Very few people use{public transport
 frequently, the majority using it     
 rarely or never. Of those who do use  
 it, the bus is the most commonly used,
 while for longer journies some people 
 got to Ely or Cambridge for the train.
   Asked about public transport, about 
 twice as many people thought it       
 inadequate than adequate, the main    
 complaint being that timetabling did  
 not suit working hours.
