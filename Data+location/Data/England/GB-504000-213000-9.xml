		<content> There are many legends about the area 
 around Beechwood Park School.One is   
 that a monk was foully murdered in his
 sleep in an upstairs bedroom and he   
 now haunts the school.Many of the     
 present place names are believed to be
 corruptions of eerie names.Two        
 examples of this are Dedmansey Wood   
 which was spelt as  Deadmansea        
 Wood,and it is thought that this was  
 perhaps a place where the spirits of  
 dead men were seen.                   
 Babies Wood is said to be so called   
 because of the discovery of babies    
 buried in the wood.                   
 Other creepy names in the area include
 Friendless Wood and Priors Spring.
