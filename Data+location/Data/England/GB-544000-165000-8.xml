		<title>08THE PETT FAMILY</title>
		<content>{Petts Wood} took its name from a      
famous family of shipbuilders called   
Pett. They lived in the {Tudor and     
Stuart} period and built most of the   
famous ships in that time. Two well    
known members were Peter and Phineas   
who owned two shipyards, one in        
{Woolwich} and the other in {Deptford}.
The area was all woodland in those     
days and the trees were used to build  
many famous ships.
