		<title>13The Great Western Railway</title>
		<content> The G.W.R was first started in        
 1835.This year we are celebrating 150 
 years of the railway.The main works   
 were at Swindon and at one time most  
 of the people in the town worked for  
 the G.W.R.Some people said the        
 initials stood for God's Wonderful    
 Railway.Swindon Works built all the   
 great steam engines for the           
 railway.Now only 2,000 people work    
 there and in March 1986 the works are 
 closing altogether.A lot more people  
 will be without work.
