Part of Claire's family have lived in  
the area for over two hundred          
years.Fields and trees were  replaced  
by prefabricated houses and then by new
housing estates.There were only small  
cottages in High  Street,Hill Lane and 
Railway Lane.There were far fewer      
schools for the area  than there are   
now.                                   
  Grandma remembers playing            
hopscotch,skipping and whip and top.Her
home had two rooms upstairs and two    
rooms downstairs.Three children shared 
one bed.She thinks that modern houses  
are bigger and much cleaner.           
  She has lived in the same council    
house for many years.At one time the   
rent was ten shillings (50p) a week.Now
it is twenty-seven pounds.
