 RAPE, SUGAR BEET, CONTRACT PEAS,WHEAT,
 BARLEY AND POTATOES.                  
 THERE IS CONSIDERABLE OVERLAP BETWEEN 
 THE ARABLE FARMEES AND THE MARKET     
 GARDENERS. THE BEST DISTINCTION IS    
 PROBABLY THAT THE LATTER PRODUCE ON A 
 SMALLER SCALE AMD SELL DIRECT TO THE  
 CONSUMER THOUGH EVEN HERE PICK YOUR   
 OWN STRAWBERRIES BLURRS THE           
 DISTINCTION.                          
 RECENT CHANGES ARE THE DISAPPEARANCE  
 OF HEDGES AS FIELDS HAVE BEEN MADE    
 LARGER TO ACCOMODATE EVER BIGGER      
 MACHINERY.HIGH EEC INTERVENTION       
 PRICES CURRENTLY FAVOUR CROPS AND SO  
 MUCH OLD PASTURE HAS BEEN DRAINED AND 
 PLOUGHED.THERE IS A STRONG TENDENCY TO
 SOW IN THE AUTUMN AND OILSEED RAPE HAS
 INCREASED MUCH IN ACREAGE.PEAS ARR    
 GROWN UNDER CONTRACT TO THE FROZEN    
 FOOD COMPANIES BASED IN GRIMSBY.      </content>
