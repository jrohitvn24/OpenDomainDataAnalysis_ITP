		<content> DOWN THE GRAVEL PITS.                 
 At the end of the Strand in           
 Attenborough, a small village on the  
 Nottingham - Derbyshire border, there 
 is 219 hectares of reclaimed gravel   
 workings.                             
  The gravel from the river terraces   
 has been in great demand since the    
 first world war when the swampy area  
 was used for growing reeds to make    
 baskets for the shells produced at the
 local Ordnance Factory.               
  The gravel has been extracted further
 and further away from the original    
 working near the Long Lane processing 
 plant and has now almost reached Long 
 Eaton.                                
  The gravel is transported by barge   
 from the workings to the processing   
 plant and then by lorries which       
 disturb the peace of Attenborough     
 village.                              </content>
