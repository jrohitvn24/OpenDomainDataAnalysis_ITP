		<title>17FARMING</title>
		<content> Farming life is different now.There is
 machinery instead of sythes.There is  
 also a mowing machine. It's really the
 same with milking parlours but now    
 there are machines instead of milking 
 by hand.They didn't have cubicles it  
 was just an open house.Herring bone   
 parlours are bigger than ordinary     
 parlours because you can have a       
 5x10.That means you can have 5 cows   
 milking and the other 5 waiting.      
 Instead of the churns there is a      
 tanker that moves all the milk.       
 With sheep you can't shear them very  
 well because they kick.They used to be
 cut by clippers but now they use a    
 special machine.The fleeces are tied  
 up and sent away.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
