		<title>03A DAY IN THE LIFE OF KAREN</title>
		<content> At ten to eight the day starts for    
 me.I get dressed then go into the     
 bathroom.I have a wash and brush my   
 teeth then I have my breakfast.I have 
 a mug of coffee and a slice of        
 toast.Then I get my bag and go to     
 school.I play netball in the school   
 playground before I go into school    
 because I have plenty of time.The     
 first lesson is sometimes             
 comprehension and at twenty to eleven 
 we have break and then its maths.At   
 twelve o'clock we have our dinner and 
 start the next lesson at quarter past 
 one which is sometimes art.In between 
 we have another break and then at half
 past three i go home,have a drink and 
 watch television.At half past five I  
 have my tea.
