		<content>{Denominations} The area is            
 predominantly C.of E. though there is 
 also a reasonably strong Methodist    
 community and a few Roman Catholics.  
{Parishes} The small section to the    
 east of the estuary lies within the   
 Parish of Beetham, though for         
 all practical purposes ministration is
 centred on the adjacent Parish of     
 Arnside. The west of the estuary is   
 deivided between the Parishes of      
 Levens and Lindale.                   
{Churches} The small Mission Church of 
 All Saints at Storth is ministered by 
 the Vicar of Arnside. Similarly a     
 small Methodist Chapel in Storth is   
 served by the Minister from Arnside.  
 The nearest Catholic Churches are at  
 Arnside, Milnthorpe and Grange.       
 West of the estuary residents attend  
 church at Levens, Lindale or Grange.
