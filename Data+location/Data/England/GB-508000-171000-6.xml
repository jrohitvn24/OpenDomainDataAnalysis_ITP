		<title>06LOCAL NEWS STORY</title>
		<content> It was some time last year that there 
 was a fire down Lansbury Avenue.      
 It was all over the news and in the   
 local papers.It started in the early  
 morning because as I live in the road 
 opposite i heard all of the fire      
 engines comming. It was supposed to   
 have started in the frontroom by an   
 electric fire.The children must have  
 seen the fire first because they      
 started screaming.Their father heard  
 them and he ran upstairs to get his   
 wife out of the bath. When he had     
 safely got his wife out of the house  
 he ran back inside to try and get to  
 the children but he was too late for  
 they were already dead.               
 The fire engines and ambulances were  
 only a few minutes away.It was very   
 upsetting and tradgic.
