		<title>06GOXHILL AIRFIELD.</title>
		<content> The Airfield was used from June 1942  
 to February 1945 by the United States 
 Army Airforce as a Fighter Training   
 Station. A memorial to this use, in   
 the form of a propeller set in a stone
 base, was unveiled, in 1984, by three 
 of the bases's former servicemen. The 
 propeller was part of a P38 Lockheed  
 Lightning which crashed in Goxhill on 
 May 26th, 1944. Mr J. Faulding farms  
 the land which was the airfield. The  
 buildings which remain hold farm      
 machinery, livestock, fodder etc. The 
 runways are occasionally used by crop 
 spraying aircraft. In the past the    
 hangars were used as a store for 400  
 Green Goddess fire engines. Combined  
 harvesters are now serviced, prior to 
 sale, in the two original hangars     
 whilst a modern hangar sized building 
 is an intervention store for barley - 
 part of the E.E.C. grain mountain.    </content>
