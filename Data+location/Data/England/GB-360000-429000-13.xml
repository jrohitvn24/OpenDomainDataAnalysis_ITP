		<title>13SAMLESBURY FARMING CHANGES</title>
		<content>                                       
During wartime the work was done by    
men and horses. Then the tractors came 
in about 1943-44. Now machines can cut 
the silage and there are milking       
machines whereas people used to milk   
by hand. The machines are big and      
expensive and, when they get damaged,  
it costs a lot to get them repaired.   
Even the grass used to be cut by hand. 
Not as many farmers in Samlesbury grow 
potatoes now because in world war two  
farmers had to grow crops to feed the  
country. Hardly any farmers keep       
poultry these days. Farmers used to    
employ a lot more people than they do  
now. When it was hay time they had some
Irish men working for them. The work   
the vet does has improved. He keeps the
animals in good order and he has more  
antibiotics and penicillin now.
