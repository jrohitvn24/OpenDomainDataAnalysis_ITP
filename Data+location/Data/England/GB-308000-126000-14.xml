		<content> The FACE unit occupies part of the old
 brewery in Wiveliscombe.The town was  
 prosperous when dominated by Hancocks,
 later Arnold and Hancocks.This was    
 taken over by Ushers in 1955,then by  
 Watneys,resulting in the eventual     
 closure in 1961.The site was then used
 for chicken processing.Taunton Vale   
 Transport used the cider factory as a 
 warehouse which spectacularly caught  
 fire in 1969.The shell was later      
 bulldozed and old peoples flats built.
 Those who felt that the passing of the
 brewery heralded the decline of       
 Wiveliscombe are heartened by the two 
 small establishments now brewing      
 Exmoor and Cotleigh Ale.              
 There are two other areas which have  
 attracted small businesses and        
 manufacturing industries.They offer   
 sites of 1/4 to 1 acre,on flat        
 land,with easy access to the A361     </content>
