 Although the immediate visual         
 impression of the area is one of      
 solely agricultural activity there is 
 nevertheless a considerable industrial
 presence.However that presence is less
 today (l985) than it was even 10 years
 ago.                                  
 Industrial activity today is          
 principally Primary in nature -       
 Quarrying and Forestry. Quarries - in 
 use or abandonned are found throughout
 the area:they are sand and gravel     
 quarries working fluvio-glacial       
 deposits (eskers). Forestry is less   
 important and is mainly private       
 plantations linked with farms and not 
 with the Forestry Commission. These   
 plantations provide the farmers with  
 their timber needs - fencing etc.     
 Associated with these two industries  
 and also farming are minor activities </content>
