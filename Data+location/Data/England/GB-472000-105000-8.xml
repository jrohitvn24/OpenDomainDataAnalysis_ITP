		<content>  A Mr. Stockly formed the club in the 
 1920s for his daughters who were      
 interested in sport.They formed a     
 relay team and used to challenge other
 family teams. They never lost. It was 
 closed in the 1930s when the daughters
 lost interest.                        
 In 1978 Mr. Ellis and Mr. Lovett put  
 Warblington and Hayling Schools       
 athletics teams together and formed   
 the Havant Athletic Club.Now the      
 younger children use Warblington or   
 Hayling School for training.          
 In Winter they do X_country and in    
 Summer track and field and road       
 running.They meet on Tuesdays and     
 Thursdays for training The Club is    
 soon to get a new track next to the   
 incinerator near IBM .Havant Athletic 
 Club competes in the Southern League  
 Division 3(Women) and Division 4(Men).
