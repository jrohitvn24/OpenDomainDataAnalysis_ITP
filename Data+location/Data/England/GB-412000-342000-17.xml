		<title>17Snelston Village</title>
		<content>Snelston is an attractive, unspoilt    
estate village of about 150            
parishioners.  It should stay that way 
as it is under a conservation order and
several of the cottages are Listed     
Buildings.                             
  Col. J G Stanton, who owns most of   
the estate,} lives in Snelston Hall and
several of the houses are occupied by  
estate workers, past and present.  Any 
houses becoming vacant are sold.  Even 
farm buildings are made into dwellings.
The "Stanton Arms" public house is now 
a private home.                        
  There is a well looked after church  
and graveyard, a Stone Cross War       
Memorial standing near the "Reading    
Room", where meetings, etc. are held.  
  There is a Post Office and a         
telephone booth.  Young children go to 
Clifton or Norbury schools and the     
seniors are taken to Ashbourne by bus. </content>
