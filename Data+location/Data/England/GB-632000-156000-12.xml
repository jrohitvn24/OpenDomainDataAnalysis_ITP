		<title>12Culture and Church;Sandwich</title>
		<content>Sandwich has a culturally rich environ 
ment but only limited opportunities for
the arts exist.An Adult Evening Centre 
at the Secondary School provides       
chances for learning some art and craft
skills like pottery and needlework.A   
number of art exhibitions take place   
in St.Peter's Church.The History       
Society and more than thirty other     
groups operate in the town.Three       
museums,the Guildhall,Toy and          
Richborough Castle museums also help to
preserve the town's cultural and       
artistic climate,while the White Mill  
(windmill)is also very popular.        
Of the six churches in Sandwich two are
no longer used for worship(St.Mary's   
and St.Peter's).St.Clement's is the    
Parish Church,C of E,as is the         
St.Bart's chapel.The Rector says that  
just under 10% of local people attend  
church regularly.                      </content>
