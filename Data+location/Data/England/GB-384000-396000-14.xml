		<title>14Manchester's Chinatown</title>
		<content> A distinctive non-residential         
 commercial and cultural sub-zone has  
 been developed by people of Chinese   
 origin in the last ten years. Its     
 development reflects the increased    
 immigration of people and capital     
 largely from Hong Kong.               
 The area, fringing the C.B.D.,        
 consists of a few hectares bounded by 
 Princess,Portland,Mosely and Charlotte
 streets. Premises have been obtained  
 on the lower floors of abandoned      
 textile warehouses and are utilised by
 wholesalers, restaurants, suppliers of
 oriental artefacts, financial,        
 cultural and consulate services.      
 Street architecture has been modified 
 by Chinese art and provides a         
 backcloth for traditional festivals   
 such as the Chinese New Year. A       
 weekend school uses Shena Simon       
 College.                              </content>
