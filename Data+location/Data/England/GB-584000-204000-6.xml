		<title>06THE FRANCISCAN CONVENT</title>
		<content>   The convent was built in 1888 and   
 was bought in 1957 by the Franciscan  
 Sisters from the Sadd family who were 
 timbermerchants in Maldon.The Sisters 
 came to the area because the Bishop   
 wanted a school east of London which  
 would provide a suitable education for
 catholics.The house was in five flats 
 to begin with but these were converted
 to classrooms and living accomodation.
   In 1982 the school moved out of the 
 convent buildings and the house was   
 completely renovated and refurnished. 
 It has 9 bedrooms,2 lounges,dining    
 room,visitor's room,a large kitchen,a 
 chapel and cellars for storage.       
   There are seven sisters-1 superior,1
 bursar,a headmistress,3 teachers and a
 sister who works in the parish.All the
 sisters share the work such as cooking
 cleaning,gardening and shopping.
