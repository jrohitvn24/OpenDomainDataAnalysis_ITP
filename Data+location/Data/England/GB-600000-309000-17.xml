		<content> A new bell was given in 1957 when the 
 bells were rehung on a steel frame.The
 concrete turret stairs go anticlock-  
 wise.The roof of the Lady chapel(or   
 south aisle) is covered with plaster  
 which looks like real boards.The pews 
 have animals carved on the arm rests  
 and were given to the church after the
 first world war.Infront of the        
 entrance to the belfry is a beautiful 
 font,one of the best in Norfolk;a copy
 of which is in Cromer church.The      
 chancel screen is very old.The screen 
 by the south aisle was given by the   
 Reverend John Trevelyan,the rector at 
 that time,in thanks for the safe      
 return of his son from the first world
 war. The church has normal Sunday     
 services and runs a Sunday School for 
 children. The church is part of a     
 group of parishes including Mattishall
