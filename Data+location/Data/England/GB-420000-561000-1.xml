 similar pattern of development .      
    The riverside areas are occupied by
 derelict factory sites and areas of   
 newer light industry,much of which is 
 located within the area designated as 
 an {Enterprise Zone} wherein financial
 advantages for new industries may be  
 enjoyed .                             
    In{Dunston, Elswick and Scotswood, 
 the lower valley slopes once the sites
 for terraced housing and industry     
 dating from the nineteenth century,   
 have seen much redevelopment in recent
 years  .                              
    On the southern slope in Dunston   
 and on the crest of the ridge in      
{Whickham}the housing types are more   
 varied, with a mixture of interwar    
 council housing estates, alongside    
 private housing developments .        </content>
