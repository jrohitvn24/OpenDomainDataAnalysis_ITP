		<title>11A DAY IN THE LIFE OF ALISON</title>
		<content> Today I woke up at 7.00am and lay in  
 bed until 7.30am.I dressed into my    
 school uniform and washed myself in   
 the bathroom.I made my bed.For        
 breakfast I had a bowl of             
 cornflakes.At 8.10am I did some       
 housework.At 8.40 we got in the car to
 go to school.At school,when the bell  
 rang I went into the classroom to read
 my book.We are practising our play for
 the end of term.We went into the hall 
 to look at the exhibition of work then
 we went swimming.After swimming we    
 lined up for lunch.We played on the   
 climbing frame at lunchtime and we did
 needlework after lunch until hometime.
 I went to the swimming gala practise  
 then I went home and watched The      
 Champions on the television.I then    
 played tennis on the wall and at      
 8.30pm I went to bed.
