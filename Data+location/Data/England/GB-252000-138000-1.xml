   This block of the Domesday Survey is
 mostly hilly farmland.There is some   
 forestry commission woodland which is 
 a mixture of coniferous and           
 deciduous trees.Most of the area is   
 grassland for sheep and cattle.       
 The fields and lanes are surrounded by
 high hedges which are alive with      
 wildlife.The population is very low   
 with individual houses dotted all over
 the area.Only MIDDLE MARWOOD and      
 MILLTOWN can be considered            
 villages.There are no shops,pavements,
 pubs or a regular bus service but     
 there is the local village primary    
 school which is situated in the       
 block.Apart from farming there is only
 the microfilm centre,a small amount of
 building and agricultural machinery   
 repairs as far as employment and      
 industry are concerned.               </content>
