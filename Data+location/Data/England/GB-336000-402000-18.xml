		<title>18Maghull Homes and Hospitals</title>
		<content>{    The Maghull Homes}have cared for  
 epileptic residents since 1888 when Mr
 Henry Cox bought Manor                
 House,Maghull.At the time they        
 provided a home in the country        
 convenient to Liverpool where the     
 benefits of hospital treatment could  
 be combined with a healthy outdoor    
 life,regular habits,suitable          
 employment and recreation.            
 The 5 Homes have provided care for    
 patients until the present time but   
 recently one house has been closed and
 the other has been altered to         
 accomodate elderly patients.          
{Moss Side and Park Lane}are 2 of 4    
 Special Hospitals in England(Rampton  
 and Broadmoor being the other         
 two).They are on adjoining sites in   
 Maghull and 9 miles north of          
 Liverpool.They are administered by the
 DHSS due to their special nature.     </content>
