		<title>02HEDNESFORD PAST AND PRESENT</title>
		<content>  In 1086 Hednesford was part of the   
royal hunting ground, Cannock Chase.   
Later, racehorses were trained on the  
Hills, but the emphasis upon leisure   
disappeared when the coal industry was 
established in the area at the end of  
the nineteenth century. Four           
collieries: the Â£Valley', Â£Fives',     
Cannock and Rugeley, and Wimblebury,   
were working up to the 1950s. With     
these mines came a main line railway,  
housing and employment.                
  Today, only derelict workings lie as 
testimony to this recent industrial    
past, while numerous leisure           
facilities, including Wandon Caravan   
Park, Beaudesert Golf Club, Hednesford 
Raceway and the Chase itself, reveal   
that Hednesford has returned to its    
former role. With no industrial base,  
it provides recreation for its largely 
commuting population and visitors.     </content>
