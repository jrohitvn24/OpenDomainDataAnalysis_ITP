		<content>{A Typical Day by Sarah Southworth aged
{10. }I wake in a morning and take a   
 shower and brush my teeth with        
 fluoride paste. I get dressed and pack
 my school lunch.  we leave for school,
 having locked the door and put the key
 under a bucket.  At school my friend  
 Emma rings the bell for the start of  
 lessons.  We usually begin with       
 mathematics. In assembly we sing songs
 and the girls play recorders to keep  
 us in tune.  At playtime we play games
 like tig, football, netball and       
 hopscotch. We have more lessons like  
 language work, science, topic, art and
 craft and music.  We watch television 
 programmes on the video and work with 
 computer programs using the disk      
 drive. I usually go home on the bus at
 3 o'clock. I take my puppy out for a  
 walk before tea, which might be       
 sausages, chips and peas.             </content>
