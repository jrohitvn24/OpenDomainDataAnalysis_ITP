		<title>08Children's Games,Rangeworthy</title>
		<content>{These are some of the games}played by 
 children aged 7 to 11.                
{At school}we play games like          
 football,cricket, rounders, 123 home  
 and computer games.                   
{When I'm at home,}I play in the       
 swimming pool, on the swings, on my   
 computer and I play outdoor games like
 non-stop cricket, volleyball, hide and
 seek and 123 home.                    
{123 home}is a kind of hide and seek.  
 If you see somebody who has been      
 hiding, you run to a post and say 123 
 and their name.                       
{In non-stop cricket,}there are 2      
 posts. The bowler bowls at the batter 
 who is standing by a post. The batter 
 hits or kicks the ball away and runs  
 around the posts as many times as     
 possible. If the ball is caught or the
 ball hits the post, then the batter is
 out and the next player goes in.      </content>
