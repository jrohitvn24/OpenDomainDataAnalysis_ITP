		<content> MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN OUR    
BLOCK SPEAK ENGLISH AS THEIR MAIN      
LANGUAGE.SOME FAMILIES CAME FROM       
OTHER COUNTRIES AND A FEW OF THEM      
SPEAK OTHER LANGUAGES AS WELL AS       
ENGLISH.                               
 A LOT OF THE PEOPLE HERE SPEAK WITH   
A BIRMINGHAM ACCENT.WE OFTEN DO NOT    
SAY OUR H'S WHEN WE SPEAK AND USE SOME 
WRONG WORDS LIKE CAN INSTEAD OF MAY,   
AND WAS WHEN WE SHOULD SAY WERE.       
 OUR TEACHER SAYS THAT OUR LANGUAGE IS 
CHANGING BECAUSE WE ARE ALWAYS LEARNING
NEW WORDS AND FORGETTING OTHERS.WE NOW 
TALK ABOUT COMPUTERS,PROGRAMS AND OTHER
NEW THINGS.                            
 SOME PEOPLE USE VERY BAD LANGUAGE IN  
THIS AREA.                             
 THE MOST COMMON FOREIGN LANGUAGE      
TAUGHT IN SCHOOLS IS FRENCH. GERMAN,   
SPANISH AND LATIN ARE ALSO TAUGHT IN   
SOME SCHOOLS.                          </content>
