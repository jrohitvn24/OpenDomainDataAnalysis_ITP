		<title>1121 BRIDGE ROAD ICKFORD</title>
		<content> Some of the houses in Ickford are     
 quite old .My house is 365 years      
 old.It is one of the oldest in the    
 village.My house used to be two       
 houses but now it is one big house.   
 It was built for the workmen of the   
 manor in Little Ickford. It is a      
 timber and brick house with a thatched
 roof. The feature of the house is the 
 Herringbone brick work.It has small   
 windows and low doorways.Inside most  
 of the beams are exposed.Some of the  
 beams are of ships timber and some    
 still have their bark on.There is a   
 well in the garden.
