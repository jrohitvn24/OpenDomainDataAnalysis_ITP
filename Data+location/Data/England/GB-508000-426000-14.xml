		<title>14HULLS OLD TOWN</title>
		<content> Hulls Old Town had become derilict and
 to a great extent dead.  Almost nobody
 lived there and it seemed that nobody 
 really cared.  Then in 1973 the area  
 was made into a Conservation area and 
 interst started to grow.  The area    
 has 55% of Hulls listed buildings and 
 has an area of 24.5 hectars. Not only 
 was the area ripe for conservation it 
 was also ready for development but    
 these must intergrate in terms of     
 scale, design and materials.  New     
 homes have been made from the old in  
 many imaginative ways, for instance an
 old warehouse on the side of the River
 Hull has been converted into flats    
 known as the Pease Development.  In   
 Prince street a row of houses built in
 the 1700's has been refurbished.      
 There are also many new homes at the  
 side of Princes dock, near the Pier   
 and along Mytongate, giving new life. </content>
