		<content>   The Mop is held once a year in      
 October. They have all kinds of stalls
 like darts, rubber ducks, mini        
 waltzers, and lots more. It is a      
 popular event set up between the      
 Chinese Restaurant and Lloyds Bank.   
 Teddys and goldfish are fun prizes.   
 Have you a fair or Mop in your town?  
   Pancake day is remembered by the    
 Womens Institute, who race along the  
 service road near the school. Both    
 Hillside and Alvechurch W.I. take     
 part.                                 
   Pancakes are cooked in the kitchen  
 of the Baptist church, and there is a 
 tossing competition which attracts the
 press.
