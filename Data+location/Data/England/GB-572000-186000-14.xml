		<content> Pitsea clinic is next to Pitsea       
 School.Suzanne Hayden and I went to   
 interview the clinic's receptionist.  
 She told us that the clinic opened    
 before 1940.She said that they would  
 like a new clinic.Basildon Council    
 built the clinic.She thinks that she  
 has been there the longest, which is  
 10 years.She is in charge.            
  About 330 outsiders were injected in 
 1984.She enjoys working there.The     
 services they do are:dental,weighing, 
 babies,schools,teaching women         
 expecting babies,checking babies,smear
 tests, family planning so women can't 
 have children,hearing tests,and test  
 children who are going to a special   
 school.She said the best thing about  
 the clinic is people like coming      
 because it is nice and friendly.
