		<title>20    Barham's Local Issues</title>
		<content>In the past year the Parish Council    
passed 36 planning applications for    
building. Most of them were for renewal
of permission, the original time limit 
of five years having lapsed.The council
also wanted the general public and     
people using the bowling green, which  
it owns, to pay for its upkeep. Many   
accidents, some fatal, have occurred at
the Barham crossroads on the A2 to     
Dover in recent years. The Parish      
Council amongst  others, has fought    
long and hard for a flyover. The       
Government has finally agreed to rebase
the necessary money and work should be 
underway this year. The issue of street
lighting in the village took 50 years  
to come into effect. After it was first
mentioned there was a lapse of 15 years
before the next discussion. Even when  
success came in 1968, the council still
had complaints from the public.        </content>
