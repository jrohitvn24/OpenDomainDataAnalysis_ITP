 parks.They are used for many kinds of 
 recreation.                           
{ Fog Lane Park}has open fields,swings,
 animals to feed or watch,football,    
 tennis and bowling facilities,and well
 laid out gardens.{Fletcher Moss Park  
 has a large rockery containing many   
 beautiful plants-some quite rare.{ }  
{Marie Louise Gardens}has fine specimen
 trees.{Didsbury Park}has a good       
 selection of swings for children.There
 are large open spaces and sports      
 facilities at{Ladybarn Park.          
  All the parks are well-used and in   
 many cases much loved.In crowded      
 housing areas open spaces are very    
 important to people.Dog owners are    
 becoming more aware of the sanitary   
 problems their pets cause in parks.   
 This and vandalism are areas of       
 concern yet to be resolved.           </content>
