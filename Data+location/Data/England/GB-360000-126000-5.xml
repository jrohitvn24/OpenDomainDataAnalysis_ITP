		<content> This whole thing started because Katie
 and I were so concerned about a       
 project on Ethiopia that we were doing
 at school. So we said we must help so 
 things could be sent off to help them.
 But how?                              
   Becky and I were thinking of things 
 like jumble sales, summer fetes or    
 sposored events until we came up with 
 the idea of{A GARAGE SALE.}We wanted  
 people to know so we made out leaflets
 and Becky's dad photocopied them.     
  It was a great success,it even got   
 into the papers they wrote things like
 "Kind Hearted Rebecca" "Katie and     
 Rebecca Were So Concerned"            
  We sold books, old clothes and toys  
 and raised Â£44.63.Everyone crowded    
 round the tables in Becky's garage.   
 Everyone including the Rector         
 congratulated us.{Heroes at last.
