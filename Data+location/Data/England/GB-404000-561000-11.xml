		<content> I like to play on the local football  
 field which has a special part for    
 children. There are swings and a round
 -a-bout which someone has to push.    
 I go to tap dancing classes and discos
 at the local Working Men's Club. On   
 Saturday mornings they have video     
 films shown on a large screen.        
 I help to look after a little puppy   
 which we have just got. I take it for 
 walks.

 I have a pet cat called Muffin. Mammy 
 got her on Sunday 23rd June.  It is   
 black and white with a little pink    
 nose and stripes on her head.         
 We made a basket out of a box and     
 Mammy made a blanket of odd bits of   
 wool.
