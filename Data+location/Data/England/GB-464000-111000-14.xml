		<title>14Bus Travel In Denmead.</title>
		<content>  Transport in this rural area very    
 much means either having a car or     
 walking; this is typical of rural     
 areas. The picture is one of a lack of
 public provision and a wealth of      
 private ownership.                    
  In Wecock there are 2 bus services   
 run by the National Bus Company and   
 these provide half-hourly services. In
 Denmead there is 1 service run by the 
 National Bus Company, this runs once  
 every 2 hours. However, a local       
 private  company runs a rural service 
 for the villages in this area; this   
 service runs once every hour.
