		<title>12Physical Geog. Of Coalville</title>
		<content>   Coalville is sited on a gently      
 undulating plateau approx. 525' above 
 sea level, part of the North-West     
 Leic. Coalfield. The site slopes south
 and south-westwards to the valley of  
 the River Sence and its tributaries.  
 The R.Sence flows east to west        
 immediately to the south of{Coalville 
 and is joined near Kelham Bridge by a 
 tributary flowing southwards from     
 Snibston. These two streams then flow 
 south-westwards into the catchment    
 area of the R.Tame, and ultimately in-
 to the R.Trent. To the east and south-
 east of Coalville the land rises      
 gently, reaching its highest point at 
{Bardon Hill}(912ft). The local rocks  
 consist of Triassic rocks-sands, clays
 etc., underlain by the coal measures, 
 which incline towards the older rocks 
 of the Charnwood Forest which lies to 
 the north and north-east.             </content>
