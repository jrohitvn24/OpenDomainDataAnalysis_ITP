		<title>01BROCKHAM BONFIRE</title>
		<content> The Brockham Bonfire is held every    
 year on the nearest Saturday to       
 November the 5th.The proceeds go to   
 local charities and the Bonfire       
 Committee.A lot of hard work goes into
 the making of the Bonfire and all work
 is done voluntarily.The Bonfire       
 Committee usually start to build it   
 about two months before Nov 5th and it
 is said to be the second biggest of   
 its kind in Britain.It is a fun       
 occasion and a treat for everyone.The 
 Committee usually spend about Â£1000 on
 the fireworks.The fireworks used to be
 held near the bonfire on the village  
 green but that has been considered too
 dangerous so they are now lit in a    
 nearby field to view from the sky.    
 There is also a band which starts     
 playing at Strood Green and at 7.45 it
 arrives at the green where torches    
 from the procession light the bonfire.</content>
