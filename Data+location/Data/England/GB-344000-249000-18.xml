		<title>18HOP GROWING NEAR CANON PYON</title>
		<content> Hops are grown in the N.West corner.  
 Lisa's uncle sprays the nettles and   
 docks to prevent them choking the     
 hops.Polythene is put round the hops  
 to make them grow faster.When they are
 ripe the hop bines are cut down from  
 the supporting wires.Then taken by    
 tractor and trailer back to the farm  
 building where the{hop machine}is     
 housed.The machine strips the hops    
 from the bine.Lisa's Gran and aunties 
 pick the leaves out.The hops are then 
 put onto trays and are taken to the   
{'kill' (kiln)}to be dried.After drying
 they are put into huge polypropylene  
 sacks called{pockets.}The fan of the  
 hop drier is noisy and can be heard at
 Bush Bank during the night.Lisa       
 belongs to a family of{travellers}who 
 live in modern style caravans on the  
 farm. Hop-growers have had problems   
 with disease and over-production.     </content>
