		<content> Our Domesday block is a typical arable
 landscape of low hills and valleys,   
 with scattered areas of woodland. The 
 main London to Edinburgh railway line 
 slices through from north to south,   
 following the shallow valley of the   
 River Glen.                           
  The B1176 Grantham to Stamford road  
 follows the same route.               
  Three settlements come into our area.
{Little Bytham}is the largest, but it  
 is cut in two by the northern boundary
 of our block (unfortunately our school
 is outside the area, as are the homes 
 of many of the children).             
  The small village of{Careby}is in the
 centre of our block (with some fields 
 belonging to the tiny settlement of   
 Aunby in the same parish). Part of the
 picturesque hamlet of{Holywell}is also
 included.{
