		<title>07 COMPUTER MAINTENANCE</title>
		<content>    There is a computer repair company 
 in the village of{Ramsden Heath}which 
 has five branches throughout the      
 country. The local factory carries out
 between{fifty}and{sixty}repairs each  
 day.                                  
    Up to seventy five workers are     
 employed,mostly carrying out repairs  
 at the factory. They have vans and    
 company cars for delivering,a few     
 repairs being done on the spot.       
    In addition they make computer     
 software packages. The engineers      
 occupy two buildings and everyone is  
 frantically busy each morning. After  
 lunch work is usually well enough in  
 hand for the pace to slacken a little.
 By this means they are able to prevent
 a backlog of work from building up,an 
 essential requirement for an efficient
 repair business.                      
    The men enjoy their work immensely.</content>
