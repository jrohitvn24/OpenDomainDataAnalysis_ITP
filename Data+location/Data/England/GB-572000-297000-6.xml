		<content> Early morning starts with doorstep    
 delivery of milk,bread and other dairy
 produce.The postman delivers mail and 
 parcels daily.Newspapers and          
 periodicals are also delivered        
 daily.The majority of vegetables,much 
 fruit and some meat are home produced 
 with surplus stocks stored in the     
 freezer for use in winter months.Most 
 families travel 12-20 miles to nearby 
 towns for a weekly or monthly shop and
 use the village shops for top-up      
 supplies or forgotten items.Young     
 children attend the village playgroup 
 and until 11 years old children are   
 educated within the village.Most      
 families own dogs,cats or rabbits and 
 several own goats for milk production 
 or grass cutting services.            
 Entertainment tends to be home based. 
 Family life prevails.
