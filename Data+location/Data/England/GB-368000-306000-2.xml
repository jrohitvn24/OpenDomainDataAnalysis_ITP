		<title>02STIRCHLEY GRANGE HISTORY</title>
		<content>{STIRCHLEY GRANGE}is probably the      
 oldest house in our area.Parts of it  
 are 300 years old,but there has been a
 dwelling there for about 700 years.It 
 was given to the monks of{Buildwas    
{Abbey}by{Osbert of Stirchley}who      
 farmed it until the dissolution of the
 monasteries by{Henry VIII.}It forms an
 important part of our{LOCAL HISTORY,  
 as subsequent owners were involved in 
 the{Gunpowder Plot,}and one of them,  
{Francis Throckmorton,}was beheaded for
 plotting against{Elizabeth I.}The     
 estate was bought and sold several    
 times and because of the unique area  
 it is situated in,the owners had local
 business interests in iron and coal   
 mining. It is close to the{IRONBRIDGE 
{GORGE}which was the birthplace of the 
{INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION.}In 1964 it was 
 bought by{Dawley New Town}for use as a
 tree and shrub nursery.               </content>
