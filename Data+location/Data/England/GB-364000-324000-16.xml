		<content> Originally there were two village     
 shops in Childs Ercall selling a great
 variety of items unfortunately both   
 have closed down except for the sub   
 post section of one of them the small 
 village of Ollerton has a butcher who 
 has a shop in Newport but also sells  
 meat in the village.                  
 A mobile shop comes to the village    
 once a week, this shop sells a good   
 range of items.Newport and Market     
 Drayton both being approximately six  
 miles from Childs Ercall are popular  
 shopping towns. Telford (New Town) has
 a large shopping centre with many     
 large stores and a hyper_Market, this 
 too is a popular shopping centre.A    
 little further afield there is        
 Shrewsbury an excellent shopping      
 centre and also the Potteries which is
 a collection of towns within easy     
 reach of each other.                  </content>
