    "Going to hospital" by Kerry Ubly. 
                                       
    My mum woke me up one morning and  
 said, "Come on, Kerry, you have to go 
 to hospital today."                   
    So I jumped out of bed and got     
 dressed. I went downstairs and        
 had my breakfast.The time was 8o'clock
 when we left our house.We had be there
 by 10.30. We got there dead on 10.30. 
 But we had to wait for a very long    
 time. I have to go there about every  
 two years because I have got a hole in
 the muscle of my heart.               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
