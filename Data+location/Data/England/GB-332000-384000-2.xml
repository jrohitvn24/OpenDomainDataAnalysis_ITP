{ Port Sunlight}was built for the      
 people who worked at{Lever Brothers.} 
{My dad}works at Lever Brothers.  He   
 has worked there for 13 years.  Port  
 Sunlight was built on a tributary of  
 the{River Mersey.} There is still some
 of the river there, it flows in a     
 little pier at{Lever Brothers. }The   
 water is polluted with soap powder and
 washing-up liquid waste. Our house was
 used as a{ticket house}in{1890}and it 
 is still standing today.  We have been
 living in this house for 12 years.  We
 are situated opposite the railway.    
 The{managers}of the{railway}worked and
 slept there, but now it is used for   
 families but you can still see where  
 the people used to queue for tickets.
