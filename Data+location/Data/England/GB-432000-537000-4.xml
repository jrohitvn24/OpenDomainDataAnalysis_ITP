		<title>04QUARRINGTON CLUB &amp; TRIP</title>
		<content> Every year the Working men's Club     
 organises a trip to Whitley Bay.About 
 6 weeks beforehand we get a form to   
 fill in to say how many are going and 
 their ages.                           
 There are 4 buses.We set off at 9.00am
 and return at 5.00pm.Often people hire
 deck chairs and tents.The club gives  
 all of the children Â£2.00 each.This   
 year (1985) we are going on June 29th.
 I go with my mam,dad,brother and      
 sister.First we go on the beach then  
 at 1.00pm we go to the shops.Later we 
 go on the dodgems and other shows at  
 the fairground.We buy candy rock for  
 Nana and Granda.Then it's back to the 
 beach for a picnic.After that we go   
 down to the sea until it is time for  
 the bus to go home.                   
 The Club has a snooker room,lounge and
 a bar.There is a juke box and a       
 television.                           </content>
