		<content>   {Table Skittles}                    
     The Arnold Arms, George and Red   
 Lion all have table skittles. Each    
 player has three cheeses to throw.    
 There are nine skittles to aim at. If 
 you knock all the skittles down with  
 one or two throws then they are put up
 again and you still finish your three 
 goes. Although there are only nine    
 skittles a good player will sometimes 
 score 14 or 15.                       
      The skittles are on a specially  
 designed table. There is a big net    
 behind and a little on the sides. The 
 sides are also padded.                
   {Darts}                             
      There are darts teams in all the 
 pubs. The W.I. have a ladies team in  
 Kilsby. After the match proper        
 sometimes all of one team play 1001   
 aganst all of the other. The loosing  
 team buys the beer for the winners.   </content>
