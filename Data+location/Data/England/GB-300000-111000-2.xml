		<content> Near {ST. ANDREWS }there is{          
 a{METHODIST CHURCH.                   
   We found out about a few factories  
 in the area ;{LLOYD MAUNDERS}was the  
 largest.                              
{ LLOYD MAUNDERS}This is an abbatoir.  
 They have 750 staff and they receive  
 the animals on the hoof.Then they     
 slaughter them and pack the meat up   
 and send it away using their own      
 transport.                            
   Not far from the abbatoir there is  
 the{M5 MOTORWAY}and the{LONDON-EXETER 
{RAILWAY}.Three miles north is the     
{NORTH DEVON LINK ROAD}which makes     
 traffic a lot less busy in            
 Halberton.In the north of the area    
 there is a canal which starts at      
 Tiverton and ends at Lowdwells.North  
 of the canal seems hilly and south    
 seems rather flat.
