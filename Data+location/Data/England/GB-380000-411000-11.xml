		<content>  Mr. Smalley told us what we were     
 going to do, he said you will be going
 to see a printing machine, the        
 library, and the computer room. We all
 split into two groups, some of us were
 in Mr. Webb's group and some went into
 Mrs. Stroud's group. I was in Mrs.    
 Stroud's group. First Mrs. Stroud's   
 group went into the printing room. Mr.
 Pollard was the person who controld   
 (sic) the printing machine. He copied 
 a picture. Then we went into the      
 library and there were two secretarys.
 We gathered round the secretarys'     
 desks. They showed us how to work     
 their electronic typewriters, after   
 that I talked to Mr.Smalley on the    
 telephone. We went to the library     
 part. There were films the teachers'  
 could borrow. Soon we went up to the  
 computer room.
