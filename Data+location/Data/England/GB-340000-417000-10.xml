		<title>10A Typical School Day.</title>
		<content> I wake up on a Friday morning about   
 7.30 and get up about 7.35. I go      
 downstairs have a bath get dressed and
 have my breakfast. I clear the table  
 and go to wash my hands and face and  
 clean my teeth. I go to school on my  
 bicycle. At school we have an assembly
 and then Hymn practice. After that we 
 have News with Mrs Vickers. We have   
 our dinners at school they cost 51p.  
   In the afternoon we change our      
 library books. Sometimes we have P.E. 
 After school I go to Gym club for an  
 hour. When I get home my sister and I 
 go for our Piano lessons. When we come
 back we have our tea and go to the    
 Youth Club at Sunday School. When we  
 get back we go to bed so that we are  
 ready for an early start the next day.
