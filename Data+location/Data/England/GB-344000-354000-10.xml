		<title>10My Special Day</title>
		<content> My special day was when I had my      
 fishing licence when we went to       
 Chester.                              
 I got a licence for the River Dee and 
 I felt very excited. We went in a     
 fishing shop. I also bought a box and 
 some maggots, two floats, a bag of    
 weights, hooks and a line. I felt     
 very pleased and I love fishing.      
 The next day I went fishing in the    
 river and I went at 9.30am but I did  
 not catch anything. I had a trout but 
 it fell off so I kept on trying. At 6 
 0'clock I went home and had my tea.   
 In the day there were six men fishing 
 but only one man caught a fish and    
 that was an eel. The other men were   
 like me and didn't catch anything.    
 I had spent 8\ hours fishing and      
 caught nothing so I went home, but I  
 hope to catch a salmon when I go      
 again another day.                    </content>
