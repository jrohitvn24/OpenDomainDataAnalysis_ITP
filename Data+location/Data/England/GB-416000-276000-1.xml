		<title>01Gazetter of the Knowle Area</title>
		<content>      The Knowle area is on the S.     
 fringe of West Midlands area and is   
 "urban" and "rural" in nature. It is  
 separated from the conurbation by a   
 narrow band of green fields and the   
 M42 motorway.                         
      The area can be divided into 2   
 sections W. and E. The W. part is     
 mostly suburban housing centred on    
 Knowle for the conurbation. Since the 
 War housing has spread S.W. from      
 Knowle absorbing the hamlet of Bentley
 Heath where the most recent housing   
 estates are still being built.        
      The E. area is "green belt" land 
 forming a "buffer zone" between       
 Birmingham and Coventry. Currently it 
 is farming countryside with limited   
 industrial and housing development in 
 the local villages eg Berkswell.
