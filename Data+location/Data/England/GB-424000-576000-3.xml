		<title>03Cramlington:A Housing Estate</title>
		<content> The local estate we are describing is 
 called{Eastfield Dale.}It was built in
 1976. On Eastfield Dale there are 42  
 detached houses (they stand alone) 22 
 semi-detached and 7 terrace houses.   
 Some have garages. All have gardens.  
                                       
 Most of the roads are cul-de-sacs and 
 are safe for the children to play in. 
                                       
 There is no open space on the estate. 
 The land slopes gently to the North.  
                                       
 Eastfield school is close to the      
 estate but the children have to cross 
 a road. There is an underpass (a      
 tunnel under the road, but the        
 children do not use it. It is too far 
 out of their way.
