		<content> The nearby 'Arthur's Stone', an       
 ancient burial chamber, indicates very
 long-standing settlement. Some old    
 cottages, still in use, were built of 
 rounded stones from stream-beds, and  
 rough stones from the fields, jointed 
 only with clay; these may well outdate
 the Norman churches and cottages built
 with dressed stones. In Tudor times   
 timber-framed buildings came into use 
 and in the Victorian era many cottages
 were 'modernised' with a brick facing.
 In the middle of the present century  
 houses were built of brick and        
 concrete blocks. Some of the old      
 cottages have been extended, but no   
 new houses have been built in the last
 20 years. Although there are          
 relatively few dwellings in the area, 
 they illustrate the variety of house- 
 building methods in use over many     
 centuries.                            </content>
