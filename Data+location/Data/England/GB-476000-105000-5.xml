		<title>05LIFE ON A FARM (II)</title>
		<content>   Life on a farm in the 1980's is a   
 good life.It is a much easier life    
 than it used to be;lorries collect the
 milk and make it into butter,instead  
 of the wife having to churn it.       
   In September &amp; October the new seed 
  is sown with a seed drill.Some land  
 is not ploughed,it is sown directly   
 into the soil.                        
   In November &amp; December the cows are 
 calving and any general repairs are   
 done.                                 
  January &amp; February is the lambing    
 season and is the busiest time of the 
 year for sheep farmers.               
   March &amp; April,the spring seed is    
 sown along with maize.                
   In May &amp; June,silage(pickled        
 grass)is cut.                         
   July &amp; August is the harvest        
 time,when all farmers who grow crops  
 work long hours.                      </content>
