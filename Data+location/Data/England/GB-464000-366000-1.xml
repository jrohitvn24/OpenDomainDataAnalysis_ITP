		<content>      The whole block of land surveyed 
 is located in North Nottinghamshire,  
 near what is still part of Sherwood   
 Forest . Nearby towns include         
 Mansfield, Newark, Retford and        
 Worksop.                              
     {New Ollerton}owes its existence  
 to the relatively recent discovery of 
 coal in the area, and is essentially a
 mining community. In contrast, the    
 adjacent villages of{Ollerton}and     
{Boughton}(and nearby{Wellow}) have    
 existed for centuries - the former    
 even having been recorded in the      
 original Domesday Book. This          
 difference in age greatly determines  
 the present-day character of each     
 place.                                
      Surrounding these residential    
 areas there is a considerable amount  
 of farmland and open countryside.
