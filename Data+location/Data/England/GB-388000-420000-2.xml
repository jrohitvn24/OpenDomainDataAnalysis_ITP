		<content>   Owner - Mrs. Earnshaw (Senior)      
 Worked by Mr. &amp; Mrs. W. Earnshaw and  
 sons.                                 
   The farm is built of local stone and
 is about 100 years old. It is an      
 established family farming business   
 run as a dairy and sheep farm covering
 50 acres.                             
   The Earnshaws have a herd of 24     
 cows, 300 sheep, 4 working dogs, 3    
 guard dogs and 1 pup, plus 40 free    
 range hens.                           
   The farming year starts in April at 
 lambing time. The sheep are clipped in
 June and dipped in August and October.
 Hay making is a busy time and takes   
 place between July and August.        
   Mr. Earnshaw gets up to milk the    
 cows and clean the shippons at 6.00   
 a.m. He milks again at night and goes 
 to bed at 9.00 p.m.
