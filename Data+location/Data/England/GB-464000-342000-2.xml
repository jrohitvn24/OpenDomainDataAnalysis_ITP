		<title>02BURTON JOYCE-LOCAL HISTORY.</title>
		<content>  In the original Domesday Book,Bertune
 is mentioned.It was evidently a small 
 village,though it could boast a church
 and a priest,a meadow and woodland    
 pasture,the value of the village being
 one silver mark. Bertune could mean   
 either"the farm on the hill"or"the    
 farm in a fortified place"and for     
 centuries,Burton Joyce remained an    
 agricultural village.Some of the names
 of the roads (Willow Wong,Criftin)    
 testify to this.                      
  Today,Burton Joyce,Bulcote and Stoke 
 Bardolph boast a population of 3,591  
 according to the 1981 census;a number 
 which continues to grow.Burton Joyce  
 has three churches,a school,three     
 public houses,numerous shops and a    
 variety of architectural styles.There 
 are also two neighbouring buildings,  
 Braybrook,a home for the elderly,and  
 Westwolds,catering for the blind.     </content>
