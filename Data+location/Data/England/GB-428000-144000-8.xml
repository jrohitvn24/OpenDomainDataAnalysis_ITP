 villages but only one chapel. Kimpton,

 early Victorian. Amport and Monxton   
 are two of the parishes of which the  
 vicar is Michael Grylls who is also   
 the Rural Dean. The vicar comes into  
 Amport School every other week to take
 Assembly; the older children go to    
 Amport Church to learn bellringing &amp;  
 the whole school often visits the     
 church for services. Amport Church    
 dates from 1320 &amp; Monxton from 1466.
