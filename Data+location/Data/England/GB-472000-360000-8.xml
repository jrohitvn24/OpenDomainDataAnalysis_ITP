		<content>    The study group interviewed a      
 random selection of 25 households in  
 Caunton.                              
    Each household had approximately 2 
 children though these children were   
 not necessarily still at home.        
    It was discovered that cleaning    
 windows and ironing were the most     
 unpopular household tasks.            
    On average each household had 5    
 pets,mostly dogs and cats.            
                                       
 In a survey of labour-saving devices  
 used in the households the group found
