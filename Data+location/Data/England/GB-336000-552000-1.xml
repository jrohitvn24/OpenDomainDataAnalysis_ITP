		<content> The area we have been asked to report 
 on for this project is a mixture of   
 urban and rural industrial and        
 residential and both old and new      
 housing.Well over half of the area is 
 composed of agricultural land .The    
 land is fertile covered mainly by good
 grass on which graze large dairy      
 herds.The urban development consists  
 of the Denton Holme area,developed    
 first in the nineteen century but     
 whitch in the is still changing and   
 the Morton Park area planned in the   
 1950s by the city council to provide  
 modern housing for a growing          
 population.The council estate grew    
 throughout the 1960s and was added to 
 in the early 1970s when an estate of  
 private houses was erected on the     
 north side of the Wigton road with    
 many of the houses being constructed  
 to individual designs.                </content>
