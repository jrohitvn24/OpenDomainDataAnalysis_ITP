		<title>02A child's view of Clapham</title>
		<content> Clapham is very small and there are   
 only about 3OOO people there.   It is 
 mostly quiet but in the morning it is 
 noisy.   I appreciate the way that    
 Clapham is tidy.   I think that the   
 shops in Clapham sell the most        
 wonderful things.   In Clapham there  
 are four garages in all different     
 directions and most of them have low  
 prices for the petrol and oil.   In   
 Clapham it is almost exciting because 
 of its parks.   There is a river      
 called the River Ouse, but it is easy 
 to cross at the ford.   People fish   
 and swim and row there.   It must be  
 good.   It is nice in Clapham because 
 the people are friendly.   I like     
 living there.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
