		<content>   A gentle bend in the picturesque    
 River Wye forms the most prominent    
 feature in the area.  To either side  
 of this one sees rolling hills with   
 most of the land being used for       
 growing crops and grazing for sheep   
 and cattle. This is an area where one 
 sees many more farm animals than      
 people.                               
   Some remote farmhouses can be found 
 by those who are prepared to leave    
 their cars and follow the many        
 footpaths which are signposted.       
   But it is the River Wye which holds 
 the attraction for most visitors into 
 the area, whether it is for some      
 fishing, or rafting, or canoeing, or  
 merely to find a peaceful camping     
 spot.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
