		<content>{&lt;Cont}The crop to be planted depends  
 on economic and aesthetic             
 considerations. Therefore as well as  
 softwoods which are economically      
 attractive, hardwoods such as{Oak}and 
{Beech}are also planted. These are     
 thinned over a 20 year cycle and are  
 not ready for felling until they are a
 minimum of 80 years old. Oak tree     
 saplings are now being planted in     
{expanded tubes}which are biodegradable
 as can be seen in{Stubby Copse}and    
{Woodfidley Inclosures.}These give a   
 greenhouse effect. The sapling reaches
 the top of the tube in one year. One  
 tube is planted every 20 square metres
 so this reduces the cost of saplings:
