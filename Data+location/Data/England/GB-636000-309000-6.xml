		<content>     North Burlingham is a quiet and   
 small place, not very modern,not so   
 vintage; so-so I should say. It has   
 farms, houses a few tracks and roads  
 and a bowling green.                  
    It was difficult to find people to 
 interview, most people are out at work
 during the day. One house we went to  
 the people were away but their great  
 big dog was there though. It jumped up
 and licked my face. It ran on to the  
 rest and the rest made a fuss of it.  
 We all went back to the minibus and   
 the dog followed us into the minibus  
 as Mr Gleeson was about to put his    
 seat belt on. He went out round the   
 back of the minibus and pulled the dog
 out by the scruff of the neck because 
 it didn't go out when the said.
