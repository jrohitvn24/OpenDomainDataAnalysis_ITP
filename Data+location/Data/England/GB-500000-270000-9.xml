This sectiion describes the type of    
items made at the works and how they   
were made. The clay was dug from the   
claypits next to the works. It was     
dried and put into metal moulds. These 
were then stacked in kilns holding 30- 
40,000 bricks, and baked for three     
weeks. The maximum temperature in the  
kilns was 1200 degrees centigrade.     
After being fired, they were stacked   
onto waiting lorries or, in earlier    
days, trains. The works employed 12 men
during the summer, but only 4 in the   
winter. The works made bricks, roofing 
tiles and land drainage  pipes. From   
1919 until 1927 it specialised in      
wirecut facing bricks, from 1928 until 
1939, hand made moulding bricks and    
during World War 2, land drainage pipes
for the Ministry of Agriculture. Hand  
made facing bricks were made until 1975</content>
