		<title>12Bridgnorth Charity Walk</title>
		<content> The Bridgnorth Walk is a traditional  
 sponsored walk held on Spring Bank    
 Holiday Monday from Bridgnorth to and 
 up the Brown Clee Hill and back again,
 a distance of 22 miles.  The walk     
 commences in the High Street, and is  
 usually started by the Town Mayor and 
 the walkers follow the Ludlow Road to 
 Ditton Priors, climb the Clee and walk
 back to Bridgnorth.  For children,    
 there is a shorter 7 mile walk which  
 starts and finishes in Ditton Priors  
 and takes the walkers to the summit of
 the Clee.  Participants in the walk   
 raise money for various charities by  
 walking as a team of ten and by being 
 sponsored for each mile they walk by  
 kind friends.  The walk is very       
 popular and has to be restricted to   
 800 adults and 300 children, although 
 lots more would like to take part.In  
 1986, 17,000 pounds will be raised.   </content>
