		<content>   In an interview with Mr.J.A.Beswick,
 former headmaster of Bowdon           
 C.E. Primary School,he was asked what 
 changes had occurred during his 27    
 years in the area.                    
   When he first came to live in the   
 area there were not as many houses as 
 there are today.There are more houses 
 because the owners of land sold it to 
 builders.Then{Church Commission}land  
 was open fields.{Gaddum Estate}was    
 built on this land and fields which   
 were fallow.They were also sold for   
 private building in the village.A     
 scheme for{IBM}to build a factory was 
 defeated because of objections raised 
 by residents.It is still fallow land. 
   Bowdon is now twice the size as it  
 was 28 years ago.                     
   Mr.Beswick said that many houses had
 been made into flats,such as the      
 houses on the{"Firs".                 </content>
