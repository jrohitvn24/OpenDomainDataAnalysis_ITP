		<content>ii. The manor House.                   
The Manor House in High St. was        
recently bought for modernisation and  
was visited by a group of children.The 
building is of local ironstone and     
thatch.It dates from the sixteenth     
century.                               
                                       
    "We entered a short passage and    
then the main living room.There used to
be an old gas lamp a year ago which was
so low that people kept bumping into   
it. There had been no electricity or   
running hot water.The previous owner   
had lived there alone until she was    
seventy and was used to living without 
such luxuries.                         
     In places ceilings are falling    
down and floors are unsafe because of  
the effect of Death Watch Beetle.In the
oldest part wooden pegs hold the beams 
together instead of nails."            </content>
