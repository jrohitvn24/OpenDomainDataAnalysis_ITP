		<title>11ST MICHAEL'S CHURCH</title>
		<content> The church in Bishop Middleham is     
 called St Michaels. It is a Church of 
 England and villagers have worshipped 
 here for many years.                  
 It stands on a hill in the old part   
 of the village in beautifully kept    
 grounds. Recently floodlighting has   
 been installed to highlight the       
 exterior of the church at night.      
 Built around 1200, the church has many
 ancient features remaining including  
 the carved front porch and the        
 Frosterley marble font. The stained   
 glass window in the west wall portrays
 St Michael to whom the church was     
 dedicated.                            
 The church has regular Sunday and     
 weekday services and has a choir which
 includes some of the schoolchildren.
