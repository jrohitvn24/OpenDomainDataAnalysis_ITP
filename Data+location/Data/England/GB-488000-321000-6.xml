		<title>06STAINBY VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Stainby has some 83 Residents, mainly 
 consisting now of families who have   
 moved into the area; very few original
 villagers are left.  The old village  
 community spirit no longer exists,    
 many of the bread winners commute to  
 work and the wives shop in the nearby 
 town of Grantham or further afield.   
 The land area in and around Stainby is
 mainly agricultural, crops being of   
 barley, wheat, some rape &amp; peas.  The 
 soil is of ironstone base, most of    
 the land having been quarried and then
 reclaimed; as a result the quality is 
 poor.  Modern fertilizers enable crops
 to be grown in most areas; the        
 craggier soil is used for grazing,    
 mainly for sheep. The land it self is 
 worked by tenant farmers - most of the
 area is owned by Buckminster Trust    
 Estate, the largest land-owning Estate
 in the district, through most farmers </content>
