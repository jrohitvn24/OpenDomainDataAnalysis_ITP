		<content> The agricultural land in this area is 
 99 percent arable.   Main crops grown 
 are cereals, potatoes, sugar beet,    
 peas &amp; rape.   There are lighter      
 patches of soil in some areas growing 
 vegetables and bulbs amounting to 8%  
 of the area.   The land appearance is 
 level with slight rises and the whole 
 of the area is bordering on sea level.
 The River Witham which crosses the    
 area is a navigable water way.   Its  
 main useful purpose is to carry the   
 highland drainage water to the sea.   
 The area is used for boating and water
 recreational sports.   The whole area 
 is drained by drains such as the North
 Forth Foot and Castledyke Drains which
 go through this area.   The housing of
 the area is for Agricultural Workers  
 and rural based industries.
