		<title>10Changes in Heywood.1.</title>
		<content>  Fourth year pupils at Sutherland High
 school carried out a street survey to 
 find out what changes people had seen 
 and what they thought of {Heywood }   
 today. People felt there had been a   
 decline in {entertainment }with a lack
 of dancing and the closure of the     
 town's cinemas. At one time there were
 4,now none. Many were worried by the  
 increasing {unemployment }and the     
 decline of the {cotton industry}in    
 which most of them had worked. They   
 would not wish to be leaving school or
 looking for a job today, even though  
 they thought a wider variety of jobs  
 were being done in the town.Few had a 
 very high opinion of {Heywood }as a   
 place and most of the blame for this  
 was put on the council in {Rochdale } 
 and the take-over of 1974. Many wanted
 to see {Heywood }run its own affairs  
 again.                                </content>
