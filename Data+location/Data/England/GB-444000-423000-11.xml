		<content> Fashion in 1985 is changing rapidly.  
 Nearly every week a new kind of       
 fashion is displayed in leading shops 
 such as Gossip, Miss Siam, and Tip    
 Top.  Patterns of flowers are found on
 skirts, trousers and blouses etc.     
 Many children wear denim jeans, sweat 
 shirts, or pale skirts and white      
 socks.  Most girls are wearing Jesus  
 boots which have lots of straps,      
 similar to Roman sandals.  There are  
 many different hair styles such as    
 Mohican, a long stip of hair running  
 down the middle of the head. Flashed  
 hair has lighter streaks of hair added
 to their natural colour. The skinhead 
 is very very short hair. Many girls   
 wear earings, rings, bangles and      
 necklaces.  Girls also wear make-up   
 like multi-coloured lipstick, eye     
 liner and eye shadow.
