		<title>08ANIMAL FARMING</title>
		<content> On a{dairy farm}the farmer milks the  
 cows twice a day (in the morning and  
 evening). First he cleans the dairy   
 and then gets the food ready. He      
 cleans the udders. He puts the milking
 machine on and starts milking. He then
 returns the cows to the fields to let 
 them graze. He cleans the dairy out   
 again and gets the milk ready to send 
 to the dairy. Then he checks the cows 
 and calves. He repeats this process in
 the evening. Some female calves       
 (heifers) and males calves (steers)   
 are kept for{meat.}The farmer buys the
 calves from auctions to fatten them   
 up and them sell them again. These    
 cows are called{stores.}Some of the   
 farms keep{pigs.}They are kept in     
 piggeries. They are kept intensively, 
 that is a lot of pigs in one building.
