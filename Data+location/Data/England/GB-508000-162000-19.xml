		<title>19St.George's Hill</title>
		<content> The name St. George's Hill is 1600    
 years old.                            
 2 million years ago St.George's Hill  
 was a paeolithic camp 14 acres long.  
 Weybridge was a big marsh so the camp 
 was the only dry area.                
 Did you know the Grand Old Duke of    
 York is true? He marched up and down  
 this hill with his soldiers for       
 training.                             
 In 1852 the last duel ever was held on
 St. George's Hill.                    
 Geographically speaking ,St. George's 
 Hill now covers about 4 square        
 kilometres in area, with woodland     
 covering a lot of the space. All the  
 houses have very big gardens of at    
 least an acre. Many very famous people
 live here.                            
 There is here an underground reservoir
 with 3 days supply of water,a big golf
 course and a tennis club.             </content>
