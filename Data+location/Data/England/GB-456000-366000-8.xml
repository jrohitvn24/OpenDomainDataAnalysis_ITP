		<title>08Warsop Fire Station.</title>
		<content>  The fire station was built in{1972}on
 the site of a demolished farm         
 alongside the A60 road in the village.
 The station is only manned when there 
 is an emergency or for training       
 sessions which are held regularly.All 
 the firemen are "retained",that is,   
 part-time volunteers,their main       
 occupations being at local collieries 
 or with British Rail.                 
                                       
  There is only one fire engine.       
                                       
 During{the past year}there have been  
{144}call-outs,the majority to fires in
 buildings,grassland or heathland fires
 and chimney fires.Unfortunately there 
 were 16 malicious calls.              
  Assistance was given to other        
 stations on 7 occasions.
