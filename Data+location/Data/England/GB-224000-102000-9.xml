		<title>09Bridgerule Stores</title>
		<content>  The local newsagent's shop used to be
 part of the brewery owned by the      
 village inn. After this it was a      
 tailor's shop and has had five        
 previous owners.                      
  The present owners have lived in     
 Bridgerule for fifteen years and now  
 run the shop as a general store       
 selling packet and tinned foods,      
 newspapers and household items such as
 sewing and cleaning materials and     
 stationery.                           
  The Post Office is run by a father   
 and son team who have lived in        
 Bridgerule all their lives. The shop  
 doubles as a grocer's shop, and       
 although very small, stocks everything
 imaginable from toothpaste and cotton 
 wool to fresh cut ham and cheese.     
  Together, these two shops provide the
 local residents with everyday needs as
 well as being friendly meeting places.</content>
