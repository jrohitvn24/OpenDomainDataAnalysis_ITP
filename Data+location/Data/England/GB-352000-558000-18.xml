		<title>18Education - Residential.</title>
		<content> Milton Hall School, run by the        
 Sunderland Education Authority,       
 provides residential care for boys    
 with special needs.                   
 These boys, between the ages of eleven
 and sixteen come from Sunderland and  
 North Tyne.                           
 Facilities in the school are good,    
 with a high pupil-teacher ratio. There
 are pleasant grounds, playing fields  
 and a play barn for wet days.         
 Most of the staff live on the premises
 and as well as their teaching duties, 
 supervise other activities. There are 
 care and domestic staff as well as    
 teachers.                             
 The number of pupils has been steadily
 falling and is now down to seventeen  
 so there is some doubt as to whether  
 the school will remain open much      
 longer.                               
                                       </content>
