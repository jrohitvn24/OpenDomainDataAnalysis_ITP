		<content>  There are records of settlement on   
 the site of Lenham as early as 804    
 when King Cenulf granted the Manor of 
 Lenham to the Abbot of St. Augustine's
 of Canterbury. A Saxon burial was     
 unearthed in 1946.                    
  The tithe barn and stonework in the  
 churchyard are relics of the medieval 
 Abbey Farm. The church was also built 
 in this period. The Abbot was granted 
 rights to hold a market at Lenham in  
 the 14th. century. The association    
 between Lenham &amp; St. Augustine's      
 continued until Henry VIII's time. The
 market had ceased by the early 20th.  
 century but Lenham Square retains its 
 retail function.                      
  The street pattern of the centre of  
 Lenham dates from the 15th. century   
 and most of the buildings there are   
 earlier than 1830.
