		<content>  I get up at 7.30, have a shower and  
put on my school uniform. I have my    
breakfast :cereal with milk,toast and  
marmalade, with tea. I wash up and     
leave home at 8.30 to cycle to school. 
  I meet my friends and go into school 
for registration at 9.00. There are    
four morning lessons, each lasting 40  
minutes. The subjects I study are      
Maths,English,French,History,Chemistry 
and Physics. After two lessons there   
is a 15 minute break. Morning school   
ends at 12.35. Due to teachers'        
present industrial action, I cycle     
home for a snack lunch. School resumes 
at 1.35 with 3 more 40 minute lessons. 
  At 3.40 school ends.I do my homework 
for up to 3 hours.Then I watch TV,go   
to Youth Club,Scouts,play cricket or   
work for my Bronze Duke of Edinburgh   
Award.I go to bed at 10.00
