		<title>19ARCHAEOLOGY IN LECHLADE CTD</title>
		<content>   A lot of{artefacts}have been found, 
 mainly amber beads and saucer         
 brooches. The richest find was a solid
 gold brooch adorned with garnets. Its 
 value was Â£5000. Three swords, fifteen
 spearheads and numerous shield bosses 
 have come to light. Other artefacts   
 include buckets, pots, amulets,       
 spinning items and a variety of tools 
 and knives. The{Anglo Saxons}came to  
 the Lechlade area around 400 A.D.,    
 having probably followed the route of 
 the{RIVER THAMES}and an old Roman     
 Road. The{Anglo Saxon Chronicle}states
 that they captured Cirencester in 577 
 A.D., which means that they had       
 settled in Lechlade for well over a   
 century before raiding there.         
   Page twenty is an example of the    
 creative work which arose from the    
 excavation. Space demanded the poem   
 be cut.                               </content>
