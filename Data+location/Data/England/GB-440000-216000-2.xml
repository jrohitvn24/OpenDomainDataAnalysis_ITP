Akeman street farm has got 770 acres of
land. 500 To Wheat and Barley. 50 To   
hay for racehorses. 30 To oil seed     
rape. 100 To potatoes. 50 To sugar     
beet. The farm also has a 9 million    
gallon resevoir and some grassland.    
The farmer works to two seperate six   
year rotations to ensure healthy crops.
On the farm they grow sugar beet, when 
it's grown it's taken to a factory in  
Kidderminster and made into Silver     
spoon sugar.They also grow Maris Piper 
potatoes under the name of Combe       
selected potatoes. Mr.M.Green owns the 
farm but he has to pay rent to the     
Duke of Marlborough each year for the  
farm. We saw a truck come in for wheat.
In recent years Akeman Street Farm has 
tken over the other farms in the area.
