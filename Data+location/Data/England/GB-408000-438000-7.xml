		<title>07Our Blood Testing for Lead</title>
		<content>  We had to have our blood tested for  
 lead because too much lead in the     
 blood could affect the brain. Doctors 
 are afraid that the health of children
 living near busy roads could suffer.  
 First the nurse took a blood sample   
 from our thumb. She smeared the blood 
 onto a glass slide then put this slide
 into a special machine. This machine  
 was able to measure the proportion of 
 lead in the blood sample.             
 The blood was normal if the count was 
 35 or less. If it was higher than this
 a further sample of veinous blood was 
 taken from your arm and sent to the   
 hospital for more tests.              
 Pollution from car exhaust fumes is   
 the main cause of the problem in our  
 country today.                        
 We were chosen because our playground 
 was found to have a high lead dust    
 level in an earlier survey.           </content>
