		<title>07A DAY IN THE LIFE OF ME</title>
		<content>At 6:45 I get up and go downstairs for 
my breakfast. My sister gets up 5 or 10
minutes after me, so I try to eat my   
breakfast fast so that I don't have to 
sit with her. After breakfast I get    
dressed ready for School. At 8 oclock  
me, my sister and my mother set off for
Middleton Cheney. I don't go straight  
to School, I go to Chris Adkin's house.
This is so that I can walk to School   
with him. School starts at 9 oclock; we
all line up, then class by class we go 
in. We hang up our coats on the trolly 
and then walk into class. Our teacher, 
Mr Allen, tells us to be quiet. Mr     
Allen then calls the register. This is 
followed by assembly. After assembly we
study Maths, this is boring. I'm in the
first Maths Group. We usually have a   
mental arithmetic test; I usually get 6
 r 7 out of 10, rarely 10/10. After    
Maths is Playtime. (Cont: page 8).     </content>
