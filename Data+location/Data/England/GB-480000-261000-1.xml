		<content>There are 150 dwellings in Ecton built 
mainly of stone and brick. About one   
third were built before 1900 .Around   
20 houses were built as council houses.
Some are now owner occupied. Only      
infilling is now allowed but houses    
have to be built of stone. Bellinge,   
Blackthorn, Standens Barn and Rectory  
Farm have all been built during the    
last ten years and therefore the       
property is new.  Around Bellinge there
are flats, bungalows, terraced houses, 
detached and semi-detached houses. Most
of the property is 2 or 3 storey       
terraced houses and rented. Great      
Billing is an old village. Most of the 
property there is owned. It is quaint  
with cottages and period properties.
