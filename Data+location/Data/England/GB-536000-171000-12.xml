		<content>My school you could say, is big.       
It's name is Catford County School.    
Sometimes Catford Boys want to mix with
us, but we put up a fight and we win.  
I like some of my teachers. The lesson 
I have are English, Music, Science,    
Art, Geography, German, History,       
Needlework, Games, RE, Computer        
Studies. The lesson I like most is     
Maths, Game, History, the first        
floor is red the second floor is brown 
and the third floor is green,and there 
are about 50 classes on each floor.    
There is a park next to our school     
and it is called FORSTER PARK.         
School is very good for you because you
can get a job when you are older.
