		<title>02SHOPPING PRECINCT</title>
		<content> This small shopping precinct serves a 
 residential estate of Bassleton Court.
 It is primarily a"convenience"amenity 
 as there are no large companies here. 
 The unit is a nucleus of 5 shops and a
 pub comprising a newsagent,hairdresser
 grocer and baker.Our survey showed    
 that none of the shops has suffered   
 from vandalism or burglary during the 
 past 2 years_a reflection of the      
 social standards of the neighbourhood.
 The overall busiest day is Saturday,  
 the slackest being Thursday.The main  
 cause is the attraction of the weekly 
 town centre market about 3/4 of a mile
 away.Our survey also showed that most 
 business is transacted before lunch.It
 was also interesting to note that half
 the customers arrived by car although 
 it is a mainly local_serving amenity. 
 The main users were women except the  
 pub which showed 100% male patronage. </content>
