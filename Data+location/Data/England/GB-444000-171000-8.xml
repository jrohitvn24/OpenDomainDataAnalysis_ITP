		<title>08TRANSPORT (MOTORWAY M4)</title>
		<content> The opening of the Motorway has been  
 a distinct advantage to a farmer who  
 has developed a farm shop(479727) near
 the Motorway interchange,for which he 
 grows potatoes on his farm to the west
 He grows vegetables and 'pick your    
 own fruit' on fields adjacent to the  
 Motorway link.Winterbourne village is 
 revitalised by its proximity but it   
 has increased traffic on potentially  
 dangerously narrow roads. It has split
 farms and meant bridges often not     
 sufficently wide for today's          
 machinery;fields were cut causing two 
 hedges to be pulled up to amalgamate  
 the remnants with a larger field.The  
 danger of billowing smoke limits straw
 burning;rabbits breed on the verges   
 and escape through fencing to the     
 fields;hovering sparrowhawks search   
 for small mammals;and the hunt can't  
 risk its dogs running under traffic.  </content>
