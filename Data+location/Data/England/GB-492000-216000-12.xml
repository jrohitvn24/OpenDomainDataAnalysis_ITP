		<title>12A LOCAL ORCHARD</title>
		<content>The plums in the orchard start growing 
in August.There are 21 different types 
of plums trees.There are 20 acres of   
plum trees.The apples start to being   
eaten in September.There are 20 acres  
 of apples and 18 different types.     
Ladies pick the fruit because it is    
easier to get ladies rather than men.  
The shop opens at 9.30to 12.30 and     
1.30 to 5.00.The shop is open 7 days a 
week.                                  
In total there is about 7000 trees in  
the orchard.They sell about half a ton 
of fruit every day.                    
If the plums are bunched together then 
the fruit does not have enough room to 
grow its proper size so they have to   
pick some so they are spread out       
The orchad is 60 years old.The workers 
there enjoy there work alot.
