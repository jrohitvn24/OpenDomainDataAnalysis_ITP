		<content> Most of the houses are situated along 
 the B2068 road and the lane leading to
 the village hall, school and Lower    
 Hardres church. At this junction is   
 the Granville Inn and Forge. In the   
 lane is the entrance to Street End    
 Place a 1500 acre estate which        
 accommdates the cricket ground and    
 pavilion. Opposite the school is a    
 small green with seat and stone cross 
 bearing names of those who lost their 
 lives in the 1914-18 and 1939-45 wars.
 Near the church are boarding kennels  
 for cats. The timbered Old Farmhouse  
 once a medieval Hall House is the     
 oldest building in the village. To the
 north on the B2068 opposite a War     
 Memorial and seat is a lane leading to
 Nackington Church and farm. Further on
 are Police Traffic Offices, a Boys'   
 Grammar School and a Private Hospital,
 all 20th century builings.            </content>
