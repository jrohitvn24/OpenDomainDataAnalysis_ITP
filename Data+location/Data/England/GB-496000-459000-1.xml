		<content> The area surveyed lies in the parish  
 of Garton and contains the village.   
 The countryside lies on the southern  
 edge of the East Yorkshire Wolds about
 two miles North-West of Driffield.    
 Most of the area is occupied by south 
 facing slopes 150' to 400' above      
 sea-level. There is boulder clay and  
 gravel in the south and south-west to 
 high chalk wold land in the north.    
 The soil and the low rainfall make the
 area very suitable for intensive      
 arable farming. There is a small      
 amount of pig, sheep and beef         
 production. For much of the year the  
 huge arable fields are silent apart   
 from the drone of a distant tractor.  
 The very quiet village of Garton      
 contains 92 of the D-Block's 97 houses
 and farms. There is a fine, unusual   
 church, a small primary school and    
 three shops.                          </content>
