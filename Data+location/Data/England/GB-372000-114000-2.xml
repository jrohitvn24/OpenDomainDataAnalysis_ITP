		<title>02BLACKMORE VALE LOCAL HISTORY</title>
		<content>  Little mention of this area is found 
 in Domesday.Later it was part of the  
 Royal Hunting Forest of Gillingham and
 being crossed by many brooks was boggy
 -hence BLACKMOOR.The land was slowly  
 cleared and settled but still today is
 thinly populated. The lowering of the 
 level of the R.Stour in 1939 by 1m has
 improved drainage and lessened risk of
 floods.Except where an angling club   
 has fishing rights the brooks are     
 badly choked by weeds and dead trees  
  Many public footpaths cross the      
 area leading to footbridges over      
 the streams but they are little used  
 nowadays and difficult to follow.     
  Communication by hard-surfaced roads 
 is fairly adequate in this area but   
 isolated farms are a mile from a made 
 up road and need their own transport  
  Farmers use modern methods are hard- 
 working and make a comfortable living.</content>
