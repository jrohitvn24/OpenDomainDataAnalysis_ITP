		<title>08Footpaths in Morwenstow</title>
		<content> As  with most areas Morwenstow has its
 system of  public footpaths which link
 specific  places  in  the  most direct
 route allowing  for the natural lie of
 the land.   Each of  the  paths  has a
 number, there are 34 in Morwenstow and
 of these 13 are in the  southern  part
 of the parish.  One of them  No 4, the
 path from  Lee to  Shop is an  ancient
 highway and a very enjoyable walk with
 woodland and high ground sections.    
 Another impressive footpath to walk is
 No 1 the coastal path which is part of
 the North Cornwall Coastal path.  This
 path has very steep  sections  such as
 at Stanbury  mouth  but the scenery is
 magnificent at any time of the year.  
 Footpath No 5 is a beautiful walk from
 Burridge via Sanctuary to Coombe      
 passing down the lovely Coombe valley.
 The rich patterns of green and stark  
 greyness make this a special place.   </content>
