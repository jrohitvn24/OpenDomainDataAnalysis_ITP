		<title>14FARMS AND FARMING</title>
		<content>         We did a survey on farming and
                                       
 we rang up 14 people to ask them some 
 questions to find out for example how 
 old the farm is. Here are the         
 averages. The average age of the farm 
 was 194 years. The average age of the 
 farm house itself was 253 years. The  
 oldest house was 535 years old. For   
 how many cows they had the average was
 107. 2 people kept pigs: 1 had 3 and  
 the other 90. The beef cattle was     
 really high because 1 person had 1000 
 bulls and the average turned out to be
 322. On the crops 2 people kept it all
 for animals and 1 person sold it all. 
 3 people kept most of it. 4 people had
 barley, 4 people had wheat and 2      
 people had oats. The biggest farm is  
 350 acres, and the average was 138    
 acres.                                
                                       </content>
