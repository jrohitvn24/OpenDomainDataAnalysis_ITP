		<content> IF A ROAD SIGN SAYS 30 MPH AND YOU ARE
 GOING AT 40 MPH YOU CAN GET CAUGHT FOR
 BREAKING THE LAW.IN FRANCE THE POLICE 
 CARRY GUNS BUT OUR POLICE CARRY       
 TRUNCHEONS AND SMALL RADIOS.IN OUR    
 AREA THE POLICE RIDE IN POLICE VANS,  
 SOME HAVE DOGS IN THE BACK.IN OUR     
 VILLAGE WE USED TO HAVE TWO POLICE    
 HOUSES BUT THEY HAVE BEEN SOLD.OUR    
 POLICEMAN IS CALLED P.C.MARLOW,HE     
 HELPS US WITH CYCLING PROFICIENCY AND 
 TELLS US ABOUT THE HIGHWAY CODE.IF A  
 PERSON DOES SOMETHING WRONG HE HAS TO 
 GO TO THE MAGISTRATES' COURT IN       
 WIMBORNE.SOMETIMES THINGS ARE STOLEN  
 BUT THERE IS NOT MUCH CRIME IN THIS   
 BLOCK.
