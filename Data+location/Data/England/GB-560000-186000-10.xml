		<content>                                       
   Nearly every household in West      
 Horndon has a car ,because public     
 transport is infrequent and expensive.
 People need a car to go shopping      
 because in West Horndon you do not    
 have the choice of food and it is     
 expensive .There are no clothes shops.
 Most people also use it for pleasure  
 and transport to work.                
                                       
    There are bus sevices in the area  
 serving West Horndon and Bulphan. Two 
 buses go through West Horndon.They go 
 to Romford,Hornchurch,Upminister,     
 Craham, West Horndon, Laindon and     
 Baisildon and they go every hour.There
 is a bus to Bulphan a few times a day.
