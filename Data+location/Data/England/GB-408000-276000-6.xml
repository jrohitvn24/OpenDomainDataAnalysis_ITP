		<content>  Until recently the Shirley area,like 
 most areas in the West Midlands,had a 
 record of mainly full employment,to a 
 large extent in manufacturing         
 industries.A survey carried out of    
 representative families showed that   
 the depression of the early 1980s had 
 had a profound effect on employment in
 the area.There was a male unemployment
 rate of 10%,and a female rate of only 
 6%,the difference probably being      
 accounted for by the number of mothers
 taking part-time jobs such as school  
 cleaners.Of those in employment only  
 one person was employed in primary    
 industry (a gardener),whereas 32% were
 employed in secondary industry and 66%
 in tertiary industry.Over the last 5  
 years there had been a movement of 17%
 of workers from secondary to tertiary 
 industry,a clear sign of the decline  
 in manufacturing industry in the area.</content>
