		<title>07MUSEUM OF LINCOLNSHIRE LIFE</title>
		<content> The aim of the museum when it was     
 established was to picture the        
 agricultural, industrial and social   
 history of Lincolnshire from Elizabeth
 I to Elizabeth II.  The special       
 importance of the collections is      
 mainly on the 19th and early 20th     
 century.  The Lincolnshire Local      
 History Society are hoping to build up
 the collection with materials from the
 earlier periods as money becomes      
 available.                            
 The importance of the recent years    
 have been mainly items relating       
 agriculture, the most single factor in
 the history of Lincolnshire and the   
 one which has affected the lives of   
 Lincolnshire people more than any     
 other.
