		<title>10Medway Hospital</title>
		<content> Medway Hospital is within five minutes
 walk from our school. It is a major   
 accident and general hospital.        
 Medway Hospital is important because  
 you need it when you are hurt or need 
 treatment.                            
 Medway Hospital is important to me    
 because when my dad had a brain       
 haemorhage he went there for some     
 time. I live oposite it so when my    
 sister had a broken arm she did not   
 have to go far.                       
 There are loads of places in          
 hospitals.  For instance a waiting    
 room, casualty wards, operating       
 theatres, kitchens, private rooms,    
 laundry, pharmacy, teaching room,     
 childrens ward, mens and womens wards.
