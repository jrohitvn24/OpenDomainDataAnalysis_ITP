		<title>16DOMESDAY PLACE NAMES.</title>
		<content>  At the time of the original Domesday 
 Survey Wicklewood had two entries.    
 These were Wicklepuda and Wiclurde.   
  Hackford had almost the same sounding
 name,Hakeforda, as now.               
  Crownthorpe also had two entries.    
 These were Gonkethor and Congrethorpe.
 The King held the second settlement,  
 and it might be that this name changed
 to Crownthorpe because of the King's  
 crown,and the royal connections.
