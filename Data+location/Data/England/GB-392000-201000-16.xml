		<content>  We asked 44 people if they went to   
 Church where would they go and, not   
 surprisingly, 37 said St.             
 Kenelms,Sapperton. When we questioned 
 them more deeply we found that 6 of   
 them{never}went to Church, 8 went     
 regularly, 2 went less than 6 times a 
 year. 7 said they would only go for   
 funerals and weddings. We were sad    
 that so few of our sample would meet  
 Andrew Bowden, our Rector, on Sundays.
 Once a term the Village Primary School
 assist with the monthly  Sunday       
 morning Family Service and nearly all 
 the pupils attend and many parents.   
 The Rector takes a lesson at the      
 School almost every week.St. Luke's   
 Church,Frampton Mansell has recently  
 been rededicated after being closed   
 for a long time.Some villagers are    
 working very hard to restore it.The   
 Baptist Church is very well supported.</content>
