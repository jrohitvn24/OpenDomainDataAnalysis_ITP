		<title>09Ladywell Cottage.</title>
		<content> We went to Ladywell Cottage. At the   
 bottom of the steps there was a statue
 of Mary and a well. The well was      
 different from stone wells, this one  
 was square with no wall and the water 
 did not freeze in winter.A nun opened 
 a gate, she had some gardening tools  
 in her hands. She said "Go in the     
 garden and I'll tell you more about   
 the well. She said that Holy Child    
 nuns look after the cottage. Fergus   
 McGuire found the well. At sea he     
 heard someone say "find a well with a 
 crab apple tree in Ferryhalgh", he had
 never heard of the place. He went to  
 an inn and a maid said "Sorry I'm     
 late, my cow strayed to Ferry halgh". 
 He asked her where Ferryhalgh was. He 
 found the well and the tree and built 
 a statue.
