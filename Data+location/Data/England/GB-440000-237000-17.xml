		<title>17Broughton Castle:Banbury (1)</title>
		<content>Broughton Castle was built in {1300} as
a manor house and took about 10 years  
to build.                              
 In the {Civil War} of 1642 to 1649 it 
was used for the {headquarters of the  
Parliamentarians} against king         
Charles I.                             
 {Lord Saye} was one of the leaders of 
the Parliamentarians who gathered at   
Broughton Castle before the Civil War  
began to plot against the king. When   
the War started they had a regiment    
there. Lord Saye had his own {regiment 
of Bluecoats} and the regiment slept   
at Broughton Castle. The big roof      
space is still known as the {Barracks}.
So it was a garrison in the Civil War. 
After the Battle of Edgehill, the      
first battle in the Civil war, the     
Castle was {beseiged by the Royalists} 
and they surrendered. So it was        
captured.                              </content>
