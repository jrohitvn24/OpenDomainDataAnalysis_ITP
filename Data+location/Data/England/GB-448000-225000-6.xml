		<content> The village of Upper Heyford is       
 T-shaped with the main north-south    
 road following the short arm of the   
 T.Along this road are situated about a
 dozen  semi-detached council houses.  
                                       
                                       
 The long arm of the T runs downhill   
 from the main road with several old   
 stone houses  at the top of the hill. 
 Mid way down the hill are an old      
 granary and victorian school house    
 which have been converted to private  
 dwellings.Also four old stone         
 terraced houses.Some of the houses    
 have thatched roofs.                  
                                       
 At the bottom of the hill are four    
 more council houses and three large   
 detached houses which flank the canal.
 Three new houses are being built in a 
 cul de sac to the right of this hill. </content>
