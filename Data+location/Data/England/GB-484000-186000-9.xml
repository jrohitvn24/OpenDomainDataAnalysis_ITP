		<title>09My hopes and fears.</title>
		<content> I hope that my Mum and Dad get a pay  
 rise soon because they spend more     
 money on us than they do on           
 themselves. It would be more fair if  
 they spent more on themselves than    
 they do on us. My Mum and Dad might be
 able to pay the bills a bit quicker.  
 It would be good if my Mum and Dad got
 a big bonus on their birthdays and    
 other special occasions.              
 My fear for the future is that they   
 may be a nuclear war. I want to see   
 the world settle down to some serious 
 arms control talks.                   
 I hope that before long we will be    
 building a space station on the Moon  
 so that there will be a chance of     
 surviving a third world war.          
 I hope that before much longer all    
 cars will be electrically powered so  
 that our streets will no longer be    
 full of fumes.                        </content>
