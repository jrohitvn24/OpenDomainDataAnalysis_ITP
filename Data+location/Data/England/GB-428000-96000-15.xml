		<content>  The manual employees work a 39 hour  
 week whilst the 'white collar' workers
 do a 37\ hour week.Most of the workers
 are local with about 80 from the Isle 
 of Wight. They also employ Spaniards, 
 Asian and Indian workers and have both
 foreign training schemes and youth    
 apprenticeships.There are 16          
 apprentices &amp; many female engineers.  
 Every worker must belong to a union   
 and most are members of the "Transport
 and Genral Workers Union". In 2 years 
 there have been no redundencies.      
  The pistons and piston rings are made
 of aluminium and cast iron and range  
 in size from the largest comparable to
 a pedal bin to as small as a tea cup. 
 Approximately 50,000 are produced a   
 week and they are supplied to 16      
 different countries. The Ampress works
 were chosen as the site for the       
 research and developement unit in 1961</content>
