		<title>15Health Food Shop:Chatteris</title>
		<content>    About one third of the shops in    
 Chatteris sell different types of     
 food.'Country Store' is the name of a 
 health food shop in Chatteris which   
 opened on 24 August, 1984. The        
 premises are rented. The shop sells   
 cereal, flour, dried fruit, dairy     
 products, tinned foods, drink, herbs  
 and health sweets. The three most     
 popular items sold are cereals, cheese
 and herbs.                            
    The busiest days of the week are   
 Fridays and Saturdays. The owners     
 chose to open a shop in Chatteris     
 because they are local and know a lot 
 of people. None of the family had any 
 training or experience for the        
 business.                             
    After food shops the most common   
 are clothing, hairdressers, newsagents
 and confectioners and fast food shops.
 There is only one supermarket.        </content>
