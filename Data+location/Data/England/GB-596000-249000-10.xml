		<content>Aircraft flying too low and noise were 
the factors mentioned by 75% of those  
interviewed. However the employment the
Camp brings is appreciated.            
The general feeling was that a village 
shop would be an asset.                
Wattisham's village hall is too small  
to provide the leisure activities the  
people would like. A Youth Club and    
activities for the Senior Citizens     
figure prominently in the use of a new,
larger hall.                           
Although Wattisham has a strong Baptist
element there appears to be a straight 
split between those who feel that the  
Parish Church of St Mary's Bildeston is
justified  in their fund raising for   
the costly restoration of the Tower and
those who feel it should be raised for 
the Third World.
