 AND LEAD STRAIGHT OUT ONTO THE        
 ROAD.MANY OF THEM ARE BEAUTIFULLY KEPT
 AND HAVE BEEN MODERNISED COMPLETELY.  
 SOME NEW HOUSES BY TAY,COWEN AND      
 PERSIMMON HAVE BEEN OR ARE BEING BUILT
 NEAR THE TOWN CENTRE.SOME OF THESES   
 HOUSE ARE DETATCHED OTHERS ARE FLATS.

 MORE THAN THREE STORIES HIGH,THE      
 HIGHEST BUILDINGS BEING THE FLOUR MILL
 AND THE ABBEY.
