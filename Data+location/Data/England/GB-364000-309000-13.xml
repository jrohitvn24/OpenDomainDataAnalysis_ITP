		<title>13Sikh Customs</title>
		<content>  The Sikh baptism was first introduced
 in 1699.A special nectar of sugar and 
 water is made,stirred with a double   
 edged sword,while 5 baptised Sikhs    
 each say a prayer.5 palms full of     
 amrit are given to the adult novice.He
 or she is given the name'Singh'_(lion)
 or 'Kaur'_(princess).For the Sikh     
 bride,celebrations begin 2 days before
 the wedding.Oil and water are put on  
 the floor and a pattern is sprinkled  
 on top with flour.The bride sits on a 
 chair while her face is covered with  
 an orange mixture.On the day,the bride
 wears a red outfit,bangles and a ring 
 on every finger.The groom and his     
 relations (not his mother) meet the   
 bride and family at the Gurudwara.    
  After prayers,they walk around the   
 canopy 4 times.After a party,money is 
 pinned to their clothes.Later,they    
 leave,to return the next day.         </content>
