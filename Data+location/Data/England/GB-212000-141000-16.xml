		<title>16Lundy and the National Trust</title>
		<content> Lundy came onto the market in 1968.The
 National Trust were interested but    
 needed to raise Â£100,000.Three Devon  
 M.P's,Jeremy Thorpe,Peter Mills and   
 David Owen,led the campaign to save   
 Lundy for the nation.It was the       
 generosity of Jack Hayward,a British  
 millionaire living in the Bahamas,    
 who made the purchase possible.He had 
 previously enabled the rescue of      
 Brunel's S.S Great Britain and now    
 gave Â£150,000 to the National Trust so
 that the purchase could proceed.An    
 appeal by the Devon M.P.s raised a    
 further Â£100,000 to help towards      
 repairs.The Landmark Trust agreed     
 to administer the island and were     
 granted a 60 year lease.A programme of
 restoration and improvement is now    
 well under way and the future of the  
 island and its unique heritage seems  
 assured.                              </content>
