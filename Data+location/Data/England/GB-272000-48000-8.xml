		<title>08AVON MILL</title>
		<content> Avon Mill was one of the several water
 powered corn mills in the area. A leat
 ran from the River Avon to power the  
 water wheel.                          
 In 1962 the present owners took over  
 the mill and for a number of years    
 used the water wheel to provide       
 electricity for their plant nursery   
 business.                             
 Avon Mill Nursery and Garden Centre is
 now a thriving concern,employing three
 full time and two part time people.   
 Plants are grown to supply their own  
 shop in Kingsbridge, and about 1000   
 different trees, shrubs and plants are
 sold there and at the Garden Centre.  
 On the 4.5 acre site there are 10     
 greenhouses. Geraniums are the most   
 popular pot plant, with over 4000     
 grown each year. Garden equipment,    
 seeds, fertilizers, greenhouses,      
 sheds and garden ornaments are sold.  </content>
