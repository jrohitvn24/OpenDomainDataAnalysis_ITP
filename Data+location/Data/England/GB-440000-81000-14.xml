		<title>14BRIGHSTONE COASTGUARDS.</title>
		<content>  The coastguard station is just out of
 our area but they are responsible for 
 a long stretch of coast including our 
 block. In the nineteenth century the  
 coastguard service was primarily      
 concerned with the control of         
 smuggling but in 1854  they were given
 safety and rescue equipment. In the   
 next 53 years 9000 lives were saved   
 and they built up a reputation for    
 never failing to offer help.          
  Today 800 vessels a day go through   
 the Channel. Watch is kept mainly by  
 radar from the main stations at       
 Falmouth and Dover. Brighstone is an  
 auxilliary station but it still has 20
 men who have a practice drill twice a 
 month.                                
  One of the most useful items of      
 equipment is a pistol which can fire a
 rope up to a mile distant to haul     
 someone in.                           </content>
