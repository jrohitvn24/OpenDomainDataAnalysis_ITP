		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content>   Situated south of the Skelmersdale  
New Town the area, in the past was     
mainly rural with two Brickworks and   
several small coal mines with the Wigan
to Liverpool Railway running through   
the centre. It consisted of 3 villages 
- Digmoor, Holland Moor and Crawford - 
administered by the Up Holland U.D.C.  
   Today, still largely rural, Holland 
Moor and Digmoor have become densely   
populated areas of the New Town with an
Industrial Area attached. All the mines
are closed but one Brickworks remains  
open with imported clay. The Railway   
with its station, Up Holland, still    
operates but is supplemented by the M58
Motorway linking the M6 with the docks 
(container) at Bootle.                 
   The New Town area, hit by recession,
has very high unemployment. The rest is
good farmland, farmed profitably. West 
Lancashire D.C. is the local authority.</content>
