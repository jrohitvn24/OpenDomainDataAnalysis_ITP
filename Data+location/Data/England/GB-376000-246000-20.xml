<title>20Waste Disposal</title>
<content>

Things have moved on since the '80's, though some may feel it inverse progress. The incinerator has long since closed due to the fact that fumes did not meet modern standards, and Malvern Hills Council could not find the money to update it.&lt;br />&lt;br />All waste is now taken to landfill at Hill and Moor, just outside Pershore. However, such things as paper, metal and plastics are collected by the council for re-cyclimg, as is garden waste, for a small charge.&lt;br />&lt;br />The Link also now boasts a civic amenities site, where householders can dispose of their waste, which is sorted and re-cycled as far as possible.   &lt;br />  &lt;br />
