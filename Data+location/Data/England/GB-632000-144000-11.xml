		<title>11ST MARGARETS AT CLIFFE</title>
		<content> The community is physically split into
 2 villages. One is on the bay of St   
 Margarets the other is centred around 
 the church 1km in land. This is about 
 the second. The church existed in 1086
 when the Survey called it Sancta      
 Margarita. The present large building 
 is chiefly 12th century Norman.       
 Farming,fishing and smuggling appear  
 to have been the main occupations up  
 to 1865 when Lord Granville decided to
 develop the village as a holiday      
 resort. It became a quiet and select  
 retreat by the 1930's. The war saw the
 town taken over the military but      
 since 1945 the development of the     
 motor car has helped revive the       
 village. An R.A.F. station became a   
 holiday camp in 1960. This has        
 developed into the Country Club,a 55  
 unit,self_catering holiday village    
 with a pool,open to non_residents.    </content>
