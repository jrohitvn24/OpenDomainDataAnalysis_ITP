		<content> Rawcliffe Bridge is a small village   
 (pop 600) situated some six miles from
 the port of Goole in the west of the  
 county of Humberside. The surrounding 
 area forms part of the Vale of York,  
 is very flat and barely above sea     
 level. Until the 17th. century the    
 area was part of a vast marsh, but in 
 1626 a famous Dutch engineer,         
 Cornelius Vermuyden  reclaimed 24 000 
 acres by redirecting the River Don ten
 miles to the north and building a     
 system of dykes to feed the new man   
 made waterway. This river flows       
 through Rawcliffe Bridge. As well as  
 draining the land Vermuyden improved  
 the soil quality by systematic        
 flooding to create rich fertile 'warp'
 which is now high quality agricultural
 land.
