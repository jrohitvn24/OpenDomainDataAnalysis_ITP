		<title>03SOUTH HYLTON JOLLY BUS</title>
		<content> South Hylton is linked to the centre  
 of Sunderland by a privately owned bus
 service. The service was founded by   
 Mr.W.H.Jolly in 1923 and is now being 
 run by Mrs A.L.Jolly, his widow, and  
 his two sons Mr K.K.and Mr.M.L.Jolly. 
 Running originally half way to the    
 town the service was extended to the  
 town centre when the rail link ended  
 in 1964. The Jolly Bus is garaged in  
 South Hylton and employs 16 people.The
 people of the village rely on the     
 service. Buses begin running at 06.50 
 and the last bus leaves town at 23.20.
 Buses run at 15 min. intervals except 
 between 09.00 and 14.15 when they run 
 every 20 mins. Three buses are used to
 operate the service, each carrying    
 about 1,000 passengers a day. The     
 local Transport Executive were refused
 permission to take over the route.
