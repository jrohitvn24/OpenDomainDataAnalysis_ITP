		<content>{ The past few years} have seen changes
 in  Vauxhall.  Our neighbourhood, once
 packed with housing, crammed with life
 and  with  employment for most adults,
 presents  a  different picture  today.
{ Many factories,}including Tate &amp; Lyle
 sugar refinery  and  the  BXL plastics
 manufacturers,  have  closed  down.   
{ Much of the old housing}is demolished
 and the rest is being modernised. This
 was necessary  because the  old houses
 were  damp, had  cracks  in  walls and
 ceilings  and were infested with rats,
 mice and cockroaches. The vermin  were
 from  the sugar refinery's  buildings.
{ Because  of  unemployment  and  poor 
{housing} many  of  our  school friends
 have now moved away.  We  are  looking
 forward to being rehoused in this area
 as  there  are  exciting plans  by our
 community  to develop the  Tate &amp; Lyle
 site  for  housing  and  leisure.     </content>
