		<title>14Elton Fire Party</title>
		<content>  When the Derbyshire Fire Service was 
 set up in the 1940s basic fire fight- 
 ing equipment was provided in the     
 remoter villages to be used while     
 awaiting the arrival of appliances    
 from the nearest fire station. Later, 
 fire parties were formed and minimal  
 training was provided.                
  The fire box in Elton contains a hand
 siren, standpipe, turnkey, six hose   
 reels, nozzle and list of hydrants.   
  In 1983 fire party members prevented 
 a barn fire from spreading to nearby  
 properties.                           
  The fire party is to be disbanded in 
 1985. Appliances can reach the village
 in about twelve minutes from Matlock  
 and the authorities are concerned     
 about the danger of toxic fumes to    
 untrained volunteers.                 
  Elton has the last fire party in     
 Derbyshire and possibly in England.   </content>
