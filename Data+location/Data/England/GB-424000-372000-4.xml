		<content>    The Peak Park Planning Board will  
 not allow large scale developments    
 in the future. The most common new    
 buildings are extensions to existing  
 houses.                               
    Local sandstone is the most common 
 material and natural slates are used  
 to match. Fibre glass and double-     
 glazing  reduce heat loss. Central    
 heating systems using gas, solid fuel 
 or oil are usually fitted in new      
 buildings. A new North Sea gas pipe-  
 line is being constructed to supply   
 the growing demand.                   
    House prices are usually 10% higher
 than in other local villages. A three-
 bedroom house would cost about        
 Â£45,000. Bungalows being built in     
 Baslow are priced at about Â£85,000.
