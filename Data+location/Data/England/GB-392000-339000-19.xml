		<title>19INTERVIEW WITH MRS L.LEESE</title>
		<content>   Mrs.Leese is a local resident who   
is aged 85."In 1930s there was a       
depression prior to World War 2.I      
worked in the Leek Silk Mill.I left    
home at 6.00am for the train to Stoke  
and on another train to Leek(returning 
at 7.00pm.)I got 2 guineas per week(6  
days per week.)Village life focussed   
on the church.Sunday consisted of going
to the Church of England which was very
primitive but enjoyable.Also we had a  
girls' club and on Mayday we platted a 
Maypole on the Vicarage lawn.There were
2 pubs,The Dusty Miller and The Wind-  
mill,and a shop where Deryn's Hair-    
dressers is now.I had 4 brothers and   
4 sisters-Luther,Lewis,Leonard and     
Lemual.My sisters were called Levison, 
Lavinia,Lillian and Ledicia.By 1939 the
airfield was a training centre.I also  
worked on a farm where we started 6.30 
am.and worked until 9.30pm.at Harvest."</content>
