		<title>01The Chelmsley Wood Area</title>
		<content> The dominant feature of the area is   
 the overspill estate of Chelmsley Wood
 which was built in the 1970's to      
 accomodate people from the inner city 
 areas of Birmingham. The estate was   
 built to high density specifications  
 but with a variety of housing styles  
 and with both private and council     
 accomodation. The estate is self      
 sufficient as far as services are     
 concerned and has a large shopping    
 centre although there is little       
 provision for industry. To the south  
 of the area is the smaller settlement 
 of Marston Green, once a small village
 but now swallowed up as part of the   
 sub-urban area of Birmingham. To the  
 north and s.east much of the land is  
 still farmland; predominantly mixed.  
 This land is under pressure for       
 development.This is in part due to its
 proximity to the M6 &amp; M42 motorways.  </content>
