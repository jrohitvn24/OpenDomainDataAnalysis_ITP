		<title>09Georgeham Church</title>
		<content>   It is believed that Georgeham church
 was first built in 1231.Since then    
 there have been 45 rectors starting   
 with Robert de Edington to the presant
 rector Bernard John Bedford Carr.He's 
 been there since 1974.There is none of
  the church built in 1231 left        
 because it was completly rebuilt in   
 1762.                                 
   All stain glass windows are in      
 memory of someone. The oldest one was 
 put up in 1866.There are also many    
 plaques put up in the church          
 commemorating people.There are 33     
 pipes in the organ.Because in 1231    
 there were no newspapers all          
 important facts were put on plaques   
 in the church such as the comet in    
 1680.                                 
   The church is painted in quiet      
 colours and is quiet itself.
