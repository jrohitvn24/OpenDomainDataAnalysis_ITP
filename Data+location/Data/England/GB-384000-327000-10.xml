		<title>10WALTON HALL SPECIAL SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Walton Hall School caters for         
 Staffordshire children with moderate  
 learning difficulties.  Several also  
 have behavioural problems.  The local 
 Education Authority funds the school. 
 The procedure of admitting a child    
 oftens takes a year.  It is the only  
 special school in the County that has 
 residential places for girls.         
 The School opened in 1948 with 48     
 girls in one house, in 1971 it became 
 a mixed day school for 5-16 year-olds.
 Now there are 101 pupils (10 boys and 
 15 girls are residents) and 10        
 teachers.  There are 25 other staff:  
 housemothers, cooks, kitchen help and 
 caretaker.  Boarding children rise at 
 7.30am, school starts at 9.00am and   
 ends at 3.25pm.  Several children     
 travel by taxi.  Residential children 
 go home for the weekend on Fridays.
