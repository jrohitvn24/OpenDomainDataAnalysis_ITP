		<content>  In Summertime we usually have the    
 School Fete. This year we had a{      
{Victorian Country Fair.}We danced     
 around the Maypole, sang Victorian    
 songs like "Oh I do like to be beside 
 the Seaside", had sideshows and       
 dressed up as Victorians. Nearly      
 all the children in the school        
 were in costume.There was also a      
 display of Victorian things like      
 books, pictures, clothes, samplers and
 even an old school desk.              
                                       
  It was twenty five years ago that the
 villagers first opened the Playing    
 Fields, so there was an{Anniversary   
{Celebration}with football matches,    
 clay pigeon shooting, obstacle course 
 and a barbecue. It was opened by a    
 local celebrity and went on all day,  
 until the football tournament ended.
