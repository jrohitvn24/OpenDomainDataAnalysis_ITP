		<content> The present Clay Cutters Arms dates   
 from 1606.Previously it was a         
 Gentleman's House which later was made
 into 3 cottages where lived important 
 men who worked in the Clay works.This 
 building was destroyed in a fire and  
 the present Clay Cutters was          
 built.During the Civil War Charles 1  
 hid in the Clay Cutters to avoid      
 Oliver Cromwell.Legend has it that    
 the Clay Cutters is haunted by a      
 Cavalier.                             
          The present building is made 
 of cob,oak timbers and a thatched     
 roof. It became a listed building in  
 1985.
