		<content> The school was modernised in 1965.    
 There are inside toilets, 2 classrooms
 and a hall. There are{12 infants}and  
{11 junior}children in the school. When
 the children are 10 years old they go 
 to Scissett Middle School.            
 The school has a playground at the    
 front and a playing field at the back.
 Meals are prepared at the school. They
 are cook/chill meals.                 
 There are{2 full time teachers}and a  
 part time teacher.                    
 We do all sorts of things at school.  
 Besides Maths and English, we paint   
 and model using clay, balsa and other 
 materials. We have PE and games and   
 now have a BBC computer. On Thursday  
 all the juniors go swimming. In summer
 we join other primary schools in a    
 sports day.
