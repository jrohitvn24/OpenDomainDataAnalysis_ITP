		<content>  In this area most of the houses are  
 old houses which have been modernised.
 On the edge of the common the houses  
 were originally squatters cottage,    
 that means the people had to build the
 chimmney in order to have the         
 right to stay there. They were built  
 from uncut stones from the hill.      
 Nowadays they have been built on and  
 modernised or left to fall down. Other
 cottages have been modernised. At     
 Doddington and Hopton Bank new houses 
 have been built on land belonging to  
 small farms.                          
 In Hopton village there are some new  
 houses where business people who      
 travel to Birmingham live.            
 The biggest house is the old Manor    
 House which is built in Georgian      
 style. Most of the houses have mains  
 electricity and water but they have   
 their own sewage tank.               .</content>
