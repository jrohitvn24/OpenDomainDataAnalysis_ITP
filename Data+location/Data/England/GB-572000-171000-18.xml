		<title>18FRUIT FARMING</title>
		<content> Th area in the south western half of  
 the survey block lies in a shallow    
 hollow facing south. This plus the    
 light sandy soil makes it a           
 particulary good area for fruit       
 growing. The westerly edges of the    
 fruit growing area can easily be      
 identified by the tall rows of poplars
 and alders grown as windbreaks. The   
 easterly edges are afforded some      
 protection by the chalk escarpment.   
 Mockbeggar Farm lies in the centre of 
 the area. At Mockbeggar they grow some
 70,000 fruit trees. They grow some    
 eight different varieties of apples   
 such as Bramley,Laxton,Granny Smith   
 and Worcester and three different     
 types of pears,Cornice,William and    
 Conference. They also grow a number of
 varieties of plums eg.Margery         
 Seedling. Also in the orchards can be 
 seen Mayless or crab apple trees.     </content>
