		<title>08MY FAMILY LIFE</title>
		<content>   My family life is different to most 
 people because my dad doesn't live    
 with me.                              
   I see him most days, Monday,        
 Wednesday, Thursday and Sunday.       
 Sometimes he will see me when he does 
 not go to work on Saturday and he will
 take me down town and buy something.  
   He works every day except Sunday.   
 On Sundays he will come to see me play
 football for my Sunday League team or 
 watch me play tennis.                 
   My mum goes to work as a dinner lady
 at mid-day and then works as a cleaner
 in the evening.                       
   My brother is nine years old and    
 goes to primary school.  I am in the  
 second year at secondary school.      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
