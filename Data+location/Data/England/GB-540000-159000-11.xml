       Downe Scout Camp is a very big  
 centre for outdoor recreation.  The   
 London Rovers started the camp in     
 1929.  The camp covers 86 acres.      
 there is an assault course, and a     
 swimming pool there.                  
       Scouts and guides from all over 
 the world use this camp, but mostly   
 visitors from abroad are Europeans.   
 Each year 32,000 people use the camp. 
 It is open in the winter when nearly  
 every weekend a hundred people stay,  
 mostly in bunk houses.                
       The manager runs the scout camp 
 with one full-time assistant and lots 
 of voluntary workers.  One of the     
 improvements he would like to see is  
 an indoor swimming pool.  The existing
 outdoor pool holds 78,000 gallons and 
 was opened by Lord Baden-Powell.      </content>
