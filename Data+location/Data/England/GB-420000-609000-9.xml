 is at Alnwick,three miles away.In the 
 fire station there are two fire       
 tenders.There are{4 crews}of{7 men,   
 which makes a total of 28.Of each 7,  
 only 5 men are called out in an       
 emergency and 2 remain at the station.
 The maximum speed is{35 to 40 MPH.}on 
 country roads and it takes from 5 to 6
 minutes to reach Lesbury.They are able
 to pump water under pressure onto the 
 flames. The tenders are manufactured  
 by{D.A.F.}They carry equippment for   
 freeing people from vehicles,as they  
 are often called out to motor         
 accidents.They have recently changed  
 their name from the Fire Brigade to   
 the{Fire and Rescue Service}in 1984.
