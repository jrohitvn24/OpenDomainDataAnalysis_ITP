		<content> There are two small private housing   
 estates and one council estate which  
 contains some sheltered housing.There 
 are 4 1890's/1900 terraces.Preesall   
 and Pilling contain older properties  
 but with modern post-war in-filling   
 especially on Pilling Lane.Many of the
 farm houses are old and on ancient    
 sites and will repay a visit.We have  
 included two houses:                  
 1Parrox Hall (03600478) was built by  
 Richrd Fleetwood in 1656.It is open to
 the public on Gardeners' Sunday.It is 
 owned by the Elletsons,Squires of     
 Preesall since the time of King John. 
 2Cocker's Dyke (03760496) dates from  
 1629.Legend has it that the roof is   
 older than the walls.Cobblestone walls
 are typical of the Fylde.The house    
 contains a buttery chamber and main   
 living area and is 2 feet narrower at 
 upper bay than at the service room end</content>
