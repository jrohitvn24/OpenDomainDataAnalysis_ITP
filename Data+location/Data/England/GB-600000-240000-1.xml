		<title>01General Review - Hadleigh</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
The majority of the block is covered by
arable farmland with most of the large,
ancient farms concentrating on wheat,  
barley,sugar beet and oil seed rape.   
                                       
In the south-east corner lies the small
village of Layham. Most of the houses  
lie to the east of the R.Brett on      
higher ground, and around the road     
joining Hadleigh to the main A12 road. 
The old village centre, Hall, church   
and Post Office, is west of the Brett. 
                                       
To the north-east is the small market  
town of Hadleigh (pop.6,000). This is  
mostly residential but there are a few 
local industries.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
