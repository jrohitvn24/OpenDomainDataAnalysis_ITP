		<content> The original part of the{Anglican     
{Church,}St. Michael and all Angels was
 built in 1829. The building holds 300 
 people. There is a Deaconess and a    
 Curate who help the Vicar. The first  
 graveyard is near this church, and was
 also used by non-conformists. The     
{Methodist Church}was built in 1909    
 with bricks made in Verwood, the      
 minister cares for several churches in
 the area. The first{Congregational    
{Church (now the U.R.C.)}was built in  
 1802, a second building replaced it in
 1878 and was also used as a school, so
 the need arose for a third building   
 which was opened in 1906. The minister
 is shared with neighbouring villages, 
 with deacons assisting. The{Bethel    
{Chapel}was opened in 1931 after years 
 of worshipping in a hut at Haywards   
 Farm.{Roman Catholics}worship in      
 Ringwood and West Moors.              </content>
