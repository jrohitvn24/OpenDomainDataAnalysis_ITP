		<content>{Creep Mouse}is a game for 5 - 6       
 players.What you have to do is one    
 person is ON  and the rest have to    
 line up about 20 feet away. Then the  
 one who is ON  turns his/her back on  
 the rest and they have to try and     
 creep up to him. But the one who is ON
 turns around and if he/she sees some_ 
 one move that person has to go back to
 the beginning. If one gets up to him  
 he says "Creep Mouse". This can also  
 be called Pussy behind the curtain.   
{Bobs and Excuses}- this game is for as
 many people you like, the more the    
 better. It is like a game of touch but
 you have bobs and excuses. Bobs are   
 just crouching down and excuses are   
 'I've hurt my leg'.You start off with 
 5 and you have to say 2 bobs and 3    
 excuses. If you are caught and you    
 have run out of bobs and excuses you  
 are ON.                               </content>
