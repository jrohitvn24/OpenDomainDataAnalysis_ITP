		<title>13A DAY IN MY LIFE-AFTERNOON</title>
		<content> On the field after lunch, my friends  
 and I usually play football.  English,
 French and Music follow the lunch     
 break.  At last the bell sounds for   
 the end of school.  There is a dash   
 for the doors as school children flood
 out.  As soon as I reach home I dash  
 upstairs and change into my shorts.  I
 help my mother to tidy up toys which  
 have been scattered about the floor.  
 I then go out to play cricket with my 
 friends.  Tea is at 5pm and consists  
 of sandwiches, crisps and a biscuit.  
 After tea I play cricket again.  When 
 I arrive back my mother has gone to   
 work in the local restaurant and I put
 the babies to bed.  I will usually    
 watch some television before going up 
 to bed and reading.  An account of a  
 typical school day.                   
                                       
                                       </content>
