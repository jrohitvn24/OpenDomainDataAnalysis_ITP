		<title>09The Minster Lecterns</title>
		<content> There are two lecterns in Southwell   
 Minster, one in the choir and one in  
 the nave. Lecterns are brass eagles,  
 standing on a brass ball which has a  
 stand. The one in the choir came from 
 the bottom of a lake, baeause{Henry   
{VIII}wanted all the monasteries to be 
 taken down. The monks of{Newstead     
{Abbey}threw their treasures into the  
 lake. Later on it was one of the      
 treasures picked up from the bottom of
 the lake. It was then put in a shop   
 and someone bought it for the Minster.
 The one in the nave was only bought   
 from a shop, it had no history behind 
 it. Then we went to the pulpit. The   
 pulpit is where the priests preach.   
 They stand there so the people can see
 them and there is a microphone so     
 people can hear them.
