		<title>09The Lollipop Lady</title>
		<content> Our lollipop lady has been here for   
 17 years.She said that she likes her  
 job because she likes children,meeting
 people who are passing and being      
 outdoors.She got the job through our  
 local police man.She helps the        
 children across the road when they go 
 to school. There is no special        
 training but she goes to a seminar    
 every year.She has to wear special    
 clothes like gloves and a coat.They   
 are waterproof,reflective and luminous
 so drivers can see her clearly.She    
 carries a stick that looks like a big 
 lollipop that says "STOP-CHILDREN".She
 is here four times a day which is very
 tying but she has never let us down.  
 She is always there in all weathers to
 help the children across the road.She 
 does not like it when children don't  
 do as they're told or when people park
 their cars in the wrong place.        </content>
