		<title>01The Glynn Valley</title>
		<content> From east to west, the main road (A38)
 runs into Cornwall along the Glynn    
 Valley, mimicking the Serpentine      
 coarse of the river Fowey: while on   
 the opposite bank, the Paddington to  
 Penzance railway line sweeps along the
 shoulder of the valley, carried in    
 places, high above the ground on great
 viaducts.  The Glynn Valley is a      
 ribbon of woodland that gives pleasure
 to the travellers, russet hues of     
 autumn leaves, tinted sunlight in     
 summer and woodland daffodils and blue
 bells.  But it is probably as a mafor 
 thoroughfare that the valley has      
 always had most importance, guarded in
 ancient times by Largin Castle with   
 its great earth walls and commanding  
 views along the vallye.  A public     
 house and an out-of-town shopping     
 centre are the only public            
 establishments in the valley.         </content>
