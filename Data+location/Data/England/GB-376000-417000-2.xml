		<title>02SCHOOLS - STUBBINS/EDENFIELD</title>
		<content>  In our area there are two schools.   
 One is{Stubbins County Primary},and   
 the other is{Edenfield Church of      
{England Primary}.                     
  Our present school building is only  
 15 years old,but the school was       
 originally founded in 1868 in an old  
 stone building nearby.In our school   
 there are 140 children in six classes.
  Edenfield C.E. Primary School is over
 100 years old,and is still in its     
 original building at the northern end 
 of the village.There are 90 children  
 in four classes.                      
  When they reach the age of 11 most   
 children from both schools transfer to
 the High School in Haslingden 3 miles 
 away,though some children also go to  
 schools in Ramsbottom,Bury,Bolton,    
 Blackburn or Accrington.
