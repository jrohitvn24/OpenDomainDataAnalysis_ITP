		<content>     There is an active group in the   
area for people interested in vintage  
machinery, called The Manifold Valley  
Bygones Group.  The group used to meet 
at the Greyhound pub in Warslow but,   
due to an increase in the membership,  
the group now meet at The Countryman   
in Newtown.                            
     At the meetings, on the last      
Thursday of every month, members       
discuss rallies and their engines,     
and have slide shows.                  
     Most members own stationary       
engines like Listers, Petters and      
Wolseleys.  These engines are used to  
drive old farm machinery like pumps,   
sharpeners and saws, or to generate    
electricity.  Other members own old    
cars, tractors, motorbikes and ploughs.
     The group organises rallies       
themselves and  members attend other   
local rallies with their machines.     </content>
