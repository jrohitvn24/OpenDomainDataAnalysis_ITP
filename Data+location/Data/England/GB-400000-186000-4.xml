		<title>04S/COMMON SHOOTING FERRETING</title>
		<content>    In Somerford Common and surrounding
 area Shooting is rented from the      
 Forestry Commission. There is a       
 syndicate of nine guns and a full time
 Gamekeeper patrols the Common almost  
 daily. There are 370 acres and a lot  
 of work has been done in the 1980's to
 clear paths through the woodland and  
 keep them clear.                      
    In 1985 200 pheasants were reared  
 and put down in the Common. During the
 seasons approximately 100 pheasants   
 are shot.                             
    The Gamekeeper also arranges       
 ferreting and clay pigeon shooting.   
 Farmers also raise their own pheasants
 and enjoy the sport of shooting.      
    The local community do not ming    
 these activities.
