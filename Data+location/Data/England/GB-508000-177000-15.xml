		<title>15Bourne Avenue</title>
		<content> On the way to Bourne Avenue we passed 
 a field under a bridge where there    
 were horses, goats and donkeys.  At   
 the beginning of Bourne Avenue there  
 was an old peoples home.  It was      
 mainly semi-detached and terraced     
 houses. The road wasn't very busy and 
 it was people aged 40 and over who    
 lived in the houses.  The air smelt   
 clean and there wasn't many cars along
 the pavement.  At the end of Bourne   
 Avenue there was a general store and a
 pub and wine bar.  Right at the end   
 was a record office.  All of the roads
 leading off were built up with houses 
 apart from the one that lead to       
 Pinkwell Park.
