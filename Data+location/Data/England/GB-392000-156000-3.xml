		<title>03HOUSING - NEWHURST GATE</title>
		<content> In the summer of 1977 my husband and I
 moved our mobile home to Newhurst to  
 settle amongst farmers and small-     
 holders. Working only 5-1/2 miles away
 at Seend in a family business enabled 
 us to embark on a near impossible task
 of completely renovating our farm     
 cottages on a 1/3 acre Â£9,000 plot.   
 The hours spent, evenings and weekends
 for 3 years, often in freezing con-   
 ditions, filled us with a little pride
 and an investment worth Â£55,000. Now  
 we have a daughter of 5yrs; a thriving
 fine arts business, and our final     
 project is to purchase 2.5acres       
 (Â£8,000) upon which we plan, with aid 
 from local conservation and forestry  
 authorities,to fence,plant and install
 a wildfowl pond; to provide ground    
 for grazing stock and to replace      
 native species, elms which in the 60's
 were decimated by Dutch Elm disease.  </content>
