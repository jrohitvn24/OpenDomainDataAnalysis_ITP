		<title>06THE PEOPLE OF BRANCEPETH</title>
		<content> Despite the development of 3 small    
 exclusive housing estates, most people
 do not think the village has lost its 
 "olde" world charm.They all liked the 
 peacefulness and without exception    
 were sad the cricket field had        
 gone.There are no shops and some      
 people would like one for convenience 
 foods.There is a post office in the   
 gatehouse of the castle which sells   
 sweets, eggs and potatoes. Most shop  
 in Durham and travel by car.Their     
 favourite part of Brancepeth was the  
 churchyard and the castle grounds.One 
 man was upset at recent developments  
 saying that it had killed the village 
 atmosphere.The castle houses students 
 from Durhan University who liked the  
 idea of living in a castle.They get on
 well together but they thought the    
 villagers very "snooty".
