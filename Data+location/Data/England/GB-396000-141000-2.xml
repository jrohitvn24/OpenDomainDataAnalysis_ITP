		<content> A main east-west B class road links   
 Chitterne to the market town of       
 Warminster eight miles to the west,   
 and to Shrewton, a larger village to  
 the east. An unclassified road joins  
 villages from north to south.         
 Electricity and telephone lines are   
 mounted on pylons and posts along the 
 valley from Codford. Mains water was  
 brought into Chitterne only in 1969   
 and a few dwellings remain on private 
 supplies from good wells. There is no 
 mains drainage. The County Council    
 provides a mobile library fortnightly,
 rubbish collection weekly; verges are 
 cut twice in summer and roads are     
 salted and gritted in freezing        
 weather. There is no street lighting  
 either in the village of Chitterne or 
 in the connecting roads.
