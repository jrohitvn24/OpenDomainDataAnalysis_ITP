		<title>10PRIZE COWS</title>
		<content> We looked at the Silage Bays,only one 
 was full, as the weather has been so  
 dry this year the grass has not grown.
 Outside were eight heifers that had   
 been transplanted with eggs from a    
 prize cow.The young calves had green  
 tags in their ears.Green is the colour
 for 1985.We were given a handful of   
 cattle food it consisted of maize and 
 cattle cake for roughage;concentrated 
 sugar beet for energy;consentrated    
 Linseed Oil for protein.The cows also 
 eat grass in the Summer and silage and
 hay in the Winter.A normal Fresian cow
 gives 25 to 30 litres of milk a day,  
 but their prize cows give 52 litres a 
 day.                                  
 STOP PRESS_Since our visit we've heard
 that the cows won Five First Prizes;  
 Several Second Prizes and the Supreme 
 Championship Runner Up at the Royal   
 Agricultural Show.                    </content>
