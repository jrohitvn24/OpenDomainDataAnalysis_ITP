		<title>17HOUSING ESTATES</title>
		<content> Many of the old houses in our area    
 were part of the Ancaster Estate.     
 Three farm houses in the Scotland Lane
 area were part of these estates.  Most
 of the houses are now privately owned 
 or lived in by tenant farmers.One of  
 the houses known as Red Hill Farm was 
 built in 1822.                        
 The land and buildings still owned by 
 the Ancaster Estate are now to the    
 south of our area in Bulby, Edenham   
 and Bourne.
