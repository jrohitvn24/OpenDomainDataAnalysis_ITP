		<title>11Stetchworth Traditions</title>
		<content> Our only tradition in Stetchworth is  
 on May Day.Children used to go round  
 with a wreath of May flowers and knock
 on people's doors and sing a song.They
 would be given money.Now every year   
 the children in the infant class at   
 Stetchworth act out a short play about
 Winter giving way to Spring.After the 
 play the infants give out flowers they
 have bought in.They also go to Jubilee
 Court,the old people's home,and act   
 the play. Instead of giving flowers to
 them there they leave them on their   
 doorstep. After the play they sing a  
 song which is the same each year but  
 is not the song which used to be sung 
 in the village.
