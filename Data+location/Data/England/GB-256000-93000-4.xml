		<content> The town has two pedestrian precincts 
 Red Lion Yard (built on the site of a 
 public house which was knocked down,  
 hence the name). Red Lion Yard is     
 shown in the pictures. The other      
 pedestrian precinct is the Arcade,    
 built 80 years previously. The Arcade 
 has a Victorian domed roof covering   
 such shops as Field and Stream selling
 guns and fishing tackle, two shoe     
 shops, a tobacconists, camera shop and
 newsagents. Red Lion Yard is open to  
 the weather, being built in a modern  
 style. A narrow alley from Fore Street
 opens out into a large court yard. The
 shops around include a sports shop, a 
 record shop, a bakers, a video shop   
 and the only wine bar in the          
 Okehampton area.
