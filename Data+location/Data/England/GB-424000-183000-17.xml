		<content> There are about 107 houses in Ashbury,
20 in Idstone and 166 in Bishopstone   
and we found that most houses are brick
built with a tiled roof .However old   
houses are built of chalk and sarsen   
with a thatch roof . The chalk and     
sarsen stones were found locally .     
Sarsen was used for foundations        
and lower walls because it did not     
let water in and did not crumble       
like chalk .The edge of chalk walls    
was often finished with red bricks     
especially round the windows.In        
Bishopstone we noticed that many of the
thatch houses have a pebble dash cover 
to the chalk stone .It is possible to  
see beams in the walls of one or two   
old thatch houses . .Some of the older 
brick houses were roofed with slate .  
Newer brick houses are often cement    
rendered or painted and have tiles on  
the roof .                             </content>
