		<content> We were suprised to find that the     
 burning of straw following the harvest
 did not arouse a great deal of local  
 comment. This depite the fact that in 
 recent years the burning of stuble has
 been highly controversial with many   
 people actively campaigning to        
 control it.                           
                                       
 Amongst the older retired people there
 are also problems of getting to the   
 shops. Although there are some general
 stores they do not suuply all the     
 peoples needs and most people have to 
 get into Romsey or perhaps Salisbury  
 for their shopping. There is a bus    
 service along the main A27 Salisbury  
 to Romsey road. However, getting to   
 the road is not always easy.
