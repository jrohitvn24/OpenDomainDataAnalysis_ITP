		<title>17ALFRED BRAMWELL</title>
		<content> Alfred Bramwell was Headteacher at the
 Wesleyan Day School in Snaith form    
 1881 to 1921.                         
 On July 29th 1920 he recorded in the  
 school log book that a circus had     
 visited the town and that he had      
 dismissed the children early. His     
 handwriting was clear as usual. The   
 next entry on July 15th shows a marked
 change of control. The shakiness      
 persists until on April 4th 1921 we   
 are informed of Mr Bramwell's sudden  
 and tragic death.                     
 There is a story told that his wife   
 took to her bed many years before as a
 result of difficulties with their son 
 and immediately Alfred passed away,   
 rose from her bed.                    
 Alfred's portrait can be seen in the  
 local Methodist Chapel.
