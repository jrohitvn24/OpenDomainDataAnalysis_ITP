		<title>06Watford: Scammells</title>
		<content> Scammells is one of the biggest lorry 
 manufacturers in Great Britian. Each  
 lorry costs from Â£45000 to Â£150000.   
 They send some of their lorries       
 abroad to foreign countries but keep  
 some of their lorries in Great        
 Britian. Scammells also send some of  
 their lorries to Iraq where a war is  
 going on.                             
 The factory covers an area of 6.5     
 acres and employs 750 people.         
 The factory is owned by British       
 Leyland and produces 6 to 7 lorries   
 a day. Scammell also produces vehicles
 for the Army. Their latest vehicle to 
 go on the road is the Commander Tank  
 Carrier.
