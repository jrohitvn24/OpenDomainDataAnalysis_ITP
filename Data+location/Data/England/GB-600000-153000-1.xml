		<title>01Badlesmere : Introduction</title>
		<content> This bloc covers four Parishes, namely
 Badlesmere, Leaveland, part of        
 Sheldwich to the North and East and   
 part of Molash in the South-East      
 corner.  It is situated on top of the 
 North Downs, between 90 and ll5 metres
 above sea level, exposed to strong    
 westerly winds with a higher rainfall 
 than either Ashford or Faversham.     
 Spring is about two weeks later than  
 in Faversham.  The soil type is clay  
 with flints over chalk on the higher  
 ground and brick earth around         
 Badlesmere and Sheldwich.  It is a    
 rural area with large tracts of farm  
 land, beech woods and mixed coppices  
 sparsely populated in scattered       
 farmsteads and small concentrations   
 along the A251 and Badlesmere Lees.   
 Lack of amenities is the predominant  
 characteristic of the area.
