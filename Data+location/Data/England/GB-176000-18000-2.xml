		<title>02OUTSIDE COVERACK</title>
		<content> Being part of the Lizard platform the 
 land above and behind the village is  
 generally flat, with gentle rolling   
 slopes and open valleys. The area is  
 criss-crossed by a network of very    
 narrow, unclassified roads, in places 
 only wide enough for one vehicle. The 
 exceptions to this are the Helston/St.
 Keverne road and its branch off to    
 Coverack, which are B class roads.    
 Except for the village of Coverack    
 habitation is sparse and scattered,   
 with small hamlets and isolated       
 farmhouses. With the introduction of  
 modern technology on the farms and the
 consequent decrease in the number of  
 form workers many of the older houses 
 and farm buildings which, in the past 
 were part of the agricultural scene,  
 have been modernised and converted for
 use as homes for people outside the   
 farming community                     </content>
