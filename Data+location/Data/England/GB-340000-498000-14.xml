		<title>14Trade - Local shopping.</title>
		<content> While the prices charged in Windermere
 shops reflect the influence of        
 tourism, especially in the summer,    
 there has not been the growth in the  
 number of shops which could be called 
 "tourist-orientated" that  there has  
 been in nearby Bowness. Apart from the
 new Tourist Information Bureau near   
 the station, there are only 2 shops   
 which sell local'gifts' out of the 70 
 or so shops in the village. The eleven
 cafes/restaurants, more than might be 
 expected, depend a great deal on the  
 tourist trade however, and most close 
 in the winter. 20% of the shops sell  
 food and banks and building societies 
 are well represented. A random        
 selection of the others includes 3    
 solicitors, launderette, 2 bakers,    
 4 antique shops, 2 shops selling      
 kitchen equipment, a wine shop, a     
 Boots and a Smiths.                   </content>
