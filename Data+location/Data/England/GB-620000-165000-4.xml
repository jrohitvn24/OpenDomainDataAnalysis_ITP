		<content> The villages of Boyden Gate have      
 revived an ancient Kentish Custom,    
 that of {MUMMING.}There are two       
 'plays'.  The first is a drama the    
 cast of which includes St. George, The
 Black Knight, Princess Marion, a      
 Doctor and a Dragon.  St. George gets 
 killed by the dragon but the Doctor   
 revives him.  He is killed again by   
 the Black Knight and again revived.   
 It is a story of the cycle of life    
 and death. The second play is a sort  
 of historical pageant about the {ROMAN
 invasion, the Saxons and Robin Hood.  
 The tradition of the Hodden Horse was 
 common in these parts but died out at 
 the turn of the century.  The         
 villagers play cricket and rugby as a 
 village team activity.                
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
