		<title>04Life on the smaller farms</title>
		<content> Although there are larger farms in the
 area, there are a number of farms     
 which could be classed as "small"     
 (under 100 acres) and we did a survey 
 to see how life was and had, perhaps, 
 changed over the years. The majority  
 of the farms had been in existence in 
 some form for over 200 years and about
 half of the owners had inherited their
 farms while the remainder had bought  
 them. The majority saw the farm as    
 full time employment and because of   
 the size of the area owned, none      
 specialized in only one farming       
 type; but surprisingly only one farmer
 used the farm as a supplement to his  
 main income - a milk round. All farms 
 were worked by the family and life was
 deemed to be just as hard and         
 difficult as in the past. The E.E.C.  
 was not thought to be the answer for  
 the{small farmer.   }                 </content>
