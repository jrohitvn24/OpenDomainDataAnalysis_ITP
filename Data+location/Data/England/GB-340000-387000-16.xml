		<title>16DRUGS AND YOUTH.</title>
		<content>  Recently,{drug taking}in Netherley   
 has become a serious problem. It is   
 common because people are{unemployed} 
 and bored and take drugs for something
 to do. They often stay in bed all day 
 and then go and spend Â£2.50 upwards on
 drugs. It is easy to obtain a variety 
 of drugs from{dealers}on the estate.  
   Drug-takers get{addicted}and soon   
 need more and more, so they often     
{steal}from shops, houses and cars to  
 get money. Dealers on our estate will 
 give drugs in exchange for possessions
 such as rings or watches.If you can't 
 get money to pay them back you forfeit
 the item.                             
  There are{children}as young as{eight 
 on drugs and although schools warn us 
 of the dangers many ignore this and   
 experiment by inhaling petrol fumes or
 glue to get high. The{worst drug}is   
 heroin or 'smack',inhaled up the nose.</content>
