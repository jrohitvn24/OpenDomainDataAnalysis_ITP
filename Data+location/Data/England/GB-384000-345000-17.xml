		<title>17Newcastle Police Station</title>
		<content>Today we visited the Police Station in 
Newcastle.First we went to see the     
cells.There are four cells.So far this 
year (7th June) 700 people have passed 
through the cells.There is also a cell 
for juveniles.                         
Next we went to see the vehicles.There 
was a 1979 BMW motor bike.It has done  
76,000 miles.I sat on the bike.It is   
very big and has a loud siren.Then we  
saw a Range Rover that had a light on  
its roof that could be raised to a     
height of fifteen feet in an emergency 
so that drivers could see it earlier.  
The Range Rover also has a siren.      
We then went to the Crime Prevention   
Office where we were shown different   
locks.We saw a collection of offensive 
weapons taken off people at football   
matches.I had my fingerprints taken.   
Finally we saw a film about looking    
after our bikes.                       </content>
