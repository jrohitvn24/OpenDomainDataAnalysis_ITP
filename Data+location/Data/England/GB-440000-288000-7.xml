		<content> BURTON HASTINGS is a small peaceful   
 village on the outskirts of Nuneaton. 
 In the Domesday book Burton Hastings  
 was called Burtone. The word Hastings 
 was added in the 14th century after   
 the people who held the land. The main
 occupation of thee are has always been
 farming and it is today. A lot of the 
 land was owned by the Atkins family   
 who have Hosiery factories in         
 Hinckley, but most of the farms are   
 now owner occupied.There are about 60 
 houses in the village and 7 farms. The
 church, which dates from the 14th     
 century is built from sandstone from a
 nearby deserted village called Stetton
 Baskerville.A school which opened in  
 1873 closed in 1976 and the 90 pupils 
 were transferred to a school in       
 Wolvey. The secondary school children 
 travel to Bedworth. The old school    
 building is now a private residence.  </content>
