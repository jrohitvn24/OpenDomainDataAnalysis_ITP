		<title>18Conservation of wildlife.</title>
		<content> Conserving wildlife has become an     
 important theme in the teaching of the
 College of Agriculture. Students are  
 encouraged to consider wildlife when  
 farming. Within the College's farm    
 hedges are left whenever possible and 
 new 'shelter belts' planted to provide
 cover for the creatures to move       
 around without being detected.        
 A meadow, originally a wild garden has
 remained free of chemical fertilizers 
 and weed killers since 1900. One cut  
 of hay is taken in August and sheep   
 are allowed to graze in non growing   
 seasons to keep the grass down.       
 Daffodil Meadow, as it is called, is  
 covered, in season, by daffodils,     
 cowslips,buttercups,clovers and       
 vetches. Varieties of wild orchid are 
 also found including the Early Purple,
 the Butterfly and recently Bee        
 Orchids.                              </content>
