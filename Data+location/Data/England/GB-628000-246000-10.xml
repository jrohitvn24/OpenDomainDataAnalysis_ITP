		<content> With the{River Deben}on its           
 West flank, this area looks across    
 this tidal river to the small town of 
{Woodbridge.                           
 In its gently undulating landscape,   
 large fields of intensively           
 cultivated farmland lie sheltered by  
 woodland. At the northern boundary    
 two long straight roads divide the    
 area.                                 
 One leads eastwards to the{Woodbridge 
{Base.}Here American personnel are     
 involved in the defence of Europe. The
 other road runs southwards passing a  
 wooded picnic spot before entering the
 little village of{Sutton.             
 Close to the{Deben}is the important   
 archaeological site of{Sutton Hoo.    
 Along the marshy shoreline of the     
 Deben Estuary is much varied birdlife 
 Boats sail to and fro in a safe       
 haven, ten miles from the open sea.   </content>
