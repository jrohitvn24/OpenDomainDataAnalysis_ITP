		<content> Some other things Mr Trott told us:   
 Rabbits eat and destroy their crops.  
 They are controlled by organised      
 shoots and a rodent operator controls 
 rats.They have about 4 acres of rough 
 woodland. Most of the fields are      
 steeply sloping to the south. Mr.     
 Trott says that the steepness of the  
 land and the distance covered would   
 make the use of horses uneconomic.    
 Cattle have annual bloodtests for     
 T.B.,brucellosis and treatment against
 warble-fly. Manure is used for        
 fertiliser but must not be spread     
 in wet weather since run-off pollutes 
 streams.He thinks housing estates     
 should have playing-space as children 
 leave gates open and dogs worry       
 cattle. Rubbish and glass dumped are a
 danger to cattle and to tractor-tyres 
 which are expensive to replace. No    
 sheep or pigs are kept.               </content>
