		<title>19Customs in Hebden Bridge</title>
		<content> There are many customs which take     
 place in Hebden Bridge each year.     
 There are the{Hay Race,}where men     
 carry bales of hay up the Buttress (a 
 cobbled steep hill) to Heptonstall,   
 the{Pace Egg}play at Easter and the   
{Morris Dancers. Automobilia}is in     
 summer where old cars, vans, and      
 lorries are put on show. The most     
 ineresting custom that happens only in
 Hebden Bridge and nowhere else in the 
 world is the{Dock Pudding}competition.
 It is to see who can make the tastiest
 Dock Pudding. Dock Pudding is made out
 of Dock leaves. Dock is a wild flower 
 but you use the leaves. You wash them,
 grind them together and add porridge  
 oats and onions.                      
 The{Pace Egg}play takes place each    
 Easter. Lots of people dress up and   
 act the medieval style play of St.    
 George fighting the powers of evil.   </content>
