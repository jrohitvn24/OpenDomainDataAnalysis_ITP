		<content> The{Rush bearing Festival}is an       
 ancient annual custom  of Tilston that
  takes place during the{Wakes.}(See   
{EVENTS IN TILSTON.) }It is a relic of 
 the time when fresh rushes were placed
 on the earthen floor of houses.In late
 August, rushes are gathered from the  
 local ponds and are used to decorate  
 the{graves and church}which are also  
 decorated with flowers. There is a    
 Rushbearing{Service}on the last Sunday
 in August. No one knows the origin of 
 this custom but there are similar     
 customs in nearby villages e.g.       
 Shocklach. The local Methodist Chapel 
 has an annual{Songs of Praise}Sunday. 
 Many local people take part by singing
 or by playing musical instruments.    
 There is a Rememberance Sunday Parade 
 led by the Ex-service men with the    
 guides &amp; brownies.{Harvest Sunday}is  
 an annual event.                      </content>
