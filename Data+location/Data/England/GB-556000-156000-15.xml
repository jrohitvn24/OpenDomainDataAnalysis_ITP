		<title>15RECREATION IN IGHTHAM</title>
		<content>       At the present time, as far as  
 we know, the sports in Ightham are:   
 Football, Badminton, Tennis, Cricket, 
 Netball and Five-a-side Football.     
       So far we have asked Mrs.       
 Saunders about the Hard Courts. We    
 found out that there are nearly 300   
 members including Junior, Senior and  
 Social members. Everyone can have a   
 key if they pay a deposit of Â£2.00. If
 you want to give the key back, you get
 your money back. The Hard Courts cost 
 Â£16 000 to build. The Sports Council  
 financed about 40%, the rest was made 
 by fund raising. The Hard Courts were 
 opened in August 1983. Duncan Goodhew,
 the olympic swimmer, gave a cheque    
 towards it.                           
       We also went to see Mr.Vanbergen
 about the Cricket Club. We found out  
 that Mr.L.Chapman is the Chairman of  
 the Club.The President is Mr.H.Durling</content>
