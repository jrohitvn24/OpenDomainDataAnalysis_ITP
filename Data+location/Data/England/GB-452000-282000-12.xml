		<content>      The number of houses being sold  
 in Lutterworth is an indication of    
 changes of population.  According to a
 survey of local Estate Agents 450     
 houses a year are sold in Lutterworth.
 Detached houses and those in the price
 range Â£20,000 to Â£30,000 are the most 
 sought after.                         
                                       
      The houses in the price range    
 Â£20,000 to Â£30,000 are generally small
 and in the centre of the town.  Those 
 in the price range Â£30,000 to Â£40,000 
 are semi-detached and on new estates. 
                                       
      The present population of        
 Lutterworth is nearly 7,000.  New     
 housing estates are being built to    
 accommodate the continuing growing    
 population.
