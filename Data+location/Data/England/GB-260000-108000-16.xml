		<content>{DAIRY} Around Winkleigh and other     
 areas near Winkleigh the popular cows 
 are Friesian. The E.E.C. have brought 
 out milk quotas. Here is a comment    
 from a farmer. " Quotas are necessary 
 because of over production in milk,   
 but are unfairly distributed because  
 those who produce a lot of milk and   
 flood the market only get cut by the  
 same  percentage as those who produce 
 little." BEEF There is a lot of beef, 
 with the second biggest abbatoir in   
 Europe at Torrington.We have quite a  
 few sheep mostly Suffolk and Suffolk  
 cross.Poultry is reared for eggs and  
 meat,wheat, barley and corn are grown.
