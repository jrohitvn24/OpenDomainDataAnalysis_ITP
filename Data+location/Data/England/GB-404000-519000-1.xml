		<content> This block, immediatly to the north of
 Barnard Castle, lacks any distinctive 
 features common t its neighbouring    
 blocks in Teesdale.   The terrrain    
 undulates gemtly.   Predominantly     
 grazing, there are small areas sown to
 kale, barley and potatoes, the former 
 for animal feed.   Approximately one  
 third of the pasture is cropped as hat
 for winter feed.   Winters can be     
 very cold (-15c is common) due        
 primarily to the high winds which are 
 present intermitently throughour the  
 year.   Snow falls can average a dpeth
 of 3ft, but zero or 6ft in a season   
 are not uncommon.   Summers can be    
 extremely pleasant, rarely becoming   
 dry, yet with some sustained periods  
 of fine weather allowing fine views   
 across the dales.   Principal         
 occupations are farming, or working in
 Barnard Castle (often both).          </content>
