		<content>  Found in the Sheffield Diocese it is 
 about 800 years old. The present      
 rector the thirty_eighth is Mr.       
 Matthews.A non working clock on the   
 west wall, made in 1710,has the name  
 Gertrude Copley written on it.Pictures
 on the pew ends show two people facing
 each other to represent marriage,     
 another shows two people back to back 
 to show divorce.The last one shows a  
 man with three faces it is thought to 
 show deceitfulness.There's a pulpit   
 with a sounding board over it to      
 project the Rectors voice.A South Wall
 chapel was built by the Copley family.
 Near the the west wall is a pew end   
 which hasn't been finished and is     
 thought to mean that no matter how we 
 try we can never do a job properly for
 God.The Rector performs 15 Weddings,22
 Funerals and 30 Christenings annually.
 The Congregation numbers about 100.   </content>
