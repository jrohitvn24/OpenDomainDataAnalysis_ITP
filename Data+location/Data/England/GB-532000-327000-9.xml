		<title>09Dykes Around Holbeach Bank</title>
		<content> After the sea wall was built the land 
 was still wet so they dug dykes to    
 drain the land. Today there are many  
 dykes around Holbeach Bank.Some dykes 
 were man made and some are old rivers 
 that have been straightened out. If   
 you do not keep dykes clean they silt 
 up so farmers get grass cutters for   
 the grass at the side of the bank. We 
 saw a dyke that had silted up. Weeds  
 were growing there and blocking the   
 water. If all the dykes got like this 
 the land would get  marshy  again     
 so the dykes are very useful. There   
 is a lot of wildlife  along the dykes 
 They are a main part of our           
 countryside. Some of the farmers have 
 filled in the dykes and piped the     
 water to gain extra land.
