		<content>   Much of the charm of the village    
 lies in the pleasing variety of styles
 of architecture. The oldest cottages  
 are timber-framed, some of them       
 incorporating a four hundred year old 
 structure behind a more recent facade.
 The exterior aspects include          
 attractive specimens of pargetting or 
 ornamental plasterwork and plain Essex
 boarding. Some of the old cottages are
 still thatched, although in many cases
 the roofs are now slate or tile.      
   Nineteenth century buildings include
 'Great Chalks' (the former vicarage)  
 and 'Brick House', both in the        
 High Street. Barrington Hall, the     
 former manor house, was begun in 1735 
 but was not completed until 1863.     
   The more recent houses include      
 bungalows, 'council houses' (built by 
 the local authority) and several areas
 developed by local builders.          </content>
