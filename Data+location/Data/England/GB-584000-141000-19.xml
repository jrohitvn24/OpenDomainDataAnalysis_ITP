		<title>19Smarden W. - Children's Fun</title>
		<content> Children's hobbies and pastimes       
 include the old and the new. Board and
 card games are increasing in variety  
 and now computer games are taking over
 in some homes. Boys are keen to own a 
 BMX bicycle, a cycle with an extra    
 strong frame for rough riding, jumps  
 and twists. Girls are apt to          
 predominate in the pony world though  
 boys also enjoy riding and jumping.   
 Pets abound; dogs and cats may top the
 list but rabbits, guinea pigs,        
 hamsters, gerbils and goldfish are    
 popular. Most children will collect a 
 variety of objects: stamps, coins,    
 shells etc., and construction toys    
 give many happy hours in bad weather. 
 Model railways or car racing tracks   
 are popular, especially with fathers. 
 Reading, painting and drawing still   
 appeal to many and dolls still please.
 Ball games are as popular as ever.    </content>
