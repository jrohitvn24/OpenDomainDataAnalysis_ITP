		<title>03Bethlem Royal Hospital</title>
		<content>   Bethlem Royal Hospital is situated  
at the crossroads of Monks Orchard Rd, 
Wickham Rd and Bridle Rd. It was foun- 
ded over 730 years ago.                
   The function of the hospital is to  
help and look after people who are men-
tally ill. The Bethlem Royal Hospital's
job has changed over the years, as have
the buildings it has been housed in. In
1674 it was decided that the hospital  
house was old, weak and ruinous, too   
cramped and never held more than sixty 
people. It must be rebuilt somewhere   
else.                                  
   It was built on the Monks Orchard   
Estate in this century. There were four
wards: Tyson, Fitzmary, Gresham and    
Whitley, each one having its own gar-  
den.                                   
   At the moment, Bethlem is run by the
National Health Service.
