		<title>10A school day in Guildford</title>
		<content>    I arrive at school at 8.45 a.m. and
 play in the playground with my friends
 until the whistle goes at 9.00. After 
 registration we usually have English, 
 but today we had a rehearsal for our  
 special end of term{assembly}play. At 
 10.40 we had a fifteen minute break in
 the playground. After play it was     
 mathematics until lunch at 12.00. I   
 had a{school dinner}with 75 other     
 children in the school hall. (127     
 children bring sandwiches, which are  
 also eaten in the hall and 6 children 
 go home for lunch). School lunch was  
 cold turkey and chips, followed by    
 butterscotch tart. Afterwards I       
 played football with my friends on the
 field until 1.30 p.m. During the      
 afternoon we did follow-up work for   
 our{residential visit}to York which   
 had taken place earlier in the term.  
 School ended at 3.15 p.m.             </content>
