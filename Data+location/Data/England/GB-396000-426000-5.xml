		<title>05The Bridge of Hebden</title>
		<content> The oldest man-made structure in      
 the area is probably the{bridge}in    
 Hebden Bridge. In medieval times the  
 bridge was built out of wood, but in  
 1510 it was altered and replaced by   
 stone. In view from above there are   
 three triangle shapes which people    
 used to go in when pack horses were   
 passing by. The bridge was made       
 because there was a shallow river     
 running all along the middle of Hebden
 Bridge and lots of people had         
 difficulty crossing it. Then in 1602  
 and 1657 the bridge was repaired and  
 its parapets were made higher and     
 longer. The parapet was repaired      
 in 1845. The Eastern arch crossed the 
 tail race which ran all the way from  
 Bridge Mill, which was a Manorial corn
 mill for the parish of Wadsworth.
