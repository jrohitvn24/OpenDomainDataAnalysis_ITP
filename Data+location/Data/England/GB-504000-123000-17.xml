		<content> These are some of the pets kept by    
 children in Wisborough Green in 1985. 
 Julia - I have two rabbits, one cat   
 and one fish. I used to have four fish
 but three died and Sooty, our last    
 cat, died too.                        
 Thomas - I have two hamsters and two  
 fishes. The finches hop and jump about
 their cage.                           
 James - My daddy made a cage for my   
 rabbit and run so that he could run   
 about. When he was on the grasss he   
 was trying to dig a tunnel to get away
 but my daddy put it on the patio. I   
 have a dog called Lassie and Denny is 
 my cat. My rabbit is called Smokey.   
 Luke - I have a dog called Lady Jane  
 of Avon. She is a Labrador and she is 
 a good guard dog.                     
 Nick - I have 62 woodlice. They have  
 twelve legs I think. I also have two  
 gerbils. They are desert rats.        </content>
