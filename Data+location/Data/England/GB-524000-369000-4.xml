		<title>04THE FARMER AND CONSERVATION</title>
		<content> Mr Chatterton farms near Low Toynton  
 and uses insecticides to protect his  
 crops. He tries to use sprays that    
 only kill aphids. Weed killers destroy
 the homes of many creatures so he     
 tries to spray 4 feet away from all   
 hedges to help conserve wildlife      
 there.                                
   He plants about 8 trees every year  
 and conserves copses, about \ an acre 
 altogether on his land. Rivers and    
 streams flow through his land, the    
 biggest being the River Waring, which 
 hold many creatures like trout, water 
 vole and stickleback. Rare visitors   
 are the heron, moorhen and kingfisher.
   He burns stubble which he says is   
 essential for a clean field. It also  
 gives back nutrients to the soil. The 
 disadvantage of burning is that it    
 destroys the homes of many creatures.
