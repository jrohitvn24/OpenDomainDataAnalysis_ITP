		<title>02THE WENT HILLS AREA-OVERVIEW</title>
		<content>    This is an agricultural area. Most 
 of the{farming}is arable. The River   
 Went, which gives its name to part of 
 the area, flows through a pretty      
 valley in the Went Hills. There is a{ 
{Nature Reserve} on its banks. The area
 is well-wooded, with mixed            
 plantations.                          
    There is little{employment}within  
 the area,apart from farming and       
 those industries which serve the      
 farms,the only other jobs are in the  
{hotels and restaurants.               
     The{transport}and communication   
 network is very important to the area.
 The A1/M62 Junction is very close, so 
 there is easy access to all parts of  
 Britain. The area is a good stopping  
 place for travellers, as well as being
 a place where people can live in the  
 country and commute to the cities     
 and town in the Region.               </content>
