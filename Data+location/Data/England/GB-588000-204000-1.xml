		<content>          GENERAL SURVEY               
 On the 1st July 1985 we did our part  
 of the Domesday Survey.  The area we  
 covered was farmland in Mundon which  
 is situated about 4 miles south of    
 Maldon,the nearest town.We also       
 surveyed part of the Blackwater       
 Estuary and Osea island.              
   Much of the farmland we covered is  
 very low-lying and flooding used to be
 a great problem. The last major flood 
 was in 1956.   After this the Water   
 Authority built up the seawall which  
 is about 7 miles long.  Flooding is no
 longer a problem.  Much of what is now
  farmland had to be reclaimed from the
 sea and there is still quite a lot of 
 marshland   in this area.             
   The Blackwater Estuary covers much  
 of our area and the population is very
 small - about 30 people in total.
