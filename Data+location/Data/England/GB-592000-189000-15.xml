		<title>15FISHING</title>
		<content> There are six fishing boats working   
 out of  Barling  Creek. They are      
 called Nicholas, Win, De Hoop,        
 Buzzard, Sylvia and Gandalf. One      
 of the boats has a 150 horse power    
 engine and is 13 metres long. The     
 other boats are about the same length.
 In the summer they often fish for sole
 around the sands of the Thames        
 Estuary. They also stretch a net      
 between two boats to catch sprats.    
 The sprats are sold to factory ships  
 from Russia or Norway. The boats      
 fish for scallops near Rye or         
 whitebait in the Wash. In winter they 
 pull rakes to collect whiteweed or    
 trawl for cod. The boats are usually  
 out for 18 hours at a time. The best  
 fishing is when the tides are         
 moderate, as the fish can see the net 
 if mud is not stirred up by the moving
 water.                                </content>
