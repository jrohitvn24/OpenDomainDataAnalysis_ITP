		<title>05WHERE PEOPLE WORK</title>
		<content>   We decided to use the 230 children  
 in our school to try and find out     
 where most people in Donington work by
 asking them about their parents.      
   We found that about three times more
 fathers travel away from Donington to 
 work than actually work in Donington. 
 Only twenty three fathers were        
 involved in farming.                  
   However when we asked about mothers 
 working, twice as many mothers worked 
 in Donington as travelled out of the  
 area and about half of these mothers  
 were involved in farming.             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
