		<title>07Swainston Manor in the Past.</title>
		<content> Swainston Manor is the{largest and    
{oldest building}in our area.The name  
 of the house is said to derive from a 
 Viking called{Sweyne}who is thought to
 have settled on the same site as the  
 present house. The house was for many 
 years the property of the Bishops of  
 Winchester, until it was seized by    
 King Edward 1.Later it became the     
 property of the Barrington family, in 
 whose ownership it remained for 300   
 years.The last member of the family   
 lived here until 1941, when the house 
 was bombed during a wartime air raid. 
 Full repairs were begun in 1950 and   
 they took four years to complete at a 
 cost of Â£50,000.The Manor then became 
 a{private school,}until in 1981 it    
 became a{hotel}for the first time.The 
 oldest part of the Manor is the 12th. 
 century chapel which is at present    
 used for dances and banquets.         </content>
