		<content> Melton Mowbray has been a famous      
 hunting centre since the early 19th   
 century and has been visited by       
 nobility &amp; gentry during the hunting  
 season. There are many of the old     
 hunting lodges still left in the town 
 although they have been put to new    
 uses.                                 
                                       
 Traditionally Hunt Cake is eaten at a 
 hunt. The cake is still made at the   
 bakers Dickinson &amp; Morris' in         
 Nottingham Street,Melton Mowbray.     
                                       
 Melton is also famous for its pork    
 pies &amp; Stilton cheese. Both are still 
 made in and around the town today.    
                                       
 Each December there is a Fatstock Show
 in the town where prizes are awarded  
 for the best cheeses and pies.
