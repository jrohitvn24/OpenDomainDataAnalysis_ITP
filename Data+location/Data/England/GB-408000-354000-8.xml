		<content>     Old Hannah's Cave looks at you    
from above, the river flows down       
towards the ford where the Hoo Brook   
joins the Manifold.  When you go along 
the track to the Wetton-Butterton road 
you go straight on across the road and 
keep going down the winding valley.  To
your right is Ladyside Wood and to your
left is Thor's Cave.                   
{The Wetton Caves}   Old Hannah's cave 
is at Wetton Mill.  Bones, pottery and 
bone tools were recently found there.  
The next cave southwards is called     
Ossom's Cave built into Ossom's Hill.  
Thor's Cave was examined by Carrington,
a Wetton schoolmaster, who found some  
relics which were sent to the British  
Museum.  Beeston Tor Cave goes back    
into a massive rock face.  In the      
1920s Rev.G.H.Wilson found Saxon coins 
and jewelry there.  Some of the finds  
are in Hanley Museum.                  </content>
