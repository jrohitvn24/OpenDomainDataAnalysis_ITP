		<content>   A new school was built in l965 on   
 land where the W.I. had had their hut.
 Houses have been built in Hornbeam    
 Close, Stone Pit and Whitlands, also  
 some bungalows for the elderly in Gold
 Street.  Two garden centres have been 
 opened and extended, a new cricket    
 pavilion built, a drag racing strip   
 opened at Santa Pod and a 30 m.p.h    
 speed limit introduced.               
   Many people mentioned the loss of   
 roadmen, a regular bus service and an 
 increase in heavy traffic through     
 Podington. The co-operative shop      
 closed, but a new United Services Club
 was opened. Footpaths and street      
 lighting have been improved and       
 extended. In the church stonework and 
 the organ have been restored. The     
 parishes of Podington, Hinwick,       
 Farndish and Wymington have been com- 
 bined to form one living.             </content>
