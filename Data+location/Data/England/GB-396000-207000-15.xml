		<title>15LIFE FOR A TEENAGER D.ABBOTS</title>
		<content> One young person from the village was 
 interviewed.She had not been born in  
 the area but moved in at the age of 8.
 She travels to Kingshill school by    
 bus.There isn't a great deal to do in 
 the evenings so she meets friends in  
 Cirencester,relying on parents for the
 12-mile round trip.At weekends she    
 goes to South Cerney watersports area 
 where she enjoys windsurfing.Most of  
 her friends live outside the village  
 and often she stays overnight with    
 them.The village is too quiet for her 
 and once old enough she will leave to 
 live in a town in the Midlands .The   
 only hobby she enjoys at home is      
 listening to pop music.               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
