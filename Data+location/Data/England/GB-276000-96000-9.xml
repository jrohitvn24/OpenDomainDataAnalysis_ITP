		<title>09VILLAGE SHOP,Yeoford.</title>
		<content> There is only one shop in the whole of
 our area. It is in the village of     
 Yeoford. The building is over one     
 hundred years old and used to be      
 stables for the horses which were used
 in the stage coach from{Exeter}to{    
{London.}The building became a shop    
 fifty years ago. It is now a Post     
 Office and a General Stores. You can  
 buy all kinds of things there. The    
 children buy their sweets there and   
 the most popular kind is chewits. The 
 adults buy bread and fresh vegetables 
 there and enjoy a chat! The tinned    
 food is a little more expensive but if
 you add on the price of petrol to{    
{Crediton}there is no difference. There
 is only one bus a week to{Crediton}so 
 it is very handy to have a local shop.
 The shop and Post Office are closed on
 a Tuesday afternoon and the Post      
 Office is also closed on Saturday p.m.</content>
