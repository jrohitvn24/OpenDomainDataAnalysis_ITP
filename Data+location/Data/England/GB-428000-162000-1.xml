		<title>01THE RURAL AREA OF SHALBOURNE</title>
		<content> Shalbourne is the only complete       
 village in the area. A{linear village,
 it is in a loop road{off}the SE side  
 of the{Oxford-Salisbury road,}just    
 inside Wiltshire. The land around is  
 mostly agricultural, six farms        
 sharing the acreage, growing cereals, 
 rape, beans, etc. There are some large
 blocks of mainly deciduous woodland.  
 Bedwyn railway and the canal are just 
 in the NW corner of the block. The    
{character}of Shalbourne has{changed   
 considerably in the last half century 
{from}being entirely{agricultural}with 
 ancillary trades to being mostly a    
{dormitory area}for people working in  
 nearby towns and a quiet place for    
 retired professional people. Some     
 houses are used for weekends/holidays 
 only, doing little to help the running
 of the village or supporting the post 
 office cum grocer's shop.             </content>
