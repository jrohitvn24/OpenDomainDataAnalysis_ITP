		<title>11Longleat House</title>
		<content> Longleat House was built in 1580 and  
 is 405 years old. It was built by Sir 
 John Thynne who was knighted by the   
 Protector, the Duke of Somerset on the
 battle field of Pinkie whilst his     
 wounds were still bleeding; he died in
 1580 just before the house was        
 completed.                            
 Today Longleat is not used by all the 
 Thynn family but Viscount Weymouth and
 his family occupy a small part of it. 
 Many tourists visit the house each    
 year and marvel at its magnificent    
 interior and beautifully restored     
 kitchens which are no longer used for 
 cooking the enormous meals of days    
 gone by.
