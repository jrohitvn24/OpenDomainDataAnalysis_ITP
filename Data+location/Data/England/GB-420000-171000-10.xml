		<title>10LAND USE DOWNLAND MINAL</title>
		<content> From the analyses on p. 4-9 it will be
 seen that the land is predominantly   
 under intensive cultivation, Only in  
 squares 220730 and 220710 are there   
 significant areas of woodland farms 1 
 &amp; 4. This covers less than 25% of the 
 squares. The majority of the woods and
 hedges are of mixed trees and         
 semi-wild. There is some interest in  
 conservation, and shelter belts are   
 planted where necessary. At Warren    
 Farm no. 5, new hedges and trees are  
 being planted. The woodland is used as
 pheasant preserve. There is a small   
 area of natural grassland on the scarp
 surrounding the chalkpit, 206738. Some
 of the pasture on the scarp has not   
 been ploughed in recent years, if     
 ever, but may have been fertilised,   
 thus changing the ecological balance.
