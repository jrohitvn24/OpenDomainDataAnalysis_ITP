		<title>10Shipham's Sunday School.</title>
		<content>  The S.S. started in February 1984.   
 Mrs. Mitchell and some ladies got     
 together and organised  it with the   
 Vicar's help.They organise every      
 Sunday morning except when we have a  
 Family Service. There are 6 teachers  
 and a lady who helps.  We have about  
 26 regular members and some older     
 children who come on special          
 occasions.                            
  Each week we go down to Church at    
 half past nine.  We sing some         
 children's hymns and have a prayer.   
 Next we go into our age grups and we  
 learn about Jesus. We use leaflets    
 called Adventures and we all like     
 them. When we hear the little ones    
 singing their choruses we gather back 
 together again and one of the children
 says a prayer. We sing some more hymns
 and then it is time to go home.
