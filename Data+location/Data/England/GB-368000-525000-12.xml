		<title>12BED &amp; BREAKFAST IN DUFTON</title>
		<content>  A family of four,originally from     
 Lancashire,moved into Bow Hall in     
 January 1984.They love life there,    
 especially meeting all the interesting
 people who call in their tea-room or  
 stay and have bed &amp; breaskfast _mostly
 country-loving people who enjoy the   
 peace of the fells.High Cup Nick is an
 obvious attraction to the area.On     
 average,10,000 people walk the Pennine
 Way each year.This passes Bow Hall on 
 its way from Edale in Derbyshire to   
 Kirk Yetholm _a distance of 257 miles.
 Unfortunately, due to the bad summer  
 of 1985 only 3000 hikers have ventured
 the Way,thus reducing the income at   
 Bow Hall very considerably,and making 
 it necessary for father to go out &amp;   
 earn money by selling seed to farmers.
 The 2 daughters (aged 16 &amp; 12) go to  
 Appleby Grammar School -whilst mother 
 keeps the home fires burning.         </content>
