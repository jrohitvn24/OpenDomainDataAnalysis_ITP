		<content>    There are three main congregations 
 of Christian Worshippers in           
 Hellifield,the Church of England at   
 St.Aidans Church, the Methodists and  
 the Roman Catholics who worship in    
 Settle.  In addition there are other  
 small groups of Christians who prefer 
 to worship God in their way.          
    The people of all ages who attend  
 worship in their churches in          
 Hellifield give thanks to God each    
 week for His goodness shown to them in
 the wonders of the world and in their 
 own lives.  They pray also for the    
 special needs of the young, the old,  
 the sick and the suffering.           
    The Christian religion teaches us  
 to love God.  Christians also love    
 their neighbours as though they are   
 ourselves.  So Christians are members 
 of nearly all the village societies,  
 clubs and organisations.              </content>
