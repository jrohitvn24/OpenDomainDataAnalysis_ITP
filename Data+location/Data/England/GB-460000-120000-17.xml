 A very inadequate bus service serves  
 the villages. It is possible to travel
 north, to West Meon and thence to     
 Petersfield, Winchester  or           
 Southampton and south to Fareham and  
 Portsmouth. However, the buses are    
 very infrequent, take slow and        
 circuitous routes and allow little    
 time for shopping etc. before catching
 catching the only bus home.           
 The majority of families have a car   
 but those who do not (mostly elderly) 
 are very cut off. Consequently a      
 voluntary mini bus service to Fareham 
 Shopping Centre has been organised and
 runs twice a week.                    
 The railway which used to come through
 Meonstoke, from Alton to Fareham, was 
 closed in 1955.
