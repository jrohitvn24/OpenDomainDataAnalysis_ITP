		<title>02Chesterfield Canal:Gringley</title>
		<content> The Chesterfield Canal near Gringley  
 was first planned in 1769.The Act     
 of Parliament was passed in 1771 and  
 the first part was opened in 1774,and 
 the rest in 1777.It was a convenient  
 way of transporting goods from areas  
 around Chesterfield.Today it is used  
 for leisure eg.swimming (at Middle    
 Bridge) &amp; fishing;canoeing lessons    
 near Smith's Bridge (Grid ref.754 929)
 and by the derelict Brick works(Grid  
 ref.754 928).The only working barges  
 are those owned by Anglia Water       
 Authority which keep the canal or     
 "cruiser way" clear for those barges  
 giving pleasure-rides.No commercial   
 cargoes are carried by narrow boats   
 nowadays.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
