		<title>01The Area</title>
		<content> This area is located in Dorset on the 
 north-west boundary of the Borough    
 of Poole. Part of the area lies within
 Poole but most lies within the county 
 district.                             
 The area can be divided into three    
 basic sectors.                        
 The eastern sector comprising of      
 residential development. Most of this 
 has taken place since 1950.           
 The western area is basically pastural
 farming.                              
 The central sector can be sub-divided 
 into a residential area and an area of
 natural sand-heath. This heathland    
 although of scientific interest is    
 under great pressure from developers  
 to extend the light industry and      
 residential area.
