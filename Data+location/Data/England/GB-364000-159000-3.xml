		<content>{1)Livestock Farming.                  
     We went to Tunley Farm and had a  
 look around.It is really a mixed      
 farm.Mr. Jones has 2 dogs,2           
 donkeys,120 calves,10 pigs,2 horses   
 and 135 cows.Mr.Jones gets up at      
 5.30 a.m.to milk the cows.He milks    
 twice daily.It is a mixed farm of 500 
 acres,some of which are in our area.{ 
{2)Arable Farming.                     
     At Castle Farm,Mr.Perry grows     
 barley,potatoes and kale.The barley   
 was planted in March,the kale in June,
 as were the potatoes.He planted his   
 seeds with a tractor with a drill     
 attachment.He has been driving a      
 tractor since he was thirteen. At busy
  times he employs three extra men to  
 help  him with the work. The animals  
 he has on his farm affect the crops he
 grows.Castle Farm is a mixed farm.{By
