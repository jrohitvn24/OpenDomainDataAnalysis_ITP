		<content>J and E Halls now renamed A.P.V. Hall  
are this year celebrating their two    
hundreth year, it has been on the same 
site for all these years.  The site is 
where a Tudor Palace was built for Anne
of Cleves to spend her last eight years
of life, Henry the eighth built it     
after demolishing the Priory which was 
on that site.  In the factory is an old
building known as the Priory which in  
fact is not a Priory but is a Gate     
House of the Tudor Palace.             
Halls have won the Queens award for one
of there products called the           
"Hallscrew" which is a part on a       
fridge. The air nozzles for Concorde   
aircraft were produced at Hall as      
were the air conditioning for          
Buckingham Palace, The Houses of       
Parliament and Harrods.
