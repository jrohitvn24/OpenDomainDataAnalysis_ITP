		<content> The prison serves as one of the 8     
 nationwide 'dispersal prisons' for    
 long term (over 4 years and up to     
 life) sentenced prisoners. The average
 number of inmates is just in excess of
 700 on a daily basis, approximately   
 50% of them serving life sentences.   
 The prisoners are housed in 4 main    
 'wings' or blocks, each having cell   
 space for up to 180 inmates. The daily
 routine includes breakfast, work in   
 engineering, textile, or miscellaneous
 workshops, lunch, further work on all 
 weekdays (Monday to Friday inclusive),
 a tea meal, and then a period of      
 leisure activities ('association') on 
 each evening of the week and at       
 weekends. Sports and games feature    
 prominently in the leisure curriculum 
 including football, volleyball,       
 running,and gymnasium work including  
 weight lifting.       >>>>>next page. </content>
