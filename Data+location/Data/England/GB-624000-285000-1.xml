 This area covers most of the parish of
 Alburgh and a little of the parish of 
 Redenhall near Harleston in Norfolk.  
 The community is tied very closely to 
 the land with agriculture being the   
 main industry. Many fakilies have     
 lived in the area for four or five    
 generations and know the fields,      
 buildings, flora and fauna as well as 
 their own families.                   
 There are a number of scattered       
 dwellings, originally farm houses and 
 cottages among the fields with the    
 village of Alburgh providing the only 
 close community.                      
 Household shopping is done generally  
 in Harleston or Bungay 4 miles away   
 with Norwich serving the community as 
 the major town.                       </content>
