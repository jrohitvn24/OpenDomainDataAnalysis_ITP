		<content>      There are successful football and
 cricket clubs who play at their Cuttle
 Lane ground. A Sports Club has        
 recently been formed with plans to    
 improve this ground and to provide a  
 tennis court.                         
      At Slaughterford and Giddea Hall 
 where the land is very steep and the  
 pasture is poor, farmers have turned  
 their waste acres over to moto-cross. 
 This is motor cycling racing over a   
 very rough circuit. It has an         
 enthusiastic following for both riders
 and spectators (except for those who  
 live in the vicinity of the courses   
 and their loudspeaker systems.        
      There are swimming pools at      
 Corsham, Chippenham (open air) and    
 Bath and sports centres in Chippenham,
 Melksham and Bath. Tennis courts are  
 available at Corsham School and       
 skittle alleys and darts in many pubs.</content>
