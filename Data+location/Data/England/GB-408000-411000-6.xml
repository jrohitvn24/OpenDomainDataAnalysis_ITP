		<content>{The Travellers' Rest}at{Meltham}was   
 originally a farmhouse and it changed 
 to a public house many years ago when 
 two farmer brothers who lived there   
 decided to brew their own beer.       
                                       
 An old-time publican kept a stewpan on
 the fire in the tap room and topped it
 up with anything and everything       
 ,including dead hens killed on the    
 road and offal from the butcher.It was
 said to smell delicious!!             
                                       
 Dotted around the wall are old price  
 lists ;half of bitter 11d and a nip of
 old Arctic Barley Wine was 1s 11d.A   
 turnip and a large hammer are to be   
 found on the bar and customers are    
 invited to 'bray' coins into the      
 turnip which is then auctioned for    
 charity.
