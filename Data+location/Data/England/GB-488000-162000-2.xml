 The archaeological dig, is in{Bagshot,
 and it was opened in 1983, next to the
 'Three Mariners' public house, which  
 was built in 1750.                    
                                       
                                       
 It started off as an excavation,      
 when archaeoloists thought that there 
 were foundations of an inn there.     
 The inn is probably the{Red Lion,}    
 formerley known as the{Saracen's Head}
 which dates from the{16th Century}    
                                       
                                       
                                       
 Among the artefacts recovered from the
 site are fragments of{leather         
{shoes,cow's skulls and ribs}as well as
 a{silver coin}found by Mrs Lucas,a    
 teacher at{Connaught School.}
