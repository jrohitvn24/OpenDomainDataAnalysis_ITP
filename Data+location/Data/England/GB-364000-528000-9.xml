		<title>09Helm Wind</title>
		<content> This wind only began to blow a few    
 hundred years ago. The position of the
 Eden Valley with the unbroken line of 
 the Pennine Range has formed a number 
 of small and large  vacuums. The      
 warmer air in the Valley is at a lower
 pressure and this sucks the air from  
 the fell top which is at a higher     
 pressure. As the air comes  down  it  
 begins to whirl and roar and thus we  
 have the Helm wind.The force of the   
 helm wind has decreased in the last   
 10 years. This is possibly because as 
 mechanistion of the valley increases, 
 more exhaust gases are expelled into  
 the atmosphere and more coal and oil  
 is burned therefore more heat is      
 spreading to the hills; this is now   
 filling the vacuum that the forces of 
 nature used to fill up. Long ago      
 people believed the Fell was inhabited
 by fiends when the Helm wind blew.    </content>
