		<title>20A CHILD'S DAY</title>
		<content> In the morning I get up, have my      
 breakfast and put on my school        
 uniform. When I get to school I play  
 cricket till 09.00. We have a daily   
 assembly and then we have R.E. and    
 English until playtime at 10.30. We   
 usually do Maths. until dinner time at
 12.10. After dinner I play outside. In
 the afternoon we work on topics and   
 enjoy music and art, with a playtime  
 at 14.15. The afternoon usually       
 finishes with a class story. I go home
 at 15.25 on the bus to Middleton. When
 I get home I tell my mum what I have  
 done at school and she tells me what  
 she has done. I sit down and watch    
 television and when my brother comes  
 home from his school in Bakewell we   
 have tea. I go out to play until      
 18.00. I watch television before I go 
 to bed.
