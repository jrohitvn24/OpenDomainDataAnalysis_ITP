		<title>19Footpaths in Collingham</title>
		<content> In 1983-84 the network of foot and    
 bridle paths was somewhat revised as  
 part of a county policy to ensure that
 they are useable.                     
 This was not so in Collingham         
 previously in many cases where{       
{diagonal and headland paths }had been 
 ploughed out,cropped and obstructed.  
 The pattern now replaces some diagonal
 with headland paths,new routes have   
 been negotiated,some abandoned such   
 that the network meets leisure needs  
 rather than exactly displaying its    
 historical origins.Paths through the  
 village have been maintained and old  
 routeways diverted through new estates
 being well used.The revised wide      
 network has been well signposted,     
 stiles and footbridges erected.To     
 protect the rights of the walking     
 villagers it is intended to pursue a  
 policy which stops future obstruction.</content>
