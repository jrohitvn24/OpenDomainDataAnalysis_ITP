		<content>   Sir John Barrow was born in 1764 in 
 the hamlet of Dragley Beck. Behind the
 cottage where he was born runs a      
 stream which gave the hamlet its name.
 After attending the local school,his  
 interest in navigation and astronomy  
 took him on a whaling expedition to   
 the Antarctic,followed by travels to  
 China and S.Africa. When he returned  
 to England he became{Secretary to the 
{Admiralty}and wrote "Mutiny on the    
 Bounty". He helped establish the{Royal
{Geographical Society.}He died in 1845 
 at the age of 85. A primary school in 
 Ulverston is named after him.         
  {Hoad Monument,}a 100 ft. high lime- 
 stone tower in the form of a light-   
 house was built in his honour in 1850,
 on Hoad Hill above the town. Today    
 Hoad Monument is an Ulverston land-   
 mark which can be seen for miles      
 around.                               </content>
