		<title>13A Day in the Life of a Child</title>
		<content>I WAS WOKEN UP AT 08.00 BY MY SISTER   
BECAUSE I WAS TIRED. BREAKFAST WAS     
SCRAMBLED EGGS ON TOAST AND MILK. BY   
08.20 I HAD BRUSHED MY HAIR AND WASHED 
MY FACE AND TEETH. AFTER COLLECTING MY 
COAT AND SCHOOL BAG I LEFT FOR SCHOOL  
IN THE CAR WITH MY YOUNGER SISTER. AS I
AM A MONITOR I TOOK THE REGISTERS ROUND
TO ALL THE CLASSES AT 08.45.WHEN SCHOOL
STARTED AT 09.00 IT WAS INFANT ASSEMBLY
SO I STARTED MATHS STRAIGHT AWAY.DURING
BREAK I DRANK MY MILK AND DID SOME     
SEWING.I DID SOME WRITTEN WORK AFTER   
PLAY UNTIL LUNCH.I HAVE A SCHOOL DINNER
WHICH WAS MINCE,CARROTS AND MASHED     
POTATOES FOLLOWED BY DOUGHNUTS OR AN   
APPLE. AFTER TAKING THE AFTERNOON      
REGISTERS ROUND I PLAYED PIGGY BACKS   
WITH MY FRIENDS.DURING AFTERNOON SCHOOL
I FINISHED THE SAMPLER I HAVE BEEN     
MAKING AND READ MY BOOK CALLED "THE    
PHOENIX AND THE CARPET" UNTIL 15.00.   </content>
