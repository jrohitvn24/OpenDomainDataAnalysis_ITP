 good idea to build a{sports hall      
 in Burwell.A{committee}was formed to  
 raise the large sum needed.It{opened  
{this year}and can fit 4 full- size    
 badminton courts and a proper tennis  
 court.When fully finished,upstairs    
 will be carpeted.It will have a bar,  
 snooker,table-tennis and space-       
 invaders.                             
 About 40 people go to{badminton}each  
 week and about 25 for people go to    
{judo.}They have nearly{300 members.   
 There are lots of other activities    
 such as{5-a-side football, aerobics   
 and{tennis.}Next term there will new  
 clubs for gymnastics, dads'evenings   
 and mother and child groups.          
 In the long holiday things have been  
 planned for children by volunteers    
 from the community.
