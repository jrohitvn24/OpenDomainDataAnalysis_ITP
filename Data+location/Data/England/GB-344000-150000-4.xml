		<content> THE GROWING OF STRAWBERRIES IN THE{   
{CHEDDAR VALLEY}WAS STARTED IN THE     
 1860'S.THE RAILWAY LINE AND STATION IN
{DRAYCOTT}VILLAGE HELPED TRANSPORT THE 
 PRODUCE; AT IS HEIGHT THERE WERE FOUR 
 SPECIAL TRAINS TRAVELLING TO {        
{SCOTLAND,}THE{NORTH,}THE {MIDLANDS}AND
{BRISTOL.}IN 1985 THE RAILWAY LINE IS  
 CLOSED, AND THE GROWERS HAVE TO RELY  
 ON LORRIES TO TAKE THEIR STRAWBERRIES 
 TO MARKETS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. THE  
 SOIL, ALTHOUGH VERY FERTILE, WILL     
 BECOME EXHAUSTED, UNLESS IT IS RESTED,
 SOME GROWERS SEED GRASS, AND PUT COWS 
 AND SHEEP ON THEIR FALLOW LAND, OTHERS
 ARE TRYING TO DIVERSIFY AND GROW OTHER
 PRODUCTS SUCH AS LETTUCE, RASPBERRIES,
 BLACKCURRANTS AND LOGANBERRIES. ALSO  
 FIELDS HAVE BEEN OPENED TO THE PUBLIC 
 FOR 'PICK-YOUR-OWN',AND NEW STRAINS OF
 STRAWBERRIES ARE BEING TRIED.
