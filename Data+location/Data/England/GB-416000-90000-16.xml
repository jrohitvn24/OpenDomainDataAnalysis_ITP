		<content> Mr Allen White,a local historian,has  
 carried out research about Mudeford   
 and Stanpit.The earliest record of the
 area was in the original Domesday     
 Survey when 2 manors are mentioned,   
 both called Stanpeta.The population   
 was estimated to be 30.The census in  
 1871 gives the population as 211 males
 and 259 females.                      
 The name 'Stanpit' means stony pit.The
 name Mudeford is thought to originate 
 from'muddy ford'(first reference 1270)
 and not from Mude stream which did not
 receive its name until much later.    
 Mudeford became popular for sea       
 bathing during C18.Adverts in         
 Salisbury Journal 1788,1792 bear this 
 out.Two visits of Goerge111 to a local
 villa(Sandhills)must have             
 helped.Attempts to change the name to 
 Sandford(Mud image being considered   
 inappropriate)were not successful.    </content>
