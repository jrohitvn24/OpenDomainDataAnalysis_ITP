		<content> THE VILLAGE HALL IN RODINGTON IS A NEW
 ONE, BUILT 10 YEARS AGO. IT IS A BRICK
 BUILT BUILDING WITH A FLAT ROOF. IT   
 REPLACES THE TIN BUILDING WHICH USED  
 TO SERVE AS THE VILLAGE HALL. THERE IS
 A LARGE CAR PARK. PLAYING FIELDS, WITH
 AN AREA OF SWINGS AND SLIDES FOR THE  
 CHILDREN, SURROUND IT. THE CHILDREN   
 ARE HOPING TO HAVE A B.M.X. TRACK     
 CONSTRUCTED AT THE FAR END OF THESE   
 PLAYING FIELDS.                       
 INSIDE THE VILLAGE HALL THERE IS A    
 LARGE HALL WITH A WOODEN FLOOR        
 SUITABLE FOR DANCING. (THE LOCAL      
 VILLAGE SCHOOL USES THIS HALL FOR     
 THEIR P.E. LESSONS). THERE IS A STAGE 
 WITH CLOAKROOMS (INCLUDING SHOWERS)   
 AND CHANGING ROOMS BEHIND THIS STAGE. 
 THERE IS A KITCHEN AND ALSO A BAR WITH
 STORAGE SPACE FOR TABLES AND CRATES.
