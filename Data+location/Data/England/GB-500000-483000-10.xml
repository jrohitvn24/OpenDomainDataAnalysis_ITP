		<content> The building of the Seamer &amp; Cross-   
 gates by-pass will commence in 1986.  
 Several alternative routes were       
 proposed to provide a quick &amp; easy    
 route to the east coast.The route     
 chosen will cut down on the unaccept- 
 able level of noise,congestion &amp; fumes
 from the slow moving traffic in summer
 .It will also improve road safety.The 
 route chosen will be,on completion 2.2
 miles in length.It will cost over Â£8. 
 million.The route will start on the   
 A64 and go north east along the side  
 of the existing York to Scarborough   
 railway line.This route is least harm-
 ful as agricultural interests are con-
 cerned.Only one house will be demol-  
 ished &amp; 8 houses will be affected by  
 noise.The public were asked to fill in
 a questionaire for the by-pass.A      
 majority of 69% chose the route which 
 is going to be built.                 </content>
