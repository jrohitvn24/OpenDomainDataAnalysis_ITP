		<title>18Mark's Houses</title>
		<content> Most of the{houses}have been built    
 along the main B3139 road - The       
 Causeway which runs between Highbridge
 and Wells. Newer houses are now being 
 built farther back from the main road 
 The majority of the older houses are  
 made of Wedmore Stone. The newer ones 
 tend to be of brick.One interesting   
 house is the old{Police Station}which 
 ceased to be in 1975. Built in 1932,it
 is made of brick covered with         
 roughcast. The roof tiles are Tegula  
 semi-circle tiles on Imbrick,a slate  
 with supports to hold on the          
 semi-circles. It is now a detached    
 private dwelling. There are           
 approximately 950 houses in Mark,some 
 are over 250 years old and others are 
 just a month old.Many people have     
 lived here all their lives but there  
 are new families and retired people   
 moving into the area.                 </content>
