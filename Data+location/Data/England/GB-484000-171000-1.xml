		<content> Our survey area covers most of        
 Binfield including the village centre,
 and 5 of the 10 hamlets in Warfield.  
 The area comes under the jurisdiction 
 of Bracknell District Council. In 1981
 Binfield had 3,091 inhabitants, while 
 Warfield had just 1,609. The land is  
 predominantly clay and gravel, used   
 almost exclusively for agriculture.   
 Warfield, originally a Saxon          
 settlement,is recorded in The Domesday
 Book and probably derives its name    
 from a clearing or field beside a     
 pool. Scattered hamlets developed from
 single farms and the church lay       
 isolated at the centre. The author of 
 "The Origin of Finger Printing", Sir  
 William Herschel lived at Rectory     
 House. Warfield Hall was once the home
 of Sir Charles Brownlow. He did much  
 for the village and also built a      
 community hall-known as Brownlow Hall.</content>
