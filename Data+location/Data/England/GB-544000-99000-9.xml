		<title>09SCHOOLING IN NEWHAVEN</title>
		<content> There are four main centres of        
 education in the Newhaven area: a     
 Further Education Centre, three       
 Primary schools and four Playgroups.  
 The Further Education Centre is       
 divided into a tutorial unit, built in
 1983, with 20 pupils and 2 teachers,  
 and an Adult Education Centre opened  
 in 1963 with 2,500 students and 55    
 staff.  Adult Education, particularly 
 in crafts, is popular in Newhaven,    
 with 167 different courses offered.   
 Primary schools are: Southdown with   
 215 pupils: Meeching 170 children and 
 Grays for infants, with 148 pupils.   
 Meeching and Grays opened in 1970.    
 Each school has its own atmosphere and
 enthusiasms.  Southdown, for example, 
 is particularly good at sport.  The   
 favourite subjects for most Primary   
 school children are English, Computing
 and Woodwork.                         </content>
