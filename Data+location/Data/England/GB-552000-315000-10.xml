		<title>10TRANSPORT</title>
		<content> Walpole is fairly quiet and away from 
 main roads,but CARS are the most      
 common type of transport.Nearly every 
 family has one.Nearly all of the      
 children have a BICYCLE and 40% cycle 
 to school in the summer.The most      
 popular kind of bicycle is B.M.X.     
 A few of the children own their own   
 PONIES and ride them for pleasure.    
 There are no TRAINS now.The Sutton    
 Bridge _ Kings Lynn line was closed in
 the 1960's.A few men keep BOATS ON THE
 RIVER Nene mainly for fishing.Still   
 the most common form of moving about  
 the village is on FOOT.There is a     
 BUS service to Wisbech and Kings -    
 Lynn.The Wisbech bus runs daily but   
 the Kings - Lynn service is Tuesday   
 and Saturday only.
