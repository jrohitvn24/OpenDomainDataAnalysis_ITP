		<title>10Elston Windmill</title>
		<content> The windmill in Elston is called a    
 Tower Mill.It is 15m 24cm high and the
 walls are 32cm thick.The windmill used
 to be called the Black Giant of Elston
 because it was black then, but now    
 it's grey. It's about 150 years old.  
      There are 5 flights of stairs.On 
 the 2nd flight there is a door that   
 leads outside and you can walk around 
 the mill.Mrs Lawrence has been living 
 in the mill for 7 years.              
      They have to have bricks laid in 
 a special way, one row plain and one  
 row header.                           
      A long time ago, a boy was       
 watching the men changing the         
 sails,when one dropped on top of him  
 and his head went into the ground.  In
 1940 the sails were taken down because
 the German bombers used the sails as a
 marker because R.A.F Syerston was just
 behind it.                            </content>
