		<title>05Brighton By-Pass</title>
		<content>  Funded by the Department of Transport
 this is proposed to skirt the edge of 
 existing development.Commencing at    
 Shoreham it will follow a cutting     
 through Benfield and Foredown Hills   
 to a junction at Hangleton,where a    
 link road down West Hove golf course  
 will connect it to the Old Shoreham   
 Road.The trunk road will continue to  
 the Lewes Road.                       
  The by-pass will remove unnecessary  
 traffic from the town centre,relieve  
 pressure on side routes and serve as a
 barrier to further encroachment on the
 Downs.                                
  It would make an impact on the       
 landscape as it passes through areas  
 of outstanding natural beauty.Cuttings
 and embankments, streetlights and     
 signs would be needed.The plan also   
 involves a net loss of 230 houses and 
 a noise insulation measure of 810.    </content>
