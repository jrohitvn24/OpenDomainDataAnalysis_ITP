		<content>{Stockton Norton C.E.P. Controlled     
{School}is very old because my         
 friend's dad used to come to school   
 here.  We have 2 teachers, and 30     
 primary children in school now.       
   Children start school here in the   
 term when they become 5, and transfer 
 to The Endowed Comprehensive School,  
 Bridgnorth when they are 11.          
   The school is in Stockton Parish,   
 and has the old building, a           
 demountable classroom, a playground   
 and the use of the large School Field.
 Dinners are cooked and eaten at The   
 Village Hall.                         
{Cotsbrook Community School}is a part  
 of Bryn Alyn Community, Wrexham,      
 Clwyd.                                
 There are 60 residential places for   
 secondary children.  It is a Special  
 Education Boarding School for Children
 in Care.                              </content>
