  There are many  kinds of houses in   
 Wansford.  The most common houses are 
 semi_detached and terraced            
 cottages.  In addition there are some 
 detached houses.  The largest house is
 THE HAYCOCK HOTEL. Most of the big    
 houses have got big gardens.  Some    
 have front gardens.  Some have back   
 gardens.  All of the gardens are well 
 looked after.  Most of the houses are 
 made of stone.  Some at the north end 
 of the village are made of new stone  
 and all the old houses roofs are made 
 of slates.  They often have old       
 latticed windows although some of them
 have just had new windows put in.     
  Most houses were made in the         
 seventeenth century and some of the   
 houses  are 500 years old but are     
 still standing.
