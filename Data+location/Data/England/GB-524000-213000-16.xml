		<title>16DIGSWELL LAKE</title>
		<content> I think Digswell Lake is very         
 interesting because of all the        
 nature.It is a very nice setting with 
 lots of trees and flowers for the     
 insects to live in.The reason we went 
 to Digswell Lake was to study the     
 birds there.We saw a Spotted          
 Flycatcher,(which is very rare).We    
 also saw moorhens,coots, and          
 mallards.We got into groups and had   
 Mums to lead us.As you can guess there
 is a lake there, in it are some       
 water-boatman, I drew one.Once or     
 twice we saw a pike, which is         
 sometimes called'The Robber of the    
 Water'.In groups we had things to do  
 like Pond Dipping, Insect Finding and 
 Going Bird Spotting.
