		<content>{Pop music}uses a lot of electronic    
 instruments and machines. Guitars and 
 synthesisers are the most popular.    
 Most music is made by a{group}with    
 drums, guitars and keyboard including 
 a synthesisers as the principal       
 sounds. Many{groups}play their music  
 all over the world to large audiences.
 In their stage shows there are lots of
 light effects and lasers.             
 Scarborough's Futurist Theatre is     
 often a venue for{pop groups.}The     
{groups}hire articulated lorries to    
 ferry their expensive equipment. Along
 with these are a crew of technicians  
 who prepare and service it all. The   
 tickets for a show can range from Â£2  
 to Â£10. Many{groups}dye their hair    
 different colours and dress in odd    
 ways. Young people copy the{groups    
 and dance in  one of Scarborough's    
 many discos till early morning.       </content>
