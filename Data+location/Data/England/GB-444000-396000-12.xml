		<title>12POTTERY POND, SWINTON</title>
		<content>   A popular outing for the family is  
 to the Pottery Pond at the site of the
 old Rockingham Pottery in Swinton.    
 The Flint Mill Pond and the Waterloo  
 Kiln are all that remain of the       
 pottery business.  The pottery was    
 made famous by the patronage of the   
 Marquis of Rockingham.  When children 
 go there they like to dip for tadpoles
 and small fish.  There are pleasant   
 paths to walk around and a neat little
 park and picnic area.  The Waterloo   
 Kiln is the biggest ever built by the 
 Rockingham Company.  It was built     
 after the British Victory at the      
 Battle of Waterloo in 1815.
