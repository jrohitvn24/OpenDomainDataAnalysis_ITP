		<content> The South_Western area of Basingstoke 
 is most notable for the sharp contrast
 between the traditional rural village 
 environment and intensive modern      
 housing development.                  
 The area known as{Brighton Hill}is    
 entirely a product of the 1970's and  
 early 1980's. It was brought about by 
 the assisted migration of industry    
 from London to the cheaper area of    
 Basingstoke. Brighton Hill was        
 therefore one Basingstoke's  many     
 satellite housing estates constructed 
 to accommodate the accompanying       
 workforces.                           
 The M3 motorway forms the southern    
 boundary of the estate _ beyond it    
 lies open, unspoilt farmland in the   
 midst of which lies the village of {  
{Cliddesden. }                         
                                       
                                       </content>
