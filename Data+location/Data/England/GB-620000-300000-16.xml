		<content> There is only one school in our area: 
 a primary school in Lower Stoke Holy  
 Cross (GR229018) which takes children 
 aged 4-11 from Lower and Upper Stoke  
 Holy Cross, Caistor St. Edmunds and   
 Shotesham. It has a staff of 1        
 headteacher, and five assistants. They
 transfer to Framlingham Earl High     
 School from the age of 11-16. The     
 children from Swardeston travel to    
 Mulbarton First School (4-8yrs)       
 Mulbarton Middle School (8-12yrs) and 
 Hethersett High School (11-16yrs)     
 Newton Flotman Primary School takes   
 the children from Swainsthorpe from   
 4-11, whilst those aged 11-16 attend  
 Long Stratton High School. All travel 
 by motor coach.                       
 Those requiring further education     
 after 16 attend the Norwich City      
 College and then proceed to University
 or College of Further Education.      </content>
