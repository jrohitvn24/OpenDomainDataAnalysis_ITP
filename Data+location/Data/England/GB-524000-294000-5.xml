		<title>05The Vicar of Whittlesey 1</title>
		<content>   As the vicar of Whittlesey I look   
 after three churches each with a      
 congregation of about 100.            
   The congregation is not all old     
 people it is a mixture but there are  
 more old people than young. The people
 come from all over Whittlesey though  
 of course more people go to the church
 in their own parish.                  
   The parish stretches from Thorney to
 Pondersbridge which is about 6 miles, 
 and from Kings Delph to Coats which is
 about 5 miles.                        
   The parish population is now about  
 10,000 people, of these only a very   
 small percentage now attend church    
 regularly each sunday.  The churches  
 are the Church of Saint Andrew and the
 Church of Saint Mary.  They are to be 
 found on the east and west sides of   
 Whittlesey.
