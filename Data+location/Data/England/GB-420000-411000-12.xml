		<title>12HORSE RIDING</title>
		<content> I go to Elm Trees Riding stables in   
 Skelmanthorpe. I go every Saturday at 
 9.00am till 3.00pm. I help to groom,  
 tack up,muck out and lead the horses. 
 I stay all day.The stables have about 
 16 horses. Before our dinner we have  
 to make the feeds and give the horses 
 water. The feed consists of sugarbeet 
 and bran. At 12.30 I have my dinner   
 with about four other girls.          
     At 2.00 I have a ride. I sometimes
 go out on a hack. I sometimes do      
 cantering and jumping in the all      
 weather track. An all weather track is
 made of a ditch filled with stones.   
 Over the stones is a layer of soil and
 a big piece of plastic covering is    
 placed over the soil. Hard wood       
 chippings are used on top of the      
 plastic covering to create soft ground
 for the horses.                       
                                       </content>
