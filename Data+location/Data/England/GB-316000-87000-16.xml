		<content> I used to get up when my Dad called me
 at 6 o'clock in the morning. My first 
 job was to take my Dad and Mum a cup  
 of tea in bed .I then used to get my  
 two horses from the field into the    
 stable where I fed and groomed them.  
 I would have my breakfast at 7.30 a.m.
 I left the milking for my brother, who
 had to hand milk two cows. I would    
 harness up the horses. I would lead   
 the horses into the field which I was 
 going to plough. I hitched the horses 
 up to the plough and I ploughed the   
 field until dinner time when I took   
 the horses in for their mid-day feed, 
 mean while having my own dinner.      
  After dinner  my father said we would
 sow the field of corn . I took the    
 seed corn to the field in the cart. My
 Father started sowing the corn by hand
 from a seed lip which he carried on   
 his arm.                              </content>
