		<content>{Babbinswood Farm}belongs to{Mr. and   
{Mrs.T.B.Jones.}They own 120 cattle    
 which produce about 2000 litres of    
 milk every day.Two milktankers come   
 daily to collect the milk.The parlour 
 is cleaned after every milking and so 
 is the shed where the cows line up    
 for milking. Some cows are dry and    
 they have blue dye on their legs.All  
 the cows have names and numbers on    
 their buttocks.The breeds of cows are 
 Friesian,Limosin and Hereford.In the  
 yard there is a Lagoon where they put 
 all the waste cow manure that is      
 scraped out of the sheds.Mr.Jones has 
 a computer in the farmhouse which     
 controls the feeding.Cows wear yellow 
 neckbands so that when an animal puts 
 its head into the feeding box,a sensor
 signals the computer which releases   
 the required amount of food.
