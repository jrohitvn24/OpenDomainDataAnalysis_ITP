		<content> Nearly everyone has a cassette        
 recorder.These are machines from which
 the sound is taken off a tape less    
 than 1cm wide.{Cassette}means little  
 box.They are used mainly to listen to 
 or record music,but now they are very 
 good for use with{home computers.}Most
 of the games which are used to program
 the machine.Home computers are        
 becoming very popular.Children like   
 them because they can play many good  
 games like{Blagger,Chuckie_Egg}and {  
{Monsters.Video recorders}are good     
 because we can see any film we want   
 to,in our own house.We can also record
 T.V. programmes too,so we do not miss 
 anything.It is easy to load the tape  
 and watch it when you want to.
