		<title>12LIFE STYLES - PETWORTH RURAL</title>
		<content> Everyone questioned takes regular     
 holidays - one farmer and his wife    
 having a foreign holiday every        
 alternate year. Despite the           
 stringency of farming work there is   
 plenty of recreation available all the
 year. There are no Public Houses in   
 the area - The Fox is now a private   
 house. The nearest is at Kirdford.    
 Social visiting is either with one's  
 family or other farmers. There is a   
 local Agricultural Association meeting
 at Petworth. At Gownfold the wife is a
 Committee member of Wisborough Green  
 Women's Institute, and she and her    
 husband are members of the Church     
 Fellowship, meeting in private houses.
 The nearest church is at Kirdford,    
 which the Gownfold family attend. At  
 Marshall's farm the family go to the  
 Young Farmers' Church at Ebernoe. Few 
 of those interviewed go to any church.</content>
