		<title>16GUITING POWER.LIGHT INDUSTRY</title>
		<content>    In Guiting Power there is a light- 
 engineering business.They work with   
 metal,designing,making and repairing. 
 Just now, they are making railings,   
 barbecues and an aircraft crash tender
 for overseas. They use drills,lathes, 
 welding-irons,milling machines,saws   
 and guillotines which run on petrol,  
 diesel,paraffin or electricity.       
 Supplies come from Cheltenham,        
 Gloucester or Birmingham.All the      
 machines together use only as much    
 fuel as an ordinary house.            
    The business is 5 years old.There  
 are 3-4 workers.Most of the customers 
 are farmers,builders,quarries and     
 fire-engine companies and they learn  
 of the business by word of mouth, as  
 advertising is very expensive.
