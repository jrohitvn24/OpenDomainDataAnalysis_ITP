		<title>05SARAH MONK'S SUNDAY</title>
		<content> I am Sarah Monk. I am 11 years old and
 I live in Hadfield. On Sunday I get up
 at about 10 am   and have a big       
 breakfast. At 11 am my Mum and I go to
 my Gran's at Denton about 5 miles     
 away. We don't get back till 3 pm.    
 While we are at Gran's Dad plays golf.
 Dad doesn't get home until 5 pm. Then 
 we have tea which is Sunday dinner.   
 All we do then is watch T.V.          
   I clean out the rabbits then have a 
 nice hot bath to get all the rabbit   
 mess off me. I get out of the bath and
 put my dressing gown on.              
   I go downstairs and play Blackjack  
 with my Mum until I go to bed at      
 9.30 pm. I then read for about ten    
 minutes before going to sleep.        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
