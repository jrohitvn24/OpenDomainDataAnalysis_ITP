 Our area has two policemen            
 permanently allocated                 
 to it.One lives in Forest Row.The     
 C.I.D. at East Grinstead covers the   
 area.Community policing has been      
 introduced and it has been a          
 success.One officer works on the      
 Herontyre Estate though 5 officers    
 work in our block.From Jan. to March  
 1985 5 house burglaries were          
 committed,8 other burglaries,5 cases  
 of vandalism, 1 assault, 1 misuse of  
 drugs, and 1 misuse of a forged bank  
 note.So far,50% have been solved,10%  
 up on last year.The large rural houses
 attract many burglars though poaching 
 is not a problem.
