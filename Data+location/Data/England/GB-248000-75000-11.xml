		<content>   Polypressions is a business that    
 makes plastic moulds for electric hand
 driers.The moulds are made out of     
 plastic resin and reinforced with     
 fibre glass.The plastic resin used for
 the moulds comes from Scotland and    
 from Cheshire and the fibre glass     
 comes from France or America.They have
 great problems getting their raw      
 materials from their suppliers but no 
 problems getting their product to the 
 buyers.                               
   The person who owns the company     
 lives at Gunnislake and has one       
 employee who lives at Brentor.The     
 business has been going for several   
 years,but they have only been on this 
 site for one month.They chose that    
 site because the plastic resin gives  
 off an unpleasant smell,so this is an 
 ideal place because there are not many
 houses around that area.              </content>
