 most. We found the most popular activ-
 ities were swimming{22%}, walking for 
 pleasure{21%}, reading{17%}and aero-  
 bics and keep fit{17%}, all cheap and 
 relaxing. The facilities for these are
 easily available. The swimming baths  
 are in the town. The other things     
 people enjoy are music, keepfit, golf,
 cycling, football, snooker, squash,   
 knitting, dancing, rock hunting, gym  
 nastics, gardening, boating, riding,  
 tennis, running, pool, volley ball,   
 fishing, water sports, hockey, ski-   
 ing, skating, and karate. When asked  
 about their favourite sport{65%}of    
 the people watch their leisure on T.V.
{14% }of people watch their sport      
 live,{21%}did not specify live or on  
 T.V. So many people watch their sport 
 on T.V. probably because it is cheap. </content>
