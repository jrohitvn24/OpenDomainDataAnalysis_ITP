		<title>12TRANSPORT THROUGH GRAFTON</title>
		<content> The A439 runs through our area and    
 lorries pass through carrying goods   
 from Warwick and Leamington Spa       
 to Evesham and Gloucester. It is also 
 a popular holiday route.We did a      
 traffic survey and cars were far more 
 numerous than lorries.  There were not
 so many lorries about 20 years ago    
 because the railway was open and      
 people used to walk from Temple       
 Grafton on the way to Binton to go    
 to work by train. Before then         
 people travelled by boat and          
 transported things like coal and      
 timber to Stratford. A more modern way
 of travelling is by 'bus and there are
 four 'bus routes which pass through   
 our area - Stratford to Evesham along 
 one main road - Stratford to Evesham  
 through Welford and Stratford to      
 Evesham via Temple Grafton once in the
 morning and once in the evening.      </content>
