		<title>15ENTERTAINMENT-MY SATURDAY</title>
		<content> Because my mum is a cook she sometimes
 has to prepare food for weddings.The  
 weddings normally take place on a     
 Saturday.My mum gets up at about      
 6.00 a.m. to prepare the food.She     
 makes sandwiches,buys meats ,makes    
 potato salads (chopped, cooked        
 potatoes with salad cream),rice       
 salads(rice with vegetables).She buys 
 coleslaw,pork pie,pickles,beetroot,   
 tomatoes, lettuce and eggs.She cooks  
 sausage rolls and makes sausages on   
 sticks.Afterwards people can have a   
 variety of cakes,gateaux and          
 trifles.When the food is prepared my  
 mum and I drive to the place where the
 buffet is held.We unload the food and 
 set it up on tables.When the people   
 arrive it is my job to collect up     
 sherry,wine and champagne glasses.I   
 also collect plates,knifes and forks.I
 get paid Â£2 to Â£3 for helping.        </content>
