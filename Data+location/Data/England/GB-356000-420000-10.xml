		<title>10Houses in Clayton-le-Woods</title>
		<content>   On the estate on which I live most  
 of the{houses}are semi-detached, but  
 there is still one farm house.        
   On the main road the houses and     
 bungalows were built earlier, are all 
 different designs and are more        
 expensive to buy.                     
   Most of the houses on the new       
 estates are privately owned and are a 
 mixture of detached, semi-detached,   
 terraced houses and bungalows.        
   There is also a small development of
 houses - semi-detached, detached and  
 some two story flats - for rent.      
                                       
   At Clayton Green there are some much
 older houses, some of which were      
{handloom weavers}cottages. One was the
{toll house}on the turnpike which is   
 now the A6 road.
