		<content> The area undulates from 70 to 100     
 metres above sea level over glacier   
 moraine. Good arable farmland is      
 interspaced with pasture and wooded   
 areas, divided by hedges. The steep   
{Cleveland escarpment}lies immediately 
 to the south, the{Tees plain}to the   
 north. Swainby Beck gives natural     
 drainage into the Leven. The remaining
 area is artificially drained into the 
 Wiske. Swainby Church steeple is the  
 most distinctive man-made feature,    
 dominating the scene. Old houses lie  
 beside a pretty stream with well kept 
 banksides and railings. Two stone     
 bridges and a wooden footbridge add   
 character. Modern houses are hidden   
 behind the traditional facade of      
 terraced housing. Ten young trees were
 planted in 1983 to replace lost elms, 
 and more in the churchyard. At Potto, 
 private garders are a feature.        </content>
