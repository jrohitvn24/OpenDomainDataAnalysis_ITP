		<title>02New Forest-Camping and Deer</title>
		<content> This area includes a site to the south
 of the B3055 for camping and for      
 caravans. This is an open grassy site 
 on the edge of woodland where it      
 changes into moorland.                
 From here many walks can be taken into
 the surrounding area, either across   
 open moorland or along the many paths 
 and gravel roads of the inclosures.   
 There are well sign-posted car parks  
 situated on the edges of the          
 inclosures from where the day visitor 
 can explore the vicinity.             
 Throughout this area New Forest{ponies
 can be seen and in particular, there  
 are deer, as part of these inclosures 
 is used for{Deer Research.}The deer   
 may be spotted if the visitor is very 
 quiet and keeps to the pathways. Also 
 there is an immense variety of plant, 
 insect and bird life to be seen.
