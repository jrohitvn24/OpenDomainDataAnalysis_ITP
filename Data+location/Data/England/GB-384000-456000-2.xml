		<content>    Hellifield School is designated    
 'County Primary' and is a             
 co-educational school catering for    
 children in the 4+ to 10+ age range.  
    The fifty-nine children on roll are
 arranged in three classes according to
 age.                                  
    Pre-school children enjoy a Play   
 Group which meets in the Village      
 Institute two mornings a week.        
    The school's resources include a   
 large playground and a field developed
 into a study area. The latter contains
 a pond, gardens for the pupils to     
 cultivate, a greenhouse, a 'wild area'
 and a number of trees.                
    A Parent-Teachers Association      
 arranges educational, social and fund 
 raising events. Evening use of the    
 building includes a Youth Club, Scouts
 and Guides, Women's Institute and     
 educational classes.                  </content>
