		<content> serving vicar was probably            
 Rev.Homan-Berry who was vicar for 23  
 years.                                
  The Church is built of red bricks in 
 the old English style and consists of 
 a single aisle,a Chancel,sanctuaries  
 and vestries.                         
   The Parish Church of St. Mary's ,   
 Dudleston is set on a elevated site in
 the middle of the village .It is of   
 Norman origin, but has seen extensive 
 alterations in Victorian times,       
 including new side aisles,new chancel 
 and tower. Points of interest are the 
 fine hammer-beam roof, the Saxon      
 preaching cross in the churchyard and 
 the heavily carved Jacobean pulpit.   
 The parish is now joined with Criftins
 and Dudleston Heath and shares the    
 incumbent.                            
   The Methodists are served by the    
{Main Road Chapel}and{Chapel Lane.}    </content>
