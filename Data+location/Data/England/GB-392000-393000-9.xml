		<title>09Manchester to Haughton Green</title>
		<content> The Anderson family moved to Haughton 
 Green from Miles Platting in 1964.    
 They found Haughton Green very quiet  
 at first and very open and green after
 the overcrowded conditions of their   
 former environment.Their new house was
 on the edge of the{Manchester         
{Overspill Estate}and it overlooked    
 Hulme's Wood.Their 4 daughters were   
 then aged from 7 weeks to 8 years and 
 all have grown up here,attending      
 Corrie Primry school and Two Trees    
 Secondary.Mr.Anderson is a postman in 
 Manchester.Mrs.Anderson works locally 
 as a primary school secratary.They    
 enjoy living so close to the woods and
 the house has a large garden,3        
 bedrooms and a roomy, well-equiped    
 kitchen.They are now buying the house.
 The family all agree that moving to{  
{Haughton Green}was a very good idea.
