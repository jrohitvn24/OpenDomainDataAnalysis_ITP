		<content>    {The baker }calls  on  Mondays  and
 Thursdays  and {two  milkmen}share the
 trade on alternate days.{No travelling
{shops}reach Yanworth.                 
     The  village  {shop / post  office
 closed around 1954/1955.  In different
 premises  the post office continued to
 sell a limited range of bacon,  sugar,
 sweets etc.  until  it  closed  around
 1968/1969. From a private house it was
 possible  to  buy  some cigarettes and
 chocolate until 1981/1982.            
    {The census  revealed  that  80% of
{the households had a car  _ only 9% of
{pensioners lived in households without
{a car. } Perhaps this is  just as well
 for  while   most  rural   communities
 depend on private transport for travel
 to work  and  entertainment, {Yanworth
{people  more  than  most rely on their
{cars  for  obtaining  their basic food
{requirements.                         </content>
