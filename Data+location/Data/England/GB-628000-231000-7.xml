		<content>The Suffolk Coastal District Council   
spends 20-30 thousand pounds a year on 
sea defences. A new wall has been built
along the Felixstowe coast from the    
ferry. The Anglian Water Board is finis
hing building this. Heavy machines, cra
nes and dumpers are extending it to Lan
dgaurd point. This Landguard scheme    
will have cost 880,000 pounds by the   
end of 1985 and 550m of sea wall will  
have been built. The wall design is att
ractive but was not built with tourism 
in mind. Since the big floods of 1953, 
when the Orwell river flooded our area 
the new freighter terminals at the dock
have been built above the old sea wall 
level and so make a type of sea defence
The most vulnerable place is the Land- 
guard end of Felixstowe. In emergencies
the police set off sirens and may evac-
uate people. Pupils from Langer School 
were last evacuated in 1977.           </content>
