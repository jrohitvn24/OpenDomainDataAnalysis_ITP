		<content> In writing our 20 pages of information
 we decided to write about ourselves,  
 what we do, what we like and the      
 things we do in our lives. Although we
 live in the countryside it is         
 intensively farmed with many of the   
 fields being made by digging out the  
 hedges of 2,3 or 4 smaller fields to  
 make them larger.The crops we saw     
 growing when we did the survey were   
 wheat and barley with a lot of oilseed
 rape this year and 2 fields of peas.  
 The other thing we noticed was that   
 many of the public footpaths were     
 blocked up, either by farmers         
 ploughing them up or because they     
 were overgrown. This made access to   
 the countryside much more difficult   
 for us when we were doing our survey.
