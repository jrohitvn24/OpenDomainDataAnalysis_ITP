		<title>20Our views on the Domesday</title>
		<content>The best part of doing the Domesday    
Survey to us, was the going out to     
explore around our village with our    
friends and teacher.                   
One thing we really enjoyed was typing 
all our information onto the computer  
and being able to then read it back. We
have now made a class book with all our
data in.                               
                                       
We would like to thank all those who   
helped us with our survey.             
                                       
                                       
                                       
From all the children in Junior 1 at   
Oakley School aged 7-9 years.
