		<title>11LANDSCAPE OF MARSKE AREA.</title>
		<content> Marske lies in a South facing hollow  
 surrounded by beautiful woodlands in a
 landscape that is rich in variety. The
 houses are close together on two      
 levels with the Church a little lower,
 and the distant view is of the green  
 slopes of Downholme topped by a fringe
 of trees and the sharp edge of a steep
 scar. A low wooded hill behind the    
 Village gives shelter and below are   
 ornamental gardens of Marske Hall and 
 farmland that undulates gently towards
 the river Swale. From the North East  
 the Marske Beck flows through the     
 valley with a prominent limestone     
 cliff rising sheer to pasture and     
 moorland, and the cottages of Clints  
 nestle against the conifers that cling
 to it's rocky outcrop. A 16th century 
 bridge with ribbed arches crosses the 
 beck below the Village. Here the road 
 starts to climb towards Marrick.      </content>
