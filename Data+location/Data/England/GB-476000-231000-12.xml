		<title>12Family Service at St. James</title>
		<content> The parish church of St.James in Great
Horwood is a very active centre of     
village life. Although the church no   
longer has a resident rector regular   
services are held there.               
  Morning Family services begin there  
at 10.30 a.m. People like to sit in    
more or less the same place each week. 
The first thing that happens is that   
the organist begins to play and the    
choir processes in.The service begins  
with the notices followed by a short   
prayer. Next we sing a hymn or a psalm.
After that is a Bible reading. The     
sermon is optional! - if people don't  
want to listen they can go into the    
Tower Room for a discussion. Most      
adults choose the sermon,whilst most   
young people choose the discussion.    
Throughout toddlers are encouraged to  
express themselves as they wish.
