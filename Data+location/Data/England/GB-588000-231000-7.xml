		<title>07Farming Fruit Apples Pears</title>
		<content>    We went to a fruit farm.  The      
 farmer's main crop is apples, but he  
 has other crops such as pears, wheat  
 and barley.  He also grows peony      
 flowers for the seeds.                
   The farm is about l00 acres and is  
 mainly in one block.  The farmer who  
 runs this farm is the owner.  He lives
 in the farmhouse, which is            
 approximately 250 years old.  He has  
 ten helpers but at picking time there 
 are as many as 50 pickers.            
    Between the trees in the orchard   
 there are many bee hives for          
 pollination.                          
    New  trees come from nurseries in  
 England but some come from Holland and
 Belgium.  When the apples are picked  
 they are graded, packed and sent to   
 all parts of the United Kingdom via   
 Chelmsford.                           
                                       </content>
