		<content> Geoff Harris and Gayna Johnson are two
 clowns who live in a house called "Sea
 View".Geoff has been a clown for five 
 years.His best tricks are fire eating 
 and diving through a hoop of          
 fire.After leaving school Geoff did a 
 course in London for a fortnight,then 
 he went to college in Winchester,where
 he got his drama teaching             
 qualifications so he now teaches drama
 in Loughborough.He has written three  
 plays."Mother Goose"," Merry Christmas
 Jake" and" Who fears to die?"and has  
 written lots more for use by his drama
 group.Gayna has been a clown for      
 nearly 3 years.She can do fire tricks 
 but when she and Geoff do their act   
 Geoff does them because he is         
 better.Gayna only likes doing things  
 in front of an audience dressed up as 
 a character.She teaches cookery to    
 children aged 11-16 in Coventry.      </content>
