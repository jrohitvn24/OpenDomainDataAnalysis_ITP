		<title>11WILMINGTON BRIDGE : HULL.</title>
		<content> There are several bridges that cross  
 the River Hull.Most of them carry road
 traffic and one is used for railway   
 transport.                            
    The Wilmington Swing Bridge is     
 unusual,however,because although it is
 an impressive bridge with a cabin     
 perched aloft,it is only used for     
 pedestrians and cycles.               
    It was not built for this purpose- 
 it was formerly used as a railway     
 bridge- but the track was taken up    
 several years ago.Since it is a public
 right of way it must still be manned  
 to swing open when large ships want to
 move up or down river.                
    Nowadays it is very peaceful and   
 you can often see anglers casting     
 their lines in the shadow of the      
 bridge, for flounders or eels,away    
 from the roar of the traffic and the  
 rumble of the trains.                 </content>
