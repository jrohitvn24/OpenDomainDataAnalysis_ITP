		<title>16THE BLACKSMITH</title>
		<content> The blacksmith in Kirkburton has been 
 working since 1949.He started being a 
 blacksmith because he liked horses    
 when he was young.He has not worked   
 anywhere else while being a blacksmith
 The place where the blacksmith works  
 was built in 1915.It used to be an old
 house and you can still see the       
 remains of the stair case and the     
 mantle piece.He is the only blacksmith
 in his family and he says he would not
 change his job for another one.He does
 hotshoeing and coldshoeing.He shoes   
 about 5 to 6 horses a day.One of the  
 serious accidents is where he broke   
 his finger when a horse trod on it and
 it will not mend.Sometimes he makes   
 brackets for shelves but he does not  
 make a lot of gates for he has not got
 the time.                             
                                       
                                       </content>
