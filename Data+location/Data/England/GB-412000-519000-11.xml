		<content> A former Blacksmith's shop can be seen
 and the discerning visitor will find  
 many places of interest. Staindrop is 
 one of County Durham's Green Villages 
 and the whole of the area around the  
 green creates the overall charm and   
 unique character of the village. The  
 green is the focus of village life in 
 times of communal festivities. A      
 measure of the tourist attractions of 
 Staindrop may be found in the         
 visitor's book in St Mary's Church,   
 where it can be seen that people      
 visited the area from all over the    
 world from countries like the U.S.A., 
 Spain, Austria, Denmark, Germany and  
 Canada. During the past 16 months 699 
 people have signed the visitor's book.
