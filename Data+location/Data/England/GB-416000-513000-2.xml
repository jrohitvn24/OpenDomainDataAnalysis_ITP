		<content>  In Eppleby village there are 93      
{houses}and 2{pubs.}The pubs' names are
 The Travellers Rest and the Cross     
 Keys.                                 
 There is one post office, a shop, a   
 village hall, a blacksmith, a craft   
 centre, a riding centre and a police  
 house. There are two{greens}and a bus 
 shelter is on one of the greens.      
  Most{houses}are made of stone. Most  
 brick houses were built about one     
 hundred years ago. More people own    
 houses than rent them. Half of the    
 houses don't have garages. Some of    
 the houses are holiday homes.         
  In 1881 there was 471{people}but in  
 1981 there were only 230 people living
 in Eppleby because some of the houses 
 are empty and there are smaller       
 families living in the houses.
