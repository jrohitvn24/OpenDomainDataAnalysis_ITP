		<title>02Knowle Moor</title>
		<content>  Knowle Moor occupies the north-west  
 corner of the area, covering about two
 square kilometres. It presents a      
 typical picture of farming countryside
 on the Somerset levels.               
 Rich,flat,green pastures are          
 criss-crossed by a grid-like pattern  
 of rhynes,the Somerset version of     
 artifical drainage ditches,many of    
 them marked by hedgerows and willow   
 trees. The drainage was completed in  
 the eighteenth century and today the  
 land is grazed by both cattle and     
 sheep,the majority of the cattle being
 Frisian dairy cows.                   
  Looking north-east across the moor   
 from Bleadney the moor is dominated   
 visually by Knowle Hill,despite its   
 low height of 36 metres maximum. The  
 name "Knowle" keeps recurring,as in   
 Knowle Bridge(crossing the River Axe) 
 and Knowle Farm.                      </content>
