		<content> The Farmhouse Interview.              
                                       
    Today James and I went to Baynhall 
 Farm to interview the farmer there,who
 is called Mr.Venables.He has been     
 living there since 1942,he is married 
 and has 2 children.He has got almost  
 400 acres and                         
 grows;potatoes,sugar,barley,onions,car
 rots and cereals.There isn't much     
 water round his farm,so he has to     
 irrigate his crops when it is dry.    
 His hobbies are photography and squash
 but he isn't one of the most social   
 members of the communtiy because he   
 has to work on the farm most of the   
 time.He goes to church every week and 
 has got a lot of firends in the       
 village.In his opinion housing        
 development is the biggest change as  
 the population ha grown from 800 in   
 1940 to now over 3000.                </content>
