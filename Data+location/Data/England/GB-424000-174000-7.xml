		<content> Housing has spread along the valleys  
 and more recently up the slopes. the  
 older houses in the Conservation Area 
 are constructed of sarsen, chalk and  
 flint with tiles or slates. Most      
 houses are of brick with blocks in    
 recent construction. Older houses make
 some 50% of the total, mostly terraced
 or semi-detached. Some houses are     
 still thatched and there are 3 or 4   
 traditional houses in their own       
 grounds. The housing stock has        
 increased by about one third recently 
 with 42 built in the 1950s, 101 in the
 1960s and 55 in the 1970s. Building   
 continues as 'in-fill' at both the    
 expensive and starter ends of the     
 market. There are some 107 council    
 built houses, some of which are now   
 owner occupied, including flats and   
 bungalows for elderly people in the   
 Whitley area                          </content>
