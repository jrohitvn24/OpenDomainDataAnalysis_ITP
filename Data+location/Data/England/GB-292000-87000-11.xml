		<title>11Father by Graham Aged 8</title>
		<content> At 8.00am my father gets up. He likes 
 tea only for breakfast. He goes to    
 work at 8.50am by car. He is a credit 
 manager. He finishes work at 5.30pm.  
 Father choose his job because the     
 career prospects are very good. He had
 special training for his job which    
 included a lot of courses. he likes   
 meeting people and travelling. He does
 not like the tedious paper work that  
 he has to do. This is his fifth job.  
 In his leisure time he plays bridge,  
 golf and watches soccer. He has a     
 English car. He likes dishes with     
 spicey sauce for dinner and sandwiches
 for tea. He goes to bed at 11.30pm. My
 Father has three people in his family 
 and an Irish Red Setter and goldfish. 
 His house is three years old
