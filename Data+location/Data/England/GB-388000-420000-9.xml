		<content>   Neolith Chemicals is an engineering 
 and chemical works. The company uses  
 high pressure pumps for cleaning and  
 maintenance of buildings. Some of the 
 finest buildings in Britain, America, 
 Holland, Portugal and Hungary have    
 been cleaned by them and in           
 addition they hire pumps to North Sea 
 oil rigs.                             
   The company opened in Shawforth in  
 1971 and has branches in towns as far 
 apart as Aberdeen and Bournemouth,    
 plus two branches outside the United  
 Kingdom, one in Holland and one to be 
 opened in Australia.                  
   Neolith chemicals and high pressure 
 water jetting can be very dangerous.  
 Some of the chemicals can blind you   
 and the small pumps deliver water at a
 force of 2000 pounds per square inch. 
 Only competent stone cleaning         
 contractors are allowed to use them.  </content>
