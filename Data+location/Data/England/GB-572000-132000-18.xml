		<title>18SMUGGLING IN BEDGEBURY AREA</title>
		<content>   Bedgebury area has smuggling legends
 although the more factual accounts    
 concern Goudhurst and Hawkhurst       
 between which Bedgebury Forest lies,  
 e.g. that of the Hawkhurst Gang who   
 terrorised the locality till defeated 
 in a battle at Goudhurst in 1747.     
   The house named Spyways in Goudhurst
 High Street, overlooking the Forest,  
 and Smugley Farm, between Goudhurst   
 and Bedgebury, are both connected with
 smuggling, the latter being where the 
 last local smugglers were arrested.   
   Tubslake, on the east side of the   
 Forest, has a pond reputed to be where
 tubs or kegs of contraband liquor were
 hidden until collected for forwarding.
   Richard Church, the Kentish author, 
 considered the independent outlook and
 good manners of the local people to be
 attributable to the anti-bureaucratic 
 attitude fostered by smuggling!       </content>
