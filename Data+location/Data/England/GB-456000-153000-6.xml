		<content> SSarah is a sixteen year old girl who 
 lives in a family of three. Sarah has 
 lived in the village of Wootton St.   
 Lawrence for three and a half years.  
 As there is no school in the          
 village she went to Cranbourne but now
 she has left. She  finds it boring in 
 the village and she would prefer to   
 live in the town because there is a   
 lot more entertainment. There are very
 few children living in the village. In
 Sarah's spare time she likes to go    
 bell ringing in the church.We asked   
 Sarah if she wanted any changes in the
 village and she said she would like a 
 swimming pool.
