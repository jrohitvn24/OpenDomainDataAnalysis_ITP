		<title>06Farming in Thame</title>
		<content>There are many farms in the Thame area 
and farming is an important part of    
many peoples lives. One of the farms we
visited was Park Meadow Farm. It is    
typical of the farms in our area. Mr.  
Holland, the farmer there, has five    
children: three boys and two girls. Two
of the boys work at Scotsgrove, and the
other has emigrated to New Zealand. The
farmhouse was built by the family in   
1952. The orchard was formed two years 
earlier. The family used to own a dairy
but it had to be shut down. The family 
now makes their living from sheep,     
cattle and corn. Mr. Holland owns 224  
sheep, 273 cattle and a few chickens   
etc. In addition he has 350 acres of   
corn and 260 acres of grassland. Many  
farmers are worried about the closure  
of Thame cattle market.
