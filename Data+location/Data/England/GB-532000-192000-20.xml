		<content> ONE GROUP INTERVIEWED OLD PEOPLE IN   
 EDMONTON. THEY ASKED 'WHAT CHANGES YOU
 WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN NEXT 50 YEARS?'. 
 (1) The most important change I'd like
 to see is to get rid of all the       
 immigrants. Secondly I'd like all the 
 tower blocks and sky scrapers knocked 
 down. Thirdly, I'd like our streets to
 be safer at night and for the police  
 to prevent muggings and rapes.        
             Old lady aged 90.         
 (2) The ugly flats and overcrowding in
 Edmonton Green should be spread out   
 more. "The tower blocks are like      
 rabbit huts way up there in the sky   
 cut off from nature".                 
             Lady aged 75              
 These are some of the changes 9/10    
 year olds wish to see:_More jobs for  
 unemployed,care for wildlife,starving 
 in Africa to be given food,less       
 vandalism,and cure for Cancer.        </content>
