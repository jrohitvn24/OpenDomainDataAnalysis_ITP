 For many families most mornings begin 
 when the children get up to go to     
 school although sometimes their       
 parents have already left for work and
 they may have to get themselves ready,
 and perhaps get other children ready  
 too.There are plenty of things at home
 for entertainment, such as television,
 video machines and computers, but lots
 of children still prefer to play      
 outside the home when they can.  They 
 also enjoy going out with their       
 parents at weekends or playing with   
 their friends. Many are also expected 
 to help with jobs around the house and
 with shopping. There are often pets at
 home too.Older children usually have  
 homework to do in the evenings, which 
 means they don't have much free time  
 during the week, as they have to go to
 bed quite early.                      </content>
