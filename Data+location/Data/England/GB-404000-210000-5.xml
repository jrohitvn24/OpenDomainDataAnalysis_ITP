		<title>05TYPICAL DAY   (CONT)</title>
		<content> Ready.I wash my hands mmm what a nice 
 lunch.When I've finished my lunch I   
 must go and see how my vegetables and 
 flowers are getting on in my garden.  
 They have grown.The Lettuces are ready
 to pick the potatoes are ready to dig 
 and the mint ready for mint sauce.The 
 flowers are lovely too not in full    
 bloom yet but they smell so strong.   
   What can I do next? There's nothing 
 on television that I like,my cat has  
 done a disappearing trick so I can't  
 play with her.The time seems to go so 
 slowly when you're by yourself but    
 when you have a friend it flies away. 
   Tea at last then I spend the rest of
 my evening watching television and    
 doing some sewing.At nine thirty it's 
 time for bed and then again it will be
 time to get up in the morning for     
 another typical day.
