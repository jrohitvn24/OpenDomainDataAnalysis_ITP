 Most of the people interviewed in this
 area were happy with their lives in   
 the country.They had anxieties and    
 most of these were about traffic .The 
 noise of fast cars disturbs the rural 
 tranquillity and, more seriously, fast
 traffic in country lanes can be a     
 danger to life and limb.Speed limits  
 should be set and enforced.Although   
 most admit that the Motorway has      
 brought the advantage of increased    
 accessibility, the loss of farm land  
 and the general increase in local     
 traffic is not welcomed.              
 Walking is a popular activity and many
 get much pleasure from long country   
 walks in peaceful surroundings.
