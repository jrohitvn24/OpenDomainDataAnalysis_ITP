		<title>18Farming and the Trout Farm</title>
		<content>  {Trout Farm}                         
     There is a small trout farm in    
 Barby. They have two tanks of water   
 from which you can select your fish.  
 They also sell vegetables and         
 Christmas trees.                      
                                       
  {Farming}                            
     There has been quite a lot of     
 oil-seed rape planted this year. This 
 seems to be quite a new trend. The    
 farm between Barby and Kilsby also    
 owns land above Kilsby. The lady      
 farmer is a particularly successful   
 sheep farmer. The fields in the valley
 seem to be far bigger and lusher. this
 year has been a very wet year for the 
 farmers. They are having problems     
 drying the crops.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
