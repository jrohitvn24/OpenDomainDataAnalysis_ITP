 We usually have tea at about 17.00 but
 on Monday,Wednesday and Friday it is  
 later because my dad gets in later    
 from work.After our meal I sometimes  
 watch T.V. and then I help mum wash   
 the dishes.After this I either go out 
 to play with my friends or do my      
 homework (if I have any).Between 19.00
 and 20.00 I get ready for bed and     
 watch T.V.until 21.00 when I usually  
 go to bed.

{Recently the school has changed its   
{time of closing from 16.00 to 15.20.  
{This does not appear to have caused   
{any problems.However some working     
{parents have had to make arrangements 
{to have their children looked after   
{until they get home.}
