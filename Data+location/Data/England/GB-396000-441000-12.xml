		<title>12COMMERCE RETAIL SHOPS</title>
		<content> There are eighteen shops in Cowling   
 including a post office and two fish  
 and chip shops.The other shops are    
 butcher,greengrocer,newsagent,antique 
 shop,frozen food shop,health food     
 shop,mini-market(groceries) a         
 haberdashery,an Oxfam shop,two more   
 grocery shops,a bakery,a T.V shop,two 
 hairdressers. Many people rely on the 
 local shops, but some often go to the 
 nearest town to shop because the      
 supermarket prices are lower and there
 is a larger choice.                   
 Many shops have closed over the years 
 as shopping habits have changed.Older 
 people can remember when there were   
 far more small shops selling a range  
 of goods and services in the village. 
 At one time,it is said,you would not  
 need to go out of the village at all  
 as everything you might need was sold 
 somewhere in Cowling.                 </content>
