		<title>14THE KENNELS</title>
		<content>       We went to the kennels,         
 which is a place where people leave   
 their cats and dogs when they go on   
 holiday.We saw 4 cats and 5 dogs.Mrs  
 Barnes the owner also has 3 dogs of   
 her own, they were all border         
 collies.The dogs are only let out one 
 at a time because they may start      
 fighting, so Mrs Barnes plays         
 tug-of-war, ball or lets them run     
 around. There are 17 kennels for dogs 
 and 9 for cats and these are kept     
 very clean by being scrubbed out each 
 day. The animals are given the same   
 type of food that they enjoy at home.
