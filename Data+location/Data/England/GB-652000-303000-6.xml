		<content> St. Andrew's, the parish church of    
 Gorleston, dates from the 16th        
 century. Each week 400-500 people meet
 there to worship. The congregation    
 ranges from toddlers to the very      
 elderly. Church organisations meet    
 there during the week: beavers, cubs, 
 scouts, girls brigade, over 60s,      
 Ladies Club, Mother's Union, Youth    
 Club, Quest Club(7-11), instrumental  
 music club, church choir. Church      
 members and others are involved in    
 these activities. Over 100 people     
 attend bible study and prayer groups. 
 The church is a centre for voluntary  
 community work and for advice for the 
 unemployed.
