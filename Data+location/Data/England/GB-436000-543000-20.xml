		<content>{A reporter from the Peterlee Times    
{said that Haswell is small and smelly.
{I think that reporter took a          
{photograph of a place being repaired. 
{Three people I know wrote in reply.   
 Dear Sir,                             
         When I read the Peterlee Times
 I was shocked to hear you calling our 
 place a dump. I know it has it's      
 disadvantages but which place hasn't. 
 I agree it can be dull. There is      
 hardly anywhere to play but it is safe
 for young people with not many cars.  
 There are not many shops but there are
 a fish shop,V.G,a mart and a butchers 
 shop. Our village is peaceful and     
 quiet.There are lots of places to     
 walk. It has a church,chapel and a    
 small school. The disadvantage is that
 there is always paper flying about    
 after the Mart.  Yours Faithfully     
                       Donna Jenkins.  </content>
