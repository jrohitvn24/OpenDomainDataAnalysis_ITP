		<title>11Ellerton on Swale</title>
		<content>{Ellerton on Swale}is made up of the   
 hamlets of{North Ellerton}and{South   
{Ellerton.}The original farm workers'  
 cottages are now no longer occupied by
 agricultural workers,but by a few     
 ordinary families,as fewer people now 
 work on the land.                     
 The nearest shops and centre for      
 community activities is{Scorton,}a    
 village two miles to the north.The    
 nearest bus service passes through    
 Scorton.Because of the lack of a bus  
 service families have to rely on their
 own cars.                             
 The local primary school is Bolton on 
 Swale C.E.School.                     
{Ellerton Park}has a privately owned   
 lake of 60 acres stocked for coarse   
 fishing with bream,roach,carp,chub,   
 barbel,pike and eels.Fishermen can use
 the lake on a daily or seasonal basis.
