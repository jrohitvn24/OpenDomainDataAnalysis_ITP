		<title>15HOUSING  IN  ROSSINGTON</title>

        There are different types of   
 housing in and around Rossington.     
 There are houses built originally for 
 mine workers, council houses and      
 private housing.                      
     The main London to Scotland       
 railway line divides Old Rossington   
  and New Rossington. In Old           
 Rossington the houses are all private 
 homes, but in New Rossington there are
 few private homes.  There are terraces
 or semi_detached and detached types.  
     My house is one of the houses on  
 Greenlands Avenue, a private estate in
 Old Rossington.  It is a bungalow     
 built in 1970, on my road there are   
 both bungalows and houses.  They are  
 mostly three bedroomed but mine has   
 only two.  We have lived in it for ten
 years.  My house has two gardens.
