		<content> I live in an old house that was built 
 in victorian times. we have           
 fire-places in every room. The rooms  
 are very big and high--even the       
 bathroom is big.When we moved in, the 
 kitchen was very old-fashioned,so we  
 have modernised it. We have put in a  
 new door and a complete set of modern 
 furniture.                            
 My family consists of my father, my   
 mother, myself, and my younger sister.
 Every day, my father goes to work. My 
 mother looks after the house, and also
 does a part-time job. My sister and   
 I go to Blackmoor School.
