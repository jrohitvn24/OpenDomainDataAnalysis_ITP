		<title>07EDUCATION - VILLAGE SCHOOL</title>
		<content> We talked to some elderly residents   
 who live in the village about their   
 time at Napton School. They got up    
 early in the morning and had a cooked 
 breakfast and then walked to school.  
 School in the olden days was very     
 different than today. First of all the
 little children wrote in sand, then   
 they copied letters from the          
 blackboard on a slate using special   
 chalk, then a pencil and paper. When  
 they could write well, they used a pen
 dipped in ink. The desks had a lid    
 which lifted up and an inkwell. Most  
 work was copied from the blackboard,  
 they could not choose their work or   
 walk about. The teachers were very    
 strict. All the children went home for
 dinner. The elderly people showed us  
 lovely photographs of themselves in   
 pretty white dresses which they wore  
 on May 24th, Empire Day celebrations. </content>
