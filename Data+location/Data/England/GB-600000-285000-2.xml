 The{housing}stock in this area dates  
 back to the timber framing of the     
 fifteen hundreds and clay lump of the 
 eighteenth century,but there are many 
 newer ones.                           
 Houses now are{built}of brick and     
 mainly have a pantile roof,a          
 chimney,central heating and some      
 have double glazing.Almost every house
 has a bathroom and indoor{toilet.}The 
{gardens }of the older houses are      
 usually large,ranging from one third  
 to two acres;in the newer houses it is
 the custom to squash in as many houses
 as possible into one piece of land so 
 gardens are much smaller.             
 Older property in the area is much in 
 demand,and many older houses are being
 renovated.
