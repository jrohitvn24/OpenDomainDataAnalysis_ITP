		<title>17A Typical Day in Solihull.</title>
		<content> Most mornings the atmosphere is one of
 chaos in my house. Daddy, the head of 
 the family, usually cannot find his   
 keys, or a button on his shirt is     
 missing. The telephone rings and,     
 dropping the cornflakes packet, my    
 mother runs to answer it. Usually a   
 lady is ringing to ask Mummy to work  
 in one of the units for impaired      
 hearing schools. Sometimes one of     
 Daddy's friends wants a lift to work. 
 The radios in the house are blaring   
 B.R.M.B., Radio 4 or Radio 3. A loud  
 drone comes from Daddy's razor.       
 We all get dressed for school and are 
 taken over the road. At 4.10pm. I     
 arrive home from school, which is in  
 Solihull. I eat tea and then after    
 listening to the Archers on the radio 
 I have my bath and go to bed.         
                                       
                                       </content>
