		<content>   {Shire horses}originated from the   
 Great English Black Horse. Henry the  
 eighth first recognised them as an    
 individual breed in 1887.             
    The owners keep{14 Sampson shires  
 on their stud in Slinfold. The horses 
 are mainly kept for{breeding}but are  
 occasionally shown at charity         
 festivals. They are exported to       
 America or sold to the Youngs'        
 Brewery when 3 years old. Shires      
 mainly eat hay, bran and a little     
 sugar beet as they produce their own  
 heat and energy. Therefore they are   
 less expensive to keep, eating only   
 grass in Summer.                      
    In Winter they live inside and are 
 turned out in May. The owners work    
 full time with the help of a full time
 groom. The largest shire in England,  
 Lady Ann, 19 h, is kept on the stud.  
 Shires cost from{Â£2,000 to Â£10,000.   </content>
