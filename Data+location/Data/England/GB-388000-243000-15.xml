		<content>{Grazing}has been traditionally        
 important but there has been a recent 
 shift to{cereals.}Large fields        
 dominate the northern third of the    
 area. Some decidious woodland has gone
 to provide more cereal land, while    
 miles of hedges have gone as fields   
 are extended.                         
 The steeper sloped fields to the west 
 and north of{Defford}have been left as
{permanent grazing.}The high yielding  
{Friesian cow}is everywhere as the     
{"milk-cheque"}is still a vital part of
 the farmers income.                   
{Small holdings}concentrating on{deep  
{litter and battery hens}are found on  
 the edges of the main settlements as  
 are some small remnant{orchards.      
 Recent cuts in{EEC milk quotas}have   
 produced drops in dairy herd numbers. 
{Stubble burning}after the cereal      
 harvest remains a problem.            </content>
