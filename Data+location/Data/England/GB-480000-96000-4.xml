		<title>04EAST WITT. VILLAGE CENTRE</title>
		<content>   The shopping area is centred around 
 a parade of shops,of which there are a
 surprising variety considering the    
 size of the local population.They     
 maintain their viability because of   
 the village's distance from Chichester
 the nearest main shopping centre,and  
 the seasonal influx of holiday makers.
 They constitute a large proportion of 
 the yearly trade for the considerable 
 number of cafes and restaurants in the
 area.                                 
   The ancient village centre was 1    
 mile inland round the Norman Church of
 St.Mary's.However,time has seen a     
 general movement of population away   
 from this area towards the sea.The    
 "new"village shopping area was started
 in the 1920's when people bought land 
 near the foreshore because it was     
 cheap,easily accessible by road and   
 because they liked being near the sea.</content>
