		<title>18Letchmore Heath continued.</title>
		<content> During our visits we interviewed some 
 local people and were told that       
 Letchmore Heath has fallen            
 victim to some of the recent          
 spending cuts. For example there      
 is no longer a Doctor, a church, or a 
 post office in Letchmore Heath.       
 Villagers must travel to Watford or   
 Radlett. As there are only two buses  
 per week it is difficult to live there
 without a car. Because of this, and   
 the fact that there are so few local  
 facilities, very few of us said we    
 would like to live there. We felt that
 most of the people living in Letchmore
 Heath were white and middle class with
 mostly christian ideals. There is     
 however one major exception which is  
 Hare Krishna house were the men study 
 and pray .This is the main South      
 West base of the Hare Krishna Hindu   
 sect.                                 </content>
