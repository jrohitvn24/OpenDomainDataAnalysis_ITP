		<title>11The Church in Halewood.</title>
		<content>    The main religious denominations to
 be found in Halewood are the Church of
 England, the Methodists and the Roman 
 Catholic Church.                      
    St Nicholas Church of England built
 in the village of Halewood in 1839    
 still mainly serves the northern part 
 of Halewood.                          
    St Mary's Church, a joint Methodist
 Anglican venture, was built in 1967   
 and was rebuilt in 1974 following a   
 bad fire. This church tends to serve  
 the newer area of Halewood to the     
 south of the railway.                 
    There are three Catholic churches  
 within a reasonable distance but only 
 one within our area. This is St Mark's
 Church and is a reasonably new church 
 built to cater for the people living  
 in the southern part of Halewood.
