		<content> I get up at about seven o'clock in the
 morning,I have a bath and then get    
 dressed , I have my breakfast         
 at 8 o'clock, leave for school at     
 8.40 and walk about half a mile to    
 school,arriving here at 8.50.         
 First of all we read while the        
 registers are done and then we have   
 assembly.After assembly we do         
 spellings and then we do mathematics  
 for the rest of the morning with a    
 stop for playtime at 10.30. At 11.45  
 the girls lay the tables for lunch in 
 the Infants classroom.We finish lunch 
 at 12.30,play until 1.15 and then we  
 do project work for most of the       
 afternoon.After a short playtime our  
 teacher reads us a story until we put 
 on our coats.We go home at 3.30.I get 
 changed and then go out to play until 
 tea time.
