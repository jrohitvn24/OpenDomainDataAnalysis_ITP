		<content> There is a small general store in     
 Rushmere but no services in Henstead  
 so all those surveyed made regular    
 shopping excursions every week out of 
 the area. 66% of households went to   
 Lowestoft, 14% to Kessingland, 14% to 
 Beccles and 6% to Oulton Broad. 88% of
 households excluding farms supplied   
 some of their own food. Of these 61%  
 grew vegetables, 26% grew fruit &amp;13%  
 kept chickens or ducks for eggs. 88%  
 of households kept pets, cats(52%),   
 dogs(38%) and caged birds(9%). Others 
 were ducks, rabbits fish and chipmunk.
 All of the sample study group had     
 television and radio. 90% had a       
 telephone; very essential when related
 to the lack of public transport in the
 area. 80% of households had at least  
 one employed person. The other 20%    
 were retired. Only 25% of the employed
 worked in the region,in agriculture.  </content>
