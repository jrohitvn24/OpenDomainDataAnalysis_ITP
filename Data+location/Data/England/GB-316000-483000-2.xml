		<title>02ST.ANNE'S ANGLICAN CHURCH</title>
		<content> The present church was built in 1853  
 and an old church was knocked down.At 
 that time a bigger church was needed, 
 but now only about 20 people attend   
 each service.Services are every Sunday
 morning with about five special       
 services every year.23% of those asked
 claimed to attend St Anne's regularly.
 Local people clean the church         
 voluntarily.A local lady plays the    
 organ and the bell is rung by an early
 riser!There are only a few marriages, 
 christenings and funerals annually.In 
 March 1982 people started collecting  
 money for roof repairs.In January 1984
 part of the roof fell in and so work  
 had to begin.The back pews were       
 removed,part of the floor lowered,the 
 ceilings were insulated and boarded.  
 The West wall has been waterproofed   
 and the door restored.A new door,     
 sponsored by BNFL,was put on the porch</content>
