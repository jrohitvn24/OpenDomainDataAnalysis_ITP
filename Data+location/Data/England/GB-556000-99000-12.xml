		<title>12OLD TOWN, EASTBOURNE</title>
		<content> EASTBOURNE GETS ITS NAME FROM THE     
 SAXON WORD BOURNE WHICH MEANS         
 STREAM.EAST WAS ADDED IN THE 14TH     
 CENTURY.THE CENTRE OF THE TOWN WAS    
 NEAR THE PARISH CHURCH OF ST. MARY'S, 
 AT MOTCOMBE PARK WHERE THE STREAM     
 RISES.FOR MANY YEARS EASTBOURNE WAS   
 NOT A VERY IMPORTANT PLACE AND IT WAS 
 NOT UNTIL SEA BATHING BECAME POPULAR  
 AND THE RAILWAY ARRIVED IN THE 19TH   
 CENTURY DID THE TOWN BEGIN TO EXPAND. 
 THE STREETS IN OLD TOWN ARE LAID OUT  
 IN A REGULR BLOCK PATTERN. THE HOUSES 
 ARE SOLID VICTORIAN STYLES BUT NOT AS 
 GRAND AS THOSE BUILT ELSEWHERE IN THE 
 TOWN.THE HOSPITAL USED TO BE A        
 WORKHOUSE AND BEFORE THEN A CAVALRY   
 BARRACKS.NOW IT IS USED AS A          
 CONVELASCENT HOSPITAL BUT MANY OLD    
 FOLK ARE AFRAID OF IT BECAUSE OF THE  
 LINKS WITH THE POOR LAW.
