		<title>10SOCIAL SURVEY IN SLOUGH</title>
		<content>   A survey shows that people have come
 from many different parts of the world
 to live in Slough.  Nationalities     
 include:                              
                                       
{  British, Indian, Pakistani, West    
{Indian, Irish, Dutch, Hungarian,      
{Canadian, Italian, Polish.  }         
                                       
   Because the people come from so many
 places, there is a wide range of      
{Religions}(see page 11).              
   Most people live in families of 4,  
 with large families uncommon, but with
 a number of childless married couples.
 Many people have{extended families}in 
 Slough with cousins, parents, brothers
 &amp; sisters etc..                       
   People move to Slough in waves - one
 35 years ago, one 10 years ago - but  
 very few people seem to have arrived  
 in the last 10 years.                 </content>
