		<title>10Children's  Crazes.</title>
		<content>  Crazes usually do not last long e.g. 
 Skateboarding was really popular a few
 years ago but now it is rarely seen.  
  About a year ago many people became  
 interested in BMX (bicycle motor      
 cross).These are special strong cycles
 for tricks and stunts. A BMX track has
 been built on a field in Rawcliffe and
 lots of children especially boys have 
 BMX bikes.                            
   Roller boots are popular with girls 
 mostly they skate about the streets on
 them and Roller Discos were popular   
 once but not so much now              
  Another new activity is break-dancing
 There is a place in York where you can
 learn how to break-dance. Break       
 dancing means moving and spinning on  
 the floor using hands and body. Body- 
 popping is another dance craze where  
 the dancer moves like a robot.
