		<content> A considerable proportion of our D    
 block is given over to farming and,   
 from the age of many of the farm      
 houses and buildings, this has been so
 for a long time.Today intensive arable
 farming is the main agricultural land 
 use.There is also a small amount of   
 dairy farming and pig farming is also 
 important.                            
 Cereals are the main crop,especially  
 barley and winter wheat.The growing of
 oats has declined rapidly in recent   
 years.Other main crops include        
 potatoes,carrots,cabbages,Brussels    
 sprouts,cauliflowers and lettuce.     
 Lydiate is well known for strawberry  
 farms that also grow other soft fruit.
         With so many crops rotation   
 programmes are flexible but the usual 
 process is to grow potatoes once every
 7_8 years and not to have more than 3 
 cereal crops on the run.              </content>
