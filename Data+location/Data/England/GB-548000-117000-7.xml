		<title>07New Place Farm, Framfield</title>
		<content> In this area is a section of the {    
{Wealdway,}a footpath from Gravesend to
 Eastbourne, opened in September, 1981.
 Much work was needed to restore the   
 paths, putting in stiles, bridges and 
 planning a route. Today the walks are 
 used widely, particularly by the      
 Eastbourne Rambling Club. The main    
 attractions are the grounds and       
 waterfalls of New Place Farm,         
 previously known as Thurston Hall.    
 This was the centre of a mixed farming
 community which collapsed in 1952 due 
 to an outbreak of foot and mouth      
 disease. The area prospered again with
 the development of poultry houses     
 owned by Buxted Chicken Company.      
 Hemisphere International now own the  
 farm and have returned it to mixed    
 farming. The labour force includes    
 three local cowmen and two Indian boys
 hired on two year contracts.          </content>
