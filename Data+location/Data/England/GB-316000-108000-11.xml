		<content> Many people are involved in local     
 organisations e.g.Young Farmers' Club;
 Women's Institute; Keep-Fit Club;     
 School P.T.F.A.; Mother's Union;      
 and various political parties.        
 Most of the residents are keen gard-  
 eners and their efforts enhance the   
 village.  Everyone has radio and tele-
 vision which they listen and watch.   
 Several people regularly play whist,  
 skittles or darts in other villages.  
 In fact one can have quite a busy     
 social life without going very far or 
 spending a lot of money.              
 Many families use the swimming pool   
 and other facilities at Wellington    
 Sports Centre.  The boys over 8 can   
 attend the Cub Scout Pack at Hemyock. 
 For cinemas, theatres, nightclubs etc.
 villagers do have to travel to        
 Taunton, Honiton or Exeter.
