		<content>   Our Domesday Survey area lies 8     
 miles S.E. of{Shrewsbury,}the nearest 
 market town and{Shropshire's          
 administrative centre. The main A.458 
 road from{Shrewsbury to Bridgnorth}and
{Kidderminster}crosses the area. The   
 new town of{Telford}is 12 miles away  
 to the N.E.                           
   The wide and fertile valley of the  
{River Severn}occupies about half the  
 area, while the rest is land rising to
 an average level of 40m. above the    
 valley floor. Almost all the land is  
 devoted to mixed farming.             
   The village of{Cressage}(pop. about 
 680) is the main centre of population.
 It is still very much a village in    
 character, though it has expanded much
 in recent years. The village is       
 important as a centre of road         
 communications, and the whole area is 
 popular with tourists and anglers.    </content>
