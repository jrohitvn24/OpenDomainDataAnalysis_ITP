{School Continued.                     
 If I had to choose a game, it would be
 either{"Hey Presto"}or{"40 40 in."}   
 How to play{"40 40 in."               
{"40 40 in"}is like hide and seek. Some
 one closes there eyes and counts to   
 40. The rest all run and hide. When   
 you have counted to 40 you go and find
 the people who have hidden. The people
 who have hidden try to get to the     
 base, (The starting place) before the 
 person who is "on" (or "it") says "I  
 see you!" The first person to be seen 
 is "on" or "it" in the next game.     
 I like games that include lots of     
 people or if not lots then at least   
 four.
