		<content> Most children left school at 14, boys 
 went to the pit and many girls went   
 off to domestic service. Discipline   
 was stricter, parents were less       
 indulgent and society less permissive.
 Religion played a bigger role in life,
 most children went to Sunday school.  
 Pleasures were simple,TV did not      
 exsist but radio was in general use.  
 Most people visited the cinema in     
 Houghton-Children attended a Saturday 
 matinee.There was far less in the way 
 of health care,neighbours &amp; relatives 
 cared for the sick.Many diseises were 
 incurable.Motor traffic was much less 
 than now (some horses were still in   
 use),only the prosperous owned        
 personal transport.Few workers had    
 annual holidays so day trips to the   
 sea-side or bank holidays were much   
 appreciated.                          
                                       </content>
