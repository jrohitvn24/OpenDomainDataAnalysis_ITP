		<title>07HARLOW SCHOOL RENOVATIONS .</title>
		<content> Our primary school was founded by{Mr. 
{Barnard and Mr.Fawbert}in 1836.He left
 Mr.Barnard Â£8,000 in his will to do   
 what he thought was best. He decided  
 to build a school for{Old Harlow.}This
 is now being redesigned because after 
 the war with the rise in birth-rate   
 temporary "Horsa" huts had to be      
 erected.These will now be demolished  
 along with the outside toilets and the
 original building is being stripped , 
 rebuilt and extended .A new hall has  
 so far taken a year to build.         
  During this time, for the pupils, it 
 has been noisy, dirty, inconvenient,  
 and time wasting.                     
  Numbers on roll are now 158 due to   
 falling birth-rate.There are now five 
 classes, one for infants and four     
 juniors.They are all looking forward  
 to the New Look for our school .
