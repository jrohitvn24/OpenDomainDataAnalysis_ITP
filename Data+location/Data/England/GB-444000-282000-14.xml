 Mrs.Wright has lived in Monks Kirby   
 for ten years.She has also lived in   
 Birmingham and Wales the only thing   
 she misses from the other places are  
 the hills and mountains of Wales. She 
 lives in a house that is known as the 
 Alms House,which was originally four  
 houses for retired workers from the   
 Denbigh Estate.The Alms Houses were   
 in the village known as Brockhurst    
 that was seperated from the village of
 Monks Kirby by a stream and marshy    
 land.The two villages are now joined  
 by a main road which serves the school
 known as Brockhurst Middle .Brockhurst
 village itself is now known only as   
 part of Monks Kirby village.
