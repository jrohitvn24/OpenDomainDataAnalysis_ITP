		<content> The main aim of the society is to live
 a fulfilled life, to meet people and  
 take an interest in the environment by
 helping to solve problems.            
  The President's ambition is to see   
 all the problems in the village solved
 by the W.I.                           
   The main fear is that the committee 
 might break up. It holds coffee       
 mornings to raise money for charities 
 such as{Cancer Research}so the        
 charities would suffer if it did. The 
 W.I. is involved with problems varying
 from{acid rain}to uneven paving stones
 in the local streets. A play area     
 outside a local Inn has also been     
 brought before the organisation.      
 People are worried that young children
 may use this area as a regular meeting
 place,because of the possible         
 influence of alcohol.
