		<content> Following the change of the name of   
 the estate, representations were made 
 to the Governors of Boycott Farm First
 School to consider changing the name  
 of the school.  The Governors felt    
 that the parents of the school ought  
 to have an opportunity to express     
 their views so a poll was conducted   
 and the result was a clear 2:1        
 expression in favour of change.  The  
 Governors decided to recommend to the 
 Local Education Authority that the    
 name of the school be changed to      
 Westlands First School.  This         
 recommendation was accepted by the    
 Authority and the change is to come   
 into effect from 1st September, 1985.
