		<title>02THE BLACKO DOMESDAY BOX</title>
		<content> In 1985 an old toilet block at the    
 rear of{BLACKO SCHOOL}was demolished. 
 A low exterior wall was retained and  
 the area filled with soil so that a   
 garden could be created. It was       
 decided to make this into a{DOMESDAY  
{GARDEN}and, at the time of writing    
 this description, plans are still     
 being made. A large stainless steel   
 chest has been made and children at   
 school have begun to collect items    
 which will tell a future generation   
 all about life in{BLACKO}in{1985.}This
 chest will be buried in the garden and
 its position indicated by a brass     
 plaque fixed on the wall adjoining    
 Beverley Road.The box will hold
