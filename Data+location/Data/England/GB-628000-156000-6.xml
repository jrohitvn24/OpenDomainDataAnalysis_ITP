		<title>06 GROVE MANOR FARM</title>
		<content> Mr.Vincent owns the farm.He grows     
three different crops;Galahad          
wheat,which is sold for animal feed,   
blackcurrants, which are sent to Wales 
to be made into Ribena (blackcurrant   
juice) and apples.He grows mainly Coxes
but he also grows some early varieties 
to pollinate the Coxes, these are      
Discovery, Golden Delicious, George    
Cave and Worcesters. A hailstorm has   
spoilt a lot of apples this year.      
 There are 81 acres of blackcurrants   
and 2178 bushes to an acre, about      
176,000 bushes.They have to be pruned  
by hand in the winter.They are sprayed 
by a tractor and sprayer.There is a    
special harvester which bends the      
branches over to either side and shakes
the currants off onto a conveyor belt. 
Mr.Vincent employs 2 men full-time     
and  8 women part-time to help with the
work.There is a very big tithe barn.   </content>
