		<content> Housing is very scattered &amp; because of
 the Kent Structure Plan &amp; Metropolitan
 Green Belt Policies there is a        
 presumption against house building the
 exception being the conversion of     
 barns &amp; oasts &amp;, in the case of proved
 need, for a dwelling for a farm       
 worker. Consent is sometimes given for
 the extension of small cottages. There
 have been 3 cases of converting 2 or 3
 cottages, previously tenanted, into   
 gentrified houses. The majority of    
 houses are owner occupied with few    
 rented cottages. The recent policy of 
 selling council houses, and high cost 
 of housing in general in the area     
 prevents young people of modest means 
 being able to remain here.
