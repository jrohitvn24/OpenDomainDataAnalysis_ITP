		<content> There are many retirement homes in    
 Southport.There are also many nursing 
 homes and the hospitals have a lot of 
 geriatric wards. Old people come to   
 live in Southport because of the fresh
 sea air and there are plenty of things
 for pensioners to do. This area has   
 several beautiful parks, gardens and  
 other amenities.                      
 As a result of such a high proportion 
 of old people living in the area, a   
 quarter of the population, many jobs  
 have been created. The people working 
 to look after the elderly range from  
 doctors through to those who clean the
 buildings.                            
 The health authority is the largest   
 single employer in Southport.         
 This year work began on the new       
 General Hospital for the area, this   
 is because the old hospitals are out  
 of date and needed replacing.         </content>
