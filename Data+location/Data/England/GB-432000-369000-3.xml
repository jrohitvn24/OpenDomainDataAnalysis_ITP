		<title>03HOUSING - WEST CHESTERFIELD</title>
		<content>   Within the area of West Chesterfield
 there are a number of different types 
 of houses. Towards the edge of        
 Chesterfield there is a distinct      
 change in age and style. The{Brookside
 area has many old terraced houses.    
 These are mainly two storey and in    
 long rows or terraces. On the very    
 edge of the town the houses are much  
 larger and are detached. Most of these
 have at least one garage and cost     
 between Â£50 000-Â£60 000.              
   The{Loundsley Green}area was built  
 by the council to house many Londoners
 who have moved to Chesterfield in     
 recent years. Many of these houses are
 now privately owned. Some recently    
 built houses are valued at nearly Â£60 
 000. The estate is a mixture of       
 semi-detached and detached properties.
 This was to try to avoid building the 
 houses all the same.                  </content>
