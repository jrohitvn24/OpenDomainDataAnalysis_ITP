		<content> It was a dreary,wet and cold day.The  
 road was packed with buses and cars.  
 The beeping of the Pelican crossing   
 went on and off like a record.        
 Most of the people were clutching     
 umbrellas rushing to get out of the   
 rain. It probably wouldn't be as busy 
 if it wasn't a bank holiday on Monday 
 next.                                 
 Birches the local Greengrocer had     
 their large selection of fruit        
 displayed outside the shop.There      
 were Dutch tomatoes which were 68p per
 pound,Spanish strawberries at 58p per 
 punnet and Italian Golden Delicious   
 apples at 32p per pound.The local     
 theatre Romiley Forum were advertising
 many forthcoming shows. Gateways the  
 local Supermarket which sells most    
 things, was packed with people as     
 usual.
