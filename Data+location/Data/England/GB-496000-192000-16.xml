		<content>The village of Chalfont St Giles lies  
just off the main Chalfonts-Amersham   
road.Much of the old village is still  
preserved,including the church,the     
village green with its pond and the old
village pump,and many old houses.The   
river Misbourne flows beneath the vill-
age.There are over 30 shops and the    
village has been extended to include   
many new roads and housing estates,    
private and council.After some con-    
troversy,a new Medical Centre to serve 
the much increased population,has been 
built on Green Belt land behind the    
church to replace the inadequate pre-  
mises on the green.A series of lamp    
standards erected by the County Council
following a number of accidents on the 
Seer Green road are considered so ugly 
that the local Council refuses to have 
them lit.The village was the location  
of the TV series and film "Dad's Army".</content>
