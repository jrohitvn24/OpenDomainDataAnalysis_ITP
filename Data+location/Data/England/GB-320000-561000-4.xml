		<content> Recent research indicates pre-historic
 habitation. The Roman fort of MAIA,   
 A.D.122 was Hadrian's Wall's most     
 westerly garrison. It covered 7 acres 
 and housed a Milliary Cohort of       
 Auxiliaries. Bowness has commanded a  
 crossing to Galloway since ancient    
 times. During the Dark Ages,Romano-   
 Britons were subject to invasion &amp;    
 settlement by the Saxons, Danes &amp;     
 Vikings.  From A.D. 945-1157 Cumbria  
 was ruled by the Scottish Crown, hence
 its omission from the original        
 Domesday Book. After reversion to     
 English rule, Edward 1 added a        
 defensive rampart to the North face of
 the village guarding the ford. His    
 legacy was 3 centuries of Border feuds
 which continued until some 40 years   
 after the Union of the Scottish and   
 English crowns in 1603.
