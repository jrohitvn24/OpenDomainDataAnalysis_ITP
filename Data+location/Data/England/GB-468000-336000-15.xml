		<title>15CROPWELL YOUNG FARMERS</title>
		<content>{Cropwell Young Farmer's Club}has a    
 membership of approximately 50, who   
 come from a wide area &amp; many walks of 
 life. They meet weekly at the Village 
 Hall in winter &amp; arrange visits in the
 summer. They take part in inter-club  
 activities such as sporting competit- 
 ions &amp; quizzes, the Country Rally and 
 Newark Show. In 1985 they won the club
 exhibit at the Newark Show. Annually  
 they arrange a camping weekend &amp; also 
 an exchange with another club from    
 further afield. Events are held for   
 their own funds &amp; an annual sponsored 
 event for charity. This year a tractor
 was pulled from Cropwell Bishop to    
 Cropwell Butler &amp; back and raised over
 Â£340 for the Notts. Scanner appeal. At
 Christmas they go carol singing, &amp; out
 of their own funds deliver a bag of   
 potatoes to each pensioner's household
 - an event enjoyed by everyone.       </content>
