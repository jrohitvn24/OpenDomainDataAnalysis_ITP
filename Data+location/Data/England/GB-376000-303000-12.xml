		<title>12LIFE IN THE PAST 1900-1985</title>
		<content> In order to get a picture of the      
 changes which have taken place in the 
 area we interviewed a Mrs Oulton aged 
 85.She was born on the edge of the    
 area just outside the village of Ryton
 She came from a large family with 5   
 brothers and a sister.She started     
 school at the age of 4 and attended   
 the same village school in Ryton until
 she was 14.She then went to Wellington
 College.                              
  As a child she had a donkey which she
 had to look after.She also had to help
 on the farm as there was only one man 
 to help and no machinery.They kept a  
 pig which was slaughtered and its     
 manure was used as fertilizer.At that 
 time many people were employed on the 
 estate as farming was done by hand    
 using horses.All the workers lived on 
 the estate and formed a community of  
 their own.Few people live there now.  </content>
