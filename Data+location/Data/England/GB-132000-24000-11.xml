		<title>11Longships Lighthouse</title>
		<content> On a clear night as many as seven     
 lights from lighthouses and light     
 ships can be seen from the Land's End.
 Perhaps the most famous of these is   
 the Longships, seen by hundreds of    
 thousands of visitors every year.     
 The first Longships Lighthouse was    
 actually built at Sennen in 1794.Each 
 stone was carefully marked and then   
 moved out to Carn Bras,the largest of 
 the Longships reef.                   
 In 1873 the original tower was replac 
 ed by Sir James Douglass with a new   
 lighthouse increasing its strength to 
 72,000 candlepower and its clear weath
 er range to 17 miles.                 
 In 1966 the Longships became one of   
 the first British lighthouses to have 
 urgent supplies flown out by helicop  
 ter.A helipad was added in 1974 to    
 make this task easier and safer.
