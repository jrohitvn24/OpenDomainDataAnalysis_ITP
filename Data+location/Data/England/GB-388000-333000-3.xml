		<content>Alleyne's School is 427 years old.     
The Rev.Thomas Alleyne founded the     
school in 1558.The School motto is     
"Nisi Dominus Frustra" which means     
"Unless the Lord in Vain". The school  
was rebuilt in 1888 for the fourth     
time.There were additions to the       
building in 1951, 1962 and 1970.The    
Theatre can seat up to 200 people.All  
the 3rd year pupils can not fit into   
the theatre because there are only 200 
seats.The computer room can hold 30    
pupils and there are 17 computers.The  
school has a playing field, sports     
centre, squash courts, tennis courts   
and a swimming pool.The school crest   
is the same as the crest of the        
Whitehouse family and George           
Washington's family.The pupils come    
from middle schools at 13 and stay     
until they are 16 or 18.
