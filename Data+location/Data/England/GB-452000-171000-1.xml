		<content> This area of South{Berkshire}extends  
 from the{M4 motorway}in the north to  
 the River Pang in the south. It is the
 old Saxon Hundred of Faircross where  
 two{ancient trade routes}crossed-one a
 branch of the Berkshire Ridgeway to   
 Pangbourne, the other from Wallingford
 to Thatcham.There has probably been   
 life in this area for some 4,000      
 years- since the time of Abraham. It  
 is recorded in the original Domesday  
 Book. It is bordered on the west by   
 the woods of Wellhouse and on the east
 by those of High Copse. The main roads
 of the area cross at{Frilsham,}the    
 main village eight miles from Newbury 
 with no access to the M4. The minor   
 roads are winding and narrow with     
 steep banks full of ferns. The river  
 Pang runs south through the area then 
 east at Bucklebury Ford. It is a place
 of natural beauty unspoilt by change. </content>
