		<title>19Spurs Ground - Cheshunt</title>
		<content> Spurs Training Ground is near         
 Brookfield Lane.It was built 47 years 
 ago.The groundsman has been working   
 there for 35 years.                   
     The training ground is 11 acres in
 all.There are three pitches.They      
 measure 106m by 74m,111m by 74m and   
 109m by 74m.The facilities have       
 improved in recent times.They will    
 probably be moving the training ground
 to Wormley because the rates are too  
 high.                                 
     It has very few open days.The last
 one was 2 years ago.The junior team   
 plays there every Saturday in the     
 season, but the stand only holds 40   
 people.
