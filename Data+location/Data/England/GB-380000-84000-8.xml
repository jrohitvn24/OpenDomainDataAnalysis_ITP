		<title>08WELD FARMS</title>
		<content> On our map there are four farms that  
 Weld Estates let of to different      
 farmers.Some farm independently but   
 others farm together with Mr.Weld.All 
 the farms have dairy herds,these are  
 Fresians or Fresian/Holstein cows.The 
 number of cows in a herd ranges from  
 120 to 250.At the Newburgh Farm there 
 are 750 Scottish Half Breed Sheep.    
 These are a mixture of Scottish Sheep 
 and Dorset Rams.They have two lambs   
 each a year,they have proved to be    
 good mothers.                         
 The crops that the farmers grow are   
 Winter Wheat and Barley,Spring Wheat  
 and Barley;Kale;Oil_seed Rape and     
 Peas.Silage is grown for Winter feed. 
 Tourists are also important.Profits   
 from car parks and caravans are put   
 back into the Estate.Last year 150    
 large trees were planted.The tourists 
 also provide casual Summer employment.</content>
