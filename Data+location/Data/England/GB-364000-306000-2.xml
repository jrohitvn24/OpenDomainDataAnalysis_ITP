		<title>02THE OLD AND THE NEW</title>
		<content> The area exhibits a kind of split     
 personality. The former industrial    
 communities are jealous of their      
 origins. The residents of Horsehay    
 will claim it is the only 'village' in
 Telford. They will then express alarm 
 at the demise of local industry, which
 forces them to say farewell to their  
 past. In a small survey, carried out  
 in Horsehay and Doseley, it was       
 clear that many of the older folk, who
 could remember the thriving iron and  
 coal communities of the past, looked  
 upon Telford New Town as a place at   
 best to be avoided. In Little Wenlock,
 most of the old folk never went to    
 Telford town centre, because the only 
 bus of the week went to Wellington. An
 old man at New Works, where there is  
 no bus, had never been. Yet amongst   
 younger people, under 40, there was   
 almost universal praise for Telford.  </content>
