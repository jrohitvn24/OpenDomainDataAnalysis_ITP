		<title>08Home Life in the Butley Area</title>
		<content>I live in a semi-detached house with a 
kitchen, dining room, living room,     
three bedrooms and a bathroom. We have 
a shed, garage and a fairly large      
garden. We have a car and my parents   
sister and I all have bicycles. I go to
Butley Middle School and my sister goes
to school in Woodbridge. As my father i
not employed locally we have an evening
meal. Often this meal is not eaten with
all the family together. A typical meal
may consist of lasagna with no meat, as
my sister is vegetarian, peas &amp; beans. 
For pudding we have a yoghurt. My      
sister and I have a packed lunch at    
school. Our families favourite outings 
are to Pleasure Wood Hills and a       
Chinese meal in a restaurant. Our best 
holiday was when we went to Tunisia. I 
have a dog, Tess, and two hamsters. My 
mum grows house-plants and dad         
makes ships in bottles. I sing &amp; dance.</content>
