		<title>16ST MICHAELS CHURCH</title>
		<content>  The earliest history recorded, of    
 Billington Church began in 1277 with  
 the payment by the vicar of Leighton  
 to the chaplain ministering in        
 the 'chapel'.                         
  The church is in a strategic position
 on the hill where it can clearly be   
 seen, and from the churchyard there   
 are views over several counties.      
  The varying  population of Billington
 has had an effect on the church and   
 today the church does not support a   
 resident vicar. It is served by the   
 clergy from the neighbouring church of
 Leighton.                             
  Services are held on Sunday mornings 
 with an average attendance of twenty  
 people, although, after the disastrous
 fire at Leighton, evening services    
 were held at Billington and the       
 congregation from Leighton helped to  
 fill the church.                      </content>
