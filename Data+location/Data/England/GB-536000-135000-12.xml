		<title>12FARMLAND ROUND E GRINSTEAD</title>
		<content> This 12 km block to the south west of 
 East Grinstead is primarily farmland  
 with the odd patch of cultivated      
 coniferous woodland and some remaining
 areas of deciduous woods, some        
 mamaged, some not. The farms, of which
 there are about 10,are generally      
 mixed. There are roughly equal numbers
 of beef &amp; dairy cattle, often both    
 being present on the same farm. There 
 are sheep, but very few pigs. The     
 farms all have considerable amounts of
 grassland to serve these animals both 
 as cultivated pasture and as meadows  
 for hay &amp; silage. Few farms are       
 without some land devoted to crops,   
 wheat, barley &amp; oats being the most   
 common. This combination gives a      
 pleasant &amp; attractive landscape. The  
 terrain is gently undulating and      
 crossed by many streams. Fields are   
 small and bounded by hedgerows.       </content>
