 We  rented the house for thirty five  
 years and bought it ten years ago.  It
 is a very old house with heavy beams  
 and a large inglenook chimney         
 corner,with a bakers oven .  There is 
 a small slit window in the stairs     
 which looks on to the road.  The      
 stairs are stone.                     
 Drayton is much different than it was 
 when I was a child.  Then the roads   
 were rough and very muddy, but in the 
 Summer there were clouds of dust.  A  
 man in the village was employed to    
 scrape the mud from the roads in      
 the Winter.  He had a large scraper   
 which he dragged from one side to the 
 other, piling the mud at the side in  
 heaps.  When the road was mended they 
 brought big heaps of stone and put    
 them on the verges.                   </content>
