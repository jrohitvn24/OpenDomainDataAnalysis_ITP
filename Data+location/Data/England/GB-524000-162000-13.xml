		<title>13SOCIAL LIFE,CARSHALTON SRY.</title>
		<content>   Much social life these days revolves
 around the local inns. We interviewed 
 the landlord of one of the Carshalton 
 hostelries. He told us about his pub. 
   In the six years he had been there  
 he has made the two bars into one big 
 one and opened up the garden, so that 
 families can come with their children.
 They have fruit machines and one_armed
 bandits but no discos as they like to 
 keep it as a family pub and therefore 
 fairly quiet. There are 2 beer        
 deliveries every week, and spirits    
 once a fortnight.  There are about 5OO
 drinking glasses in the pub and 8     
 full_time staff and lO part_time.     
   Lager is the most popular drink in  
 summer and in the winter bitter.      
 Spirits also vary _ whisky is more    
 popular in the winter. He sells       
 somewhere between 8O or 9O different  
 drinks, and a large range of foods.   </content>
