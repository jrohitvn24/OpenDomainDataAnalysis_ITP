		<title>12DINNER AND THE SCHOOL DINER</title>
		<content> Surrey Street School children eat     
 their meals in a quite unique collect-
 ion of decaying wartime woodwork which
 began its temporary service life more 
 than forty years ago as a'communal    
 feeding centre'.By 1945 there were    
 2000 of these centres which had become
 known as 'British Restaurants'serving 
 half a million meals a day. Here as an
 adult in World War Two,and to supple- 
 ment your wartime food rations,you    
 could have bought a good two-course   
 dinner for'ninepence'(less than 4 New 
 Pence)with a choice of bacon savoury, 
 haricot mutton,vegetable pie with a   
 sauce,cabbage and potato,steam pudding
 and custard,or rice pudding.A child   
 would have paid'fourpence'(less than 2
 New Pence).The faithful old hulk will 
 be demolished soon.A classroom is to  
 be converted into a smart new kitchen 
 and we shall dine in the Hall. {N.W.  </content>
