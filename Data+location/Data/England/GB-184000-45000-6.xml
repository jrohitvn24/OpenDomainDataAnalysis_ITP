		<title>06St.Clement walk</title>
		<content>  The St. Clement walk along-side the  
 River Fal is very interesting.The     
 river is very muddy and slippery.That 
 is a disadvantage to boat owners      
 because when the tide is out it is    
 very shallow and the boats that are   
 moored there get stuck in the mud.    
   There are lots of different birds   
 that live by the river such as black  
 headed gulls, kingfishers, cormorants,
 wood pigeons, curlews and mallards.   
  It is good for fishing in the river. 
 You can catch fish such as flounder,  
 mullet,bass and the occasional sea    
 trout.                                
  In the wood land are trees such as   
 beech,oak,ash,horsechestnut, sycamore,
 blackthorn and hawthorn.If you walk   
 down the path by the river,on your    
 right is the land owned by the Duchy  
 of Cornwall.On the opposite bank is   
 part of Lord Falmouth's estate.       </content>
