		<content>      During the last 50 years many    
 changes have taken place.  In 1946 a  
 kitchen was added.  Now{Mrs O'Grady,  
 our cook, prepares about 30 lunches   
 each day and twice a week she cooks   
 for the{Meals on Wheels}service which 
 supplies food to old and housebound   
 people. The food is collected and     
 delivered by volunteers.              
      In 1978 the two main classrooms  
 were made into a hall and three class 
 areas added. The hall is now used for 
 lunch, P.E., television and assembly. 
 Indoor toilets were built. There is   
 oil central heating. We have a playing
 field but it needs better drainage.   
 There is a demountable room but as our
 numbers have fallen we are not allowed
 to heat it, so its use is limited.    
      We are quite well equipped. We   
 have a{Parent/Teacher Assoc.}which    
 raises money for equipment. (cont p5) </content>
