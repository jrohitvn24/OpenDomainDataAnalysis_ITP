		<content>  We found out that one of the         
bedrooms had two little doors through  
which you could see into the {chapel}. 
 The Buff coat which hangs on the wall 
in the {Great Hall} is made of leather 
and it was used in the Civil War.      
There were  some fire buckets which    
date back to the 18th Century. The     
buckets are made out of Leather they   
kept  water or sand in them. The       
bedrooms which they used had fires     
and the fires were lit at night so     
they kept the buckets handy just in    
case it caught on fire.                
  In the 1300 the Great Hall was the   
main living room of the house.         
 The roof would have been much higher  
and made  of timber.
