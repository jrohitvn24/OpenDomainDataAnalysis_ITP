 Carrigdene Farm has belonged to Keith 
 and Julie Strevens for 17 years. It is
 situated at the western end of the    
 Landslip and covers 5 acres of land,  
 some only a few metres from the beach.
 As well as strawberries, tomatoes,    
 lettuce, aubergines, peppers and      
 melons are grown. These crops need    
 vast quantities of water which comes  
 from a spring and is stored in a tank 
 and 120,000 gallon reservoir and      
 pumped around the farm when needed.   
 The strawberries are grown in plastic 
 tunnels, under glass and uncovered in 
 a walled garden. Casual labour is only
 employed in the summer to pick approx.
 500 lbs of strawberries a day from May
 until October. A wholesaler           
 distributes the strawberries on the   
 Island and some are sent to the       
 mainland.                             </content>
