		<title>05OUR VILLAGE AT NIGHT-POEM</title>
		<content> It's night time, and the village      
 closes it's eyes                      
 The lights go off one by one          
 And sleep has settled in.             
 The fresh smell of the countryside    
 mingles with the air.                 
 It is still and lonely.               
 Cows mooing in the night, giving a    
 last, long lonesome moo.              
 Spiky hedgehogs rustling in the       
 leaves, scuttling across the road,    
 risking their lives for food.         
 Foxes stalking their prey, stealing   
 from the farm                         
 And dogs howling through the darkness.
 The trees sway in the breeze, and     
 leaves rustle in the branches.        
 Voices echo through the night         
 Silhouettes of trees, houses and      
 hills, black against the night.       
 The moon and stars shine in the sky,  
 While children sleep in their beds.   </content>
