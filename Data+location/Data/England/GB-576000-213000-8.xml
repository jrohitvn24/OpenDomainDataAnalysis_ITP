		<title>08EMPLOYMENT IN TERLING</title>
		<content> Whereas in the old days, almost all   
 the villagers would have been employed
 on Lord Rayleigh's estate, nowadays   
 only about a third are employed there,
 either on the farms, in the Estate    
 yard, in Lord Rayleigh's Dairies or in
 the vehicle maintenance depot. The    
 farm is administered by the Office at 
 Whitelands, which employs several     
 secretarial and administrative staff. 
 The Management, most of whom are      
 members of the Strutt family, have    
 offices here. Since Terling is a      
 highly desirable village, in which to 
 live, and within easy commuting       
 distance of London, with Hatfield     
 Peveral Station only 3 miles away,    
 several new families have come here to
 live and commute. Many people work in 
 Chelmsford _ several for Marconi.Some 
 work in Witham, which is about 5 miles
 away,also in Colchester.              </content>
