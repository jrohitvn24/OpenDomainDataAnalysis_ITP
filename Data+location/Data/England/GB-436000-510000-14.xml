		<content>  The Airport was first used by the    
 R.A.F. in 1941-45. The runways,several
 metres in depth are reinforced with   
 steel and are 300 metres in length. It
 cost 10 million pounds to build a     
 runway like Teesside. The RAF chose to
 build it there because the land was   
 flat and the weather not too much of a
 hindrance as land was too far away    
 from the hills and sea to be affected 
 by fog. In 1964 it became a civil     
 airport. At Teesside Airport 24-25    
 planes land each day. Teesside Airport
 can hold any size plane,it has even   
 had a visit by Concorde. It can also  
 accomodate Boeing 747's and DC 10's.
