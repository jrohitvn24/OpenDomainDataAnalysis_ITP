		<title>20LOOKING INTO THE FUTURE.</title>
		<content>   When we try to look into the future 
 we look forward to some things and    
 worry about others _ so do our        
 parents. Some parents in 1985 have    
 become unemployed for the first time  
 in their lives and have little hope   
 of getting new jobs.Also many school  
 leavers are not able to find jobs.We  
 worry if there will be enough jobs for
 us when we leave school.              
   With all the new technology that    
 keeps being developed our future      
 should be an exciting one. We will    
 probably have more time for leisure   
 activities than our parents do.
