		<title>05SHOE INDUSTRY IN WARMINSTER</title>
		<content>  Avalon Industries is a subsidiary of 
 Clarks Shoe Company which is based in 
 Somerset. The Avalon works in         
 Warminster employs 201 people making  
 plastic and steel shoe components such
 as heel reinforcements. Works manager 
 Mr Basil Haines estimates 1985        
 production as 100 million component   
 parts. Products are delivered 4 times 
 a week as far away as Kendal, London, 
 Norfolk and Penzance. Works engineers 
 carry out all tooling and maintenance 
 for the injection moulding machines   
 and power presses worth Â£1m.          
  Part of the factory is in arched     
 "Romney Huts" built in the 1939-45 War
 to store sugar for the Ministry of    
 Food. Bought and converted by Clarks  
 after the War, the huts eventually    
 couldn't cope with increased          
 production so more modern buildings   
 were added in 1960.                   </content>
