		<title>18Mentally Handicapped Home.</title>
		<content> In March 1984 the Rev.Fieldsend,vicar 
 of Bayston Hill,applied for outline   
 planning permission on behalf of a    
 charity called Christian Concern for  
 the Mentally Handicapped.The proposed 
 site,housing up to 12 mentally        
 handicapped adults,is behind Christ   
 Church,Glebe Rd.bordering the playing 
 field and school.                     
   These proposals were outlined at a  
 meeting,in April,attended by 150      
 villagers,where strong views were     
 aired both for and against.           
   In May 1984 outline planning        
 permission was granted. It was        
 reported that a petition against the  
 proposals,signed by 242 residents,had 
 been recieved,as had 28 letters       
 against,3 with no objections,and 37 in
 favour.It was noted that,"Those who   
 supported it lived furthest away."    
  We now await more detailed proposals.</content>
