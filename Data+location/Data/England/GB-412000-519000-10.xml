		<content> The area around Staindrop is very     
 attractive with many pretty walks in  
 countryside with hedgerows &amp; woods. It
 is on the fringe of the very popular  
 Teesdale &amp; just off the main tourist  
 route. Nevertheless touists do visit  
 the area particular attractions being 
 Raby Casle, the church and the village
 itself. The centre of the village was 
 declared a conservation area in 1971. 
 This has led to improvement and       
 conservation in the village. There are
 examples of late 16th century housing 
 with rubble walls, stone slab roofs   
 and mullioned windows as well as later
 Georgian houses with colour washed    
 rough-cast stonework ans slate roofs. 
 The fan lights are particulary        
 noteable. There is evidence showing   
 where fairs and weekly markets were   
 held on the green and cobbles are     
 still below the turf in some areas.   </content>
