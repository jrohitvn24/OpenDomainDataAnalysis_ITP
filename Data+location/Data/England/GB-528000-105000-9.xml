		<content> We walked down the road to St Anne's  
 Wells Gardens. Near a clump of trees  
 there was a lady feeding squirrels    
 which were grey with light orange     
 patches on their legs. They scampered 
 round us and took food from our hands.
 Pigeons and sparrows fluttered around.
 Near by was a playground with a large 
 sandpit, a slide, four swings and a   
 climbing frame. People were on the    
 tennis courts and the bowling green or
 having coffee in a cafe. I eenjoyed   
 the Garden for the Blind most. The    
 notices were in Braille. The garden   
 was full of scented flowers and       
 bushes. We went to see the pond and   
 goldfish and some uge lily leaves.    
 Then we made our way back to school   
 listening to the birds singing and the
 leaves rustling from the many         
 different kinds of trees.
