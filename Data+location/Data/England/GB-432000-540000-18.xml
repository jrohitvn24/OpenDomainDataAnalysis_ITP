 The damp climate produces a lush grass
 cover everywhere.                     
 There are many hawthorn hedgerows.    
 We found mainly ash,elm and sycamore  
 trees in our area although we found an
 odd oak,beech and silver birch.       
 Hazel,elder and rowanberry bushes were
 quite common too.                     
 Although we found many different wild 
 flowers daisies and dandelions were   
 everywhere.                           
 Blackbirds,thrushes,magpies,rooks,star
 lings and sparrows are the most common
 birds.                                
 Other wildlife being rabbits,foxes and
 mice.                                 
 We found ladybirds,moths,butterflies, 
 beetles,snails and ants.              
 There are many paths to enable people 
 to walk through the countryside.
