		<content> The Prince Charles Container Port &amp;   
 the Freightliner Terminal have many   
 people working in them. A container is
 a way of carrying all sorts of things 
 like machinery, furniture &amp; food from 
 here to other places in our country or
 around the world.                     
{The Freightliner Terminal}: The       
 containers are brought to the terminal
 by train or ship. The trains come     
 along and stop where a crane will lift
 the container off the wagon. They put 
 it on the ground to be picked up later
 or on a wagon to be pulled away by a  
 train. They know where to put the     
 containers down because they are all  
 labelled. The crane is very large &amp; it
 moves on tracks. It picks up          
 containers &amp; has to get a perfect hit 
 because there are four holes in the   
 top of each container which it must   
 connect with.                         </content>
