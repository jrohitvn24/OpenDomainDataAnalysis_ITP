		<title>03UNEMPLOYED YOUTH</title>
		<content> I left school 3 years ago and have    
 worked for a year bricklaying and     
 decorating scheme through community   
 industry.Then for three months I was  
 on another scheme doing similiar work 
 which I enjoyed.Since then I have been
 unemployed for one year.It was boring 
 being unemployed at first but now it  
 is not so bad because most of my      
 friends are unemployed too. I usually 
 get up late,go to my friends then on  
 to the unemployment centre at         
 Brodsworth Youth Club. The money I get
 goes on beer and cigarettes.If I had  
 enough money I would buy a            
 motorbike.Sometimes I do work on the  
 side for extra cash.Eventually I hope 
 to get my Heavy Goods Vehicle licence 
 and drive lorries for a living.
