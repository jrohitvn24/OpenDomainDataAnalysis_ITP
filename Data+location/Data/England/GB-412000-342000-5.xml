		<content>The ruins of Calwich Abbey stand in the
wooded area across the river from      
Norbury.  There is a lake in front of  
them with an 18th century rotunda at   
one end.  The ground rises above       
Calwich to run in an undulating ridge, 
600 foot at its highest to Middle      
Mayfield.   At the N.W. corner of the  
area the lake drops into a deep valley 
with Dasley Wood on one side and Dydon 
on the other.                          
  From Church Mayfield the Dove loops  
its way to Norbury, its flow broken by 
three weirs.                           
  The disused railway runs along the   
valley and its two bridges over the    
river have been dismantled.  The river 
which is the county boundary marks the 
gradual change to dry stone walls for  
fencing and domestic building.
