		<title>08Pollution of the Brook</title>
		<content> There has been a poison threat to the 
 wildlife in this area.                
{"Irresponsible" farmers}have come     
 under fire from a{Vale Conservation   
{Group}after hundreds of fish were     
 killed by{river pollution}this        
 week.Investigation by{F.O.E.}and the{ 
{Water Authority}have led to a         
 poisonous herbicide known as{Dinoseb} 
 being named as the likely cause of the
 pollution. The brook was a yellow     
 green colour and as thick as pudding. 
 Dinoseb is dangerous to humans,       
 livestock and fish. The brook at      
 Cropthorne where the fish were found  
 runs from{Bredon Hill}into the{Avon.} 
 The source of the pollution has been  
 traced to a field upstream which has a
 public footpath running through it.   
 This pollution has occurred on several
 occasions, and there is now a         
 possibility of legal action.          </content>
