		<title>05WALKING DAY</title>
		<content>     The first recorded Warrington     
 Walking Day was in 1834. It was       
 started as a counter-attraction to the
 Newton Races. Walking Day is a        
 procession of witness to the Christian
 Faith. All the churches and Sunday    
 Schools of the town unite in a parade 
 through the town - led by the parish  
 church (St. Elphin's).                
 The walk is held annually on the      
 nearest Friday to the beginning of    
 July. 1985 saw the 151st. Walking Day.
 More than 6000 men, women, boys, girls
 ,clergy,bandsmen,choirs,scouts,cub    
 etc. paraded through the town.        
 Thousands more lined the streets to   
 watch. Tradition has it that new      
 clothes are worn for the walk. During 
 the walk children and adults are given
 money by friends.                     
 Unfortunately the true meaning of the 
 day now seems to be lost.             </content>
