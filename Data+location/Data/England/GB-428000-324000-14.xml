		<content> The predominant religion here is      
{Christianity,}people visiting their   
 churches on a weekly basis.           
 Church attendance is falling slightly 
 indicating a decline in the importance
 of religion or at least church-going. 
 Some of the church officials were     
 school teachers while others come from
 Repton village, the dominant village  
 of the parish.                        
 Every other week, services are held at
 St.Marys in Newton Solney or at the   
 church at Bretby.                     
{ St. Marys}is approximately 285       
 years old and is Anglo-Catholic. The  
 vicar there believes that there has   
 been a slight increase in the interest
 shown by parishoners in the church and
 its various activities.
