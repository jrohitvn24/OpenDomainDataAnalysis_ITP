		<title>03TRADE IN MIDHURST</title>
		<content> Midhurst is a thriving centre with a  
 wide range of shops catering for the  
 needs of inhabitants and holiday      
 visitors.Local needs are well served  
 by small local businesses and 3 chain 
 stores.In recent years new shop       
 accommodation has been available in   
 single units and in indoor            
 markets.Many new shops,which are      
 mainly very specialist,have survived  
 only a few months suggesting that     
 there is insufficient custom to       
 support more shops.A monthly market   
 functions at the Grange Centre.A wide 
 variety of stall-holders come,many    
 from outside the area, selling mainly 
 fancy goods and bric-a-brac.Local     
 people and visitors complain that     
 goods,especially fresh food,are very  
 expensive compared with nearby towns  
 and it is difficult to buy cheap      
 clothes for teenagers locally.        </content>
