		<content> My family became tenants of the{smithy
 in 1919. In 1920 we started selling   
{petrol}from cans; installed petrol    
 pumps in 1924; we started{repairing   
{cars,}recharging wireless batteries,  
 welding, maintaining milking machine  
 engines, and general engineering in   
 the following years. We had a{horse   
{and waggonette,}and later{motorcars   
{(taxis) for hire.}When the farmers got
{tractors}we converted horse drawn     
 equipment for towing by tractors, and 
 when{electricity}became available, we 
 converted{milking machine}engines to  
 do other tasks, such as driving       
 elevators. For thirty years we        
 conveyed{children}to vairous{schools  
 from many areas. In 1971 we sold our  
 business and the smithy became a{cafe,
 the shoeing house became the kitchen, 
 the cowshed became toilets, and the   
 orchard a{car park.                   </content>
