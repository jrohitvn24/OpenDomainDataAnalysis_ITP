		<content>   The original church was opposite the
 Manor House, where  the old churchyard
 is  now. There  was a  shrine  to  St.
{Rumbold }and an altar to St Catherine,
 patron saint of lacemakers.The present
 Church was  built  in  1780  on Church
 Hill after the spire of the old Church
 had fallen down twice.                
   In 1865  the  chancel and porch were
 added. Some  interesting things to see
 in the church are:                    
 A{stall}from the old church.          
 An old Latin School{desk}made in 1626.
 A brass{chandelier}given by Browne    
 Willis M.P. in 1705.                  
 Latin{Bible}given by Archdeacon John  
 Rudying in 1471.                      
 A copy of the{transfiguration}by

 will be hung at the West End up in the
 gallery.
