		<title>08Blandford - Playground Game</title>
		<content> In the playground we play Eggs,Bacon, 
 Chips &amp; Cheese. There is a person'ON  
 IT'and that person asks the other     
 people to put out their hands &amp; she   
 taps their hands &amp; says{'Eggs,Bacon,  
{Chips &amp; Cheese which would you rather 
{please for your supper tonight'.}The  
 person whose hand she taps on'tonight'
 chooses eggs or bacon &amp; so on. If she 
 chooses chips she gets swung fast,    
 bacon is slower,eggs slower still &amp;   
 cheese is the slowest.After you've    
 been swung you stay in the shape you  
 land.When everyone has had a swing the
 person ON IT tells each one what they 
 look like-gorilla,ballerina,gymnast,  
 sunbather.Then she says{Clockworks    
{begin}&amp; they have to act what they    
 look like.Then she says{Clockworks go 
{to sleep}&amp; everyone lies down &amp; she   
 wakes up all but one. Everyone shakes 
 that person.That person is On It.CARLY</content>
