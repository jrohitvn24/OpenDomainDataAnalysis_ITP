		<title>14Grove Farm,Great Kimble</title>
		<content>We were shown around the farm by       
MR.M.R Willis the farm manger for      
MR.J.W Robarts who owns the farm.The   
date was 2\7\85.There are 683 acres    
under cultivation .The crops are Winter
Barley and Winter Wheat.The soil is too
wet and too heavy in the spring for the
seeds to germinate.Winter Wheat        
varieties are Avalone,Mission(for      
milling )and  Norman ,Gallahad (for    
feeding). Winter barley variety is     
Igri (for feed). Permanent grass       
is for feeding the Store Cattle and a  
suckling herd of 54 animals.The breed  
of suckling herd is Simmental. There   
are cows,2 bulls and male &amp; female     
calves. The store cattle are Charolais 
which are bought in at 500 kg, fattened
until they weigh 850kg and are then    
sold. Because of the heavy land the    
animals are kept in sheds during winter
and fed with Hay and Silage.           </content>
