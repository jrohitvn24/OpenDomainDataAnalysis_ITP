		<title>12Mill at Thornton</title>
		<content> The mill, owned by the Burgess family 
 since 1920, has 65 employees, and     
 stands on the same site as the mill   
 mentioned in the original Domesday    
 Book.It covers an area of 5 acres and 
 the owners have progressively         
 modernised the building rather than   
 re-build it.                          
{Changes.}In 1900 it was a water mill  
 powered by water from the beck. In    
 1915 it was modernised, and in 1948   
 converted to electrical power. Since  
 1963 it has stopped milling flour and 
 has changed to the production of      
 animal feeds.                         
{Sales.}Animal feed for cows, pigs,    
 sheep, rabbits, dogs and calves is    
 transported all over Yorkshire and    
 Durham. About 80% is sold in bulk,    
 and 20% in bags. Each bag weighs      
 approximately 25 kilograms.
