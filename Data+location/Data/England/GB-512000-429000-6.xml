		<title>06COMMUNITY POLICEMAN, HULL</title>
		<content> Police Constable Scruton is the{      
{Community Police Officer}for most of  
 East Hull. He has the largest patch in
 the City. He is responsible for the   
 policing in most of our block.        
 He is a local man, his father being   
 deputy headmaster of one of the local 
 schools.                              
 Because he is well known in the area  
 he is often approached by people      
 offering information about "jobs" who 
 are unwilling to talk to other police 
 officers.                             
 Much of his time is spent talking to  
 and dealing with young people. For    
 example, he has organanised several of
 the visits undertaken during the      
 course of this project. He hopes that 
 by getting to know the citizens when  
 they are young, perhaps under his     
 watchful eye he can keep them out of  
 trouble. He is well liked in the area.</content>
