  1981 saw the celebrations of George  
 Stephenson's bicentenary. There was a 
 display of locomotives on the Jubilee 
 Field including the 'Puffing Billy'   
 one of Stephenson's locomotives. A    
 fancy dress parade was included and   
 many stalls, tents and displays were  
 held. Â£2800 was raised and the money  
 was distributed among various village 
 groups. {                             
{150TH anniversary of the              
{Blaydon-Hexham line }                 
  In March 1985 the last steam train to
 be built, Evening Star, travelled     
 along the line to mark the 150th      
 anniversary of the Blaydon-Hexham line
 and it is hoped that more celebrations
 will take place in the local villages 
 to mark the 150th anniversary of the  
 Newcastle-Carlisle line in 1989.
