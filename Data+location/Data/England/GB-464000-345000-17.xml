		<title>17TRAVELLING TO WORK.A SURVEY.</title>
		<content>  I interviewed 5 people I know in     
 Lowdham to find out how they get to   
 work.                                 
  1) A teacher at a local comprehensive
 school.                               
    He gets a lift in a car from a     
 friend.                               
  2)An office worker for Boots in      
 Nottingham.                           
    She has a car and drives to work.  
  3)A prison officer at Lowdham Grange.
    She lives on the adjacent estate   
 and usually walks but occasionally    
 drives.                               
  4)An accountant in Nottingham.       
    He has a car and drives to work.   
  5)A local publican.                  
    He lives on the premises so he has 
 no need to travel at all.             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
