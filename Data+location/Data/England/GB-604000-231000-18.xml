 Constable's mill is no longer there.  
 Clover's mill ceased trading last year
 and is being converted into 37 flats. 
 There has been a lot of local argument
 about this,because of the new         
 resident's cars and traffic problems, 
 but if it was a mill there would be a 
 lot of heavy lorries.Our old school   
 was knocked down last year.It had been
 empty for over 10 years.The Duchy of  
 Lancaster sold the school to the      
 Samuel Barker Trust and now there are 
 three almshouses for old people on the
 site.                                 
    Soon there will be a speed limit in
 this village which will be good and a 
 car park which is badly needed.
