		<title>03Yaxham Primary School</title>
		<content> The school was built in the middle    
 of the last century to serve the      
 parish of Yaxham.  As a Church of     
 England Primary School it has proudly 
 maintained its links with the local   
 church.  Today the school has a roll  
 of around 50 pupils and 3 teaching    
 staff. The old building               
 with its "Gothic" windows hides the   
 fact that inside there is a modern    
 and well                              
 equipped  school. The school field is 
 used for a wide variety of activities.
 Parents and friends are closely       
 involved with the life of the school; 
 providing Fund Raising support and    
 attending events such as Sports,      
 Harvest and Christmas festivals,      
 Plays, a Christmas Fayre,and Dances.  
 At the age of eleven the majority of  
 the children go to the local High     
 School in East Dereham.               </content>
