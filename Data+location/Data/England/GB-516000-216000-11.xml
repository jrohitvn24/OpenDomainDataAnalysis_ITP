		<title>11A Day in My Life.</title>
		<content>  This morning,Thursday 20th June 1985,
  I woke up at 8-o'clock,got dressed   
 and had breakfast(a bowl of Shredded  
 Wheat).Then I packed my school bag and
 walked to school.I waited in the play_
 ground until the whistle went and     
 then walked into the classroom.Our    
 teacher called the register while we  
 read a book.Then we went to the hall  
 for assembly. Our lessons were Maths, 
 English and Topic.We prepared for     
 Sports Day.I won the high jump with a 
 jump of 1.11m.School finished at 3.15 
 but I stayed behind for gym club.When 
 I got home I went for a bike ride     
 until 6-o'clock when I returned home  
 for dinner(shepherds pie and peas).   
 Then I helped my mum tidy up,watched  
 television and went to bed at         
 9_o'clock.
