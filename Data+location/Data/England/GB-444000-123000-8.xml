		<content> In former times, there were many sheep
 reared on the farms in Compton and the
 surrounding area. Dr. Robinson's house
 is on the path of one of the old drove
 roads which ran from Compton Street up
 to the Downs. So when the Robinson    
 family moved into the house 13 years  
 ago, they changed the name fro "The   
 Cottage" to "Drove Cottage". Some of  
 the beams in the cottage date from    
 around 1500. They are not sure where  
 the beams came from, possibly ships'  
 timbers or even the church. Apprentice
 marks can be clearly seen on some of  
 the beams. This sugests that the      
 timber was cut especially for the     
 house. Originally, Drove Cottage had a
 thatched roof. The Robinson's had the 
 thatch removed and replaced by old    
 tiles.
