		<title>14THE GHOST OF ASHTON COURT</title>
		<content> The ghost of{ASHTON COURT}is a woman  
 called {ANN SMYTH}who was stabbed when
 she was young.Now she is supposed to  
 walk across the veranda with the knife
 in her heart.There are many stories   
 told of this but there are other      
 stories such as a woman with all of   
 the animals in the graves begging  for
 the knife.I looked at a book that has 
 a man that was supposed to see it.This
 man told of a mail coach and four     
 horses with a coach driver.Nobody     
 knows the truth.Really the mystery    
 still remains.
