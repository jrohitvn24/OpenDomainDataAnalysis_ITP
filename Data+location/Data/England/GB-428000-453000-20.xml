		<content> The housing behind the Leeds Road     
 shops is mostly old terraced,dating   
 back to Victorian times. The inhab-   
 itants enjoy living there. There are  
 also dislikes: one of them is         
 Hookstone Road with all its heavy     
 traffic;the people also dislike parked
 cars on the pavements.Most of the     
 people have lived there all their     
 lives or else lived in nearby streets 
 because they like the area.On the     
 other side of Hookstone Road the      
 houses are detatched,semi-detatched or
 bungalows and are more modern.Most    
 people use the Leeds Road shops rather
 than going to town.Many of the houses 
 were built around 1940.The houses on  
 Coronation Grove,Coronation Avenue and
 Coronation Road were built in 1900.At 
 the end of Coronation Grove there is a
 carpet warehouse which used to be a   
 cotton mill.                          </content>
