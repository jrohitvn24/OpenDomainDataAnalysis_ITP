		<title>12Weekly shopping in Streetly</title>
		<content> My mum goes to Kwik Save on Chester   
 Road when she goes shopping. She also 
 goes to Kelly's Supermarket in        
 Boundary Court. It is the shop nearest
 Hundred Acre Road. Paul and I found   
 out that in our class most people went
 to Kwik Save. 14 out of 29 go there.  
 The 2nd most popular was 4 for the new
 Fine Fare in Queslett Road. 1 goes to 
 Carrefour at Minworth and 1 goes to   
 Marks and Spencers. Paul's mum goes to
 Fine Fare the most. She goes there in 
 a mini 850 and my mum goes in her     
 Volkswagen Golf car. Most people go to
 a supermarket once a week.
