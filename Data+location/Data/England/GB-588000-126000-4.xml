		<content>  Mr. Frith moved to this farm in 1970 
 and he has mostly modern buildings    
 with one long, old building.  He has  
 about 511 acres 160 of these being    
 reclaimed marshland which makes very  
 good soil for growing crops.  He has 6
 tractors, 3 trailers and 2 fertilizer 
 spreaders. His 3 daughters have a calf
 each.  There is a{Chitting Shed}which 
 Mr. Frith uses for chitting; the      
 seed potatoes are kept in here in     
 trays, (the chits are the shoots on   
 the sprouting potatoes).              
  Mrs. Frith keeps 150 Kent_Sussex     
 cross ewes and 1 Suffolk and 3 Dorset 
 rams.  She has 203 lambs this year.   
 Mr. Frith has a barn in the shape of a
 referee's whistle in which he keeps   
 hay and when the ewes are in lamb they
 go in the whistle shed.               
  Mr. Frith grows cereal crops, oil    
 seed rape and potatoes.               </content>
