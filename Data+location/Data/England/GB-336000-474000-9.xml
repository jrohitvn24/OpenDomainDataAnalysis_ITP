		<title>09The Timber Yard</title>
		<content>   If you drive through Allithwaite you
 cannot miss{Knipe's woodyard,}in the  
 centre of the village.                
   Here you will find skilled craftsmen
 making parts for houses and specialist
 items. Mr.Knipe and his men have made 
 many items for local churches, such as
 new doors for Cartmel Priory,an altar,
 tables, font cover and doors for the  
 church in Allithwaite.The largest item
 made was a waterwheel.                
   The yard has its own 'tradesmans'   
 mark which is carved onto a finished  
 piece.The mark is a small snail.      
   Although timber comes from local    
 forests,much is imported from Russia, 
 Brazil.Sweden,Africa and Canada.      
   The business has been handed down in
 the family and Mr.Knipe hopes that his
 son will continue the tradition.
