		<content>   If you drive through Wylye          
 Village,turn left into Teapot Lane and
 right towards Dinton,you will find    
 yourself climbing the south slope of  
 the Wylye Valley,making for the       
 beech woods of Dinton Hill.           
    We went in May and beneath the     
 trees was a carpet of bluebells.      
    We stood very still under a huge   
 old beech,its vast bole carved with   
 initials of the past.As we looked up, 
 its new green leaves made a patterned 
 umbrella against the sky.Beneath our  
 feet were soft, moist, layers of dark 
 leaf mold and filberts.               
    As we listened in that soft sea of 
 bluebells,we could hear the distant   
 sounds of farm life;cows,sheep and    
 tractors beyond the closer prattle of 
 bird song.
