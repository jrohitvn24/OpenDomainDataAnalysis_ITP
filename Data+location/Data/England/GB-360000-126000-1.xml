		<content> The land area around us is dominated  
 by farmland.Our area is fairly quiet  
 apart from where the A303 runs through
 from Sparkford to Wincanton.The A303  
 is especially busy in the summer with 
 holiday makers.                       
   The area we are studying is made up 
 of mainly grass lands with copses and 
 small woods dotted around.There are 3 
 churches and aproximatly 30 footpaths 
 .The roofs of houses are made of      
 different materials tiles, slates and 
 thatch.The older houses are built     
 mainly of local stone.From the church 
 tower we could see quite a lot        
 although it was misty. We could see   
 Compton Castle which is south east    
 from the church tower.There are eight 
 dairy farms in our block.
