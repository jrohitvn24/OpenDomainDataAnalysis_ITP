		<content> About half the homes are farms or have
 farming connections, so life revolves 
 around this industry.  Wives and      
 children help with poultry, calves,   
 pigs, fruit, home decorating,         
 maintenance, and accounts.  Housework 
 is easier with electric cleaners,     
 washing machines, refrigerators, food 
 mixers, and cookers. Telephones,      
 television, cars and bikes are common-
 place. Many homes have fitted kitchens
 also bathrooms, solid fuel heaters and
 cookers, good country furniture and   
 carpets. Most homes have pets, dogs   
 and cats. Gardens are well stocked    
 with flowers and vegetables.Children  
 attend school out of the area and so  
 go by bus after a breakfast of cereals
 and tea, having lunch or sandwiches   
 there and returning for a cooked meal.
 Homework is usual, many children have 
 music or dancing lessons.             </content>
