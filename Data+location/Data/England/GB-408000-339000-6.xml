    The company which started by       
producing farm trailers,moved into a   
small cheese factory in Rocester in    
1952.The factory today covers          
1,250,000 sq.ft.The earth around had   
to be excavated to a depth of 40ft.The 
lower part of the building is made of  
concrete or brick,the upper  part of   
corragated sheet metal painted green   
to match in with the countryside.There 
is a helicopter landing pad where      
prospective customers are brought from 
the nearest airport to view and        
inspect the products.It overlooks      
beautiful landscaped grounds and 3     
lakes which are used by employees for  
recreation.
