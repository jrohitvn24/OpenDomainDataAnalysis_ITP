		<title>20   Modern Bayham Abbey</title>
		<content>    In the 1870's a magnificent{mansion
 was built on the south facing slopes, 
 overlooking the monastery ruins.      
 Confusingly, it was also named{Bayham 
{Abbey.}The outbuildings to the rear   
 included its own fire station, but the
 appliance was only called out once and
 the fire was out before it arrived. At
 this present time the mansion has been
 converted into several private flats  
 and the outbuildings into extremely   
 attractive cottages. The views across 
 the lake to the ruins are idyllic.    
   The{River Teise}flows into the 16   
 acres of{Bayham Lake.}A series of     
 waterfalls and pools have enhanced the
 natural attraction for{fly fishermen.}
 The{trout}to be caught from boats or  
 the bank average over a kilogram.
