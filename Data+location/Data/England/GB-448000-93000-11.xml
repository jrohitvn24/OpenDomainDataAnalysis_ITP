		<content>    Here are some of the rooms that we 
 saw:                                  
  {                                    
{  The Durbar Room                     
    This room is big and on the ground 
 floor.  It is filed with objects from 
 India.  The furniture is made of      
 mahogany.  There are lovely carvings, 
 in Plaster of Paris, on the walls.    
 But the ceiling really caught my eye, 
 because the carvings were so delicate 
 and it must have taken months to      
 complete.                             
                                       
  {The Billiard Room                   
    This is a very grand room.  The    
 actual billiard table's legs are made 
 out of ivory and the cloth is green   
 velvet and two chandeliers used to    
 hang over the billiard table in       
 Victoria's day, but now electric      
 lights hang in their place.           </content>
