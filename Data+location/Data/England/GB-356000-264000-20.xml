		<content>{Roads.}Area has one 'A' road the A4112
 running through it, transversed by    
 numerous 'B' roads, one of which is   
 still gated.All these roads are       
 maintained by Hereford and Worcester  
 County Council.                       
{Private Transport.}Very few families  
 are without a car as Public Transport 
 is almost nonexistant. In 1985 a      
{Community Wheels Scheme }was started  
 to assist people without transport to 
 make essential journeys.              
{Bus Service,}On Tuesdays and Fridays  
 a Service runs between Leominster and 
 Tenbury Wells along the A4112. During 
 the summer months a service from      
 Birmingham to Aberystwyth and return  
 also travels along this route on      
 certain days.                         
{Railway.}The nearest Station is at    
 Leominster.
