		<content> This unlikely coincidence is found in 
 one of the blocks along with a number 
 of shops and houses and one school.   
 In 1985 the farm buildings of Manor   
 Farm ,built 99 years ago were         
 demolished and new houses are now     
 being built on the site.              
 The West Leicester golf course is used
 widely and overlaps onto part of this 
 area.                                 
 There is still some farmland for      
 grazing and the sewage works,which are
 well away from the residential part of
 the land,is quite modern.These works  
 serve most of West Leicester.         
 Until the war,Glenfield village was   
 seperate from Leicester but is now    
 linked to the city by the spread of   
 New Parks Council Estate.
