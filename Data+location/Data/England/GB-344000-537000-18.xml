		<title>18HUTTON MARR SCHOOL CLOSURE</title>
		<content> This school is closing on the 17th of 
 July, 1985.  Despite efforts of       
 parents, governors and members of the 
 community, assisted by others who had 
 conducted similar campaigns, even to  
 the extent of Hutton's sending a      
 delegation to Westminster to put our  
 case to the Secretary of State, the   
 decision to close the school was      
 announced this spring.                
                                       
 Reasons given are economical - that in
 order to comply with government       
 restrictions on expenditure, the      
 L.E.A. must take out of operation a   
 certain number of unused school       
 places; and educational - that schools
 of Hutton Marr's size do not provide  
 sufficient opportunities for their    
 children.    {Time will tell as to    
{whether or not the decision was the   
{best one in all respects.}            </content>
