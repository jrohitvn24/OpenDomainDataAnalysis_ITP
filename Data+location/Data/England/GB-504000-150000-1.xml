		<content> East and West Clandon are villages    
 surrounded in the main by open land.  
 They each have a Stately home, both   
 built in 18th centurey, and the churhc
 in each village has some remaining    
 features from the 13th century.       
 Thereare many houses dating from 18th 
 c. East Clndon remains an unchanged   
 country village and its residents are 
 largely upper middle class business   
 people. A railway station has been    
 built at West Clandon encouraging     
 ribbon development of houses for      
 commuters. This has changed the       
 character of the village. few people  
 work locally and 70% of the residents 
 own cars. The villages conduct        
 separate lives but combine for the    
 Seniors Club run by the red Cross and 
 flourishing Horticultural Society.    
 There is the British Legion Social    
 club for those eligible to join.      </content>
