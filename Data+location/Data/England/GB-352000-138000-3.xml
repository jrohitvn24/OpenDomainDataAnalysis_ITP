		<title>03THE VILLAGE OF WEST PENNARD</title>
		<content>    West Pennard is a T-shaped village 
 with houses on either side of the main
 Glastonbury to Shepton Mallet road and
 a smaller road branching off to the   
 south. The village is primarily a     
 farming village. Once there were many 
 small farms; now there are just a few 
 large ones. Modern residential        
 development has been limited to "in-  
 filling" between older properties and 
 many local stone cottages and farm    
 houses still exist. There is one small
 development of a dozen council houses 
 to the south of the village. Important
 buildings include the church, school  
 and village hall. This was given to   
 the village over 50 years ago and is  
 now run by a committee and is self-   
 financing. The post office is also the
 general store. On the main road there 
 are garages and petrol stations and a 
 public house with a skittle alley.    </content>
