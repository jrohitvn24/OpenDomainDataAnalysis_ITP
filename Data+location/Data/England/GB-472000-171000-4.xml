		<content>   New Town Primary School has been    
 burgled twice this year and it has    
 been very difficult for some classes  
 in our school to carry on with their  
 work. A video and a computer have been
 stolen. They nearly broke into the    
 safe and took the money in it but     
 luckily they were caught.             
   Last year some one was raped in     
 Filey Road.  She was in her thirties  
 and she was on her own when she was   
 attacked.                             
   Last year there was a fire in Amity 
 Street. The house was mostly burnt    
 down but the remains were knocked down
 then cleared away. It was the home of 
 a boy from our shool called Tanveer.He
 is a third year junior.               
   Around this area there is a lot of  
 vandalism especially around Cholmeley 
 Place on the garages and walls. It    
 should be banned from Britain.J.Hannah</content>
