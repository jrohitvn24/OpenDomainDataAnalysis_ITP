		<title>05WOODLANDS VILLAGE</title>
		<content>{ Woodlands}is a large village situated
 on the Great North Road some 4 miles  
 north-west of Doncaster.Original area 
 was wooded parkland owned by          
 Brodsworth Estate.Village built to    
 provide homes for miners at Brodsworth
 colliery in 1907 and was designed by  
 Percy Houston of Chesterfield as model
 village based on "Garden City         
 Principle".Was first model village and
 has been regarded as example of       
 excellent town planning. Visited by   
 King George V and Queen Mary in 1912. 
 Increased need for housing has meant  
 falling standards in village.Now      
 village is badly designed. Majority of
 village still serves colliery but     
 smaller industries provide work for   
 residents who number 4576.It is close 
 knit community with many activities   
 based on Miner's Welfare(1923) and    
 local Leisure Centre(l972).           </content>
