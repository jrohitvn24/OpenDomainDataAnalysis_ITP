		<content> One of the many features of this area 
 that a casual observer would not      
 notice is the ponds which are tucked  
 away in odd wooded corners between    
 fields and are only visible for a     
 short distance. In one grid square    
 there are 27 ponds which cover an area
 of over l00 square metres, giving a   
 total of over 800 square metres, a    
 sizeable area for such a detail of the
 landscape. These silent places are    
 haunted by moorhens and overhung by   
 the blackish-green foliage of the oak.
 Clumps of flags and willows line the  
 water and are mirrored in its placid  
 surface. Only odd shafts of sunlight  
 penetrate to the surface pondweed     
 crossed by bird tracks. One or two    
 ponds are are at the roadside and even
 they are often hidden away  in        
 intimate and private beauty.
