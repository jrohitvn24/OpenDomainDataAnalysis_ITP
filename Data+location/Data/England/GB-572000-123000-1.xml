         Brief History                 
 In the Domesday Book of 1086 this area
 is known as "The Hundred of Henhert". 
  The original settlement was a village
 called Drigsell which was positioned  
 about 3/4 mile to the east of the     
 present village of Robertsbridge.     
  A Cistercian Abbey was built and the 
 village was depopulated with the      
 villagers being moved to a smaller    
 settlement called Salehurst.Most were 
 moved to a crossing point on the River
 Rother and the settlement of          
 Rothersbridge was born.               
  Salehurst is really two Anglo-Saxon  
 words:-SEALTH meaning Willow and HURST
 meaning a Thick Wood.The parish has   
 been known as Salehurst since the 14th
 Century.
