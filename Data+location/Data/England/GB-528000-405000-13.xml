		<title>13    RAILWAY OR ROAD ?</title>
		<content>   The{Grimsby Louth Railway}ran its   
 last special trains in 1980 and in    
 1982 the track was taken up.The       
 preservation society will not be able 
 to run their trains right into Grimsby
 because a new road will carry traffic 
 into Grimsby from the south.This new  
 road scheme is called the{Peaks       
{Parkway}scheme. This new road scheme  
 is being organised by Humberside      
 County Council.If the new road is not 
 built it is the wish of the           
 preservation society to open the line 
 right into Grimsby.                   
   Only time will tell whether the road
 or the railway will be built but both 
 schemes will be useful to the local   
 area. The new road will divert lots of
 heavy traffic away from the villages  
 of{New Waltham and Scartho.}The       
 railway will bring back direct travel 
 to the many small local villages.     </content>
