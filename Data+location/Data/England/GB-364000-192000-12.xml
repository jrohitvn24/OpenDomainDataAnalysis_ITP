		<content>attending to Parochial Church Council  
meetings.  He did not think a visit by 
us would be rewarding, but he did give 
further information on events in       
Rockhampton.                           
  They held a pancake race-in snow and 
ice-on the Cricket field on Shrove     
Tuesday, and this now seemed to have   
become a tradition - or possibly a     
revival of an older one.  They also    
took part in a celebration of 40 years 
of peace on May 8th in commemoration of
VE Day 1945.  This was well supported  
by young and old.                      
  They held a Confirmation service on  
Mothering Sunday, l7th March, the first
one held there in the past seven years.
They also hold a family service once a 
month which is attended by parents and 
children and this has become a growing 
point of the Church.
