		<title>19Houses Thornley Knowle Green</title>
		<content> This area is Green Belt which means   
 that planning permision for new houses
 is seldom obtainable.   The only plans
 accepted are for the conversion of    
 existing disused barns etc. to houses,
 and there are many examples of this   
 type of development.   The widely     
 scattered farm houses and cottages are
 mainly built of local stone with slate
 roofs.   Where the land of small farms
 has been put to larger units, the old 
 farmhouse has often been enlarged by  
 the addition of extra rooms,  some    
 converted from adjoining barns.   In  
 other cases, disused agricultural     
 buildings have been tuirned into      
 cottages keeping their original       
 floor-area and essential features such
 as large barn-doors and slate roofs.
