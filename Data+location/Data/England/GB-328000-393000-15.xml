		<title>15THE QUARRY</title>
		<content> The site of the quarry is on the      
 corner of Rowson St. and Mt. Pleasant 
 Rd. The quarry was dug on land known  
 as Little Brighton Common, and today  
 the pub opposite is called the Little 
 Brighton, but locals call it the      
 Ginny.                                
 The quarry began in 1889 and stone    
 from it was used locally for walls and
 in St. Hilary's Church. A lady who has
 lived nearby for 70 years told us that
 many Welsh people worked at the quarry
 and lived near it. In 1912 the quarry 
 closed. Alderman James Smith gave the 
 land to Wallasey. It became a park and
 the stone entrance tells about this.  
 In the centre of the park was a       
 Chinese Pavilion, but it burned down. 
 Today the park has 2 bowling greens   
 and a playground. The park has a      
 mens' toilet, but no ladies. (2aM     
 1985).                                </content>
