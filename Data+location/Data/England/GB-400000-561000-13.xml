		<content>          A Typical Saturday.          
 My mum and dad get up first at five   
 o'clock to tend to the animals and see
 if any sheep have lambed. Then        
 Jaqueline and I get up at seven       
 o'clock. Mum cooks the breakfast then 
 I go and put the goats out.I help dad 
 muck out and feed the bullocks and put
 Buttercup the cow out.                
 I get Laddie the dog out and go round 
 the stock in a Land Rover, while Mum  
 and Jaqueline make the lunch. We have 
 chips and hamburgers.                 
 Then mum goes to the shop to buy the  
 milk bread and our comics. Jaqueline  
 and I wash the dishes. Then I play on 
 my own or I watch televison.          
 I help mum make the tea which is      
 sandwiches scones and ginger bread.   
 After tea I ride my bike. When I come 
 back I have my bath then I watch      
 television and then I go to bed.      </content>
