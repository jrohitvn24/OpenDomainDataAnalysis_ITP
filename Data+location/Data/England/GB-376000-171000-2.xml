		<title>02FARMING IN MARSHFIELD</title>
		<content> The area is mainly grassland with     
 stone walls, hedges and some woodland.
 The terrain has south facing valleys  
 and is on the edge of the Cotswold    
 brash.  The land is chiefly grazed by 
 cattle to fatten for meat.  Some sheep
 are kept but the flocks average under 
 a hundred rather than more.  Dipping  
 has been compulsory during summer and 
 autumn to check sheep-scab.  No case  
 has been reported in Marshfield.  The 
 arable land grows winter crops of     
 wheat, barley and oats; also spring   
 sown crops.  A small acreage is taken 
 by potatoes and swedes.  Oilseed rape 
 was grown this year.  The farms are   
 owner-occupied in this block, apart   
 from seventy acres or so.  The farms  
 are generally run by the families     
 concerned, very little outside labour 
 being employed.  (Continued)
