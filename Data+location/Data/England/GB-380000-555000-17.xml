		<content>  In no time at all it is{1300         
{hours.}Time to go downstairs and      
 re_open the shop and Post Office.My   
 wife rushes off to the hairdressers.I 
 am on my own _ No my mother is here to
 help while I continue with the Post   
 Office accounts and serve another rush
 of customers who,by some amazing sense
 of timing appear from nowhere just as 
 I open the door!                      
  It is about 15.35 Martin has just    
 arrived home from school and as usual 
 he goes straight to the sweet         
 counter.He gets a playful clip around 
 the ear as he pushes past me into the 
 house.Who is he bringing home today _ 
 Stephen,Robert,Peter?                 
{ 1600 hours}My Post Office accounts   
 are complete;I breathe a sigh of      
 relief.they have balanced first time  
 so no checking over the figures a     
 second time.                          </content>
