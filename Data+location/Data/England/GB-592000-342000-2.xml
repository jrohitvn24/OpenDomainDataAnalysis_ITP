		<content> The area consists of undulating low   
hills about 30 metres ASL with rounded 
valleys mouled by ice and melt water   
but with very little surface water     
today.                                 
Offshore and along the northern margin 
of the marsh huge areas of sand are    
uncovered by the low tides.Material is 
brought by tidal currents from the sea 
bed and by longshore drift from ice age
deposits which make up the cliffs 20   
kms to the east.                       
The salt and fresh water marshes which 
lie between the sands and the old shore
are the natural development of the     
coast or mans' efforts,with drains and 
embankments,to improve the salt marsh  
for agricultural use.                  
The chalk bedrock is covered with mixed
glacial sands that benefitted from the 
benefitted from the soil improvement   
techniques developed by Thomas Coke.   </content>
