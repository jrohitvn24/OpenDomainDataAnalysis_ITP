		<title>07EMPLOYMENT AROUND RAMSBOTTOM</title>
		<content> The pattern of{employment}in the      
 smaller towns around Ramsbottom is    
 very different to that in Ramsbottom  
 itself. People who live in Hawkshaw,  
 Greenmount, Holcombe Brook and        
 Summerseat tend not to work in these  
 towns themselves. They are mainly     
{commuters,}working in Manchester,     
 Bolton and Bury. The area has a good  
 transport network e.g. the M.66, and  
 this facilitates easy movement within 
 the area. These smaller settlements   
 around Ramsbottom experience a large  
{outflow}of traffic in the morning     
 between 8 and 9, and an{inflow}between
 4 and 6. Most of the workers are      
{service workers,}many with firms cars.
 There are very few employment         
 opportunities within the towns        
 themselves but they do not suffer an  
{unemployment}problem.
