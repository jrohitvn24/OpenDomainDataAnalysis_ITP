{ROAD SURVEY}                          
Everyone agreed that even though the   
local roads were too narrow they very  
pleasant.The majority felt that if     
new Industry was introduced it would   
spoil the rural atmosphere.They all    
agreed that improvements could be made 
to the social community:-more social   
activities, more clubs for young and   
old.                                   
{THE YOUNGER GENERATION}               
  There are quite a few children under 
the age of 16 in the area.  Although   
most of those interviewed felt that    
there was little to do after school    
hours, none of them found themselves   
watching television out of boredom.
