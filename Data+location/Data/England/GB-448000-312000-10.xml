		<title>10Tourism in Charnwood</title>
		<content> Only a small proportion of the        
 thousands of visitors to this area are
 tourists (i.e.whose journeys have not 
 originated from home) and even these  
 tend to be staying with friends or    
 realtives.Tourist accommodation is    
 represented by a Youth Hostel of 22   
 beds at Copt Oak which also takes a   
 few caravans &amp; a touring caravan site 
 with no sanitation at Bawdon Castle   
 Farm near the B591.There are no       
 restaurants or cafes.Day visitors     
 account for over 90% and the numbers  
 rise to a peak on fine sunny Sunday   
 afternoons in summertimes but continue
 at a high level all round the year.   
 Many are taking a leisure drive       
 through the attractive countryside,   
 other activities are visiting Beacon  
 Hill,following footpaths,picnicking &amp; 
 nature study.The proximity of the M1  
 extends the catchment zone.           </content>
