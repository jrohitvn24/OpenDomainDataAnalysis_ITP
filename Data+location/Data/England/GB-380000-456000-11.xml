		<title>11THE HOSPITAL IN LONGPRESTON</title>
		<content>  The Hospital,later referred to as"The
 Almshouses" and now known as Knowles  
 Cottages,was built in accordance with 
 the will of James Knowles made in     
 1613 and Letters Patent by James 1    
 in 1616.There were ten cottages for   
 the poor of the ecclesiastical parish 
 with a Chapel in the centre which the 
 beneficiaries attended twice daily.   
  The complex was entirely rebuilt in  
 1859 and about 1902 an office and     
 treatment room for the District Nurse 
 was added.This was later converted    
 into a dwelling.There were outside    
 toilets at each end of the block and a
 communal wash-house.                  
  The buildings were condemned by the  
 District Council in 1960.
