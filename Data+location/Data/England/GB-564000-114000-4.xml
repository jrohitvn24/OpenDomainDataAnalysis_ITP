 This is a popular area for the keeping
 and riding of horses. There is a large
 proportion of grazing land as well as 
 relatively quiet roads and several    
 bridleways. Many horses and ponies are
 owned privately and used purely for   
 pleasure.  The majority are kept on   
 their owner's farms or small acreage. 
 At several larger stables, racehorses 
 and point-to-point horses are trained 
 taking advantage of the undulating    
 country lanes to get horses fit. A    
 riding school offers lessons,hacking  
 and livery and Haflinger &amp; highland   
 ponies are bred there.  Another stud  
 farm breeds larger riding horses and  
 many other mares are kept for         
 breeding, some of them thoroughbred.  
 There is a farrier based in the area  
 working on locally owned horses.
