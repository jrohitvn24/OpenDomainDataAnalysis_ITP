		<title>02Crop Farming:Great Bromley</title>
		<content>   This is the primary type of farming 
 in this area.The average{farm size}is 
{200 hectares.}Most farmers are        
 renting part of their land.           
   The{main crops}grown are cereal     
 crops,such as{barley &amp; wheat,}root    
 crops such as{potatoes &amp; sugarbeet,   
{&amp;beans.}The farmers rely on spraying  
 crops with{artificial fungicides &amp;    
{fertilizers}to improve &amp; maintain     
 their yields.In the past cattle were  
 kept,but today only a few arable      
 farmers keep{pigs or fatten turkeys.  
   Horsedrawn ploughs have been        
 replaced by{machinery,e.g. combine    
{harvesters.}Small fields have been    
 amalgamated to make the machinery     
 easier to use.{Farm buildings}are now 
 made from{asbestos &amp; steel.}These     
 replaced brick &amp; tile buildings which 
 were expensive to build &amp; difficult to
 maintain.                             </content>
