		<content> Mr.Terry Viney (Editor of the Romsey  
 Avertiser) was born in 1933 and thinks
 his family may originally have been   
 French. He was educated in Romsey     
 until he won a scholarship to Barton  
 Peveril School in Eastleigh. Mr. Viney
 has lived in Romsey all his life and  
 worked for the Advertiser since 1952. 
 The first paper in Romsey was called  
 'The Romsey Register'. It started in  
 1854 and continued until 1894. The    
 'Romsey South Hants Chronicle' started
 in 1876 and finished in 1887. The     
 'Romsey Standard' started in 1883 and 
 finished in 1884.The Romsey Advertiser
 was a branch of the Andover Advertiser
 Before the Second World War the Romsey
 Advertiser produced 10 pages in each  
 paper and long and detailed reports   
 but this was reduced to 4 pages during
 the war. In the 60's papers were      
 enlarged and were more eye catching.  </content>
