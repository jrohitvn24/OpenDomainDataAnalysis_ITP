		<title>18YEW TREE FARM VISIT</title>
		<content> This farm keeps sheep and grows       
barley,wheat,and hay(for winter        
feeding).The sheep are dipped twice a  
year to prevent sheep scab.They stay   
immersed for a minute,a ministry       
official has to attend this event.Two  
or three go in at a time.The sheep walk
through a tray containing special      
chemicals to harden their feet and to  
stop their feet rotting.A sheep with   
triplets has one of them taken away and
put with another ewe with a            
singleton.The ewes head is restrained  
between bars and the young lamb will   
begin to smell like the ewe as it      
feeds.The sheep produce meat and       
wool.The wheat,the primary grain,is    
used for flour and animal feed.The     
barley is used for whiskey,malt vinegar
and animal feed.
