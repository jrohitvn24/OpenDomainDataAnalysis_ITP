		<content> On the{River Thames}there are many    
 kinds of boats, such as motor         
 cruisers, speed boats, rowing and     
 sailing boats.  There are also        
 pleasure boats that take people to    
{Hampton Court, Windsor}and{Richmond,} 
 two of these are paddle steamers.     
 Schools use the river to learn to row 
 or sail on.  There are two ferry      
 stations where people can cross to{   
{Hampton Court Park.} On the Kingston  
 side there are some gardens, called{  
{Queens Promenade}and on the Hampton   
 Court side there are four private     
 houses.  The wildlife to be found on  
 the river are fish, ducks, Canadian   
 Geese and some swans.  People feed the
 pigeons and other wildlife while they 
 sit on benches in the sun.
