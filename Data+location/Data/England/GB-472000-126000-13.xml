		<title>13HIGHER OAKSHOTT FARM</title>
		<content>{Oakshott}is a hamlet nestling in the  
 folds of the hangers half way between 
 Steep Marsh &amp; Hawkley.Higher Oakshott 
 Farm,situated at the north end of the 
 hamlet,once had a 50 acre hop garden. 
 17 yrs ago they took up dairy farming,
 with a herd of 120 cows.Now the family
 breed horses-the trend towards Horsi- 
 -culture being prevalent in the area  
 at present.The mother of one of their 
 foals won last year's Huntworld Cup at
 Hawley,Surrey.The barn at Higher      
 Oakshott farm is nearly 300 years old 
 and has been burnt down twice.Oakshott
 village isn't really a village at all.
 It consists of a row of farms which   
 straddle  the road. First comes Lower 
 Oakshott Farm.Just to the north comes 
 Middle Oakshott Farm.Further to the   
 north,still,comes Higher Oakshott Farm
 situated on high ground.They still dry
 hops in the 4 storey barn there.      </content>
