		<content>    The{tracks}or{tramways}as they were
 called, were used to{carry heavy      
{trucks}pulled by{horses}or{men}from   
 the{mine}to the nearest{canal}or      
{river.} The early{railway}tracks were 
 made of{wood.}These tracks weren't    
 really{efficient.}                    
    Men had been{experimenting}with    
{steam engines}and railway track.      
 Within 25 years the land was          
 criss-crossed with nearly{seven       
{thousand miles of working railways.   
{Stephenson's}famous{Liverpool}to      
{Manchester}line opened in{1830.} The  
 old Victorian tracks which are near   
 Navigation Gardens have been removed  
 and have been put away by the side.   
 These tracks are all{tatty}and{rusty.}
 Near the railway tracks is a{coal}    
 mine. Railway tracks have{increased}  
 throughout the area. {Little boys,}of 
{8 or 9 years}used to work on railways.</content>
