		<title>08THE PORT OF GOOLE</title>
		<content>   Goole is Britain's most inland port 
 - some 50 miles from the North Sea.   
  In April 1985, Associated British    
 Ports announced that the Humber Ports 
 made a{profit}of Â£7.7million with     
 Goole "performing very well".It       
 reported that there was more business 
 in '84 than '83. Both{steel}exports   
 and{grain}imports were higher. The    
 opening of the{container}terminal in  
 January '84 had more than doubled     
 traffic. Unfortunately, the national  
 docks and miner's{strikes}both        
 affected the port in 1984.            
  This year, Associated British Ports  
 announced that the dock's{police}force
 which had existed for 120 years was to
 be discontinued. This caused concern  
 that the docks would be less secure,  
{smuggling}would increase and the risk 
 of{rabies}entering the country would  
 be greater.                           </content>
