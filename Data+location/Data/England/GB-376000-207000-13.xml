 The idea of British Bulldog is for two
 lines of people to run at each other  
 and get past without anyone getting   
 tagged by the person standing between 
 the two lines. If anyone gets tagged  
 then they become IT for the next      
 round.                                
                                       
 These games show a high level of      
 ingenuity on the part of local school 
 children but are noticeable for their 
 lack of derivation from other modern  
 means of entertainment such as the    
 television. Children in this rural    
 area still prefer to use their        
 imagination rather than rely on       
 external forms of fun.
