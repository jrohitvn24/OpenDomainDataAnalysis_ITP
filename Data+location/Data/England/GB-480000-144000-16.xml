 In the police station there are always

 We interviewed P.C.Tidy, the community
 policeman for the Wrecclesham area. He
 said the main problems were petty     
 crime and vandalism.Accused persons   
 are tried at Farnham Magistrates      
 courts; More serious cases go to the  
 crown court. As community policeman   
 P.C.Tidy spends a lot of his time     
 visiting schools in this area.
