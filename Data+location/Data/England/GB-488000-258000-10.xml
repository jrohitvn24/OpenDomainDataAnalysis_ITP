BRANNON AND MRS. EMBLETON WHO THOUGHT  
THAT NEW PEOPLE COMING INTO THE VILLAGE
NEEDED INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT WAS      
GOING ON. THE FIRST EDITION WAS ISSUED 
IN MARCH 1980 AND HAD 12 PAGES.THE     
MAGAZINE HAS BEEN PUBLISHED EVERY THREE
MONTHS SINCE THEN.IT IS DISTRIBUTED    
FREE TO EVERY HOUSE IN BOZEAT.EVERY    
CLUB IN THE VILLAGE CAN PUT THEIR NEWS 
IN.THERE IS A VILLAGE DIARY AS WELL SO 
EVERYBODY KNOWS WHATS GOING ON.MONEY   
IS RAISED BY ADVERTISING,BUT THE       
ADVERTISER MUST HAVE A BOZEAT          
CONNECTION.A RECENT EDITION WAS USED   
TO DISCUSS THE PROPOSED NEW BY-PASS.   
NEWCOMERS ARE WELCOMED AS ARE BIRTHS   
AND MARRIAGES.OLD HISTORICAL           
DOCUMENTS ARE INCLUDED,THE VILLAGE     
POLICEMAN WRITES,AND LOCAL RECIPES ARE 
INCLUDED.                              </content>
