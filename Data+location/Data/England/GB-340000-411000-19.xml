		<title>19Burscough-Present-Problems</title>
		<content>Amongst current local issues are       
concern over a proposed Burscough      
by-pass road,pressures on farming,and  
local unemployment.                    
Work is due to start in 1987 on        
building a by-pass through the study   
area.In October 1985 Mrs Chalker the   
Transport Secretary visited the local  
industrial estate.Based here are a     
number of local firms such as:-Firwood 
timber supplies,Haulage Contracters,   
Hill's motor car body sales,Hudson's   
tractor repairs.She told the local     
newspaper that although the estate had 
brought some distress it has also      
brought much needed jobs."What would be
an ideal solution would be a direct    
accessfrom the industrial estate to the
by-pass".Local farmers challenge that a
by-pass for Burscough is neccessary at 
all.
