		<title>08Businesses in Southwick</title>
		<content> The village is served by a{General    
{Store cum Post Office}that sells      
 groceries, confectionery, tobacco and 
 alcohol. Southwick is graced by two   
 public houses, the Red Lion which is  
 owned by Gales Ales and the Golden    
 Lion - a free house and{a brewery.}The
 brewing has only restarted in the last
 couple of months and was featured in  
 the regional news on television. The  
 brewery closed in l957 when the master
 brewer{'Old Dick Olding'}retired. The 
 brewery was sold to Courage but fell  
 into disuse, now however it is a      
 working museum, viewed by appointment.
 It is financed partly by the County, a
 brewery and MSC and is run by         
 volunteers.
