		<content>    Public footpaths criss-cross the   
 downland and provide many splendid    
 country walks. The most used and      
 well-known path is the South Downs Way
 which runs along the top of the Downs 
 from Eastbourne to Winchester, 90     
 miles away.                           
    As all the downland is owned by the
 Corporation, there is growing public  
 pressure that it should be used for   
 recreation. Perhaps in 30 years time  
 there will be no more farming in this 
 area and the public will have all     
 their land back.                      
    There are 2 golf-courses in the    
 area: 'the Royal Eastbourne' and 'the 
 Downs'. Both are well-used and an     
 attraction for visitors to the area.  
    Recently hang-gliding has become   
 very popular and the Downs provide an 
 ideal situation for the gliders, when 
 the wind blows from the sea.          </content>
