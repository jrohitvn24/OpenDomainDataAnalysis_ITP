		<title>02WHY PEOPLE LIVE HERE.</title>
		<content>  Why do people live in this area?When 
 we asked this question people replied 
 that their work was close,they liked  
 the countryside,it was close to a town
 or that they had been born here.      
  They enjoyed the countryside for its 
 peace and quiet,the fresh air,the     
 hills and lovely scenery. They liked  
 the natural life surrounding the      
 village,the friendly people and the   
 good communications within easy       
 reach.Their dislikes were the poor    
 public transport,the lack of          
 facilities such as                    
 shops,doctors,dentists,libraries and  
 little for young people to do.Some    
 people disliked the crop spraying in  
 the vicinity, the traffic,new         
 buildings,the horses on the road and  
 the expense of travel.
