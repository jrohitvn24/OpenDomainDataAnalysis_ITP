		<content> In 1985 people in this area have      
 equipped their houses with many       
 gadgets to make life easier. They     
 have cooking aids like                
 mixers,liqidisers, electric carving   
 knives, chippers and tin openers.     
 There are tumble dryers and washing   
 machines, electric and rotary irons to
 smooth clothes. We have vacuum        
 cleaners to suck up dust to help with 
 housework. Ladies have hair driers,   
 rollers and tongs to curl their hair! 
 There are electric toothbrushes and   
 shavers that you find in the bathroom.
 Many people tend to do do-it-yourself 
 jobs around the home to improve their 
 houses. Tools used include power      
 drills and screw drivers, power saws, 
 grinding wheels and sanders. Many     
 households have a number of tools for 
 home improvements. These are kept in  
 the garage or workshop.               </content>
