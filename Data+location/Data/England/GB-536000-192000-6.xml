		<title>06TRANSPORT IN CHINGFORD</title>
		<content>  The railway runs to Chingford from   
 Liverpool St.A long time ago there    
 were steam engines but now there are  
 electric trains.This station was      
 opened in 1878,but this wasn't the    
 original station.The line was going to
 High Beach(in Epping Forest)but was   
 never finished.Chingford grew when the
 railway arrived and it is very busy   
 with people going to London to work.  
 People used to come out  of London on 
 the train to go to Epping Forest.     
   There are alot of sidings for       
 commuter trains but no goods trains.  
 Next to the railway station is the bus
 station which is also a terminus.     
  The buses which go from this terminus
 are;-97 to Leyton.97a to Hackney.212
