		<content> One of the major{employers}in         
 Dovercourt{industry}is Portals        
 engineering.We were able to pay them a
 visit and to have the chance to       
 discover just what it is they do      
 there.                                
  Mr. Good, the manager of the factory 
 answered our questions. He told us    
 that the company made  large number of
 machines which are able to{print      
{labels}for a whole range of products, 
 and then to take the bottles, tins, or
 whatever,and to stick the labels on.It
 was amazing to see the many different 
 types that they have,and also         
 interesting to notice how many of the 
 labels have{bar codes}put on          
 them.These will be read by other      
 machines to keep a check on stock and 
 prices.It seems strange to think that 
 machines made here are{exported}to 52 
 different countries around the world. </content>
