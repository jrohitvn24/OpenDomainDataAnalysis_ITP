		<content> Syerston is a small{cul-de-sac village
 half a mile from the Fosse Way. It    
 consists of a road leading from the   
 Fosse which splits into two village   
 streets, both of which eventually     
 become footpaths through fields.      
 The area surrounding the village is   
 gently undulating and now mostly      
 devoted to arable farming. There are  
 many attractive trees and fine hedges 
 which line the village streets and    
 approaches. This, combined with wide  
 grass verges makes Syerston a pleasant
 rural village. Buildings are a mixture
 of old and new red brick with pantile 
 roofs prevail. There are cottages     
 dating from C17th. and four listed    
 buildings. There are recent           
 conversions from redundant buildings, 
 modern houses and bungalows and a     
 crescent of ex-RAF houses. There is a 
 C13th Church, village hall and P.O.   </content>
