		<title>15Three Owls Bird Sanctuary</title>
		<content> The Three Owls Bird Sanctuary in      
 Norden was founded in 1963 by a lady  
 called Mrs. Watkinson. She looked     
 after injured birds and soon got a    
 reputation around Norden and Rochdale.
 Since then it has grown and now there 
 are more than 600 birds there. The aim
 is to return birds to the wild when   
 they are well but many of them choose 
 to stay. The sanctuary runs on        
 donations and voluntary help. Young   
 people have helped to build ponds for 
 water birds. There are owls, kestrels,
 gulls, gannets and lots of other      
 birds.                                
    Recently two of the herons nested. 
 The female laid five eggs and two of  
 them hatched out. The chicks were     
 lovely and grew very quickly. It is   
 very unusual for this to happen, so   
 the birds must be very happy there.
