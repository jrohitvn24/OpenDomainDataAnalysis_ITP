		<title>18LOCAL HISTORY:FENNY COMPTON.</title>
		<content> The village was called "Contone" in   
 the Domesday Survey,getting its       
 present name in the reign of Henry    
 3rd.The village lay off the highroads 
 &amp; remained isolated &amp; remote until the
 digging of the Oxford Canal in 1776,  
 folowed by the London to Birmingham   
 railway in 1852,both giving links to  
 the outer community.In 1779, at the   
 time of the Enclosure Award, there    
 were 35 small landowners,reduced to 8 
 by 1841, the census year which shows  
 the rural nature of the grid area.Then
 there were 61 farmworkers,8 joiners,  
 5 tailors,4 graziers,4 blacksmiths,3  
 butchers,2 sawyers,1 miller,3 carriers
 2 shoemakers,1 bonesetter,1 Rector,a  
 policeman,&amp; a Schoolmaster.Today,the  
 community is of some 6 farmers,with   
 highly mechanised farms,while many    
 people commute to work by car in local
 towns.There are many old,&amp; few young. </content>
