		<title>18THE OLDEST RESIDENT</title>
		<content> Mr. &amp; Mrs.Kent are two of the oldest  
 residents of the village.They were    
 born in the village and have lived    
 here all their lives.They both went to
 the village school but had to leave at
 the age of thirteen.Mrs.Kent had to go
 and work on a farm and Mr.Kent went to
 work at a bakers and earned 2/6d (12p)
 per week.All of this money was given  
 to his parents,and he might be lucky  
 to be given one old penny for him to  
 spend himself.Both boys and girls went
 to school in petticoats.There was no  
 transport in the village ,unless you  
 were rich and could afford a horse and
 trap.There were no food shops either  
 and to get any you had to walk into   
 Rugeley,a distance of seven miles.
