		<title>05My Home in Purley</title>
		<content>   My house is quite large, I have a   
 bedroom to myself with a television   
 and a computer in it. My bed has a    
 duvet on it. My brother and sister    
 also have separate rooms.             
   I usually do my homework in my      
 bedroom or in the study. We have four 
 televisions and a video recorder.     
 Three televisions are colour and one  
 is black and white.                   
   We usually eat in the kitchen but on
 special occasions we eat in the dining
 room. We also have a garage.          
   My house was built in 1926 and has  
 an air raid shelter that was used in  
 the Second World War.                 
   In my garden we have a fish pond and
 a concrete patio. One side of the back
 garden is lined with conifer trees,   
 the other by wooden fences.           
   The front garden has a path leading 
 to the road.                          </content>
