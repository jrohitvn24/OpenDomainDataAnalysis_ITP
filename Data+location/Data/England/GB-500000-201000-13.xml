		<title>13CAR JUMP RECORD</title>
		<content>      Tony Lawrence from Abbots Langley
 made a bid to break the world record  
 by car jumping. He wanted to beat the 
 old record that covered 232 feet, held
 by an American, Jackie Decreed. He    
 wanted to cover a distance more than  
 235 feet. He was going to jump with   
 his car, Captain Havoc, which was a   
 Jaguar XJ12. After 5 pm on Monday 26th
 August 1985 he made a leap and landed 
 in the row of cars. An ambulance      
 rushed to the scene but he was not    
 hurt. Afterwards he took himself to   
 the hospital with nothing but a couple
 of bruises. Jackie Decreed herself was
 watching.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
