		<title>12THE LANCASTER CANAL-HISTORY.</title>
		<content>                                       
 The Lancaster Canal originally went   
from Preston to Kendal, passing through
the city of Lancaster. Plans to build  
the canal were formed in 1792 for three
reasons. Firstly,transporting coal from
South Lancashire northwards, secondly, 
bringing produce from the farmlands to 
the coal field and finally as a boost  
to the trade of Lancaster.             
 The building of the canal was         
organised by John Rennie,but much of it
was carried out by William Cartwright. 
Building it was a big job, all the bed 
was lined with clay, there were bridges
and aqueducts to build,and some,but not
many locks. All the work was done by   
hand, there were no mechanical tools.  
 Commercial traffic on the canal ceased
in 1947 and since then about 10 miles  
at the north end have been abandoned.  
This caused much controversy in 1965.  </content>
