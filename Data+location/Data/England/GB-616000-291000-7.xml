		<title>07SAINT MARY'S CHURCH</title>
		<content> The church is notable, with its Norman
 tower and its mediaeval sexton's wheel
 fixed to the wall - a rare relic. A   
 more recent acquisition is the White  
 Altar Frontal (given to the church in 
 1972) the design of which incorporates
 representations of Long Stratton High 
 School and the Health Centre,         
 symbolising education and physical    
 care in the village.                  
 The oldest tomestone in the graveyard 
 was dated 1815.                       
                                       
                                       
 In loving memory of Elizabeth the wife
 of John Howes Jnr. who died November  
 13th. 1815 aged 38 years.
