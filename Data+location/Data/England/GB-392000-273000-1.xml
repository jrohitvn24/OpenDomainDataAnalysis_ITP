		<title>01Pepper Wood, Fairfield</title>
		<content> 30 children from Fairfield First      
 School visited Pepper Wood. We had a  
 guide called Andrew Thompson. The size
 of Pepper Wood is 134 acres. The wood 
 grows on a clay soil which makes the  
 bridle way very muddy. There are 36   
 different types of trees. This means  
 it is very ancient woodland which     
 started to grow 10000 years ago at the
 end of the last ice age. The main     
 trees are oak and birch. Other trees  
 include ash, hazel, rowan, aspen,     
 hawthorn and sycamore. Also there are 
 12 wild sevic trees and 6 small leaved
 limes which only grow in ancient      
 woodland. The flowers which grow in   
 there are bluebells, milkwort, gorse, 
 wild rose, vetch, willow herb,        
 stitchwort, bilberry, buttercup,      
 yellow arch angel, goose grass, fow   
 glove. Also we saw bracken and moss.  
 There are lots of insects &amp; animals.  </content>
