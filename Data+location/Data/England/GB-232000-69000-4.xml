 around some of the estates. There is a
 choosing of the{Carnival Queen}before 
 the Carnival and they represent       
 Callington at other Carnivals. Most   
 years there has been a fair after the 
 Carnival but sometimes the fair comes 
 another day.                          
    The Carnival takes place in the    
 month of July. Most of the{floats}are 
 decorated with crepe paper and tissue 
 etc.                                  
    Also at the end of the Carnival    
 they have the{Kit Hill Run}to Kit Hill

 who comes in first.
