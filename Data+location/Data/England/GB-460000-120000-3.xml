		<content> The A32 road runs north/south(Reading 
 to Gosport)by the villages. Most of   
 the traffic on this road is light     
 vehicles, although some heavy lorries 
 use this route from the coast to the  
 M.3 and thence to London.             
 The B.3035 goes west to Bishop's      
 Waltham and carries mostly local      
 traffic from the villages to shops,   
 banks and schools in Bishop's Waltham.
 All the area is covered by            
 Telecommunication. There are 5 post   
 boxes in the area,each having 2       
 collections per day. There are also 2 
 postal deliveries per day.            
                                       
                                       
 The beacon on Beacon Hill has been lit
 in recent times such as on Queen      
 Elizabeth II's Silver Jubilee.
