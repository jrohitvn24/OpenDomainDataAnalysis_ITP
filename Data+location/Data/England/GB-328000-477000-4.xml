		<title>04Ulverston Canal</title>
		<content>   The first sod of the canal was cut  
 in September 1793 by Colonel Sunder-  
 land and it was{opened in 1796.}The   
 canal brought prosperity to the town  
 with a population of 3,000. Trade with
 the rest of England increased.Between 
 1798 and 1848,over 13,000 ships used  
 the canal;this was over 1.1 million   
 tonnes of shipping. When it was built,
 it was the shortest,straightest canal 
 in England being only{1.5 miles long. 
 Its importance declined after 1857    
 when a railway line was laid.         
   The canal is now owned by Glaxochem 
 plc. who use it as cooling water.Ulv- 
 erston Anglers have fishing rights to 
 the canal and it is used for the      
 annual Charter celebrations. The canal
 has recently been renovated at a cost 
 of Â£26,000 spent to stop the banks    
 collapsing and on clearing litter in  
 and around the canal.                 </content>
