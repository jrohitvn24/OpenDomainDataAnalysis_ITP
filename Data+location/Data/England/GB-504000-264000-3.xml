		<title>03Wildlife in Swineshead</title>
		<content> Every Spring many frogs become road   
 casualties in their yearly migration  
 to the ponds around Moat Farm and     
 Sandy Lane area. As time passes the   
 ponds become full of tadpoles.        
 As you approach Swineshead from any   
 direction you become aware of the     
 amount of trees in and around the     
 village. These are mainly deciduous   
 and consist of elm, ash and oak.      
 Although in recent years Dutch Elm    
 disease has taken a toll of the elm   
 population. However, tree planting    
 will help make up the losses.         
 Swineshead is quite fortunate in the  
 amount and variety of bird life due to
 its position and varied types of      
 cover. The birds quite commonly seen  
 around Swineshead include;            
 woodpeckers, blackcaps, whitethroats, 
 numerous warblers, flycatchers, owls, 
 gamebirds plus the commoner species.  </content>
