		<content> If we wanted to go to the theatre we  
 would have to go by private transport,
 the nearest places being York,        
 Harrogate,Leeds and Richmond.It would 
 be the same if we wanted to see a film
 because Ripon cinema has now closed   
 down.                                 
    There is no Leisure Centre near us 
 either but we can go swimming at Ripon
 Spa Baths.If we want to play badminton
 or squash, roller skating or ice      
 skating we have to go as far as       
 Billingham which is in Cleveland.     
    There is a bowling green, a golf   
 course, a rugby club and a race course
 in Ripon.But if we wanted to watch a  
 football match we would have to go to 
 York.                                 
    We can play football and cricket in
 North Stainley.
