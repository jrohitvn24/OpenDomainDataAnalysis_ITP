		<content>   It is very quiet living here        
 especially away from the main road.   
 There have been several crashes on the
 sharp bends and some people think     
 there should be a by-pass.            
   Having a{Village Hall}is a great    
 advantage and many people use its     
 facilities.  The{Church}and the{Chapel
 also help to foster a community       
 spirit.                               
   People spend a lot of time looking  
 after their homes and gardens and     
 their children often help.            
   Some people visit one of the two    
 village pubs in the evening or stay in
 to watch television. Occasionally they
 will go to Market Rasen, Lincoln,     
 Grimsby or Gainsborough to use        
 facilities there. Most people find it 
 necessary to have their own transport.
