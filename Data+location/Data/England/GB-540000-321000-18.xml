		<title>18    THE RAILWAYS cont.</title>
		<content>    This lasted until 1926 when it     
 became the L.M.S. &amp; L.N.E. joint      
 controlled from Lynn. The M.&amp;G.N.J.   
 was known by locals as the 'Muddle and
 Get Nowhere Railway'. It was          
 nationalised in 1948 and closed to    
 passengers in 1959. The line continued
 to operate until 1965 as a goods line 
 hauled by diesel locomotives. Some    
 buildings still remain and odd        
 sections of line including the        
 turntable. Toll houses remain as      
 private houses. A second bridge was   
 built when the line was extended. It  
 had to cope with heavy locomotives,   
 operated by hydraulic power. Tolls    
 were charged until 1903. My great     
 great grandad, Harry Crowson started  
 as a lamp boy at 13 and became the    
 longest serving railwayman for        
 M.&amp;G.N.J. Railway. He served for 52   
 years.                                </content>
