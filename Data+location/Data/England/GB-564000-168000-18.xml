		<content>{Mr.Jackson}is the chairman of the     
 Parish Council.He thinks that Cobham  
 is an attractive place in which to    
 live,being close to London and the    
 coast.He thinks that improvements     
 could be made,it would be nice to have
 tea room and a better village hall.   
 Mr.Jackson has lived in Cobham all his
 life.He prefers living in the country 
 where there is a good community       
 spirit.                               
{Mr.Gibson}(the mayor of Gravesham)    
 would like to see more shops and      
 better pavements.He chose to live in  
 Cobham as it is in the country but    
 close to London,where he works.The    
 house he lives in is large,has a big  
 garden and is very peaceful.He spends 
 most of his spare time at home.He     
 attends the local church and other    
 village functions.
