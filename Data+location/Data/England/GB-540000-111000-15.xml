		<title>15BEE KEEPING IN COOKSBRIDGE</title>
		<content>{The countryside around Cooksbridge,   
{Hamsey and Offham is very good for    
{bee-keeping. This is because}there    
 are few people but many wild flowers  
 in the hedgerows as well as flowering 
 trees and cultivated flowers in the   
 many large gardens and country        
 estates. In addition crops such as oil
 seed rape and beans which are good for
 bees are popular with farmers in this 
 area.{                                
{Mr.Stephen Kelly}is one of several    
 local bee keepers. He has 7 hives     
 containing 250 000 bees. He used to   
 keep all his bees at Cooksbridge but  
 some of them were particularly vicious
 so he had to take them further away   
 from houses.                          
 Mr. Kelly produced{40kg of honey in   
{1984 from each hive}which he sold for 
{Â£2 a kg.}He akso sells the wax for    
 furniture polish.                     </content>
