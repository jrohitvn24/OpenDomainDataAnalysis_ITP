		<content> Hungerford Common is the only Common  
 around for miles.It covers an area    
 of about 19 acres.It has about 160    
 cows on it in the summer months.      
 Hungerford Common is also well known  
 for picnicing.There are  a number     
 of disused gravel pits.               
 There are also Commoners' Rights which
 allow you to put cattle on the Common 
 if you live in special houses down the
 High street.These allow you to put    
 2 to 4 cows on the Common also to fish
 in the Kennet and Avon canal.Commoners
 rights were given to Hungerford in    
 the 13th century by John'O'Gaunt.The  
 Common is maintained by the trustees  
 of the Town and Manor of Hungerford   
 which was set up in 1907 and the grass
 is kept under control by the cows.    
 Hungerford Common gives great pleasure
 to many people and their dogs.
