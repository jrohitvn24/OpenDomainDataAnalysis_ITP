		<content>  On Tuesday 16th of July 1985 the     
{Prince and Princess of Wales}came to  
{Sunnyside Primary School.             
 For the visit the Princess wore a red 
 and white spotted dress, red coat and 
 a red and white hat. Prince Charles   
 wore a black suit and a red tie.When  
 they arrived, Natalie, who was five   
 that day, presented  the Princess with
 a bouquet of flowers.Then they toured 
 the building starting at the nursery. 
 In the music room the choir and       
 orchestra sang and played for them.   
 When they reached the{partially       
{sighted unit}the Princess's heart was 
 touched when she saw Claire in her    
 wheelchair and she gave her a flower  
 from her bouquet. Before leaving they 
 signed a photograph for the school as 
 a souvenir of their visit. We all     
 gathered on the car park to cheer     
 as they left.                         </content>
