		<title>02Crow Hall Farm, Burwell</title>
		<content> The farm is 180 acres. The farmer     
 grows these crops: wheat, barley,     
 potatoes, peas, sugar beet, rape. He  
 plants potatoes most. The machinery   
 used for potatoes is Potato Topper    
 and Potato Coverer. He uses nitrogen, 
 phosphate and potash on his potatoes. 
                                       
 His second crop is autumm wheat. He   
 uses a weed-killer, non Nitrogen      
 O2424, for stopping weeds and thistles
 crawling up the wheat. He also uses   
 Trip Turbo. He is going to harvest    
 his wheat in October and his barley at
 the end of July.                      
                                       
 He stores his grain in bins which each
 hold 50 tonnes.
