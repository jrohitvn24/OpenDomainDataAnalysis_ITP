		<title>06The Origins of Rubery.</title>
		<content> The earliest references to Rubery are 
 to be found in 16th Century Deeds and 
 plans, indicating the quarry ridge at 
 the north-east end of the village as  
{"Roughberrow" (Rough Hill) or         
{Rowberrie.                            
 The small group of buildings a mile to
 the south-west was{"The Whetty",}and  
 the area to the south at the foot of  
 the Lickey Hills was described as the 
 hamlet of{"Etchey"}or{Eachway.        
 As each of the districts developed and
 merged, they became collectively      
 grouped under one name as Rubery.     
 The village itself is located in a    
 saucer-shaped area overlooked on the  
 south by the Waseley Hills, with      
 ground on all sides sloping down      
 towards the{Callow Brook}which starts 
 in the Waseley Hills and flows through
 the middle of Rubery,then onwards to  
 Birmingham.                           </content>
