		<title>17Farming near Guisborough I</title>
		<content> The 4 farms we looked at are in the N.
 Moors Nat.Park,to the S.of our area.  
 Highcliffe Farm is at 800 feet(the    
 highest in our area),&amp; has 122 acres. 
 It dates from 1830 &amp; the occupiers    
 have lived there 41 yrs.They have few 
 crops,but 70 cattle &amp; 400 sheep. A    
 govt.subsidy (for land over 600' high)
 is paid, which the farmer described   
 as 'Reasonable'. Dairy produce is     
 sold at Ruswarp near Whitby or North- 
 allerton; machinery,etc.comes from    
 Dalgetties,Northallerton or Armstrong 
 Richardson,Guisborough. Due to urban  
 dev'ment the farm is now on the town  
 outskirts.The same is true of Hunters 
 Hill Farm to the E. This is 150 acres 
 &amp; has 12 horses &amp; 20 pigs as well as  
 sheep.Pony trekking is a side line.   
 Relations between nearby estate &amp; farm
 are bad (smell, rubbish disposal. . .)
