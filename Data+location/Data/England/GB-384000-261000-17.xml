		<title>17Salwarpe Water Control</title>
		<content> In 1963 approval was given to a scheme
 to build an entirely new{water        
{pollution control works}in the        
 Salwarpe Valley to cater for the needs
 of the expanding town of Droitwich.   
 Three possible sites were assessed,   
 and the hamlet of{Ladywood,}(to the   
 east of Droitwich),was chosen. The    
 site is approx. 30 acres, and situated
 on the flood plain of the River       
 Salwarpe. The main works have been    
 designed to cope with an estimated    
 flow of{3,850,000 gallons daily.      
 Treatment of sewage began in{1970.    
 Apart from the usual sedimentation    
 tanks,bacteria and sludge-drying beds,
 an innovation from Holland was        
 installed,{a Pasveer Ditch,}where raw 
 sewage is subjected to prolonged and  
 intensive aeration and completely     
 purified.Surplus sludge can be dried, 
 or stored without objectionable odour.</content>
