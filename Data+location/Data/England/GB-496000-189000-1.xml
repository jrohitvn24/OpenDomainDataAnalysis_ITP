		<title>01CHALFONT AREA INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content> Our area covered in this project      
retains its old agricultural           
tendencies. Only one third of this     
area   is heavily populated,           
encompassing the small town of         
Gerrards Cross, two small villages,    
Seer Green and Jordans  and Chalfont   
St. Peter. A particularly interesting  
point about Chalfont St. Peter is that 
it is one of the largest villages in   
the country with a population of       
approximately 15,000. Gerrards Cross   
is a relatively new town, originally   
in the days of steam, it was a small   
hamlet, but after the arrival in the   
village of more sophisticated          
rail-travel in about 1906 Gerrards     
Cross grew quite quickly to its        
present size. Jordans is a very small  
village with a population of only 250. 
Seer Green is about 4 times the size   
of Jordans.                            </content>
