		<title>12TRAINING TO FIGHT FIRES</title>
		<content>   There are no specific qualifications
 needed to enter the school but        
 candidates need to pass an{intelli-   
{gence test}which consists mainly of   
 general knowledge. They also need to  
 pass a{practical exam}and a{medical.  
   The recruits are trained in first   
 aid and are required to have a heavy  
 goods vehicle driving license to drive
 the large fire appliances.            
   The course involves the{theory}of   
 fires as well as{practical work       
 extinguishing fires on old planes with
 the fire appliances.                  
   When the students return to their   
 own air fields, they must have a good 
 knowledge of the layout and topology  
 of their field in order to reach a    
 fire quickly.                         
   As yet,{no women recruits}have      
 embarked on the course, because of its
 physical demands.                     </content>
