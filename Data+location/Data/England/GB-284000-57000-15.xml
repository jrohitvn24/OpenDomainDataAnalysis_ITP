		<content> Development started in the area       
 because jobs were needed.The council  
 decided to buy land to build roads,   
 sewers and sell plots to              
 industrialist.The site is a good one  
 because it is not close to any houses 
 and so transport,coming or going,does 
 not disturb local residents.          
 Some of the land was reclaimed for old
 brick pits,by controlled tipping,and  
 the rest was farmed.There are 21 units
 including 9 small workshop units.Most 
 units are used for light industry e.g.
 making window frame and processing    
 seafoods.One site was sold to Devon   
 C.C.for the refuse transfer station.  
 Approximatly between 220 _ 300 jobs   
 will be provided.Further work has     
 started to develop 20 acres of        
 adjacient land to provide more units.
