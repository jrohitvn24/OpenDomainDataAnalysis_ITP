		<title>02DOWN SCHOOL</title>
		<content>{  The Down School}is situated in a    
 rural area near Bridgnorth, once      
 called Chetton Down.                  
                                       
   The school has a population of{56}  
{children}with 3 teaching and 4 other  
 staff. There are 3 classes; the       
 infants are taught in the original    
 building which was built in the last  
 century, then below the infants       
 class are the junior classes. These   
 are demountable classes which get very
 hot in summer.                        
                                       
    The teachers have frequent help    
 from mothers, who take small groups.  
 There is no school field so pupils    
 use the farmers field next to or      
 opposite  the school for P.E. and     
 games, if the grass is not too long.  
 Swimming takes place weekly in        
 Bridgnorth Leisure Centre.            </content>
