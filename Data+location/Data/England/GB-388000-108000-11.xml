		<title>11Farming in Pimperne.</title>
		<content> Mr Boyt,who farms Manor Farm,has been 
 farming all his life and has lived in 
 Pimperne for 14 years.His farm has    
 grown in size but he has the same     
 number of men working for him.He has  
 more and bigger machinery and has     
 doubled the yield of corn he can get  
 from one acre.He has 130 friesian     
 dairy cows,30 sheep,called mules,and a
 cross between Swaledale and Border    
 Leicester,and 40 calves.He grows      
 winter wheat and barley and rotates   
 crops every 2 years.Mr Boyt is keen on
 conservation.He believes hedges may be
 removed for the sake of efficiency    
 but what is removed must be replaced. 
 He cannot say what changes may come in
 the future.The European Economic      
 Community fixes prices and there is a 
 surplus of farm products.The future   
 depends on the decisions of           
 politicians.                          </content>
