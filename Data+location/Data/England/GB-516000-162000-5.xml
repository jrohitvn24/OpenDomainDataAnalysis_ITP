{STAFF (conducted by the pupils of

  HISTORY OF THE ZOO                   
                                       
 The zoo &amp; funfair opened in 1931, and 
 the complex stands on a 65 acre site  
 excluding land purchased which is not 
 yet fully integrated into the zoo.When
 Madame Tussaud's bought the business 2
 years ago, a major investment scheme  
 was launched; Â£4.5 million has been   
 spent on enlarging and improving the  
 enclosures.  A new ape house opened   
 last year.                            
{ACQUISITIONS }We would like to acquire
 some okapi (a type of antelope), since
 these are very rare. We've just bought
 3 lemurs &amp; some palm cockatoos.
