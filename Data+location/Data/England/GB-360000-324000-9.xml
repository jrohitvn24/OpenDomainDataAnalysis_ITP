		<title>09OUR VILLAGE BLACKSMITH</title>
		<content>   In Peplow we are very lucky to still
 have a village Blacksmith. His forge  
 is still the same as it was fifty     
 years ago except that the bellows are 
 now worked by electricity instead of  
 manually. The present Blacksmith came 
 here as an apprentice to our former   
 farrier.                              
   The area he serves is very large and
 horses are brought to him to be shod  
 or he makes their shoes and then      
 travels to their stables to shoe them.
 He also spends much time travelling   
 around, not only this country, but    
 America also, judging at shows and    
 demonstrating his skills for which he 
 has won many great prizes.            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
