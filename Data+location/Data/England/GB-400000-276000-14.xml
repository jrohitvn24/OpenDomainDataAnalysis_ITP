		<content>The phone is a good idea but there is  
one thing I don't like and that is the 
bill! Some people deserve the price. My
mom does. She's on the phone from one  
o'clock until we come home, and even   
longer. My dad is not like that on the 
phone. Just a quick hello and a quick  
goodbye. I write to all the family.    
I write to my aunts and uncles, my nans
and grandads and they all write back.  
Sometimes I write a special thank you  
letter for when the look after us. The 
same as when we go on holiday. I always
send my relatives a postcard saying    
what it's like and how the weather is. 
There is another way of keeping in     
touch and that is by C.B. radio. I     
used to have a radio and I would listen
to them speaking. I know a girl's name 
Rosebush and another, Nescafe          
                                       
                                       </content>
