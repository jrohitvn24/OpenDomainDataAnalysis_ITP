		<title>07The Wildlife of Knockholt</title>
		<content> The many woods and copses encourage a 
 wide variety of wildlife; foxes,roe   
 and fallow deer, badgers, mink,hares, 
 grey squirrels, stoats, weasels, bats 
 and small mammals of all sorts are    
 found here, also rabbits in a variety 
 of colours. The lake near Combe Wood  
 has a heronery and other water birds. 
 Watercress grows where springs come   
 from the chalk. Barn and tawny owls   
 can be heard if not seen. All the     
 common hedgerow and garden birds      
 abound as there are many wooded and   
 uncultivated corners. Pheasants,      
 reared for shooting, are a common     
 sight also lapwings, curlews, yellow  
 hammers, nuthatches, tree-creepers,   
 Canada geese and kestrels. Butterflies
 and moths seen include blue           
 butterflies on the chalk slopes,      
 dragonflies, tortoise-shells, peacocks
 and red admirals.                     </content>
