		<content>  Fortunately for the peace of Baldock 
 residents, the A1(M) bypass runs to   
 the west of the block, taking N-S     
 through traffic with it.              
                                       
  However, there is still a traffic    
 problem as the main E-W route from    
 Cambridge to Luton (A505) runs        
 diagonally through the block to the   
 Baldock traffic lights.  This section 
 of road is probably the most dangerous
 in Herts., as from the lights to the  
 dual carriageway on the eastern edge  
 of the block, the single carriageway  
 twists deceptively, causing impatient 
 drivers to overtake unwisely.         
                                       
  Plans for an E-W bypass for Baldock  
 include a Northern route, running     
 through the block, but this is still  
 under discussion.
