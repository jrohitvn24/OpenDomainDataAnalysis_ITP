		<title>14Interview with Mr.Norton.</title>
		<content>     The Norton family have worked as  
 bakers in Mattishall for a century.   
 A hundred years ago all the dough was 
 mixed by hand and baked in ovens      
 heated by coal fires. The ovens then  
 were much bigger:half the size of the 
 whole of the present bakery! Now they 
 make cakes as well as bread but in the
 old days people used to make their own
 cakes and bring them to the bakery to 
 be cooked in the ovens.               
     Much more brown bread is eaten now
 than it used to be:twenty years ago it
 was only one loaf in ten,now about    
 four loaves in ten are brown.         
     The bakery has about one thousand 
 customers per week:between 150 and 200
 per day.The shop is open for six hours
 per day,but Mr.Norton starts work     
 at 05.00 and finishes at 18.00 when   
 the shop closes.Most of his recipes   
 are secret,many are old-fashioned.    </content>
