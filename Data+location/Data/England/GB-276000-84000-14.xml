		<content>   Tourists attracted to this area are 
 those seeking a peaceful outdoor count
 ry holiday.                           
   Accommodation is offered through bed
 breakfast and evening meal at         
 guesthouses and farmhouses or holiday 
 cottages which are let out for self_  
 catering.Cream teas are available dur_
 ing the summer but there are no pubs, 
 hotels or restaurants to offer        
 refreshment to the visitor.           
   The main attraction is of course the
 outstanding natural beauty of the area
 which is largely unspoilt by modern   
 developments or building.Apart from   
 the rifle range at Budleigh which att_
 racts a large number of visitors each 
 year there are no man_made attractions
  _ just acres of farmland and forest, 
 topped by the panoramic views obtained
 from Hingston and Blackingstone Rocks.
