		<content> In the combined parishes of{Lilleshall
{,Chetwynd Aston }and{Church Aston,}   
 very few mothers now work full time   
 ,although some work part              
 time.Approx.50% of the people have    
 most of their meals in front of the   
 T.V.,although the majority of these   
 have regular Sunday dinner.The number 
 of church goers in our area has fallen
 to very low , and the number of       
 children attending Sunday School has  
 dropped considerably as well. Most of 
 the people in the three communities   
 have not been abroad, although        
 everybody has been on holiday . A lot 
 of people among the ones that go      
 abroad stay in a tent when they go on 
 holiday away from our country.Most    
 people in the area go swimming for    
 pleasure .Although almost nobody does 
 orienteering in our area walking is   
 quite popular.                        </content>
