		<title>17PINDEN END FARM QUARRY</title>
		<content>    Chalk quarrying began in 1916 to   
 provide lime for hand-made bricks in  
 the local brickfields. The exception- 
 ally pure calcium carbonate produced  
 was later used to manufacture white-  
 wash, but the works were closed down  
 after the development of synthetic    
 paints. Production then switched to   
 agricultural lime, and now 20,000 tons
 are quarried annually. The lime is    
 distributed throughout{Kent, Sussex,  
{ Hertfordshire}and{Suffolk}and is also
 exported to many parts of the world.  
 As it is very soft and pure, with a   
 calcium carbonate content of 98.4%,   
 the lime is used in several trades,   
 including steel production, the fur   
 and cosmetic trades, and in ornamental
 plaster work. The flints extracted    
 during quarrying are not discarded but
 pulverized and used to glaze pottery  
 and restore ancient monuments.        </content>
