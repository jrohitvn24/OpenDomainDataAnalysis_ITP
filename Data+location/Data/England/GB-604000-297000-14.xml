		<title>14Norfolk Agricultural Station</title>
		<content> The Norfolk Agricultural Station was  
 set up about 100 years ago and is a   
 private organisation with charitable  
 status.                               
 The station moved to Morley from      
 Sprowston Hall about 20 years ago.    
 Currently it uses about 450 acres of  
 land and employs a permanent staff of 
 17, including the farm staff. Staff   
 from other institutions, such as the  
 Ministry of Agriculture are often     
 seconded to the Station to work on    
 particular projects.                  
 Funding is partly from the members of 
 the charity, but largely from         
 sponsorship for research.             
 The Agricultural Station gives much   
 help to the local community by        
 allowing use of their land and helping
 with labour for village projects.
