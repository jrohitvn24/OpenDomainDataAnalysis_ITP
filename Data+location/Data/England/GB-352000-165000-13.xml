		<content>{HANGING GROVE FARM IS A DAIRY FARM.   
 They have 150 acres for 330 cows.Every
 morning Mr Pearce and his son get up  
 at 04.45 and start work at 05.00.     
  When a calf is born they keep        
 it at the farm in the cowshed for     
 8-10 weeks to make sure that it is    
 healthy and to have its horns burnt   
 off. After that it is allowed back in 
 the field with its mum.               
 Mr.Pearce also has 40 sheep. They have
 to dip the sheep twice a year round   
 about July and August and then again  
 between September and November.  The  
 sheep are dipped to keep them healthy.
