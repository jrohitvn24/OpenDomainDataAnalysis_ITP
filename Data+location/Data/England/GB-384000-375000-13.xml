		<title>13ALDERLEY EDGE COPPER MINES</title>
		<content> People say that the mines on the Edge 
 were dug by the Romans.However we have
 looked on the Ordanance Survey Map of 
 Roman Britain and this does not show  
 any mines on Alderley Edge.We do know 
 that mining was carried on as far back
 as the Bronze Age.In 1777 just about  
 all the metal dug out in England  came
 from the mines at Alderley Edge.They  
 dug out lead,copper and black cobalt  
 ore.In 1871 a boiler exploded at the  
 mines causing great damage _ also the 
 landlord at that time did not want the
 company to carry on mining and so the 
 mines were closed.The mines and shafts
 have now been blocked up for safety   
 reasons,but there is one shaft you can
 go down with a guide. As you walk in  
 the area you can still pick up pieces 
 of lead and copper ore.
