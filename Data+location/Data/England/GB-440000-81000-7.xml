		<title>07BRIGHSTONE PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content>  The village school was opened in 1836
 and this makes it 149 years old. The  
 original building still makes up the  
 bulk of the school. It is built of    
 stone. Later brick additions to the   
 building also house the classrooms    
 today.                                
  The school has children from the age 
 of five to nine. Some four year olds  
 are taken just before their fifth     
 birthday. There are 104 pupils at the 
 moment and four teachers including the
 headmaster.                           
  Schooldays start at 8.30am and end at
 2.45pm. Most of the children do not   
 have far to come as they live in the  
 village.                              
  The children do netball, cricket and 
 football. The school also has its own 
 small swimming pool outside which is  
 ideal for learners.
