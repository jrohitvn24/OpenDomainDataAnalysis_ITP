		<content> The block is primarily devoted to     
 agriculture, with arable predominant -
 wheat and oilseed rape. Some store and
 fat cattle are maintained in byres and
 on small areas of grassland. There is 
 some intensive pig and poultry        
 rearing. Much of the arable land has  
 been 'prairie-fied' with hedges and   
 boundaries removed to give very large 
 continuous fields. This factor,       
 combined with the death of the elms,  
 results in a wide, open landscape.    
 Some tree re-planting is in hand. the 
 block includes Old Weston and part of 
 Brington. Old Weston is a small       
 village with some outlying farms.     
 Recent house building has brought in  
 some newcomers, generally younger     
 families working outside the village  
 for apart from the small numbers      
 engaged in agriculture, there is no   
 local source of employment. R.A.F.    </content>
