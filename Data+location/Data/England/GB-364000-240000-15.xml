		<content> The Box Bush and Hopton Arms use      
 Whitbread Flowers as a brewery. The   
 most popular beers for the Box Bush   
 are pale ale and bitter beer but for  
 the Hopton Arms it is  Flowers. The   
 opening times are nearly the same     
 except that the Box Bush opens from   
 10.00-2.30 and the Hopton Arms opens  
 from 10.30-2.00. The Box Bush doesn't 
 supply bar food but the Hopton Arms   
 does. The people who own the Box Bush 
 have been there for 60 years and the  
 people who own the Hopton Arms have   
 been there for 3\ years. The people   
 who own the Hopton Arms came from     
 Knighton. At the Hopton Arms they are 
 converting the stables into a changing
 room for the football team. The Box   
 Bush does not cater for families but  
 the Hopton does. The Hopton Arms has a
 field which can accomodate 30 - 40    
 caravans and tents.                   </content>
