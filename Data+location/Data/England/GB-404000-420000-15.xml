		<content> Since the landscape is so hilly and   
 the houses and farms are so widely    
 separated, it is usual to find homes  
 which have no mains{drainage,}no mains
{water}supply, and no mains{gas}supply.
 Many homes are fitted with{           
{wood-burning stoves,}use{spring water,
 and drain their sewage into{septic    
{tanks.}                               
 One house, the home of a computer     
 lecturer, has a custom built system   
 for providing hot water, and for      
 operating the central heating. Three  
 sources of{energy}are used. An open   
 fire in the large lounge has a back   
 boiler. An alternative is a           
 wood-burning stove situated in the    
{cellar.}Should either of these not    
 produce sufficient heat, then a{butane
{gas}system is automatically triggered 
 to take over or to supplement the     
 system.                               </content>
