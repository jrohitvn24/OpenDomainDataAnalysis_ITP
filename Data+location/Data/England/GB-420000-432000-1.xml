		<title>01PUDSEY - GAZETTEER</title>
		<content>{  }PUDSEY(pop.32,000) lies 4 miles    
 east of Bradford and 6 miles west of  
 Leeds and is the focal point of this  
 block.It was previously a municipal   
 borough (1899),absorbing the nearby   
 villages of Farsley and Calverley in  
 1937.It is now part of the Leeds Metro
 District Council,but its inhabitants  
 still identify PUDSEY as their        
 hometown.                             
    PUDSEY is typical of many small    
 Yorkshire towns,being mainly stone-   
 built with later developments in red  
 brick.It lives up to the 'Dark Satanic
 Mills' image with about 20 mills      
 dotted around the area.Many of these  
 mills are no longer used to produce   
 cloth but now have other uses.Despite 
 its industrial past there is much very
 beautiful countryside within easy     
 reach.The Yorkshire Dales are only 30 
 minutes away by car.                  </content>
