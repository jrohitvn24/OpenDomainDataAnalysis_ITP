		<content>{Chapeltown station}is served by the   
{Hallam Link Line.}The children found  
 that it had limited facilities - it is
 like a{'bus stop'.}No-one is employed 
 there. The trains connect to{Barnsley,
{Sheffield, Wakefield and Leeds,}      
 calling at local stations. Over 90% of
 those surveyed said they rarely used  
 the station, although this fell to 70%
 of those who lived closer to the      
 station.                              
 There is a good cheap bus service to  
 all major towns in the area. Transport
 policy means a journey costs{15p for  
{adults and 2p for children,}compared  
 to 75p for a comparative journey in   
 other towns. There is a bus pass      
 system for O.A.Ps. Nevertheless{50%   
 of the survey sample{rarely used a    
{bus.}Residents in High Green feel a   
 more direct service to Sheffield is   
 needed, this is to be improved.       </content>
