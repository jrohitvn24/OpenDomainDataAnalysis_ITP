		<title>01SOUTH-WEST TELFORD</title>
		<content> The area we have covered is very mixed
 in character.Our area is traditionally
 an industrial and agricultural one,   
 Telford being described as the        
 "birthplace of the industrial         
 revolution".There are remnants of the 
 old mining and smelting industries    
 still to be found,such as the old     
 Court Works in Madeley,and            
 agricultural land is also in evidence.
 However,Telford is now a major growth 
 area,and new housing is mushrooming in
 the area to accomodate the overspill  
 population from Birmingham and other  
 parts of the West Midlands.The area is
 now,therefore,predominantly           
 a residential one,with vestiges of its
 old uses still in evidence.These stand
 side by side with new industries,which
 employ the recently-arrived workforce 
 and are mainly in the engineering     
 field.                                </content>
