		<title>04Rose Queen Festival,Mellor.</title>
		<content> On Saturday it was the Rose Queen     
 Festival in Mellor.First we had a     
 service in church when the Rose Queen 
 was crowned .I was in the choir then  
 we walked round the village.The       
 procession was called "The Procession 
 of Witness".The Sunday school,Day     
 school and a band followed us round   
 the Village too.There was a big Church
 banner which followed us.             
 We stopped outside the Spar shop to   
 sing a hymn called "Jesus shall       
 reign".Then we carried on with the    
 Procession.We passed the Smith's fruit
 shop and walked up to Church and      
 sang"The Church's One Foundation"and  
 then we went back to Church and       
 changed our choir robes.After that we 
 went into School and had tea.Keith    
 flicked a bit of jelly at Christopher 
 and it landed in his drink.Then we    
 went into the field and had sports.   </content>
