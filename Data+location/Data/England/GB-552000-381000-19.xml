		<title>19The Mayor of Sutton on Sea.</title>
		<content> The Mayor of Sutton and Mablethorpe   
 now is{Mrs P.Ash}but when we started  
 this survey it was Mr J.Bromwich.He   
 became Mayor because he had been on   
 the Council for a long time.People    
 used to call him "Mr.Mayor" which was 
 embarrasing.He has a greengrocery shop
 and sometimes it was hard to run the  
 shop as well as be Mayor.He has been  
 to lots of dinners but made only 2    
 speeches.He has not changed much while
 he was Mayor but he managed to get    
 lights on the promenade and the       
 colonnade painted.He also helped raise
 Â£500 for the swimming pool fund.He    
 think the people in Sutton are very   
 friendly.He has lived here for l6     
 years.He likes it her because it      
 is quiet but he does not like the     
 vandals.His job involves being        
 chairman of the Town Council.His chain
 is made of gold and is very heavy.    </content>
