		<title>01Langham &amp; The Area SSE</title>
		<content> This area is of gently undulating     
 farmland about 150ft above sea level. 
 Langham built around a crossroads is  
 the largest of the three villages with
 a considerable amount of new          
 residential development, the others,  
 much smaller, with only infilling     
 within the village envelopes.   The   
 area is one of mixed farming, barley, 
 oil-seed rape and sugar beet and some 
 rough grazing for cattle.   The fields
 are large with hedges and a small     
 amount of hedgerow timber, a few areas
 given over to rough plantations.   Old
 marsh pits occur in some fields and   
 the remains of old  gravel workings on
 the glacial Ercar.   Employment is on 
 the land, in a recently established   
 glass house and in nearby towns.   A  
 number of holiday homes and much      
 visited in the summer.   A wide       
 village street, a village green, flint</content>
