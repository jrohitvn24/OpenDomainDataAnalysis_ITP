		<title>01DESCRIPTION OF HERODSFOOT</title>
		<content>  THIS BLOCK ONLY CONTAINS ONE VILLAGE 
 WITH A FEW SCATTERED FARMHOUSES. MUCH 
 OF THE BLOCK IS FOREST OWNED BY THE   
 FORESTRY COMMISSION AND KNOWN AS THE  
 KERNOW FOREST.(KERNOW IS CORNISH FOR  
 CORNWALL). THERE IS OTHER WOODLAND IN 
 THE BLOCK, BOTH DECIDUOUS AND         
 CONIFEROUS, OWNED BY LOCAL FARMERS.   
  THE BLOCK IS ALSO CHARACTERISED BY   
 MANY RIVERS, TEN STREAMS COMING       
 TOGETHER TO FORM THE WEST LOOE RIVER. 
 THE LAND IS THEREFORE CUT INTO MANY   
 DEEP VALLEYS, AND ROADS ARE FEW.      
  HERODSFOOT WAS A MINING VILLAGE,WITH 
 TWO MINES,MINING SILVER,LEAD AND TIN. 
 THERE WERE A LOT MORE HOUSES, THREE   
 PUBS, A COFFEE HOUSE AND A MEN'S CLUB.
 ALL THESE HAVE NOW GONE.              
  MOST LOCAL JOBS ARE IN FORESTRY,     
 FARMING,(CATTLE,SHEEP AND ARABLE), AND
 TOURISM. THERE IS NO PUBLIC TRANSPORT 
 BUT PEOPLE CAN COMMUTE BY CAR. (CONTD)</content>
