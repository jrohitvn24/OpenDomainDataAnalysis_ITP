		<title>13TRADE IN BEAMINSTER</title>
		<content> Trade is confined to the section of   
 Beaminster within our block.  One     
 street in central Beaminster has a    
 baker, a draper, butcher, woolshop,   
 carpet shop, 2 antique shops, 1       
 specialising in clocks, the other     
 in pine and country furniture,        
 newsagency, postoffice with stationery
 and an estate agent.  In the centre   
 are the premises of a tractor sales   
 and servicing company, a building     
 contractor, a plumbing and heating    
 engineering firm and a road surfacing 
 company.  There is a licensed hotel,  
 pubs and a garage.  On the outskirts  
 of Beaminster a former builder's yard 
 now houses several small businesses   
 and 4 new Co SIRA units have also been
 built;  2 are occupied by a motor     
 mechanic and an upholsterer.  The     
 majority of these businesses do not   
 change hands very often.              </content>
