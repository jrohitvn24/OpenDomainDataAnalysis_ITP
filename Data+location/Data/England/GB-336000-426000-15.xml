		<content> The Police Station in Lytham was built
 in l890.The Station contains four     
 cells, but prisoners are not kept     
 there for more than 3 days.Upstairs   
 there is a Court Room.Lytham provides 
 22 Police personnel for the Borough.  
 The most common offences in Lytham are
 drunkenness and house break-ins.These 
 break-ins occur about l0 to l5 times a
 week.This is the major worry of the   
 Crime Prevention Officer.In the Summer
 people leave doors and windows open   
 which is ideal for criminals.When     
 people  garden and decorate they leave
 equipment, ladders outside which      
 enable the thief to gain easy access. 
   With Lytham being a holiday centre  
 shopkeepers are being encouraged to   
 watch out for shoplifters.An ideal    
 escape route to Manchester and        
 Liverpool is afforded by the          
 M55/M6/M6l motorways.                 </content>
