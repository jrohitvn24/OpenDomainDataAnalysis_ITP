		<title>13Wareham's Mayor.</title>
		<content> The Mayor of Wareham is Mr.Albert     
 Sutton.Mr.Sutton has been Mayor for 2 
 years and he enjoys his job.His duties
 include chairing meetings,going to    
 civic events ie.fetes and jumble sales
 going to important services at the    
 church and receiving complaints or    
 praise from the citizens of Wareham.  
 He thinks the worst point about       
 Wareham is the increasing vandalism   
 costing the council a lot of money.   
 The best thing is the town itself with
 its historic and beautiful            
 surroundings.Another good thing is the
 school activities going on in the     
 town.Wareham has hardly changed in the
 last 900 years and he hopes it won't  
 in the next 900 years,by demolition   
 experts destroying the old houses and 
 roads for modern buildings.
