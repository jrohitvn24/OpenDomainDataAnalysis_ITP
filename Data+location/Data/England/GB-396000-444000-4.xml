		<title>04CONONLEY LEAD MINE:1</title>
		<content> The remains of Cononley lead mine can 
 be found on the moors of Cononley and 
 Glusburn.                             
 The Royalties of Cononley moor belong 
 to the Duke of Devonshire.            
 Permission was first given to work the
 mine by Henry V111 in 1530 AD but it  
 is not known when the mining actually 
 began.                                
 The population of the village of      
 Cononley increased to over 1,500      
 inhabitants due to the influx of      
 miners from Derbyshire, Cornwall and  
 Wales.                                
 The large increase in the population  
 and the pollution from the mine water 
 forced the Duke of Devonshire to build
 new water supplies. The new wells were
 built by public subscription and were 
 placed by the institute, the Co_op,   
 Cross Farm and Calverts Lane.
