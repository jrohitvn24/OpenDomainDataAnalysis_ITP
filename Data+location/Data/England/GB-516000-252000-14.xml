		<title>14French Kier Construction</title>
		<content> Over 50 years ago Olaf Kier left      
 Denmark to tour Europe but, he was to 
 remain in England where he built an   
 international construction company    
 whose main headquaters are now based  
 at Tempsford Bedfordshire.            
 In 1928 Kier and his partner Nielsen  
 established a small building firm,its 
 first job was the construction of a   
 concrete bridge in Bath cost Â£500.In  
 1933 the company was renamed Lotz &amp;   
 Kier and the offices moved from Stoke 
 to Allington House Victoria London.   
 The companies construction activites  
 continued to expand into many new     
 areas. Years of hard work and great   
 gambles paid dividends .Turnover has  
 rapidly increased since the company   
 went public in 1963.
