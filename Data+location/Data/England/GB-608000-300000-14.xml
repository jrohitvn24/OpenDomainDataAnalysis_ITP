		<content>{By THERESA GUTHRIE                    
   I live in the countryside. It is    
 different from the town as it is less 
 noisy because there is less traffic.  
   There are four farms where I live   
 so there is often a strong smell of   
 manure. Also there is a lot of other  
 pollution from chemicals in the       
 fields.                               
   It is sometimes boring as there     
 are not many people around so I often 
 go for a bike ride in the countryside 
 and see rabbits in the fields. I also 
 see a lot of squashed animals in the  
 road which I find disturbing. I go    
 horse riding with my friend who has   
 two ponies.                           
   We have quite a big garden so we    
 grow our own vegetables. There is also
 a fruit and vegetable farm. I watch   
 the television most of the time       
 because there isn't much else to do.  </content>
