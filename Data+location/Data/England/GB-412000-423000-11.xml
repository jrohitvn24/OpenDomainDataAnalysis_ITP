		<title>11ST ANDREWS JUNIOR SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Our school is on Waterloo Road, it was
 opened on the 14th September, 1973.   
 Next to our school is a church. The   
 church is called St Martin's and was  
 opened in 1831. The school has 10     
 classrooms and it is made of brick.   
 The houses around the school are      
 mostly terraced houses. There is a    
 pub called The Crown and this is about
 400 yards from the school. Next to the
 school is a fire station and an       
 ambulance station. Sometimes the      
 firemen have games of football which  
 we can watch. There are two fire      
 trucks and three fire engines and     
 about six ambulances. There is a      
 library next to the church and it is  
 built out of stone.
