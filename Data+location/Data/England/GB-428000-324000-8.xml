		<content> Most of the{farmers}interviewed had   
 farms with a large acreage, the sample
 ranged from 49 to 1500 acres. Most    
 farmers employed workers but the      
 maximum number was 9. Only a few      
 farmers had lived on their farms for  
 all of their lives, but most had      
 worked their farms for over 10 years. 
 Of the 7 farmers interviewed, 2 were  
 entirely dairy, 1 entirely cereal and 
 the rest were mixed farms.            
 The total for livestock from this     
 sample was 104 dairy cows, 3605 sheep 
 and 170 other cattle.                 
 4 of the farms are situated on the    
 outskirts of Newton Solney and Repton.
 There is one farm actually in         
 the village of Repton and two in      
 Newton Solney
