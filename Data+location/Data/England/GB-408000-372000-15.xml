   The farm is very old -it was built  
 in 1845. It is about 85 hectares or   
 200 acres. The farm has been made much
 smaller since it started because of { 
{Tunstead Quarry.}The farm does have   
 livestock: about 20 cows,20 sheep and 
 poultry. The cows milk at the farm.   
 They{don't employ any workers.}The    
 livestock is self-produced: they don't
 buy anything from the outside.        
   They make hay to feed the sheep and 
 cows for the winter.The{wool is sent  
{to Bradford}at 50p per pound. On the  
 farm they have a big hay shed then    
 they have a loft which stores the     
 overflow of the hay. And they have    
 about 2 older sheds. They have sheds  
 to keep the poultry in. The farmer    
 enjoys his life.
