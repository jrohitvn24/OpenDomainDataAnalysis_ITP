		<title>10CAROLINE'S DAY AT KNEESALL</title>
		<content>  On Sunday night I go to bed at 9.00  
 o'clock. I wake up in the morning at  
 about five minutes to eight. I don't  
 have any breakfast.At a quarter to    
 nine I set off to go to my new        
 school.I have just come to live in the
 village of Kneesall.At five minutes to
 nine school starts.Sometimes I do     
 Maths before play.After play we write 
 a story or see a television programme 
 At dinner time I have a hot meal, and 
 then go to play outside if it is fine.
 After dinner we sometimes do art.After
 play we have a story or we read. At   
 3.25 we go home.When I'm home if it's 
 a nice day I play outside, sometimes  
 with my older sister otherwise I watch
 television.Each night I go to bed at  
 9.00 o'clock ready for another day at 
 school.This is a day in my life.
