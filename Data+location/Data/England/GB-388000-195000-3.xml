		<title>03LANDSCAPE AND OLD BUILDINGS</title>
		<content>   A feature of the{LANDSCAPE}in this  
 area are the many old Cotswold        
{BUILDINGS.}The traditional style is   
 that of the terraced cottage, plain   
 fronted , built of{COTSWOLD}limestone,
 with a stone tiled roof and wooden    
 support beams. Many of the houses and 
 cottages have changed both their use  
 and their appearance over the years.  
 One example is the "Gibbons           
 Restaurant" (formerly the Bell        
 Inn) which used to be five separate   
 tiny dwellings. "Penny Farthing", a   
 cottage in the High Street, was       
 coverted from a tailor's shop, a sweet
 shop and a bakery. The foundation of  
 one wing of Brook House, a large      
 country house, dates from 1088 when it
 was an old barn. The{FARMING}landscape
 also features Cotswold buildings.     
 "Star Farm" is a fine looking Cotswold
 farmhouse but is isolated from others.</content>
