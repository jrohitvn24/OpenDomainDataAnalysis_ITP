		<title>13THE SPETCHELS, PRUDHOE</title>
		<content> The ICI heaps are a range of lime     
 hills stretching along the River      
 Tyne. They are about 37m high and the 
 longest one is about 1Km long. The    
 lime heaps were dumped there in the   
 1940s by the ICI. The lime was used   
 for making acidic farmland more       
 alkaline. They stopped using it       
 because it got carried into the rivers
 and was killing the fish. Rumour has  
 it that there were some men who found 
 a lorry full of whisky and they buried
 it where the lime heaps are now. It   
 is supposed to be still there. Locally
 the lime heaps are also known as the  
 Spetchels and are now covered by      
 grass, moss and shrubs which provide  
 homes for butterflies, grouse, rats   
 and many other forms of insect and    
 wild life.                            
 At present there are no plans to      
 remove the Spetchels.                 </content>
