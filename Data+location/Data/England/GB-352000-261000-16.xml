		<content> Mrs Jones took in washing.She lit a   
 furnace to boil the water and ironed  
 on a table with an iron heated over   
 the fire.She also did casual farm work
 and remembers the annual Mayfair as   
 the only holiday.They ate very little 
 meat,only rabbit and bacon from the   
 pig,but lots of vegetables and steam  
 puddings.                             
      Although unqualified  she was    
 always called in for births,illness   
 and laying out.All births took        
 place at home and she would attend    
 the mother while someone walked or    
 cycled to fetch the doctor. Mr Jones  
 dug the graves and rang the death bell
 at the church.                        
     As a child on Sundays she went to 
 church in  the morning,Sunday school  
 in the afternoon and church again at  
 night.She walked to the local school  
 and left at age 14.                   </content>
