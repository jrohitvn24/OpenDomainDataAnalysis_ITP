		<content>{Computers}used to be as big as rooms, 
 infact they were rooms with components
 all over the wall.Now thanks to the   
 micro chip, computers have become     
 smaller and smaller.For instance the  
 Spectrum is a very small computer it  
 is about 30 cm long and that holds    
 more memory than one of those rooms.  
 Some computers hold 1 megobite which  
 is 1000k and that computer is as big  
  as a Spectrum.Most people in Tickhill
 use the Spectrum for games because    
 that computer has an easy language    
 to learn and its easy to make games   
 for.It is the most popular machine    
 available.That is why it has the      
 biggest range of games in the world.  
 They use the BBC for programming      
 just as much as games.It has very     
 high resolution{graphics}so it        
 can{design}things well and so it      
 needs a special monitor.              </content>
