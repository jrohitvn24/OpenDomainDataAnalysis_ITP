		<title>03NOSTELL PRIORY ESTATE</title>
		<content>{Nostell Priory}estate dominates much  
 of the Western area of our D-Block and
 has been owned by the{Winn}family     
 since 1654. It comprises over 2,5OO   
 acres of parkland, woodland, 3 lakes, 
 farmland and numerous cottages as well
 as the Priory itself.                 
 The estate employs over forty people  
 who work in such varied jobs as       
 running  the garden centre, working   
 for the{National Trust,}and running   
 the holiday homes as well as those in 
 farming.                              
 Although the estate farms some of the 
 land itself most of the land is let   
 out to tenants who are involved in    
 both arable and pasture farming.      
 The estate holds many special events  
 each year such as the country fair,   
 bonfire nights and music festivals.   
{Pop festivals}have now been cancelled 
 because of{drugs}problems.            </content>
