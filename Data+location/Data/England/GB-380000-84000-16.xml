		<content> Once a month a Mobile Baby Clinic     
 visits the village.The doctor holds a 
 surgery twice a week.Several villagers
 told us that they  missed having a    
 doctor living in the village.They were
 also sorry that a Policeman no longer 
 lives in the village.Winfrith is now  
 served by a Community Policeman who   
 lives in Wool.He also visits the      
 school to talk to us about Road Safety
 Winfrith First School has pupils which
 come from Chaldon,East Knighton       
 Villages as well as Winfrith Newburgh.
 The headmistress,Mrs.J.Watson,teaches 
 the Juniors,while Mrs.G.Graham takes  
 the Infant Class.A part_time teacher  
 Mrs.O.Good comes to school on three   
 mornings a week.The children are aged 
 from five to nine years.At nine they  
 go to Bovington Middle SChool.
