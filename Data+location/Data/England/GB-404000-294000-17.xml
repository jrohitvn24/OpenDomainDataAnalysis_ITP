		<title>17  A MODERN MOTEL</title>
		<content> The Post House Hotel is situated near 
 Junction 7 of the M6. It is a large   
 hotel with 204 bedrooms and the       
 busiest time of their year is early   
 July. The hotel has an average staff  
 of 80 people. A single room costs     
 Â£35.50 for bed and breakfast for one  
 night. This is roughly the same as an 
 old age pensioner is paid for a week! 
 Most people only stay one night and   
 continue their journey on the         
 motorway the following morning.       
 Facilities include a swimming pool, a 
 barbecue, two bars and attractive     
 landscaped gardens. The bars are open 
 until 10.30 p.m. and the restaurants  
 are popular with local residents. The 
 most frequently ordered dish is steak.
 Staff wear a special uniform. They say
 that although most visitors are       
 English, quite a few come from abroad.
