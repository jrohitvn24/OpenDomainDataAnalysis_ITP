		<content>{RELIGION}THE PILGRIM MOVEMENT         
 ORIGINATED IN RECTORY AND CHURCH OF   
 BABWORTH(NEAR RETFORD),WHERE RICHARD  
 CLIFTON BECAME PARSON IN 1586.WILLIAM 
 BREWSTER AND WILLIAM BRADFORD WHO WERE
 BOTH PASSENGERS ON THE MAYFLOWER WERE 
 OFTEN IN THE CONGREGATION.THE CHURCH  
 IS SET IN BEAUTIFUL COUNTRYSIDE  NORTH
 OF THE A620 RETFORD-WORKSOP ROAD,ABOUT
 ONE MILE WEST OF RETFORD.CLIFTON WAS  
 THE MAN WHO LED THE PILGRIM FATHERS   
 FIRST TO HOLLAND AND THEN TO AMERICA  
 IN 1620.THE CHURCH IS SURROUNDED BY   
 WOODLAND WITH MANY LITTLE PATHS       
 RUNNING THROUGH THEM.THE CHURCH IS    
 SMALL AND BUILT OF GREY STONE.        
  THE AREA WE NOW KNOW AS BASSETLAW    
 PROBABLY SUPPLIED THE ARCHITECTURAL   
 TRADITION WHICH INSPIRED THE COLONISTS
 IN THEIR FIRST ATTEMPTS AT BUILDING IN
 NEW ENGLAND.
