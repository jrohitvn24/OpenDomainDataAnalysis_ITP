		<content>{HABITAT.}Deciduous &amp; conifer woodlands
 as well as heathland &amp; bogland. There 
 is also some arable land in the area, 
 mostly near farms &amp; houses.           
{POLLUTION.}The area is largely free   
 from the use of toxic chemicals. This 
 has assisted healthy plant &amp; wild life
 The FC has embarked on a programme to 
 protect the Forest against damage by  
 too many people, cars &amp; campers. 5 car
 parks &amp; 1 camping site are provided in
 this area.Vehicular access to parts of
 the Forest is prevented by barriers,  
 ditches &amp; short wooden posts. There is
 a litter problem which is nationwide. 
 There is also concern about the number
 of visitors to the Forest.            
{FOOTPATHS}In addition to the many     
 paths &amp; tracks on FC land there are 9 
 public footpaths in the area.
