		<content>  Trenode school  was built in 1872 by 
 Rev. James Buller Kitson.It has a high
 roof which is unique in Cornwall. No  
 false ceiling is allowed so heating is
 difficult and expensive.The chancel   
 has been opened out to give more      
 classroom space .The main building    
 also has a kitchen and infant room    
 which is also used as a dining        
 room.Trenode has an Elliott classroom 
 for 1st and 2nd years.The P.T.A.      
 bought and equipped a caravan for use 
 as a staffroom, office and teaching   
 area.It has been in use for 3 terms   
 and made a tremendous difference      
 keeping steady continuity of teaching.
