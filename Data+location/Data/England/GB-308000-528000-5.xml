		<content> We are Roman Catholics and we go to   
{St Joseph's Roman Catholic Church}in  
 Cockermouth. Our Church is quite a big
 one. It can fit about 3 or 4 hundred  
 in it. At the back of the Church there
 is a choir stall. It is next to the   
 organ. At the side of the church there
 is a coffee room and thats where      
 people sometimes go and have some     
 coffee after mass. On the side of the 
 walls in the Church there are paint-  
 ings of Jesus and how he was crucified
 on the cross. By the stained glass    
 windows there are statues of Mary and 
 Joseph. The place where you get bapti-
 sed is covered with iron bars with    
 patterns on.Our Vicar is{Father       
{Mc'Gough}and he lives next door to the
 Church. Three masses are held on      
 Sunday, one is at 8.30am, another is  
 at 10.30am and the last is at 7.30pm  
 at night.                             </content>
