		<title>06The Opticians,Tiptree</title>
		<content> We went to the opticians in the       
 shopping precinct.This is in Church   
 Road,between Maldon Road and Factory  
 Hill, in Tiptree and was built in the 
 1960s. There we interviewed a lady of 
 about 37. It was{Don Tylers}opticians.
 We asked her if she minded us asking  
 her a few questions. We got very      
 interesting answers.These are the     
 questions and answers. How do you     
 think Tiptree has changed in the last 
 5,10,15 years? I have only lived      
 here for seven years but I have seen  
 several changes_more houses,different 
 shops.  Do you like Tiptree now       
 or before? I don't really know. This  
 was interesting to know. Did you have 
 a job before this one? Yes,in a       
 Playschool.She had a bit of trouble   
 with this one.  Do you like this job  
 or the one you had before? I think I  
 like this job best.                   </content>
