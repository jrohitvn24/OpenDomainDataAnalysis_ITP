		<content> The{jobs}in our time are quite good.  
 There are jobs like accountancy, book 
 keeping, nursing, secretarial work,   
 etc. These get good pay. You need good
 qualifications for these jobs so not  
 many get them. It is a good thing that
 there are places like colleges schools
 and{Youth Training Schemes.           
 Jobs nowadays are hard to find so that
 is why I try to study hard and get    
 good marks in my{exams.}The work I    
 want to do when I leave school is     
{nursing.}First there is Student Nurse 
 and in that you learn as you do your  
 work. If you then pass your exams, you
 can go up to a higher grade and work  
 your way up like that.
