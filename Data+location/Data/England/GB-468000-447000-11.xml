		<title>11Changes in a village.</title>
		<content> Sutton on Derwent remains as in the   
 past a small rural community.In the   
 past nearly everyone in the village   
 was connected with the land.Today only
 a small numbers of people are still   
 directly so involved.Most people      
 nowadays work in other locations and  
 travel out of the village daily.      
   Forty years ago the village was a   
 more self-contained unit than today.  
 People were less reliant upon outside 
 agencies than at present.For          
 example,most households baked their   
 own bread, grew much of their own     
 produce and many had at least a pig   
 and some hens.Today the necessities of
 life are obtained in the same way as  
 in towns-from shops.                  
  Children in the past entertained     
 themselves more than today and did not
 havethe many outside influences       
 available today.                      </content>
