		<title>11A BREWERY IN BURTON</title>
		<content>Page 1 (of 2)                          
   Since 1950 the number of breweries  
in Burton has been reduced  because of 
amalgamations, and Mr.Neame of Marstons
claims that theirs is the only true Bur
ton brewery left, and even in Marstons,
the major shareholder is Whitbreads, a 
brewing giant.                         
   Marstons employ more than 700 people
of whom about 470 are engaged in the   
production side. They have the capacity
to brew more than two million pints a  
week, the pride of their output being  
'Pedigree' bitter, although they make  
their own lagers, mild beers and other 
bitters. Their 'Low-C' low calorie beer
has been very successful, and is sold  
by other breweries, just as Marstons   
sell such well-known products as       
Guinness and Mackesons stouts.         
   They are proud of being a local firm
and do a great deal for the town.      </content>
