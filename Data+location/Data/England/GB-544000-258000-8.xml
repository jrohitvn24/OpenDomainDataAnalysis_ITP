		<content> ON MONDAY 17TH JUNE, DEAN ALLGOOD AND 
 CRAIG CLOSE, TWO PUPILS FROM ARBURY   
 PRIMARY SCHOOL, VISITED MR THURSTON ON
 MIDSUMMER COMMON.                     
 "IT TOOK ABOUT 5 MINUTES TO FIND MR   
 THURSTON.  HE TOLD US HE HAD BEEN     
 TRAVELLING WITH THE FAIR ALL OF HIS   
 LIFE.  HE IS THE FOURTH GENERATION OF 
 HIS FAMILY TO OWN THE FAIR.  HIS GREAT
 GRANDFATHER STARTED WORKING WITH THE  
 FAIR.  THERE ARE ABOUT 40 RIDES IN THE
 FAIR, AND IT TAKES ABOUT 3 DAYS TO SET
 THESE UP WHEN THEY ARRIVE AT A NEW    
 SITE.  MR THURSTON SAID HIS FAVOURITE 
 RIDE WAS THE DODGEMS.  THE FAIR       
 TRAVELS MOSTLY AROUND EAST ANGLIA AND 
 THEY ARE REGULAR VISITORS TO CAMBRIDGE
 FOR THE MIDSUMMER FAIR."
