		<title>15LOPWELL DAM BY BERE FERRERS</title>
		<content>  The way to Lopwell Dam,just a little 
 N.E. of Bere Ferrers,leads through    
 woods where there are remains of      
 silver mining.This was at its height  
 first in Edward I's reign when growth 
 and prosperity was brought to the     
 area-"the most highly organised mining
 community in Southern England for 200 
 years".Ore was smelted in the Tavy    
 Valley later.                         
   Electricity comes from the CEGB     
 which crosses both the Tamar and Tavy 
 on pylons.This is supplemented by     
 electricity produced at Lopwell Dam-  
 11,000 watts in all.The Dam is 300ft  
 long and 10ft high.It is made of      
 rubble rock faced with granite and    
 concrete blocks.Water is drawn off    
 through a 27" concrete pipe which is  
 120yds downstream.There is a new      
 pumping station carefully covered over
 to avoid spoiling fine riverside views</content>
