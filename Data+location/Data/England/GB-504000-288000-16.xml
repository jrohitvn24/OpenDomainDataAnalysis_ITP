		<title>16ASHTON _ CONSERVATION 1</title>
		<content>   Near Ashton village there is a      
 conservation area of about 5OO acres  
 which is part of the land owned by the
 Ashton Wold Estate, the property of   
 the Hon.Mrs Lane. The reserve is      
 made up largely of woodland. There is 
 also a lake and grassland. The        
 woodland is a mixture of deciduous    
 species, some of which date back to   
 the original Domesday period. However,
 most of it was replanted in the mid-  
 1800's. Recently most of the elms were
 lost as a result of Dutch Elm disease 
 in the 1970's. This century the bird  
 population of the area has changed    
 because of general changes in the     
 habitat and surrounding farming       
 methods. Recently over 1OO different  
 species were recorded. Of particular  
 interest were nightjars. nightingales 
 and waxwings.
