		<title>04Wellington 'Phone Exchange</title>
		<content>  The exchange in Wellington was opened
 in 1962 and will close in 1990.There  
 are small local exchanges in Newport, 
 Dawley,Stirchley,Oakengates and       
 Shifnal.                              
  Your phone is  connected to the      
 exchange nearest to your house by a   
 pair of wires called jumpers.         
  Each cable into the exchange can take
 1000 calls.About one hundred thousand 
 calls go through Wellington Exchange  
 each week.Telephone wires are pumped  
 with air to prevent water entering    
 them.                                 
  When a call is connected a           
 uniselector records the number.Every 3
 months photographs of the numbers are 
 taken and the telephone bills are     
 calculated.                           
  STD stands for subscriber trunk      
 dialling.The biggest bill in our area 
 is that of G.K.N Sankey Ltd.          </content>
