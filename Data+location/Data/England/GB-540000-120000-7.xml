		<title>07DAIRY FARMING (NEWICK AREA)</title>
		<content> The most important form of farming in 
 this area is dairy farming. The size  
 of the farm we visited is 1600 acres, 
 of which 450 acres is given over to   
 corn crops (wheat, barley, oats and   
 maize) and peas. The rest is grass,   
 grown for silage.It supports 480      
 dairy cows and 500 other animals (beef
 and young dairy). The silage crop     
 takes 6 weeks from being cut, then    
 fertilized, to being cut again. The   
 grass grown here is mainly Melle (plus
 clover for nitrogen). It is sown in   
 the Autumn and has a life of 5 years. 
 The cattle are Friesans, which are    
 black and white. Their milk, once just
 for local consumption, now goes to    
 Woodgate Dairy, Sheffield Park, to    
 provide milk for a much larger area.  
 Nothing is removed from the milk at   
 the farm and it takes just 2 days to  
 get from cow to doorstep.             </content>
