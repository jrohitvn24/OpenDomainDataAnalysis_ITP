		<title>18THE MODS AND ROCKERS</title>
		<content> During the early 1960's a mass influx 
 of young people roared into Brighton  
 accompanied by screaming scooters and 
 roaring motorbikes.These were the     
 Mods- clean and smart in appearance,  
 trend-setting in the latest fashion   
 clothes,peace-loving and addicted     
 to pop music and the liberty given    
 to them by the scooter - and the      
 Rockers - a group of strong men       
 prone to violence, dressed in heavy   
 leathers who were interested in       
 pushing their machines to the 'ton' as
 a sign of machismo. Consequently      
 the Rockers hated the Mods, regarding 
 them as cissies and attacking them    
 whenever the chance occurred.The media
 reported these as 'seaside battles'   
 and perpetuated this image.The        
 activities of the Mods and Rockers    
 were captured in the film,            
 'Quadrophenia' starring The Who (1970)</content>
