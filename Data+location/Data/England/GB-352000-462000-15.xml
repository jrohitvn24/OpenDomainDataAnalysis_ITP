		<content>The Local History group is unearthing a
great deal of information from members'
attics e.g.one member is collecting    
field names from local farmers for     
comparison with early maps.During the  
summer we have occasional Geology,     
Local History and Sketching field trips
and recently have been given permission
to use Moor Platt grounds for croquet  
and bowls.Twice a year all groups meet 
for a party and we have occasional     
exhibitions of members'work.           
  None of this would have been possible
without the help and encouragement of a
great many people in this very friendly
village.Organisations have helped too  
especially the village magazine "The   
Link" and the Parish Council. Natives  
and Â£off-comers' work well together.   
We make many friends,learn new skills  
and enjoy ourselves.
