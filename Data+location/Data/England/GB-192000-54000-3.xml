		<title>03The (St.Stephen's) Beacon</title>
		<content> The Beacon is a dome-like hill which  
 under different circumstances would   
 doubtless be one of the dominating    
 features of the local landscape. It is
 however now dwarfed by the clay       
 workings around it. A short and easy  
 path to the summit leaves the road    
 from{Foxhole}to{Goonabarn}just after  
 the railway bridge.Formerly the       
 remains of a fortification around the 
 hill were visible.On a clear day both 
 Cornwall's coastlines can be seen.Just
 below the hill in the middle of a     
 meadow to the S.W. can be seen remains
 of an old{tin mine.}Further remains   
 lie by the pits between this field and
 the Beacon.Workers from this mine were
 removing stone from the Beacon summit 
 around 1864 when they discovered a {  
{stone coffin.}Inside were four gallons
 of ashes and a seal bearing the{      
{Masonic arms.}                        </content>
