		<title>10Dairy Farming</title>
		<content> In a typical dairy farm in Cogges they
make silage to feed the cows in winter.
Each cow needs 9 tonnes of silage. It  
ismade by cutting the grass to make hay
This is bundled into a huge ball and   
then stored until winter.              
The farm has a herringbone milking     
parlour which is computerised and can  
work out how much food should be given 
daily to each cow depending on how much
milk she gives. The farmer has to be   
very careful to keep the milk clean.   
The milk is stored in a stainless steel
tank which also cools it quickly.      
 The calves are taken away from their  
mothers as soon as they are born. They 
get their mother's milk for a few days 
and then they feed on cattle nuts and  
milk powder(this is cheaper than giving
them real milk). Every day the milk is 
collected by tanker,bottled by the Milk
Marketing Board for doorstep delivery. </content>
