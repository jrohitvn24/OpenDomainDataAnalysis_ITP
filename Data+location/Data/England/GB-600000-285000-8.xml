		<content>{Flora:}The{landscape}has changed      
 considerably in the last decade due to
 destruction of the hedgerow trees by  
{Dutch Elm}disease.Wayside flowers have
 become less varied owing to the use of
{chemical weedkillers}on the farmland. 
 The common weeds as they were once    
 known have now become popular{garden  
{flowers,}such as poppy, thistles,     
 cow-parsley and herbs like feverfew,  
 basil,dill are grown for{culinary}and 
{medicinal}purposes as they were before
 the advent of modern medicines.       
 The{hedgerow}habitats are gradually   
 being destroyed by some farmers whilst
 others are replanting trees to        
{replenish}the timber stock.This area  
 is on the edge of the vast{Thetford   
{Forest.}In the North East corner is an
 area of{Fen}and{peat}which is used for
 fuel.
