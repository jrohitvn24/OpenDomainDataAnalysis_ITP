 at 6.00am and arrived at 10.02 at     
 Hartland Point.We walked into a large 
 field where we saw a fuel tanker and  
 two people sitting in chairs.There was
 a rope all around the tanker. We      
 carried our luggage to where the      
 people were sitting.They told us to   
 keep well back.The lady showed us how 
 to use the life jackets.              
 When the helicopter landed she called 
 someone to sit in the front and then  
 three others went in the back.We went 
 straight up in the air and over the   
 rocks,gradually we got further over   
 the sea and Lundy came in sight. The  
 pilot was looking around at all these 
 instruments.                          
 At first I saw the S.W.Point of the   
 island,Rat Island came in sight,then  
 Mouse Island,Black Rock and Shutter   
 Point.Finally....    (continued)      </content>
