		<title>01N.E.FLEETWOOD and KNOTT END.</title>
		<content>    This area includes Fleetwood       
 container port and the village of     
 Knott End-on-Sea, bounded to the north
 west by Fleetwood's North Wharf and to
 the north east by Preesall Sands,     
 while its south west boundary lies in 
 the residential area to the east of   
 Fleetwood Golf Links and its south    
 eastern boundary looks eastwards to   
 the five small lakes of south west    
 Preesall.                             
    The River Wyre separates Fleetwood 
 town from Knott End village, and as   
 the ferry carries people but not cars,
 Fleetwood drivers have to travel      
 through Thornton and across the Shard 
 Toll Bridge to reach Knott End via    
 Hambleton and Stalmine.               
    Both places are sea-side resorts,  
 but Fleetwood is linked to industry   
 whereas Knott End-on-Sea is linked to 
 farming.                              </content>
