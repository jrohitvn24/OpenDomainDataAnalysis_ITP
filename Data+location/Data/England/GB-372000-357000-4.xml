		<title>04The Trent and Mersey Canal</title>
		<content> The Trent and Mersey Canal ran from   
{Middlewich}towards{Stoke-on-Trent}    
 through Wheelock.{James Brindley}had  
 already built some Canals but he had a
 dream of joining rivers and Canals    
 together so they could run into the   
 sea.The Trent and Mersey was first    
 named{The Grand Trunk Canal}and was   
 opened in 1777.                       
 Industries in other areas were pleased
 because the boats carried materials   
 like brewing at Burton-on-Trent,salt  
 at Middlewich and Sandbach and North  
 Staffordshire coal mining.The business
 was taken over by the North           
 Staffordshire Railway.It is still used
 to carry China but is mostly used for 
 leisure.Some people sail in small     
 cruisers,but most use converted Canal 
 boats.People fish along side the Canal
 for carp and roach.
