		<content> The rectangle which we have surveyed  
 lies west of{Normans' Bay}and extends 
 north of{Pevensey,}the landing site of
{William the Conqueror.}The area is    
 very sparsely populated. There are two
 farms north and south of the western  
 side and a little modern development  
 in the south-eastern side. Two main   
 roads run from{Pevensey}to the north  
 and north-east, and there are also two
 subsidiary roads. The area is flat{   
{grassland}with few trees and          
 criss-crossed by man-made dykes and   
 irrigation channels to aid drainage.  
 To the north we can see the hills     
 where{Wartling}stands. In C340 A.D.   
 this whole area lay under the sea with
{Chilley}as an island, in fact ships   
 came up to{Pevensey Castle.}The       
 medieval village of{Northeye,}which no
 longer exists, was an island, there   
 are also many sites of{saltworks.     </content>
