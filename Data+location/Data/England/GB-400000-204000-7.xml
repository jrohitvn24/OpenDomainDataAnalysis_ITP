		<title>07PERROTT'S BROOK FARM.</title>
		<content>   Perrott's Brook Farm is a dairy farm
 covering 155 acres and is owned by    
{Lord Bathurst.}The present tenant is  
 Sir John Langman.                     
    It takes 3 minutes to milk 1 cow   
 and 1.5 hours to milk all 80 Jersey   
 cows. The milk then goes into a       
 refrigerated tank which holds 260     
 gallons. The farm is well known for   
 making yoghurt. The milk is heated to 
 a temperature of 82c to eliminate the 
 germs.It takes 2.5 hours to curdle    
 then various fruit flavours are mixed 
 in. The yoghurt is sold all over the  
 South of England including{Harrods.   
     The cows eat kale,hay or special  
 animal food in the winter. They are   
 worth Â£400 each. Female calves are    
 kept as part of the milking herd. Sir 
 John has no heir so the farm will     
 return to Lord Bathurst when he       
 retires.                              </content>
