		<title>01A RURAL RETREAT</title>
		<content> This Domesday block is a rural area   
 with three commuter villages;         
 Collingham, East Keswick,Linton.The   
 area is divided by the River Wharfe   
 which flows west to east.The Barsdey- 
 Collingham Beck flows into the Wharfe 
 creating in all two shallow valleys to
 meet in Collingham.Two roads follow   
 these valleys to meet in Collingham   
 .The A58 Leeds-Wetherby road is the   
 main artery through the block.The     
 Crossgates-Wetherby railway passed    
 through Collingham and East Keswick   
 until its closure in 1965.The highest 
 point is in the south of the area     
 about 350 feet above sea level.The    
 view from here is of pleasant well    
 managed farm land dotted with housing 
 estates.This is a rural retreat to the
 east of the West Yorkshire conurbation
 of Leeds and Bradford.The living is   
 clean.                                </content>
