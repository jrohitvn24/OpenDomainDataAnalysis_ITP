		<content> The shops are very different to those 
 of fifty years ago. The{village store 
 and{bakery,}run by Mrs Playle and her 
 five sons, was where Herrings Way and 
 Ponders Road now meet. Bread was made 
 daily and delivered on Mondays,       
 Wednesdays and Thursdays. On Saturday 
 nights people often paid{one penny}to 
 put meat or a cake in the baker's oven
 to cook. There is no bakery now and   
 the present shop is where a very small
 shop used to be fifty years ago.      
 Almost everything was sold in the     
 shop, including{boots,}and food       
 like butter and sugar had to be bagged
 and weighed.                          
 The{post}was delivered by two people, 
 one lady on foot, covering the West of
 the village, and one man on his       
 bicycle, to do the rest. Now we have a
 man on a scooter.{Milk}kept in churns 
 was delivered daily by horse and cart.</content>
