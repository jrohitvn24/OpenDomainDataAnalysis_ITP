		<title>20MY SATURDAY</title>
		<content>   This is a usual Saturday for me.I   
 wake up at about 9.30 am. I get out of
 bed and go down stairs. I have a bowl 
 of weetabix cereal for{breakfast.}Then
 I watch{television.}I usually watch   
 Scooby Doo (cartoon series). Sometimes
 in the morning, if the weather is     
 pleasant, I play tennis with my Father
 on Winchester College grass courts.   
 Later I go to get our weekly bread    
 from the bakers at St.Cross. Sometimes
 I go to Eastleigh, usually to buy some
 sports gear. If I don't go shopping   
 I go to my friend's house to play     
 football, practise athletics or listen
 to pop records. When I get back I have
 some{supper,}which is usually pasta,  
 and a cup of tea. I put the radio on  
 so I can listen to some music. Then I 
 watch horror films until 11.00 pm.    
 which is when I go to bed.
