		<title>09LONGHOPE VILLAGE</title>
		<content> 1To find out about Longhope we        
 interviewed{Ian Cameron}at the{Post   
{Office}. He is the chairman of the {  
{Parish Council}and of several other   
 committees. He was born in the village
 and used to grow plums. His family is 
 still involved in this work. The      
 village is lively and enterprising. It
 offers employment as well as          
 accomodating commuters. There are 2   
 schools in the village, churches and a
 lively community spirit. There is a   
{recreation ground}which was bought by 
 public subscription as a war memorial.
 The annual fete pays for its upkeep.  
 It has never been a charge on the     
 rates. There is a{parish charity,  }  
 dating at least back to 1760(vestry   
 fire destroyed prior records). This   
 now takes the form of cheques for old 
 people to pay for winter heating.
