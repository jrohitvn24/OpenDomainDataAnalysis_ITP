 On entering Frolesworth, a village of 
 walls, a doorway on the left leads    
 into The Square. Here there are 16    
 Almshouses built by Right Hon. John   
 Smith in 1725. They form the three    
 sides of a rectangle around a         
 beautiful well keep garden with old   
 water pump in the middle. Incorporated
 in The Square is the private chapel   
 for the almshouses.                   
 Blacksmith - still in operation       
 Plough &amp; Harrow Inn - the car park on 
 the left-hand side was the site of the
 village school.                       
 St. Nicholas' Church commands a very  
 high point with good views across the 
 surrounding area.
