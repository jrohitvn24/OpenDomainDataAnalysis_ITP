 To play{Snake It}first choose  'It'.  
 The players then spread out and 'It'  
 chases them. When 'It' catches a      
 player the player and 'It' hold hands.
 These two chase the other players     
 until another is caught and joins the 
 chain. This continues until the chain 
 is complete. The game starts again and
 the person that was caught first is   
 'It'.                                 
 To play{One Knee Catch}stand in a     
 circle. One player throws the ball to 
 another player who if he catches it   
 throws it to someone else. If a player
 drops a ball he goes down on one knee.
 If he fails to catch the next ball he 
 goes down on two knees. The next time 
 he uses one hand and then he is out.  
 If he catches a ball he returns to his
 last condition. Other games include   
 football, rounders,cricket &amp; whippet. </content>
