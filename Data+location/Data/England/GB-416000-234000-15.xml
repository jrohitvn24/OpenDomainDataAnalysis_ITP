		<content> The librarian of Blockley chose to be 
 a librarian because she  used to like 
 books.                                
       A librarian has to be clean neat
 and tidy . She also thinks  one needs 
 to be freindly .                      
       She has to get up in relation   
 with the library at about 7.oo am. so 
 that she is ready in time to open it. 
       She likes Blockley because it is
 small. She is not a qualified         
 librarian.                            
       To be a qualified librarian     
 there are some exams that have to be  
 sat.                                  
       The library is housed under the 
 British Legion in Blockley.
