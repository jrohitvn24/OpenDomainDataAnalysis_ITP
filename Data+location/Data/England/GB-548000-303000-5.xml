 The shields show the Fincham Arms. The
 ancient Piscina in the wall of the    
 chapel was used to wash the linen &amp;   
 the cups. The latten Lectern held     
 music for the choir boys it was made  
 before brass was invented. The Alms   
 Box is a funny looking box which is   
 probably unique in England. It stands 
 in the South  Aisle Chapel. The alms  
 box is very old and was used for      
 collecting money from women at the    
 church. The money was dropped in      
 different openings according to       
 whether the child was male,female or  
 if the lady had twins.There is also a 
 door to obtain access to the          
 contents.There is an interesting room 
 called a parvis above the entrance    
 porch which was used as a school room 
 &amp; a guest room for visiting Clergymen.
