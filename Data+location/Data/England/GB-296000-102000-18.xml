		<content>{ Bradninch}has many surrounding{farms.
 We chose several, among them being    
 Hele Payne and Caseberry. Most of Hele
 Payne is crop land. We saw ploughed   
 fields and one with mustard in it.The 
 farm has 242 acres with 15 fields.    
 Crops grown include{cereals,}oil seed,
 rape and forage maize. Some are       
 permanent pasture. Animals include 1  
 cow,400 fattening pigs and 190 sheep. 
  There are 4 tractors and a combine   
 harvester. The house roof dates from  
 medieval times.                       
  Both Mr. Shere at Caseberry and Mr.  
 Selway at Moorland  were very         
 helpful.Mr. Shere owns 209 acres and  
 has 101 cattle. Ian Selway attends our
 school as have his sisters.He hopes to
 follow the family farming tradition.  
{ The Mayor of Bradninch}visited school
 and explained how husbandry worked.
