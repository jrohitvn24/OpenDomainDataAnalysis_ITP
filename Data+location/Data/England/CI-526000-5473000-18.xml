 Throughout history, agriculture has   
 been an important part of the         
 Guernseyman's life.                   
 Before the Elizabethan Age production 
 was mainly on a subsistence level and 
 the 'Cottage ' industry was the most  
 important source of income on the     
 island.                               
 During the nineteenth century,        
 vineries began to appear. Grapes were 
 the main crop, also melons and figs   
 were grown on a lesser scale.         
 Agricultural production soared and in 
 1890 a new crop was intoduced,        
 Tomatoes. These wrre grown outside and
 did not become the main crop of       
 Guernsey until just before the Second 
 World War, when  glasshouses sprung up
 ,overnight.                           
                                       </content>
