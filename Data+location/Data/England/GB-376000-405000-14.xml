		<title>14FACILITIES IN RINGLEY</title>
		<content>{RINGLEY}IS ONLY A SMALL VILLAGE AND   
 HAS VERY FEW{FACILITIES.}             
 IT HAS ONLY ONE SHOP,WHICH SELLS      
 GENERAL GROCERIES AND MOST PEOPLE     
 TRAVEL TO{FARNWORTH}OR{RADCLIFFE}TO DO
 THEIR WEEKLY SHOPPING.                
 THE NEAREST{DOCTOR}AND{CHEMIST}IS JUST
 OVER A{MILE}AWAY.                     
 THERE IS NO BUS SERVICE ACTUALLY IN   
 THE VILLAGE ALTHOUGH THERE IS ONE ON  
 THE MAIN ROAD NEARBY.                 
 A{MOBILE LIBRARY}AND{MOBILE           
{GREENGROCER }BOTH VISIT THE VILLAGE.  
 THE NEAREST{SPORTS CENTRE}IS SEVERAL  
 MILES AWAY,AND{RESIDENTS}HAVE TO GO TO
 FARNWORTH OR RADCLIFFE TO SWIM.       
 DESPITE THIS LACK OF{AMENITIES}THE    
 VILLAGERS DO NOT REALLY WANT ANY      
 CHANGE AS THEY BELIEVE THAT THIS WOULD
 SPOIL THE CHARACTER OF{RINGLEY.}      
 YOUNGER{ONES}WOULD LIKE MORE          
 FACILITIES FOR CHILDREN.              </content>
