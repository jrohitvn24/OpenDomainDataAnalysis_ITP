		<title>08WALESBY CHURCH AND CHAPEL</title>
		<content> The church in Walesby is named after  
 St. Edmund. The original Saxon        
 building was built from wattle and    
 daube. The present church is built out
 of stone. The coats of arms of the    
 Bamington and Stone families can be   
 seen on a panel in the tower wall, the
 arms being a lion and baboon. On the  
 North side of the church there is a   
 leper squint, a window used by lepers 
 in years gone by so that they could   
 join in Sunday mass. The original     
 Saxon font, the oldest thing in the   
 village, is now outside because it was
 replaced by a Norman example.         
 The Methodist Chapel in the village   
 was built of traditional brick        
 design at the end of the last century.
