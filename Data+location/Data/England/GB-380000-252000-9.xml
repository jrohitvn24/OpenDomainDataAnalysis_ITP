		<content> One of our oldest inhabitants Mr.     
 Chalke who has lived in the village   
 for fifty years came and told us about
 what it used to be like.He used to be 
 the postman.In 1932 Rushwick was 3    
 hamlets which gradually grew until    
 they joined together to become one    
 village.                              
 The only transport was by train.There 
 was no bus service.                   
 As the roads had so little traffic it 
 was safe to play in the road &amp; one of 
 the games the children played was tip 
 an cap.                               
 Rushwick School was built in 1964.It  
 had originally been at Crown East but 
 was moved to the village.It had only  
 two new classrooms,a hall &amp; a library.
 Mr. Chalke has seen a great many      
 changes in our village in fifty years.
