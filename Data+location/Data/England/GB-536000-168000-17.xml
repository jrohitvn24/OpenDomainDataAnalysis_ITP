		<title>17Development of Beckenham</title>
		<content> This area originally consisted of a   
 number of manors, their adjoining     
 farmland, and woodlands. Although most
 of these old manors have now          
 disappeared, their names are          
 perpetuated in local street names,eg  
 Foxgrove Road. There was a village    
 near the church of St. George's,      
 Beckenham.                            
   The building of the railway led to a
 great increase in house and road      
 building and to the major development 
 of the area. Early this century       
 further development took place. For   
 example, there were grandiose plans   
 for building a new shopping centre,   
 complete with bandstand and with roads
 in concentric circles round it, in the
 southern part of this block. The First
 World War put an end to most of this  
 scheme, and only the residential      
 area of Park Langley remains of it.   </content>
