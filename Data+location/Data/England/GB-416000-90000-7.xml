		<content> 73% of the adult population in the    
 Mudeford area is retired.(626         
 males,955 females).A limited enquiry  
 showed the following results:-        
 None of the people questioned had     
 lived in Mudeford all their lives and 
 the majority had moved here after     
 1970.Most chose Mudeford because it is
 a beautiful,quiet place with friendly 
 people.The sea and forest proved the  
 other main attractions.Most chose a   
 bungalow,50% own a car,50% rely on the
 bus service which they find adequate. 
 Children carrying out the survey found
 the variety of leisure activities pur 
 sued by retired people interesting.   
 Gardening,music,walking,painting,stamp
 collecting,geneaology.The only        
 improvement suggested was the         
 provision of more public seats and    
 shelters between Mudeford and         
 Christchurch.                         </content>
