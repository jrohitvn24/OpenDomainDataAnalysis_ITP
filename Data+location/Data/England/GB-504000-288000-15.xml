		<title>15ASHTON - A MODEL VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Ashton is situated near to the River  
 Nene and is surrounded by a large     
 amount of agricultural land. The new  
 by-pass is to run near it. The small  
 picturesque cottages were rebuilt in  
 1900 out of stone and were given      
 thatched roofs. They were built for   
{Ashton Estate}workers. Some are now   
 holiday homes which tourists may rent.
 There is a also a pub{'The Chequered  
{Skipper'}and a small chapel which     
 dates back to the 18th century. Many  
 of the 90 inhabitants work on the     
 Ashton Estate. The estate land is not 
 open to the public which is a pity    
 because the countryside is very       
 pleasant. Every year the{World Conker 
{Championships}take place on the       
 village green. This event attracts    
 many visitors. The mill just outside  
 the village also attracts visitors    
 because its is now a{fish-museum.     </content>
