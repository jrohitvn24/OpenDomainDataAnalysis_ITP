		<title>12Totton &amp; Eling Council</title>
		<content> The chairman of the Totton &amp; Eling    
 District Council said that she became 
 a councillor because a boy got killed 
 by a train. She wanted to put up a    
 fence but the railway would not put   
 one up so thats why she became a      
 councillor. She thought the only way  
 get something done was to be a        
 councillor &amp; do something about it    
 yourself.                             
                                       
 She started being a councillor when   
 she was 28 but you can start when     
 you're 18. She had been run over on   
 her way to a safety meeting, crossing 
 on a zebra crossing. The other people 
 at the meeting thought it was amusing.
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
