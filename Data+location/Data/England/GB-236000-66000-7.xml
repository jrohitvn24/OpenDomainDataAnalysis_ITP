		<content>   The{nursery}was established in 1966 
 on the outskirts of St.Dominick. It   
 occupies 9 acres, 2 acres of which are
 under glass.There are 11{greenhouses},
 the largest measuring 50m long by 28m 
 wide. Production is concentrated on   
 cut flowers for the wholesale market. 
 Mr.Rickard, the owner, supplies his   
 two florist shops in Plymouth plus 49 
 others throughout Devon and Cornwall. 
   Strains of Alstromeria, a S.American
{flower}which requires no heat and can 
 flower all year round, are the main   
 cash crops. Mr.Rickard needs a special
 licence to grow this plant and his    
 nursery is the only one in the S.W. to
 grow them. He travels to{Holland}to   
 buy the Alstromeria and equipment such
 as leaf strippers and bunching        
 machines A large cold store keeps the 
 cut flowers fresh while they await    
 delivery.                             </content>
