		<content> The East Somerset Railway at Cranmore 
 started its life in 1858 as The East  
 Somerset Railway, but in between has  
 been called{The Great Western Railway,
 and been part of the{Western Region}of
{British Railways.}The station and line
 were closed to passengers in 1963 but 
 by 1973 work was well on the way to   
 building a locomotive shed and opening
 the line to visitors. The{painter}and 
{artist David Shepherd}started all this
 when he decided to make Cranmore the  
  home for his famous{Black Prince and 
{Green Knight locomotives.}Since 1973  
 many new locos,carriages and wagons   
 have arrived and new sections of line 
 have been re_opened. Cranmore Station 
 was opened to passengers again in 1984
 and the line now stretches for about 2
 miles towards Shepton Mallet with     
 three small halts along it.
