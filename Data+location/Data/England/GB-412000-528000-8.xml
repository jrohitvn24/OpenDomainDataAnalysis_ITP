		<content>      Fifty years ago villagers were   
 able to support themselves and provide
 services for others within the commu- 
 nity.  Some who were not employed in  
 local mines or on farms were skilled  
 or semi-skilled craftsmen.  Those who 
 weren't sought seasonal work in the   
 locality, proffered their services as 
 odd-job men, or sold mushrooms,       
 blackberries and crab apples picked   
 from the fields and hedgerows.  Some  
 ladies washed and ironed clothes for  
 others, or worked as servants in the  
 homes of those who had regular work.

 to camp on the High Quarry.  They     
 would vie with Scottish pedlars to    
 sell their cheap wares from door-to-  
 door, whilst itinerant tramps would   
 beg from house-holders known to be
