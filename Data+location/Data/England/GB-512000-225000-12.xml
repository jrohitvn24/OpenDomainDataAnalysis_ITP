		<title>12EDUCATION IN OFFLEY.</title>
		<content>  Offley School was established as long
 ago as 1841, subsequent to the        
 creation of a Trust Fund by Dame Sarah
 Salusbury of Offley Place and the     
 Reverend Lynch Burroughs, Vicar of    
 Offley.  Early this century,          
 responsibility for the maintenance of 
 the educational functions was taken   
 over from the Church by the           
 Hertfordshire County Council and      
 later, in implementation of the 1944  
 Education Act the School was          
 re-organised as a Junior Mixed and    
 Infants School.  The School is now    
 controlled by Governors nominated     
 respectively by the Diocese of St.    
 Albans, Offley Parochial Church       
 Council and Hertfordshire County      
 Council. This year the children from  
 the neighbouring village of Lilley,   
 their own school having closed, became
 pupils of Offley School.              </content>
