		<title>17Maypole dancing at Ridgeway</title>
		<content>   Mrs. Jackson helped us to learn     
 Maypole dancing. We began with the{   
{"Circle Dance"}in which we had an     
 outer and an inner ring. The outer    
 ring danced followed by the inner. It 
 was hard to keep in time.             
   In the{"Rope Dance"}3 people danced 
 round a kneeling person, their braids 
 twisted round the kneeler's braid.    
   The {"Spider's Web"}was made by     
 weaving in and out of radiating braids
 to make a criss-cross shape.          
  {"Single and Double Plaiting"}was    
 very hard as we had to weave to the   
 right and left of each other. We made 
 a lovely plait on the pole.           
   The{"Liberty Horse"}dance was       
 easier. Four groups made a cross shape
 around the pole and circled in stages,
 moving like horses with high knees.   
   We had great fun.
