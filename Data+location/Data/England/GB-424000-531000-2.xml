		<title>02Life in Middlestone Village.</title>
		<content> On Wednesday we went to{Middlestone   
 Village. We found out lots of         
 information about the village. The    
 population is 57. The{Ship Inn}is the 
 only amenity in the village. There is 
 a small patch of grass with some      
 swings. The village is small and cut  
 off from everything, the nearest shop 
 is in Kirk Merrington. The only bus   
 that comes through the village is the 
{Eden,}but it only comes once an hour. 
 On Sunday it only runs in the         
 afternoon. There are 2 rows of houses 
 in Middlestone, the High Road and the 
 Low Road. There are 2 farms in        
 Middlestone, the{West End Farm}which  
 is owned by Mr. Clark, and the{East   
{Farm}which is owned by Mr.Blacket. We 
 went to East Farm.
