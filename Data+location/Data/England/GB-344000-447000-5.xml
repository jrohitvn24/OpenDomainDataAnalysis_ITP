		<title>05John Wilson-Patten (2)</title>
		<content> By 1870 Colonel Wilson-Patten M.P. was
 resident in Winmarleigh and the       
 improvements started about 1850       
 gathered pace and in a few short years
 he built the School (1870),the Hall   
 (1871),the Church (1876),to which he  
 added a new aisle in 1887 Jubilee     
 Year,and a Vicarage.                  
 Unfotunately both his sons predeceased
 him and his grandson and sole male    
 heir,John Alfred, died at 21 in 1889. 
 Thus Colonel John Wilson-Patten, who  
 was created Baron Winmarleigh in 1874,
 was the First (and last) Lord         
 Winmarleigh.                          
 He died on 11th July 1892,aged 90, at 
 Winmarleigh Hall.Unlike his grandson, 
 who 3 years previously had been buried
 at Winmarleigh,His Lordship was taken 
 to Warrington Parish Church to be     
 buried in the Patten Vault.
