		<content> We have got two{parks}in Leegomery.We 
 have a slide and swings.We play       
 football on a field.There are two     
 trees that look like goalposts.The    
 park is brilliant,there are rocking   
 horses with their heads off and there 
 is a{game}called "Bomb".To play this  
 you need at least four people.You get 
 a football and someone holds the      
 ball;you count backwards from 10 to 1 
 and whoever is holding the ball at 1  
 is out because they are blown up.     
 We also play "spot"and cricket."Spot" 
 is where you kick a ball against a    
 wall and the other person has to kick 
 it back.If you miss the wall you are  
 out.The best way to play is to kick   
 the ball hard so the other person will
 miss
