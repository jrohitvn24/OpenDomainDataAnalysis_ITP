		<title>13STOCKPORT TIP IS NOW AMENITY</title>
		<content>  The South Reddish side of the{Tame}  
{ Valley}was once dominated by the     
{ Asherbottom, Grimesbottom and}       
{ Woodhall}refuse tips. The three tips 
 were  merged and the tipping area     
 increased to 10 hectares by diverting 
 the river. Controlled tipping took    
 place from 1963 onwards and over 1    
 million tonnes of rubbish was dumped. 
  The tip was closed in 1978 as part of
 the{Tame Valley Development Scheme.}  
 Top soil covered the rubbish. As      
 plants took hold the area became a    
 green field. 1985 has seen further    
 landscaping. Trees have been planted  
 to screen the area from the road on   
 the western side. A pond has been dug.
  This valuable amenity area is less   
 then a mile from Stockport centre. You
 would never guess now what lies       
 beneath it.
