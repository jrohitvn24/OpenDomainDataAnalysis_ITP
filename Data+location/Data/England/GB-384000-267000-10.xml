 One of the  features of  this part of 
 the  area  is  the   amalgamation  of 
 fields , even  since the  last survey 
 in 1978. The farmers want to increase 
 field size for economy of working and 
 to minimise unusable areas.           
                                       
 Those  concerned  with {conservation ,
 however, think otherwise.             
                                       
 Also there  are attempts to divert and
 sometimes  close  footpaths , some  of
 which  have been there  for centuries.
 Again,the many{ramblers}do not approve
 and  fight  to keep open all rights of
 way.                                  
                                       
 Thankfully, they are winning.         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
