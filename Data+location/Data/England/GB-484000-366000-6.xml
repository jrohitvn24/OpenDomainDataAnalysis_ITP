		<content>   There used to be a large number of  
 shops in the village.There was a      
 cobber's shop,two bakers,a post office
 which sold sweets,a saddler's shop,   
 a butcher's shop and a watch          
 repairers.There was also a black-     
 smiths shop. There were also two      
 Carriers in the village which went to 
 Newark on Wednesday and Lincoln on    
 Friday,and the journey took an hour.  
 There was a wind mill in the village  
 which would grind all locally grown   
 corn .There is no sign of it at all   
 now.Just the name of a farm called    
 Mill House Farm on the outskirts of   
 the village.In the village today there
 are three shops.The post office which 
 still sells sweets,but also sells toys
 cards,stationery and wool.The other   
 two are general stores.They sell      
 groceries,sweets,meat,home made cakes,
 vegetables,fruit and frozen goods.    </content>
