		<content>{Preparing for school-}I get up at     
 around 7.30am,my duvet half way down  
 my bed.I discover that it is Thursday,
 the time is 7.40am.                   
 Eventually I am forced to get dressed 
 and I rush downstairs.I switch on the 
 T.V only to see Anne Diamond and Nick 
 on T.V AM. Down comes my Mum from     
 upstairs. I pour out my cereal and eat
 it up quickly.I brush my teeth and get
 into the car. We get to school and,my 
 Mum drops me off outside the school   
 gates.                                
  When I got home it was about 4.02pm. 
 My Mum reminds me I have swimming at  
 4.30 pm.I rush up stairs,get my       
 swimming bag from my wardrobe.I rush  
 downstairs and pick up my joining     
 card.I jump into the car and my Mum   
 drives me and my brother over to      
 Holbrook Recreation Centre.Later I    
 went to Woodcraft. Bed at 9.15pm.     </content>
