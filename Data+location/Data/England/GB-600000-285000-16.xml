		<content> There used to be a{Policeman}stationed
 in the village of Kenninghall up until
 about two years ago.With cut backs    
 etc., the life of the village         
 Policeman has changed dramatically    
 with them having to cover a{larger    
{area}for their beat, anything within a
 30 mile radius.Therefore the village  
 Police stations are not manned all the
 time.                                 
 The nearest Police stations to        
 Kenninghall are{Thetford,}            
 Attleborough or Diss.We are quite well
 endowed with{Prisons,}there is one in 
 Norwich and a new one just opened at  
 Griston.There are also several open   
 remand prisons around the area to deal
 with the less hardened criminal.      
{Community Service}is quite prolific in
 the area, also  we are well endowed   
 with our Probation Officers.
