 The Rossendale Free Press was         
 established on 10th March 1883 and for
 over 100 years has been based at its  
 present site in Bank Street,          
 Rawtenstall. Although called the Free 
 Press it has never been free of cost. 
 It was called the Free Press because  
 its columns were supposedly open to   
 all shades of opinion.                
 The Free Press is owned by the        
 Rochdale Observer Group and is        
 published in Rochdale. It costs       
 eighteen pence and is on sale each    
 Saturday throughout the Rossendale    
 Valley. News articles concentrate on  
 all items of local concern.           
 Photographs accompany many of the main
 stories and there are sections devoted
 to advertisements, entertainment,     
 sport, childrens activities, births,  
 deaths and weddings.                  </content>
