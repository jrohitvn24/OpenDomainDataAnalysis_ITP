		<content> Schools have changed.In my day we had 
 slates to write on &amp; you got the stick
 if you had dirty boots.I had to share 
 my clothes with my brothers &amp; there   
 were plenty of patches.Everyone went  
 home to dinner &amp; walked to school.    
 There was only one car in Chapel.My   
 pocket money started at 1d per week.  
 Later I earned 18shillings a week on  
 the railway but you could rent a house
 for half-a-crown.You could buy all you
 needed in Chapel &amp; I think you still  
 can. Chapel was a friendly place &amp; you
 could go out leaving doors &amp; windows  
 open.Now the town is bigger,living    
 standards are better but we have more 
 vandals.I'm looking forward to the    
 bypass which should help chapel to be 
 quiet again.
