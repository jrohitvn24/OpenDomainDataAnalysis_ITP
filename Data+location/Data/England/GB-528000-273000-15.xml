		<title>15Fashion in North St.Ives.</title>
		<content>  THE most fashion conscious age group 
 in St.Ives are the nine year olds to  
 the teenagers.Most people in St.Ives  
 are fashion conscious,but the older   
 age groups are not so interested.     
  The fashion at the moment is quite   
 popular,but also very expensive.      
  There are no fashion shops at the    
 moment in North St.Ives,so you have to
 travel to town or Huntingdon to buy   
 clothes.                              
  In town Sax,a fashion boutique and   
 the market are the only places fashion
 can be bought,but for younger         
 children fashions can be bought in    
 Rascals.                              
  Our surveys show that fashions are   
 mostly worn for disco's and going out.
 Favourite colours for clothes and     
 shoes are white and pastels.          
  Black and white are popular colours  
 for shoes.                            </content>
