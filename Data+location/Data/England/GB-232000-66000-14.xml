		<title>14THE BRIDGE AT NEWBRIDGE</title>
		<content>      Although the present bridge was  
 not built until{1450,}the site has    
 been an important{fording point}over  
 the River Lynher since Neolithic      
 times. In the 11th century it marked  
 the{boundary}between Celtic and Saxon 
 Britain.                              
      The bridge today retains its 15th
 century form, with massive{piers}of   
 granite and moorstone and 4 round     
{arches,}each 12 foot in span. However,
 it was partially rebuilt in{1698}and  
 widened by 5 feet on the southern side
 in{1874. Brackets}remain projecting on
 the northern side of the bridge from  
 the days when a stake net was attached
 for Rillaton Fishery.                 
      Since 1450, Newbridge has seen   
 the passage of the 1st Exeter to Truro
 coach in{1600,}King Charles and his   
 army in{1643}and the 1st Liskeard to  
 Callington mail service in the{1790's.</content>
