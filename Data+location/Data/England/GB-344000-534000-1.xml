		<title>01HUTTON-IN-THE-FOREST</title>
		<content> The mediaeval Forest of Inglewood     
 stretched for 15 miles south from     
 Carlisle on the west side of the river
 Eden.  It was composed of open country
 as well as woodland, and was          
 administered direct by the Crown under
 the Forest Law, serving as a base for 
 the English in their wars against the 
 Scots and providing them with food,   
 and space to assemble, exercise and   
 plan behind the area of conflict.     
                                       
 Hutton was one of the most southerly  
 manors in the Forest and as Lord of   
 the Manor, Lord Inglewood is still    
 charged with the duty of "holding the 
 King's stirrup when he mounts his     
 horse in the Castle of Carlisle".     
                                       
 The present Lord Inglewood is William 
 Morgan Fletcher Vane, 1st Baron       
 Inglewood, born 1909.                 </content>
