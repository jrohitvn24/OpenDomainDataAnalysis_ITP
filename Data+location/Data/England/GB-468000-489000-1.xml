		<title>01Hutton-le-Hole and Gillamoor</title>
		<content> This very beautiful countryside is in 
 the North York Moors National Park.   
 The northern area is mainly heather   
 and moorland. South of this are two   
 valleys,through which,flow the River  
 Dove and Hutton Beck. The high land   
 between them is under cultivation and 
 the valley sides are wooded.Gillamoor,
 a farming community,stands on the     
 limestone plateau to the west. Hutton-
 le-Hole,a beautiful village, lies in a
 small valley.The traditional stone and
 pantiled cottages are built around a  
 large green common, with white wooden 
 fences divided by the beck. Moorland  
 sheep keep every corner of the green  
 closely cropped the whole year. Late  
 summer sees the moors turn purple as  
 the heather begins to flower. All this
 makes the area popular with tourists  
 The Ryedale Folk Museum in Hutton-le- 
 Hole also attracts many visitors.     </content>
