		<content> Mrs Betteridge has lived in           
 Sedgeberrow for 50 years and Mr       
 Betteridge has lived here for 62      
 years.  Mr Betteridge was a thatcher  
 working for someone for 30 shillings a
 week.  He started working on his own  
 in 1936 and some of his thatched      
 houses can still be seen.  There were 
 not many houses when Mr Betteridge    
 came, but there were 2 shops.  In 1940
 the mill was working and there was a  
 bakery.  Not many people had cars but 
 there was a regular bus service into  
 Evesham.  Bread was delivered by a    
 person with a pony and cart and other 
 goods were also brought round to the  
 houses.  Most villagers worked on the 
 land and several had their own        
 smallholdings.
