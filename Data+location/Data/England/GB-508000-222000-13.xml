		<title>13MY HOME</title>
		<content> My home is situated in a              
 semi-residential area in about the    
 middle of Luton. It is halfway down a 
 road. It is near two main roads and is
 a semi-detached house. There are four 
 people in our house and a cat. Our    
 house has a fairly big garden with    
 five trees and a greenhouse. Just     
 beyond the bottom of my garden is a   
 river which flows to London.          
 In my house there is a living/dining  
 room, a toilet, a bathroom, three     
 bedrooms and a kitchen. Around the    
 environment there is not much life, in
 fact it is very boring. The cat tends 
 to destroy all the plants in sight so 
 the place has a messy look about it.  
 In the river there is a lot of oil and
 litter, in fact there nothing else and
 it is a dump. Our front garden is     
 sheltered from the view by a hedge,   
 thank God.                            </content>
