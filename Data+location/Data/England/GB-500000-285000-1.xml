		<title>01STOKE DOYLE BLOCK SUMMARY.</title>
		<content> The Stoke Doyle block is south_west   
 of{Oundle},north of Wadenhoe and west 
 of the River Nene. There is only one  
 village in this block and it is mainly
 used by arable farmers. The main      
 leisure activities in the Stoke Doyle 
 block are The Golf Course and{Barnwell
{Country Picnic Park}, although both   
 are nearer to Oundle than they are to 
 Stoke Doyle.{Oundle Marina}could      
 perhaps be counted as a leisure       
 facility, but it houses one of the    
 major international boat building     
 companies in the country,Fairline.    
 The area is mainly agricultural. There
 are three major farms in Stoke Doyle- 
 Howhill, Churchfield and Seven        
 Wells. Also there are two fairly small
 pieces of woodland.
