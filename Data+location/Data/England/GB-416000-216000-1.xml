		<title>01Windrush Valley Near Clapton</title>
		<content> The river Windrush, here some 25feet  
 wide, meanders through farmland,      
 eventually to join the Thames. There  
 is private fishing for trout.         
 Kingfishers,swans, coot and other     
 wildfowl are to be seen. Agriculture  
 and related occupations form the major
 activities. There is no industry. Land
 cover is mostly arable (mainly wheat  
 and barley) and managed grassland.    
 several small dairy herds but mostly  
 store cattle. Small flocks of sheep   
 are kept by two of the four farms in  
 Clapton, and byothers. Clapton,       
 population about 100 has no amenities 
 except church and post office and a   
 once weekly bus. No shop, no school,  
 it has electricity and mains water but
 no mains drainage. Great Rissington,  
 considerably larger, has a school, an 
 inn, a dily bus service to Bourto on  
 the water. But no shop                </content>
