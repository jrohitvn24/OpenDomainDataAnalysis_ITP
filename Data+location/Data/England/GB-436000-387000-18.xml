		<title>18MUSLIM COMMUNITY:Sheffield</title>
		<content>   There is a large Muslim community in
 east Sheffield, mainly from{Pakistan, 
 and including second and third        
 generation families. There are several
 local mosques, all well attended. Many
 of the children have classes every    
 evening to learn the{Koran}in Arabic. 
 The home is the main place to learn   
 about the Muslim religion (Islam) and 
 also to speak Punjabi or Urdu, not    
 widely taught in local schools yet.   
   There are{Halal butchers,}who sell  
 meat killed in the Islamic manner, and
 grocers selling a wide variety of     
 spices, unusual vegetables, pulses and
 tinned goods. Many of the restaurants 
 and take-away hot food shops are      
 Pakistani, popular with a wide range  
 of people from inside and outside the 
 area.
