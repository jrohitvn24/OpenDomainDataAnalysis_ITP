		<title>13THE FATE OF SALVINGTON MILL</title>
		<content> This ancient wooden postmill has stood
 on the 106m slopes of Bost Hill since 
 1700 AD.                              
 The mill was active until 1897,       
 following which the buildings became  
 dilapidated.Converted 1907 into tea   
 rooms,and became a popular attraction 
 for the numerous visitors to Worthing.
 Since 1954,the mill has been          
 administered by the Friends of        
 Salvington Mill Society,who,through   
 Sunday openings and fundraising       
 activities,have tried to restore the  
 mill.Unfortunately,Salvington Mill    
 occupies a large attractive site,well 
 served by communications,in a zone    
 ripe for development.Starved of land, 
 the builders of Worthing are eager to 
 develop the site of the mill.
