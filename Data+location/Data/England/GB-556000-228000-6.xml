		<content> Many birds were seen or known to the  
 inhabitants of the area. Swans and    
 other water owl are being encouraged  
 by the restoration of a lake, believed
 to be 1000 years old at the Rookery,  
 east of Horham Hall. The keen eyed    
 observer can see kingfisher, moorhen, 
 doves, fly catchers, willow warblers, 
 magpies, owls, pheasant, partridge and
 kestral; with the more common birds   
 like sparrow, starling blackbirds,    
 thrushes, finches, tits, robins,      
 crows, rooks and wood pigeon. The     
 animal life is of course, more        
 elusive, but there was much evidence  
 of rabbits and bares. Grey squirrels  
 live in the woods and hunting no      
 longer takes place in the area, foxes 
 are increasing in numbers. Other      
 mammals include shrews, field mice,   
 brown rats, weasels and moles. Several
 bats have been observed by the church.</content>
