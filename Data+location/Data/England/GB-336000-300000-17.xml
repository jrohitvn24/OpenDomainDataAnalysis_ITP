		<title>17Local Legends.</title>
		<content> There are many local legends. One     
 tells how Satan decided he would      
 destroy Shrewsbury Town. He searched  
 until he found some large boulders,he 
 put them into his apron and walked to 
 Stiperstones but when he got there his
 apron string broke and the boulders   
 fell to the ground. That's how the    
 Devil's Chair came to be there.       
 There was a rider called Wild Edric   
 who used to ride across Stiperstones. 
 It was said that he married a fairy   
 called Godda.It is also said that if  
 anyone sees him and Godda riding along
 the Stiperstones there is sure to be a
 war. At Hogstow Hall there is said to 
 be the ghost of William Scarlet who   
 committed murder.The ghost is meant to
 appear at midnight on the way to      
 Shelve past Pennerley there used to be
 a gate and if you approach it at      
 midnight it opens automatically.      </content>
