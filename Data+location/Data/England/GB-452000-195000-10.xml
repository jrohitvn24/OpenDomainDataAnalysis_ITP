		<title>10PEOPLE IN CLIFTON HAMPDEN</title>
		<content>   The population  of  the  village of 
 Clifton  Hampden is only about 650. A 
 few  hundred  more people live in the 
 western end of Burcot and there are a 
 number of isolated farms and cottages 
 scattered throughout the area.        
                                       
   It  is  a  very  mixed  population, 
 varying from old people who have lived
 in the village for forty years or more
 to  newcomers, some  foreign, who have
 moved into the area  since JET was set
 up.About 25% of the village population
 is  retired.  Business  people  are   
 increasingly  settling  here,  taking 
 advantage of either Culham  or  Didcot
 railway stations to commute to London.
 The  staff  of the European  School at
 Culham make it a floating, and to some
 extent a multinational, population.
