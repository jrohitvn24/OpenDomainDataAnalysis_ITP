		<content> This block is immediately north-east  
 of Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire.
 It contains parts of the  town of     
 Newark in its south-western corner,   
 together with the near by villages of 
 Coddington and Winthorpe.             
 The area lies in the valley of the    
 River Trent,approximately 20 miles    
 north-east of Nottingham . The A.1    
 trunk{road}crosses the{river}here,and 
 the A.46.(Fosse Way)and A.17.roads    
 both pass through the block as they   
 converge on Newark.The main East Coast
{railway}line from London (King's      
 Cross)to Edinburg traverses the       
 western section of the block.This is  
 predominantly an agricultural         
 area,with some{industry}in the squares
 which cover Newark,and some gravel    
 extraction alongside the River Trent.
