 People visit Southport because of the 
 attractions such as the Flower Show,  
 Model Village and for the             
 entertainments. Another attraction is 
 the beach, although the sea does'nt   
 come in very far, but people come for 
 the fresh air. Another one of         
 Southport's features is Lord Street   
 one of the best for shopping in       
 Britain. There are lots of leisure    
 activities for all generations, and in
 the town centre there are lots of     
 interesting and different shops.      
   People come to Southport and        
 holidays, these people are called     
 'tourists'. Recently there was a brand
 new ride in the fairground  called,   
 'The Looping Star', which has added to
 Southport's crowd pulling facilities.
