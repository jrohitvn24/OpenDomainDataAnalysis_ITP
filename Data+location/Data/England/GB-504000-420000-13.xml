		<title>13CHILDRENS GAMES - BULLDOGS</title>
		<content> BRITISH BULLDOGS is a game that can   
 be played with any number of players  
 but preferably more than six, this is 
 how you play it. You have two markers 
 about 15 metres apart. Then one person
 is chosen to stand in the middle of   
 the markers. All the players line up  
 behind one of the markers. The person 
 in the middle chases one of the other 
 people to try and dodge past him.If he
 is succesful and reaches the other    
 marker the rest of the people try to  
 get past him also.But if he is not    
 succesful,he has to stay in the       
 middle.Then together they chase       
 another person and the game goes on   
 and on until they are all caught.
