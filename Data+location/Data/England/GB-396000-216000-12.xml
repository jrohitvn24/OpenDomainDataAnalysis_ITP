		<title>12VINEYARDS FARM</title>
		<content>  The owner's of Vineyards farm are Mr 
 and Mrs Norman. They have two         
 children. The farm is 240 acres. The  
 farm is predominantly sheep. Barley,  
 wheat and grass is grown. The rotation
 is two years for corn and four to five
 years for grass.  Corn is stored at   
 10% moisture.                         
  Mr Norman starts his lambing from    
 February to March. Last year he had   
 453 lambs; he had to sell 303 of them 
 to the butcher because of the drought 
 for he didn't have enough grass to    
 feed them. With the money he got for  
 the lambs he bought fertiliser to help
 the grass. He now has got five rams.  
  Mr Norman has one Massey Ferguson    
 tractor.  He does not employ any      
 permanent labour but some friends and 
 his wife help him when he needs it    
 especially in the summer.
