		<title>01BERKELEY POWER STATION AREA</title>
		<content> The area around{Berkeley Power Station
 is not only of interest beacause of   
 its{nuclear}power station, but also   
 because it contains the great         
{River Severn}and many other related   
 natural and man-made features.        
 The area is a{flood plain}and so has  
 very fertile soil, which is chiefly   
 used to grow grass for{dairy cattle.  
 This country area has a small number  
 of people, some living on{farms}and   
 others on a{caravan site}which is     
 situated on the outskirts of the      
 nearby town of Berkeley.              
 Apart from{electricity generation}and 
{farming}the other industry in the area
 is centred around an old{flour mill.  
 Recreational activities in the area   
 itself include{mink hunting, fishing, 
 and use of the{power station sports   
{club. }
