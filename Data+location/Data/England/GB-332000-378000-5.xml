		<content>  In our area recreation for the public
 includes Bromborough golfcourse,      
 playing fields and a garden nursery.  
 The name of the nursery is Raby Plant 
 Nurseries.They own 10 acres of land   
 and dont get many customers.          
    We asked 40 children what they     
 liked to do in their leisure time.The 
 best things were T.V.and playing on   
 computers. Here is a list of the games
 and of how many people play them.     
 Bulldogs 16  Polo 1 Swingball 1       
 Hide &amp; Seek 14    Tick 4   Shooting   
 down the lines 4.                     
  The adults in our area liked reading 
  best for indoor leisure &amp; walking    
  best for outdoor leisure.Out of 12   
  adults 11  of them used to go to the 
  cinema when they were young.         
  We found that adults like reading    
 best and computers the worst.It was   
 vice_versa with children.             </content>
