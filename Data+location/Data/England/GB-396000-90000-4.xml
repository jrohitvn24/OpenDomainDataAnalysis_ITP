 This boatyard builds boats and        
 hovercraft which go all over the      
 world.  The boatyard was founded      
 during the war and was modernized in  
 1977 when{RTK}took over.  It covers   
 about 7.5 acres and about 300 boats   
 can be stored there.                  
 About 40 people are employed there.   
 They clean, repair, build and launch  
 boats - it takes about 10 weeks for an
 average sized{boat}to be built,       
 usually from{moulds. }They also make  
 and sell the{Tiger 4 and 12           
{hovercraft. }There is a big workshop, 
 moulding shop and offices.            
 The boats are built for{private,      
{industrial}and{military}purposes.     
 Most are{exported. }Only about 1 in   
 100 stays in Britain.
