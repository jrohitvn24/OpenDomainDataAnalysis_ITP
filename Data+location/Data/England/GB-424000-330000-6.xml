		<content> In Etwall there are many different    
 activities for adults and children.   
 Some of the ones for children are     
 Guides for 1O until 15's, Brownies for
 7 to 1O years old and Rangers for 15  
 and up for girls, and Cubs for 8 'til 
 11 and then you can choose between    
 Cadets and Scouts for boys. There is a
 youth club for boys and girls. There  
 are also activities for adults, there 
 are bowls, cricket and we have tennis 
 courts to play tennis on. In John     
 Port there is a swimming pool which is
 open to the public. There are also    
 night clubs and day classes. Those who
 wish to learn anything, from keep fit 
 to computers, but for things like the 
 theatre, cinema and rollerskating you 
 have take a trip to Burton or Derby.
