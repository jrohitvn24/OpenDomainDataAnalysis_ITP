		<title>01KINGSTON &amp; HAMPTON WICK</title>
		<content> The name of our town is the{Royal     
{Borough of Kingston upon Thames.}     
 It got its name because seven Saxon   
 kings were crowned here. Kingston grew
 up because the bridge was the only    
 place where you could cross the{River 
{Thames}above London Bridge.  Hampton  
{Wick}is just the other side of the    
 river but it is not part of Kingston  
 proper.  It is mainly residential with
 a few shops, most of Hampton Wick is  
 taken up by Bushy Park.  This used to 
 be a Royal hunting park. You could    
 describe{Kingston}as a large town with
 all its shops and roads.The biggest   
 shop is{Bentalls}store. The market    
 place is very busy. There are a lot of
 stalls and lots of busy people buying 
 things. Kingston is famous for the    
 Coronation stone.It stands outside the
 Guildhall, a semi-circular building,  
 where the council meet.               </content>
