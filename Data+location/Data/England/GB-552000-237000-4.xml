 One of the changes which people who   
 live in the town have seen in the last
 twenty years is the way that service  
 industries have increased. There are a
 lot of estate agents in the town.     
 Their offices are in the centre. There
 were two old firms but now there are  
 eight. There are also a lot of        
 building societies. The local society 
 has just opened new offices on the    
 site of the cattle market which closed
 three years ago. There are also the   
 first companies involved in           
 micro-electronics opening up. There is
 a new industrial estate to the west of
 the town. The sites there are company 
 offices and some small works such as  
 glaziers.
