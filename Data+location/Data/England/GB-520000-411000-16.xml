		<content> The only professional craftsmen in the
 village are the joiner and the        
 blacksmith, so most craftwork is only 
 done to modest standards as a         
 hobby.Recently people have had more   
 time for leisure activities because of
 labour-saving equipment in homes, and 
 through unemployment. Both boys and   
 girls at the comprehensive school do  
 metal work, woodwork, pottery and     
 needlework as well as the more basic  
 art subjects. Crafts such as          
 dressmaking and pottery can be learned
 at adult evening classes. Mothers and 
 grandmothers knit for children, and   
 fashion knitting is increasing in     
 popularity. Electronic knitting       
 machines can be used in the home.     
 Sewing machines too are becoming more 
 sophisticated, providing an           
 opportunity to provide more           
 professional results.                 </content>
