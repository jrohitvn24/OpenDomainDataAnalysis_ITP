 friesion cows.He owns 120 acres or 48 
 hectares of land.He has a herring bone
 parlour which milks 16 cows at a      
 time,the jars the milk goes into will 
 hold 32 litres,and when the cow has   
 finished milking the milk goes into a 
 bulk milk tank.The cows are milked    
 morning and night they are milked at  
 6:30 in the morning which takes 2     
 hours and at 4:30 at night which takes
 1.5 hours.The milk is collected once a
 day and taken to Manchester.In the    
 winter the cows are kept in a shed    
 where they lie in cubicles and they   
 can help themselves to silage which   
 Mr.Heath grows.He puts nitrogen  on   
 the grass to make it grow.
