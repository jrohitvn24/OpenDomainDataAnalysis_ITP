		<title>15Buildings in SW.Cheshire.</title>
		<content> Buildings vary considerably in age    
 from the 15th century "Gatehouse" at  
 Saighton to a 1970s house at Hatton   
 Heath.Saighton village is all 19th    
 century &amp; many of the farmhouses are  
 18th or 19th century but are built in 
 a different style being like Saighton 
 of brick but having little decoration.
 Some farms have 3 storeys eg.New      
 Russia Hall,whilst a 17th century     
 house by Golbourne Manor,reputed to be
 haunted by a highwayman,has spy holes 
 in the 1st floor for watching the     
 police beneath.Other properties eg.   
 Hatton Heath post office were built   
 for much poorer people being smaller &amp;
 of only 2 storeys.A fair number of    
 houses have been modernised recently  
 by enlarging them &amp; covering with     
 white painted rendering eg.on Platts  
 Lane.There has been some 20th century 
 building (see page 16).               </content>
