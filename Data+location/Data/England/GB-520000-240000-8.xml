		<content> THE THREE HORSESHOES - Life in the pub
 can be frustrating and hard work but  
 never boring! For the pub to run      
 smoothly we really need to keep to a  
 routine but unfortunately living in   
 the country doesn't go hand in hand   
 with efficiency e.g. when some calves 
 were delivered to a farmer one escaped
 and tried marathon running! What      
 should have been a normal lunchtime   
 with just a few business people and   
 locals enjoying their ploughmans and a
 pint turned into a riot as the locals 
 rushed out to help round up the       
 offender. Even in the bad winter of   
 1981/82 when the village was tempor-  
 arily cut off as snow drifted across  
 the road people fought their way to   
 the pub as if embarking on some great 
 adventure. Everyone crosses our thres-
 hold at some time or other to eat or  
 drink or even to beg or borrow.       </content>
