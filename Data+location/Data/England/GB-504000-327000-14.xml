		<title>14SCHOOLGIRL'S DAY,K.UNDERWOOD</title>
		<content> My name is Hedvig, I am 6 and live in 
 Kirkby Underwood with my parents and  
 two brothers. We have two Jack Russel 
 terrier dogs and a cat named Tina.    
 On schooldays I get up at 7.30, have  
 breakfast and at 8.35 walk to the     
 bottom of our road to catch the taxi  
 for school; the taxi is driven by Mrs.
 Redding, the school secretary.        
 At school Mrs.Lack,our teacher teaches
 us story, picture and maths. before   
 play. After play we have English and  
 sometimes computer, or play in the    
 sand or dress-up using a cot and some 
 dolls. At lunch-time we play skipping 
 games before and after eating our     
 food. In the corner of the classroom  
 is a reading corner with lots of      
 books. I like reading books. Just     
 before we go home Mrs.Lack reads a    
 story.When I get home I play with my  
 brothers before going to bed at 7.30. </content>
