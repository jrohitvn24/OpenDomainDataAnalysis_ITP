		<title>03Housing in Pensilva.</title>
		<content> Pensilva has many different kinds of  
 homes. Several date from the{early    
{mining days}and are made of rough     
 stone with wooden floors/ceilings and 
 slate roofs.Most have been altered to 
 add a bathroom.Others were built about
{1900}for better off people.They used  
 granite blocks for the walls and had  
 larger rooms.Later still,in the{1930's
 some bungalows were built using metal 
 windows and concrete blocks.After the 
 war a council estate was built and    
 then came the bungalow estates.Between
{1968 and 1980}six estates with a total
 of{250 bungalows}were built,using the 
 most modern ideas such as readymade   
 parts,tiled roofs and double glazing. 
 At the same time the District Council 
 built an estate of bungalows for old  
 people with a warden living nearby.
