		<content>    A girl and boy, both aged 10, say  
 what they do out of school.           
                                       
    Every Wednesday night, at 6 o'clock
 I go to the 4th. Thurmaston{Brownies.}
 We learn to do things to help people. 
 We should think of others before      
 ourselves and do a good turn every    
 day. We play lots of games like "Man  
 the Lifeboat" and "Supermarket". We   
 sometimes have a quiz. At the end we  
 sing and have prayers. At half past   
 seven we go home.                     
    My{canoe}is red with white stripes 
 round it and is called a dancer. Each 
 week I have lessons with ten others. I
 have learned capsize drill, stern- and
 bow-rudder,sweep and draw strokes.    
 After five lessons we had a test and I
 passed so now I can now go casual     
 conoeing.
