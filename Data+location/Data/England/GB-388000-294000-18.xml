		<title>18Attitudes People of Penn</title>
		<content>People's attitudes around here are very
pleasant. If you are new they make you 
feel welcome. The people are very      
generous, for example if you want to   
borrow some sugar or some milk you     
could go round next door and ask your  
neighbour and they would give you what 
you want. Some people are very old and 
they need help  so the people who are  
young help the old. There might be the 
odd old man who might have a go at you 
if you play near his house but all the 
rest of the people are nice. Some      
people are not very nice because if you
go up to them and ask them if they     
want you to go to the shops for them or
do anything for them they would say no.
Afterwards they would start moaning    
that no-one does anything for them.    
Everyone else is very nice.
