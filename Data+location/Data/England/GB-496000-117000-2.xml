		<content> One of the three ponds in the area,   
 Chingford, was of concern to the local
 people in the early 1980s when its    
 level was lowered. A channel was dug  
 so that water could pass from         
 Chingford pond to Burton pond without 
 passing over the existing waterfall.  
 The owners, St. Michaels School, were 
 told that this was necessary because  
 the calverts under the footpath were  
 breaking up, and they were unable to  
 meet the high cost of repairs.        
 It has spoilt a picturesque spot, and 
 there is concern for the fish and     
 wildlife due to lack of water.        
 In 1985 major dredging work lasting   
 four months was carried out to Burton 
 pond. Silt was pumped out from the    
 bottom of the pond and deposited in a 
 nearby field where the water could    
 drain back into the pond. Workmen also
 cleared some of the ponds vegetation. </content>
