		<title>11THE FAMILY OF LISA</title>
		<content>There are five people living in the    
house.They are my Mom, Dad, sister, my 
sister's baby and me.The baby is the   
only one younger than I.My sister is   
eighteen years old and married but her 
husband lives with his Mom.No one in   
the house is working. My sister takes  
her baby around the town every day. My 
Mom does the cooking,cleaning and      
washing. My Mom gets up before me but  
Dad stays in bed until 10.30a.m. He    
likes to watch Scrabble and cartoons on
the T.V. but my Mom likes to watch     
Coronation Street and my sister watches
Crossroads. I like to watch anything.My
nephew just lies on the floor or in his
pram,gurgling or eating or sleeping.My 
Dad likes gardening and talking and,   
somtimes, my Mom takes me to the       
cinema. I had a rabbit but he had to   
be put down by the vet. I have no pets 
now.                                   </content>
