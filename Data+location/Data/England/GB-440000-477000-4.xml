		<content>     Four farms in the area have large 
 poultry units, in which chickens and  
 turkeys are intensively reared in     
 broiler houses. One shed holds several
 thousand chickens, which remain in the
 unit for 6_7 weeks. The temperature,  
 air and feed are very carefully       
 controlled.                           
     When the birds reach the required 
 weight, they are sent to a nearby     
 processing factory. The units are then
 cleaned and disinfected by 5 or 6     
 helpers specially brought in for the  
 job. Turkeys are dealt with in a      
 similar way but take a longer period  
 to fatten.                            
     At any one time a farm might be   
 dealing with 76 000 chickens and/or   
 35 000 turkeys.                       
     The poultry industry provides a   
 significant amount of local           
 employment.                           </content>
