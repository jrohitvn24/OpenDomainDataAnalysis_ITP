  The area that we surveyed is split   
 into two main sections.The centre of  
 Norwich and the suburbs.              
  We had to survey twelve square       
 kilometres in all.Some of the main    
 shopping streets are:{St.Stephens     
{Street,Theatre Street and Gentlemans  
{Walk}which is where the biggest open  
 market in Britain is.Our area also    
 includes the two landmarks of Norwich,
 the{Cathedral}and the{castle. }       
 Two of the main industries in Norwich 
 are{Colmans}and{Norwich Union}which   
 owns much land in and around{St       
{Stephens Street.}Norwich's only       
 railway and goods depot is in our area
 too.                                  
 To the South is the residental area.  
 There are about twenty schools here.  
{The River Wensum}runs through the city
 and there are roughly fifty churches. </content>
