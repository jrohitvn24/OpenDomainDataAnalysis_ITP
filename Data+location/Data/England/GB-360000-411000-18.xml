		<title>18LOWER RIVINGTON RESERVOIR</title>
		<content>    An aerial photograph of the block  
 would show the reservoir covering a   
 large area in the north east. It was  
 created in 1847 in a quest for clean  
 drinking water by the health conscious
 Liverpool Corporation.   The natural  
 basin and the hard gritstone hills    
 provided a natural site.              
    Nowadays the natural beauty of the 
 reservoir has lent itself to growing  
 leisure use.One photograph shows the  
 activity of the local sailing school, 
 whilst the fishermen meet at Rivington
 village at the head of the water.     
    On the west bank of the reservoir  
 lies Tan Pits Farm which is the local 
 headquarters of the Conservation      
 Volunteers Trust.They stock a vast,   
 varied nursery at the farm and the    
 fruits of their work can be seen in   
 the plantations of rowan and beech, as
 well as in the reclaimed lakes below. </content>
