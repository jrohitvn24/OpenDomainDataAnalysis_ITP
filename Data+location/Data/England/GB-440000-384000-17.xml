		<title>17ATTITUDES -IDEAL FUTURE HOME</title>
		<content>    My ideal future home would be a    
 farm complete with a thatched roof    
 cottage to be my home. I wouldn't want
 a gigantic home but a nice sized      
 cottage with two or three bedrooms in 
 it. I'd have  an old fashioned        
 kitchen with a stone floor.  In my    
 home I'd like shutters at the windows.
 In the living room I'd have an old    
 wooden rocking chair with a patchwork 
 cushion resting on it.  Ivy and rose  
 plants would grow on the outside of   
 the cottage.  The garden wouldn't be  
 too big - just a nice size to have    
 flowers and a vegetable patch growing 
 up from rich soil. On the farm I'd    
 keep lots of different animals.       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
