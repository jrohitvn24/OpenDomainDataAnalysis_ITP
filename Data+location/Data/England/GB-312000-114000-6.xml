		<content> Culm Pyne Barton mentioned Domesday   
 1087 in Hemyock.Most of the land      
 around Culm Davy was enclosed by 1837,
 the present large farmhouse and       
 buildings date mainly from 1860 when  
 agricultural prosperity was high,     
 peaking about 1870.During all the     
 depressed years the annual tythe      
 payable to the established Church of  
 England parson remained the same.It   
 was a real burden for poor farmers to 
 find actual cash specially during the 
 pre1939 depression. The present owner 
 commenced mixed farming in 1954 on 115
 acres, the annual tythe was Â£25.Queen 
 Anne's Bounty would redeem tythe for  
 10 times its value but Â£250 could not 
 be afforded then. By 1975 all Tythes  
 ceased on payment of 2 years value.   
 Culm Pyne has one employed herdsman.  
 Most Blackdown farms are inherited    
 employing little outside labour.      </content>
