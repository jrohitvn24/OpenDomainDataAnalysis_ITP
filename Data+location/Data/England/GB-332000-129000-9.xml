		<title>09King Alfred</title>
		<content> From 846 to 899 King Alfred was on the
 throne. Alfred was the King who saved 
 England from being conquered by the   
 Vikings. Alfred was defeated many     
 times. Finally he managed to defeat   
 the Vikings.  Alfred was supposed to  
 have burnt some cakes in an old womans
 house while hiding from the Vikings.  
 There is a monument near Athelney farm
 to King Alfred. Alfred was forced to  
 pay the Vikings a large sum of money  
 and in return they agreed to go       
 away. In the year 878 his army        
 defeated the Vikings at Edington and  
 King Guthrum agreed to leave Wessex   
 and also to be baptized into the      
 Christian faith. In Burrow Bridge     
 there is a pub called the King Alfred 
 and inside there is a table called    
 King Alfreds table. It is very old and
 looks wooden.                         
                                       </content>
