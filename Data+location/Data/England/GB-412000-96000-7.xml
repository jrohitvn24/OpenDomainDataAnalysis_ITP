		<content> Mr Laidlaw said it took him five years
 to train as a blacksmith but now he is
 more of a farrier.  His forge is      
 housed in a small barn which has been 
 there for many years.                 
                                       
 The area served by Mr Laidlaw includes
{Christchurch, Ringwood, Corfe Mullen  
 and parts of the{New Forest.}It costs 
{twelve pounds}to shoe a horse and this
 has to be done every six to eight     
 weeks.  The horse can be shoed hot or 
 cold but usually cold because it is   
 easier for Mr Laidlaw to travel to the
 horse than for the horse to be brought
 to Mr Laidlaw.
