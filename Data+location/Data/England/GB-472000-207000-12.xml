		<title>12Resume of Haddenham Shops</title>
		<content> The village of Haddenham is{well      
{served by shops}and it is quite       
 possible to live comfortably without  
 having to go to a bigger town very    
 often.                                
 There are{24 shops, half of which sell
{food. Banks Parade}and the shops at   
{Fort End}are the main shopping centres
 but the others are fairly evenly      
 spread through the village, with only 
 the big, new Sheerstock housing       
 development being a long way to shops.
 When new housing development took     
 place between 1964-71 and 1975-81{no  
{new groups of shops were allowed      
 except for Banks Parade.              
 A study of shopping patterns suggested
 that{a large proportion of shopping is
{done in nearby towns}like Thame or    
 Aylesbury and that extra shopping     
 facilities were unnecessary.
