 Caistor and Ulceby. Including the two 
 other schools, there are approx. 200  
 pupils.The school is for over 5's but 
 Janet Dix is hoping to start teaching 
 under 3's as soon as she can          
 accommodate them.Janet doesn't only do
 ballet but disco, modern dancing and  
 tap.Each lesson costs 75p and most    
 start at around 5.00pm and sometimes  
 for adult dancers at 10.00pm.         
 The Theatre School puts on musicals at
 Christmas,Easter and occassional shows
 that correspond with school holidays. 
 The costumes are made by the          
 parents and the practices are held at 
 the Barbarah Garth Community Centre.
