travellers thought it was the coldest  
bleakest place between London and York.
The Swan hotel was built so that they  
could stop the night.In 1935 it was the
first building in the area to have     
electric light.It is called the Swan   
because the swan is the emblem of the  
Isham family and it belonged to them   
until Sir Gyles Isham  gave it to his  
valet as a reward for being a good     
servant.
