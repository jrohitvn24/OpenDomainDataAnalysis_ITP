		<title>03TEWIN HILL FARM</title>
		<content> There has been a farm at Tewin Hill   
 for 450 years.  The present tenant, Mr
 Davies has been farming the 550 acres 
 for 17 years, but the owner is selling
 up so he will soon have to move to    
 another farm.  He has 150 cows ranging
 from 4 week old calves up to cows of  
 2 years old on the farm. He uses an   
 electric fence to control the grazing 
 areas, which cost Â£1,000.  He employs 
 a man to do the milking who has to get
 up at 5 am.  Mr Davies gets up between
 6 and 7 am. and is never in bed before
 midnight.  The harvest is the busiest 
 time of the year, when they can be up 
 until 1 or 2 in the morning.  We saw  
 the combine harvester which cost      
 Â£45,000.  The farm also has beehives  
 and a goldfish pond.  The farmer has a
 7 year old labrador as a pet.
