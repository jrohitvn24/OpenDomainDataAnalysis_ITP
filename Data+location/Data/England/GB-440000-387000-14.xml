		<title>14CHANGES IN BRINSWORTH</title>
		<content>  {Mr. Bellamy,}our{caretaker}talked to
 us about his memories of Brinsworth.  
  {Brinsworth}was one of the first     
 villages to have{gas lighting. Gas}   
 was piped from{coke ovens.}Mr. Bellamy
 said{tourists}used to come and see the
 lights.                               
   Very few people lived here. Most of 
 the men worked{down the pit}or for the
 railways. The{Railway Sheds}were      
 opened in{1900. Thick smoke}hung over 
 the village on a{Sunday evening}when  
 the engines were being{stoked.}The    
 sheds have gone now and{Barratt's}are 
 building a new estate there. Most of  
 us live on the{White Hill Lane}estate.
 It was started in{1970.}              
{  Mr. Bellamy}said the{dentist}used to
 come to{school}to see to his teeth.   
  {Adele's Mum}showed us a book about {
{Brinsworth}in{Coronation Year 1953.}It
 is very different now.{               </content>
