		<content>   Farms in the area tend to be large  
 arable ones in keeping with East      
 Anglia. The main crops are wheat for  
 milling or feed, barley for malting or
 feed, and a break crop of sugar beet, 
 beans or oil seed rape. Beef cattle   
 are kept on some of the farms to use  
 the cereals. Much of the cereal crop  
 is sold to the EEC to be stored in    
 Intervention Sheds as there is too    
 much on the market.                   
   Chickens grown to about 2kg. are    
 produced on one farm. 15000 day-old   
 chicks are reared and brought to      
 weight in about 7 weeks. 6 batches are
 produced in a year.                   
   There is only one dairy farm. This  
 has 50 fresian cows with 50 followers.
 A penalty of 10p a litre is imposed by
 the Government if the quota of milk is
 exceeded. Cream is produced to use the
 excess milk.                          </content>
