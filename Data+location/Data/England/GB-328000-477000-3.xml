		<content>{  Swarthmoor Hall}is situated on the  
 outskirts of the town. It is the old- 
 est house in the area,built in 1586.  
 It is a large manor house built of    
 stone with a slate roof and mullioned 
 windows with an unusual bay including 
 all three storeys. The original       
 contents of the Hall were dispersed   
 when the{Fell family}left;only the    
 carved oak chest of George Fox,his    
 Journal and bed were recovered. It is 
 now furnished in the style of the 17th
 century,and attracts many visitors.   
  {George Fox,}founder of{Quakerism,   
 first visited the Hall in 1652.He con-
 verted Margaret Fell whose husband,   
 Judge Fell,protected their meetings at
 a time when Quakers were persecuted.  
 After 150 years the family bought it  
 back in 1912,and in 1954 it became the
 property of the Quakers.It is rememb- 
 ered as the birthplace of Quakerism.  </content>
