 The residents of the area are very    
 self-sufficient, and rely to a great  
 extent on the produce of their own    
 gardens. Many of the older inhabitants
 have lived in the parish all their    
 lives, while the younger ones tend to 
 have moved in more recently, and to be
 making conspicuous efforts to improve 
 their properties. This group seems to 
 be more mobile, and houses change     
 hands fairly frequently. They take a  
 keen interest in local affairs, and   
 play a key part in parish council     
 business and on the twinning          
 committee.
