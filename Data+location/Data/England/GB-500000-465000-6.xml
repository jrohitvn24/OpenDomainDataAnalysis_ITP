		<content> Dad tests the corn to see if it is    
 ready. If it is below 17% it is ready 
 and Stan can go and combine a field   
 of barley. We Propcorn it to kill any 
 bugs that are in the corn. About  the 
 10th of{August}the barley is nearly   
 finished now.The rape has been swathed
 about 10 days ago and it is ready now.
 There are 24 acres of rape and it     
 takes 4 days to do because it has to  
 be done going up hill. If you go down 
 hill it hits the reel and falls out of
 the pods. Next comes the wheat. We    
 have 75 acres. The combine harvests   
 the wheat but when it is hot and it is
 below 15% we don't have to dry it. If 
 it is producing 3 tonnes to the acre  
 it is doing very well. We drilled the 
 54 acre field first and the 21 acre   
 field second.
