		<title>15CHURCHILLS FACTORY BLAYDON.</title>
		<content> The company was first established in  
 1865 as a small pioneer importer of   
 American tools. Today it specialises  
 in engineers' tools and machine tools.
 The firm moved to its Blaydon site in 
 1955 from rented premises on the      
 Scotswood Road Newcastle. In 1963 a   
 new Engineering Design and            
 Administration Block was added, and in
 1965 a major factory extension was    
 completed. The development of the     
 micro chip  led to workforce cuts as  
 the demand for machine tools fell.    
 During the 1970's the workforce fell  
 from 1400 to 1000. From 1980 to 1984  
 the workforce fell further to 400. In 
 July 1983 Churchills took over the    
 Alfred Herbert Company and employed a 
 total of 30 people to work for T.I. in
 Blaydon. Today the workforce of T.I.  
 Herbert Churchill in Blaydon is 500.
