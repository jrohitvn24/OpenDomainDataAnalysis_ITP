		<content>    We interviewed 218 people over the 
 age of 11 years to find what they did 
 in their spare time.                  
    The results are as follows:        
{Gardening 51%  Watching Television 52%
{D I Y     27%  Decorating          32%
{Reading   35%  Walking             22%
{Swimming  17%  Belong to a club     4%
{Knitting  15%  Bird  Watching       2%
{Cooking   24%  Going to Pub/Club   22%
{Sewing    17%  Go to Theatre        2%
{Sport     20%  Go to Cinema         1%
{Fishing    6%  Taking part in Sport 3%
{Dancing   19%  Car Mechanics      10% 
{Bingo     10%  Visiting Friends    36%
{Playing a musical instrument        3%
    The Survey showed that over half of
 the people interviewed watch          
 television regularly and worked in    
 their gardens. Because there is no    
 Cinema or Theatre in Spalding may     
 account the low numbers going to them.</content>
