		<title>03KINGSKERSWELL VILLAGE.</title>
		<content> Kingskerswell village is convenient,as
 it is close to the sea and the moors. 
 There are quite a few amenities in the
 village,ranging from Playschool to    
 Whist Drive.We have a fine Playing    
 Field where different sports are      
 played during the year,just wish the  
 drainage was better.We also  have the 
 Downs where you can enjoy a country   
 walk.The Village does not have many   
 shops so most people shop in the      
 larger towns. We have no clothes shops
 only provisions and hair_dressers.We  
 have four Churches,Methodist,United   
 Reformed,Church of England and        
 Catholic.We have a very nice Health   
 Centre and very soon a new Primary    
 School will be opened.On the whole I  
 like the Village and wouldn't like to 
 see too much changed.Maybe a Village  
 Fete once a year where all age groups 
 can go.      By M.Hunter.             </content>
