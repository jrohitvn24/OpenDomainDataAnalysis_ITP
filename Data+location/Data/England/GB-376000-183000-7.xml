		<title>07A HORTON CHILD'S HOBBIES</title>
		<content>   In my spare time I like watching    
 birds, butterflies and woodland       
 creatures.I like to go for a walk in  
 the wood and watch the creatures.     
 Every time I go into the wood I take a
 piece of paper and try to draw it.    
 When I get home I make a chart of all 
 the things I have seen. When I am     
 painting I like trying to match the   
 butterflies' colours. Sometimes I take
 photographs.I like collecting things, 
 mainly shells and little pots and     
 ornaments. I enjoy playing on the     
 recorder or the organ. Sometimes I go 
 to my friend's house to play with our 
 dolls. I also collect dolls. I have   
 some dolls from other countries,      
 some baby dolls and a Cabbage Patch   
 Kid.She has long ginger plaits and a  
 squashed face and she wears a nappy.  
 She was in an advertisement on        
 television.           Alexandra Dando.</content>
