		<title>08HILL FARMING</title>
		<content>  Most of the land in our area is hilly
 and lies about 1000 feet above sea    
 level. As a result,no arable farming  
 is possible,and the only crop is      
 grass.The average size of the farms in
 our area is about 100 acres.          
  Pastoral farming concentrates on     
 sheep and cattle.The cows mainly used 
 are Friesian and the sheep are        
 Gritstone and Cheviot.                
  Most cows are kept in small herds of 
 between 30 and 100 animals,and much of
 the milk they produce is farm-bottled 
 and sold locally as unpasteurised     
 milk.                                 
  Some of the rough grazing on the high
 moor has been taken over by the Army  
 for use as a firing range,and some of 
 the original farmhouses on the lower  
 slopes have now been converted to     
 ordinary homes.
