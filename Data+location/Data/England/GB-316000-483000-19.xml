		<title>19SHOPPING &amp; MOBILE SHOPS</title>
		<content> (See page 12 for details of the survey
 we carried out.) The only shop in our 
 area is the Post Office which is used 
 by over half of the families. The     
 travelling shops may be very          
 important to people living here,      
 especially the 14% who do not own a   
 car. We asked families which of the   
 travelling services they used and the 
 results were as follows: Butcher's van
 28%, Mobile grocers 22%, Vegetable man
 14%, Ice cream van 21%, Fish and chip 
 van 7% and Mobile library 16%, Other  
 services include a Video van, and a   
 Crisp and pop van but these weren't   
 very well used. We have one public    
 house which 27% of families used. We  
 found that Millom, 3 miles away, was  
 used by 91% of the families for most  
 of their shopping. Two families relied
 entirely on the travelling services   
 for their shopping.                   </content>
