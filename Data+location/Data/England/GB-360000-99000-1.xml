		<content> Sydling is situated in a valley and is
 a small village of about 350 people.  
 There is  also a small settlement on  
 Up Sydling farm. There are no         
 factories,  one church, one pub and   
 one  small post office. The village   
 hall is well used and was built in    
 1939. The spring that flows through   
 the village rises at Up Sydling.      
 People have been living in this area  
 since Celtic times. Most of the land  
 is owned by the farmers who keep live 
 stock and grow mostly cereal crops. It
 is not easy land to farm because of   
 the hills.                            
 Until this year Sydling was owned by  
 Winchester  College but now all they  
 have left are small pockets of land   
 and most of all the old barns. These  
 they are selling to builders for      
 developement.
