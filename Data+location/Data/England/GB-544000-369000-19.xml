		<content>  In my house live four people,my      
 brother Carl,my Mum, Dad and me.I have
 a sister who is nineteen and has left 
 home.We have a lot of pets like many  
 of my friends;but some of my pets are 
 unusual.We have an Afghan hound about 
 85 cm.high.We have three cats one of  
 whom has a bad tail at the present.   
 Beside these we have about a dozen    
 birds of prey that my Dad keeps and   
 one he shows.It is a Mountain Hawk    
 Eagle and before he shows it he has to
 train it.                             
  We also have a ferret,a goat and     
 three foxes.                          
  My Dad and I go stockcar racing at   
 Skegness sometimes and he helps his   
 friend build and repair his cars. {
