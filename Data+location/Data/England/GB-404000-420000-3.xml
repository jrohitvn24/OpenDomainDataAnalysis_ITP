		<content> The{road system}follows ancient tracks
 and paths. These are found along the  
 valley bottoms and along the ridges   
 of the hills. They are connected by   
 roads which are often narrow and      
 zigzagging. It is somewhat perturbing 
 to be able to see one's destination   
 from the ridge yet have to travel a   
 considerable way by road to reach it. 
 The area is crisscrossed by footpaths,
 many surviving from ancient times.    
                                       
 During heavy snowfall in{winter}      
 travel is only possible by road and   
 can be extremely difficult. All the   
 most important roads are kept open by 
 constant gritting.{                   
                                       
 It is usual to find the roads being   
 used by herds of{cows}which are       
 travelling between fields and milking 
 parlours.                             </content>
