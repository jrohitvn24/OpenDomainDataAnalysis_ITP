		<title>19Bleak House Pub, Woking.</title>
		<content>  The Bleak House Public House stands  
 almost alone on the Woking to Chertsey
 road. It is about 95 years old and has
 a garden and a large car park. The    
 landlord who is there now has been    
 there for about two and a half years. 
  The pub serves light meals and bar   
 snacks. Beer and lager are the most   
 popular drinks.                       
  The regular customers mainly live in 
 Woking but there is some passing trade
 as the road is very busy. It is mostly
 couples that come to the pub but there
 are a few more men.                   
  Summer is probably the busiest time  
 of year because of the garden and     
 Friday is the busiest day.            
  The pub does small parties at        
 Christmas and New Year.               
  It is open daily from 10.30 to 2.30  
 and again from 5.30 to 11.00pm.
