		<title>18Earthwork at Cattistock</title>
		<content> On the north east side of Cattistock  
 the ground rises sharply to about 600 
 feet to form a feature known as Castle
 Hill.   Although it has not been      
 excavated, there is enough evidence to
 suggest that people were living there 
 from the Early Bronze Age.   At the   
 summit of the hill a four a half acre 
 site is bordered by an irregular oval 
 earth bank with ramped causeways on   
 the north-east and north-west sides.  
 In the enclosure is what is probably a
 damaged bowl barrow, 50 feet in       
 diameter and four feet high.   Outside
 to the north is a steep lynchet and to
 the east are banks and sinkings       
 suggesting cultivation and huts from  
 the later Celtic period.              
 Wraxall also has several large round  
 mounds suggesting the presence of     
 Bronze Age bowl barrows.
