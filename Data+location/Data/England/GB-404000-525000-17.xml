		<content>  The{major sources }of{employment}are 
 farming,building,Glaxo Operations in  
 Barnard Castle,Social Services,       
 Schools,Forestry and Opencast Mining. 
  Builders like to build houses on hard
 ground if possible and use{stone      
 because it does not crumble and lasts 
 longer especially in winter when we   
 have severe frosts.                   
  Before builders put{slates}on they   
 put on{plastic sheeting}so that if a  
 slate falls off there is something    
 underneath to stop it from leaking.   
 After they have put the slates on they
 put{gutters}on the eaves. The gutters 
 are made of{plastic,}the plastic is   
 rounded.They put{drain pipes}on to    
 stop the water falling on the windows.
  There is some{unemployment}especially
 among the male population.{50 to 100  
{years ago}the majority of males were  
 employed in the drift coal mines.     </content>
