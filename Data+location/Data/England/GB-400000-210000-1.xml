		<content>  The area of the survey is sited midwa
between the settlements of Cheltenham  
&amp; Cirencester.This is part of the      
Cotswold limestone escarpent,ranging in
height from 150 to 250m above sea level
The area is drained by the River Churn 
&amp; its tributaries.In ecology the       
western half of the area consists of   
the valley of the Churn in which       
deciduous &amp; coniferous woodland        
occupied a third of the land &amp; a number
of bird &amp; plant species are found.The  
economy of the area is essentially     
based on farming with dairy cattle,    
sheep,cereal &amp; fodder crops            
represented.The landscape &amp; buildings  
are very much part of the Cotswolds eg 
honey coloured limestone used for farm 
buildings cottages etc.Within the area 
there are no village communities,only  
isolated farms &amp; houses.
