		<title>01FARMING</title>
		<content>A large farm in our area has many      
fields which appear to be just grass.  
The farmer said that he relies on the  
grass to feed his sheep and cows. The  
cows are kept in order to produce milk 
Each cow has one calf each year in     
order to keep up the prodution of      
milk. Some calves are kept to replace  
the cows. The farmer also keeps some   
sheep. He specialises in suppling other
farms with rams.                       
The grass grown on half of the fields  
is cut and kept for winter feed.       
The farmer explained the process of    
producing silage. He compared it with  
making jam. The grass is cut and packed
tight and it heats up natuarally This  
allows the lactic bugs to preserve it. 
It is covered with rolls of plastic to 
keep the air out and old tyres are     
placed on top to weigh it down. He     
doesn't make hay as it needs to be dry.</content>
