		<title>20THE TERRITORIAL ARMY</title>
		<content> The Territorial Army has had a branch 
 in Braintree since 1921 and has now   
 roughly 120 members.This branch is    
 part of the Infantry and compliments  
 the branches at Chelmsford and        
 Colchester.                           
  The members are called a Company and 
 are trained in the use of Infantry    
 weapons and map reading.They are      
 taught to  drive army vehichles,      
 to drill march and to respond to dis- 
 pline.                                
 They are a reserve army and wear the  
 uniform of the British Army.The       
 members are paid and it varies        
 according to rank.A private who has   
 just started receives about Â£12.25    
 only if he attends meetings.          
 The Braintree branch does not usually 
 attend local events such as the       
 carnival as it is usually too busy but
 the regular army is represented.      </content>
