common water fowl such as mallard but  
also such rarities as the ruff and     
green shank.The pool areas are also    
abundant with frogs,newts and toads.   
Mammals are also found in the park     
such as stouts,shrews,weasels and      
most abundant hares.                   
     The park is looked after by Park  
Rangers.The job of the Ranger is not to
act like a policeman but to be a       
security service.The Rangers often give
talks and guided tours around the      
parkland.There are always at least two 
rangers on duty at Park Hall Country   
Park.At times the Rangers may be called
upon for maintenance and helping to    
deal with dangers.The main duty of the 
rangers is to protect the wildlife from
the people.
