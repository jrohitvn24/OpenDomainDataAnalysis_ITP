		<content>{The garage started as a bungalow and a
 shed with an old hand operated pump.In
{1961}the present owners began renting 
 the site and after five years they    
 were able to buy the garage.It has    
 remained as a private {family}business
 since{1966}.It has now been modernised
 and now has {five }petrol pumps and{  
{one}diesel pump.                      
 The pumps are re-filled three times a 
 week with the use of{"off set fills"} 
 .This means that the pumps are filled 
 through pipes at the side of the      
 site.Every week the garage receives{  
{28,000}litres of two star petrol,{    
{84,000}litres of four star, and {     
{10,000}litres of diesel.              
 In 1984 {vandals}set fire to paper    
 bins and smashed windows.An alarm     
 system was installed and this has     
 stopped the vandalism.The alarm is    
 sometimes set off by lorries or wind. </content>
