		<title>14ATTITUDES OF FARM WORKER</title>
		<content>   We spoke to a resident who worked in
 Boothby Pagnell on one of it's many   
 farms. He was 60 years old and he had 
 worked for 45 years on the same farm, 
 but he had not always lived in Boothby
 Pagnell. His 2 married daughters      
 worked in the nearest town of Grantham
 but his wife stayed at home and was a 
 housewife. To do the usual shopping of
 food he went to Grantham and for the  
 buying of clothes he went to          
 Nottingham. In the freetime which he  
 got, he and his wife just watched     
 television and relaxed or he read a   
 book which he got from the mobile     
 library. He told us that there were   
 quite a few mobile services including 
 a reliable bus service.               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
