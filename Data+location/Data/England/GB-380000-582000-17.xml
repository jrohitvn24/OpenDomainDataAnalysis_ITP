		<title>17THE UNDER FIVES.</title>
		<content> There are two organisations which     
 cater for the under fives in          
 Bellingham,the play group for over    
 threes,and the toddlers club for the  
 under threes.                         
{Toddlers Club.                        
 The main object of the club is to give
 the youngsters the opportunity to     
 learn to mix,and to form friendship   
 bonds which may last to high school   
 age.They have many toys which they are
 encouraged to use,but they also have  
 the opportunity to look at books.At   
 the moment there are 30 toddlers and  
 18 mothers who participate.           
{Play Group.                           
 The play group has 22 members,one     
 assistant to the leader, and two      
 mothers who help each week.The group  
 has toys and books,but the books are  
 used more actively to encourage the   
 children to learn.                    </content>
