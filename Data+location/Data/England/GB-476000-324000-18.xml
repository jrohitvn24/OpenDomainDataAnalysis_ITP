		<title>18Shooting Range Complaints</title>
		<content> Between Scalford and Wycomb there is{a
{Clay Pigeon Shooting Range}set up     
 about 12 years ago. The local owner   
 has been given a licence for this only
 yearly.Shooting used to take place    
 once a week, but in the last few years
 the range has been used twice a week  
 and for longer hours.                 
   So some of the local people,        
 especially{Wycomb residents,}have been
 trying to have the{range closed down  
 because of the{noise.}At the same time
 The{owner}has been asking for a{longer
{licence}so that he could develop the  
 site for{International matches.  }    
   The argument has caused many        
 quarrels and much unhappiness in the  
 villages.                             
   In May 1985 the{Melton District     
{Council}decided the{range must close, 
 but time given to find a new site, not
 easy after the recent publicity.      </content>
