		<content> Mawnan was primarily an agriciltural  
 community of isolated farms.Houses    
 were built on the crossroads.The      
 village became known as Mawnan Smith  
 after the 4{Blacksmiths}who worked    
 there.Today there is 1 who is         
 semi-retired.The old houses are made  
 of{cob}which is mud,stone and         
 lime.Most of these have been renovated
 few  have thatched roofs.The village  
 expanded,ribbon development mainly of 
{bunglows}spread out from the centre of
 the village.Two{council estates}were  
 built for the local people before and 
 after the war.As land became more     
 expensive estates of bunglows were    
 built.The most recent addition is a   
 large estate of houses, mostly        
 semi-detached, to cater for youger    
 families who are employed in Truro or 
 Falmouth.Most people own their own    
 houses.                               </content>
