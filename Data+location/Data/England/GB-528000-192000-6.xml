		<content> At lunchtime{Southgate}comes to life  
 again with people buying their lunches
 from cafes or the take-away food      
 shops.  Beefburgers, sandwiches and   
 rolls, fish and chips and drinks are  
 available.  Most of these are consumed
 in the streets and the wrappers       
 discarded, making a litter problem.   
 Some adults buy a lunch in the pubs.  
 Between 5pm and 7pm when most people  
 are returning home from work there is 
 a rush for the transport again.  There
 are more cars on the roads and people 
 become impatient.  This is called the 
 rush hour.  The most frequently seen  
 style of home in {Southgate} is the   
 semi_detached house which is          
 owner_occupied, but there are also    
 detached and terraced houses, flats   
 and bungalows.  Some homes are rented.
 It is a well-liked suburb of London   
 but a busy place to shop on Saturdays.</content>
