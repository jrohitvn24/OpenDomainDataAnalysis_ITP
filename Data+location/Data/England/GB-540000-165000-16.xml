		<title>16ONE GIRL'S BUSY LIFE</title>
		<content>   There are many clubs around the     
 area; I go to a dancing school in     
 Bromley North twice a week.  I go     
 there after school on a Thursday by   
 bus. The dance studio is very big: I  
 am in a class with about fifteen other
 girls and we all wear leotards and    
 tights. This dancing is modern or     
 jazz. The school also offers tap and  
 ballet.                               
  I also have guitar and flute lessons.
 This week our school is performing    
 "Joseph and his Amazing Technicolour  
 Dreamcoat", which is a musical. I have
 a main part in this play, which we    
 have been working on for six months.  
 The play is set in Biblical times, but
 has been modernised with jazz music.  
 The play will run for four nights.    
   My friend says she rarely goes to   
 the cinema now but watches videos     
 instead.                              </content>
