The pigs are kept in bacon houses.     
After the sow has been with the boar it
takes four months for the piglets to be
born. After they are born piglets have 
their tails cut to stop them biting    
them and their teeth out to stop them  
biting the sow when they are suckling. 
At three weeks they are moved to the   
weaning house and the sow goes back to 
the boar.The piglets are fed on skimmed
k for the next four or five weeks. They
then moved into the bacon house where  
they are fed on wet meal for a further 
eleven weeks. When they reach 90kg in  
weight they are sold for bacon.
