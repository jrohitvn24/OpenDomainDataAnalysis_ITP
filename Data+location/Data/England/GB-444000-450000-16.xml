   Chris Hall's dog is a small         
 Yorkshire terrier called Scamp. He has
 long furry hair. He eats Pedigree Chum
 and mixer. Scamp has a bath every 2 or
 3 weeks. He lives all over the house, 
 but sleeps on a thick blanket on the  
 landing. Chris and his sister take him
 for walks. He gets lots of exercise.  
   Penny Jaram's stick insect lives in 
 a glass tank. During the day it sits  
 on the lid. She often holds it. It is 
 hermaphrodite, laying about 80 eggs a 
 year. Every morning she removes the   
 eggs. She gives it privet leaves to   
 eat. It goes on holiday with her.     </content>
