		<content> The 31 children in Class 4 conducted a
 survey of their parents' hobbies and  
 interests. None of the parents were   
 involved in any educational pursuits  
 and only 50% participated in any form 
 of organised activity.Most preferred  
 to be doing things on their own or    
 with their families.Walking,jogging   
 and swimming were popular with the    
 energetic.Several parents went riding,
 fishing or iceskating, played darts or
 badminton,went to Yoga .One mum has   
 recently started having tap-dancing   
 lessons.Many mums preferred more      
 conventional hobbies and enjoyed      
 needlework,knitting,crochet and       
 cooking.Making beer and wine, breeding
 animals and tropical fish, playing    
 snooker and darts kept the fathers    
 busy!The parents were involved in a   
 total of 26 different activities.No   
 one seems to have much time for TV!   </content>
