		<content> The buildings in the survey are on the
 whole brick with relatively little new
 property being built in any of the    
 villages.There are few council built  
 houses in Shelton and Thoroton but    
 most houses are privately owned though
 there a few tied cottages for         
 farmworkers.Each village has some     
 farmsteads and Shelton and Flawborough
 have large dwellings ie.halls.As there
 are no resident parsons there are no  
 rectories.The main roofing material   
 are red pantiles though the main      
 exception is blue slate.Until recently
 there was 1 thatched roof at          
 Flawborough but it is now part        
 thatched.In Thoroton there is a       
 dovecote of note it being a circular  
 construction in stone.The only public 
 meeting place is of wooden            
 construction at Kilvington.
