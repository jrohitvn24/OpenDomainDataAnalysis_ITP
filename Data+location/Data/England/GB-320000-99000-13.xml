		<content> There is a small village hall which is
 the centre for most activities i.e.   
 the youth club, dances, Women's       
 Institute, Mothers Union. Next to the 
 school there is a playing field with a
 pavillion, a tennis court and a small 
 pool. They have cubs in the school.   
 There are lots of public footpaths and
 walking is a popular activity.        
 Skittles are played in the Old Inn.   
 There are  bridleways which show that 
 people do horseriding.
