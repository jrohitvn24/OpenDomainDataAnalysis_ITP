		<title>17The Forest</title>
		<content>    Bransgore is situated very close to
 the west of the New Forest and this   
 plays an important part in the life of
 the village. The forest is a classic  
 example of multi land use and provides
 both enjoyment and livelihood for many
 people.                               
    Important uses of the forest are   
 the grazing of animals, equestrian    
 pastimes and the use of the timber    
 resource.                             
    Ponies and cattle, although wild,  
 all have an owner and carry the owners
 brand, a foal is in the same ownership
 as its mare. Due to the fencing off of
 areas of forest the number of animals 
 has had to be reduced. The Court of   
 Verderers and the Forestry Commission 
 led by the Deputy Surveyor have been  
 given wide powers to enable them to   
 protect the New Forest from           
 encroachment and despoliation.        </content>
