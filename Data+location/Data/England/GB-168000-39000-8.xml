		<title>08Family Life:-A typical day</title>
		<content>    On Wednesday,we all got up at 6.45 
 in the morning and had our breakfast. 
 Mum prepared some sandwiches and we   
 put our fishing gear in the car.At    
 8.50 we went into Camborne and we     
 bought some live bait. Then we went to
 Gwithian beach and we set up our      
 fishing rods. It was very cold on the 
 beach so after we had collected some  
 mussels we went back to the car with  
 some things from the beach.           
    At noon we had our lunch and then  
 we went to Newlyn  and began to fish  
 on the pebbled beach.                 
    At 3.20 we packed up and went home 
 with no fish.When we got home we      
 sorted out our things.Some floats and 
 weights had been lost while fishing.  
 Mum and dad got our dinner. Then  we  
 all sat down in the living room and   
 watched a film on television. At 8.30 
 we had our  supper and went to bed.   </content>
