		<content>  Work starts at 7.30am, packed lunch  
 eaten at 11am, and home for 4.15pm,   
 for a cooked meal. In busy times      
 workers go back to work until stopped 
 by dark or weather.                   
  Farms vary in size from 10 to over   
 900 acres. Fields are large, flat and 
 well drained. Some crop spraying is   
 done by aeroplane.Straw is bailed or  
 chopped, but much is still burnt. The 
 land is then ploughed or cultivated   
 immediately &amp; fertilizer spread.      
 Autumn drilling, potato and sugar beet
 lifting make this a busy time of year.
