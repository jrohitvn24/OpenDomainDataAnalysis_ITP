		<content>    Here is a list of different kinds  
 of farming in our area:               
 dairy,beef,arable and livery.         
    For feeding, the farmers grow long 
 grass for hay and silage which is     
 stored for the winter.Corn is grown to
 provide straw for feeding and         
 bedding.The ears of corn are kept or  
 sold for animal feed.Kale is grown for
 strip grazing in the Winter.          
    Much of the soil is sandy loam.

    At the moment there are 36 cows,the
 best are producing about 2 1/2 litres 
 each milking,5 litres a day.The       
 poorest cows are producing about a    
 litre a day. Normally if a cow gives  
 less than 1 1/2 litres a day they are 
 taken to Tadworth to be destroyed then
 taken away in large freezer container 
 lorries to be shipped abroad,or to be 
 cut up for dog and cat meat or(CONT.) </content>
