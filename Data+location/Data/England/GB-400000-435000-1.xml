		<title>01The Worth Valley</title>
		<content>{Haworth}is a{Pennine}village at the   
 top of the{Worth Valley}.The{River    
{Worth}is a tributary of the{River     
{Aire}and the whole valley is heavily  
 populated and indistinguishable from  
 the suburbs of{Keighley}.Part of the  
 village is in the valley bottom where 
 there are several very large woollen  
 mills only one of which is still      
 manufacturing textiles.The others     
 have been converted to various light  
 industries including the biscuit      
 maker,{Yorkshire Biscuits},which is   
{Haworth's}largest employer.The railway
 runs along the valley from{Keighley}to
{Oxenhope}and is owned by a private    
 society.The rest of the village climbs
 up steeply cobbled streets to the     
 church.Beyond the church are the      
 moors.The village of{Stanbury}on a    
 spur of the{Pennines}is an image of   
{Haworth}200 years ago.                </content>
