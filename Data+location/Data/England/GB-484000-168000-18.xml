 is part of the{Southern Region.}This  
 part of the Southern Region is        
 electrified and runs between London{

 Southern Region).The major stations on

  The station at Bracknell is quite new
 and has a large highrise office block 
 over it.The station has two long      
 platforms for the two lines on which  
 the trains run to and from Waterloo   
 and Reading.There is normally one     
 train in each direction about every   
 thirty minutes,although during rush   
 hour,when many people living in       
 Bracknell commute to London,the trains
 are more frequent.
