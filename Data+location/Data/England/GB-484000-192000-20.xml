		<title>20ENGLAND AND PAKISTAN</title>
		<content> I came over from Pakistan six months  
 ago. I had a terrible pain in my side 
 but my dad would not let me have an   
 operation in Pakistan.                
   I like every thing in England; the  
 veiws, the trees, the parks and the   
 weather. There is more rain than in   
 Pakistan. In Pakistan it only spits a 
 tiny bit.                             
   My favourite food in Pakistan was   
 chaparty and rice but in England I eat
 fish, chicken and egg. In Pakistan I  
 played pitugom, tingeotit and running.
 Tingeotit is like hopscotch and       
 pitugom is like Red Rover.            
   I found the English language very   
 easy to learn and I liked coming to   
 school in England but in Pakistan I   
 did not like school. We learnt Urdu,  
 reading and maths in Pakistan. I like 
 England better than Pakistan.
