		<title>02GURNARD BEACH.</title>
		<content> The village is by the sea, it has     
 a very long beach that stretches from 
 Cowes past Gurnard cliff to Rew       
 Street.The beach is stony and a bit   
 seaweedy but it is a nice beach and   
 lots of people go there in the summer.
 There is a beach shop on the marsh    
 right by the sea. There is also a     
 green by the sea that is good to  sun 
 bathe and play on. Quite a few holiday
 makers come to Gurnard in the summer  
 time.Mostly they stay in the holiday  
 camps or the beach chalets.           
 Further west is Thorness and on the   
 beach near Thorness Bay there are some
 holiday chalets.People live there     
 during the summer. Gurnard is a good  
 place to sail small boats and it has a
 sailing club.
