		<content>       {Willington Power Station       
    There are two stations on the      
 Willington site, both quite similar.  
    Willington'A'station began to      
 generate electricity in 1957. When it 
 is working at its full rate it burns  
 4000 tons of coal each day and of this
 coal there remains 800 tons of ash    
 which is pumped away through pipelines
 and is used in making building blocks.
    Willington'B'stationbegan to       
 generate in 1962.It produces more     
 electricity than the 'A' station but  
 for the same coal usage. The ash from 
 the'B'station is taken away by lorry. 
    When both stations are working, 26 
 million gallons of water are needed   
 each hour.The river Trent supplies 16 
 million gallons each hour and the     
 station condensers provide the rest.  
    Hot water made within the plant is 
 cooled before its return to the river.</content>
