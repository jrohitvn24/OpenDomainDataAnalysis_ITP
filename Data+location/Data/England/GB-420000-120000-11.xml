 One person chases and if he touches   
 you, you have to stand still with your
 feet apart.Someone has to crawl       
 through your legs to free you.If you  
 are caught three times you are "it".  
 Budge it                              
 This is another chasing game but there
 are lots of"homes" where you are safe 
 from the catcher.If someone is on the 
 "home" you want to go to, you say,    
 "Budge it",and they must go to another
 home.

 someone.If the person is hit they must
 join the throwers team.
