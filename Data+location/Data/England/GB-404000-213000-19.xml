		<title>19OTHER LAND USE NEAR YANWORTH</title>
		<content>     The{woods}are too small for viable
 commmercial forestry.   A saw mill and
 equipment only supplies  gates, fences
 etc. for the estate.                  
     The Coln   is  maintained to allow
{private trout fishing parties.        
     Extensive   rearing and  releasing
 of{partridges-pheasants}allows private
 shooting parties after November,  when
 pheasants are wilder and give 'better'
 shooting.    A  very  limited  3  days
 of outside  hiring  is very lucrative.
     Increasing concern to preserve the
 rural  environment  of the  estate  is
 shown  in the  planting  of  over  400
 specimen trees -{silviculture. }A full
 time{waller}is employed to  repair and
 restore field boundaries.             
     The large private acreage of dense
 woodland  with  limited  public access
 means{wild  life }including fallow and
 muntjac deer  can  live in some peace.</content>
