		<title>09The Whitehouse:Ivy Farm.</title>
		<content>  The {Whitehouse},built approx 300    
years years ago used to be 2 separate  
houses the walls were {wattle} and daub
and the roof was lower than it is now  
and was {thatched}.Recently the house  
was modernised,the roof was raised and 
{tiled} and the two houses were rebuilt
to form one house.The house use to     
belong to the {Duke of Lancaster} (the 
Queen)it was bought in 1966 by the     
present owners.                        
  {Ivy Farm} was knocked down,and      
rebuilt about eight years ago and now  
supplies farm equipment.The farms in   
the area are mostly {dairy} and        
{beef}.Cows grased on unsown and       
unfertilised grassland. The farms are  
fairly big(approx.40 acres).Not many   
machines are used,only for milking and 
transporting hay in winter.The {Saddle 
Inn} and {Sitting Goose} are 2 nearby  
public houses.                         </content>
