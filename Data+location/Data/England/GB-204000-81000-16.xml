        {"Fishing"}by Shane Binney.    
         "I go fishing in the sea      
 but I like fishing in a boat best with
 a hand line. Peter thinks beach       
 casting is best.You need a float and a
 ball weight.You can have lots of      
 different hooks.I have two rods.One is
 a river fishing rod.I catch my own    
 bait &amp; I catch mackerel and pollack."
