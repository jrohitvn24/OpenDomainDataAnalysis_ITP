		<title>15HOME LIFE</title>
		<content> MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN OUR    
 AREA ARE BRITISH BY BIRTH &amp; ORIGIN.   
 THERE ARE MANY                        
 PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT BORN IN THE AREA  
 BUT THEY NOW CONSIDER THEMSELVES AS   
 LOCALS.  BY TAKING A SURVEY AND HAVING
 GROUP DISCUSSIONS WE DECIDED THAT     
 THERE WERE SEVERAL THINGS IN COMMON   
 WITH MOST OF OUR HOME LIFES.  WE ALL  
 HAD TELEVISION AND WATCHED IT A GREAT 
 DEAL AND MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF US AT
 SCHOOL HAD A VIDEO AT HOME. HALF OF US
 HAD A COMPUTER IN OUR HOME. THERE WERE
 TELEPHONES IN NEARLY EVERY HOUSE AND  
 MOST OF OUR PARENTS HAD FREEZERS AND  
 WASHING MACHINES.  WE ALL HAD         
 BREAKFAST BEFORE SCHOOL BUT THE THINGS
 WE HAD WERE VARIED.  AT NIGHT WE ALL  
 HAD SUPPER ALTHOUGH SOME OF US HAD    
 MORE TO EAT BECAUSE WE ONLY HAD       
 SANDWICHES AT SCHOOL WHEN SOME        
 CHILDREN HAD  A HOT SCHOOL LUNCH.     </content>
