		<title>03BURY HILL LAKE</title>
		<content>   To most travellers along the A25    
 west of Dorking, the entrance to the  
 Bury Hill Lake access road is merely a
 place to park a caravan, lorry or car 
 for a few minutes rest. To the locals 
 it is a well-trodden road to their    
 favourite leisure activity.           
   Bury Hill Lake is situated to the   
 south of the Nower and is popular with
 local fishermen who pay a daily fee to
 fish its waters. Access is difficult  
 except for fishermen and the area is  
 controlled by a warden.  The lake is  
 well stocked with{Roach, Bream, Carp, 
{Tench and Rudd.}                      
   A study of the marginal plants of   
 the lake reveals that{Yellow Flag and 
{Common Reed}are most often found.{    
{Sweet Flag,}a rare plant in England,  
 may also be found here.               
   Species of wildfowl include{Moorhens
{Canada Geese, Mallards, Coot, Herons. </content>
