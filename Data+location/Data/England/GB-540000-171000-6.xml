   After half an hour we were on the   
M25.After an hour we were at Hall      
Place we left the girls there.Then my  
mum asked if we could go to Ruxley     
Nursery to look for a weeping rose     
bush.At Ruxley Manor Nursery we found a
parking space.Once inside we looked for
the roses.Soon we found them but they  
were only standard.My dad said"Lets try
one more nursery."The last one we tried
was next to Ravenswood school.We went  
in and looked around.I said to my      
dad"Please may I go and see the pets?  
"Of course you can" Dad answered.I saw 
a variety of budgies and canaries.I    
also saw 2 Canadian makaws which cost  
180 pounds each.I looked at some       
Japanese Koi on my way out to look     
for my mum and dad. I found them       
talking to a steward.I heard my mum    
say to him" We'll take that home.      </content>
