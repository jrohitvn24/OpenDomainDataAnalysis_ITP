		<title>06Frocester Court and Barn.</title>
		<content>  Frocester Court and its surrounding  
 land form an ancient and historic area
 with evidence of settlements &amp; farming
 from the Iron Age and Roman Periods.  
 Today the owner of the Court has a    
 great interest in the past and has    
 given his spare time to researching   
 the past. He has excavated sites on   
 the farm and collected artefacts found
 in Archaeological Digs or in walking  
 fields after ploughing.We saw maps of 
 the changes in house sites and farming
 patterns and notes on each house which
 show that Frocester once had several  
 trades and shops within the village.  
  The Court was bought by its present  
 owner in 1970 &amp; he is the first owner 
 to live in the house for over 200 yrs.
  The present stone house,built between
 1450 &amp; 1550 was erected around an     
 earlier timber frame house.
