		<content> The Esso garage in Welford mainly     
 sells petrol and oil to people from   
 Welford and the surrounding villages. 
 About 4000 gallons of petrol and 25   
 gallons of oil are sold per week, and 
 this is delivered from a depot in     
 Birmingham every eight or nine days.  
 The mechanics repair about 30 cars a  
 week. The Post Office in Welford which
 is run by two people also sells food  
 and stationery. There are ten letter  
 boxes in Welford and letters are      
 collected twice a day and sent to     
 Stratford, where the first class      
 letters are removed and the rest      
 forwarded to Leamington to be sorted. 
 The Post Office pays out 250 old age  
 pensions and l50 child benefits each  
 week. In the summer a number of boat  
 people come to the Post Offfice       
 together with caravanners campers and 
 also many foreign tourists.           </content>
