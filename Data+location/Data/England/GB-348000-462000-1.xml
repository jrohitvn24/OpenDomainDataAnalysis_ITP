		<title>01MY LEISURE TIME (I)</title>
		<content>In some of my spare time,I watch       
television.I don't really have a       
particular channel which I watch       
because I think they are all quite     
good.I watch telly for about 3 hours   
each night.As soon as I get in from    
school,I put the telly on,then it      
stays on for the rest of the night.Our 
telly Is a colour telly and I'm glad   
because it is more interesting than    
black/white.Most people watch telly    
because they get bored,and have        
nothing to do or nowhere to go.I enjoy 
reading.Iread every night before I go  
to bed,because it helps me to get      
tired so that I can go to sleep.I read 
comics and annuals because I think     
they are funny and amusing.I also like 
to do some sports.I do some running but
I like to do hockey the most.My        
hobbies are knitting and swimming.I do 
these when I have nothing else to do.  </content>
