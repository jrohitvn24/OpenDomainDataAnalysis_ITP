		<title>19Rochford Market Square</title>
		<content> Traditionally there has always been a 
 market in Rochford Square for hundreds
 of years. In fact, in the Square      
 everything important happened; The    
 Great Fire of 1820, the bonfire to    
 celebrate the relief of Mafeking, the 
 site of the old pump with queues of   
 people drawing water, the sale of wool
 from the Market Hall, market day on   
 Thursday with a cattle sale every     
 other week, executions, circuses,     
 fairs and local assemblies. Nowadays  
 it is quiet in comparison. Market days
 are Wednesday and Saturday. There is a
 wet fish stall, a cheese stall, a pet 
 stall, numerous clothes stalls and    
 fruit and vegetable stalls, all set up
 in the square. The total number seldom
 exceeds twelve. Gone are the saddlers,
 watchmakers and candlemakers and in   
 their place are banks, a post office, 
 a library and also a supermarket.     </content>
