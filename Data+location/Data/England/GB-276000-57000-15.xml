		<content> People in the area tend to be         
 practical. Many of the old houses have
 been renovated by their owners        
 personally, enjoying "doing it        
 themselves". In fact many old crafts  
 are carried out within the areas      
 homes. Also those who have a little   
 land run small businesses, such as    
 goats or poultry.                     
 This practicality also extends to     
 clothing - casuals and wellington     
 boots being more often seen than high 
 fashion!
