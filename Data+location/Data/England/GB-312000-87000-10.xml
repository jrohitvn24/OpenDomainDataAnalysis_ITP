		<content>  Sidmouth caters for{most religious   
{denominations,}including Jehovah's    
 Witnesses.                            
  The{Parish Church}of St. Nicholas and
 St. Giles was rebuilt in 1859-1860.   
 Fragments of Saxon and Norman         
 sculpture found at the time were      
 portions of an unrecorded church. They
 indicate that four churches have stood
 in the parish, namely{Saxon, Norman,  
{Perpendicular}and the present         
 building.                             
{ St. Francis Church}is situated in    
 Woolbrook and is 55 years old. It is  
 reputed to be haunted by the man who  
 has the only grave,-Colonel           
 J.E.L.Balfour. He donated the land for
 the church to be built. His is the    
 only burial to have taken place here  
 because the water table is so high    
 that other graves might flood!
