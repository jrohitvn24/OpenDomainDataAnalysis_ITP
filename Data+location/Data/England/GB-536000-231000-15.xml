		<title>15HOUSING IN WYDDIAL</title>
		<content>  Housing varies greatly. Wyddial Hall 
 is a minor stately home. Wyddial Park,
 Wyddial Parva, the Coach House,the    
 Bury, Beauchamps and Rectory are all  
 substantial houses. At the other end  
 of the scale in the village are six   
 tiny terraced cattages, built as tied 
 cottages about 1900 and only partly   
 modernised. There are four houses of  
 the 1950s and a great variety of      
 bungalows and small houses of the     
 1920s and 1930s. None have main       
 drainage but all have access to mains 
 water and electricity. Calor gas, oil 
 and solid fuel may also be used for   
 heating. Planning for new houses is   
 difficult to obtain. More commonly    
 houses are enlarged by extensions,two 
 or more small cottages are turned into
 one or redundant buildings are turned 
 into houses. As tied farm cottages    
 become empty they are usually sold.   </content>
