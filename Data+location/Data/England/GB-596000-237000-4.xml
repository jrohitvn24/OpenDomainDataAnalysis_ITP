		<title>04 Family life in Polstead.</title>
		<content>  Many families remain in the village  
who are direct descendants of those    
whose names are on the gravestones and 
monuments of Polstead church.These     
families are mainly local farmers.     
Retired people are attracted to        
the village and enjoy walking,         
gardening,and participating in         
village activities.Families are        
attracted to settle in Polstead by the 
advantages of living in the country    
and having space for children to       
play,to keep ponies,a few have their   
own swimming pools and tennis courts.  
People tend to stay in Polstead,few    
move away.House prices are high        
compared with neighbouring towns,      
(60,000 pounds being currently asked   
for a small 1950's two bedroomed       
bungalow on a reasonably sized plot.)  
Families care well for their children, 
one parent families being rare.        </content>
