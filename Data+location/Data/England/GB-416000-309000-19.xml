My day at a football match was on      
Saturday morning at 10 o'clock at      
Glascote.It was a five aside knockout  
tournament.There was about 20 teams.The
players in my team were Daniel,Mark,   
Matthew,Stuart and me.We got on the    
pitch about 10.15a.m.We played against 
Glascote Heath and won 4-0.Daniel      
scored 2 and I scored 2,it was an ace  
match.Then we played Harlaston,we won  
6-3.Stuart scored 1 Daniel scored 1 and
I scored 4.Then in the final we played 
against the holders Drayton Basset it  
was brilliant.We won 3-1 Stuart scored 
1 Mark scored 1 and I scored 1.We had  
won the cup for the very first time.I  
enjoyed myself at the match we had a   
great time.
