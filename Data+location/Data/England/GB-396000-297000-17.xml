		<content>  The decline in large scale industry  
 in recent years has led to many       
 physical changes in the landscape. The
 Black Country, once notorious for air 
 pollution is no longer host to a      
 variety of industries reliant on      
 burning coal. Its mineral wealth has  
 long been exhausted or uneconomic and 
 few traces remain on the surface. Much
 former factory land is now derelict   
 and supports a wide variety o         
 f fauna and flora.                    
  Least evidence is seen in mammals,   
 but foxes, bats and hedgehogs are     
 fairly common. Open spaces like       
 disused railways, canals, and derelict
 sites support small mammals,wild      
 flowers and associated insects. Birds 
 are plentiful, including kestrels,    
 pied wagtails and greenfinches.       
 Several schools are encouraging       
 wildlife in their grounds.            </content>
