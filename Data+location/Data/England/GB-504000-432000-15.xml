		<title>15    North Hull Estate</title>
		<content> There are four main churches within   
 easy reach and many public houses.    
 There are several shops and most of   
 them are vandalised with writing and  
 have windows broken but the shops are 
 cheap.  We are well provided for and  
 there is also a library.  We can catch
 a bus every ten or fifteen minutes if 
 we wish to go into the town centre.   
 I think that it is not a very clean   
 area.  People just drop rubbish which 
 leads to nasty smells.  This is a     
 shame because North Hull Estate would 
 be very nice otherwise.  There are    
 many stray dogs and children often    
 play in the streets.                  
 Some gardens are very tidy, with      
 beautiful lawns and lovely flowers.   
 People must spend hours working in    
 them.  Other gardens are very untidy  
 with long grass and weeds like        
 dandelions in them.                   </content>
