		<title>05VILLAGE HALL MEETING POINTS</title>
		<content>   Neither village in our block now has
 a school, a shop or a rectory and the 
 Village Hall fills in a very important
 gap as a meeting point for residents. 
   The hall at{Cliffords Mesne,}once   
 the village school, is used twice a   
 week by a thriving{Play Group}which   
 draws under 5's from a wide area.     
 Friday night is a regular club night  
 with a variety of events being        
 organised.{The Sunday School}also     
 meets there .                         
   The hall at{Aston Ingham}was built  
 in 1921 and for many years was owned  
 by the{Women's Institute.}It was made 
 over to the village in 1981 but is    
 still used by the Institute.          
   Both halls are used at Elections and
 by organisations wishing to hold      
 meetings. They are also available for 
 private hire. Aston Ingham is at      
 present improving the facilities.     </content>
