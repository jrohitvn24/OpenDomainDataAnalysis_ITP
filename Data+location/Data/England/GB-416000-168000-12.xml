		<title>12MARLBOROUGH'S POLITICS</title>
		<content> Marlborough is an average sort of     
 rural market town in Southern England,
 and as would be expected, most people 
 vote Conservative and hold views which
 are Right of Centre. Until recently,  
 the Liberals have always been the     
 thrid party behind Labour, but now all
 this is changing, with growing        
 discontent among traditional Tory     
 voters. Because of what they see as   
 unjust treatment by the Government and
 the EEC, many are switching their     
 allegiance to the Liberal Party.      
 Labour's poor showing in the recent   
 elections for Wiltshire County Council
 can be put down to tactical voting by 
 the Conservative opposers and this has
 resulted in a council with no party   
 in majority; Jack Ainslie's Liberals  
 are the largest party represented     
 often able to find support from all   
 parties.                              </content>
