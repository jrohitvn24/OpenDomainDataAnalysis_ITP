		<content> We are the third and fourth year boys 
 and girls of{Wykeham C.E.}school and  
 are very excited to be collecting     
 information for the Domesday Project. 
 Our school was built in{1856}by a     
 famous Victorian architect,{William   
{Butterfield.}It has two classrooms and
 the school house is used for extra    
 class space. There are 42 pupils from 
 4+-11 years and 2 full time teachers  
 and 1 part-time. Our headteacher is   
 called Mrs. Wilderspin and she has    
 been here for 19 years. We come from  
 several villages and most of us stay  
 at school for lunch. There is a       
 playing field at the back of the      
 school and we love to get out there   
 for games.                            
 Our villages are all situated in the  
{Vale of Pickering}which was formed by 
 glaciers and left a large glacial lake
 which is now underground.             </content>
