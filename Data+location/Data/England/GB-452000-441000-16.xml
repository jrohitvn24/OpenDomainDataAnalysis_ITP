		<title>16APPLETON ROEBUCK VILLAGE 2</title>
		<content>  There is an active{social life}in the
 village with the pubs,churches.PTA and
 the Tennis club all contributing to   
 make the year very full. Both pubs are
 very busy.The "Roebuck Inn" attracts  
 mainly "locals" but the "Shoulder of  
 Mutton"has a restaurant &amp; bar meals &amp; 
 brings in outsiders.Both Landlords are
 keen to build up their trade &amp; try    
 hard to bring folk in. The{Tennis club
 with matches,tournaments &amp; socials is 
 thriving.The{PTA}once the main body   
 for social events is less important   
 but continues as a fund raising body &amp;
 is to renew its activities in 1986.   
  The{Youth club}has twice-weekly      
 meetings in summer and runs a regular 
 swimming trip in winter.{Sports}      
 facilities other than for tennis are  
 lacking as the school field is too    
 small for adult sports.Entertainment  
 is largely family,TV,or village based.</content>
