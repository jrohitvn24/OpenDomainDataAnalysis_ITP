 rounders,then went in and watched T.V.
 Had my dinner of cheese sandwiches,   
 crisps and cake. Went upstairs to play
 my violin. Had a cup of tea and a     
 jam-tart. Watched T.V. Had tea of pork
 steaklets and mashed potatoes. washed 
 up. Got Stephen(brother) ready for    
 cubs. Dropped him off at 6.30, then   
 went to my Aunty's in Coventry.       
 (Coventry is about 8 miles away from  
 where I live.) Returned home in the   
 car picking up Stephen on the way.    
 Went to bed, watched T.V. until 10.15,
 then fell asleep. My name is Tracy    
 Hancock. I am 12 years old. The date  
 is the 6th May 1985.
