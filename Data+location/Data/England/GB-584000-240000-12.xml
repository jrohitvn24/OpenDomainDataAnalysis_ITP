		<content>  BORLEY RECTORY  In 1956, the Society 
for Psychical Research called this     
building the most haunted house in     
Britain. The first people to have un-  
usual experiences were Rev.Henry Bull  
and his son Rev.Harry Bull. The latter 
saw a ghostly nun, spectral coach,a    
headless man and a ghostly retainer.   
During the time of Rev.G.E.Smith, from 
1928-30, an investigation was begun by 
the Daily Mirror. They sent Harry Price
who claimed footsteps,poltergeists etc.
In the Thirties, Marianne Foyster, the 
Rector's wife found messages written on
the walls and experienced poltergeist  
actions.                               
   Even today local people tell        
stories of strange happenings at Borley
