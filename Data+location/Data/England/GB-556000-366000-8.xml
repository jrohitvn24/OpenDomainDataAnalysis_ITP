		<title>08Small Caravan Site</title>
		<content> Mrs. Wilson-Leary is the owner of a   
 caravan site called Duncannon on the  
 A52 road near Butlin's.There are 29   
 static caravans and space for 10      
 tourers.One tenth of the area is used 
 for recreation which consists of 2    
 slides,2 swings and 1 see-saw.There   
 are no shops or other amusements at   
 all,but there are toilet,washing,sink 
 and shower facilities for the tourers 
 and 2 older caravans.Owners and their 
 families only,are supposed to be on   
 the site,but as is well known,some    
 seem to have a large number of        
 cousins.Each static caravan has its   
 own small garden tended by the        
 occupiers.The grass cutting is done by
 Mr. Wilson-Leary about 3 times a week 
 in wet weather.In case of fire,he has 
 a key to all the vans.In winter none  
 of the vans are occupied but they are 
 inspected daily.                      </content>
