		<title>15TOT HILL GARAGE</title>
		<content>  Tot Hill Garage is situated on the   
A45,which is near to the Chilton Hall  
estate.The 30 year old garage is run by
a staff of 20.The garage site covers 2 
acres.This will be very useful to the  
new restaurant that is planned to      
replace the garage in a few years time.
The garage now sells;oil,newspapers,   
cigarettes,petrol,sweets,groceries,    
snacks,icecreams and cars.On average   
they service about 20 cars a week and  
actually sell 7 cars.As the garage is  
on the A45 it is always busy.The diesel
pump and 3 petrol pumps are very       
productive and have to supply enough   
fuel for the 2-3 hundred cars and      
lorries they have to fill each         
day,totalling 15000 gallons of petrol  
a  week.
