The area is mainly flat with a few     
gentle hills.  There are pockets of    
woodland and one larger wood, Stretton 
Wood, in the south-west.  Most of the  
fields are devoted to mixed farming,   
with grassland predominating.  The     
fields are enclosed by high hedges and 
reached by narrow lanes.  There are a  
number of Dutch barns.  Several brooks 
traverse the area and there are pools  
of varying sizes.  The River Penk is   
crossed by the Cuttlestone Bridge which
dates from the 16th Century.  Several  
of the larger farms - Bickford Grange, 
Kinvaston Hall - Preston Vale, have    
roofs and chimneys which show them to  
be Georgian or earlier.
