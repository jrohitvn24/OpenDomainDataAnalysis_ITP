		<content> Edward VII visited the Keppels at     
 Quidenham Hall. Thomas Fulcher is     
 remembered in the church as he was the
 priest of Old Buckenham for 64 years, 
 dying in 1888. In the windows near the
 pulpit is some medieval glass dating  
 from about 1470 which depicts shields 
 of local landowners, St George and    
 East Anglia. This glass is fairly rare
 as the Puritans abhorred heraldic     
 glass and considered it too gaudy.    
 There is some later glass in the      
 church which is worth noting by C. F. 
 Kempe, who travelled all over the     
 country in the late 19th century. His 
 trademark is a wheatsheaf, which is   
 the 'champion' or 'kempe' of the      
 harvest.                              
 The oldest gravestone in the church   
 yard is dated 1652. People had been   
 buried there long before but the      
 graves were unmarked.                 </content>
