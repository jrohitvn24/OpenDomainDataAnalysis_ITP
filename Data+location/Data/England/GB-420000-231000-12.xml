 a Dennis Water Carrier.The hoses are  
 21 metres long.They have 20 hoses.The 
 tank holds 2275 litres.The engine has 
 Breathing Apparatus and a fog horn on 
 board.They have to test the apparatus 
 every week to see if it works. At the 
{Ambulance}station there are 2 dual-   
 purpose (for emergency and routine)   
 ambulances.They use V.H.F. radios and 
 specialised{equipment.}They also have 
 Breathing Apparatus and 3 cylinders of
 oxygen.Sometimes they get mentally    
 disturbed people so there are special 
 ties to prevent the ambulance men from
 being hurt.They are allowed to travel 
 at speeds up to 145 k.p.h. when called
 out to an emergency.There are eleven  
 ambulance men and they have a shift   
 system to give 24 hour cover.         </content>
