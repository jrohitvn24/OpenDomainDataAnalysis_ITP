		<content> There are many young married couples  
 with children in Thorpe Willoughby.   
 The next most important age group is  
 the over 75's.  Both groups felt that 
 Thorpe Willoughby lacked many         
{facilities and amenities. }Amongst the
 younger people it was felt that there 
 weren't enough sporting facilities -  
 nor, indeed, enough public transport  
 should they want to go elsewhere.     
 Many of the older residents said they 
 would like to have, for example, a    
 bowling green:  younger people wanted,
 for example, a swimming pool.         
                                       
 There are a few general shops in the  
 village but many residents thought    
 that a chemist's shops would be       
 useful.  Bus services run hourly -    
 residents thought that there would be 
 a demand for one that ran every half  
 hour.                                 </content>
