		<content>  To the west of Tilehurst lies the    
 biggest patch of woodland in this     
 area.The wood gets its name from the  
 little village of Sulham which nestles
 at the bottom of Sulham Hill one of   
 the steepest hills around here.       
  The parish of Sulham is a true       
 Anglo_Saxon parish and is recorded in 
 the original Domesday Book.The name   
 comes from the Saxon word Sulh,meaning
 a steep sided valley and the word Ham 
 describes a hamlet in the valley.     
  The wood has survived both farming   
 and building because it covers a      
 steep,chalk escarpment and is now run 
 by the Forestry Commision,although it 
 still belongs to the Wilder family of 
 Sulham Estates and has done since the 
 15th Century.There is public access to
 the woodland and visitors can enjoy   
 walks amongst the trees.
