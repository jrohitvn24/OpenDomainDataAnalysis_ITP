		<title>13PEOPLE AT WORK IN S.CRAVEN</title>
		<content> Results of a survey of 500 families.  
{EMPLOYMENT}Most jobs provided by the  
 Local Authority. The modern Airedale  
 General Hospital provides many        
 part-time and ancillary jobs. Much    
 textile work has gone and new         
 industries have been developed in the 
 old mills e.g. furniture making and   
 light engineering.                    
{TRAVELLING TO WORK}Mostly by car and  
 therefore a decline in Public         
 Transport. 50% of workers travel 5    
 miles. Distance tending to increase.  
{MALE AND FEMALE WORKERS}More men than 
 women full-time workers. Most women   
 with families part-time. 1/5 workers  
 have changed type of job. Equal       
 numbers unemployed.                   
{AIRE VALLEY TRUNK ROAD}Proposed new   
 road could increase population of     
 S.Craven villages: make them dormitory
 areas for Leeds and Bradford.         </content>
