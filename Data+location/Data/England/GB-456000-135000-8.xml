		<content>{EDUCATION}There are no local          
 education facilities. Children attend 
 primary school in Preston Candover and
 secondary education is provided at    
 Perins in Alresford or are educated   
 privately.                            
                                       
                                       
{ENERGY}Every house is provided with   
 mains electricity. In addition some   
 have oil-fired, bottled gas, heat-pump
 or solid-fuel heating and/or cooking  
 appliances. Wood-burning heating      
 stoves are also found. One householder
 draws water from a bore-hole and all  
 the rest have mains water supply.     
 Payment for electricity is levied by  
 the Southern Electricity Board and    
 water rates are levied by the Southern
 Water Authority.
