		<title>02Homes in Aston Cantlow</title>
		<content>    I studied the houses in Aston      
 Cantlow.The most common form of       
 housing was the semi detatched house. 
 I found 25 of those. There were 19    
 cottages mostly terraced,18 detatched 
 houses,6 bungalows plus one being     
 built.There were 5 farms,1 pub,8      
 flats,5 chalets,6 link detatched      
 bungalows and 1 bakery which adds up  
 to 95 altogether.                     
    The pub is run by Whitbreads.There 
 are also quite a few clubs as well.The
 shop is a modern brick building.The 6 
 link detatchd bungalows are for old   
 people.There is one house that is     
 being renovated.A bungalow is also    
 being built up Chapel Road.           
    Some of the buildings are thatched 
 and many are old.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
