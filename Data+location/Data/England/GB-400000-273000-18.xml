		<title>18Homes in Barnt Green</title>
		<content> The overwhelming majority of people in
 the villages of Barnt Green, Cofton   
 Hackett and Hopwood live in owner     
 occupied homes.                       
 There has not been a major house      
 building programme in the area for a  
 long time.   There are a few new      
 houses and bungalows built on small   
 individual plots and these are more   
 expensive to buy than similar         
 dwellings in surrounding areas.       
 As the houses in the area tend to be  
 quite old, there is usually a large   
 garden and these make them ideal for  
 families with children.               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
