		<title>19Kingsley Holt Carnival</title>
		<content>Monday 27 May 1985                     
  The day of the Kingsley Holt carnival
was wet, but the carnival still went   
on. People who were watching had macs  
and umbrellas; I wore my wellingtons.  
There were floats (covered in          
polythene to keep the rain out!) from  
Cheadle, Dilhorne, Ipstones, Kingsley  
and Kingsley Holt. Our Kingsley Holt   
float won second prize.                
  The 12-year-old Kingsley Holt        
carnival queen was crowned, wearing a  
turquoise cloak. Her attendants wore   
pink dresses. There was a troupe of    
dancing girls, who got their suits very
dirty.                                 
 There were many sideshows on the muddy
carnival field; a bottle stall, toy    
stalls and raffles. We won nothing, but
I had 1 pound pocket money to spend. I 
had a 25p go on an inflatable bouncing 
castle, and bought a 20p ice-lolly.    </content>
