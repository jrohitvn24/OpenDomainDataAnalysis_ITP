{*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@} 
 The public houses and restaurants at  
 picturesque{Gunthorpe}attract many    
 visitors.Mrs Scorer, the landlady of  
{The Unicorn Inn,}said that her busiest
 months are June and September.The     
{River Trent}is used for fishing       
 boating and water skiing.It costs{Â£25 
 per annnum to belong to the Ski Club. 
  On July 10th 1985 {Notts County      
{Council's Environment Committee}      
 decided to fill in {4}lagoons beside  
 the Trent and return the land to      
 farm land. This means that many       
 migrant birds and water fowl will     
 disappear from {Gunthorpe.  Gunthorpe 
 is popular with anglers from          
 Yorkshire. Their use of lead weights  
 is causing the deaths of many swans.  
 Fishermen are now being urged to use  
 plastic weights instead.              </content>
