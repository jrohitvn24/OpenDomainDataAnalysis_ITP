		<content> Almost surrounded by the factory      
 buildings of British Cellophane Ltd.  
 is Sydenham Manor, known as {Sideba } 
 at the time of the Norman conquest and
 referred to as such in the original   
 Domesday Book. It is a 'listed        
 building' and must therefore be       
 well_maintained. The authority on     
 historical architecture N.Pevsner     
 describes it as "a picturesque and    
 many_gabled 16th century house with an
 early 17th century range set in front 
 of it".                               
 It is further described as Gothic     
 rather than Renaissance and early     
 Tudor rather than Elizabethan. It is  
 estimated that it was built in 1500   
 and has had a varied career. Currently
 it is used as a dining room by the    
 company directors.Its stone contrasts 
 with the utilitarian brck of the      
 factory.                              </content>
