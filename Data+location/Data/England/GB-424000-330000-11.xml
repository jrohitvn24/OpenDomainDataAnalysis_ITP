		<title>11ST.HELEN'S CHURCH</title>
		<content> St. Helen's Church is the oldest and  
 finest building in the parish. Outside
 is a yew tree which overlooks what was
 the old well. It stands on a high     
 mound surrounded by trees and flowers.
 The church was started about the time 
 of the Norman Conquest and has changed
 during the 15th century. Today the    
 church has traces of different periods
 during the years. In the 19th century 
 three arches were built between the   
 chancel and the nave for safety. The  
 2Oth century is represented by an oak 
 altar in memory of the D'Arcy Clark   
 family. The first organ was bought    
 from Lichfield for Â£45.OO in 1864.    
 The present one was bought 8 years    
 ago.In the tower there are 6 bells    
 three of which were added in 19O5.
