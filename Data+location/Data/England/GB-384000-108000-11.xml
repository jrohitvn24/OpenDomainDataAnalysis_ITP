		<title>11Village of Durweston 1</title>
		<content>  We walked around Durweston looking   
 at the houses. This is what we found. 
{               Walls}                 
  Most walls are made of brick.Not very
 many were made from flint or stone.   
      Brick 48: Stone 9: Flint 5.      
{               Roofs}                 
  Most roofs are tiled. Some are made  
 from slate and 2 houses are thatched. 
     Thatch 2: Slate 13: Tile 19.      
      {  House, Bungalow or Flat}      
  Most people live in houses. There are
 not many people living in bungalows   
 and flats.                            
     House 77: Bungalow 15: Flat 4.    
        {  Names and Numbers}          
  In Haycombe there are more homes with
 numbers than in Water Lane. However,  
 there are more homes with names in    
 Water Lane. Not very many homes in    
 Durweston have both names and numbers.
