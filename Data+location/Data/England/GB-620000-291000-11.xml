		<title>11Farming - shooting game</title>
		<content>{Game shooting}is widespread in the    
 area but only those with connection to
 farming participate. This traditional 
 activity{begins on the 1st September, 
 when partridges can be shot. English  
 partridges in this area are rare      
 (French partridges are more common);  
 this is due to the frequent rain      
 during their breeding months.{Pheasant
{shooting begins on the 1st October.   
 These birds are reared throughout the 
 year for the game shooting period by  
 the local game-keeper. Without his    
 intervention this annual event may be 
 forced to cease as young birds cannot 
 survive naturally. Both seasons       
{conclude on the 31st January.         
 Wood pigeons, rabbits and hares are   
 not shot for sport. They are classed  
 as vermin.                            
 Game shooting has opposition from     
 anti-bloodsport campaigners.          </content>
