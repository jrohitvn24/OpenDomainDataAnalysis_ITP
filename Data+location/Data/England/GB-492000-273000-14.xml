		<title>14Little Addington Greens</title>
		<content> Little Addington has a village green  
that is situated near the church. This 
green is triangular shape and is about 
400 square metres. The  land was       
registed as common land in about 1975, 
but the ownership was disputed about 1 
year later,by the owners of a house    
adjoining the green. The house owner   
threatened to fence in the land so it  
appeared to be his land,but then he    
went to build a porch at the front of  
the house,on common land. The parish   
council could have forced the porch to 
be taken down,but because of all the   
legal and paperwork effort required,the
porch was left standing.A much larger  
piece of land,about 1200 square metres,
that is adjacent to Dovecote Drive,was 
left and became overrun by weeds,when  
the bungalows were built in Dovecote   
Drive.
