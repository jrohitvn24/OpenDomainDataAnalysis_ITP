		<content>   There are 37{footpaths}in our       
 block almost all of which have been   
 in existence for hundreds of years.   
 A new one has been built from Playing 
 Place to Kea School. Most{footpaths   
 are now used for exercise.            
   Almost all Elm trees have been      
 destroyed by{Dutch Elm disease.}New   
 ones ones are being planted.          
   Large birds of prey like{Buzzards   
 are coming back to nest and hunt that 
 they are{protected by Law.}Recently,  
{Red squirrels}have been seen again.   
   Following the destruction of the    
{rabbit}by the disease{Myxomatosis}the 
 rabbits are again breeding well and   
 the{fox}population has also increased.
  {Badgers}are being blamed for causing
{cattle diseases}so the authorities are
 gasing them.Some{conservationists}do  
 not agree with this action and so     
 protest against it.                   </content>
