		<title>20TRADITIONAL BUILDINGS</title>
		<content> Most of the buildings in the area     
 which are over one hundred years old  
 are made from local building          
 materials.                            
 Clay which was dug around most of the 
 villages was made into soft red bricks
 and roof tiles.The roof tiles are     
 called Pantiles.                      
 A lot of old buildings are thatched   
 with local reed gathered from the     
 edges of the broads.The thatch lasts  
 about 80 years.Originally it was a    
 cheap material to use,now to thatch a 
 typical small cottage costs about     
 Â£3,000.                               
 Some old buildings are made from clay 
 lump.This is a mixture of clay, straw 
 and sometimes animal dung which is    
 formed into blocks and left to dry in 
 the sun.When built into a wall these  
 blocks are covered on the outside with
 tar to make them waterproof.          </content>
