		<title>14Staploe Parish Social Club</title>
		<content> Losing Eaton Socon to Cambridgeshire  
 in 1965 left Staploe's scattered      
 population with little social         
 cohesion until the Silver Jubilee in  
 1977. A social club was started aimed 
 at widening contacts and interests. A 
 simple formula evolved to net all     
 willing helpers. Questionnaires are   
 circulated, asking each household if  
 anyone will attend or help organise a 
 number of suggested events, consider  
 election to one of the three officer  
 posts, or has any ideas worth putting 
 into practice. Fund raising is not a  
 primary aim but organizers budget to  
 cover costs. Small surplusses finance 
 childrens events. Whist,              
 darts,Hallowe'en and Christmas parties
 are regular favourites but special    
 effort is made to introduce new talks,
 visits, handicrafts or anything       
 involving enough people to fund itself</content>
