		<title>07SARAH'S DAY</title>
		<content> I get up at 7.30 and put my clothes   
 on.  I go down stairs, comb my hair   
 and get my breakfast.  At 8.20 I have 
 a drink then I put on my coat and go  
 to school at 8.30.  Mrs Sumby does    
 the register and we do some work till 
 play_time.  We have our milk and go   
 out at quarter to 11.  I usually play 
 with the skipping rope.  When we come 
 in from play_time we have numbers or  
 art.  After dinner we have a play_time
 and then we have story.  When I go    
 home I watch television or play       
 rounders.  At half past 6 I have my   
 tea and go out until half past 7.  I  
 go to bed at quarter to nine.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
