		<content> In 1978 a village meeting was held in 
 Belmont to form a Residents           
 Association.This continues to provide 
 activities for the{community} .There  
 are ten members on the committee.When 
 the Residents Association first began 
 all the events were better supported  
 than they are now.Most of the{events  
 take place in the village,using either
 the school or the Sailing Club.       
                                       
 Every year in Belmont Village there is
 a{fete}which is held on the           
 park,organised by the Residents       
 Association.This costs about five     
 hundred pounds.It includes side shows,
 children's{sports}and various         
 displays.A disco is held for all the  
 village at the Sailing Club.The over  
 sixties have a supper.
