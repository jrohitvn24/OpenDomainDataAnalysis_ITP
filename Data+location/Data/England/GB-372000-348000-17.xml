		<title>17  FARMING AND THE LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content>    In this area the farming has not   
changed the landscape too much.        
The co-op have pulled out a lot of     
hedges on their farms to make room for 
their combined harvesters by making the
fields bigger.Quite a lot of farmers   
pipe ditches off to make fields bigger 
and to save money because they do not  
have to build bridges .This has often  
meant moving hedges which are along    
side the ditch.The colour of landscape 
has  changed as well as there are      
now oilseed rape crops so there are    
fields which are bright yellow in      
May and June.Many farms still have     
cows or bullocks grazing and so they   
leave the trees and hedges in.The      
hedges usally look neat now because of 
the mechanical hedge cutters on the    
tractors.
