		<content> In Porthleven we did a survey on what 
 kind of houses people live in. We     
 decided that it would be very         
 difficult to do a survey on the whole 
 of Porthleven so we confined it to our
 school. In our school we have one     
 hundred and thirty one pupils. Forty  
 six live in a semi detached house,    
 twelve in a detached house, thirty    
 eight in a bungalow, one in a semi    
 detached bungalow, four in a flat,    
 twenty eight in terraced houses and   
 two live in cottages in the country.  
 The older houses are found mainly     
 around the harbour and the newer      
 bungalows are on estates on the       
 outskirts of the village. Some of the 
 older houses are over two hundred     
 years old.
