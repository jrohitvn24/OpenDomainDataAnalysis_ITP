		<title>13A Day In The Life.</title>
		<content> My name is Christy Cooke and I am 10  
years old.I live near Chelsfield with  
my Mum,Dad and my sister Tracy.I am    
writing about a normal day in my life. 
 I would normally get up at 7.20a.m.   
get dressed and have breakfast.At 8.35 
I wait at the top of our drive ready to
be picked up by my neighbour to go to  
school.Before school starts I play with
my friend for a little while.          
 The bell for the start of lessons goes
at 8.55 and we all go into class.At    
10.10 we go in to assembly and then at 
10.30 we have a break.After this       
lessons start again until lunch time.I 
have packed lunches but you can have   
meals prepared by the school.Lessons   
continue again until 3.30 when it is   
home time.                             
 As soon as I get home I make a cup of 
tea for my Dad.Sometimes I go to ballet
but usually we have tea then watch T.V.</content>
