 There used to be a great sense of     
 community especially among terrace    
 dwellers.Summer evenings were spent in
 allotment gardens or gossiping in the 
 backyard while children played street 
 games.Families often walked out       
 together in the evenings;in           
 winter,they listened to the wireless  
 and played indoor games together.Most 
 children attended Sunday School;      
 many,who went to the Methodist        
 Chapels,had the Anniversary as a      
 special treat.We now have Community   
 Centres but not the same degree of    
 neighbourliness.Evenings are spent    
 watching T.V.,in the local pub,going  
 out in cars,or playing Bingo in the   
 local clubs.Street games have         
 been replaced by aggressive,          
 disorganised behaviour,and there is a 
 plethora of graffiti.{J.D.Fisher}     </content>
