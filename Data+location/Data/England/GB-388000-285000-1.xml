		<content>    Industrial development and         
 re-development have fashioned much of 
 this area over the last few centuries.
 Land once used for industries like    
 brick and tile manufacturing, for     
 chain and nail making and for mining  
 (both deep and open-cast) is now being
 re-developed to provide modern housing
 estates which, together with blocks of
 flats, established areas of old       
 terraced dwellings, Edwardian and     
 Victorian houses comprise the major   
 portion of our 12 sq.km grid.         
    The whole area is made up of small 
 inter-linked communities, such as     
{Brockmoor, Wordsley}and{Amblecote,}all
 of which have been severely affected  
 by factory closures and unemployment. 
 However the glass industries at       
{Wordsley}and{Brierley Hill}continue   
 to flourish and provide a tourist     
 attraction.                           </content>
