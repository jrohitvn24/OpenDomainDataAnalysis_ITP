		<content>{WINESTEAD PUMPING STATION}            
 Built in 1978 and classed as a Booster
 Station for a second station situated 
 on the River Humber banks for         
 subsequent discharge from Winestead   
 Drain into the River Humber.  It is   
 capable of pumping at a rate of 120   
 cubic feet per second using 2 electric
 140 h.p. pumps. The drainage area     
 covered is 2711 hectares (6700 acres) 
 which is liable to flooding.  Included
 in this area are villages and farms   
 situated in Welwick, Winestead and    
 Patrington.                           
 The expected probability of the scheme
 is 30 years.                          
 The Pumping Station is not            
 continuously manned, being capable of 
 remote control operation, but is      
 inspected daily by the Yorkshire Water
 Authority personnel.
