		<title>16St.Margarets,Ventnor.</title>
		<content>  I live in St.Margarets which is in   
 Lowtherville,near Ventnor.Most of the 
 area is downs but there are some roads
 with 2 shops,1 factory, 2 schools and 
 the main road to Newport.             
  Trans-Atlantic Plastics is a         
 factory making goods made of rubber   
 and plastic.It is 29 years old ,before
 that it used to be an R.A.F station.  
  Ventnor Middle School used to be     
 a secondary school for 11-16 year     
 olds.Now there are 480  children      
 between 9-16 years.St.Margarets School
 was also a part of the R.A.F. station.
 There are 80 children aged 4-9 at the 
 school.                               
  There are 2 shops in the area.Janes  
 is a hairdresers,the other sells coal 
 and food.                             
  I like living in St.Margarets because
 of the downs where there are lots of  
 camps for me to play in.              </content>
