		<title>06ARABLE FARMING IN WEST CAMBS</title>
		<content>     The area is predominantly         
 agricultural, with most of the land   
 devoted to arable farming.   Cereal   
 crops, especially barley and wheat,   
 are grown extensively, with peas,     
 beans and oilseed rape as change      
 crops.                                
                                       
     On the outskirts of Catworth, a   
 small farm specialises in the growing 
 of soft fruit, which is marketed at   
 the farm shop or on a 'pick your own' 
 basis.                                
                                       
     Farms are large, but the highly-  
 mechanised farming methods used mean  
 that comparatively few workers are    
 employed.                             
                                       
     Approximately half the farmland is
 privately owned and the remainder     
 rented.                               </content>
