		<title>04THE VILLAGE HALL, FAIRWARP</title>
		<content> The village hall in Fairwarp is a     
 large wooden hut with a stage at one  
 end, with curtains. A small kitchen is
 by the side. The hall can be used for 
 entertainment or lessons. The village 
 fete raises funds for the hall. We    
 went there to see The Wind in the     
 Willows and I enjoyed it. The village 
 hall can also be used for Women's     
 Institute and for playgroups. The hall
 is often used for parties. People go  
 there for different meetings such as  
 The Forest Club.                      
 Nearby is a nature reserve. Some      
 people go there to meet their         
 friends. People have Yoga lessons     
 there too. There is a space for the   
 cars outside.
