		<title>10CUSTOMS OFFICERS, ST.HELIER</title>
		<content>   The Customs Officers start work at 8
 am. They go first to check the cargoes
 of ships in the Harbour against the   
 manifest to make sure that the correct
 duty is paid on all goods entering    
 the island. Almost all the things the 
 island needs have to be imported, and 
 all have different rates of duty on   
 them. This duty helps bring in large  
 sums in revenue. In one year alone the
 duty on petrol comes to Â£1.5m. There  
 is a duty on all wines either imported
 or local. Every barrel of spirits is  
 tested for volume and strength and    
 every 3 or 4 days the local brewery is
 checked.                              
   A major concern is to prevent the   
 entry of animals from France because  
 of the risk of rabies, but there is   
 free movement to Britain.             
   Sadly,the Customs Officer must now  
 keep a close watch for drug smuggling.</content>
