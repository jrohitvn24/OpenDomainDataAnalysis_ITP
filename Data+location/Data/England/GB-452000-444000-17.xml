 Beer Guide.The Buckles Inn is on the A
 64 near Askham Bryan College.It is a  
 1930s roadhouse on the site of an old 
 coaching inn;relies on passing trade, 
 especially meals;has gone up-market in
 recent years;sells Samuel Smith's-real
 ale.Ye Olde Sun Inn at Colton has real
 ale-Bass and Stones.An attractive old 
 building,it has 4 rooms with low-beam 
 ceilings,pretty gardens and outdoor   
 drinking area,plus a substantial car  
 park.The Three Hares at Bilbrough has 
 been extended taking in the old smithy
 -more emphasis now on catering.The car
 park is poorly sited so customers park
 on Main St. to the annoyance of the   
 locals.The Wild Man on the A64 is a   
 1930s roadhouse.It caters for casual  
 trade.These two sell John Smith's,who 
 stopped brewing real ale in Oct. 1974.</content>
