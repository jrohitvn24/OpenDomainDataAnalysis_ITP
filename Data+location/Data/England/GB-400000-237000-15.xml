		<title>15A DAY IN THE LIFE OF DARREN</title>
		<content> A typical Wednesday would start off   
 for me at 7.30am.  At 8 o'clock I     
 would have breakfast which consists of
 cereal, bread and apple juice.  At    
 8.30am I set off for school on my     
 bike.  I arrive at school and talk    
 with my friends.  At 8.50am we go into
 school and at 9 o'clock we have       
 Assembly.  In between Assembly and    
 Playtime we do Maths.  At Playtime we 
 play football.  Afterwards we do      
 English and then we have lunch at 12  
 noon.  After lunch we use the computer
 and in the afternoon we sometimes have
 Games or Art.  We have another        
 Playtime at 2.40pm and at 3.20pm we go
 home.  When I get home I change out of
 my school uniform and go out to play  
 with my friends.  At 7.30pm I go      
 swimming and at 9 o'clock I go to bed.
