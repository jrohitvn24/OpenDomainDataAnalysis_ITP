		<title>03THE WOODBECK ESTATE</title>
		<content> Every morning I get up at 8.00am, get 
 dressed and walk a mile to school. We 
 do get fed up a bit, me, my brother   
 and my mum. She comes with us every   
 day and collects us each night. The   
 road we have to cross is very         
 dangerous. We live on the estate      
 because my dad works at the hospital. 
 The estate was especially built for   
 hospital workers. When we get home at 
 night we go to the shop. It is a Post 
 Office and a General Store. You can   
 also borrow books and videos there.   
 There are lots of people on the       
 estate. It seems a dirty place at the 
 moment because some of the houses are 
 being demolished and others           
 modernised.It is quite a pleasant     
 place to live.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
