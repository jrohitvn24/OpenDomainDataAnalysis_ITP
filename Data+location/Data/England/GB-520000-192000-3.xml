 Grid Squares 1,2,3_ Swimming(most of  
 the people surveyed were fairly       
 old,which stopped them from going.    
 There are no public swimming pools in 
 the immediate area and therefore      
 they found other forms of leisure).   
 Cinema(this is considered to be lower 
 to middle class and the area is upper 
 class. Compared to the theatre cinema 
 going was less popular).Clubs(visited 
 mainly by elderly women).

 they do not visit the park often).    </content>
