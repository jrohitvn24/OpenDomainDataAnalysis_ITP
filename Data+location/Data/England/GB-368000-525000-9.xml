		<title>09DUFTON VILLAGE INSTITUTE</title>
		<content> This hall,given originally to the     
 village by Lord Hothfield as a        
 Conservative Club,is now more         
 extensively used than for some time.  
 There is no Church Hall,&amp; since the   
 school closed it has been the only    
 available place for all village       
 meetings,social events &amp; polling      
 station for elections.The Institute is
 regularly used by the Youth Club,the  
 Badminton Club &amp;the WI.Increased costs
 of heating,lighting &amp; upkeep are a    
 problem to be faced by a small        
 committee.The Parish Council has given
 grants &amp; Job Creation has helped with 
 decorating,but improvements have been 
 postponed because the floor of the    
 main hall urgently needs renewing. All
 groups in the village who use the Hall
 are running extra fund-raising events 
 to try &amp; collect money for the floor. 
 This is both fun &amp; exhausting.        </content>
