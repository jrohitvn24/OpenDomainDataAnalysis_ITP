		<title>09Fashions in N.Duffield</title>
		<content> Fashions of North Duffield are very   
 plain. We went out and asked several  
 people what kind of clothes they liked
 wearing best.Older women liked wearing
 dresses best,with wedged heels shoes  
 to match. They don't bother about     
 make-up,but do like wearing hats.     
 Younger women do not like wearing     
 hats, but like wearing skirts and     
 tops,also they like wearing high      
 heeled shoes. We asked one man.He     
 liked wearing suits with a tie and    
 shoes to match, but does not wear     
 t-shirts,and prefers overcoats to     
 raincoats.This man likes trilby hats  
 better than flat caps. These are the  
 fashions of the 1980's in a small,    
 quiet village.
