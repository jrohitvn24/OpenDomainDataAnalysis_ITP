		<title>11Knolton Hall,Ellesmere CP</title>
		<content> Knolton Hall is set in 106 acres of   
 land.The land used to be farmed but is
 now let to other people.The River Dee 
 and the Shell Brook form 2 of the     
 boundaries and a third one is the     
 B5069 road. This large house and its  
 lodge were built in Tudor times and is
 distinguished by having 12 chimneys.  
 The family who live there today only  
 use about one third of the house.Many 
 of the rooms which are not used       
 include a dairy larder, a laundry room
 and a dead game room. Most of the     
 rooms have high ceilings with plaster 
 mouldings and wooden floors, mostly   
 furnished with wooden antiques. Every 
 room in the house has 4 or 5 windows  
 which are very long and narrow. The   
 doors to the rooms are of solid wood  
 having large brass knobs. The many    
 fireplaces are large and made of      
 marble and cast-iron.                 </content>
