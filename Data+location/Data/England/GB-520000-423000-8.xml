		<content> THE ONLY NON-FARMING INDUSTRY IN THIS 
 AREA IS THE GRAVEL PITS. THESE PITS   
 COVER AN AREA OF ABOUT HALF A SQUARE  
 KILOMETRE,AND ALTHOUGH EFFORTS HAVE   
 BEEN MADE TO DISGUISE THEM WITH RAISED
 PERIMETERS AND TREE PLANTING,THEY ARE 
 STILL A NOTABLE FEATURE OF THE        
 LANDSCAPE. OPEN FOR ABOUT 15          
 YEARS,THEY DESCEND 20 METRES INTO THE 
 EARTH,AND HAVE ENOUGH SAND AND GRAVEL 
 IN THEM TO LAST ANOTHER 12 YEARS. THE 
 SAND AND GRAVEL IS EXCAVATED AT A RATE
 OF ABOUT 60 TONS AN HOUR. THE PRODUCT 
 IS USED BY THE LOCAL BUILDING         
 INDUSTRY, ALTHOUGH MUCH TOP SOIL      
 HAS BEEN USED TO STRENGTHEN THE       
 NEARBYE RIVER BANK. ONLY 7 PEOPLE WORK
 AT THE GRAVEL PIT: 5 WORKERS,1 MANAGER
 AND1 SECRETARY.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
