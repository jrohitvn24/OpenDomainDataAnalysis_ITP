		<content> The town of Pontefract has gained from
 the use of computer systems-from the  
 use of Kimball tags to the use of Main
 Frame computers in the Town's banks   
 and Library.The Library computer      
 allows a much greater service for the 
 public using a Barcode &amp; Wand         
 system.The computer also allows the   
 librarians to find out very quickly   
 the place of any book.The banks &amp;     
 building societies have also improved 
 their service by using Mini-banks     
 which stay open 24 hours a day.The    
 Shop of the Future-"Argos" is also    
 making great use of computers.Its     
 point of sale terminals using a       
 Barcode &amp; Wand system allows the      
 cashier to find out wheather the      
 product is available or not.In many   
 shops tha sale of home computers is   
 the norm,with a lot of shops trying to
 get in on the boom industry.          </content>
