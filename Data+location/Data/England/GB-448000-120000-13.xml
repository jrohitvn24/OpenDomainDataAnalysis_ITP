		<title>13Employment in Colden Common</title>
		<content> The only sources of employment in the 
 village are a building contractor and 
 a motor engineer.The majority of the  
 44 staff at Marwell Zoological Park   
 live locally but not exclusively in   
 Colden Common.                        
 A sample survey revealed that 91% of  
 heads of households interviewsed      
 worked outside the village,most of    
 them in Eastleigh,Winchester and      
 Southampton.Of those surveyed almost  
 40% could be regarded as being in     
 managerial and professional           
 occupations.                          
 These facts reinforce the impression  
 that Colden Common is essentially a   
 dormitory settlement.Many of the      
 interviewees felt that the village    
 combined the benefits of living in the
 countryside with easy access to the   
 amenities of the town,provided that   
 private transport was available.      </content>
