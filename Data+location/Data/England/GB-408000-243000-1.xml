		<title>01BRETFORTON AND HONEYBOURNE</title>
		<content> The square is dominated by the        
 villages of Bedforton and Honeybourne,
 these small centres of habitation     
 being surrounded mainly by grazing    
 land and land cultivated mostly for   
 market gardening. Long Lartin Security
 Prison is in the northern area of the 
 square to a storage area owned by     
 British Leyland. the square is        
 bisected by an Inter City Rail link   
 running east to west; the station at  
 Honeybourne has recently been reopened
 after some consumer pressure.
