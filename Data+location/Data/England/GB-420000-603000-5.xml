		<title>05Place Names/Guyzance Area.</title>
		<content> The place names in this area can be   
 traced back to the Angle and Norman   
 invasions.The Angles crossed the North
 Sea and settled along the River       
 Coquet.They cleared the forests,      
 cultivated the land and kept animals. 
 The names of these settlements are    
 stil reflected in farm names          
 today.Brotheraick derives             
 from"Brodor's wic"_a farm belonging   
 to Brodor;Morwick was a farm in a fen 
 and Brainshaugh is  corruption of     
 "Bregwines's haugh".A haugh is an area
 of flat land next to a river.Guyzance 
 dates from the Norman Conquest.Guines 
 was a village near Calais.The first   
 lord of Alnwick after the conquest,   
 Gisbert Tison,gave "Gisyng" to his    
 son,Richard Tison.He then gave the    
 chapel of "Gysyns" to a community of  
 nuns from Alnwick.
