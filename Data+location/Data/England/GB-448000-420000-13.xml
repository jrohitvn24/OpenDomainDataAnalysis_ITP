		<title>13DARRINGTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Darrington is a quiet,attractive      
 village.In the centre the houses are  
 made of stone.This is the original old
 part of the village.There are some    
 farmhouses and old cottages and in the
 centre is the old stone parish church 
 called "All Saints".There is also the 
 old school building but this is no    
 longer in use as they have moved to   
 new premises across the lane.{There is
{no General Store in the village}but in
 our study area there is a Post Office,
 an equestrian suppliers,a hairdressers
 and a pub.An old lady who has lived in
 Darrington all her life told us of a  
 legend about three village pubs.It    
 said,"The Ship will sink,the Crown    
 will fall but the Eagle will fly on   
 forever".The first two have long      
 ceased to exist but the pub in our    
 area is called The Spread Eagle.
