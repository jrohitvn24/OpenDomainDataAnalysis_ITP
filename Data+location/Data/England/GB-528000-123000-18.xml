		<content>  Many adults swim regularly at        
 Haywards Heath leisure centre. TV is  
 not regarded as important, few watch  
 it for more than 2 hrs per day and few
 people own videos. The most popular   
 programmes are news items and         
 documentaries. Radio 2 is popular.    
 Classical music is more widely        
 listened to than pop. Few adults ever 
 go to discos. Computers are popular,  
 most are used for playing games.      
 Reading is a favourite pastime, most  
 adults being members of a library. The
 most unpopular jobs around the home   
 are washing up and ironing. With      
 regard to holidays, 3-5 weeks is the  
 average, most people going abroad at  
 least once a year, preferring to stay 
 in hotels, their favourite place being
 France. Few adults smoke, most enjoy  
 eating out. On the whole adults feel  
 leisure facilities in the area good.  </content>
