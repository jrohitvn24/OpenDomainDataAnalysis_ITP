		<content> God has had a profound influence on my
 life &amp; work.It began at Bethlehem on  
 Christmas Eve 1945 when I was in the  
 RAMC.In the Church of the Holy        
 Nativity (at the entrance to the cave 
 where Christ was born) I was arrested 
 by a wonderful feeling.I seemed to    
 glow inwardly.My over_riding feeling  
 was one of joy at having received the 
 Holy Spirit of God.                   
                                       
{As an Orthopaedic Surgeon}I thought of
 mechanical replacements for diseased  
 and injured joints.About 1940 I bought
 out my first prototypes using chrome  
 cobalt (a new metal alloy). 1951 saw  
 my first 3 total hip replacements at  
 the Norfolk &amp; Norwich Hospital.       
 1953-1963 I carried out a series of 27
 cases,the first series of such a size 
 ever carried out.                     
                                       </content>
