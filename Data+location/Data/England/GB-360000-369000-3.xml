		<title>03VALE FARM, WHITEGATE</title>
		<content> To encourage these animals, the farmer
 has planted many trees, including     
 silver birch and scots pine.          
 The owner refuses to use chemical     
 sprays.  Instead she digs up the      
 ragwort and burns it.  This plant is  
 most poisonous when the flowers turn  
 from green to yellow to brown.  The   
 cows are attracted to the sweet smell.
 They then eat the flowers and often   
 die.                                  
 The farm has a copper deficiency in   
 the soil.  To counteract this the     
 farmer ties mineral blocks containing 
 copper, zinc and magnesium, to her    
 fences for her cattle to feed upon as 
 an extra vitamin.  The owner also     
 places Rumaviten in water troughs to  
 aid digestion.                        
 Another feature of the farm is the    
 beautiful eye-catching white          
 farmhouse.                            </content>
