		<content> The thing's I found out at Kings Cross
is that they do not know who built     
Kings Cross but the station is 102     
years old. They don't know where the   
bricks came from. The electritians look
after the clock because the clock is   
electric and it has Roman numerals on  
it. The British railways board owns the
station H.S.T. means high speed train  
one of the trains was the Flying       
Scotsman. They used to have eight lines
but know they have ten. Lots of train  
guards look after the station. The     
station doesn't close. Do you know the 
Great Northan Railway Company payed for
kings cross to be built and do you know
the furthest the trains can go is 487  
miles Kings Cross to Inverness and the 
last to come in is at 11.45pm.         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
