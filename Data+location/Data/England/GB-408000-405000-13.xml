		<title>13Energy - Peat digging</title>
		<content> An act of 1828 related to the local   
 enclosure award gives the right of    
 those born in the Graveship of holme  
 to dig peat from the moors.           
   These rights are still exercised by 
 some of the people in the area who dig
 peat for there own use,for they are   
 not allowed to sell it.               
   The laws related to peat digging are
 closely guarded by the constables of  
 the Graveship of Holme,an ancient     
 tiltle which still survies.           
   There was some decline in peat      
 digging in the 1960's and 70's when   
 the the cost of other fuels-oil and   
 gas in particular-was comparativly    
 cheap Since that time however the     
 digging of peat has been revived,     
 partly as a result of increased       
 unemployment.The peat when first dug  
 is made up of 70% water and requires  
 some weeks to dry.                    </content>
