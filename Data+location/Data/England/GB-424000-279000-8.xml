		<content>{COAL MINE.}Local people have been     
 upset by the proposals of the National
 Coal Board to mine coal in the south  
 of the block. They fear that mining   
 150 million tons over 50 years would  
 spoil this peaceful area. Pithead     
 buildings would appear in the middle  
 of the green belt,the winding tower   
 would be as high as a 20 storey block 
 &amp; the environment would be affected by
 noise &amp; dirt.The dumping of mine spoil
 would change the area for ever.There  
 is fear of subsidence &amp; falling values
 of homes.In Eastern Grn.parents are   
 concerned that there will be more     
 heavy lorries  passing through the    
 area.   {MILLISON'S WOOD,}in Nov 84,  
 after failing to get permission to    
 build,a landowning firm chopped down  
 40 silver birch trees.Local residents 
 protested.Preservation order achieved 
 after T.V.&amp; press publicity.          </content>
