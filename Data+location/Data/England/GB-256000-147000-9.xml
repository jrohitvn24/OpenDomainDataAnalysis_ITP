		<content>      The Carnival Parade takes place  
 each year on the first Wednesday in   
 August.  There are always many        
 decorated floats, lots of people in   
 fancy dress &amp; several local bands.    
 The whole week is devoted to Carnival 
 activities.                           
      On the Saturday before the Parade
 King Carnival arrives by boat and at  
 an evening of entertainment with      
 sideshows and stalls etc the new      
 Carnival Queen is chosen.  The Fairy  
 Queen is chosen at a similar          
 entertainment and this and other      
 events can include a Talent           
 Competition, Pet Show &amp; Donkey Derby  
 etc.                                  
      Two contests which are always    
 held are the Wheelbarrow race from the
 top of the village to the beach and   
 the Raft Race for home made rafts     
 which is held in the Bay.             </content>
