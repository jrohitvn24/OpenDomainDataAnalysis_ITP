		<title>02A DAY AT A PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content>     I get up at about 7.20, wash and  
dress, have breakfast which is usually 
Weetabix and a drink, then I get on the
coach that takes me to school (Bedding-
ton Park Farm Primary School).  I have 
to travel on the coach because there is
no public transport and we live on a   
small housing estate a couple of miles 
from the school.                       
     My lessons are usually Maths, then
playtime, followed by English and read-
ing.  Lunch break is at 12.00 and ends 
at 1.20.  After that we have general   
studies and we go home at 3.15.  I go  
home on the coach, change, and go out  
to play with my friend Ben.            
     I come in at 5.30 for my tea.     
Then I either watch television, help   
my mum with my baby brother or go out  
to play again. Bedtime is usually      
about 9 o'clock.                       
                                       </content>
