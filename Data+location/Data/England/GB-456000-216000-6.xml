		<title>06HOUSES IN MERTON.</title>
		<content>Hacun the Dane was the founder of      
Merton.The houses today have been built
mainly along the straight street which 
runs through the centre of the village.
Greenbelt policy has prevented Merton  
from growing bigger as it has been     
decided to keep land surrounding the   
village as farmland.Any new houses     
built recently have been built in      
existing spaces between the houses.Some
of the houses have been built of       
Bradstone,others of red brick but the  
original houses were built of stone.   
Some houses are conversions of other   
buildings such  as an old tithe barn,  
the old school,or a dovecote.There is  
only one working farm left in Merton.  
This is West End Farm which is situated
behind the Plough Public House.The     
Public House is the oldest building in 
the village.It is currently having an  
extension added to house a restaurant. </content>
