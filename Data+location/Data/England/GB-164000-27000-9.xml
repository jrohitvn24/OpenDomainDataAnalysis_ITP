		<title>09SHOPPING IN HELSTON</title>
		<content>{Helston}is a busy shoppiong centre.   
 There are 90 shops in the two main    
 streets, Meneage Street and           
 Coinagehall Street. Of these 20 sell  
 food, 16 sell clothes and 5 sell      
 stationery. There are shoe shops,     
 furniture shops, iron mongers and     
 chemists. In fact, it is possible to  
 purchase anything from a piano to a   
 wet suit in Meneage Street. We are    
 encouraged to invest our money in     
 either the 4 building societies or the
 5 banks. There is a choice of 5       
 hairdressers, two dental surgeries, a 
 chiropodist and an optician. The      
 shopping arcade in Coinagehall Street 
 opened in 1983, giving Helston another
 20 small shops. On Saturdays and      
 Mondays there is an open air market of
 about 10 stalls in Coinagehall Street,
 which adds to the atmosphere of our   
 market town.                          </content>
