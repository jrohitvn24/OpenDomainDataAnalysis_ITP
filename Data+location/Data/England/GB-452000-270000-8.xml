   R. and D. Clark make engineering    
 tools for companies. They will make   
 them to order. Most of the work is    
 done by hand but some is done by      
 machine. The building was built 25    
 years ago. The first firm who took it 
 over made shooting sticks, the second 
 made baby buggies and then R and D    
 Clark took it.

   On the way out of Barby there is a  
 small Industrial Estate, but now it is
 mostly derelict. There is however a   
 car repair and spray Garage and the   
 Fencing firm. They actually make the  
 fencing in a shed made out of old bits
 of fence. They make weave fencing or  
 lap. Their prices are much cheaper    
 than Payless. We were surprised to see
 a lady in charge of making the fences.
