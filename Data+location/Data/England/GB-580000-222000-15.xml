 small shop and Post Office.A Community
 Association was formed after the 1977

 Stised;inhabitants seem unwilling to  
 leave the village.The village primary 
 school is an important source of      
 contact between villagers,through     
 their children.There will be          
 infilling,but no big new building     
 development,as the village is a       
 conservation area.

 event.Petanque and rounders are       
 popular games.
