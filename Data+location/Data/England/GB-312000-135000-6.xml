		<title>06The Three Crosses</title>
		<content>    There are 3 crosses in Crowcombe.  
  One is the{Market Cross.}This was    
 once the centre of the old village    
 market and dates from{1226.}You can   
 see signs of wear on its steps from   
 those who sat on them selling their   
 produce. This cross was to remind     
 people to be good{neighbours.}        
    Outside the church porch is the    
 original{Churchyard Cross}with its    
 sculptured figures. The top was       
 damaged and has been replaced. One    
 figure is St.John the Baptist. The    
 woman being blessed by a mitred bishop
 is probably the prioress of Studley.  
    The{Memorial Cross}remembering two 
 world wars was moved to its present   
 site near the{Church House}by         
 Crowcombe parishioners after the 1939 
 _ 1945 war in grateful memory of those
 who served and did not return.
