		<title>14The Bryanston Estate Club</title>
		<content>   The Club was begun by Lord Portman  
 for his workers before the Great War  
 and has been in the present buildings 
 for 50 years; the one shilling (5p)   
 peppercorn rent is still paid for the 
 original building.                    
   Membership is limited to 1000 by the
 Parish Council. Priority is given to  
 those who have been junior members    
 since 13 (fee: 15p p.a.) and full club
 status starts at 18 (fee: Â£2 p.a. and 
 Â£5 enrolment).There is a 10p "friendly
 share" to safeguard members in the    
 event of the Club closing.            
   The Committee of nine, Chairman,    
 Secretary, Treasurer &amp; six others, is 
 elected annually. The Club is managed 
 by a steward who has his own staff.   
   Besides membership fees the Club is 
 financed by sales of drink; the pool  
 tables,juke box &amp; fruit machines help 
 ensure that the Club makes a profit.  </content>
