		<content> In 1905 Tonbridge was a small market  
 town. Rich people lived to the south  
 and north and the poorer people in the
 centre near the railway. The parade   
 was a sunken garden where vagrants    
 would hide to rob people. There were  
 no cinemas. The County Grammar school 
 began in the Technical Institute. By  
 1925 the cinema was popular and at one
 time there were four. In the High     
 Street 150 shops were privately owned.
 Industry, especially printing,        
 flourished. Cricket week on the Angel 
 ground was a highlight. House building
 in roads between Baltic and Springwell
 Roads and around Meadow Lane Estate.  
 Transport was becoming a problem. In  
 World War 2 two London schools were   
 evacuated to Tonbridge. After Dunkirk 
 troop trains stopped at Tonbridge and 
 townsfolk gave food, chocolates and   
 cigarettes. Aerial battles over town. </content>
