		<content>We play captain ball at school in the  
hall.We usually play it when it is cold
and wet outside.You need at least 6    
people in each team.You need 2 benches 
and a ball.On each bench stand the     
captains-at opposite ends of the hall. 
In front of the captains you need 2    
defenders,one midfield player and 2    
attackers.The idea is for the defenders
and the midfield player to pass the    
ball to the attackers,who try to score 
by passing the ball to the captain on  
the bench.Players are not allowed to   
touch opposing players or to run with  
the ball.At home and in the playground 
we play "It".One of us is "It" and when
that one is touched by another player, 
he has to run and try to touch someone 
else.Another game that we play at home 
is "Hide &amp; Seek".A person has to hide  
while another one has to count to      
100.Then the second person can seek.   </content>
