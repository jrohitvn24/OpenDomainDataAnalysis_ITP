		<content> Certain skills are needed to work at  
 an opencast site as many complex types
 of machinery are used .               
 One of the largest machines in use is 
 a 195B digger which has a shovel      
 capacity of 17 square yards or 12     
 tons.This machine is worked by high   
 voltage electricity which is very     
 dangerous, so the cable has to be     
 strung along the top of high poles.   
 The largest machine has just been     
 commisioned and will work on the      
 project until 1988.The RH 120C is a   
 200 ton hydraulic excavator.Each scoop
 of the bucket clears 35 tons of earth.
 The excavator,built in Germany, cost  
 Â£1.5 million and took fitters on the  
 site two months to assemble.A third   
 crane had to be brought in to fit the 
 cabin onto the tracks.                
 Roughly 800_1,000 tons of coal are    
 mined each day.                       </content>
