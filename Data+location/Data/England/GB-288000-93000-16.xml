		<content>  Today's{fashions for girls}are mainly
 skirts but I think trousers will come 
 back in. The{skirts}that are in the   
 fashion now have pleats at the bottom 
 and buttons to pin them together.     
 Quite a few girls wear cotton{trousers
 with a top which joins on to it. The  
{top}has no sleeves and the most popu- 
 lar{colours}are pink and turquoise.   
{ Fashions for boys}are 'body-popping' 
 clothes which are{track suits}with    
 hoods on them. They wear{trainers}with
 long tongues and they also double the 
 laces. The way they do this is to     
 thread the laces once and thread them 
 again over the last thread. They also 
 wear coats which look like{anoraks}but
 they are not.                         
  I like{today's fashions}because they 
 are more bright clothes. About two    
 years ago they used to be browns greys
 and blacks and they used to look dull.</content>
