		<title>15Harpenden Day Centre</title>
		<content> Visiting the Day Centre in Harpenden  
 we found comfortable rooms furnished  
 from money raised by local people.    
 It is open daily to pensioners and the
 physically handicapped who live in    
 Harpenden.   They meet for a chat over
 coffee, lunch and tea.   135 meals are
 cooked by paid kitchen staff daily.   
 The Red Cross also prepare 'Meals on  
 Wheels' for 90 people.   Apart from   
 kitchen and cleaning staff all help is
 voluntary.   A hairdresser and        
 chiropodist visit and have special    
 prices and we saw one lady having her 
 hair set.   Harpenden Library provide 
 books and many Clubs meet weekly.     
                                       
 Next to the Centre is a home for 37   
 pensioners (aged 80-84 years) built on
 land left by local 17th century       
 benefactor James Marshall.
