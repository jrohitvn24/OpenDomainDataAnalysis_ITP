		<title>02GEOGRAPHY: BROWNHILLS AREA.</title>
		<content>   The area straddles a Bunter         
 sandstone ridge on the eastern side of
 the South Staffordshire Plateau. This 
 forms a watershed rising to over 180m 
 above sea level. Drainage to the west 
 is to the River Tame whilst to the    
 east it is to the River Trent. Sand   
 and gravel quarries are found flanking
 this ridge.                           
   Geology has also affected land use  
 to the west of the ridge. This is     
 situated on the coal measures and the 
 soil is chiefly marl and clay.        
 Consequently, coalmining and brick    
 making developed.                     
   East of the ridge the Triassic      
 rocks, largely sandstone, have        
 favoured agriculture. Relatively      
 fertile soils and proximity to urban  
 areas have resulted in an emphasis on 
 intensive market gardening and cereal 
 production.                           </content>
