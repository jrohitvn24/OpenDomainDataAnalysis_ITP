		<title>04Sasha's Day.</title>
		<content> At about 8.55am I fly into the car and
 hoot at my mum.She leaves the house   
 and we rev down the school.When I get 
 there I jump out of the car and run to
 my classroom.I hang my coat and bag up
{and get out my spelling book and start
{writing out spellings for the week.On 
{Mondays we have assembly (Wednsday is 
{the only day we don't have assembly). 
{When we come back  we start the days  
  mathematics .It is usually about     
 12.00pm when we have finished the     
 first page .We go into the playground 
 and wait to be told when we can go    
 to lunch.We usually muck about.We go  
{into the playground for the last 20   
{minutes.Then we come in for a half    
{hour of almost silent reading. In the 
{afternoon we watch a "How We Used To  
{Live" programme and write something   
{about it then we put our chairs up.
