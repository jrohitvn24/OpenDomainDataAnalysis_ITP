		<content>Blakesley Hall                         
Blakesley Hall was built by Richard    
Smallbroke,a rich farmer,sometime      
between 1573 and 1590.He was also a    
merchant dealing in imported cloths and
spices.When Richard died in 1613 the   
hall passed to his grand-daughter,     
Barbara,who married,first Henry        
Deuereux,and later Ailmer Foliot of    
Pirton court near Pershore.Their son,  
Ailmer,inherited the estate.His will   
gives a good description of the        
interior of the hall and its contents. 
After the Foliots,the estate was bought
in 1684 by Henry Greswolde,Rector of   
Solihull and let to tenant farmers.In  
1899 the Greswolde family sold the     
house to Henry Donne.Two years later it
was bought by Thomas Merry who lived   
there until 1932 when it was acquired  
by the Corporation as a branch of the  
City Museums and Art Gallery.          </content>
