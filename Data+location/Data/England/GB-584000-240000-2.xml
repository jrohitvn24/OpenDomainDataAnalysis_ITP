		<content>  Suffolk County Council is divided    
into 7 district councils, Sudbury is   
governed by Babergh District Council.  
The County Council has 80 elected      
members and is re-elected every four   
years. It spent 259 million pounds     
last year on services like education   
and health which works out at 423      
pounds per person living in Suffolk.   
  The town council looks after its own 
offices, also the town hall, the       
market, car parks, public parks and    
open spaces and the streets and        
pavements.                             
  The population of Suffolk in 1984 was
612,500 and increased 28 times faster  
between 1973-83 than the population of 
England as a whole. The largest        
increase in population in this area has
been among people of retirement age.
