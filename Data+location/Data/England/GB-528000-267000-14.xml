		<title>14VILLAGE POLICEMAN,FENSTANTON</title>
		<content>    {Seven hundred years ago,}in the   
 reign of Edward 1 they introduced the 
 office of{Fenstanton Parish Constable.
 The job was underpaid and unpopular.If
 elected there would be penalties      
 for refusing to serve,so the          
 appointment was passed on from year to
 year.                                 
    {The Lord of the Manor}managed the 
 village through his steward and minor 
 offences could be handled.            
    {By the 17th century}the management
 of the village was passing from the   
 Manor court to the Vestry.{In 1728}the
 Vestry elected 2 constables,{John     
{Townesend }and {John Goodgame}but it  
 was not a profitable job.             
    {Now our Village Policeman is      
{PC BUCKINGHAM.}He lives at the Police 
 House,Conington Road, Fenstanton.He   
 has an answer phone but can also be   
 contacted at{HINCHINGBROKE.}          </content>
