		<title>04FARMING AROUND SOUTHWELL (1)</title>
		<content>  On the{farms}around Southwell you    
 will find that the main{crops}growing 
 in the fields at{harvest}time are     
 peas, potatoes, oil seed rape, wheat  
 and barley.  The two main crops       
 growing out of these are wheat and    
 barley.  Farmers grow different crops 
 in different fields each year, so as  
 not to take too many nutrients out of 
 the soil. This rotational system is   
 used all over the country, and keeps  
 the land in good condition.  For      
 example; a farmer has three fields,   
 one growing rape seed, one growing    
 wheat and the other growing barley  - 
 we will call these fields one,two and 
 three. After harvest, the crop in     
 field one is transferred to field     
 two. Field two's crop transferred to  
 field three and field three's crop    
 transferred to field one.
