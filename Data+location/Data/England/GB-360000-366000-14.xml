		<content>{MARTON PARISH COUNCIL-MARTON.         
 This local council has been in        
 existence for 91 years. It serves the 
 area known as Marton, but not, the    
 neighbouring village of Whitegate.    
   The council which consists of 7     
 elected members and a paid parish     
 clerk meets once every month in the   
 Methodist Chapel Room. They are       
 financed by a penny rate,raising about
 Â£600 per year.Expenditure,therefore,is
 low,and many schemes have to be passed
 on to Vale Royal District Council.    
   The council does, however, look     
 after roads, footpaths, vet planning  
 applications, and nurtures its        
 environment by planting trees and     
 keeping its verges tidy.It looks after
 its inhabitants by hearing their      
 problems each month and helping       
 societies like the Village Recreation 
 Room and the Old Friends Association. </content>
