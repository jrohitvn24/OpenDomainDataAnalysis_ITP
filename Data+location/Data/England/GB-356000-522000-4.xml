		<content>    Apart from the two other villages  
 the rest of the housing pattern       
 consists of widely scattered farms.   
    Cliburn is built around the cross  
 roads of the Penrith_Bolton           
 and Morland_T.Sowerby roads.It is a   
 small neat village of red sandstone   
 houses with slate roofs.There are     
 several village farms three of which  
 are working farms.Interspaced between 
 are conversions of barns,chapels      
 etc.with a few modern bungalows.      
    Gt.Strickland in the block is the  
 start of a long straggling ribbon     
 village of older limestone/sandstone  
 buildings with modern ones between    
 them.                                 
    The farms are either on the        
 roadside or joined to it by           
 tracks.They consist of a wide range of
 buildings but most were built at the  
 start of the Enclosure about 1700.    </content>
