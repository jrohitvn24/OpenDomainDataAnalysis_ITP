		<content>   Trains serve our area well. Although
 we have several stations people might 
 live two miles (3km) from the nearest.
 The busiest time is when people are   
 going to work, and the rush hour from 
 four o'clock until six o'clock.       
 Local train services are linked to the
 South Coast and London. Passengers go 
 to London to link up with the National
 network.                              
   Our area is well served with buses. 
 We have four different types;         
 double-decker red buses, which take   
 you into London; single-decker red    
 buses for around Croydon; Greenline, a
 single green bus, takes you through   
 London and Green country take you to  
 quieter places.                       
   In the rush hour buses are crowded  
 with commuters, tickets are bought on 
 the bus. There are cheap tickets for  
 children and pensioners.              </content>
