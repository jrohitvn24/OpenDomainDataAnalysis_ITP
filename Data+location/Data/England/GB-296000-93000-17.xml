		<content>{Exeter Airport.                       
 In the Airport people go to work.     
 There are a lot of different jobs like
 a Clerk,Engineer,porters,aircrew and  
 emergency services.There are a lot of 
 factories around the Airport for      
 example Sparex,Boyce and Co and       
 Revills.I like the Airport because    
 every year there is an air display.   
 Some planes fly to Spain and other    
 countries.In the past year the        
 runways were made longer and some     
 buildings were changed.This is to     
 allow bigger planes to use the        
 airport.                              
   A modern radar system has just been 
 installed.                            
   There is a Flying Club for people   
 whose hobby is flying and to teach    
 those who are interested how to fly.
