		<content> The area has a temperate{climate      
 mainly wet, warm winters and wet,     
 warmer summers                        
   Because of the height, hills and    
 close proximity to the{Atlantic}coast 
 there is a varied, localised weather  
 pattern. This brings hill mists and   
 strong gales and if the latter        
 coincides with, snowy conditions      
 the area becomes encased in drifts.   
 When the main road becomes blocked    
 with snow the village can become      
 isolated for days.This brings         
 problems, particularly to the hillside
 farmers.  However, the rescue services
 are swiftly employed and helicopters  
 drop food supplies or transport the   
 sick to hospital.  Thus, the community
 spirit which often arises out of      
 difficult situations is not unknown in
 the district &amp; children enjoy enforced
 holidays when school is inaccessible. </content>
