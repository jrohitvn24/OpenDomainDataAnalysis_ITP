		<title>17DIARY OF A CHURCHILL FAMILY</title>
		<content>  We number six in family, my husband, 
 self and four children aged six, four,
 two and five months.   Life is very   
 hectic and I have little time for     
 housework, most of my energies being  
 directed towards the children.   I    
 spend much time keeping them amused   
 and try to take them for a walk each  
 day.                                  
  I have vast piles of washing and find
 the automatic washing machine         
 invaluable.   I have very little in   
 the way of kitchen gadgets, but find a
 fridge/freezer useful.   Meals are    
 simple, the main one being taken in   
 the evening.   The family prefer fish 
 and vegetable dishes to meat.         
  Home safety includes fireguards,     
 cooker guard and a fire extinguisher. 
 Pets kept are two mongrel dogs, one   
 cat and five goldfish.
