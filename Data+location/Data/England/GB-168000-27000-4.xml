		<title>04Memorys of Boskenwyn School</title>
		<content> The school opened in 1877.From        
 1897-1900 there were approxmately 105 
 children attending Boskenwyn school.  
 The reason for this large number was  
 that children stayed on until they    
 were 14 or 15.Now in 1985 there are 55
 children.                             
   1970-present                        
     Mrs Simmonds                      
 During the time that Mrs Simmonds has 
 been here she learnt to shut her eyes 
 to"apparent chaos."                   
 Mr Rose                               
 Mr Rose was very easy to get to know  
 he was always dressed up smart and    
 wearing Italian shoes.He would send   
 children on  messages which didn't    
 make  sense.                          
   Any excuse for a party.He especially
 liked Christmas partys.
