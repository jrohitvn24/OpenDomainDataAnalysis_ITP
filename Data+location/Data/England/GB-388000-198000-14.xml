		<title>14ASTON DOWN AIRFIELD</title>
		<content> The airfield has got 12 hangars; in   
 three there are old aircraft.  There  
 is a two-mile runway.  There is a     
 Glider Club every Saturday and Sunday.
 They have just found 100 metal shells 
 there.                                
 Mr. Flowers owns one part of the old  
 runway and we own the other part of   
 it. Also there are two bomb shelters; 
 one cow has already died in one of    
 them.  In the fields they grow grass  
 and this is used for hay and sileage. 
 The only problem is that the old      
 runway can break the cutter and turner
 if you are not careful, and it costs a
 lot to repair them.  The top part of  
 the field is stone and bits of metal  
 so you cannot really mow it.
