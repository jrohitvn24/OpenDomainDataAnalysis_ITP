		<title>04Warsop Mills.</title>
		<content>  The present mill on the River Meden  
 was built in{1765}on the same site as 
 the one mentioned in the 1086 Domesday
 records.In earlier days the{mill}was  
{water}powered,grinding corn for flour.
 Mining subsidence,affecting the water 
 level of the mill dam,and later a fire
 caused the mill to fall into disuse.  
 The mill is in use today,powered by   
 electricity.The owners are basically  
 corn merchants storing flour in the   
 building,but some pet food is milled. 
                                       
  On the outskirts of Warsop,beside the
 B6035 road,is Warsop{windmill.}Built  
 in{1825,}it was originally a stone    
 tower mill with 4 patent sails and an 
 ogee cap,or onion top as it is        
 commonly known.Only the stump remains 
 now,which is derelict.
