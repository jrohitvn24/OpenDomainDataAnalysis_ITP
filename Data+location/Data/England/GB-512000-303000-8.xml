		<content> Most of the industries around the     
 Glinton and Helpston area are Service 
 Industries.These contain things such  
 as food shops,post offices and motor  
 services.There are two post offices in
 the area,The one in Glinton is run by 
 Mr. and Mrs Kernick.Our local motor   
 service is near Arthur Mellows Village
 College.It is called Sycamore,this    
 sells B.M.W cars and petrol.Another   
 garage is Mr. Olivers he also sells   
 second hand cars and petrol.Most of   
 the industries are food shops.The     
 nearest one to the Primary School is a
 shop owned by Mrs.Sheffield.This sells
 almost everything.The post offices    
 both sell food.On High Sreet there is 
 yet another food shop.This one is     
 rather like Mrs Sheffields.Another    
 type of industry is the manufacturing 
 industry.In Helpston there is a paper 
 mill.This sells paper and books too.  </content>
