		<title>17MINING IN ESTON HILLS</title>
		<content> On our{explorations}of the area we    
 found{evidence}of the{mining industry 
 which used to take place here.There   
 are several{ruined buildings}and we   
 also found three blocked off{tunnels  
 leading into the hillside.Two of these
 were quite large,rather like{railway  
{tunnels.}The mines were{ironstone     
 mines.                                
  We noticed that in many of the       
{streams}the water and mud was an      
{orangey colour.}This is caused by the 
 ironstone in the hills.Also you can   
 see places where the land has{subsided
 due to the mining.                    
  When the{mines}first opened in the   
 early{1900's}people came from all over
 the country to work here.             
  To get to work the men had to climb  
 up{Eston Hills}because the cage they  
 went down in was at a place called{Pit
{Top or Barnaby Moor.                  </content>
