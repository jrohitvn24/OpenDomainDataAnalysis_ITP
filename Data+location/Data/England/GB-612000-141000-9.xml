		<title>09Longage Farm: dairy changes</title>
		<content> Until six years ago Mr Ridley-Day was 
 a dairy farmer with a herd of Guernsey
 cows. Guernsey cows give rich creamy  
 milk and as people became more aware  
 of the effects of cholesterol in such 
 milk the demand for his milk lessened 
 and he was forced to stop dairy       
 farming. The EEC encouraged dairy     
 farmers to stop producing milk and he 
 sold his herd to the government.      
 Unfortunately the whole herd had to be
 destroyed. A dairy herd consists of   
 many cows in order to get a lot of    
 milk. Cows are milked two or three    
 times a day. Modern dairy methods make
 it possible for milk, cream, butter   
 and cheese to be produced cheaply.    
 Todays milking machines are highly    
 efficient, hygenic and easy to        
 operate. The EEC have introduced milk 
 quotas to reduce the amount of milk   
 produced.                             </content>
