		<title>14SCHOOL AS IT IS TODAY.</title>
		<content>{The classrooms}are 3 wooden huts.There
 are 38 lockers and 28 pupils in our   
 class. The classrooms are a bit       
 cramped. There are about 90 children  
 in the whole school. The tables are   
 grouped in 2's,4's and 6's.           
{From the fence}of the school playing- 
 field I can see 8 different buildings.
 Three classrooms,the school hall, the 
 caretakers house, the pottery shed, 1 
 garden shed and 2 houses. {           
{From the lawn}I can see 12 chimneys   
 and a weather vane on the roofs.The   
 school is in a pleasant spot with a   
 playing-field, a tarmac covered play- 
 ground, a lawn with a picnic table, a 
 caretakers garden and flower border.  
 We have 2 cooks and 2 dinner ladies.  
{I enjoyed}this school because it has a
 happy atmosphere.
