		<title>04Tegsnose Country Park</title>
		<content> Tegsnose Country Park is above the    
 village of Langley.I think it looks   
 like a sheep's nose,and teg is said   
 to be a local name for a sheep.       
 Part of Tegsnose has been cut away    
 because it was quarried by the        
 Wettons until 1920                    
 There are two ways that I can get to  
 Tegsnose. I can walk through Tegsnose 
 Wood or by car which can be parked in 
 the large carparks.You can buy        
 books,refreshments and given help by  
 the National Park Ranger who is       
 usually there.It has good views from  
 the top of all Cheshire and many      
 visitors come from far away.          
 There are not many trees on Tegsnose  
 but there are lots of birds,plants and
 flowers and people come to pick wild  
 fruits.A stone building is there and  
 in it you can see how the stone was   
 quarried long ago.                    </content>
