		<title>01Rolvenden : A General Review</title>
		<content>   This area takes in the villages of  
{Rolvenden and Rolvenden Layne}and is  
 mainly rural in character.  The       
 nearest town is Tenterden, 3 miles to 
 the north-east, on the main A28       
 (Hastings to Ashford) road.           
   Running from north to south across  
 the area is Newmill Channel, which is 
 a tributary of the River Rother. This 
 low-lying area of marshland has been  
 drained more and more in recent years.
   About 1,200 people live here and    
 about 60% work in agriculture.        
{  Rolvenden}has a County Primary      
 School, a Church, a Village Hall and  
 Recreation Ground. There is a Post    
 Office, convenience goods shops, a    
 garage and 2 public houses.{Rolvenden 
{Layne}has fewer facilities but it does
 have a pub, Post Office, shop and     
 playing field. Rolvenden was judged   
 the Best Kept Village in Kent in l985.</content>
