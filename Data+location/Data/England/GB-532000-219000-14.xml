		<title>14A TYPICAL DAY IN DANE END</title>
		<content>{A DAY IN MY LIFE:}Every morning I     
 get up at 6:45 I have a wash and get  
 dressed. Then I go down stairs to see 
 my puppy called Bennett I let him out 
 into the garden and make his          
 breakfast. I also give my cat some    
 munchies. They are like tiny flavoured
 biscuits. Then I make my own breakfast
 and either listen to the radio or     
 watch the tv. My Mum and Dad get up   
 and come down stairs and have their   
 breakfast and Mummy makes our packed  
 lunches. Sophie, Marcus and Luke have 
 their breakfast as well.              
 We say  good-bye to Mum and Luke and  
 Daddy takes us to school. At school   
 our subjects are English, Mathematics,
 Art and Craft, Geography, French,     
 Science, Handwriting and Reading. Our 
 lunch break is at 12noon.We go home at
 3pm.After school I usually play with  
 my friends and go to bed at 8.30 pm.  </content>
