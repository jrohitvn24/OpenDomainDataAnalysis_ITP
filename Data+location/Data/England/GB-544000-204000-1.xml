		<title>01THORNWOOD AND RYE HILL</title>
		<content> The are is just South of Harlow New   
 Town,and slopes gently southwards from
{Rye Hill}at 112m.Farmland is expensive
 -about five thousand pounds a hectare 
 though building land costs still more.
 The {Soil Survey}grades the clay soil 
 as {2}Few limits on crops.Most crops  
 can be grown:the soil holds fertiliser
 well,though fruit and potatoes grow   
 better with some summer irrigation.   
 From the air in early June,the area is
 splashed with large yellow rape fields
 the same amount of light green barley 
 and a few darker wheat fields.The few 
 hedges are dotted with mature trees   
 and there are thickets and copses in  
 odd corners.The only houses are along 
 the Epping-Harlow road,in Thornwood or
 the tiny village of Epping Upland,or  
 the dozen farms with their cottages,  
 scattered round the area.             
 Thornwood has the few small industries</content>
