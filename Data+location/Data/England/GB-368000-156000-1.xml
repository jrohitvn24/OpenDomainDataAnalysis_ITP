		<title>01GENERAL INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content> The area is mainly rural with one     
 large village, Peasedown St John,     
 (population approx. 4000) surrounded  
 by three smaller villages, Shoscombe  
 to S.E., Camerton to W. and           
 Carlingcott to N.W. The three smaller 
 villages are all mentioned in the     
 original Domesday Book. Peasedown     
 origanally got its name for being the 
 place they grew peas. The town        
 developed as a result of coal mining, 
 being surrounded by pits. The Roman   
 Road "The Fosse Way" (now the A367)   
 diagonally bisects the block and is   
 the main commuter route to Bath. Apart
 from farming there is very little     
 local employment, so the majority of  
 the working population commute to     
 Bristol or Bath.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
