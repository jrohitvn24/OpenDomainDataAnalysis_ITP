		<title>13Birdlife Around Nantwich.</title>
		<content>   The land,streams and river in the   
 area encourage an abundance of{bird   
{life}found throughout the year.The    
 summer brings its swallows, moose and 
 sand martins and swifts, all of which 
 breed in the area.The river attracts  
 the cormorants, kingfisher, sandpipers
 to its sandy banks and the lesser     
 white throat has been seen in the     
 leafy lanes.The kestral and sparrow   
 hawk hover above their prey by day    
 whilst dusk brings out the tawny owl, 
 barn owl and little owl.{Reptiles}and 
 amphibians are not that easy to find. 
 Farmers are draining ponds and low    
 lying damp areas thus reducing the    
 breeding places however frog, toad and
 newts are still to be found breeding  
 and the crested newt is still to be   
 found in the vicinity of the local    
 agricultural college, and the grass   
 snake is the only reptile sited.      </content>
