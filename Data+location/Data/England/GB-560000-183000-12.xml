		<content>   Lisa and I asked people in our      
 village questions about the{pets}they 
 keep but we only went to the people we
 knew.                                 
   We asked them many questions, such  
 as{how many}pets they have,{what kind 
{of}pets they are and so on. We found  
 out that the average number of pets to
 own is about three. Their ages vary   
 from{2 months to 13}years.            
   They are mostly dogs, rabbits, cats 
 and rodents. The{exercise}they are    
 given varies, from some remaining in a
 cage whilst others are taken for long 
 walks.                                
   The pets were mostly{female}and most
 of them had{nicknames}such as Mrs.    
 White, Mr. Brown, Pip and so on.      
   There was hardly anyone who did not 
 own a pet. Pets are popular, probably 
 because we live in a village where    
 there is a lot of open space.         </content>
