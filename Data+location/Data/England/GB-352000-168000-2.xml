		<title>02LONG ASHTON BY-PASS</title>
		<content> The Long Ashton by-pass is a fast,    
 direct road. It leads to the centre of
 Bristol from the village of Flax      
 Bourton, and was built in 1969. The   
 village of Long Ashton is now much    
 safer and less busy. During the       
 rush-hour, before the by-pass was     
 built, traffic queues stretched out   
 from Bristol city centre, through Long
 Ashton , to Nailsea, a distance of    
 seven or eight miles. If you had to   
 travel through Long Ashton, you had to
 allow an extra half hour because the  
 traffic was so bad. There were many   
 accidents because of the traffic      
 jams.There were many more accidents   
 than now on the main road at the      
 western end of the village, involving 
 children being knocked down on their  
 way to school.
