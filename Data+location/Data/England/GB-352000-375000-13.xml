		<title>13FRODSHAM HILL RACES</title>
		<content>                                       
  The hill races as we know them today 
 were started in 1970 as part of       
 carnival week and have proved to be   
 one of the most succcesful events of  
 this type. The races have attracted   
 athletes from all parts of the        
 country, including famous names like  
 Sebastian Coe who competed as a 12    
 year old in 1972.                     
 Records show that hill races have been
 held in Frodsham for over 100 years   
 and, after lapsing, they have been    
 revived from time to time. In 1980 a  
 ladies' race was introduced for the   
 first time. The Senior Men's race     
 involves 3 hill circuits and a total  
 of over 1000 feet in climbing.
