		<title>01General Description of Block</title>
		<content>   Our 4km x 3km block, number 03960312
is situated in Staffordshire on the    
edge of Cannock Chase.   It contains   
parts of Chadsmoor, Pye Green, Hednes- 
ford and Huntington which are all admin
-istered by Cannock Urban District Coun
-cil.   The whole area is dominated by 
the Post Office telecommunications tow-
er situated at Pye Green.   Huntington 
is the site of one of the two remaining
deep coal mines which are all that is  
left of the Cannock Chase Coalfield.   
There is little light industry in the  
block, and the land is divided almost  
equally between housing, farming and   
the coniferous woods and open spaces of
Cannock Chase.   Stafford lies to the  
North beyond Cannock Chase with its    
coniferous plantations and open heath  
land, while to the South lies the      
Wolverhampton conurbation.
