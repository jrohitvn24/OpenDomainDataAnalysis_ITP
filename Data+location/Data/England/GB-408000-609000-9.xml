		<content> The Church of St John the Baptist     
 stands on a hill overlooking the      
 castle and the old village. It is a   
 typical small country church mostly of
 Norman architecture, but possibly some
 small remains of an Anglo-Saxon wall  
 and a little post Norman work. The    
 tower was built in the 14th C. It is  
 still open as a church with services  
 twice a month, but rather a sparse    
 congregation. It is combined with the 
 small Bolton Chapel 3 miles to the    
 north and shares a Vicar with the     
 Parish of Whittingham 4 miles to the  
 west.                                 
 The ruins of the castle and the Solar 
 tower have been made safe, part of the
 old walls have been rebuilt and in    
 1986 it will be open to the public.
