Some of the businesses described in 1986 no longer exist but others continue.  At Slapewath the business that was buying and selling commercial vehicles is now primarily involved in earth moving equipment, renting and selling both new and used.  Another company breaks down old cars and sells spare parts.  Two coach companies are based in the area, one at Slapewath and one at Margrove Park, providing school buses and coaches for excursions.  The former filling station on the lower slope of Birk Brow now only sells second hand cars, specialising in those with low mileage.&lt;br />&lt;br />Businesses at Charltons, on the site of the old mine stables, sell garden sheds and angling equipment.  A mobile cafe is based there and is moved each day to the car park at the top of Birk Brow Hill to provide hot drinks and other refreshments for motorists including lorry drivers. &lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
