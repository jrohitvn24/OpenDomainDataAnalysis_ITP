{Hereford and Worcster County Council  
 for its schools.  All local schools   
 are maintained by the County and staff

 writing a bitter dispute is raging    
 about teacher's pay which is          
 disrupting schools and causing        
 problems for both pupils and parents.

 First, Middle and High Schools.       
 Pershore is served by four schools. { 
{Abbey Park first and Middle and Cherry
