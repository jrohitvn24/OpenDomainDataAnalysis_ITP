		<title>19Wingate - Refuse Disposal</title>
		<content>    One mile North of Wingate at       
 Thornley Station a new refuse disposal
 plant has been constructed.           
    In the past, disused limestone     
 quarries and clay pits have be        
 gradually filled in with refuse and   
 covered with top soil and returned to 
 their natural state for farming and   
 grazing.                              
    Now there are no more old quarries 
 to use for this purpose and a new     
 solution was needed.                  
    The buildings are of a very modern 
 design, one being in the shape of a   
 pyramid.( Is that modern? ).          
    The others are large and           
 rectangular. The plant is able to     
 incinerate the refuse from a large    
 area and surprisingly there is no     
 smoke and there are no smells.
