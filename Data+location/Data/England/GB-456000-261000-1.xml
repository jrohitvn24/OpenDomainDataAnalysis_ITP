100 people shopping in Daventry from   
June 18 to 20 1985 were questioned.    
                                       
1) How do you rate Daventry as a       
shopping centre?                       
       Very good    12%                
       Good         24%                
       Satisfactory 42%                
       Poor         12%                
       Very poor    10%                
COMMENT                                
 Those people satisfied with the       
shopping facilities outweighed those   
who were not by more than 3 to 1       
(78% to 22%). Only 1 in 10 of those    
questioned thought that the facilities 
were very poor. We thought more people 
would be dissatisfied because many of  
our parents grumble about Daventry as a
shopping centre.
