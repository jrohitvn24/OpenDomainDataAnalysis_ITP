		<title>11Pets in Nether &amp; Over Silton</title>
		<content> Of those families surveyed only 20%   
 did not possess a pet of some kind.   
 Dogs and cats made up the most popular
 group,some of these being pedigree    
 animals.One family kept German        
 Shorthaired Pointer dogs and another  
 Burmese cats.Some dogs were kept to   
 work e.g.sheepdogs and some for       
 companionship.                        
 Goldfish made up a popular group being
 kept mainly by children.              
 We found individual households had    
 amongst them a rabbit,a duck,a        
 tortoise,a goat and a budgerigar.     
 Tortoises are becoming increasingly   
 rare as importing them into the       
 country has been banned.              
 One family had just lost a goldfinch  
 which they had kept for 15 years.     
 Three families kept ponies.
