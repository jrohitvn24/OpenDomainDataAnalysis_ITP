		<content>    As we have said, most of the area  
 allotted to our school is farm land   
 this includes grazing pasture for     
 sheep,cattle and horses.There is also 
 a variety of cereal and root crops.   
    This farm land is owned by a large 
 collection of small farms.A typical   
 example of one of these is Clayhill   
 Farm.Their land covers approximately  
 sixty acres.The main crop is potatoes 
 though they also grow fodder for their
 animals, as livestock is their        
 principle source of income.They have  
 seventy sheep and twenty cattle which,
 they sell at the Rugby Market.All the 
 work is done by the farmer except     
 during harvest when casual workers are
 temporarily employed.                 
    This, as we have said, is only on  
 of many similar farms in our area.
