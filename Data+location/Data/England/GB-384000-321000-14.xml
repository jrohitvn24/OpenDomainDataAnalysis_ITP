The  Hand and Cleaver was built in  the
late sixteenth century and started as a
farm.  The  owners brewer beer  and  it
became known as the local ale-house. It
is now a very popular public house with
a  very  good  local  reputation  as  a
restaurant.   The  owner,  Mr   Slater,
employs twenty-four staff, two of  whom
are  chefs. The regular customers  come
from  about  a ten  mile  radius  while
restaurant customers come from  further
afield.                                
The name of the pub stems from the time
when  the place was a farm. One of  the
owners  used  to slaughter  his  cattle
with a cleaver.
