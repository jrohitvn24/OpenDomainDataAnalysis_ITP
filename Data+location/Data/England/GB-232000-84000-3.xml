 films,shops,cottages,a lodging house  
 frequented by tramps and the town     
 library(now flats).In the last15years,
 Tower Street's chapel,{cottages}and   
 shops have been replaced by warden_   
 controlled flats.The{Walk house}car   
 park has replaced the lovely house    
 that stood near the old town wall.    
 Another car park occupies the area    
 where{Castle Street}houses were.In    
 the Castle Green, there are no        
 longer swings and see_saws where      
 children played and watched bonfires  
 and circuses.For many years,          
 archaeologists have been excavating   
 this area.Other modern town buildings 
 are the dentists' surgery,Tax offices,
 the library in Madford Lane and the   
 Fire Station in Westgate Street.The
