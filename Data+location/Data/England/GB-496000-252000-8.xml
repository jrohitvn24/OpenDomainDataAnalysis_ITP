		<title>08Eating Habits in Stevington</title>
		<content> The media and travel have introduced a
 foreign flavour to our foods but the  
 main influence is still the family,its
 age range and occupations.Travel is   
 involved whether to work or school    
 therefore a midday meal at home,      
 certainly on weekdays,is out of the   
 question.This means taking a packed   
 lunch or having a canteen meal and    
 makes the evening meal the most       
 substantial one of the day.Breakfast  
 tends to be quick and easy; cereal,   
 toast,tea or coffee.People at home all
 day may still follow the traditional  
 cooked breakfast,dinner,tea and supper
 routine.Commodities used are home     
 produced or purchased.Milk is         
 delivered daily and the village shop  
 provides everyday requirements.Cooking
 is either traditional using           
 electricity,calor gas,oil or solid    
 fuel or microwave for speed.          </content>
