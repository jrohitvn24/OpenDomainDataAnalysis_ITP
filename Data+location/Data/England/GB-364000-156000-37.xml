We have enjoyed taking part in this project and looking at the lives of people in our village. It has been great to interview and work with people we wouldn't normally have to chance to. We have used digital cameras and computers during most aspects of this project that children in 1985 would have found amazing. Many thanks to everyone who has helped us put all the information together and given their time to work with us.&lt;br />&lt;br />The Year 5 class of 2011, St. Mary's CoE Primary School, Timsbury.  &lt;br />
