		<title>05The Sewage Works, Hailsham</title>
		<content> Hailsham is growing &amp; to accommodate  
 the extra housing the sewage works,   
 originally commissioned in 1974, has  
 since been nearly rebuilt by frequent 
 updating. Sewage is treated by the    
 activated sludge process. It also     
 serves Hellingly &amp; The Dickers as well
 as Hailsham with a total population of
 14,000. Southern Water Authority are  
 ultimately responsible to the Dept. of
 Environment. Farm Houses are on main  
 drainage. There are 2 sewerage systems
 flowing through the area. One is via  
 embanked waterways - dykes - called   
 Harebeating Stream &amp; Hurst Haven which
 carry surface water drainage &amp; treated
 effluent. Average pump drain level is 
 1.7m. The other is the dirty water    
 sewerage carried to a treatment plant.
 Average pump drain level is 0.6m.     
 These waterways, after treatment, are 
 carried to Pevensey Levels.           </content>
