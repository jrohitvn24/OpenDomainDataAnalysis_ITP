		<title>17A DAY IN THE LIFE OF ALAN</title>
		<content>The day starts at 4.00am for my dad. He
gets up, has his breakfast and he has  
to be at work by 5.00am. He is a       
postman. When he gets there he has to  
sort the letters into the right        
deliveries, he sorts 1500 letters an   
hour. When all the letters have been   
sorted they are put in the streets and 
villages in numerical order. The       
postman always puts his own letters and
parcels into the van for his round.    
They leave the post office at 7.00am   
and my dad delivers about 3000 letters 
in Thundridge. The round ends at 12.00 
noon with the collection of mail from  
the boxes. His day is then over at     
work.                                  
There are three rounds which each      
postman works on in turn. This means   
that once every three weeks Dad        
delivers our post. They are all village
deliveries so they are all done by van.</content>
