		<title>09THE CYCLE SHOP IN BURWELL.</title>
		<content>{Hunter's cycle shop}is opposite       
 Burwell House.It used to be a         
 butcher's shop until Mr Hunter moved  
 in. He then decided that we needed a  
 cycle-shop so he turned it into       
 one.The building is very old and made 
 of clunch.You can buy{old and new     
{bikes.                                
 On warm days you will see all the old 
 cycles that the owner is mending and  
 selling.You can also see Mr Hunter    
 himself sitting outside repairing     
 them.He enjoys a chat and is often    
 spotted cycling in the surrounding    
 country-side.
