		<title>11Southleigh Estate</title>
		<content>  The farmland administered by the     
 Southleigh estate trust in this area  
 is permenent grassland let on         
 grazing agreements to others.         
  The woodland area has gravel hoggin  
 underneath and the corner adjacent to 
 Horndean Rd and N.of Emsworth Common  
 Rd is at present being quarried by    
 Butser Lime Works. There is a planning
 obligation that when the quarrying is 
 complete,the land is replanted and    
 restored to forestry. The woodland is 
 mainly oak with some chestnut.        
  The southleigh Trust is gradually    
 easing out of business in this area   
 and consolidating all interests in the
 Clanfield area in the estate of the   
 major land owners.They would like to  
 sell their woodland to the local      
 Authority for a recreation area as    
 forestry is no longer economical.
