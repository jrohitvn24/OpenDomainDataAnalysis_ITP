		<title>05BRADNOP'S MEETING HALL.</title>
		<content>     The village of Bradnop has a      
disused school building in the centre  
which is now used as a meeting place.  
I, Stephen Robinson, used to be a pupil
at the school until it was closed down 
in l978.  We all tried to save the     
school by raising money and making a   
nationwide television appeal. However, 
we were unsuccessful.                  
     The building has two rooms which  
are sometimes used for parish meetings 
and whist drives. On a regular, weekly 
basis the building is used for a Youth 
Club.                                  
     The Youth Club has pool and       
snooker facilities. It is run by David 
Taylor a local teacher. The club is    
open from 8.00pm.-10.00pm. every Friday
evening. It is hoped that some trips   
can be arranged to local places of     
interest eg. Alton Towers.
