		<content> The area is within the Green Belt but 
{council houses}have been built in{Mill
{Bank}and{private houses in Cragg Vale.
 Many say that they spoil the rural    
 appearance and character of the area. 
 Many{derelict farms}have been bought  
 at inflated prices by outsiders to the
 detriment of local people.Many of     
 these commute to their work in the    
 industrial areas adjoining.The{Bus    
{Services}in Cragg Vale &amp; Mill Bank are
 restricted and because of their lack  
 of use could be cut further.There is  
 increased traffic in both villages    
 because they are near the M62. This is
 especially so in Cragg Vale where the 
 road has recently been re-surfaced    
 causing increased speed which is      
 particularly dangerous owing to       
 the many bends and narrowness.
