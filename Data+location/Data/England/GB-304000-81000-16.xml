		<title>16Normans Stores in Salterton</title>
		<content> Normans Cash and Carry store is an    
 important part of the shopping        
 facility in Budleigh Salterton.It was 
 founded in 1952 by Mr Norman and has  
 been an increasing busines ever since.
 Normans buy food from nearly every    
 country in the world.They sell        
 groceries,meat,fruit,clothes and hard 
 ware.Their busiest time is in         
 November when people are stocking up  
 for Christmas.Most people from a      
 fifteen miles radius of Salterton go  
 to Normans about once a week.         
 The Salterton branch is the main one  
 but there are 18 other branches.They  
 do not open on Sundays because it is  
 against the law but they would if they
 could.                                
 180 people are employed at Normans,   
 including handicapped people.If the   
 Salterton branch closed there would be
 a lot more unemployed.                </content>
