		<title>07Arable Farming -Farlesthorpe</title>
		<content>    The farmer has run a 164 acre farm 
 in Farlesthorpe for 18 years.  It was 
 owned at first by the John Spendluffe 
 school and it was then given to the   
 Grammar school in Alford in the 17th  
 century.                              
    The farm is predominantly arable,  
 growing wheat (100 acres), potatoes,  
 barley, and oil seed rape (all 20     
 acres). The remaining 4 acres is taken
 up by roads, hedges and buildings.    
 The land is fertile but fertiliser    
 still has to be purchased in order to 
 improve the land.  The farm is very   
 mechanised; the farmer owns all his   
 own equipment - even combine          
 harvesters.                           
    Even so, the farm still has to     
 employ 4 or 5 men or schoolboys in the
 summer months to act as casual        
 labourers.
