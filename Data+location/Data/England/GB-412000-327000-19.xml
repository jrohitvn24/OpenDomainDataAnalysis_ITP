		<title>19Traction engine club</title>
		<content> The{North Staffordshire and Cheshire  
{Traction Engine club}is based at      
{Klondyke Mill}in Draycott in the      
 Clay. The members own their own       
 engines and maintain them on the club 
 premises.                             
                                       
 Every year the club organises a very  
 successful{bonfire and fireworks      
 display to celebrate Guy Fawkes night.
 The club also holds an "open day"     
 twice a year, which is popular with   
 the local dads as well as their       
 children.                             
                                       
 The site was formerly a brick works   
 and later a plaster and cement mill.  
 An embankment is all that remains of  
 the track on which horses once pulled 
 alabaster from the{Draycott mine}to be
 turned into plaster.
