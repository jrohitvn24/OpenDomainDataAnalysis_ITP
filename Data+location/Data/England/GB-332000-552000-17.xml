		<content> There are several people still living 
 in the village who have spent all or  
 most of their lives in the community. 
 Talking to them, we learn what village
 life was like 50 years ago. It was a  
 quiet, peaceful place with very little
 traffic, except the horse and cart.   
 Skating on the village pond in winter;
 giving a live goose to the headmaster 
 for his Christmas present; playing    
 truant from school to go potato       
 picking; annual sports days - were    
 some customs. Many people are recent  
 residents, having come within the last
 20 years. Most are commuters to       
 Carlisle or Wigton. But there are     
 quite a number of senior citizens too,
 who have come to the village to spend 
 their retirement. The majority of     
 people take quite an active part in   
 the village activities.The area has no
 local policeman, sharing with Thursley</content>
