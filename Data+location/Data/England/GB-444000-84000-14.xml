		<title>14"Bowcombe"-Transport Changes</title>
		<content>   Several of the older inhabitants    
 remember when the first car came to   
 the area. One man remembers quite     
 clearly that it was a Model T Ford.   
 "The second was a bull-nosed Morris.  
 Then there was a third and everybody  
 was terrified that there would be a   
 collision!" That was 50 years ago. Now
 everybody has a car. It is no longer a
 luxury. The private car has multiplied
 at the expense of public transport.   
 There is just one bus service through 
 the area, which is mainly used by     
 tourists.                             
   On the land, four wheel drive       
 vehicles, tractors, and combine       
 harvesters, and lately, more          
 speciallised vehicles such as motor   
 tricycles, have replaced the old horse
 drawn wagons, stationary steam        
 engines, and threshers.
