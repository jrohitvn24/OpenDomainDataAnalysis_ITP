		<content>{BARNTON AND LITTLE LEIGH 03600375}    
 The area is mainly rural being a      
 mixture of arable and dairy farming   
 However it is overshadowed by the     
 factory from which sprang the modern  
 day ICI across the river in Northwich.
 Our two villages are almost the       
 complete opposite of each other in    
 character but are linked physically by
 the Weaver Navigation and the Runcorn 
 Road.Little Leigh is a small scattered
 community centred round the church and
 surrounded by farmland.Barnton is one 
 of the largest villages in England    
 with correspondingly better public    
 facilities.Originating at either end  
 of the Trent and Mersey Canal Tunnel, 
 it developed in stages the most recent
 being a large Council estate housing  
 workers from a then expanding ICI and 
 a smaller private estate.
