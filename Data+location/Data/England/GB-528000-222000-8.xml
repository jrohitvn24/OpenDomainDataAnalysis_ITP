		<title>08BENINGTON CASTLE (1)</title>
		<content>One of the features of Benington is the
castle known as The Lordship and its   
gardens.                               
The present Lordship is a Queen Anne   
period house built upon the remains of 
an ancient castle and surrounded by    
outstandingly beautiful gardens.       
The original site dates back to Saxon  
times. In 850, Berthulf, King of Mercia
is mentioned as having his palace at   
Benington. The remains of the mound    
still exist and upon it the evidence of
the foundations and keep of a later    
Norman castle replacing the earlier    
wooden tower.                          
In 1213 Benington Castle was destroyed 
by King John and the owner Robert Fitz 
Walter outlawed. The site was often re-
developed in subsequent years and the  
doings of many owners are recorded in  
history. (Cont.)
