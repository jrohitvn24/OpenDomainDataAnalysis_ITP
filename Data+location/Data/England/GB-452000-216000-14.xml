		<title>14Public Houses in Weston</title>
		<content> Weston has 2 pubs, both owned by Halls
 Brewery.  Both were built circa 1500  
 and are interesting examples of local 
 vernacular architecture. Stone built  
 with low beamed ceilings the Ben      
 Jonson and the Chequers (which is     
 thatched) exude the atmosphere of the 
 traditional English country pub.      
                                       
 The Ben Jonson has 2 bars and serves  
 traditional ales and pub food.  Most  
 of its patrons are local people and   
 include the Haywain Club and Weston   
 Football team.  Darts, Pool and Aunt  
 Sally are popular games in the pub.   
                                       
 The Chequers has 2 bars and a beer    
 garden. It serves food and traditional
 ales to a mainly passing trade.  A    
 family room is available for over-    
 night visitors. Pool and darts are    
 played in the public bar.             </content>
