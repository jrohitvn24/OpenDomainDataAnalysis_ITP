 The last Pot Fair and Greasy Pole     
 Ceremony was held about 85 years ago. 
 The challenge was to climb the Pole   
 which had been greased with Ham and a 
 Brass Kettle was placed on the top.   
 The challenger had to reach both the  
 Ham and the Kettle. The last known    
 ascender was Adam Holt in 1900.       
 The Pole now standing is not the      
 original, that blew down in a gale.   
 The Pole fell into the Bay Horse Inn  
 and the Brass Cock off the top was    
 found later and given to the Post     
 Office nearby, they lent the original 
 cock to the Church during their       
 centenary celebrations.
