		<title>07THE TOLLESBURY RAILWAY</title>
		<content>      The railway from{Kelvedon}to     
{Tollesbury}used to branch off the main
 line just north east of Kelvedon      
 Station.It followed the route of the  
 present Marshall Close,and crossed    
 Driffield Close.Big jams built up     
 where it crossed Feering Hill,because 
 the guard had to open the gates       
 himself.Then was a small station      
 called{Feering Halt.}A branch went    
 into the Threshleford's Fruit Farm to 
 collect fruit and seeds.There was also
 a branch,in{Tiptree,}into the Wilkin's
 Jam Factory.The railway is now closed,
 but the old platform is still just    
 visible,and houses mark the route.    
 A bit of the old rail is now a kerb up
 to the station.The railway used to be 
 called the{'Crab and Winkle Line.'
