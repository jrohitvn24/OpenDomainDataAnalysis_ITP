		<title>08Halewood Shopping Survey</title>
		<content>    Forty families were questioned     
 about their shopping habits.          
    Most people go shopping daily in   
 our area, but a quarter only go       
 shopping once a week There were no set
 times that people went to the shops.  
    Everybody we questioned used the   
 local shops at some time or other,    
 mainly for basic foodstuffs. All the  
 people concerned also travelled out of
 Halewood to do shopping.              
    There were a number of complaints  
 about the local shops. The price of   
 goods was a main complaint because of 
 a lack of competition. Discourteous   
 staff and dirty premises also caused  
 complaints. Only six people had no    
 complaints at all.                    
    Certain types of shops were thought
 to be needed. These were supermarkets,
 a shoe shop, a D.I.Y. shop, decent    
 clothes shops and a market.           </content>
