		<content> The village sits in the middle with   
 the surrounding ground generally flat 
 and covered in rich, fertile soil. The
 main occupation therefore is          
 agricultural, work being on the many  
 small holdings, fruit farms (apples,  
 pears and soft fruit) and arable      
 farms.                                
 The population is approx 600. A small 
 typical village school with 72 pupils 
 age 5-11+ serves the area. A recent   
 baby boom has increased the young     
 population.                           
 A village hall is used by many        
 villagers belonging to the            
 organisations flourishing here. Behind
 the hall and school is a recreation   
 ground with swing and slides and also 
 cricket and football pitches.         
 The area is fortunate to have a       
 general village store, a post office  
 and a butchers shop. So many villages </content>
