{                                      
 The post office workers get about Â£101
 per week. They collect letters from   
 about 35 post boxes in Stortford.     
 About 20,000 letters go through the   
 P.O. in one day.Postmen have to be up 
 at about 5 am to get to the post      
 office early to sort the mail. One    
 postman can deliver letters in up to  
 six streets. They finish work at      
 lunchtime and only have Sundays off.  
 To be a postman you have to be fit    
 because you get lots of exercise. He  
 hates his job in the ice and snow     
 because he gets very cold. One lady   
 had been working for the post office  
 for 19 years.Most postmen enjoy the   
 open air as they deliver letters on a 
 bike. A postman called Brian was      
 attacked by a dog when he was         
 delivering a letter.                  </content>
