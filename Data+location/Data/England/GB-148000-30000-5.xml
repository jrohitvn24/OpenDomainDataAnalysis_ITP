		<content> This is a small school with 4 classes.
 It was built in 1901 and extended in  
 1979. The pupils ages range from 4 to 
 11 years. There are 108 pupils, 4     
 teachers, including the headmistress, 
 2 part-time teachers, and 1 secretary.
 We have two school cooks, two cleaners
 and a caretaker.                      
 As well as our usual lessons we have  
 Music, Drama, Art and Craft and       
 sometimes we do cookery. Games include
 rounders, tower-ball and football. We 
 go swimming at a local pool. In July  
 there is Sports and Open Day. At      
 Christmas we have parties, and we     
 perform a play for our parents.       
 We have a school garden and a playing 
 field. There is a library. The younger
 infants have a play area. Parents help
 with cookery, gardening, swimming and 
 other activities.
