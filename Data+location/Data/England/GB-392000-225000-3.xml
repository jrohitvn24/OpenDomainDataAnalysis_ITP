 farm. It was built in 1968 and so is  
 the newest farm we visited. They have 
 14 acres divided into two fields. At  
 the last count they had 900 pigs. On  
 average they work 10 hours aday from  
 7.30 am to about 5.30 pm. There are   
 100 breeding sows, 5 boars,the rest   
 are the offspring. They feed the pigs 
 on pig nuts using 7 tons a week.      
 The pigs live in sheds in warm        
 darkness.Some of the piglets are given
 special powdered milk as the sow can't
 feed them.They make 1,000 bales of hay
 most of which they sell.A fattened pig
 weighs 50 kilos and sells for Â£60.Mr  
 and Mrs Cherry have lived on this farm
 for 7 years.Before they owned a farm  
 in Western-Super-Mare.They own a muck 
 spreader and a slurry tanker.
