		<content> The dam of{Great Lodge}was removed by 
 the North West Water Authority in     
 1984. Today the site looks like a     
 dried-up lake bed. It was constructed 
 about 1840 by John Haworth, a farmer, 
 who together with the Ashworths and   
 Ramsbottoms had developed the mills in
 the Cheesden Valley some years        
 earlier. Great Lodge was built to     
 overcome the problem of an irregular  
 flow of water and provided a valuable 
 service in regulating the work of the 
 mills, by the use of sluice gates.    
 With the decline of the textile mills 
 in the 20th Centuary the need for this
 service has disappeared, and so the   
 former Lodge remains as a dried-up    
 reservoir at present.
