		<title>15Rising Brook &amp; Moss Pit.</title>
		<content>  This area is situated just off the M6
motorway about a mile from Stafford    
town centre.  Most of it is residential
about 80% housing, 1% shops and garages
and the remainder a play area.         
Included in the area is a dominant     
wood supplier Cox Long on Silkmore     
Lane.  The Wolverhampton Road divides  
the area into two, most of the shops   
and the school being on the Rising     
Brook side.  There is a distinct lack  
of leisure facilities apart from a pub 
and betting shop.  There are 16 shops  
in the area ranging from a Co-op       
supermarket to privately owned grocers 
and hardware stores.  Many pensioners  
live in bungalows on the Rising Brook  
side.
