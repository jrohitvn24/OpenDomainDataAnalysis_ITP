		<content>  Most of the pub sites in the area are
 ancient.{The Griffin}(formerly{The    
{Magpie}) appears to be the oldest     
 building.                             
   The{Seven Stars}(seven stars round  
 the Virgin's crown) was built in{     
{1770}and rebuilt more recently.       
   The{Royal Oak,Bird i'th Hand}and{   
{Stanley Arms}are newly built on old   
 sites and tales of ghosts abound.     
   People leaving{The Stanley}late at  
 night have a good chance of seeing the
{BRIDE IN WHITE}who haunted the area   
 round{Gillars Green.}She died of a    
 broken heart when her husband went to 
 war centuries ago.Another ghost is    
 that of{DAVE EARP}who killed a        
 policeman during the last century     
 whilst returning from a poaching trip 
 at Knowsley Park.He was discovered in 
 the old mineshafts and now parades    
 round{Millfields}and{Triplex}grounds. </content>
