		<content>The majority of land cover of the area 
is taken up by farmland. There are 16  
farms in our block and their land use  
can be divided into two main           
categories. One of the categories being
crops the other being grassland.       
   The crops tend to be mainly         
vegetables which vary upon the time of 
year. The large percentage of the      
grassland, being used for hay.         
    There is one farm which has land   
developed for grazing purposes. They   
only have however, a herd of about 200 
sheep.                                 
    Most of the farms have their own   
small vehicles-tractors etc.- and large
machinery such as combine harvestors or
crop spraying helicopters are hired    
from outside contractors.              
    Most of the farm buildings tend to 
be quite large comprising of houses,   
several barns and outbuildings.        </content>
