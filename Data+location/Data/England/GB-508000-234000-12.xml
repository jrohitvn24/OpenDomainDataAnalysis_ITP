 Cainhoe Manor continued               
 Henry VIII's hunting lodges but this  
 could be attributed to the fertile    
 imagination of some estate agents.    
                                       
 There is an old mill, now redundant,  
 converted into a dwelling house owned 
 by Mr Russell who is a master sadler. 
 He makes and repairs saddles in a     
 workshop on the premises and also runs
 a business selling riding equipment   
 and horse and pony food. His wife     
 helps run the shop with the help of   
 one part-time lady assistant. Mr      
 Russell also has one apprentice       
 sadler(female).
