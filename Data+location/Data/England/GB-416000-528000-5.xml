		<title>05A DAY IN THE LIFE OF: _</title>
		<content> A PARENT (Leech Estate, Greenfield)   
 ...My day starts at 7.30am, with a    
 rush to get to work.  I am employed   
 locally by a television manufacturing 
 Company.  My hours are between 8.30am 
 and 4.30pm, with a lunch break from   
 1pm until 1.30 pm.  Living close to my
 work gives me much leisure time.  My  
 evenings include gardening, walking   
 the dogs, bowling, wine making and    
 especially spending time at home with 
 my wife and son. I watch TV until     
 11pm, and finish the day with 30min   
 Newspaper reading in bed....          
 A CHILD (Rush Park, Etherley Dene)    
 ...I woke up at 9.30am and after      
 breakfast went to the swimming baths  
 with my sister unil 12.30pm.  After   
 dinner at home I played football with 
 my friend until 6pm. After tea I went 
 kite flying and then watched TV until 
 9.30pm when I went to bed....         </content>
