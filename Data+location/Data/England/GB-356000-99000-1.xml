		<title>01The Area around Cattistock</title>
		<content> This is an agricultural area of small 
 and medium sized farms, with dairy    
 farming predominating, set in the     
 hilly chalk downland of West Dorset   
 and designated as an Area of          
 Outstanding Natural Beauty.   The     
 River Frome runs from north to south  
 through the area, one and a half miles
 from its source, with the single track
 of the Westbury to Weymouth railway   
 branch line running alongside.        
 The main A.356 road runs for half a   
 mile through the south west corner of 
 the area, otherwise the villages,     
 hamlets and farms are connected by    
 narrow country lanes.  There are also 
 about six miles of footpaths.         
 Tourism has little impact.   A few    
 holiday cottages being let to holiday 
 visitors and a few private houses     
 providing bed and breakfast           
 accommodation.                        </content>
