   One game we play in the playground  
 is called{STUCK IN THE MUD.}This is a 
 game of "had" where one person is "on 
 it" and he has to touch you. Then you 
 have to stand still with your legs    
 apart and you can only be "set free"  
 by another player crawling through    
 your legs. When you have been touched 
 three times you will then be "on it"  
 and the game starts again.            
   Another game is called {PUSS IN THE 
{CORNER}For this game you need 6 or    
 more players and 4 corners of the     
 playground. There is 1 "dog" and the  
 other 5 are the "cats". The "cats" go 
 and stand in the corners (2 in one    
 corner) and the "dog" stands in the   
 middle. The Spare "Cat" runs to       
 another corner and says"Budge" to the 
 cat already there. When he moves,the  
 "dog" must try to catch the "cat".    </content>
