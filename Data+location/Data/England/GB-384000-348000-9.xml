		<title>09LANDSCAPE BURSLEM TOWN-HALL.</title>
		<content>  In the middle of Burslem is the Town 
Hall,but it is nowadays used as a      
leisure centre.The rooms can be hired  
by members of the public for meetings  
or to practice playing instruments or  
dancing in,and there are certain rooms 
that are just for sport.Thereis a room 
with a multi-gym in it,and another for 
badmington.Some of the activities that 
take place there are:weight-lifting,   
Kung-Fu,break-dancing and second hand  
record sales.                          
             The Town Hall is owned by 
the Council and people who use the     
rooms and facilities have to pay a fee 
for hiring the rooms.The cost varies   
depnding on what you use,and if you are
a pensioner or you are unemployed the  
fees are reduced.                      
                Thisw an attempt to    
provide leisure facilitiesin an area   
where there are very few.              </content>
