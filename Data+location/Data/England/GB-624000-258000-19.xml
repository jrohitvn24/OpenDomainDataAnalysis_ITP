		<title>19Life as a VIformer.Hoo area.</title>
		<content> I catch the bus to schoo at 8.35      
arriving at 9 am.I study History,Geogr-
aphy &amp; Politics "A" levels.Lessons are 
from 9.20 to 12 and 1 to 3.45."Free"   
periods can be spent in the small      
library &amp; the rooms adjacent to the    
Common Room.I,like many others,spend   
too much time in th Common Room where a
coffee bar &amp; tuck shop is run.The VI   
Form Society subsidises trips to plays,
films &amp; concerts,classical and rock,and
provides a Student card.               
 At dinner times I go to the "Crown &amp;  
Anchor" to avoid the canteen and       
boredom whenever possible,but on       
Wednesday I am on Prefect Duty with a  
friend. Visits into Framlingham are    
allowed, as is smoking along New       
Street.                                
 I spend the evening listening to music
or watching T.V. Ocasionally I go to   
see friends or to the pub with them.   </content>
