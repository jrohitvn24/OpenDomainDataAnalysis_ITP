		<content>There is a famous oysterage situated   
along the river bank. Mussels can be   
collected at low-tide.                 
Other paths give views of open farm    
land when fields are fenced or divided 
bedges. In many cases shelter belts of 
trees have been planted to prevent soil
erosion and conserve wildlife. There is
an large area of coniferous forest     
commissioned in the late 1920's and    
also a famous primeval oak wood, called
The Thicks, which contains the tallest 
holly tree in Britain.                 
                                       
Deer, squirrels, rabbits, pheasants and
partridges are far more numerous than  
man in this unspoiled countryside.
