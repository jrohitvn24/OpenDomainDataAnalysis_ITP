		<content> The following quotes were made by the 
{children of Holy Cross Junior School, 
{Shrewsbury when commenting on their   
{Domesday Study Area:                  
 A lovely landscape...A rolling        
 landscape flows along picking out the 
 old farm buildings worn by time. The  
 farm houses are isolated old and      
 shabby. They have far more character  
 than the houses around Holy Cross.    
 There is modern farming equipment and 
 electric fences to keep the cattle in 
 one place...narrow lanes and little   
 traffic...didn't see any traffic      
 lights...Houses and bungalows were    
 detached and looked as if people who  
 lived in them had a lot of money. Life
 in the rural area seemed to be slower 
 than in an urban area, the people are 
 rather quiet and shy. People in rural 
 areas know each other better, they    
 are very close knit and friendly.     </content>
