		<content>  Bofors is a factory in the village of
 Ramsden Heath where they make buckets 
 to fit onto diggers,and parts for     
 fork-lift trucks.They are a Swedish   
 firm.                                 
  There are three main parts to the    
 building. Firstly there is the office 
 block where the decisions are made and
 where all the files are kept. The file
 with the list of components is kept on
 computers for instant 3-D display.This
 is because so many components are     
 needed.In the second building they    
 shape the buckets and make the parts  
 for fort-lift trucks.They weld all the
 shapes together here,before taking    
 them to the third building. In this   
 building the parts are spray painted. 
  Two years ago they made a bucket     
 which was large enough to hold 50     
 men.This is the biggest bucket in the 
 world.                                </content>
