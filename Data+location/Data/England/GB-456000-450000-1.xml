		<title>01REVIEW OF THE BLOCK.</title>
		<content>  The block covers the west side of    
 York which takes in a small part of   
 the historic walled city,including the
 Yorkshire Museum and Micklegate       
 Bar.Most of the area is covered by    
 housing,some private and some on large
 council estates.                      
  The River Ouse cuts across the block 
 in the NE corner,crossed by Lendal    
 Bridge on the line of the City Walls  
 and by Clifton Bridge.To the south of 
 the river are York Station and the    
 carriage works.The railway covers a   
 lot of ground and employs lots of     
 people.York is an important station on
 the East Coast Line between London and
 Edinburgh.                            
  There are areas of open ground in the
 block;the Knavesmire,home of York     
 Races and the site of Tyburn Gallows  
 where Dick Turpin was hanged,in the   
 south and Clifton Ings in the north.  </content>
