		<content> The eastern two thirds of the block is
 an upland plateau of Coal Measure rock
 about 350m high,covered in moor and   
 marsh until modern agricultural       
 techniques made it productive grazing 
 land with only the odd patch of       
 original cover.To the west the ground 
 scarps steeply to the sheltered stream
 valleys first carved by glaciers and  
 now occupied by the villages of       
 Hepworth and Jackson Bridge.Long      
 association with the wool industry is 
 evidenced by the weaver's cottages and
 mill sites, where the soft and        
 plentiful water encouraged the        
 industry's growth. The hillside above 
 Jackson Bridge was mined for coal and 
 fire clay and led to the foundation of
 the Hepworth Iron and Coal Company.Now
 dormitory development of the villages 
 has taken over while the land is      
 farmed ever more intensively.         </content>
