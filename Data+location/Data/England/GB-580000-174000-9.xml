		<content> My real name is Katherine.  I live at 
 7 Windmill Cottages with my Mum, Dad  
 and two sisters.  My dad has just got 
 a job in Strood, working for Tesco's  
 Supermarket and gets up at 5 am.  I   
 get up at 7.45 am.                    
 For breakfast I have cereals with tea 
 or milk to drink. Sometimes I have    
 toast with marmite.  I leave for Stoke
 School at 8.50 am. and my sister      
 Joanne catches a bus to Allhallows at 
 9.05 am.   I bring a packed lunch to  
 school. Most people have school       
 dinners.                              
 At school I do English and Mathematics
 and Art &amp; Craft with games and TV     
 programmes.  We also sing and do other
 things.                               
 I like working Fletcher Maths best of 
 all.                                  
 We have lunch from 12 o'clock until   
 1.10 pm.                              </content>
