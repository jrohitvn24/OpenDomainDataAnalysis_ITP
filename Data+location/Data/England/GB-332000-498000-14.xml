		<content> This area relies heavily on tourism.  
 During the summer the population      
 increases considerably with holiday   
 makers, day trippers and coach tours. 
 This vast influx of visitors does     
 affect the local community as the     
 shops, hotels and guest houses become 
 full, so we find our narrow           
 picturesque streets bulging with      
 strangers. We are quite relieved when 
 winter comes, and Hawkshead is        
 peaceful once more. Much of the       
 population consists of retired people,
 many of whom have come from urban     
 districts, whereas younger people tend
 to move away for college or employ-   
 ment, perhaps returning later with a  
 trade or profession to their credit,  
 enabling them to start up a business  
 of their own. Another section of the  
 community are those who have left     
 behind the pressures of city life.    </content>
