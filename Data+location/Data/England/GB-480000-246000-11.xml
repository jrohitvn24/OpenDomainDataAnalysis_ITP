		<title>11HANSLOPE CHURCH TOWER TRIP 2</title>
		<content> I nearly fell because of that step and
they were very narrow stairs.There were
only a few windows on the stair case.

To measure the height of the church    
spire you need a clinometer and a      
measuring tape.We measured from the    
bottom of the church to say 80 metres  
away.Then get the clinometer and point 
it up to the spire and read off how    
many degrees it said.Mine said 35.On   
graph paper you make a scale drawing of
the distance from the church tower to  
the clinometer and using a protractor  
mark off the degrees.When you have     
marked this ,draw a straight line      
through the mark you made and then that
gives you the answer on the vertical   
scale.My answer was 57 metres.
