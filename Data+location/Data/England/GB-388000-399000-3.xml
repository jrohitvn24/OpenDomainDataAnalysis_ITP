		<title>03TYPES OF HOUSING</title>
		<content>    In general, houses in the          
 Failsworth district tend to be of     
 mixed type, built since World War 2 of
 brick construction and owner occupied.
 The mixed nature of the housing stock 
 is amplified by the wide distribution 
 of churches, pubs, shops, schools etc.
 There is no town centre as such.  Many
 shops are concentrated along Oldham Rd
 (A62) while other facilities have     
 grown up to serve housing estates.    
{   Back to back terrace housing}built 
 around the turn of the century is     
 still evident in many places,         
 particularly near Oldham Road and     
 towards Hollinwood. Some terraces have
 and still are being demolished - to be
 replaced by flats or commercial land  
 use.                                  
    Recent housing has taken the form  
 of small, private "gap-filling"       
 developments - usually bungalows.     </content>
