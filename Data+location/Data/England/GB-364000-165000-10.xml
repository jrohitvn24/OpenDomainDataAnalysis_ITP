		<title>10Housing Survey</title>
		<content> On Monday 8th July we went out on a   
 walk to identify the houses in our    
 block.Most of the houses in Keynsham  
 are post-war,although Manor Road is   
 one of the oldest parts of Keynsham.  
 Some of the houses there are pre-war. 
 We walked along 7 roads.We made a     
 survey of the types of houses,how old 
 they are and what they are made from. 
 We went through Chandag Road,Hurn     
 Lane, Evenlode Way,Waveney Road,Medway
 Drive, Manor Road and Wellsway.       
  These are the types of houses we     
 looked for:-                          
 Terraced        Bungalow              
 Semi-Detached   Cottage               
 Detached        Linked                
  There are six shops near the school  
 in a terrace.They are a butcher,off-  
 license,greengrocer/fishmongers,news- 
 agents,post office/drapery/household  
 goods.                                </content>
