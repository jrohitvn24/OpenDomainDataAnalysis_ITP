		<content>{Bess Bagley}refers to Mrs Elizabeth   
 Bagley,who lived in the house near    
 Copt Oak at the time of the Charnwood 
 Enclosure Award in 1829.{Copt Oak,}is 
 a tiny village at the ancient centre  
 of the forest.Here,under a great tree 
 (the copest,or copt oak)the old       
 Swanimote Court of Groby Manor met.The
 tree,which stood at the back of the   
 present churchyard,blew down in 1855. 
 It was reputedly 2000yrs old,20ft (6m)
 high and 24ft(7.5m) in circumference. 
 Enclosure came late to Charnwood,with 
 the Act in 1808 and the Award in      
 1829.Most of the roads date from this 
 time.{Joe Moore's Lane}is named after 
 a man who lived in the Maplewell Woods
 and who went to live in America.      
{Whitcroft's Lane}was named after John 
 Whitcroft who lived near Copt Oak and 
 was one of the last people to remember
 the unenclosed forest.                </content>
