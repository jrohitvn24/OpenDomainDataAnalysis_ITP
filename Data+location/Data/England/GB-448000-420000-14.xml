		<content> There is quite a good bus service     
 through our area.The 148,149 and 150  
 leave our estate for Wakefield every  
 20 minutes. The journey to Wakefield  
 takes about 1 hour and we have used   
 this service to travel to Wakefield   
 and Pontefract Art Galleries in groups
 from our school. There is also a      
 single-decker bus to Leeds which      
 leaves at 30 minutes past the hour.   
 We are well placed for road transport 
 with easy access to both major roads, 
 the A1 and M62,from all parts of the  
 grid.                                 
 The railway line which runs across our
 grid is used mainly by 'round-robin'  
 coal trains bringing coal from local  
 pits to local power stations.It is    
 occasionally used by High Speed Trains
 from the East Coast Main Line when    
 they are diverted.
