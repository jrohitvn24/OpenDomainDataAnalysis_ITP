   The seven to nine year olds work    
 together,and during the afternoon they
 work in their classes which are mixed 
 in ages and ability.In the morning the
 children are streamed according to    
 ability,not age ,and there is one     
 teacher who works with a small group  
 of slower learners with many special  
 teaching aids.Another teacher takes a 
 larger middle ability group ,and the  
 third teacher takes the top ability   
 group.                                
   Two of the three classes are in     
 rooms which are next door to each     
 other and have had one section of the 
 wall removed so that more of a        
 team teaching situation can be        
 established.The third room is at the  
 end of a corridor apart from the other
 two.
