		<content> The {ROSELAND GARDENS HOUSING ESTATE} 
 is a modern, private housing estate,  
 situated on the Northern edge of      
 REDRUTH, half a mile from the town    
 centre. Before development the site   
 was farmland. The first houses were   
 completed in 1965. Some building is in
 progress(1985) and more is planned for
 the future.                           
 We gathered information about Roseland
 Gardens through a door to door survey.
 We were able to survey 92 of the 156  
 homes (59%) on the estate, and our    
 data is drawn from this sample.
