<title>37Satterthwaite Post Office and Inn</title>
<content>

The shop and post office at Town End Barn closed in 1988. People either travel to the post office in Hawkshead to collect their pensions, or have them paid directly into their bank accounts. There are two travelling vans, one a butcher the other a fishmonger. A number of residents shop on-line and have their groceries delivered by Tesco or ASDA.&lt;br />&lt;br />There is an inn in the village called the Eagleâ€™s Head. It was enlarged in the 1990s by expansion into the former residential part, making all the ground floor into a bar. There is a pool table. It is run by Rob and Rebecca Bruce and serves good food and real ale. It is popular in the summer months with holiday makers and tourists, but struggles to find trade in the winter months because there is only a small resident population; during this latter season it only opens three days a week.   &lt;br />
