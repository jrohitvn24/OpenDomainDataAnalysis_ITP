 THE POTTERY IS ABOUT 200 YEARS OLD. AT
 ONE TIME IT USED TO BE AN INN CALLED  
 THE WENFORD INN AND WAS SUPPLIED BY   
 THE ST. AUSTELL BREWERY.              
 IN 1957 THERE WAS A FLOOD WHICH RUINED
 THE WHOLE AREA,THE TABLE INSIDE THE   
 HOUSE WAS FLOATING IN ALL THE WATER   
 YOU CAN STILL SEE THE MARK ON THE     
 TABLE MADE BY THE WATER. PART OF THE  
 BUILDING WAS BURNT DOWN AND REBUILT IN
 1963 AND YOU CAN STILL SEE THE        
 BLACKSMITHS DEPARTMENT.THERE USED TO  
 BE A SKITTLE ALLY THERE WHEN IT WAS A 
 BREW HOUSE (WE DO NOT KNOW WHO OWNED  
 IT).                                  
 THERE WAS A COAL TRAIN THAT PASSED THE
 POTTERY ONCE A DAY AT LUNCH TIME AND  
 ENDED AT LOWER LANK.                  
 THERE WAS ALSO A MOTORIZED TRAIN      
 RUNNING THROUGH DELANK QUARRY WHICH IS
 NEAR THE POTTERY.                     </content>
