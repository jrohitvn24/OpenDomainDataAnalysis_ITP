		<title>14LANDSCAPE IN PANTON</title>
		<content>{PANTON'S }district consists of gently 
 undulating countryside interspersed   
 with deciduous and coniferous         
 woodlands.  Some of the coniferous    
 woods were planted by the Forestry    
 Commission who maintain and replant   
 the woods when necessary. Most of the 
 cottages were erected by the Turnor   
 family of the former {PANTON}Hall in  
 the Cl8 and are of brick construction 
 with slate roofs but, where modernis- 
 ation has taken place, the slates have
 been sympathetically replaced with    
 grey pantiles. Warren Farm buildings, 
 built by John Carr in l777, still     
 remain. These consist of large brick  
 barns and stables with slate roofs    
 and, although recent modern barns have
 been erected, the brick ranges show   
 the character of former farming times.
