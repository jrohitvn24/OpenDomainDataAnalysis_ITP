		<content> There are a few of general meetings in
Chiddingly Village Hall. The dicussion 
is often concerned with the progess of 
the proposed development and schemes.  
Sometimes this will include restoration
or improvement or certain amenities or 
constructions.                         
                                       
 The council also arrange some         
parties or celebrations which are      
usually held in some villagers' homes  
or gardens. This provides an           
opportunity for the people to meet     
and talk to their friends.             
                                       
 There are also dog and horse shows    
which people enjoy. Villagers usually  
give support to the show, e.g prepare  
refreshment for the show.
