		<content> A quite dramatic change has taken     
 place within the survey area and it   
 was decided to interview residents who
 had lived in the vicinity during the  
 past 40 years. They were asked whether
 in their opinion, the area had changed
 for the better or not. Also they were 
 asked to suggest one facility they    
 thought would improve the level of    
 amenities available. Of 100 adults    
 questioned, 33 believed that the area 
 had improved, being cleaner, less     
 built up and more friendly than       
 previously. 22 people thought that the
 area had deteriorated, the main       
 reasons being that loss of industry   
 meant loss of jobs and opportunities. 
 The remainder believed that changes   
 made little difference to community   
 spirit or amenities available. The    
 only noteable improvement was more    
 open space. 75% wanted a bank.        </content>
