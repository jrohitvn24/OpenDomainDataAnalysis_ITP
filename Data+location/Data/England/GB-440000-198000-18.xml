woodland area which is privatly owned  
leading down to the river.There are    
two nurseries on the Upper Common.     
 The main crop at Hills Nursery is     
roses.They cultivate 121 varieties of  
roses.Rows of roses stretch from the   
road.On one side asparagus,celery,     
shrubs and fuscias are also grown.     
 Mr Ford owns Swallows Nurseries. He   
grows strawberries as his main crop.   
Most of the crops are grown in special 
blown up greenhouses.People come to    
pick their own soft fruit.He also      
grows crysanthemums for the winter     
markets.                               
 Appleton Woods have two quiet,shadey  
footpaths leading towards the River    
Thames.There are the remains of an old 
wier at the edge of the wood and a     
house overgrown with reeds and plants. 
At the moment trees are being felled.  </content>
