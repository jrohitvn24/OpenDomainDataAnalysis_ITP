		<title>03THE POPULATION OF FELMINGHAM</title>
		<content> The total population of the Village is
 approximately 600, with less than 400 
 being on the Electorial Roll. The     
 different age groups are evenly       
 matched; no particular age being left 
 out in the social life of the Village.
 The majority of residents live in     
 terraced houses, but since l960, two  
 small estates of bungalows have been  
 built close to the Church, and also   
 one or two houses.                    
 Local public transport is almost      
 non-existant, and so there is great   
 reliance on motor cars. The railway   
 was closed many years ago, and the    
 cutting is now used as part of the    
 Weaver's Way Walk.
