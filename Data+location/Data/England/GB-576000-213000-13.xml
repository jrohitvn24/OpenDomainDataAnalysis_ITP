		<title>13EVENTS IN TERLING</title>
		<content> Until this year there has always been 
 a Parish Supper, held in the school   
 hall on Shrove Tuesday, which has     
 consisted of a 3 course meal with     
 wine. Also,for the past 2 years there 
 has been a Concert and supper arranged
 by the Church choir. The Church       
 usually has a summer fete in the      
 grounds of Terling Place, and this    
 year it was combined with a Flower    
 Festival in the Church and an         
 exhibition of children's art in the   
 chapel. Every summer the numerous     
 clubs combine for a Summer Festival,  
 each providing a stall or activity.   
 This year it was held on the Church   
 Green and the theme was "Merry Old    
 England", and for the first time the  
 School ran a stall and a display of   
 Country Dancing. The day had begun    
 with a Half Marathon round the village
 and it ended with a Barbeque and Disco</content>
