		<title>03IN SERVICE AT BUNNY HALL</title>
		<content> Minnie Young left school at the age of
 13 in 1922 and went to work for the   
 Cordeaux family at Bunny Hall. She was
 employed as a parlour maid and she had
 her own room. It was hard work. Minnie
 got up at 7.00 a.m. and lay the table 
 for breakfast, then she would clean   
 and polish the silver and china. After
 that she would change her clothes for 
 a black uniform, a white cap and apron
 to serve luncheon. At about 3.00 p.m. 
 Minnie would serve tea to Mrs.Cordeaux
 and sometimes to Dr. Cordeaux.        
 At 7.00 p.m. the gong would ring for  
 dinner and everyone would be there.   
 The table could hold twenty and Minnie
 helped to serve. At about 8.00 p.m.   
 Minnie would go to bed.               
 There were other servants in the house
 plus Billy a stable lad and Parks the 
 chauffeur who drove the Rolls Royce   
 and Daimler.                          </content>
