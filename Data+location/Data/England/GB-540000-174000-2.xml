		<content>Tudor Barn                             
This early sixteenth century barn was  
originally an outbuilding of a large   
moated house which was demolished in   
1733.The site is of Saxon origin and   
was occupied by Edith Nesbit from 1899-
1922.The red-brick two storey barn,    
together with the contemporary moat and
bridge was purchased by Woolich Borough
Council in 1931 and was restored.It is 
surrounded by beautiful grounds known  
as The Pleasance and is now used as a  
retaurant and art gallery.             
                                       
Severndroog Castle.                    
This folly-tower is situated in Jack   
Wood on Shooters Hill.It was designed  
by Richard Jupp in 1784,in memory of   
Sir William James,the adventurer of    
the Indian Ocean,who resided at Eltham 
Park.
