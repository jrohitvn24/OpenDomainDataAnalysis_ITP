		<title>01GORRAN  - GENERAL</title>
		<content> This is an area of great natural      
 beauty - rugged cliffs, tiny coves and
 sandy beaches.  From Great Perhaver   
 Point past the harbour at Gorran      
 Haven,along the coast to Dodman       
 Pt.,which rises to 372 ft. and was    
 once an Iron Age fort - earth ramparts
 and ancient tumuli are clearly        
 visible. Along the coast and inland   
 are scattered small farms. The        
 National Trust owns much of the area, 
 and several of the farms. The main    
 population centre is Gorran Haven,    
 once a small fishing village which has
 grown vastly over the past 25 years.  
 Many holiday makers visit every year .
 The village has a garage, sub         
 post-office, bakery, grocery. doctor's
 surgery, and two cafes. There is a    
 tiny church and a Methodist Chapel.
