		<title>01WOODTON &amp; NEARBY PARISHES</title>
		<content> This Norfolk block includes 75%       
 Woodton,25% Hedenham &amp; small parts of 
 Kirstead,Brooke &amp; Seething,hereafter  
 called{"Woodton Area"}.It is open     
 countryside devoted to arable or mixed
 farming,but also includes part of the 
 built-up area of Woodton,Woodton's    
 Primary School &amp; its round-towered    
 church.Many families have lived here  
 for 2 or 3 generations,but there are  
 also many incomers drawn by its rural 
 peace.Each parish,except Hedenham &amp;   
 Kirstead,has a Parish Council &amp; all   
 lie within the aegis of South Norfolk 
 D.C.Though there are the farms &amp; a few
 small businesses,many people must     
 commute for work.Bus services enable  
 people to reach nearby towns,but a    
 high proportion own cars enabling them
 to get to work,visit a wider variety  
 of shops or their doctor.
