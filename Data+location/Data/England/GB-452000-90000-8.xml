		<title>08YOUNG FAMILY IN WOOTTON</title>
		<content>  A young mother told us: the main     
 reason for our living in Wootton is   
 its convenient location between       
 Newport and Ryde.The local facilities 
 are good with a frequent Bus Service  
 and a Mobile Library which visits once
 a week.A dentist is needed in our     
 opinion.There are activities for our  
 daughter and also for the old.We use  
 the recreation ground and go to the   
 local "Mothers and Toddlers" group.A  
 typical day consists of housework,    
 shopping, lunch, gardening and tea.   
     This area is quiet and wellkept,  
 the roads and beaches could be        
 improved,but that's all.The Ferry     
 Terminal is handy when we want to     
 visit our relatives.When we moved here
 we were well looked after and the     
 people were friendly.Our daughter will
 soon use the playgroup and then go    
 to the local Primary School.          </content>
