		<title>05The Compleat Angler</title>
		<content>{The Compleat Angler}was built in      
{Marlow}sometime before 1658. It is one
 of the most expensive hotels in       
{Buckinghamshire.}The Hotel  was       
 run by a family until five years ago  
 when it was taken over by Trust House 
 Forte. It was first called The        
 Waterside Inn, when an author called  
 Izaac Walton wrote a book while he was
 staying there called{The Compleat     
{Angler,}and so it was renamed in 1659.
 The facilities available for the      
 guests are tennis courts, a helicopter
 launching pad, twenty four hour food  
 services and a valet service. If you  
 wanted to stay there it would cost    
 you Â£60 a night without breakfast, Â£75
 for a double room and Â£160 for a      
 suite. President Ford and President   
 Carter have both stayed there. Ali    
 McGraw spent over Â£6000 when she spent
 a holiday there.                      </content>
