		<title>13TRANSPORT Canal 2</title>
		<content> boats had very little living space for
 a family. The living quarters were a  
 space about 6 feet by 8 feet in which 
 the whole family had to sleep and eat.
 The children did not go to school.They
 led the horse, which pulled the barge,
 along the towpath. At Batchworth Lock 
 there are stone runs sticking out of  
 the ground to help the horse not to   
 slip when going up the slope. There is
 also a small house, now someone's home
 which looks as if it used to be a     
 stable. They took paper, gravel and   
 farm produce to London and brought    
 coal and wood back.                   
   Westward on the towpath are houses  
 with beautiful gardens, open farming  
 land (pasture) and on the right the   
 Aquadrome. We walked as far as        
 Stockers Lock where there was a       
 traditional lock-keeper's cottage with
 windows facing up and down the canal. </content>
