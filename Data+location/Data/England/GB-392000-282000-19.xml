		<title>19FIRE SERVICES</title>
		<content>    Our local fire station is situated 
 on the Hagley Road.Most of the time   
 when firemen can't get water they use 
 a hydrant.The station is used for     
 fighting fire,accidents,pumping water 
 from floods and rescuing people.So the
 fire  service is very important.      
   The fire station at Hasbury was     
 opened in 1963.It covers the Halesowen
 area but sometimes the engines are    
 called out to places further          
 away.There are two engines at Hasbury 
 but in the daytime only one of them is
 allowed to go to a fire because the   
 other is a part-time fire engine.There
 are 33 firemen at Hasbury.They have to
 keep the engines and equipment clean  
 and ready for use.They have to check  
 pavement hydrants,clubs and halls to  
 make sure they are safe.
