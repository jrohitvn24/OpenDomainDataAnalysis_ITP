		<title>03YOUTH FACILITIES, THATCHAM.</title>
		<content> The youth organisations met in Kennet 
 School in May to discuss the lack of  
 facilities for the young in Thatcham. 
 It was felt that the needs of young   
 people were not being met.Many new    
 houses are being built without any    
 facilities for the young.A B.M.X.track
 and a swimming pool were suggested.   
 Leaders agreed that Kennet School     
 could benefit more people by becoming 
 a community centre.Some organistions  
 find the hiring costs too high. Dr.   
 Wheeler-Robinson headmaster, was happy
 for the school to be used more,whilst 
 agreeing that the cost was enormous.  
 Kennet School is used as a centre for 
 evening classes in Thatcham, a youth  
 club meets there three times a week.  
 The sports hall is used by Thatcham   
 people at weekends and the hall by    
 local music and drama societies.
