		<content> I am Helen,I am 11 years old and I    
 live in{Chippenham.}My family is made 
 up of my two sisters,my one brother,my
 Mum and Dad and myself.On a typical   
 day in my family Dad gets up first,and
 goes off to work. He works with       
 computers for a firm in{Devizes,}a    
 town about 16km.from Chippenham.      
 We get up at about 7.30am.and get     
 washed and dressed then have          
 breakfast.Mum takes us to school in   
 the family car because Dad goes to    
 work on his motorbike.Mum stays at    
 home and works as a housewife.        
 When we get home from school we get   
 changed out of our school uniform and 
 go out to play.When Dad comes home at 
 5.30pm.we have tea together.Sometimes 
 we watch television and our bedtime is
 between 8.30.and 9.00pm.Mum and Dad go
 to bed later in the evening.
