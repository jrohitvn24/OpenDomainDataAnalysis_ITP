		<content>   In Rainham there are {Roads,Streets 
Closes,Walks and   Avenues.}A Close is 
a place where there is only one way    
in and out and a walk  is special      
because you can only walk in           
one.An avenue is special because it    
has trees growing along it.            
   A lot traffic goes along Station    
Road but cars cannot park where there  
are single and double yellow lines.    
They can park for a little while where 
there are broken yellow lines. Traffic 
lights show you to go,or stop or get   
ready.The red one is for stop and the  
green one for go.Traffic lights are    
for when one car must stop and another 
can go.                                
 We went to have a look at the Gardens.
Those in Wakeley Road had open         
Those in other streets had walls and   
hedges and gates.
