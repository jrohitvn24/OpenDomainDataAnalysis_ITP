		<title>16THE BEACH, BOURNEMOUTH</title>
		<content>   OUR FAMILY HAVE A BEACH HUT AT      
 SOUTHBOURNE BEACH.  WE SHARE IT WITH  
 OUR RELATIONS.  I HAVE THREE COUSINS  
 BUT ONLY ONE IS MY AGE AND HER NAME IS
 CLARE.  CLARE AND I OFTEN GO AND BUILD
 SANDCASTLES AND MAZES. WE ALSO DIG BIG
 HOLES.  WHEN WE GO IN THE SEA WE TAKE 
 INFLATABLE TOYS.  ONE OF THE TOYS IS A
 BIG TYRE.  WE BOTH SIT OPPOSITE EACH  
 OTHER AND WHEN A LARGE WAVE COMES WE  
 BOTH FALL OFF. WE ALSO TAKE AN        
 INFLATABLE BOAT IN AND WE TIP EACH    
 OTHER OUT.  SOMETIMES THE SEA IS WARM 
 BUT IT IS NORMALLY COLD.  SOMETIMES   
 THE SAND IS CROWDED AND IT IS HARD TO 
 FIND A PLACE TO PLAY.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
