		<title>03THE LIFE OF A FOREST RANGER</title>
		<content> There are four Forest Rangers and a   
 tractor driver fully employed by the {
{Ashdown Forest Centre}.They lead a    
 strenuous  but enjoyable outdoor life.
 Their busiest time is during the      
 summer months of June, July and August
 as this is the time the forest is in  
 most use by the general public for    
 picnicking, walking and riding.       
 Besides{forest management}the ranger  
 maintains parking areas,constructs    
 fire breaks and keeps a watchful eye  
 on the wild life.The {Forest Centre   
{has a}comprehensive display and record
 of the natural attractions of the     
 area.The main problems facing the     
 forest ranger are caused by the number
 of people visiting the area.{Pollution
 and the associated problems of fire   
 and wilful distruction of trees are   
 all part of the rangers daily         
 problems.                             </content>
