		<title>08THE LEAD MINES OF PRIDDY</title>
		<content> Lead mining began in this area during 
 Roman times. The Roman road that cuts 
 across the area was built to transport
 the lead to Bath and to ports near    
 Bristol and on the South Coast. Mining
 was also a major economic activity    
 during the 19th century. Today,       
 however there are only the remains of 
 what was an important industry. Most  
 of the buildings have gone but the    
 spoils heaps and the pools used to    
 wash the lead still remain. The last  
 mine closed at the beginning of this  
 century. The risk to health was       
 unknown in those days but there is    
 evidence to proove that many of the   
 workers suffered because of the work  
 they had to do.
