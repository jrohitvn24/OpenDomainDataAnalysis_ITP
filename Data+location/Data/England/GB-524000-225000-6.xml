		<title>06A Working Mum's Day in Stev.</title>
		<content>   My day starts at 6.3Oa.m.I sit down 
 for breakfast with the family at 7.3O 
 and leave at 8.3Oam to drive the mile 
 to the{school}where I teach.The       
 morning session from 9-12 is broken   
 by a fifteen minute{coffee break,     
 which I have in the staffroom. There  
 is an hour and a quarter lunch break  
 before the afternoon session begins.  
 School finishes at 3.15 and I leave   
 for home an hour later, having        
 organized the{classroom}in readiness  
 for the next day.                     
 On arriving home I provide a snack    
 for my children before preparing the  
 evening meal, which we eat around     
 6.OO. The rest of the evening is spent
 in planning school work for the       
 following day, doing housework,       
 watching{T.V.}and preparing a light   
{supper.}
