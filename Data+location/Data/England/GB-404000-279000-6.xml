Action Group} and was first published  
in April 1984. All the reporters were  
local volunteers. A 10 pence charge was
made to cover printing costs and the   
magazine was at first produced monthly 
and later bi-monthly. The wide range of
topics covered included local news and 
comments, the history of the area,     
interviews, information on local events

campaign for a {community centre} and

tradition of the {Stirchley Carnival.}
