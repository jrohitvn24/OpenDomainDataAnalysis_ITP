		<content> Hutton Henry has only one shop.It is a
 Post Office and General Dealer and    
 sells food,sweets,stationary and      
 frozen foods.There are also vans      
 coming to the village-a baker,a       
 butcher,a fishmonger,an ice cream man 
 and a coalman.These travelling shops  
 come to the village because if they   
 did not people would have to go out of
 the area to do their shopping.Station 
 Town and Wingate have lots of shops,  
 such as the Co-op,newsagents,take_away
 food shops,general dealers, bakers,   
 butchers and clothes shops. There is  
 also an open-air market on a Thursday.
 If you want clothes or something      
 special you will have to go to a large
 town such as Peterlee, Hartlepool,    
 Sunderland,Stockton or Newcastle.Each 
 Friday there is a special bus that    
 takes shoppers to a hypermarket at    
 Stockton.                             </content>
