      The lambs are kept outdoors until
 October/November time when they are   
 then about seven months old.It is at  
 that time that they are taken to      
 market on the Plain where they are    
 sold for slaughter.Each year a few of 
 the young females are kept back and   
 older ones are sold in their place.In 
 this way the farmer is constantly     
 renewing his flock and keeping it     
 strong and healthy.When the lambs are 
 newly born they are prone to predation
 from foxes and from crows.The crows   
 especially are a real menace as they  
 will peck at the lamb's eyes and also 
 at the umbilical cord still attached  
 to its stomach.Constant pecking and   
 pulling at the cord gradually pulls   
 the whole of the lamb's stomach and   
 intestines out and of course destroys 
 the animal.                           </content>
