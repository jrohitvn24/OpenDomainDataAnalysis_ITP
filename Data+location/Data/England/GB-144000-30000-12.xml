		<title>12MADRON CHURCH.</title>
		<content>  Madron Church is the "Mother" church 
 of Penzance.It was consecrated on the 
 1st.of{July 1336, }shows architectural
 styles of different ages and is ded-  
 icated to St. Maddern who was a 6th.  
 century Breton saint and missionary.  
 It was built of granite and took 50   
 years for local craftsmen to complete.
  The seating capacity is 500 and the  
 14th. cent. tower has a peal of eight 
 bells.Special features include a fine 
 rood screen,a{Norman font,}a wagon    
 roof with carved angels,brasses and   
 "Nelson's Flag".This was hastily made 
 and carried to Madron Church when the 
 people of Penzance heard the          
 victorious news of Trafalgar.         
  The Baptistry is supposedly the      
 original site of St. Maddern's church 
 and is still used for mid-summer bap- 
 tisms.The water from the well never   
 runs dry and has healing properties. H</content>
