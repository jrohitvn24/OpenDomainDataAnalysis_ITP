		<title>05A FARMER'S DAY</title>
		<content>{Mr. Wallace,Farrows Farm, Ashwell.    
 The working day starts at 7a.m.On this
 July day he first saw his arable man  
 to prepare the combine harvester for  
 gathering winter barley and routine   
 servicing and his 2 pigmen. He loaded 
 culled sows to take to slaughter      
 and then paid the pickers in the soft 
 fruit fields. Some business work took 
 him to{"beaver":an}Ashwell term for   
 break at 9:30.                        
 At 10a.m. he opened the farm caravan  
 to sell produce and then did some     
 maintenance work and repairs before   
 doing 2 hours{office}work. This takes 
 up more and more time.                
 The afternoon was spent checking the  
 fruit fields and taking samples of    
 winter wheat.The day usually ends at  
 4 p.m. though there is summer         
{overtime.}The farm has been in        
 his family since around 1650.         </content>
