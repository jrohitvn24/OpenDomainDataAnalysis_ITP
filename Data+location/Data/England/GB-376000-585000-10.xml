		<content> Lanehead is a hamlet which used to    
 have a thriving shop and post office  
 before the motor car gave easier      
 access to towns and cheaper           
 supermarkets.  Today there are 15     
 dwellings-11 detached and 2 sets of   
 two linked. The occupants of these    
 are as follows:                       
     3:working families with children  
     5:   "      "      w/o   "        
     5:retired people                  
     2:holiday homes                   
 There is a workshop where frames are  
 made for a timber frame house building
 business now based in Hexham.  The old
 chapel, built in 1902, has been       
 converted to a dwelling house.  The   
 stone for the chapel, some of the     
 houses and the dry-stone walls was    
 taken from the new disused quarry on  
 the opposite side of the road from the
 chapel.                               </content>
