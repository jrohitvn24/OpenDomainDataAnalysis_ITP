		<title>18   TURF AND TRAVEL</title>
		<content> Turf and Travel was a large building  
 which is filled with a massive        
 selection of items to do with horses. 
 The man inside didn't tell us his name
 but he was extremely nice and told us 
 many different things.All the saddles 
 are hand made.The building used to be 
 a farm. Turf and Travel have been in  
 business for about two years.They have
 a cross-country course with fourteen  
 jumps and they also hold Dressage     
 Competitions for pony clubs and other 
 small organizations.Although the shop 
 is to do with horses they actually    
 only keep livestock and have          
 facilities which include calf rearing 
 pens.
