		<content> THE OTHER MAIN CONCERN IS THE LACK OF 
 A SIXTH FORM AT THE HIGH SCHOOL.IF    
 CHILDREN WISH TO CONTINUE THEIR       
 EDUCATION PASSED THE AGE OF 16 THEY   
 ARE FACED WITH HAVING TO TRANSFER TO  
 OTHER SCHOOLS WHICH HAVE A SIXTH      
 FORM.THE NEAREST OF THESE IS AT       
 WYMONDHAM.                            
 THE HIGH SCHOOL IS CONSIDERED TOO     
 SMALL BY THE L.E.A. TO WARRENT A SIXTH
 FORM AND SOME PARENTS CONSIDER THIS TO
 BE A MAJOR DRAWBACK TO THE SCHOOL AND 
 THUS TRANSFER TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR.  
 THE AMOUNT OF SPENDING BY THE NORFOLK 
 COUNTY COUNCIL HAS ALSO BECOME AN     
 ISSUE IN THE PAST YEAR FOLLOWING THE  
 PUBLICATION OF AN{H.M.I. REPORT}ON    
 NORFOLK SCHOOLS.THE REPORT HIGHLIGHTED
 VARIOUS DEFICIENCIES ESPECIALLY IN THE
 AMOUNT OF CAPITATION AND IN THE       
 DELAPIDATED STATE OF MANY OF THE      
 COUNTIES BUILDIINGS.                  </content>
