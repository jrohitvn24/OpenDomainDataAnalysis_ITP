  One day in my holiday I got up and   
 waited for a cup of tea in bed. I     
 dressed and went downstairs to        
 breakfast at 8.30.a.m.                
  Afterwards I went upstairs and       
 dressed to go out to Sandringham.     
  After we had been to Sandringham we  
 went back to the hotel and went back  
 to the hotel.We went upstairs to dress
 for dinner at 5.30p.m.                
  After dinner we went in the lounge.My
 Nanny had a shandy and I had a        
 Babysham.                             
  Me and Nanny went to have tea out.We 
 came back and at 12.30.p.m.me and     
 Nanny went to bed.                    
 .
