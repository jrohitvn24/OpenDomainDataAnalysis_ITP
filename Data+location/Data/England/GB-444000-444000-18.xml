		<title>18          FARMING</title>
		<content>      Most of the permanent grassland  
 is on the floodplain of the river, as 
 it would be too wet for crops with the
 winter floodings.                     
                                       
      There are no pig farms in our    
 area.  The mixed farms keep mostly    
 either sheep (breeding ewes) or cattle
 mainly for beef. There were no cows   
 for milking.  Most of the farms kept  
 some poultry, mainly hens but one kept
 geese to fatten for Christmas and one 
 kept ducks.                           
                                       
      Farms have less workers now      
 because they have machines to do the  
 work, machines are quicker and cheaper
 than men.  The larger farms have their
 own combine harvesters, one farm even 
 has two. All farms have at least one  
 tractor with extra equipment.
