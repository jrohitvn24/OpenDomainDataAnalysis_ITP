		<content> Results of a survey on where people   
 work showed that the great majority   
 worked within five miles of Pelsall.  
 Walsall,Aldridge and Pelsall were the 
 places where over half the people     
 asked ,worked.Of the remainder eleven 
 out of forty-eight are self employed. 
 The other 37 worked in various local  
 towns like Bloxwich,Darlaston and     
 Wolverhampton to name just three.The  
 longest travellers were one person    
 going to Chesterfield,London,Leicester
 and two to Kidderminster.Therefore    
 we can see that most people living in 
 Pelsall work locally.
