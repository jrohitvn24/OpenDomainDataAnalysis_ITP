		<content> Some Primary Schools in our block.    
{ ST.PAUL'S}(CHURCH OF ENGLAND) is 112 
 years old. It looks a bit like a      
 church because it has two storeys and 
 a bell tower. It is a small school    
 with only  three classes and four     
 teachers. The good things are that we 
 do maths and topic work. We go on lots
 of trips and we go swimming.          
{ ST BARNABAS'}(CHURCH OF ENGLAND) was 
 built a 100 years (1885) ago.But the  
 children first went to school in our  
 area in a wooden building in 1887. Our
 school is Victorian it has two        
 storeys and a bell tower. The bell    
 won't ring now as it has no clapper   
 and is rusty. It was called St.Paul's 
 Foundry School until 1913 then it     
 changed to St Barnabas because he     
 encouraged St Paul. Every year we     
 parade dressed up and entertain the   
 community.                            </content>
