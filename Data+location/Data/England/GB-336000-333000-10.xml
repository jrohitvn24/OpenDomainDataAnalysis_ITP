		<title>10The Sports Council</title>
		<content>  The Sports Council was formed in     
 Sept. 1983. The Council was formed    
 by 2 councillors and 2 outsiders,     
 because there was no sports for       
 children in the winter months. The    
 Sports Council organise 5 a side,     
 badminton, table tennis and swingball.
 In the future they hope to organise   
 hockey, volley ball and short tennis. 
  The Market Hall is open on Tuesdays  
 for anybody who wants to play any     
 games that the Council organises. To  
 get in it is 30p for children for one 
 and a half hours. On Thursdays the    
 Market Hall is used by the Ellesmere  
 B.M.X. club. They want competitions   
 and tournaments. In the winter months 
 they are going to encourage the       
 cricket club to train there. They are 
 holding sponsored events to raise     
 money for a pavillion on the Beech    
 Grove playing fields.                 </content>
