		<title>15WHERE WE LIVE</title>
		<content> We interviewed all the 74 children who
 were in school on 24 july 1985.We     
 wanted to discover where they all     
 lived.We divided the area into four   
 districts as follows:                 
                                       
 1 The new private estate(begun1979)   
 2 Chancery Close(council houses) built
   five years ago.                     
 3 Other houses in the village.        
 4 Houses outside the village.         
                                       
 We discovered that:                   
 1 Twenty one lived in catagory 1.     
 2 Twenty two lived in catagory 2.     
 3 Twenty three lived in catagory 3.   
 4 Eight lived in catagory 4.          
 We think there will soon be many more 
 in catagory 1 because there are more  
 than thirty children in play group and
 most of them live on the new estate.
