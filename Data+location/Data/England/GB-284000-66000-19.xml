		<title>19ABBOTSKERSWELL POSTMISTRESS</title>
		<content>  When we interviewed Mrs Fey B.E.M,the
 village postmistress, she told us that
 the post office was built 400 years   
 ago and that she came to work in the  
 post office 49 years ago.Mrs Fey      
 played the organ in church for 70     
 years .The post office times are as   
 follows: 9 a.m till 1 p.m.            
     then 2 p.m till 5.30 p.m.         
 Wednesday and Saturday are half       
 closing days.                         
  In the old days there was a man      
 called Mr Warren who ran a taxi from  
 Abbotskerswell to Newton Abbot and    
 that was 2 pence fare.Mrs Fey's       
 husband and his father helped to      
 rebuild the church.Mrs Fey likes the  
 village and wouldn't leave it if she  
 had the chance to, but one thing she  
 doesn't like about the village is the 
 new houses in Wilton Way and the      
 council houses.                       </content>
