 Rowhedge side of the river. {Wivenhoe 
{Port}employs    people and can handle 
 up to 500 ships a year, the largest of
 which is 250 feet long with a depth of
 l4 feet.  General cargoes include     
 timber, coal, steel, grain, fertiliser
 and animal feeds.  Most boats come    
 from the near Continent and the       
 Eastern Block countries.              
     {Rowhedge Quay}employs between 20 
 and 50 people and can handle up to 400
 ships a year.  Like{Wivenhoe Port}they
 handle general cargoe but specialise  
 in granite blocks for paving. The main
 cargoe going out is grain.  If they   
 are unloading animal feed and the wind
 is S.E. the smell overwhelms the      
 school!
