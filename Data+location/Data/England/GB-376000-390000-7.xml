		<content> Some children in our group did a      
 survey about what children do in their
 spare time. The results were quite    
 surprising. Just in the junior classes
 about 90% of the every class go       
 swimming or have swimming lessons.    
 Also quite a lot of children did other
 sports: running, darts, snooker,      
 football, ice and roller skating. So  
 most people like sport. Some people   
 like to do other things in their spare
 time like watching television, reading
 and making collections. However only  
 25% of the children enjoyed doing     
 this. Some people who liked swimming  
 cannot swim but go in anyway because  
 of the fun. Thre are three swimmimg   
 pools at Sale Leisure Centre. Many    
 people watch a lot of television but  
 they do not think of this as a "real" 
 hobby.
