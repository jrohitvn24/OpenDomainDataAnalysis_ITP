  The Milk Man comes round on his float
 at around 7.15 am.He gives us our milk
 and then drives on down the street.The
 float is electrically powered and runs
 on batteries.It has a cab at the front
 where the milkman sits.The rest of the
 space is taken up by a covered        
 compartment for carrying the milk     
 crates.Some milkmen also sell         
 cream,eggs,yoghurt,and bread.Every    
 Friday he collects the money.         </content>
