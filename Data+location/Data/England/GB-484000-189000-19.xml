		<content> Daws Hill Lane is residential.There   
 are 51 detached houses in the lane all
 built on one side of the road.In one  
 of these houses we talked to the owner
 who had lived there only six months.He
 lives there because it is handy for   
 his printing business in High         
 Wycombe.She is a beautician.They have 
 about an acre of garden and two       
 cars.Some of the people living in Daws
 Hill lane work in London.The houses   
 are pleasant with large rooms and 4 or
 five bedrooms.The houses are opposite 
 the American Air Base.
