		<content>{COWES GOLF CLUB}occupies forty acres  
 of land in between Baring Road and    
 Crossfield Avenue. It is a nine-hole  
 course with a par of 70 and the main  
 features are some very good par 3     
 holes.                                
 The 250 members enjoy the comfort of a
 very fine new club house which was    
 built in 1983 on a new site           
 overlooking the course and the Solent.
 This replaced the old one which was   
 burnt down following an electrical    
 storm.                                
 The two permanent green keepers have  
 the course in very good condition and 
 visitors are welcome to play on most  
 days of the week by paying the Â£5     
 green fee.                            
 Lunches are served daily during the   
 Spring and Summer months.
