		<title>17DOGMERSFIELD PARK AND LAKE</title>
		<content> To the west of Broad Oak lies the     
 Dogmersfield Park and Lake. The area  
 is a dense woodland with mature       
 deciduous trees. A minor road, off the
 A287, Farnham road, goes through the  
 parkland to Dogmersfield Village.     
 The entrance to the Park is near the  
 newly erected Amdahl House. It is     
 built on the site of the old          
 Dogmersfield House which was destroyed
 by fire. Amdahl House is the European 
 headquarters of an American-owned     
 company which manufactures electrical 
 goods. Part of the area, including the
 lake, belongs to the company. There is
 a boat-house near the lake and a weir 
 on the lake.                          
 There are two parish churches in the  
 area and a small number of houses. The
 Alder Valley bus service passes along 
 the A287, Farnham road, to Basingstoke
 and Farnham via Hook railway station.{</content>
