		<content> Our survey showed that 4 out of 5     
 households have at least one car, with
 2 in 5 having 2 or more vehicles.     
 Those with no transport rely,not only 
 on the infrequent buses, but also on  
 taxis, bicycles and the goodwill of   
 friends. Three separate bus companies 
 run services into Rushlake Green. From
 the south there is a roughly two      
 hourly service from Eastbourne via    
 Hailsham and Cowbeech. During school  
 term time this service is extended    
 twice a day to take and collect       
 children from Heathfield Secondary    
 school. A less frequent bus runs      
 through Punnets Town to Battle. Rail  
 travellers have an hourly opportunity 
 to catch trains at Etchingham,        
 Stonegate or Robertsbridge on the     
 Hastings to London line. The nearest  
 airport is Gatwick which can be       
 reached by road in about an hour.     </content>
