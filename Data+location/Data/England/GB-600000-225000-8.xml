 with about six players and a ball. One
 person throws the ball over their head
 and the others have to catch it. They 
 then hide the ball behind their backs 
 and the person "up" tries to catch    
 them out and guess who has the ball.

 Skipping with three or more people.   
 Two people hold the ends of an elastic
 loop while the others jump over it.   
{Doctor, Doctor.}This is played with   
 three or more people. One person is

 get themselves tangled up. The        
 "doctor" has to untangle them.        
{Bulldog.}Bulldog is played with three 
 or more people. One person is "it",
