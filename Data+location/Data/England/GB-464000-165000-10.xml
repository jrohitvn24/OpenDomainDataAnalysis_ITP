		<title>10TRANSPORT AROUND BURGHFIELD</title>
		<content> Burghfield Common lies on a ridge     
 about eight miles from Reading,the    
 county town of Berkshire.Many of the  
 inhabitants commute to work elsewhere,
 and require a good transport system.  
  In the village itself,the main roads 
 are Reading Road,Clayhill Road,and    
 Recreation Road.Two Alder Valley bus  
 services use these roads on the       
 Reading to Baughurst route.The nearest
 railway station is in Mortimer,where  
 trains run to Reading,to connect with 
 the national network,or to Basingstoke
 ,to connect with the southern network.
  Most Burghfield families have two or 
 more cars,and the national motorway   
 network can be accessed on the M4 at  
 either Three Mile Cross or at Theale. 
 The A4,or "Bath Road",runs through    
 Reading between London and Bath,and   
 can be reached from Burghfield by the 
 Reading (later Burghfield) Road.      </content>
