		<content>  700 years ago many people in the     
 village{worked on farms}or as         
 blacksmiths, wheelwrights and other   
 such jobs. Nowadays there are{large   
{factories in Haddenham}and many       
 people work in the village, although  
 not all of them live there.           
 As more people own cars, firms are    
 providing company vehicles and{people 
{are travelling 80km to work.}Since    
 1963, when the local station closed,  
 less people use trains to get to      
 work, but many{people who work locally
{are now cycling.                      
 There has been an increase in the     
 number of people who are{self employed
 although{selling products, industry   
{and education}are still the           
 three main jobs. Expanding industries 
 are{computing and communications.     
 The number of people who are          
 unemployed has increased.             </content>
