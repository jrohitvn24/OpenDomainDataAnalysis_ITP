		<title>13CROSS-COUNTRY, BEDGEBURY</title>
		<content>   Cross-country running is popular,   
 whether competitive (individual or    
 team), recreational or, for example,  
 as practice for marathons.            
   Bedgebury area is good for cross-   
 country running (or walking or riding)
 as it has many footpaths, tracks and  
 country roads; variety in forest,     
 field and parkland; and the gently    
 hilly terrain of the High Weald.      
   Bedgebury School has house and      
 school cross-country matches; joggers 
 use the roads and tracks; orienteering
 events are held in the Forest.        
   Competitive cross-country has rules,
 such as the English Schools' Athletic 
 Association's, governing distance for 
 age, scoring, course marking, race    
 control etc.  Junior boys (13-14) run 
 4-4.5 km, girls 2.5-3;  intermediates 
 (15-16) 5-5.5/3-3.5.  Winning team has
 lowest aggregate place-number score.  </content>
