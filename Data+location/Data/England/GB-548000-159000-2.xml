		<title>02The Rector in Halstead</title>
		<content>   Our{rector}is called Mr Bury .He    
 lives in Halstead but he looks after  
 two churches.{St Katharine's}in       
 Knockholt and{St Margaret's}in        
 Halstead. He says he has the{best job 
{in the world.                         
   His most important duty is to pray  
 for all the people in the two         
 villages. No one tells him what to do 
 so he has to decide for himself where 
 he is most needed. He has to do a lot 
 of travelling because sick people are 
 sent to many different hospitals in   
 the area. He also visits sad, bereaved
 people because they feel very sick    
 inside and need special care.         
   Mr Bury is responsible for the      
{Church of England School in Knockholt.
 He visits our school to tell us about 
 God.{Our rector is a very busy man.
