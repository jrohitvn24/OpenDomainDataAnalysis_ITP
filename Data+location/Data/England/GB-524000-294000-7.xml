		<title>07A large agricultural farm 1</title>
		<content>   I work on a large agricultural farm 
 the main crops we have are sugar-beet,
 potatoes and corn.                    
   We have various grain crops like    
 wheat and barley. The grain crop is   
 drilled between autumn and winter.    
 When it is ripe, we harvest the grain 
 crop.  We harvest it in late summer.  
 We use a Combine Harvester to gather  
 the grain. The grain is stored in     
 large bins, until it is collected by  
 lorries for milling or animal feed.   
   We should drill sugar-beet seed in  
 late March to April. One seed drill is
 used to  plant as many as 12 rows at a
 time.   We keep the crop weed free by 
 either hand/machine hoe or spray.  We 
 harvest the sugar_beet at the end of  
 September to the end of December.  The
 sugar_beet is left in large heaps by  
 the side of the road before collection
 by lorry.                             </content>
