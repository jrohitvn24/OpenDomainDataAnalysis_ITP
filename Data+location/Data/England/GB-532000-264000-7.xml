		<content> Boxworth Church, dedicated to St.Peter
 was built in the fourteenth century.  
 It is constructed mainly of flint and 
 stone in the  Decorated style.The     
 main communicants are people over     
 sixty years old, no children attend   
 Church. Marriage and baptism services 
 are rare. As with many other parishes,
 Boxworth is a shared parish, the vicar
 also has Elsworth, Knapwell and       
 Conington to look after. The vicar,the
 Reverend Hugh  Mosedale,  lives in    
 Boxworth in the vicarage, a very large
 building with extensive gardens full  
 of wild flowers.                      
 Roman Catholic communicants attend    
 Churches in Papworth and Cambridge.
