		<title>11CINEMA IN THE 1930'S</title>
		<content> Nelly Simpson now lives in Valley     
 House Old People's Home,Leicester.    
 In the 1930's she went to the pictures
 about once a week.She went to the     
 Belgrave cinema which was on the      
 Belgrave Road where an Indian cinema  
 is today.She could not remember the   
 first film she saw but it would       
 probably be in black and white and    
 silent.In those days a visit to the   
 cinema only cost a few pence.An organ 
 came up from the floor playing music  
 at the beginning of each show.Cinemas,
 then, were usually packed full of     
 people.During World War 2 the cinema  
 was very popular because of news reels
 which let people know what was going  
 on during the war.Nelly loved to go   
 the cinema with her friends and family
 because the atmosphere was like that  
 of a neighbourhood centre today.
