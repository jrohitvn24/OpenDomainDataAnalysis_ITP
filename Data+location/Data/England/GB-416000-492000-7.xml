		<content>{Hunton Methodist Chapel               
   There has been "a constant Christian
 witness" on this site since 1829.  The
 chapel is in the {Richmond circuit.}At
 present there  are 14 members, but the
 average  Sunday  morning attendance is
 about  eight. The Harvest Festival  is
 the main annual event and aids in fund
 raising. United services are also held
 monthly with St.John's congregation.  
   There  is  no Sunday school now, but
 an inter-denominational group  of Mums
 run a{Thursday Club}for young children
 in the  chapel school room.  Twelve of
 us are divided into two groups.We sing
 songs,have a Bible reading,do quizzes,
 hear a story and draw pictures. We end
 the meeting in a ring and say prayers.
   The{local Ladies' Choir}practices in
 the chapel on Wednesday evenings. They
 provide  enjoyable  entertainment   at
 functions around our area.            </content>
