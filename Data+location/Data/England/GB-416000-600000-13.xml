		<content> To the West of Felton is the Church of
 St.Michael's and All Angels. There is 
 no spire or tower but one tall western
 wall in which hangs the bell. The     
 church is built on a Saxon site and   
 the Chancel is said to have been built
 in the 13th century although the Old  
 Vicarage was much younger. The new    
 vicarage is in the new estate, Benlaw 
 Grove to the North of the village.    
 Further west is a small private Roman 
 Catholic chapel next to Felton Park   
 built in 1857. It was rededicated in  
 1983.The priest travels from a nearby 
 village to take public services.South 
 of the Coquet up a steep footpath is  
 the old Presbyterian Church built in  
 1820. The present church was built in 
 1924. The new Manse will be in Benlaw 
 Grove. On the main street there was a 
 Methodist Chapel. This is now being   
 converted into a house.               </content>
