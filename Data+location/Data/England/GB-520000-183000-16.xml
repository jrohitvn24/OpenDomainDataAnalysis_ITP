		<title>16BOMB EFFECTS ON HARLESDEN</title>
		<content>{Land mines and bombs}were explosive   
 devices that were used to blow up the 
 enemy.{The railways in Brent were the 
{worst hit.}Willesden Junction and     
 Harlesden Station each had an exploded
 land mine.                            
 During the{Second World War}in the    
 area of Park Parade, Rucklidge Avenue,
 Leghorn Road, Chomonley Avenue and    
 Radcliffe Avenue{5 land mines exploded
 and 5 were left unexploded. Drayton   
 Road and Harlesden Gardens had two    
 buildings destroyed.We went to Drayton
 Road and we discovered that houses    
 107-137 were all fairly new, so we    
 decided that must have been where the 
 bombs fell. We could find no evidence 
 of bomb damage in any of the other    
 streets because there seemed to be a  
 lot of very new houses.The people we  
 interviewed said they were{"too young 
{to remember".                         </content>
