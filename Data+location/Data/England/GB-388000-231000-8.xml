		<content>  Tewkesbury's character lies with the 
 black and white buildings of the town 
 and the many Alleys which join one    
 street to another.                    
  Most of the timber framed buildings  
 have a preservation order on them and 
 are all classed as listed buildings.  
 Although a lot of these buildings have
 now become business premises,they     
 still retain that 'Olde Worlde'       
 feeling that draws the many tourists  
 to Tewkesbury each year.              
  As mentioned,helping to retain this  
 character,we have the numerous Alleys 
 and several antique shops.Each        
 individual Alley is steeped in        
 history: such as Lilley's Alley which 
 once contained a malthouse and was a  
 place where clay pipes were put on    
 racks to dry.                         
                                       
                                       </content>
