		<title>11THE FIRE STATION</title>
		<content>  There are 19 personnel who contribute
 to the running of{Wymondham Fire      
{Station},all on a voluntary basis.    
 This team includes 1 Station Officer, 
 1 Sub-officer,4 Leading Firemen and   
 13 Firemen. All men must live or work 
 locally and be able to give day-time  
 cover between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. The   
 team operates on a shift basis so that
 the 2 fire engines are manned 24 hours
 a day.                                
  When an alarm is given from the      
 Central Station in Norwich, the       
 Wymondham personnel are immediately   
 notified by means of a pocket alerter.
 They should take no more than 4       
 minutes to leave the Station.In 1984  
 they were alerted 287 times,an average
 of 5 times a week. The fire engines   
 that are used are continually being   
 updated, although the equipment       
 carried remains basically the same.   </content>
