		<title>07FARMING IN FRILSHAM (1)</title>
		<content> There are 7 farms in these 12 sqKms.  
 They are all both{arable and dairy.}  
 They are neat and well cared for and  
 the buildings are sound.{Cereals}grown
 are{wheat and barley. Cows}are mostly 
{Fresians}which have a high milk yield.
 We saw no{sheep. Pigs}are kept in the 
 open sheltered in small huts.{Hens}are
 kept in battery houses. One farm has  
 2000 looked after by one man. Most    
 fields are{under 30 acres.}Stubble is 
 rarely burned as it is used for the   
 livestock and hedges are retained.    
 Workers still live on or near the farm
 but their numbers have decreased      
 sharply with the use of modern        
 machinery. Ploughing, sowing, reaping 
 and fertilising are all{mechanised.   
 Horses are little used for work. Farm 
 workers have a good standard of living
 and have excellent relationships with 
 farmers who look after them well.     </content>
