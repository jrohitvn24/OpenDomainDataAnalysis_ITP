		<title>09Morwenstow Historic Houses</title>
		<content> Almost any house of appreciable age in
 the area has claims to being historic.
 They range  from  traditional thatched
 cob to  medieval  manor house.  Coombe
 valley   contains  the  remains  of  a
 village with mill and a handful of    
 cottages all thatched. On the opposite
 hill is Stowe Barton  the ancient home
 of the  Grenvilles of  naval and civil
 war fame.  The present house  was once
 the stables of a greater dwelling.    
 Lee Barton mentioned  in the  original
 Domesday survives as a working farm.  
 Stanbury manor  celebrated  its  400th
 anniversary of rebuilding this year.  
 Here also are Ham with its nearby mill
 and Eastaway on  the site  of a former
 manor. Woodford has old cottages; Ovis
 pictured  with  Stowe  in  1680, still
 exists; Harscott  adjacent to  CSOS is
 now in ruins.  All  these  are private
 houses unavailable to the public.     </content>
