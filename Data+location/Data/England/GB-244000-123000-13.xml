		<content>I live on a farm with 1 brother and 1  
sister.We have a big house and a big   
garden and 1 field.In the summer holid-
ays we walk down the lane to get the   
newspapers.On either side of the lane  
are fields and the sides have wild flow
-ers growing in the hedges.Sometimes we
walk across the fields when the grass  
is being cut and there are paths of gra
-ss everywhere.After we have been for a
walk we collect the eggs from the chick
-ens and tidy up the house a little bit
We have 5 cows and 1 of them is for mil
-king and often has calves.It usually  
has 1 every year.When it has a calf we 
we are allowed to watch the vet pull it
out.We first see its hind legs and they
are covered in a bag of skin.The calves
are born in the field in summer and in 
the barn in winter.  Sarah Ford,Upcott.
