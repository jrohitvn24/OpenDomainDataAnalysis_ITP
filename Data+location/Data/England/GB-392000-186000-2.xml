		<title>02The Malmesbury Commoners</title>
		<content>    There are 285{Commoners}in         
 Malmesbury, all descendants of men who
 fought for{King Athelstan}at the      
{Battle of Brunanburg in 937 AD.       
 Athelstan, the Saxon King of Wessex,  
 gave the men of Malmesbury a share of 
 700 acres of land}as a reward         
 for their part in the defeat of the   
 Danes. They could farm or graze       
 animals on this land. The right to    
 become a Commoner was passed down from
 father to son, and a ceremony is still
 held when a Malmesburian becomes a    
 Commoner. He has to stand on a piece  
 of turf from the common and is hit on 
 the back with a hazel stick while     
 someone says{"Turf and twig I give    
{to thee, as King Athelstan gave to    
{me."}He then receives a share of the  
 annual rent on the land, but ceases to
 be a Commoner if he moves out of      
 Malmesbury.                           </content>
