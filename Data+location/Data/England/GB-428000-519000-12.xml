		<title>12Transport around Brafferton</title>
		<content>    This area is served by two main    
 roads, which are the A1(M) and the    
 A167.                                 
                                       
    The{motorway}was upgraded about 15 
 years ago and is the main link between
 the North-East and London. Regular    
 Express Coaches use this route from   
 Newcastle to the South. However the   
 motorway apparently has had little    
 direct effect on the residents in the 
 area.                                 
                                       
    It is the{A167}running between     
 Durham, Newton Aycliffe and Darlington
 that carries most of the local        
 traffic. It is a very busy road and   
 considered a very dangerous one       
 particularly at the turn-off to       
 Brafferton.
