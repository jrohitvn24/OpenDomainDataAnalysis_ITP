		<title>08WIMBLEBALL RESERVOIR</title>
		<content> The Withiel Florey stream enters from 
 the north.                            
  Wimbleball Lake was opened for       
 fishing on the 1st May,1980. Since    
 then 85,000 trout have been caught.The
 largest up to date was a rainbow trout
 weighing 8lb 8oz. Wimbleball Lake     
 offers three types of trout rainbow,  
 brown and tiger.                      
 There are three main car parks, a     
 picnic site and a childrens adventure 
 playground on the shores of the lake. 
 Car parking is 20p a day.             
 There is an information centre at     
 Cowlings on the west shore of the lake
 and here refreshments are available   
 from a mobile kiosk. This is in fact  
 one of only two places where you can  
 buy food in this. The kiosk sells     
 coffee (large polystyrene cups of it -
 very good), ice cream, hot soup,      
 sandwiches, sweets etc.               </content>
