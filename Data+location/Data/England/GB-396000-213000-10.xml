		<title>10Buses</title>
		<content> There is one daily bus route in our   
 area the X51, which runs to Cheltenham
 to Cirencester and Swindon. I found   
 out that not many  people use the     
 buses. I think it is because if the   
 people had lots of shopping they would
 have to walk about 0.75 km to get to  
 the bus stop which is on the main A435
 and when you get there it may be gone 
 or not there yet.Nearly all the people
 said they did not use the bus because 
 it comes every 2 hours which is not   
 very convenient and so you would have 
 a very long walk back if you missed   
 it.There is a new bus called the{     
{Tuesday Bus.}It always runs on a      
 Tuesday.It comes right into the       
 village.Still,only one person uses    
 it.It goes to different villages.More 
 people get on the bus in these other  
 villages.It stops outside the{Post    
{Office.}If no-one boards it drives on.</content>
