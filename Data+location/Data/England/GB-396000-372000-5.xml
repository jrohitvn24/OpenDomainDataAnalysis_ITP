{Geology}- The land area is formed of  
 millstone grit which is made up of    
 shale, sandstone and gritstone.  This 
 rock structure and the associated     
 scenery is readily appreciated by the 
 many visitors to the area.  The upland
 scenery consists of sombre moorlands, 
 which because of their poor drainage  
 have accumulated thicknesses of peat  
 and poor quality vegetation.  The     
 lower areas have been improved by the 
 spreading of lime to reduce the soil  
 acidity making the land suitable for  
 cattle as well as sheep.              
                                       
 The animals graze in enclosures       
 bounded by dry-stone walls which are a
 significant feature of the area. The  
 stone was quarried locally, there now 
 being no working quarries nearby.     </content>
