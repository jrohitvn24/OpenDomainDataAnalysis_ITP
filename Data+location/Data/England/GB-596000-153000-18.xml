		<title>18TRANSPORT IN THROWLEY</title>
		<content>  There has been no public transport in
 Throwley for several years. The two   
 hourly bus service from Ashford to    
 Faversham can be caught at Leaveland  
 corner, 25 minutes walk away. The     
 journey to Faversham takes about ten  
 minutes. Very few people from the     
 village travel this way.              
  In the village 3 families do not have
 a car, and in 7 families there is only
 one driver. These people without      
 transport go to Faversham only once a 
 week and often rely on the neighbours.
  A taxi journey into town costs Â£4 one
 way.                                  
  A baker from Ospringe delivers bread 
 in the area, while the milkman, who   
 calls 5 days a week, also sells a     
 range of groceries. A mobile shop     
 (grocery and greengrocery) calls once 
 a week. A "Help the Aged" minibus     
 picks up elderly people on Wednesdays.</content>
