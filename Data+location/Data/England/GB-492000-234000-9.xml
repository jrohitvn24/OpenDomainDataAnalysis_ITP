		<title>09Ecology  Deer  Pheasants</title>
		<content>   The introduction of various species 
 of deer and game birds into the Woburn
 Estate has led to an interesting      
 change in the local ecology.The       
 Muntjac deer have wandered into the   
 Aspley Guise area and can be a        
 nuisance.                             
   "In the winter the deer come into   
 our gardens.  They come from the woods
 and from Woburn Park.  They eat       
 Tessa's roses, Emily's bulbs and      
 Mark's berries.  David has put a      
 spring on his gate to stop them       
 getting in, but they often jump over  
 the fences.  Some of the deer are     
 quite tame and Abigail keeps one as a 
 pet."  Class Two.                     
   There are colonies of Lady Amherst's
 Pheasants in the fields around the    
 villages. Many, unfortunately, become 
 road casualties. Others are regarded  
 as pests by the farming community.    </content>
