		<content> A survey of why people moved into the 
 Brookmans Park area  produced the     
 following results.                    
 High on the list of reasons for       
 selecting the Brookmans Park area is  
 the fact that it is connected by train
 to Moorgate and Kings Cross. The      
 centre of London is only forty to     
 fifty minutes away                    
 Another feature which attracts is the 
 fact that Brookmans Park is a pleasant
 village with adequate shopping        
 facilities.There are also good        
 connecting main roads to the larger   
 towns in the vicinty such as Stevenage
 and Welwyn Garden City                
 Education is regarded as important to 
 people moving into Brookmans Park and 
 the area has successful primary and   
 secondary schools.
