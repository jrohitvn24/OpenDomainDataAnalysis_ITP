		<content> THE GREYFRIAR'S FRANCISCAN MONASTERY  
 The Franciscan Monastery was opened in
 1892. At the moment there are only ten
 friars living there. The Franciscan   
 Friars own 4-5 acres of land. They    
 grow some of their own vegetables and 
 they own some chickens. In their      
 leisure time , they can read, watch   
 T.V., play sports, visit their        
 families and go for walks. For some of
 these activities they can change from 
 their habits into casual clothes.     
                                       
 Other organisations:The British Red   
 Cross Centre at Barnett Hill has been 
 there since 1946.It trains people in  
 Red Cross concerns from all over the  
 country.
