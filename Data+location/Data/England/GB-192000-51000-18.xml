		<content> Many stories are told about the area, 
 most famous being about Jan Tregeagle 
 ,said to have been chased through St. 
 Stephens by headless hounds. Ghost    
 stories are rare,but in Coombe we     
 heard of an old grey lady spirit seen 
 by the roadside.There are rumours of  
 a secret tunnel linking a local pub to
 St.Stephens Church.True stories still 
 told are about two seperate murders   
 that occurred over forty years ago,   
 and at the Kings Arms Inn there is a  
 photograph,one hundred years old,of   
 two men who badly bit each other in a 
 fight.Superstitions are common among  
 the old people,although not always    
 treated seriously.Magpies are always  
 respected:it is usual to greet a lone 
 Magpie with" Mornin Mr. Magpie."Other 
 superstitions are;not going through   
 the same door twice,and hanging       
 washingout in a certain day for luck. </content>
