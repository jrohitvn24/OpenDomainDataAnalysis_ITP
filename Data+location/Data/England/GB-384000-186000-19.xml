		<title>19THE COTSWOLD ROOF</title>
		<content> The traditional houses in the area are
{roofed with natural stone tiles,      
 originally quarried locally.  Nowadays
 only one small quarry still makes     
 stone tiles, so existing ones from    
 ruined buildings command a very high  
 price.                                
   {The tiles are graded in size,}the  
 largest being hung at the eaves,(some 
 can measure 1m by 0.5m) declining in  
 size up to the ridge, where they may  
 be only 15cm square. Once they were   
 hung on wooden pegs, they are now     
 nailed to battening, generally laid   
 over roofing felt.                    
    The tiler uses a small hammer to   
 chip the tiles to size so that smaller
 tiles can be made out of damaged old  
 ones.  In at least one family in      
 Sherston this{skill has been handed on
{from father to son.                   
                                       </content>
