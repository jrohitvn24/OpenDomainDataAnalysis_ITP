{TO BUILD THE NEW ONE. June 1985       
                                       
 They are building a new bridge over   
 the  east  coast railway line as a    
 part of the{electrification}scheme. It
 is bridge 140. The old bridge had 3   
 arches. They have put a Bailey bridge 
 while they are building the new       
 bridge. The workmen have to build the 
 bridge so that the farmer can get from
 one field to another. The workmen     
 think it will take 9 months to build. 
 The old bridge has been{blown up.}The 
 workmen had to have  straw on top of  
 the Porta-Cabins to protect them while
 the bridge was being blown up. The old
 bridge was made of blue engineering   
 bricks and the new bridge is being    
 made of concrete and steel.
