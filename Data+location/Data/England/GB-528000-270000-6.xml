		<title>06General Practitioner,St Ives</title>
		<content> This GP has been a doctor since 1969  
 and has worked in St Ives since 1973. 
 He works in a group practice because  
 he likes working with other doctors   
 and between them they can provide     
 better facilities for the patients.   
 There are four doctors in his         
 practice, three men and one lady.     
 One of the doctors works part time.   
 Altogether he has about 2500 patients.
 Usually he works one night a week and 
 one Saturday in two months. On average
 there is one emergency every day.     
 Sometimes he may get a patient with an
 illness he doesn't know about and has 
 to tell this to the patient. His      
 surgery opens at 9.00 am so he doesn't
 have to get up too early. If he is ill
 he usually treats himself but if he is
 worried he sees his own doctor.       
 Although it can be very wearing, he   
 enjoys his job immensely.             </content>
