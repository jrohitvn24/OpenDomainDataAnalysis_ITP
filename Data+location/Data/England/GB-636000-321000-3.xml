		<title>03BARTON BROAD</title>
		<content> Barton Broad is one of the largest    
 stretches of open water in Norfolk. It
 is very difficult to reach because it 
 is surrounded by alder carr and reed  
 beds. The margins are marshy with few 
 footpaths providing access. Much of   
 the fen is privately owned so entry is
 restricted. A route to the water can  
 be found across the fen from Woodend  
 Staithe. The River Ant flows through  
 the broad, the navigational channel   
 being marked by red and black poles.  
 As the broad is quite shallow the bed 
 of the river has often been dredged.  
 It is feared that the broad may become
 overgrown with reeds so that it       
 disappears in the same way that Sutton
 Broad has done. The broad is popular  
 with yachtsmen, canoeists and         
 holidaymakers.
