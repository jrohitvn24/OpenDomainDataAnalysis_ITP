		<title>15LOCAL AND NATIONAL ISSUES</title>
		<content> Over 55% of people regard unemployment
 as the greatest problem facing our    
 nation in the 1980s. The next most    
 important subject was violent crime,  
 many believe this to be due to a lack 
 of dicipline. Nuclear war was thought 
 to be the greatest problem by only 5% 
 of the people.                        
 At the top of the list of local       
 problems was the lack of street       
 lighting in the villages. Many wish to
 have better facilities for the young  
 and elderly, whilst a similar number  
 want to see the woodland and hedgerows
 managed better and not destroyed.     
 Improved roads and a ban on aerial    
 crop-spraying were also mentioned by  
 several people.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
