 plants,including orchids,and there are
 are over 200 types of butterflies and 
 moths.

 the main road,has only an infrequent  
 bus service.There is no local shop but
 the postman delivers shopping as well 
 as letters to an elderly lady.Snow is 
 a problem in winter.In 81/82 a car had
 to be left on the main road until     
 Easter.                               
 Some of the film'Cider with Rosie'was 
 made at Down Court.  {Marion Hearfield
