		<title>19St. Edith's Well</title>
		<content>Edith was born in Kemsing in A.D.901,  
the daughter of King Edgar and Lady    
Wulfrith.  She lived most of her short 
life as a nun in Wilton. When she died 
in A.D.984 there were reports of       
miracles.  These claims were examined  
and she was canonised.. Her feast is   
Sept. 16th.  In the Middle Ages a cult 
grew in Kemsing and a atatue was       
erected in the Churchyard.  Pilgrims   
stopped here en route to Canterbury.   
Her emblems are a wheatsheaf and a     
goblet of water representing powers of 
curing diseases of corn, and curative  
powers of water.  In the 16th. century 
the shrine was demolished but the well 
well remains.
