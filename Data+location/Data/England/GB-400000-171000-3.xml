		<title>03     A HOME IN CALNE</title>
		<content> My house has got central heating and a
 gas fire. We have got two TV's,one is 
 black and white but it is broken.We   
 have got a garage and a little back   
 garden. We have got a tree in the     
 front. We have a little apple tree and
 a pear tree. We had three bedrooms but
 my dad knocked a wall out to make it  
 bigger. My bedroom is going to be in  
 the loft. I am going to have a        
 cupboard under the stairs. We have a  
 little passage where the dog goes and 
 we can't get her out. My dad has put  
 planks up and painted them. It is a   
 semi-detached. It is the same as all  
 the ones in the street.
