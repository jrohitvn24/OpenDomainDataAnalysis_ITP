		<content> Langtoft is a very old village.It is  
 2.4 miles north of Market Deeping     
 along the A15.Langtoft runs East-West 
 over the A15 so it is split into two  
 sections known as East End and West   
 End.Both East and West Ends have      
 new,small housing estates.In the East 
 End there is a big playing field which
 has a football pitch and swings ect.  
 for the smaller children.There is a   
 church,it is called St.Michael's And  
 All Angels.It was built in the        
 1200s.Just past the crossroads on the 
 West End there is a Butcher's         
 shop,post office,hairdressers and the 
 village shop.A bit further up the     
 village there is the village hall.On  
 the big field beside the new housing  
 estate in Manor Way a new school is in
 process of being built to replace     
 the old school,built in 1859.It is due
 to be finished in the summer of 1986. </content>
