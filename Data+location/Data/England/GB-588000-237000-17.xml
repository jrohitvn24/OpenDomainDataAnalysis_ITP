This story tells of a day in September 
1449, when the people of Little Cornard
were alarmed by a rumbling noise       
coming from the meadows next to the    
River Stour.They nervously crept       
towards the river and were amazed to   
see, by the curve of the meadows, a    
huge beast red and spotted with dark   
eyes with a long spiny tail.In an      
opposite corner of the meadows stood   
another beast, all shiny black, with an
enormous flabby body .The two beasts   
fought each  other fiercely for over   
an hour and then each stopped .The red 
one went towards Essex and the black   
one stayed in Suffolk.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
