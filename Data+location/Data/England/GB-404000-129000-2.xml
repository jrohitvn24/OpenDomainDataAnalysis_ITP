		<title>02BARFORD ST. MARTIN VILLAGE</title>
		<content>  Barford St. Martin is a small village
 with a parish church, small village   
 shop and post office which sells a    
 wide range of items, public house, and
 first school all in close proximity to
 one another at the eastern end of the 
 village. Houses are mainly detached,  
 some are very large with four or more 
 bedrooms. Although many maintain a    
 rustic appearance, being stone and    
 often thatched, they are highly       
 modernised, affording a high standard 
 of living.                            
  It is now a linear village, spreading
 along the B road to Tisbury with a    
 fairly large council estate at the    
 western end. There is a children's    
 play area near here.                  
  Apart from the small village shop,   
 most shopping is undertaken in either 
 Wilton or Salisbury. People also go to
 these places for entertainment.       </content>
