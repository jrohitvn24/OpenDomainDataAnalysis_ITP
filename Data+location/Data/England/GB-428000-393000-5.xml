		<content> The area west of the river Don is     
 mostly farmland.The farms are small   
 and consist mainly of sheep rearing,  
 due to the steepness of the land. Some
 crops are grown, mainly for cattle    
 feeding.There are a few farms on the  
 lower slopes which rear beef cattle   
 and some which run small dairy herds. 
 The farms are mostly family concerns  
 using very little outside labour.     
 Young teenagers are employed to help  
 with harvesting and crop lifting.
