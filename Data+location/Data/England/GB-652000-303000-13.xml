		<title>13The Harbour</title>
		<content> The southern end of Yarmouth port lies
 within this survey area. The present  
 entrance dates from the early 17th    
 century, a cut being made here across 
 the long sand spit extended to Corton.
 The present south side of the right   
 angled entrance is Gorleston Pier on  
 which stands the coastguard station.  
 The tidal range is only 1.8 metres in 
 the harbour which allows ships to     
 enter at most states of the tide, but 
 the minimum depth being only 4.3      
 metres restricts the tonnage of       
 vessels to about 4000, with a length  
 of 50 metres. Navigating the entrance 
 at Brush Bend is difficult, so pilots 
 must assist unless the ship's captain 
 is experienced. Captains of the North 
 Sea Ferries pilot them in themselves.
