		<title>19STRONGSTRY -- REDEVELOPMENT</title>
		<content>{Strongstry}is a small industrial      
 hamlet on the banks of the{River      
{Irwell.}It was built in the middle    
 years of the nineteenth century by the
 Porritt family,local millowners who   
 lived at The Cliffe,Stubbins,as       
 housing for the workers in their      
 textile mills.After many years of     
 neglect,during which the stone        
 cottages gradually fell into          
 disrepair,they have recently been     
 acquired by a housing association for 
 redevelopment. Back-to-back cottages  
 have been remodelled to provide modern
 and spacious accommodation.The hamlet 
 has been designated as a Conservation 
 Area,and is situated in a fine        
 landscaped setting. The Porritt family
 home has recently been converted into 
 a rest-home for the elderly,while the 
 rest of the estate is controlled by   
 the National Trust.                   </content>
