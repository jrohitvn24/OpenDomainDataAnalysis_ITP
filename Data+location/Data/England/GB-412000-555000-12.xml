		<title>12DERWENT VALLEY - WILD LIFE</title>
		<content> Many members of the tit family are    
 well represented; common blue, great  
 and long-tailed tits, also the rarer  
 coal, marsh and willow tits and the   
 nuthatch. Summer visitors include     
 redstart, chiffchaff, willow and      
 garden warbler, blackcap and,         
 occasionally, the grasshopper warbler.
 Hawfinch and goldfinch are increasing 
 in numbers. Goldcrest, crossbill,     
 woodcock, green and great spotted     
 woodpeckers have Chopwell Woodlands as
 their favourite locality. In the      
 Hamsterley Mill area, the much rarer  
 lesser spotted woodpecker is found.   
 One noticeable newcomer, the collared 
 dove, is now common here.             
 Chopwell Woodlands' ponds, formed by  
 German bombing in the 2nd World       
 War,contain all 3 species of British  
 newts. Pond drainage means toads and  
 frogs are less common.                </content>
