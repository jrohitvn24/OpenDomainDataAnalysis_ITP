		<title>09FARMING IN THE AREA</title>
		<content> The area covered by this D-block is   
 chiefly rural and much of it used for 
 farming .Cereal crops are grown mainly
 on the flatter land by the A.19 and   
 also on the sheltered slopes of the   
 moorland valleys.On the gently sloping
 sides of these valleys,the land-cover 
 is chiefly grassland and both dairy   
 and meat-producing cattle graze       
 there.Nearer the tops of these valleys
 the land becomes steeper and there is 
 more rough pasture.Sheep graze here   
 and also on the higher moorland.Some  
 sheep are brought down to the lower   
 land in winter,but many remain on the 
 moors all year round and seek shelter 
 by dry-stone walls or in gullies.Most 
 farmers in the area practise mixed    
 farming having both sheep and cattle  
 and some arable land for crops.
