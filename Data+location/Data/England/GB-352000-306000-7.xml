		<content>{The Parish Church,}part of{Hereford   
{Diocese,}with its{Saxon Font}and oak  
 effigy of{Ould Scriven}is built of red
 sandstone and with fossil tiles on the
 tower roof. The weathercock fell down 
 in a storm last year. Pigeons are     
 creating problems messing on the tower
 and the sandstone is flaking in parts.
 The{churchyard}is in 2 sections. The  
 N. part of the old churchyard has been
 cleared of all its illegible stones   
 and the new churchyard is almost full.
 Part of this churchyard is being made 
 as a{Garden of Rest}for the remains of
 cremated ashes. A{chalice and patten  
 valued at Â£5000 is in the Treasury at 
 Hereford. A Quota payment of Â£2500p.a.
 to the Diocese as well as the running 
 and maintenance{costs}of the Church   
 has put pressure on the P.C.C. and the
 low number of church attenders to find
 the necessary income.                 </content>
