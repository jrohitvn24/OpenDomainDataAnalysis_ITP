 They wired houses for electricity in  
 1935, but not for everybody. During   
 the war there was a blackout - no     
 lights showing at night. The lavatory 
 was outside and did not flush until   
 1950. They had taps but not hot. They 
 heated the water in an old fashioned  
 boiler over a fire.                   
{1965                                  
 They had inside lavatories, bathrooms 
 and taps with hot and cold. Most      
 houses had electricity and there were 
 electric street lights.               
{1985                                  
 We have inside lavatories, bathrooms  
 and showers. Our taps have hot and    
 cold. We heat our water with immersion
 heaters, boilers and Agas. We can have
 a bath when we want and use washing   
 machines, tumble driers and           
 dishwashers. We all have electricity. </content>
