		<content>There are many different languages in  
B'ham. There are many languages spoken 
in Sparkbrook. My mother doesn't know  
any english. She speaks Sylheti which  
is a dialect of Bengali. At home we    
translate for her. My dad understands  
a little bit of english. My mother only
visits Bengali households. In          
Sparkbrook one hears Bengali, Urdu,    
Hindi, Punjabi, Mirpuri, Gujerati and  
many more. When I went to Nursery I was
frightened as I didn't know what to do.
When a letter comes from Bangladesh    
written in english I translate it. My  
grandmother only speaks Bengali. She   
daydreams about Bangladesh a lot.      
       We would like to see more       
community centres in Sparkbrook where  
our parents could go to learn english.
