		<title>02Yarm Town Hall</title>
		<content> The Town Hall was built in 1710 by {  
{Viscount Fauconberg,}who was one of   
 the Lords of the Manor.Before the     
 arches were bricked up in 1878 a      
 market was held inside,then in 1957   
 the toilets were built. In 1925 the   
{Clapham brothers}decided to buy the   
 Town Hall from the Lord of the Manor, 
 later on they decided to give it to   
 the{Parish Council}and they now use it
 for their meetings. On the top of the 
 Town Hall there is a clock with a big 
 bell which is rung every hour.There is
 also a flag pole and a flag is hoisted
 on a Royal occasion. Also on top there
 is a {Windvane}with the date when the 
 Town Hall was built (1710).The steps  
 up to the Town Hall are the original  
 steps and lead to the room where the  
 Parish council meet.                  
                    There is a{war     
{memorial}beside the Town Hall.        </content>
