		<content>     There are many different clubs on 
 Sheppey. Our 1st and 2nd years wrote  
 about the clubs they go to.           
     The most popular{recreation}is    
{horse riding}with 4 schools to choose 
 from.                                 
     There are 16{clubs}which only 1 or
 2 girls in the 1st or 2nd year go to  
 such as St.John's Ambulance Brigade;  
 Karate;Judo;Squash;Piano;Computers;   
 Orienteering;Swimming and Pool.       
      The second most popular club is  
{Majorettes}and a new group has just   
 started.One of the main things the    
 girls enjoy are the competitions.     
       Brownies and Guides are quite   
 popular and there are quite a lot of  
 groups on Sheppey.                    
       A few girls go to the Leisure   
 Centre and use the facilities there   
 particularly for roller skating and   
 some go to various dancing clubs.     </content>
