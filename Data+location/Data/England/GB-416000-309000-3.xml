We did a survey on the houses in       
Elford.We discovered that there are    
116 houses in the village.The largest  
group of 34 were all built 12 years    
ago.There are 35 that were built over  
a hundred years ago.There are lovely   
old black and white timbered cottages  
and restored old buildings.The         
following names refer to the history   
of the buildings or village.They are-: 
School,The School house,Paget House,The
Stables,The Mill House,The Forge,The   
Black and White Cottage,Park Farm and  
Raddle Farm.Lichfield District Council 
have built several old people's flats  
and bungalows.I live at 1 Stubby Leas  
cottages in Fisherwick just out of     
Elford near an old people's Rest Home. 
There is a wood next to our house      
called the Fisherwick Wood.
