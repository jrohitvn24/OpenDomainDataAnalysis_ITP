		<title>14HERONTYE HOUSE</title>
		<content> Herontye House off Stuart Way, East   
 Grinstead is a magnificent manor house
 built in 1912 for $30000. It is now a 
 listed building. It was originally    
 built on an 1q acre site and stone    
 used in the mullions and archways was 
 quarried nearby. The house was built  
 by H &amp; E Waters of Forest Row, still a
 thriving business in 1985. Lord       
 Glendyne moved into the house in 1926 
 and in 1972, following his death,the  
 estate was sold to Wates, a major     
 building firm, for housing development
 Herontye House now has an acre garden 
 and is the headquarters of the        
 international consulting engineers    
 BMMK Cotterell. It is a typical       
 example of the grounds of a large     
 house being used for smaller housing  
 units. The old house is now surrounded
 by houses, cars, children, washing    
 lines etc. instead of trees &amp; fields. </content>
