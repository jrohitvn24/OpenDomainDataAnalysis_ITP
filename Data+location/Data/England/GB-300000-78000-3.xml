		<content> We spoke to Mr. Mingo who lives in    
 Bond Cottage. Mr Mingo has been       
 retired for some years. He is grey    
 haired, and carries a shooting stick. 
 He has lived in Bond Cottage for 20   
 years. It is 700 years old and is     
 owned by Clinton Estates.It has no    
 electricity but gas lighting. It's on 
 mains water,but there are also wells. 
 Bond Cottage was 2 Cottages at one    
 time, but is now just 1 cottage. It   
 has a rayburn and a calor gas cooker. 
 At the front of the house there is a  
 good sized garden. He lets this along 
 with his other 1 3/4 acres for grazing
 sheep and cattle. The outhouses were  
 used as a milking parlor, but they are
 not safe now.                         
 Gore Lane's name came from a slaughter
 house along the lane from Bond        
 Cottage. It was demolished some time  
 ago.                                  </content>
