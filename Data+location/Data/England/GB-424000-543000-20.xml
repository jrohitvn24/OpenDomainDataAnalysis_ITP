 a rectangular shaped court with a     
 shaded area inside it.2 teams of 10   
 players take part.Each team selects a 
 captain who goes to the opposite end  
 that his team are at.He stands outside
 the shaded area and waits for his team
 to get the ball over the halfway line 
 to him.Once the captain or king has   
 got the ball he has to try and hit    
 members of the opposing team below the
 knee.If a player is hit he must then  
 go and help his king.The first team to
 become all kings loses the game.
