		<content>{OLD PATCHAM.}The houses inchurch Hill 
 (which is the oldest part of Patcham) 
 were detatched,semi-detatched or      
 terraced.The bottom of the hill seemed
 to be a bit older than the top.Fronts 
 of the houses were made of flint from 
 the middle downwards,otherwise they   
 were cement rendered.Not many houses  
 had garages.The houses had very small 
 yards or gardens.Patcham Square       
 contained very old flint built houses.
{LADIES MILE ESTATE.}The houses are all
 detached or semi-detached and many are
 bungalows.They were built in the      
 1930's and show typical features such 
 as carved windows and arches.The      
 typical price new would be about Â£499 
 freehold!The houses are all privately 
 owned and have garages and large      
 gardens(Many have had considerable    
 improvements such as extensions.)
