		<content> Up to fairly recent times, everyone   
 knew everybody else in their village. 
 Most had been born there, worked      
 locally and many could trace their    
 roots in the locality back for several
 generations.                          
    A major concern among the villagers
 is that this is all changing. In the  
 10 years from 1971 to 1981 the number 
 of houses increased by nearly 25% and 
 a further 200 houses are to be built  
 in Eaton Bray alone - mainly on the   
 site of the old Wallace Nurseries     
 that used to provide local employment.
    Population growth has been well    
 over 30% since 1961 with Edlesborough 
 more than doubling from 547 to over   
 1100 and Eaton Bray up over 50% from  
 1509 to around 2300.                  
    Most of the recent new houses have 
 been relatively expensive, 4-bedroom, 
 detached,'executive-style' homes.     </content>
