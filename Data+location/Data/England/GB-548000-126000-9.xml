		<title>09OIL IN HIGH HURSTWOOD</title>
		<content> There has been alarm in the South East
 corner of our block where, after long 
 discussions, permission has been given
 by the County Environment Committee   
 for an oil company to explore for oil 
 and natural gas. The permission covers
 a period of two years and also        
 provides for an access road. There is 
 apparently a 50/50 chance of oil being
 discovered. Environmentalists are     
 concerned about the appearance of the 
 site and the possible traffic hazards 
 during exploration although they are  
 conscious of the country's need for   
 more oil and gas. If oil is found     
 there will obviously be a great deal  
 of controversy on this subject. Round 
 the clock drilling is expected to take
 between four and six weeks.           
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
