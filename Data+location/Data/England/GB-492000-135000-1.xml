		<content> Much of this block consists of        
 woodland with a number of small farms 
 now mainly growing grass for grazing  
 sheep, horses and cattle.  The western
 part contains the southern part of    
 Witley Park.  From certain places the 
 views towards Hindhead and Blackdown  
 are striking.  The main railway-line  
 from London to Portsmouth goes through
 the block with a fairly steep gradient
 going south-west towards Haslemere.   
 The southeastern corner includes the  
 western part of Chidding Fold.  With  
 Witley station in the block many      
 residents are commuters to London     
 with others working locally.  A few   
 work at the old-established stick     
 factory near the station, an important
 producer of sticks for walking and for
 hospitals. Near the station there is  
 also a small residential area.
