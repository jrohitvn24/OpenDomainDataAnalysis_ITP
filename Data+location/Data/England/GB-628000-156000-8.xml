		<title>08 CHURCH OF ST NICHOLAS, ASH</title>
		<content> In the church yard, the oldest grave  
stone we found was dated 1705.There is 
a Garden of Remembrance for ashes.On   
the outside of the church there are    
four carved faces.The glass doors on   
the porch are from the new school.     
There used to be metal railings around 
the tombs but in the war they were     
taken away to be made into guns.       
 We went up to the vestry and saw the  
Parish Records,the oldest dated 1558.  
The Lord Chancellor's Briefs show that 
in 1709 Ash Parish gave to a Montreal  
fire disaster fund P5/5s/5d.In 1977,Ash
needed money to rehang the bells so the
archivist wrote to all the parishes    
that Ash had helped and the people of  
Montreal sent 3,500 pnds to the appeal.
 The building is mainly C13th though   
partly C12th.It has many fine brasses &amp;
monumental effigies,two date from 1310,
a C15th wooden coffer &amp; 1727 poorbox.  </content>
