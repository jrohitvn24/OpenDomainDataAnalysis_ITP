		<title>04THE CIVIL WAR AT ORMSKIRK</title>
		<content> During the Civil War, Ormskirk was to 
 witness the only time in it's history 
 when military action affected the     
 area.                                 
    James, Lord Strange, The Earl of   
 Derby had the power to raise troops   
 and he raised a large force which he  
 deployed on the moor at Ormskirk.     
 General Egerton had a smaller force   
 stationed at Ormskirk and the two     
 sides met on Aughton Moss on August   
 20th 1635. The Parliamentarians won   
 the day and as result of this a local 
 farm now bears the name Trenchfield   
 Farm.                                 
    In recent years armour and weapons 
 have been found at the site of the    
 battle with the battle field itself   
 being now used for agriculture.       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
