{Methodist    (5)  House Church Group  
{Roman Catholic    Jehovah's Witness

 The area offers the residents a wide  
 variety of places of worship but all  
 christian organisations. Many of the  
 churches are very much the{'local'    
 church, especially Burncross Methodist
 where people attend because it is the 
 only church nearby. The community is  
 well provided for by many             
 organisations using the churches as   
 meeting places.The churches are{very  
{keen that they be seen as working     
{together}and not as totally seperate  
 organisations. This is done by        
 St.Johns (Church of England) and      
 Chapeltown methodist holding regular  
 united services.
