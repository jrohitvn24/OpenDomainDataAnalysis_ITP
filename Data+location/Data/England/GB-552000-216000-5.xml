		<title>05Hatfield Broad Oak Manors</title>
		<content>   In former times the parish of       
 Hatfield Broad Oak had several manor  
 houses. In the village itself the old 
 high brick wall on the south side of  
 the High Street between the school and
 Brick House used to enclose the       
 grounds of Hatfield Bury, an ancient  
 manor which was eventually pulled down
 about 1850.                           
   Barrington Hall, which stands in an 
 extensive park to the north of the    
 village partly on the site of the     
 priory, was occupied until 1836 by    
 members of the Barrington family. It  
 then passed to Mr. George Lowndes, who
 in 1861 gave the land on which the    
 school was built and in 1863 renovated
 and considerably altered the house.   
 From 1908 until 1976 the Gosling      
 family were in residence but since    
 then the Hall has been used as the    
 offices of a perfume company.         </content>
