		<content>      SHEERNESS IS A BUSY GENERAL      
 IMPORT/EXPORT DOCK.IN 1985 THERE ARE  
 JUST OVER 1000 PEOPLE CONNECTED WITH  
 SHEERNESS DOCKS.                      
      SHEERNESS DOCKS HANDLE MANY      
 DIFFERENT IMPORTS AND EXPORTS. THE    
 MAIN ONES ARE:IMPORTS - JAPANESE      
 CARS,FROZEN MEAT,FRUIT,FOREST PRODUCTS
 FOR PAPER.  EXPORTS - CHEMICALS,STEEL,
 MEDICINES.                            
      THE DOCKYARD SOMETIMES HAS SLACK 
 PERIODS DUE TO THE SEASONAL NATURE OF 
 FRUIT PRODUCTION WHILE PEOPLE WORKING 
 ON THE CAR SECTION HAVE A STEADY JOB  
 THE WHOLE YEAR THROUGH.               
      IN SHEERNESS DOCKYARD WORK IS    
 VERY PHYSICALLY HARD AS THEY HAVE VERY
 FEW MACHINES.IT CAN ALSO BE DANGEROUS 
 DUE TO THE CRANES WHICH WORK OVERHEAD 
 AND FORKLIFT TRUCKS CARRYING GOODS TO 
 AND FROM THE BOATS.                   
                                       </content>
