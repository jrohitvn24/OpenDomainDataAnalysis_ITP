		<content> One of the oldest houses in Plaistow  
 is{Todhurst Manor.     }It has some   
 very old features of stone with later 
 additions of brick. It has a fine barn
 built entirely of of wood with a clay 
 tiled roof.                           
{Plaistow Place was built in 1620.}It  
 was originally quite a small house,   
 but has been added to over the years. 
 Now it has eight bedrooms, two        
 bathrooms, a kitchen and four other   
 rooms. It also has a clock workshop.  
 In the cellar there are supposed to be
 tunnels to Loxwood, the church, and   
 to another old house in Plaistow      
 called "Quennels".                    
{The Council Estate, built below Nell  
{Ball,}is thirty years old and consists
 of 30 houses and 12 flats. A group of 
 20 Polish people live there. They came
 over to Britain after the war.
