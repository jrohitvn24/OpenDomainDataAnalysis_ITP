		<content> There are two schools in our area, one
 at Kirby Hill and the other in        
 Skelton. Both schools arw voluntary   
 controlled Church of England Schools. 
 They both take children from 5 to 11. 
 The children from Skelton are in the  
 area of the Ripon Secondary Schools   
 and are assessed under the Thorne     
 Scheme for their suitability to attend
 the Ripon Grammar School but most     
 parents ask for their children to     
 attend the Secondary school in        
 Boroughbridge which is a comprehensive
 school. It is this school,            
 Boroughbridge High School, to which   
 the children from Kirby Hill School   
 transfer at the age of 11.
