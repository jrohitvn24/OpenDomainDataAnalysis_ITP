		<title>03AN IMMIGRANT VIEW OF BURTON</title>
		<content>                                       
  Ahmed came from Rawalpindi, Pakistan,
when he was twelve years old, not      
through poverty, but because his       
parents were already here. He settled  
down very easily in Britain,and speaks 
English very well, although his wife   
has trouble with the language.         
  He got work easily, and gets on well 
with his work-mates. Ahmed feels close 
to English people, and finds no        
trouble with racism. His neighbours,   
in fact,are Germans!                   
  Burton  Â£is a very quiet town' -     
just a place to live, although he      
feels quite at home here. The family   
eat English food, although they have a 
largely vegetarian diet unless the     
meat is killed in the Muslim way.      
  He would go back to Pakistan Â£if he  
won the pools'.
