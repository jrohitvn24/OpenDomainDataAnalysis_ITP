		<content> Most of the houses in our area are    
 less than thirty years old.The houses 
 nearest the school are all part of a  
 large council estate.There are two and
 three bedroomed family homes and      
 one bedroomed flats and bungalows     
 specially designed for old age        
 pensioners or people living alone.The 
 roads on the estate are narrow        
 because the architects never          
 anticipated ordinary people owning    
 cars and there are very few garages.  
 The boom in electricial goods has     
 meant that many people have had more  
 sockets fitted to their homes as the  
 houses only had two electric sockets  
 downstairs when they were built.Each  
 house has a front and back garden and 
 like the houses themselves they are   
 very well cared for.The estate looks  
 very good and certainly does not look 
 as old as it is.                      </content>
