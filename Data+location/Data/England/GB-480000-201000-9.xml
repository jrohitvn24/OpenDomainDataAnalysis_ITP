		<content>The building industry has grown with   
the housing increase over the past     
twenty five years. Quite a high        
percentage of the working population   
are employed in building, many work    
into London and the adjoining counties.
There are several compaines who employ 
over twelve operatives, but in the main
it is a local industry of small        
operatives of two or three workers.    
The current yellow pages directory     
shows twenty one firms or individuals  
trading as builders.                   
Their names are well known locally and 
their reputation spreads well beyond   
this small country market town.        
These local builders have been         
responsible for much of the modern     
housing in the area which ranges from  
Georgian style, through detached and   
semiu detached on open plan estates to 
maisonettes and single person flats.   </content>
