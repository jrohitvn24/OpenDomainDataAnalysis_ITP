 people in the village have bikes,     
 BMX's or both. This Venn Diagram shows
 our results.{

 Cycles are popular in this area       
 because activities are near by, the   
 ground is flat and it is not worth    
 getting a car out for short trips.    
  Out of 203 people in our junior      
 school, 15 of them have no bike or    
 BMX. 205 of their parents had a bike  
 out of a possible total of 406. A BMX 
 is a light weight scrambling bike     
 which can cost Â£100-Â£1000. There is a 
 BMX club in Royston.                  </content>
