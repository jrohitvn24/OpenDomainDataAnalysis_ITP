In Whitton Green Primary School 128    
children have got pets and 39 have no  
pets. Altogether there are 75 dogs,325 
fish, 58 cats, 43 rabbits, 21 budgies, 
11 hamsters, 14 gerbils, 14 tortoises, 
6 horses, 17 mice, 62 pigeons and 2    
guinea pigs all kept as pets.          
I have a gentle chestnut-coloured horse
called Tilly. She is 14.2 hands high   
and has a white blaze down her nose.   
She eats bran and hay and drinks water.
My cat, Mizzy, has black and white fur 
and drinks milk. She will not chase    
birds but will scratch you if teased.  
Flash, my tortoise, is 34 years old. It
has scales on its head, tail and legs. 
Its shell is dark green. It eats fruit,
lettuce and tomato. My alsatian dog    
called Ching is 11 years old. She is   
well trained &amp; does not bark a lot.    
Ching likes dog biscuits &amp; long walks. </content>
