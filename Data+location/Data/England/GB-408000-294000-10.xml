 MY HOUSE IS IN MOORFIELD DRIVE, SUTTON
 COLDFIELD. IT IS ONE OF MANY HOUSES IN
 THE DRIVE WHICH ALL LOOK SIMILAR.     
 THE FRONT GARDEN HAS A LARGE PATCH OF 
 GRASS WITH TWO TREES, A CONCRETE DRIVE
 AND A{CRAZY PAVING}PATH. THE GARAGE   
 DOOR IS BRIGHT YELLOW AND SO IS THE   
 FRONT. THERE ARE USUALLY TWO CARS     
 OUTSIDE, A RED FIAT AND A BLACK METRO.
 THERE IS A WHITE GATE AT THE SIDE OF  
 THE HOUSE LEADING TO THE BACK GARDEN  
 WHICH HAS A BROWN FENCE AROUND THE    
 PERIMETER. IN THE BACK GARDEN THERE IS
 A FAIR SIZED LAWN WITH FLOWER BEDS IN 
 STONE WALLS LEADING HIGHER UP TO THE  
 TOP WHERE THE FENCE IS. THERE IS ALSO 
 A GATE WHERE THE LAWN MOWER, GARDEN   
 TOOLS, PLANTS, POTS, AND A HOSE PIPE  
 IN IT. BY THE SHED A CLIMBING FRAME   
 AND SWING STAND ON A PATCH OF UNWEEDED
 GROUND. OUR HOUSE IS SEMI-DETACHED.   </content>
