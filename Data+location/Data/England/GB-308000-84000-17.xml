		<title>17HOUSING SURVEY IN OTTERTON</title>
		<content> The{Clinton Estate}once owned nearly  
 all the houses in Otterton.Now they   
 are selling them off because repairs  
 are costly.   They are renovated by   
 private owners who are often retired  
 people.   The Council also wants new  
 houses built unused plot around the   
 village.  Both processes are happening
 all the time,  especially since about 
 1970.   The most recent little        
 development is Vieux Close, named     
 after Otterton's twinned village in   
 France.These are starter homes costing
 (Â£25.000) in 1985. Most people there, 
 like their move and have come from    
 local areas. We counted about 40      
 thatched houses in our block most of  
 them being in the main street. Most of
 these houses date back to later{Tudor 
 times one of them being dated 1627 on 
 the outside.
