		<title>01ALLET &amp;CALLESTICK AREA,TRURO</title>
		<content> This block, north-west of the city of 
 Truro, is mainly farmland, with the   
 hamlets of Allet &amp; Callestick each of 
 about 20 houses of different styles.  
 There is no housing development in the
 area &amp; no amenities apart from Allet  
 Chapel.The block is bisected by the   
 A30 trunkroad.The B3284 Perranporth-  
 Truro road crosses the southern part &amp;
 the A3075 the west of the block.There 
 are many single-track lanes &amp; farm    
 tracks, but very few footpaths. The   
 landscape of Cornish-hedged fields is 
 broken up by many small streams in    
 tree-lined valleys, some flowing north
 to the sea at Perranporth,others south
 to join the River Kenwyn.Several earth
 mounds indicate ancient settlement;the
 old mine engine-house near Callestick 
 is a sign of mining history; nearby is
 a small working sand &amp; gravel-pit.
