		<content>ON TUESDAY,25th JUNE WE INTERVIEWED A  
LADY AT RACHEL's FRUIT AND VEGETABLE   
SHOP.SHE BUYS HER FRUIT AND VEGETABLES 
FROM A FIRM IN NORTHAMPTON.THEY        
DELIVER FOUR TIMES A WEEK AT ABOUT     
8.30a.m.SHE GETS A LOT OF CUSTOMERS.THE
BUSIEST DAYS ARE TUESDAYS,THURSDAYS,   
FRIDAYS AND SATURDAY MORNINGS.HERE IS A
CHART FOR HER HOURS OF BUSINESS.       
MONDAY    9.00-12.45    CLOSED

SUMMER SHE SELLS A LOT OF SALAD THINGS.
