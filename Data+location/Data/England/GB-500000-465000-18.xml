		<title>18Our Survey of Langtoft</title>
		<content> The juniors from Langtoft School are  
 doing a survey of Langtoft.We have    
 been split into groups.Each group has 
 been given a list of houses to survey.
 On the questionnaire we were given    
 there were two parts.                 
 Part one was all about where the      
 people came from,what services they   
 used and how old their house was.     
 Part two  asked what changes people   
 had seen.                             
 Some people thought the sewers were   
 better and some people thought        
 electricity and pipe water was better.
{Lots of people thought bus service was
{worse.                                
 On the part where it asked you what   
 ought to be changed some people said  
 there should be a bus to Bridlington. 
 Someone said there should be sports   
 facilities.                           
                                       </content>
