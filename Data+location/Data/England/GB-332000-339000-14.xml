		<title>14Erbistock Village Hall</title>
		<content> The village of Erbistock has a village
 hall.The local church bought the      
 building in 1974.There was no real    
 centre to the community and so when   
 the local village primary school      
 closed down, because only 11 children 
 were in attendance,  the village      
 people bought the school. They did not
 want it to be sold as a private       
 residence and felt that the village   
 needed a community centre.            
  The hall is used for church functions
 and meetings by the local Women's     
 Institute.The Brownies and Young      
 Farmers organisations use the hall for
 various events. It is also used for   
 Parish Council meetings.
