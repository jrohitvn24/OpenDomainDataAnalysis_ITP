		<title>11A TYPICAL DAY FOR ALISTAIR</title>
		<content> I wake at 7.30 in the morning &amp; put my
 radio on,then doze for half an hour   
 before the racket from the cockerel   
 over the road eventually gets me out  
 of bed.I dress ready for school in    
 black trousers,blue shirt, grey socks 
 and a grey jumper. After washing my   
 hands &amp; face I go downstairs for      
 breakfast which is usually bacon, egg,
 sausages &amp; bread followed by a cup of 
 tea or coffee.Each morning at school  
 we have an assembly followed by Maths 
 and English. During the mid morning   
 playtime I usually play football. At  
 twelve o'clock we have school dinner  
 which is usually delicious.Lessons in 
 the afternoon include Art &amp; craft,    
 games, poetry, topic work &amp; reading.  
 When I return home I practice on my   
 clarinet or go out to play before we  
 have tea.We then watch television.
