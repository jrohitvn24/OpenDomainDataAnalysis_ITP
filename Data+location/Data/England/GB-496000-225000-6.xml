		<title>06ST NICHOLAS CHURCH,HOCKLIFFE</title>
		<content> The small church commands{a dominant  
{position on a steep sided spur.} It is
 made from local materials such as     
 Totternhoe stone and ironstone.{ St.  
{Nicholas's Hockliffe}was built in the 
{14th century,}although it's first     
{vicar}is recorded in 1217.  Additions 
 were made in the{15th century         
{including the tower. }In {1910}the    
 tower was repaired by public          
 subscription. There is a small aisle  
 on the left, in which the{Lord        
{of the Manor}would sit with his wife  
 and children. They even had the       
 privilege of a private entrance. Of   
 interest is the Gilpin vault.{1985}the
 church has{regular services,}although 
 the congregation only numbers about   
 twelve. Unfortunately the church no   
 longer has its own vicar.  Instead    
 a{curate}from{Leighton Buzzard's      
{church}takes the services.            </content>
