		<content>Wednesfield Health Centre is in Alfred 
Squire Road.It's quite a big place.    
Inside there is a dental clinic,an eye 
clinic,a hearing clinic,a child        
health clinic,an antenatal clinic and  
a place where ladies go to practice    
having babies called childbirth        
training classes.There are 4 full time 
doctors,each with a nurse.There is     
also a team of district nurses working 
in the practice and in the patients'   
home as well.The clinic also has a     
Health Visitor working in preventative 
medicine and health care.Her main jobs 
are to involve families in nutrition   
programmes,and make sure all the       
health care services are known about   
and used.Nurses from the clinic come   
into school and check all the children,
keeping an eye on children who are not 
as healthy as they should be.
