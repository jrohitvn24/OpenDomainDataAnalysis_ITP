		<title>11HYDROPATHY</title>
		<content> Matlock has many large{Victorian      
{buildings}on the hillside.These were{ 
{hydropathic establishments}.People    
 with illnesses came to stay at the    
 hydros where they had different kinds 
 of baths in the hope that these would 
 cure them.                            
 After the first and second World Wars 
 the hydros went out of fashion, and,  
 today, the large buildings are used   
 for other purposes.The College of     
 Higher Education uses several as halls
 of residence and lecture rooms.Others 
 have become schools and hotels and the
 most famous, Smedley's Hydro, has     
 become the County Offices.
