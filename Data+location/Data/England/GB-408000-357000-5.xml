		<title>05An Ecton Schoolgirl's day</title>
		<content>     I usually get up around 8 o'clock 
and, at 8.45a.m. I get a lift to       
school with a helpful neighbour.       
     After one and a half hours of     
lessons it is time for Break.  I sit   
and talk to friends or visit the tuck  
shop for a bag of crisps.              
     After more lessons it is time for 
dinner, when we can play badminton or  
tennis, or we can just talk.           
     When the bell rings at home-time, 
we line up in the hall and when our bus
arrives we get on, and, with a great   
deal of chattering the journey begins. 
     When I get off the bus, I have a  
half-hour walk down a lane - lovely in 
the sun, but in the rain or snow.......
     When I get home I do my homework, 
read a new library book, go to the     
Youth  Club at Warslow if it is        
Monday, or just talk with my family.
