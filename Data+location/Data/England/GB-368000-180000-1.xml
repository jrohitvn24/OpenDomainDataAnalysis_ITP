		<content> Yate is designated as a New Town,     
 until the 1960's the land was used for
 agriculture purposes. Two major       
 industries were situated alongside the
 main road. Parnalls which is now      
 Jacksons and Newman Industries.       
 Newmans factory is in the process of  
 being demolished so that the site may 
 be redeveloped. The industrial        
 develpoment in Yate has increased with
 the provision of an Industrial Estate,
 mainly for light industry.            
   Housing continues to grow with local
 opposition because facilities are not 
 able to cope wtih the growing demands 
 eg The Health Centre. Yate New Town is
 the largest housing development in    
 Europe.
