		<content> On a Sunday morning I usually get up  
 about 8.00. For breakfast I have a    
 piece of toast. Then I feed the hens, 
 and see if the Banty has laid any     
 eggs, and feed the cats for Mum. When 
 Dad gets up we go for a walk down by  
 the river to check up on the          
 ducklings.                            
 After we have had dinner me and my    
 sister go out side to play tennis     
 in the barn. Some times when Mum and  
 Dad have washed up we go over to      
 Grandma's to get some eggs.           
 When we get home we have tea and watch
 telly for a while until the water is  
 hot for Mum to wash up. When they are 
 in the middle of washing up I usually 
 make some short bread and spicey      
 flapjacks for the next day. Then me   
 and my sister have a bath and have    
 some supper and go to bed.
