		<title>13Ledburn Farm</title>
		<content>{Ledburn Farm, }in the village of the  
 same name, consists of 470 acres of   
 largely arable land, mostly put down  
 to{oilseed rape, barley}and{wheat, }  
 but with 20 acres of{sugar beet}grown 
 for seed, and 10 acres of{evening     
{primrose,}a fairly new venture for the
 farmer. This crop is worth about Â£2000
 a ton and the chemical industry is    
 keen to buy it, but it must be cleaned
 to 97% purity after harvesting, which 
 is not easy or cheap to achieve.      
 Ledburn Farm also has 3,000{turkeys}  
 which will be sold locally, fresh for 
 Christmas, and 50{bullocks}which  are 
 sold to a butcher in Berkhamsted.     
 The bullocks and turkeys are farmed   
 intensively using cereals, but the    
 cattle side of the business is        
 gradually being reduced as it is      
 difficult to produce the quality of   
 beef required.                        </content>
