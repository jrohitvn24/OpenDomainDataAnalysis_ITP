		<title>13SESSAY SOCIAL CLUB</title>
		<content>{Sessay Village Hall}was built in 1971 
 with money raised by the villagers.   
 The{Social Club}was added 4 years     
 later.  This has a licensed bar which 
 is open every evening, staffed by     
 volunteers.  As well as the outdoor   
 sports available one can take part in 
 something different every evening -   
 play Bridge, learn upholstery or try  
 indoor bowling.  The{Senior Citizens  
 and{Women's Institute}meet monthly.   
{Playschool}is very well attended twice
 a week by under-5s.  The enthusiastic 
{ladies darts team}plays each Wednesday
 with considerable success.  Thursdays 
 from September to April see the{Drama 
{Group}rehearsing a Christmas Show or a
 Spring Concert. Sessay's Village Hall 
 and its full calendar of events are   
 the envy of many surrounding villages,
 and one would find it difficult to    
 live here without becoming involved.  </content>
