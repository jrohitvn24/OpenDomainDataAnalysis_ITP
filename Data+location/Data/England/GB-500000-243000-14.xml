		<content> The churches in our area are all in   
 Wootton. Besides the parish church of{
 St. Mary's  in Church Road{(Church of 
{England)}there is also a{Methodist    
 Chapel in Cause End Road, and a{      
{Baptist}Chapel next to the Lower      
 School in Bedford Road. There are also
 services held for{Roman Catholics}in  
 the Memorial Hall in Bedford Road.    
 The first Baptist Chapel in Wootton   
 was started at Yew Tree Cottage in    
 Cause End Road and the baptistery     
 still exists under the floorboards of 
 the hallway. The present chapel,      
 although dated 1836 was remodelled    
 later. The Methodist Chapel also dates
 from the late 19th century.           
 All the churches play an important    
 part in village life. Many village    
 clubs and organisations are connected 
 with one or the other of the churches.
