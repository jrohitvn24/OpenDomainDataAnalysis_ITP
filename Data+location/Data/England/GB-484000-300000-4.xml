 The footpath to Ayston from the       
 Leicester Rd Uppingham is a distinct  
 footpath,which produces quite a       
 contrast to the Castle Hill path.The  
 footpath is clearly signposted from   
 either side and follows a well        
 marked path most of its course.It     
 passes through two unused rough       
 pasture fields,but the path can easily
 be followed and is not hidden by      
 vegetation because of extensive       
 use.The track passes through          
 local allotments as well as other     
 pasture land,which is used mainly for 
 cattle.Since the by-pass was built the
 path crosses it (the only manmade     
 hinderence) but stiles have been      
 erected to facilitate access to the   
 path.
