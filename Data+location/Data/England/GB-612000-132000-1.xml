		<title>01Our D-block</title>
		<content>   Our twelve kilometre D-block is a   
 mixture of land and sea being found on
 the South-east coast of England. Our  
 school,{Palmarsh CP School,}is more or
 less in the centre of our D-block with
 the North Downs as a back-cloth to us 
 to the north and the{English Channel  
 to the South. Between the Channel and 
 us is the{Hythe Ranges}within which   
 are two{Martello Towers}and a Ridout. 
 To the West of us, is the{gravel      
{quarry}while to the East the historic 
{Cinque Port of Hythe}is found.        
                                       
   During the day, especially through  
 the summer, school life is enlivened  
 by the hooting of one of the twelve   
 railway engines that run along the    
 famous{Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch    
{Railway}which passes a stone's throw  
 along the rear of the school alongside
 the{Royal Military Canal.}            </content>
