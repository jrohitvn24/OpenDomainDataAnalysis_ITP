		<title>07Ruan Major Church</title>
		<content> We went to see Ruan Major Church.The  
 church is very isolated.There are only
 two old cottages near it.This used to 
 be the main church but now Ruan Minor 
 has taken its place.It is mostly in   
 ruins now.The walls and tower are     
 still there but the roof has been     
 taken down because it was             
 dangerous.Most of the windows are     
 smashed except the front one.There is 
 netting to protect it.When the church 
 was left after the Second World War   
 everything was still in it even hymn  
 books.Gradually it began to rot.There 
 are still the remains of the old tiled
 floor.The font was taken to Ruan Minor
 and the bell to the Lizard.We read in 
 an old book that in 1868 a            
 thunderstorm damaged a pinnacle on the
 tower and it had to be pushed         
 down.This left three pinnacles but now
 there are four.                       </content>
