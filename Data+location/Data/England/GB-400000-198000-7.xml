		<content> Various social events take place      
 during the year at Chesterton Primary 
 School when parents and friends are   
 invited.In the Autumn Term children   
 bring garden produce to Harvest       
 Festival.These goods together with a  
 sheaf of corn loaf made in the school 
 are sold for charity funds.Book Week  
 brings authors,publishers and book    
 sellers to a Book Fair at its end,the 
 profits from this going to the school 
 Library fund.Later,at term end,       
 Christmas time means Infant-made cake 
 &amp; tea for Mums &amp; Dads of the younger  
 children.The Nativity Play is always a
 big draw at this time.Spring term is a
 quiet time socially but in the Summer 
 term the Fete &amp; Sports days bring many
 to the School.The year ends with a big
 Concert as orchestra,choir,guitar,    
 dance and gym clubs perform together
