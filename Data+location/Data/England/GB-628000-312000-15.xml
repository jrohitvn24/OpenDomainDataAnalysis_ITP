		<title>15Norfolk Reed Thatching</title>
		<content> The{Norfolk Broads}are man-made, the  
 result of{peat digging}at the edges of
 the main rivers. All around these     
 Broads grow the{Norfolk reeds,}the raw
 material of the{Thatcher.}Nowadays,   
 Thatching is big business with reeds  
 even being shipped to America.        
{Norfolk reed thatch}is considered to  
 be the finest of all, lasting for     
 50-60 years.The reed is made into     
 bundles and secured to the roof with  
 hazel sticks or 'sways' and iron      
 hooks.On the ridge of the roof a      
 double layer of thatch is used for    
 strength.Thatch is warmer in winter   
 and cooler in summer than most common 
 types of roofing.Each thatcher 'signs'
 his work with his own particular      
 unique pattern.
