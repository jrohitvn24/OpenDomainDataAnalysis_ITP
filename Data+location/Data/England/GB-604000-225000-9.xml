		<content>    The hobby of {Combined carriage    
{driving}using{Shetland ponies}is very 
 demanding on time and money. Teams are
 driven in pairs,in tandem or singly   
 pulling two or four wheel carriages of
 the appropriate weight and with a     
 driver and groom. Trials are held at  
 places like{Badminton, Windsor and    
{Brighton}often against much larger    
 animals and entrance costs can be     
 prohibitive.                          
    Carriages can be very expensive and
 although the ponies themselves may not
 cost much initially, they have to     
 be fed all year. Training to harness, 
 to be handled without making a        
 fuss, stabling, shoeing and travelling
 in a horse box are all aspects of this
 hobby.
