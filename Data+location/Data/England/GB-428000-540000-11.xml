		<title>11DURHAM RACECOURSE</title>
		<content>   The racecourse was once used for    
 horse racing, but now it is used for  
 all kinds of sports. There is a       
 cricket club and pitch used by Durham 
 City Cricket Club, croquet lawn, a    
 putting green, a climbing frame, a    
 toilet for ladies and gents.          
   The Rugby Club is next to the       
 Cricket Club, and next to that is an  
 allotment. The cricket ground and a   
 field next to it is used by the N.U.M.
 every year for the Miners Gala. There 
 are speeches and a march.             
   Along the racecourse we counted only
 two litter bins. The boathouse is     
 called St. Cuthberts Boathouse, and   
 there is a shelter just along the     
 path.
