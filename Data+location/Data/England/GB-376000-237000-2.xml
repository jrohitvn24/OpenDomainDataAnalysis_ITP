		<title>02Malvern Hills &amp; Commons</title>
		<content> The whole of this area was once part  
 of the Royal Forest of Malvern        
 Chase.  This was sold to raise money  
 for the monarchy in the 17th century, 
 and large areas were left as common   
 land. Public concern over the         
 enclosing of the commons brought about
 the{Malvern Hills Act 1884.}The Act   
 set up a{Board of Conservators,}unpaid
 and elected, to safeguard the rights  
 of the commoners and to give the      
 public right of access for recreation.
 An income is given from the rates. In 
 order to stop the{quarrying}on the    
 Hills the Conservators were given some
 limited powers of compulsory purchase 
 in 1924 and quarrying finally ended in
 1977.  The last quarry to be worked   
 was the Gullet at Midsummmer Hill.    
 The National Trust own Midsummer Hill 
 and Broad Down.
