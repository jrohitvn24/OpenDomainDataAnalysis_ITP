CHARGE.                                
Charge is a game that you need quite a 
lot of people for .Choose one person to
go in the middle of the area you are   
playing in.You need quite a lot of     
space.Say the person you have chosen is
called Sarah,Sarah has to call out     
someones name or say "Charge" .If Sarah
says charge then everyone has to try   
and run across without being caught. If
someone gets caught,they have to help  
Sarah to catch the other people .When  
everyone is caught ,the game ends. The 
first person who was caught in the     
previous game is it for the next game. 
If the person who was chosen to run    
across from one side to the other makes
it,all the other people have to run    
across without being caught.           
     It is a great game to play at     
playtimes.                             </content>
