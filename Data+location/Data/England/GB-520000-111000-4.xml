		<content> The main land cover consists of       
 Downland , weald and low lying meadow.
 As the South Downs run through this   
 area there are many footpaths         
 including the famous South Downs Way. 
 At Tottington Barn there is a Youth   
 Hostel used by walkers. Close by at   
 Truleigh Hill there is an aircraft    
 navigation aid and telephone microwave
 tower. As a contrast further along    
 there is a Tumulus and a Mottle and   
 Bailey. As well as the South Downs Way
 there is also a bridleway. Pond       
 restoration is taking place, 2 have   
 been reclaimed, tree planting and     
 fencing under the auspices of the     
 conservationists . Most of the chalk  
 and gravel pits are now disused and   
 are used as infills for rubbish. Many 
 wild species of flowers thrive on the 
 chalky soil of the South Downs.
