		<content>     How the Reserve was Founded.      
    {____________________________      
     During the{20th century}lakes     
 formed on the marsh due to mine       
 subsidence. When the mine closed down 
 there was further subsidence and more 
 of the marsh became flooded. The reeds
 from the river started to spread very 
 rapidly. Then birds started to nest   
 there. The{Nature Conservancy Council 
 realised how important this reed bed  
 was, close to the continent and the   
 sea, so made it into a{reserve.       
     The{nature reserve}is about four  
 hundred acres (one hundred and sixty  
 two hectares), the largest reed bed in
 Kent and one of the few left in the   
 country. The lakes are about one metre
 deep but there are many deep pits.    
     This marsh was once completely    
 covered by the sea, separating the{   
{Isle of Thanet}from the mainland.     </content>
