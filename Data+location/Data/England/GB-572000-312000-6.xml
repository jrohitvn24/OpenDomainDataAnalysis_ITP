		<title>06HOME LIFE Pentney &amp; Narboro'</title>
		<content>{Food:}Narborough has some food shops  
 but Pentney has none and therefore    
 most families in the area shop either 
 in King's  Lynn or Swaffham and       
 supplement their purchases with home  
 grown fruit and vegetables. Fresh food
 tradesmen call at the villages each   
 week and milk is delivered daily.     
                                       
{Quality of Life:}Most households are  
 equipped with modern appliances and   
 heated adequately. Many families keep 
 pets, some more exotic than others.   
 Several clubs and organisations exist 
 for the whole family to enjoy. There  
 is a cinema in King's Lynn. A mobile  
 library calls monthly. Many develop   
 their own hobbies and outdoor pursuits
 like fishing, shooting, and riding. A 
 local hunt often starts from Pentney. 
 Dangers exist in a rural environment  
 and care needs to be taken.           </content>
