		<content> Entertainment tends to be home based. 
 This is partly because the buses and  
 coaches do not run in the evening.    
 Watching television and video films   
 and listening to the radio are very   
 popular.Video films can be recorded   
 using special equipment and a         
 television,or they can be hired from  
 shops in the local towns or from      
 mobile video libraries.Occasionally   
 people travel to Kings Lynn to visit  
 the theatre or the cinema.However this
 tends to be quite expensive - it would
 cost a family of two adults and two   
 children in the region of Â£12-Â£13 for 
 transport and entrance.               
 Villagers make use of the local clubs 
 in the evenings including the social  
 club which has a licensed bar.        
 Unfortunately the village no longer   
 has a public house, although there    
 used to be five.                      </content>
