		<content>      The first church of St.Peter was 
 built in AD 1000 but the earliest part
 now standing dates from 1220. It has  
 been extended over the centuries and  
 plans are now being made to extend    
 further to provide extra Sunday School
 accomodation. It is mainly built of   
 soft stone. There are stained glass   
 windows, a peel of six bells a large  
 pipe organ, some fine brasses and a   
 choir of twelve.                      
      Three Sunday  Services  are  held
 together with a weekly communion. At a
 family service all the 160 seats are  
 full with a congregation ranging      
 in age from 6 weeks to 88 years.      
      The churchyard contains iron     
 memorials made at Heybridge.          
      The church is situated  away from
 the village centre which has developed
 around the Colchester/Maldon Road.
