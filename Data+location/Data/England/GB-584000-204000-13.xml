		<title>13NORTHEY ISLAND</title>
		<content>   Northey Island is East of Maldon,   
 down the river towards where the river
 meets the sea.It used to be private   
 land used for farming but a few years 
 ago it was bought by the Essex Natura-
 lists Trust and in 1984 was bought by 
 the National Trust.There is still a   
 farm on the island but much of the    
 land is marsh.The only way to get to  
 Northey Island is across the narrow   
 causeway,which is only possible when  
 the tide is out.It is a good place for
 wild flowers and birds.There are some 
 special hides which have been built so
 that you can watch the birds without  
 disturbing them.You have to get a spe-
 cial permit before you can go on the  
 island.The most famous birds that vis-
 it Northey Island are the Brent Geese 
 which fly over from Siberia and spend 
 the Winter here every year.
