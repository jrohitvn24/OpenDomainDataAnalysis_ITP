		<title>01SHAW</title>
		<content> Shaw is a small town situated north of
 Oldham and east of the Pennines.It was
 formerly heavily dependent on the     
 cotton industry but now most people   
 work in other jobs outside Shaw.It is 
 now becoming much more 0f a           
 residential suburb on the fringes of  
 the Greater Manchester connurbation as
 can be seen from the patterns of      
 population movement.In response to the
 growth of population new housing and  
 schools have been built.This is       
 naturally leading to a reduction of   
 the farm land available.However,Shaw  
 still retains much of its community   
 identity,centred round the open market
 held every Thursday.
