		<title>17Recreation in Knockholt</title>
		<content> This area is used for recreation by   
 many people besides the residents. The
 footpaths are used regularly by       
 families and walking clubs from London
 who often lunch in the pub gardens.   
 People come here for country drives,  
 cycle rides and on horses, and in     
 Winter to ski and sledge. Several     
 fields are used for keeping horses and
 there are private paddocks, tennis    
 courts and swimming pools. Pheasant   
 shoots take place on the Chevening    
 Estate and there are occasional clay  
 pigeon shoots. Gardening is one of the
 chief leisure activies of the locals  
 who also join in the life of adjacent 
 villages; Old Peoples Clubs, Brownies,
 W.I., clubs for art, flower arranging,
 horticulture and drama; sports like   
 football and cricket and social clubs.
 Dog walkers, joggers and pony traps   
 are often seen.                       </content>
