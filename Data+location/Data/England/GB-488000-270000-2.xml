across the nave to stop the walls      
falling in,it is very decorative.

which, now houses theological books.   
  The organ was built by Christopher   
Schrieder in 1717.It came from a       
church in London and is supposed to    
have been played on by Handel.The      
font, pictured in one of the windows

much older church and was found in a   
field being used as a cattle trough.
