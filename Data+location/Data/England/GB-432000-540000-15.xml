		<title>15WHAT WE THINK ABOUT LUDWORTH</title>
		<content>      Emma and I went round the doors  
 to ask People if they liked Living in 
 Ludworth and most people we asked     
 said,"Yes we do like living in        
 Ludworth." We asked questions about   
 these things:-                        
      1.Housing                        
      2.Shops                          
      3.Bus services                   
      4.Medical services               
      5.Libraries                      
      6.Community facilities           
                                       
      Almost everyone we asked was     
 satisfied with the standard of things 
 on the list, but some people were not 
 pleased with the distance the had to  
 travel to the doctor's, dentist, or   
 library.                              
      We did the survey at night,      
 because more people were at home.
