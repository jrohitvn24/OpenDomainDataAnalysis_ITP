		<title>06A day in the life of Ian</title>
		<content> I am nine years of age and this is a  
 day in my life.  It is Friday morning 
 and I wake up at 7.00 a.m. and read   
 until 7.45 a.m. Then I get dressed,   
 wash my face and clean my teeth.  My  
 Mum makes my sandwiches and puts them 
 in my bag.  I go to school at 8.40    
 a.m. and the bell goes at 8.55 a.m.   
 We work until 10.30 a.m., go out to   
 play and come in again at 10.45 a.m.  
 At 12.00 I go to eat my sandwiches and
 break ends at 1.15 p.m.  We go home at
 3.15 p.m.  At 4.00 p.m. I go to gym   
 club.  When I come home I have a cup  
 of tea, then I go to judo.  It starts 
 at seven o'clock and finishes at      
 eight.  I get home at half past eight.
 I have something to eat and I go to   
 bed at about 10 o'clock.              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
