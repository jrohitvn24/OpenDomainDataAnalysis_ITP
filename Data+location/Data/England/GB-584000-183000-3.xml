		<content> When I get up in the morning I have a 
 breakfast of cornflakes and tea, walk 
 to school on my own arriving at about 
 8.30. I stand around chatting to my   
 friends till 8.55 till the bell goes. 
  On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays we
 have a fifteen minute Assembly.In the 
 morning we have Maths, English        
 Workshop and Crosswords. This lasts   
 until the 10.45 playtime which ends at
 11 o'clock.We carry on with our work  
 and have half an hour's reading until 
 12 o'clock.                           
     After dinner we might do Topic    
 Work, Music, P.E., Swimming, or Art   
 and Craft according to the day.Often  
 we have a story read just before we go
 home at 3 p.m.Sometimes we have after-
 school clubs like Netball, Badminton, 
 Football, Cycling or Swimming.
