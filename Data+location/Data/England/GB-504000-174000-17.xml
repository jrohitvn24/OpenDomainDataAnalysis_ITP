 Mr Underwood is a postman. He gets up 
 at 4 o'clock in the morning to go to  
 work. First he collects his letters   
 and then does his round. He finishes  
 at 12.30.                             
 The Sorting Office is where the       
 postmen sort the letters into         
 trolleys, for different places.       
 The postman has to sort his own       
 letters out into streets and houses.

{Mike the Milkman}                     
 Mike gets up at 4 am. He pulls the    
 plug out of the milk float because it 
 is electric and is left on at night to
 charge. He loads all the crates and   
 then delivers the milk to all his     
 customers. He helps his customers     
 sometimes, like putting up curtains   
 and mending things for them.          </content>
