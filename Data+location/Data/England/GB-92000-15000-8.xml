		<title>08ROWING ON ST.MARTINS I.O.S</title>
		<content>   On the island not very much sport is
 played because of the small           
 population.But every Friday between   
 May and October there is a gig race   
 for the men, and every other Wednesday
 the ladies have a gig race too.A gig  
 race is when long thin boats called   
 gigs are rowed by six men or women    
 over varied courses.After the race the
 crews and coxwains go to the pub to   
 celebrate or relax together.There is  
 keen competition, and the crews race  
 for trophies which are presented at a 
 dinner at the end of the season.The   
 Dolphin is the St.Martins gig,it was  
 launched in 1969 and was built        
 locally.It's dimensions and lines are 
 based on those of the original pilot  
 gigs.It is painted silver.Also gig    
 racing is a source of entertainment   
 because the pleasure boats do trips   
 for supporters to watch the races.    </content>
