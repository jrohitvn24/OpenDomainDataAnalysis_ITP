		<content> At six o'clock on Sunday morning      
 everybody was up and dressed. The sun 
 shone brightly and everywhere was     
 blanketed in snow _ about seven inches
 of it!                                
 The priority was to light a fire. As  
 all Scouts know the fire is your      
 friend; apart from cooking and warming
 by it, it is a great moral booster in 
 adverse conditions. They coped very   
 well and should never normally        
 experience such trying conditions     
 again, and anyway, everyone went home 
 left with their own stories to tell.  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
