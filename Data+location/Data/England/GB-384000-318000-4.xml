		<title>04Inside Bradley Church</title>
		<content>Inside the church,in the tower,there   
is a Norman font,which is 900years old 
and made at the time of the first      
Domesday Project.It has been carved    
into a cylinder shape out of a big     
stone and looks like a big drum.There  
are lovely patterns on it,these are    
called cable,billet,fret,greek key and 
star.A round,but not very deep         
hole,has been carved in the top and in 
it there is a little dish with water   
in it.The vicar blesses the water and  
uses it for christenings.It has got a  
large wooden lid with handles.In front 
of the altar there is a  rood screen.  
It is 60 years old and made of wood    
and was carved with beautiful lacey    
patterns by a  man called Nathaniel    
Hitch.You can walk on the top of it    
where there is a carving of Jesus on   
the cross.The screen has 9 arches.
