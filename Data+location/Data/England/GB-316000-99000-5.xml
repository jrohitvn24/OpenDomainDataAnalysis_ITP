		<title>05The Market in Honiton</title>
		<content>  The market has been held in Honiton  
 for many centuries and until recent   
 years it was held in the High Street. 
  Now the cattle market is held every  
 Tuesday on a permanent site by the    
 Community College.  Cows, sheep,      
 poultry and pigs are bought and sold  
 by farmers from Devon and Somerset.   
 Husseys the auctioneers are a local   
 firm.                                 
  The street market is still held along
 the High Street on Tuesdays and       
 Saturdays selling meat, fish,         
 vegetables, flowers, antiques and     
 fabrics.                              
  This year a new covered market was   
 opened alongside the New Dolphin      
 Hotel. Fish, meat, fruit, vegetables, 
 antiques and tablelinen are sold      
 daily. There is also a small cafe.
