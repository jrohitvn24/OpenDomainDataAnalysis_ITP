		<title>07 MIDDLE AND UPPER MARKETS</title>
		<content> The Middle market is the selling area 
 for{fat stock cattle}bred for beef.   
 There are Charolais,Devon,Jersey,     
 Friesian and Hereford cows.It is not  
 the same{auctioneer}who sells every   
 week.The cattle arrive in{lorries     
 they are unloaded,weighed,auctioned,  
 penned and loaded by drovers on to the
 buyers' lorries.In the upper market   
 calves and pigs are sold.The month old
{calves}are sold for about Â£150 and    
 fetch a good price because in the     
 summer there is plenty of milk to feed
 them.{Pigs,}about eight weeks old,    
 are mainly White Saddle Backs and     
 are sold for fattening.In June the    
 market is not very busy because       
 farmers are busy with silage and      
 hay_making.50 years ago the animals   
 were driven to market and  made the   
 streets very messy.Now after every    
 market it is hosed down.              </content>
