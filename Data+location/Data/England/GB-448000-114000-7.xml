		<title>07THE MOTORWAY:-M27</title>
		<content> This motorway was opened in           
 1984.Before it was built a selection  
 of copses and plantations occupied the
 area, such as Rounds Copse,Long Copse,
 Westwood Copse and Kilndose           
 plantation.There were also separate   
 fields in which things like           
 raspberries,potatoes and other kinds  
 of vegetables were grown.             
 A sign shows us that McAlpines built  
 the motorway.It is a very busy road   
 and has three lanes in each           
 direction.In a period of 15 minutes we
 counted 250 vehicles going to         
 Portsmouth and 599 coming from        
 Portsmouth.These included 176 cars    
 going to Portsmouth and 250 coming    
 from Portsmouth.Altogether there were 
 166 lorries,52 vans,7 motorbikes,6    
 caravans,6 coaches,1 road             
 cleaner,which we were very suprised to
 see,and 1 school bus.                 </content>
