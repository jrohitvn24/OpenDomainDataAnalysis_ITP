		<title>02PERCEPTIONS OF THE CHURCH</title>
		<content> Mr. Davis, a Cornishman, was very     
 aware of the differences of his work  
 as a Vicar in Nottingham compared to {
{Lostwithiel.}He found that the Cornish
 hated change. The pace in Cornwall, he
 found much slower. Mr. Davis started a
{Fellowship}Group, which had no more   
 than five members; now there are      
 forty. People are being drawn to the  
 church by this and along with this    
 increase in numbers has been the      
 variation in ages,  young and old     
 alike. By holding the traditional {   
{Prayer Book}service and the new modern
 service, he has been able to cater for
 everyone.                             
 The Vicar believes more and more are  
 turning to the church, a lot of them  
 young people. He finds it difficult to
 exercise his ministry to youth because
 of diocesan restrictions and he may   
 move.                                 </content>
