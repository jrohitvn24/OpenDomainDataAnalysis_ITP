		<content>The A12 trunk road from Great Yarmouth 
to London passes through this area. It 
carries a wide variety of {traffic}    
including goods vehicles of all kinds, 
service buses, coaches, private cars   
and bicycles. Early in 1985 the        
Ministry of Transport proposed the     
degrading of this road to that of a 'B'
category but this suggestion met with  
such strong opposition that, for the   
time being, the proposal has been      
dropped. The road enables vehicles     
using the nearby industrial estate to  
{transport} goods easily and vehicles  
from the port of Lowestoft use this    
road to take goods to London. Public   
transport in the area is provided by   
buses of the Eastern Counties Omnibus  
Company enabling residents of Pakefield
to {travel} to Lowestoft, Oulton Broad,
Carlton Colville and Kessingland. The  
services are regular but infrequent.   </content>
