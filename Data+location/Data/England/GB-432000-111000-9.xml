		<title>09GIDDINGS TIMBER YARD</title>
		<content> The Timber Yard was established in    
 1928. They now have 110 men employed. 
 They work from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m.,   
 five days a week. They sell pallets,  
 packing cases, fencing panels, sawn   
 fencing materials and golden larch.   
 Between 100 - 120 tonnes of wood      
 arrives at the yard every day. Timber 
 is imported ready sawn from Sweden and
 Portugal. 40% of the timber used is   
 home grown. There is a 45% wastage    
 rate and leftovers include 20 tonnes  
 of sawdust, 10 tonnes of bark and 20  
 tonnes of off-cuts - all per day. Some
 of the sawdust is sold to farms for   
 the bottom of animal pens. Giddings   
 hire two articulated lorries to carry 
 the timber. They mainly use softwood  
 coniferous trees like spruce.         
 The yard covers 11 acres.
