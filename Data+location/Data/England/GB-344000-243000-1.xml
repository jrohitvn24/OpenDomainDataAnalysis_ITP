		<content>  Our "D block" is a largely rural and 
 agricultural area to the North West of
 Hereford. The principal settlements   
 are Credenhill,Burghill, Tillington   
 and Brinsop. Credenhill the largest   
 settlement its population increased by
 the presence of a large R.A.F. camp   
 situated close to the village. The    
 highest point is Credenhill Park Wood 
 which is 219m. above sea level and    
 surmounted by a large Iron Age        
 Camp.Other antiquities of interest in 
 the area include the Roman road which 
 crosses the block diagonally from     
 South West to North East and the      
 three parish churches of              
 Credenhill,Brinsop and Burghill. Each 
 contains items of noteworthy historic 
 interest. Perhaps the most important  
 domestic building is Brinsop Court a  
 timbered and moated manor house with  
 strong Wordsworth associations.       </content>
