		<content>   Crop spraying is also hazardous to  
 beekeepers. Unless the warning is     
 given to the beekeeper the evening    
 before, so that the bees can be shut  
 in their hives, there is a good chance
 that they will all be killed if the   
 bees are sprayed in the fields in     
 which they are working.               
                                       
   Pheasant rearing on the Prestwold   
 Estate for its annual shoot has       
 increased the local game bird         
 population with escapees;unfortunately
 these birds are very tame, and not    
 noted for their high intelligence and 
 often end up as road casualties.      
                                       
   There is also a colony of feral cats
 around the Hawker Siddely Buildings.
