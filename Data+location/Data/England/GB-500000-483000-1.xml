		<content> The village of Seamer is situated some
 7kms SW of Scarborough at the eastern 
 end of the Vale of Pickering where the
 flat vale meets the gently sloping dip
 slope of Irton Moor.Seamer is an old  
 settlement dating back to Pre-Roman   
 times,for weapons of the Parisii have 
 been excavated from local gravel pits.
 The church is the oldest building and 
 parts of the chancel and nave have    
 Norman characteristics.During the     
 Middle Ages,Seamer was more important 
 than Scarborough,so the Burghers of   
 Scarborough suppressed the markets.To-
 day Seamer with it's neighbouring     
 village of Irton,is still rural.It    
 lies in a rich farming area,but has   
 now attracted modern housing estates, 
 with an urban expansion of council    
 houses at Eastfield and private devel-
 opments at Crossgates and Seamer.The  
 area lies on the main A64 York road.  </content>
