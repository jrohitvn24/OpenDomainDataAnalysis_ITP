		<title>13ARTS AND CRAFTS IN EDGEFIELD</title>
		<content> The Edgefield gallery is near the     
 village green and is run by Trevor    
 Taylor, a painter from Nottinghamshire
 who typically paints buildings and    
 farm animals against dramatic stormy  
 skies.                                
 Other artists living in the village   
 include Mary Millar Watt, who         
 specialises in watercolour flower     
 paintings, and Sarah Merlen who paints
 birds.                                
 The Edgefield pottery is in a 16th    
 century building on the edge of the   
 village on the Norwich-Holt road: its 
 welcoming sign offering tea and coffee
 and its large car park entice holiday 
 makers in to see the workshop in      
 action and to eat and drink surrounded
 by an attractive range of mugs,       
 bowls,pots &amp; vases. This is a family  
 concern exuding an air of busy        
 contentment.                          </content>
