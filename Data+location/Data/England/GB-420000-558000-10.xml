		<content> What is the most fashionable colour to
 paint the outside of your house in    
 l985? Yes you're white!               
  We looked at almost 4000 houses for  
 signs of other colours - but in our   
 block we found that with almost one in
 every two houses coated in the stuff  
 it was a white wash.                  
 So where did that leave other colours?
 Brown used on l7% of houses was the   
 runner up, mainly because we included 
 fashionable new wood stains in with   
 this colour. Blue l5% and Green ll%   
 were the only other runners in the    
 race. What ws the least popular       
 colour? At under l% black seems to    
 have almost dyed a death!             
  Lobley Hill wins our 'Most Colourful 
 Community Award' - white was the main 
 colour on less than l5% of houses -   
 but in Sunniside (2l60) an anaemic 68%
 of homes used a paler shade of white. </content>
