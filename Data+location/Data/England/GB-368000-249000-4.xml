		<title>04Causes for concern</title>
		<content> This is a very caring community and   
 people are concerned about many       
 conditions in the countryside: pol-   
 lution of streams by sprays,          
 fertilisers, silage effluent,         
 inefficient sewage and rubbish dump-  
 ing; loss of woodlands, hedges, wild  
 flowers, butterflies, some birds. and 
 footpaths. Families with teenagers are
 worried about unemployment, drugs,    
 distasteful and horrific              
 television,and lack of discipline at  
 school and at home.  Farmers  are     
 concerned about thieving of stock and 
 implements, EEC imports and           
 regulations, butter and corn mountains
 and the future of farming, also the   
 urban spread into the countryside.    
 Looking further afield we worry about 
 the nuclear bomb,and starving         
 Africans. Low flying aircraft, heavy  
 vehicles and poor roads worry us also.</content>
