  What people in the area wear is      
usually determined by the job of work  
they do.                               
  Trousers and shirts are worn by both 
sexes of the young and middle-aged.    
Older women tend to wear easily washed 
dresses or skirts and blouses.         
  Hats are seldom worn, even to church,
and footwear is strong and practical.  
  The young keep up with the fashion   
more and dress in casual,comfortable,  
bright clothes. Jeans and "Trainer"    
shoes are extremely popular.
