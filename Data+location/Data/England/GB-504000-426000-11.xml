		<content>                                       
   A new council estate of 355 houses  
 is being built in West Hull. Some of  
 the houses have people living in them 
 and some are not finished yet.        
   They are built of brick with gas    
 central heating.They have small front 
 and back gardens but no garages. Some 
 of them have a drive.                 
   Some of the houses back onto the    
 main Hull to London railway line and  
 these have a patterned gable made by  
 using different coloured bricks. They 
 can be seen by people travelling into 
 Hull.One shows two rugby players,     
 another a ship and another a train.   
 The windows of the houses are         
 incorporated in the design.           
   Most of the houses are 2 or 3 bed-  
 roomed. There are a few 5 bedroomed   
 houses for families of 9 or more.
