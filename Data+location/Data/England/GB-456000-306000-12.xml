		<content> When local schoolchildren surveyed    
 residents of Beaumont Leys they found 
 that not many people felt safe walking
 the streets at night and wanted more  
 police patrolling the area.           
 There is one mobile police station    
 staffed by 3 sergeants, 13 constables 
 and 4 CID. Each constable has a beat  
 of nearly a square km and the main    
 mode of transport is by walking       
 although Panda cars patrol at         
 night.When called out , the police are
 usually on the spot within 10         
 minutes. The majority of crimes are to
 do with burglary, vandalism or        
 domestic quarrels.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
