		<title>17Place names in Codford</title>
		<content> The Wylye Valley is called Death      
 Valley. It is named that because of   
 the number of car accidents there have
 been over the past years on the A36.  
 In Codford since 1914 there has been a
 hill called Misery Hill. It is named  
 so from the Australian and New        
 Zealand                               
 bodies that are buried there. There is
 another hill which is called Malmepit 
 Hill because there is an old chalk    
 quarry there.Cow Lane got its name    
 because cows go down it to other      
 fields.Green Lane was once a track    
 which only people on foot or horse and
 cart could go though. On each side of 
 the track there were lush green       
 fields. The Grove received its name   
 from the old Grove Farm. Cherry       
 Orchard was once a large field dotted 
 with Cherry Trees.
