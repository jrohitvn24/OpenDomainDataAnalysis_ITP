		<content> After the Ice Age the glaciers        
 retreated into the sea, the area was  
 more or less left to its own devices  
 and finally reverted back to moorland.
 When civilisation finally came to the 
 area the people were mainly farmers   
 who set about cultivating the moorland
 where the richer soil had been        
 deposited.                            
 The area at the present time is a     
 mixture of moorland, covered with     
 bracken, heather and gorse, part is   
 also forestry and farms where the soil
 is more fertile.                      
 Many streams, becks, tarns and        
 waterfalls cover the moorland making  
 parts of the moorland boggy and rich  
 in wild plant life.                   
 The area attracts much wild life, the 
 moorland providing ideal cover and    
 food for animals. The area is very    
 open.                                 </content>
