		<title>01Rural life in N.E. Leics.</title>
		<content> This quiet rural area has many farms  
 and four small villages, Scalford,    
 Wycomb, Chadwell and Goadby Marwood.  
{Scalford,}a conservation village is   
 the largest, and has the only church  
 dedicated to St. Egelwin in the       
 country.{Goadby Marwood}has large     
 fishponds, a church and a chapel.     
{Chadwell}and{Wycomb}are very small.   
     Houses in the area are mainly     
 made of ironstone or an old local     
 brick,many having been renovated in   
 recent years by newcomers to the area.
    Patterns of work have changed      
 considerably in the past few years.   
   Though farming is still the most    
 important industry,few adults earn    
 their living on the land.Many people  
 travel to work in nearby towns and    
 cities, yet find their community life 
 in the villages.
