		<title>15Farming, Rivers and Ponds.</title>
		<content>There are two farms in Ecton village   
and one on the outskirts. They are     
arable farms with sheep and cows.      
There is a farm at Great Billing with  
livestock. To the south of Ecton       
village is the river Nene which is     
navigable. To the east of the village  
is Barton Brook and to the west is     
Billing Brook.  Near Bellinge there    
are several ponds. The one nearest to  
the lower school has been there for 4  
years. It used to be a rubbish tip. It 
has many uses including fishing,       
playing, school nature walks and       
sometimes boating. Various forms of    
wild life is in evidence there - birds,
insects and animals. Also many trees   
and plants.
