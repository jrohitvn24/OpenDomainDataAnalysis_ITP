   Domesday Book said there was a mill 
in Marcham. Mrs Jones lives in the     
mill now. She said there was a Saxon   
mill which was called "Wulfmere's      
Mill". It was then called "Werg Mill". 
Werg means Willow.                     
                                       
   The mill was a corn mill. It stopped
being used about 1900.                 
                                       
   In the land around the mill the     
spring water is salt although it is 60 
miles from the sea. The Marcham mill   
owners used to have   to go to the     
village to get proper water and walk   
all the way back to the mill.Mrs Jones 
told us that a lot of salt flowers     
grow near the mill. One of these is    
wild celery, and the name Marcham      
means "the riverside meadow where the  
wild celery grows".                    </content>
