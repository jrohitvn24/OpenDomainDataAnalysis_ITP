		<content> Cornfields predominate in the centre  
 of this territory which is rather flat
 apart from the shallow valley with a  
 small stream on the west side.Areas of
 woodland are in the south and east,   
 and Hungerford Common is on the       
 northern boundary. The soil is not of 
 the best and is reckoned Grade 2;the  
 Common being only Grade 3.            
 The woodlands are mostly of a pleasant
 mixture of hardwoods and the woods    
 being private, offer a good refuge for
 wildlife, with minimal disturbance. A 
 more obvious indication of            
 conservation is the marking off with  
 stakes of a length of road (Sanham    
 Green Road) where the plant, Spiked   
 Star of Bethelem, flourishes. The aim 
 is that the plants will not be cut    
 until after flowering, but the scheme 
 often goes awry with changes in the   
 personnel responsible for cutting.    </content>
