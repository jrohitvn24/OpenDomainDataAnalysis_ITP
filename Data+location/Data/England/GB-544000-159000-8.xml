		<title>08 FARMING - NORSTED MANOR</title>
		<content> {Norsted Manor} was mentioned in the  
original Domesday Book in 1086. It is a
small manor house in the Cudham Parish.
 It is a large farm of 850 acres with  
400 acres used for growing wheat and   
barley and the remaining 450 acres used
for grazing.                           
 The farm has a flock of 350 sheep and 
a herd of 150 beef cattle. Animals are 
usually sent to market in Sevenoaks.   
 Farm workers live on the estate in    
farm cottages.                         
 There is quite a lot of {Broad-leaved 
Woodland} still standing on the estate 
and many of the trees are protected    
from felling by {preservation orders}  
placed by the London Borough of Bromley
as a conservation measure.             
 Norted Manor was the country home of  
the {Lord Mayor of London} until about 
200 years ago.
