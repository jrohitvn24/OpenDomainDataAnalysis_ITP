		<title>11OUR HOBBIES</title>
		<content>                                       
We have hobbies.   Hobbies are what you
do sometimes in your free time. Perhaps
snooker might be your hobby or sailing.
You might have just one  hobby or a few
hobbies.                               
Some hobbies  are  dangerous  like bird
shooting.  You could shoot a little boy
Some hobbies can be fun.  If your hobby
is cricket, that can be fun but you can
get hit by the ball.                   
In some hobbies you can win cups.  When
you play foot ball you can win the F.A.
Cup or the Milk Cup.                   
Some people like fishing.    They catch
fish. Some people have stamp collecting
as a hobby.   That can be very hard but
interesting.    Some like to search for
butterflies or birds.    Some people go
for walks and some like to  paint, draw
or take photographs.
