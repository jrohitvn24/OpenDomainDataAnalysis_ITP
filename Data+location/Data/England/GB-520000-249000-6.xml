		<title>06TRADE: SHOPPING</title>
		<content> My group asked children in the school 
 where their parents went shopping for 
 food and we also went to the{Market   
{Square}and asked some of the people   
 there. Most people living in{Potton   
 shop in the town. They use both local 
 supermarkets though many choose to go 
 shopping at a large supermarket in    
{Kempston.}Most of the people asked,   
 shop at least once a week and only a  
 few shop every day. Those shopping out
 of town usually just shop once a      
 month.{Fridays}and{Saturdays}were     
 popular shopping days and many people 
 use their cars to get to the shops.   
 Parking can be a problem and it is    
 hoped that a car park will be built in
 Potton, as most people, at present,   
 park around the Square. Nobody        
 shopping and living in Potton had far 
 to go as the town is quite small.
