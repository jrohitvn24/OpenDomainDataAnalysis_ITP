		<title>09Vanishing trees &amp; hedgerows</title>
		<content>This area comprises a patchwork of     
fields divided by hedgerows and trees. 
However, some hedgerows (including     
blackberry bushes) have been removed   
where crops have grown. There are fewer
mature trees, as all of the elms were  
destroyed by disease. The elms still   
standing are gradually becoming ivy-   
covered. Rooks now seem to nest        
happily in smaller trees, although     
some still use dead elms.              
Fields bordering the River Ock were    
once marsh, and were subject to        
flooding, until the river level was    
lowered in l979.
