		<content> The area is crossed by a railway line 
 linking Sheerness with the main North 
 Kent line at Sittingbourne. Whilst    
 primarily for freight to and from     
 Sheerness Steelworks and Docks, it    
 also provides a half hourly passenger 
 service with a halt at Kemsley. There 
 is an hourly bus service linking      
 Kemsley with Sittingbourne but Iwade  
 is poorly served with only four buses 
 a day. The National Bus Co run a      
 regular daily commuter service to     
 London, called 'Invictaway', which    
 passes through Iwade , Kemsley and    
 Milton. Private coach owners run      
 coaches to Maidstone market every     
 Tuesday. Because of the infrequent    
 services in many areas and as many    
 local inhabitants do not have cars    
 they beging to feel isolated.
