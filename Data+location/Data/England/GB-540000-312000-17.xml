		<title>17SHOPPING IN GOREFIELD</title>
		<content> 10 mothers from{Gorefield}completed a 
 questionaire about their shopping     
 habits. They all said that they did   
 their main shopping in nearby{Wisbech.
 8 of them shopped once a week; the    
 other 2 made shopping expeditions to  
 town on a twice_weekly basis. The new 
 covered shopping centre in            
{Peterborough}called{Queensgate}was    
 visited between 2 and 12 times a year 
 by 7 of the women. 3 ladies reported  
 that they had never been there. One   
 mother used the{village shops}often,  
 one lady never used the local shops at
 all, and the other 8 mothers used them
 for occasional items. All the women   
 preferred to use the town's shopping  
 facilities, including{Super Key,      
 because they felt that they had a     
 wider choice, and the prices were     
 lower.                                
                                       </content>
