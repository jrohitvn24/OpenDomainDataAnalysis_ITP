		<title>05HOPE FARM contd.</title>
		<content> For a good Friesian heifer just coming
 into milk you would expect to pay     
 Â£550-Â£600 now. On looking to the      
 future Mr Watts thinks the land will  
 remain as dairy pasture as that is    
 what it is best suited to being. Its  
 too damp and marshy for other crops.  
 He has not had too many problems with 
 quotas and thinks as long as people   
 continue to like milk he will be      
 supplying it. He hopes his son, who is
 already helping on the farm, will     
 carry it on after Mr Watts has        
 retired.
