		<title>14UPWOOD IN WORLD WAR II</title>
		<content> When World War II broke out A.R.P.'s  
 started patrolling the village        
 ensuring everything was in order.One  
 day some A.R.P.'s went to Mrs.Agger's 
 house and told her not to polish her  
 brass letterbox because it would      
 shine in the moonlight and bombers    
 would see it.When there were air_raids
 all the lights  were turned out.In the
 village there is a house called       
 Carlton House,it had a thatched roof  
 but in the war a plane crashed into   
 the back garden and set fire to the   
 roof.Everyone helped to get valuables 
 out of the house.During the blaze the 
 mistress said, "Hang on, I've left my 
 handbag." So she calmly went in and   
 got it.
