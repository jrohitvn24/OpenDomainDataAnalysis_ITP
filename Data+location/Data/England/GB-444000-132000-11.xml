		<title>11VICAR OF LITTLETON</title>
		<content>       We went to interview the vicar  
 of Littleton on the fourth of June.He 
 is called the{Reverend R. Le B.       
{Johnson.}He is not married and has no 
 children. He lives with his mother.   
 The vicar gave us information about   
 the church and himself.He told us that
 the church was Saxon.Then the Normans 
 destroyed it in 1066 but they rebuilt 
 it about ten years after.There is a   
 house next to the church called The   
 Monks Rest.It had been there for about
 five hundred years.A rector had never 
 lived there but the vicar thought that
 one had,because there was a lot of    
 glebe land which surrounds the        
 Rectory which belonged to previous    
 vicars.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
