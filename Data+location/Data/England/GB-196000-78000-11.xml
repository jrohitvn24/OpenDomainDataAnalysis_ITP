		<title>11Vanishing Hedgerows</title>
		<content>  A Cornish Hedge is about one and a   
 half metres tall.The sides and top are
 made out of stone and it is filled    
 with earth with grass and plants      
 growing on the top,so it makes a good 
 habitat for animals.They are mostly on
 narrow lanes so the flail mowers cut  
 them so that the holidaymakers don't  
 have any accidents.The plants in the  
 hedgerows are dying off very quickly  
 because the flowers are cut before    
 they seed,it is also destroying the   
 animals and birds homes.10 years ago  
 the people,from the Cornish Naturalist
 Trust chose a mile of hedgerow and    
 counted how many differnt species     
 were living in it. There were 150     
 differnt  plants and 28 differnt      
 birds.Now in the same mile of hedgerow
 there are only 61 plants, 35 of which 
 are threatened and only 2 different   
 species of nesting bird.              </content>
