		<title>11The Salmon Fishers</title>
		<content> There are seventeen licensed salmon   
 fishers allowed to fish the Taw and   
 Torridge estuary. They are governed as
 to the size of mesh and also the      
 length of their nets. As the tide     
 turns and is on its way in the salmon 
 fishers row small boats away from the 
 shore line. One man stays on shore    
 holding the end of the net and the    
 boatman allows the net to fall from   
 the stern of his small boat. He       
 travels in a U shape and returns to   
 the shore. The net is then hauled     
 slowly and carefully ashore and the   
 fish are trapped. This method is      
 called seine netting.                 
   We watched the men fish for about an
 hour and in that time three boats     
 landed a selection of fish. Flounders,
 grey mullet, dabs, whiting, sea trout 
 and six salmon, some quite large, made
 up the catch.                         </content>
