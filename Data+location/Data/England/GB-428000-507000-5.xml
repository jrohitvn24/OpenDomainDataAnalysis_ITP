		<content>  Every pedigree herd has its own      
 prefix, which is a name that goes     
 before the cow's name. Our prefix is  
 Cockleton. When a cow calves her calf 
 must be registered within thirty days.
 This means sending details of the calf
 to the Friesian Society. They send    
 back its registration certificate and 
 herd book number which it has for     
 life.                                 
  The conformation of the cows is very 
 important to the pedigree breeder and 
 he is always trying to improve the    
 cows, which are classified every year 
 into six grades. The best is excellent
 and the worst is poor. The aim is to  
 breed cows that give a lot of milk and
 can win shows, like the cow who gave  
 13000kg. in one lactation, winning the
 dairy farming event and being sold for
 32,000 guineas.
