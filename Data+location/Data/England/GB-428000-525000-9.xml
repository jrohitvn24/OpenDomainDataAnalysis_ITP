School playtimes are welcomed by every 
pupil. Most schools have 1-2 playtimes 
and a dinner time. Adults wonder how   
children entertain themselves, so here 
are some games children play:          
  Most boys play football on the yard. 
Coats get thrown down and play begins. 
This is nothing like the real game of  
football, anyone plays on any side!    
  Most girls play "skippy" with a      
skipping rope, a chant normally goes   
with the "skippy". Other than skipping 
girls play tiggy. This game includes   
running around, and if the person that 
is 'on' touches you then you are       
'on',ie. you begin to chase the rest.  
  At home boys either play football or 
ride around on their bikes. Girls and  
boys both play made up games and may go
to the Youth or Recreation Centre, or  
may play in the street.                </content>
