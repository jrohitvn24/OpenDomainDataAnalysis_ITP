		<content> One of the amenities in Hythe is the  
 Sailing Club. It is sited on Shore    
 Road between the Scout Hut and the US 
 Army base. It can accommodate boats   
 from a few feet long up to about 30   
 feet long, any larger and the summer  
 mooring wouldn't be able to take the  
 strain. The moorings are divided into 
 two sections. There are some out by   
 the army barges and the rest are the  
 other side of the army base, off      
 Waitrose car park. There are two      
 categories of mooring, those which dry
 out and those which don't. The smaller
 boats with lifting keels and bilge    
 keels go on the mud, and the larger   
 boats go on the deep moorings. In the 
 winter the boats are kept in a pound. 
 This has power points and a special   
 hose for cleaning boats. There is a   
 clubhouse which has a bar, galley and 
 a changing room with showers.         </content>
