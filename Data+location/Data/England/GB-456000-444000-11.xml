		<content> Because of our close proximity to the 
 ancient city of York and because we   
 are on the main railway route and     
 close to major motorways we are in the
 centre of one country's major tourist 
 areas.Naburn has 4 camp sites,a marina
 ,a public house and a banqueting hall.
 Acaster Malbis has a thriving river_  
 side public house 5 camp and caravan  
 sites and a beautiful guest house to  
 accomedate visitors to the area.Cop_  
 manthorpe,as yet,has no facilities    
 for tourism although it does have two 
 public houses which attracts passing  
 as well as local trade.There are often
 long queues along the A64 motorway in 
 the summertime when traffic gets      
 conjested on it's way to York or to   
 the East coastal resorts of Scar_     
 borough,Filey and Bridlington.
