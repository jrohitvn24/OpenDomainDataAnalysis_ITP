      The Chapmans who have a small    
 farm have recently started a butchers 
 in the converted utility room at the  
 back of their house.  They sell pork  
 from their own pigs which are sent    
 away for slaughter and then butchered 
 by a retired butcher who lives in     
 Maple Gardens.  The beef they sell is 
 sometimes from their own bullock.     
      In addition to these facilites in
 the village there are several mobile  
 services - two butchers bring their   
 vans twice a week, two fishmongers    
 come once a week, the baker three     
 times, a library van twice, and milk  
 is delivered daily to each house by   
 one of two milkmen.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
