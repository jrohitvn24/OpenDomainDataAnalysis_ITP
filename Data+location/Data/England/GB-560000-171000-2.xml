		<title>02The A2 - Blessing or Burden?</title>
		<content> The A2 (known locally as the motorway)
 runs from Dover to London and is built
 over the first ever Roman road-Watling
 Street.Traffic reaches its peak during
 the early morning and evening rush    
 hours but,by mid-morning vehicles are 
 still passing at the rate of one per  
 second.A survey carried out by pupils 
 at Painters Ash CP School,which lies  
 next to the road,revealed that local  
 residents found it convenient to live 
 close to the road as it offers easy   
 access to London and the Kent coast.  
 But living so near does have its      
 drawbacks.A majority had found it     
 necessary to fit double-glazing to    
 keep out traffic noise.There was much 
 concern about possible health risks   
 from breathing in poisonous traffic   
 fumes and many felt that lead-free    
 petrol should be introduced.However,  
 most people wished to stay.           </content>
