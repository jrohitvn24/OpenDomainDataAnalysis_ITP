		<content>   Mr. Best finds that as well as being
 able to socialise more easily, being  
 president of his union has helped him 
 gain in confidence.                   
   He visualises education in the      
 future going towards more individual  
 tutoring, and people wil use distance 
 learning programs. He also believes   
 that the school will be more of a     
 comunity centre with both adults and  
 children using its facilities.        
   In his year of office Mr. Best hopes
 to achieve a successful conclusion to 
 the present pay dispute between       
 teachers and their employers. He would
 like to see a pay award to the        
 teachers, he would also like to see an
 independent body set up to deal with  
 the role of a teacher and salary      
 structure.He would like all these     
 things linked to a no-strike deal.    
 These are his objectives.             </content>
