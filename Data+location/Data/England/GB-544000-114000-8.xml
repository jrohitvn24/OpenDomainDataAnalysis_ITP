		<content> The area suffered heavily from the    
 effects of Dutch Elm Disease but both 
 the Parish Council and private        
 individuals have planted many trees in
 the area to replace those destroyed.  
 Care has been taken in recent years to
 reduce the cutting of verges to allow 
 animal and plant communities to       
 flourish.                             
  In the woodland there is some        
 management with both fencing and      
 felling (with the felled wood being   
 removed. There is little evidence of  
 any chemical polution but high levels 
 of acid rainfall have been recorded in
 the area.                             
  Local people have made a great deal  
 of effort to keep the public footpaths
 open. There has however been some     
 resistance from a few of the farmers.
