		<title>03VILLAGE SHOP FAIRWARP</title>
		<content> We went in the mini-bus to Fairwarp to
 see a shop. When we arrived there we  
 saw it had a Post-Office, drinks,     
 puddings, pens, pencils, paper,       
 ice-cream, lollies, dogfood and       
 catfood and everything you could wish 
 for.                                  
 It was interesting to hear that only  
 two people run it, and they have been 
 there for quite a long time. One of   
 the ladies took us behind the counter 
 of the post-office and explained that 
 she kept over 100 stamps. The shop is 
 hidden along a country lane and often 
 hitch-hikers and cyclists holidaying  
 in England come in to ask the way. It 
 is the only shop in the village and   
 mainly elderly people without cars use
 it; the younger people go to Brighton 
 or East Grinstead to the bigger shops.
