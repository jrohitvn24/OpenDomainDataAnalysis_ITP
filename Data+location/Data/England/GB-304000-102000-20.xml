		<title>20A THOUGHT FROM PLYMTREE</title>
		<content> "THE SPONSOR"                         
 It would be  nice if we could be      
 A village set beside the sea          
 "A good idea" the host replied        
 I'm sure we could be if we tried.     
 Now sponsoring's the thing to do      
 You sponsor me, I'll sponsor you      
 And get your friends from far and wide
 All open pursed and starry eyed.      
 We'll start the dig at Hare and Hounds
 You dig from home, I'm Sidmouth bound 
 Soon all the world will speak         
 Of Pretty Plymtree on the creek.      
 And then the visitors will come       
 Leaving litter by the ton             
 And where the bus shelter once stood  
 They'll be selling hot dogs and fancy 
                                 goods.
 And could life ever be the same       
 With go-carting down Greenend         
 Do you think it might be best         
 If we voted for a sponsored rest?     </content>
