		<title>11Kettering's Caravan Centre</title>
		<content>  Caravanning in the 80's is extremely 
popular and has become big business.   
  Sited at Windy Ridge just off        
Warkton Lane and almost hidden to      
general view is Kestral Caravan Centre 
and Peak's Storage Park.               
  There is a most attractive camp site 
for up to 30 caravans with the usual   
facilities and children's swings.      
  An accessory shop caters for the     
needs of the caravanner and a hire     
fleet  of 20 caravans is available.    
These are used extensively and         
especially for the Silverstone Grand   
Prix and Burleigh Horse Trials.        
  A gravel surfaced storage area       
accommodates 410 caravans  and the     
demand is such that 100 more places    
could be utilised.                     
  At any one time there are around 30  
caravans for sale either at Windy Ridge
or the town centre sales area.         </content>
