		<title>14FARMING IN A-J-M.</title>
		<content> This is a farmed area and{dairying}is 
 the main type of farming.However quite
 a few flocks of{sheep}are to be seen; 
 they are not usually owned by farmers 
 in this area but this land is rented  
 out to them when no longer needed for 
 the cattle.{Chickens,ducks and an odd 
{pig and quite a few horses}are kept.  
 The{size}of farm varies between 40 and
 240 acres and field size is about 4   
 acres.The{grass}is intensively managed
 and the land is rarely ploughed.The   
 nearest{cattle market}is in Crewe on  
 Mondays.A local beef farmer also mends
 tractors and other farming implements 
 of which there seem to be many.Most of
 the farms are family concerns,only the
 biggest employ outside labour.Perhaps 
 a quarter of the farms are tenanted.  
 Other residents are involved in       
 related jobs,ie.potato marketing      
 board and there is a mobile farrier.  </content>
