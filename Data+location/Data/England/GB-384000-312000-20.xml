		<content>Lap@ley is a small village with some   
fifty seven dwellings.Twenty five or   
so having been built in the last       
thirty years.At the moment two more    
are being built.                       
  There is a Parish Church which was   
built during the years 1063 - 1414     
by the Abbots of St.Remigius who       
were lords of the manor upto the       
time of the dissolution of the Alien   
Priories by Henry V ,in the year 1414. 
   At the moment there are two families
farming in the village.Dairy and arable
farming approx 2000 acres.             
    We also have a "Pub"- the Vaughan  
Arms which has recently been           
refurbished and extended.The name no   
doubt having been derived from an old  
Lapley familyÂ£The Vaughans' who owned  
Lapley Estates till approx 1920.
