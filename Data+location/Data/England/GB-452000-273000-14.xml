		<title>14The Oxford Canal</title>
		<content>    The inland Waterways or canals are 
 an interesting feature of our         
 countryside.Their brightly decorated  
 barges can be seen carrying goods     
 between London and other industrial   
 areas.                                
    From Coventry's boundary,the Oxford
 Canal passes Ansty and Brinklow,      
 through Newbold,Clifton upon Dunsmore 
 then on to Hillmorton and Willoughby. 
 It passes approximately half a        
 kilometre from our school. The Oxford 
 Canal goes on to link up with the     
 Grand Union Canal at Braunston, which 
 in turn links the rural district with 
 London.At Napton There is a junction  
 with the Birmingham and Warwick Canal.
    Because of the demand for holidays 
 on the canals in recent years, a      
 company has been established near     
 Hillmorton Locks to hire canal boats.
