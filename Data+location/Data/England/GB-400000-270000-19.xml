		<title>19The School Pageant</title>
		<content>    Our pageant this year will be about
 forests. We have chosen a certain     
 number of songs, poems, mime, music   
 and plays. We have a guitar, a        
 clarinet, and some recorders  to play 
 the music for us. Our plays "The Tree 
 God", "The Silver Groat", and "The    
 Robin Hood Ballad" will be acted.     
 There is a story called "The Squirrel 
 Wife" which is told by the child in   
 the top year called Sally Warne. The  
 play "The Silver Groat" is about a    
 young boy called Hugh Lambert who     
 meets King Edward 1st and they have a 
 shooting contest using a bow and      
 arrow. King Edward is played by Simon 
 Adams, and Lambert is played by Philip
 Coghlan. The trees and woods have     
 gifts for us, and they breath life    
 into our world. Without trees none of 
 us could live.
