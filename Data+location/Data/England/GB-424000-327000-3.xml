		<title>03EGGINTON POST OFFICE</title>
		<content>     The Post Office is in the centre  
 of the village, and is joined to the  
 school. About three years ago the shop
 was at the end of Duck Street which is
 just inside Egginton. It has now been 
 moved to the old school house.        
     The postmistress has two jobs,the 
 first as school caretaker the second  
 is to take care of the shop. The      
 postmistress opens the shop at 9.00am 
 every day apart from Sunday when the  
 shop is closed. At the end of the day 
 she closes the shop at 5.30pm. Her    
 busiest day is Thursday which is      
 pensions day. She sells mostly day to 
 day sorts of things, like sweets,     
 groceries and bread, because most     
 people do their weekly shopping at    
 Burton.
