		<content> At the East end of Mark on the        
 Blackford Road are the{Saw Mills}of   
 Ivor Morgan where wood comes in to be 
 cut into pit props and other          
 commercial needs.                     
 Opposite the Church Amesbury and      
 Puddy have a{Blacksmith}business. Mr  
 Amesbury is a{Farrier}and with so many
 ponies and riding hacks around he is  
 kept very busy.                       
 Mr Creber's{Joinery}business is next  
 door. His father owned the Joinery    
 before him and was the village        
 carpenter. He used to use local elm to
 make the goods but now it is usually  
 Mahogany and other hardwood from S.   
 America,making staircases and window- 
 frames. Mr Creber's and Amesbury and  
 Puddy's,together with Avery's Garage  
 next door make up what was Wensley's  
 Horse Drawn Waggon,Car and Wheelwright
 Works-an old local family business.   </content>
