		<title>06NAFFIT'S FARM</title>
		<content> There are two farms in this area,     
 Naffit's Farm and Grange Farm. Both   
 farms are occupied. About 80% of the  
 land is arable, with the remaining 20%
 being grazing. Some of the fields     
 contained cattle, and there were a few
 sheep to be seen.                     
 Running north-south in the area is a  
 class 2 road, the B1363, which leads  
 from York to Helmsley.                
 The south west corner of the area is  
 crossed by energy pylons.             
 All fields are bordered by            
 well-established hawthorn hedges,     
 which are in some places very         
 overgrown. However the hedge bordering
 the B1363 is much tidier. The grass   
 verges by the road had been trimmed   
 recently.                             
 A right of way runs from the B1363 in 
 an easterly direction to join Bull    
 Lane at Rosecroft Farm.               </content>
