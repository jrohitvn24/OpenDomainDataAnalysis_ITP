		<content>   In Cherry Willingham there is a     
 range of entertainment from bowls to  
 football to disco's. At the village   
 hall there are disco's at least once a
 month; dancing is therefore important 
 to the life of the community. There is
 a school of dancing where pupils from 
 3yrs. to 19yrs. in the village hall   
 with most lessons in the evenings.    
   Sport also plays an important role  
 in the spare time of people from this 
 area. Football, tennis, netball, bowls
 cricket and many other games are      
 provided for in the villages.         
   The area has a Youth Club where     
 people from 13yrs. to 18yrs. can go   
 and play indoor games and enjoy       
 themselves. Youth clubs not only      
 entertain the youths, they also keep  
 them out of trouble.
