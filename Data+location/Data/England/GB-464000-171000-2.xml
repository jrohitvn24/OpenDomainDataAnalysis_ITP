		<content> As the Calcot Area is growing so fast 
 people have not had time to form      
 hardened attitudes to new             
 developments.However,after the initial
 objections,most people feel that the  
 new Savacentre hypermarket is a good  
 thing,since it provides jobs and      
 excellent shopping facilities.Some    
 people mourn the loss of the 'Corner  
 shop'.Bus transport is felt to be     
 adequate.Most people are pleased with 
 the ease of movement afforded by the  
 A4 and M4.There is mixed feeling about
 the new mini-roundabouts.Local people 
 are concerned about the rapid growth  
 in housing,and it's affect on the     
 environment.The new 'Wheelie bins' for
 household rubbish disposal are well   
 received.Most people feel there should
 be more facilities for the growing    
 population.                           
                                       </content>
