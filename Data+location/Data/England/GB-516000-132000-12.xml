		<title>12The Northern Bypass</title>
		<content> The bypass is being built to relieve  
 traffic from the centre of Horsham.   
 Most of the traffic that goes through 
 Horsham comes from other towns to     
 Crawley, Gatwick and Brighton via     
 Horsham.  The bypass will pass through
 farmland mostly rough grazing and     
 silage, but some fields are used for  
 crops.  The bypass will measure about 
 5 kilometres when it is finished in   
 about 5 years.                        
                                       
 There are lots of different machines  
 being used including bulldozers,      
 rollers and cranes.  The contractors  
 are having to bank it up because the  
 ground is uneven and they have to make
 a bridge to go over the main line     
 railway.  They are also building a    
 roundabout to join the bridge to the  
 existing Crawley road.  The noise and 
 dust annoys people who live nearby.   </content>
