		<title>11Wildlife in Cranbrook</title>
		<content>There is probably a wider variety of   
wildlife in Cranbrook now than there   
was 50 years ago.With the continual    
building of houses and the encroachment
 of the surrounding countryside,the    
felling of copses and woods,and        
scrubbing of hedgerows,the animals have
addapt to living nearer to people.It is
common sight to see squirrels in the   
tall trees surrounding the churchyard. 
But by the library there is a small    
pond formed by water from a pipe.A     
large variety of birds can be seen     
playing and bathing in the trickle of  
water,especially sparrows,starlings,   
blackbirds and thrushes.There seems to 
be a thriving population of rabbits and
hedgehogs leaving telltale signs of    
their presence.Snakes and slow-worms   
can be seen bobbing in the sun in the  
churchyard.Foxes rummage through bins  
at night looking for scraps.           </content>
