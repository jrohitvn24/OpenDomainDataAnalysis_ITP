		<title>01THE TEMPLE NORMANTON AREA</title>
		<content> The area was once dominated by the    
 coal mining industry. Villages grew as
 the mines were developed. Now the     
 mines are closed and the spoil heaps  
 which once covered the area are being 
 removed and the land being reclaimed  
 for farming and recreation.           
                                       
 The area is mainly agricultural but   
 there are two small villages.         
                                       
{Temple Normanton}is one of the        
 smallest parishes in the county,      
 covering an area of about 500 acres.  
 There is a small school in the village
 but no shops.                         
                                       
{Grassmoor}is a residential village    
 close to Chesterfield. It has a small 
 shopping centre, school and an N.C.B. 
 Training Centre.
