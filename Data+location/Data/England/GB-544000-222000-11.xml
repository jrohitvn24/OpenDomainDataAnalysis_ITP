		<title>11TRAFFIC SURVEY ON THE A120</title>
		<content>     Morning and evening rush hours are
 very busy but the A120 is still quite 
 busy throughout the day with on       
 average 10 vehicles every minute. The 
 majority of the vehicles are cars     
 (70%). Of the remaining percentage 29%
 are lorries or vans whilst 1% only are
 motorcycles or bicycles. The A120     
 carries quite alot of container       
 lorries travelling to and from        
 Felixstowe and Harwich. Little Hadham 
 suffers from the noise and air        
 pollution which results from this     
 traffic. The crossroads in the village
 have traffic lights because the road  
 is narrow. These lights cause long    
 traffic queues at peak times both     
 during the day and especially at      
 holiday periods. The queue westbound  
 quite often reaches up to Hadham Hall 
 School's drive. Based on a survey by  
 1C.                                   </content>
