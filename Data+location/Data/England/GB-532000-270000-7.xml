		<title>07A 11yrs Old Child's Weekend.</title>
		<content> On Saturday I wake up at about 8am and
 watch T.V and have breakfast before   
 washing and dressing. At midday we    
 collect Mum from work by car and have 
 lunch.In the afternoon my brother and 
 sister visit my nan while Mum ,Dad and
 I go shopping at Cambridge where I    
 usually spend my pocket money on a    
 record.In the evening I watch T.V.    
 before getting ready for bed although 
 I do not go to sleep before I have a  
 drink and read a little.              
 On Sunday I don't really get up before
 11a.m. and by the time I've had toast 
 for breakfast it's time to fetch Mum  
 from work. After dinner and perhaps a 
 trip to, and stroll around St Neots, I
 play with Samantha.                   
 Occasionally my granddad visits us in 
 the evening after which it's time for 
 a bath,television and bed.
