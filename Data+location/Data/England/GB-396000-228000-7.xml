		<title>07Dixton Farm,Dixton</title>
		<content> Dixton Farm is 2 miles to the east of 
 Gotherington.It spreads over a wide   
 area and not all the fields are next  
 to each other.Mr.Jewer,the farm       
 manager, has supplied us with the     
 following information.The farm is     
 mostly arable. They plant a crop of   
 beans every four years.Altogether the 
 farm covers 760 acres.They regularly  
 spray crops so that they do not get   
 'chocolate drop' on them.They do have 
 some livestock including 27 sheep.    
 There are three staff including       
 Mr.Jewer. The parts which cannot be   
 farmed on they plant with trees.There 
 are no orchards,however,on this farm. 
 There have been many changes in the   
 last ten years. The biggest change was
 from sheep and cattle farming to      
 arable farming. Arable farming is     
 easier and more profitable.
