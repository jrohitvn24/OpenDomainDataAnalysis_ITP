		<content> South of the B63l7 are three lanes,   
 two leading to Sunniside, the third to
 Burnopfield. Along and between these  
 Whickham's residential area can be    
 found.                                
  It is an interesting mixture of stone
 houses and small terraces built before
 the end of the l9th. century, mixed in
 with very large houses built up to    
 World War II. New luxury homes have   
 appeared lately on 'infill' sites.    
 Apart from a number of former colliery
 houses, now privately owned, and a    
 small council estate with a few       
 surviving 'prefabs', the bulk of the  
 post war housing is on new private    
 estates, built to satisfy a desire for
 good quality suburban housing. The    
 estates are spacious and retain many  
 mature trees. The semi-rural          
 atmosphere and excellent facilities   
 make it a desirable place to live.    </content>
