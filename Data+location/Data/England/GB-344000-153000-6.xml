 There are several historic buildings  
 in Cheddar including St.Andrew's      
 Church,two Elizabethan manor houses,  
 other 17th.and 18th.century buildings,
 the ruins of a Saxon palace where the 
 King's of Wessex Upper School now     
 stands,but the one that most people   
 know about is CHEDDAR MARKET CROSS.   
 The Cross dates from the 15th.century.
 but during the 16th.century,arches and
 a roof were added.It was originally   
 used as a preaching cross and also    
 used as a news gathering place.It was 
 also where merchants bought and sold  
 goods.Today it is used as a decoration
 and children play on it.The Market    
 Cross stands at the junction of Union 
 Street,Church Street and Bath Street. 
 Cheddar First School has adopted it as
 its school badge.
