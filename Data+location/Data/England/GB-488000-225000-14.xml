		<content> The Grand Union canal which passes    
 through Linslade is one of the most   
 important and interesting of all      
 canals in Britain. The Grand Union    
 Canal Society was founded in the mid  
 sixties to seek conservation of the   
 canal when it was threatened with     
 closure. The Society maintains a close
 interest in life on the waterway as   
 well as a watching brief over threats 
 to the fabric of the canal and        
 adjacent buildings. Of particular     
 concern are long term structural      
 failures again threatening the very   
 future of the canal and the           
 preservation of the essential         
 character of the Grand Union canal. In
 this area it traverses a surprising   
 amount of very peaceful and delightful
 rural countryside. It is hoped to make
 the canal a National Park linking     
 London to other centres of population.</content>
