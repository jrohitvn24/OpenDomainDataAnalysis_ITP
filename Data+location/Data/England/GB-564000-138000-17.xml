		<content>   One of the penalties we are all     
 paying for the{misuse of weed_killer  
 is the gradual disappearance of our   
 country lanes and their flora and     
 fauna.Weed_killer is used along the   
 verge edges of our narrow lanes;      
 everything growing is destroyed; the  
 rain falls,and the bare earth is      
 washed away from the sides of the     
 roads leaving dangerous edges.The     
 council come along and lay tarmac over
 these edges.Later on when the roads   
 are resurfaced,they are mended to the 
 limits of the new tarmac,{widening the
{road,}making way for bigger and       
 heavier lorries.The edges of the road 
 are really unstable because they have 
 no foundation.                        
   Alas, we are being robbed of our    
 peaceful flower and animal populated  
 country lanes.
