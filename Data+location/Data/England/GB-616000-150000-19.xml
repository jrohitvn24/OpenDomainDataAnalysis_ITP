		<content> A landscape, highly rated as a conser-
 vation area, is very low on the list  
 for development and provision of amen-
 ities. A 1984 Village Appraisal asks: 
 "What do you do with a Bishopsbourne  
 landscape which has outlived the      
 social and economic conditions which  
 created it?" The dilema is how can the
 community evolve and grow, yet retain 
 its unique rural character? In recent 
 years, people have left the parish ow-
 ing to the absence of suitable houses.
 More housing of tasteful design would 
 be desirable for young people and fam-
 ilies but often planning policies work
 against this. A larger, well-balanced 
 population would help revitalise the  
 community and give support to its     
 trade and social life. The Appraisal  
 highlighted other concerns including: 
 traffic congestion and lack of public 
 transport, amenities and entertainment</content>
