		<title>07Banwell Carnival Week</title>
		<content>    Since 1978 a Carnival has been held
 during the last week in July. Annual  
 events are the family sports evening, 
 the boat race and a procession on the 
 last day.                             
    The River Banwell is dammed to     
 raise its depth for the boat race.    
 Children, and adults, spend hours     
 planning and building their rafts     
 (usually oil drums and planks) for the
 big day. The race is as much fun for  
 the spectators as it is for the       
 entrants, some of the audience        
 becoming as wet as the "sailors".     
    The procession on Saturday is led  
 by the Carnival Princess and her      
 attendants, chosen from the village   
 girls under 16. Local families or     
 clubs enter floats, or walk in fancy  
 dress through the village to the      
 recreation field where there are many 
 stalls and fairground entertainments. </content>
