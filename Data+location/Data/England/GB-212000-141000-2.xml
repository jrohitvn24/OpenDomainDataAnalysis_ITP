		<content> In the east is The Landing Beach which
 is the only place on the island which 
 gives relatively easy access from the 
 sea.A small track, clinging           
 precariously to the cliffs,leads to   
 the main settlement on the plateau-   
 like top.                             
 The South Light tops the Lametor      
 peninsula and is joined to the mass   
 by a narrow saddle of crumbling shale.
 (Most of Lundy is granite but part of 
 the S.E.is composed of some greatly   
 contorted sedimentary rocks and the   
 erosion has been very uneven).        
 Further east is Rat Island which is   
 accessable by wading at low tide.The  
 spongy grassland and differing flora  
 results from the lack of grazing.There
 is a natural tunnel which goes right  
 under Rat Island.                     
 Above,Marisco Castle commands both the
 Landing Beach and the Bristol Channel.</content>
