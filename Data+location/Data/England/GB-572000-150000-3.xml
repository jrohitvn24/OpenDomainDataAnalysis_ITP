 Coxheath Infant School opened in      
 September 1974 on the same campus as  
 the existing Primary school.  The     
 Infant School has been built around a 
 central square courtyard with         
 classrooms forming two sides and the  
 hall and kitchen area completing the  
 square.  Since opening, the school has
 had 15 members of staff, including the
 present staff and has at present (July
 1985) 150 children on roll.           
                                       
 Depending on their date of birth,     
 children would normally spend two     
 years at the school before            
 transferring to the Junior School.
