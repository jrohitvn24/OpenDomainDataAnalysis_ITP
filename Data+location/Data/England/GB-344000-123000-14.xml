		<content> Manor Farm: Next to the Church, the   
 original building was a priory and    
 parsonage. The extant dwelling is     
 mainly Elizabethan. There is l5th     
 Century glass inserted into the       
 fabric, apparently to save it during  
 the Reformation.                      
 Long Sutton House: The largest house  
 in the area. Parts of the house date  
 from the Tudor period. A magnificent  
 mews was converted to a carriage      
 house, and is now an annexe. The      
 garden was designed by Paxton.        
 Manor House Farm: A good example of   
 domestic architecture. The house and  
 environs were used by the forces of   
 Charles, Cromwell and Monmouth. The   
 House was connected to the Court House
 by an underground passage.
