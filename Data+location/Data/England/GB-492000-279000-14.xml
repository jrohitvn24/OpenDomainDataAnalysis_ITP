  Inside, the pews and choir stalls are
made of wood and are well polished. Two
pews have a cross on them.These are six
rounded arches inside the church, three
on each side. At the back of the church
there is the belfry with five bells. A 
peal of bells was rung in July 1981 to 
celebrate the wedding of Prince Charles
and Lady Diana.                        
  Above the altar are four stained     
glass windows of St. Peter, St. Paul,  
St. James and St. John.                
  The lectern held a very old bible    
with the letter 'f' instead of our 's'.
Jesus was written Jefuf.
