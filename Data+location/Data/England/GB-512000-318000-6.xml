		<content>    For a person without a car living  
 in this corner of Lincolnshire can be 
 a very daunting experience.  There are
 no shops, public houses or any other  
 form of amenity and the nearest towns 
 are four and seven miles away at      
 Bourne and Spalding respectively.     
    There is a limited bus service run 
 by the Delaine Bus Company from Bourne
 to Twenty on three days of the week,  
 Tuesday and the Bourne market days of 
 Thursday and Saturday.  At present the
 subsidized adult return fare from     
 Bourne to Twenty is 40 pence.         
    The previously convenient rail con-
 nection to both Bourne and Spalding   
 was finally closed in 1965.           
    There is no regular bus service bet
 ween Bourne and South Fen/Tongue End. 
    However, children at both hamlets  
 receive free transport to schools in  
 Bourne.                               </content>
