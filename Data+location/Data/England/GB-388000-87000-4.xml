		<content>  Wareham is a{commercial centre}being 
 the only main town serving the local  
 villages between Poole, Swanage and   
 Dorchester.  The development of a new 
 shopping centre and the new Wareham   
 by-pass; which has greatly eased the  
 traffic congestion which in Wareham   
 has made the town a much more relaxing
 place to be in.  Tourists can now     
 enjoy and appreciate a much more      
 relaxed stay in Wareham than was      
 possible 5 years ago.                 
 The outlying area to the North West of
 Wareham is mainly heath land.  The    
 land area is split by the river Piddle
 (Trent).  {Large sections of the block
{are given over to Forest and gravel   
{mining.  }There are{no other villages 
 or small towns within the area.
