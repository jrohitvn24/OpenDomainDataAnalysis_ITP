		<content> The area we studied lies mainly to the
 south of the A 370 road from          
 Bristol to Weston-super-Mare between  
 the small village of Hewish and the   
 larger village of Congresbury. It also
 includes the hamlet of Puxton.        
                                       
 The area is almost exclusively        
 farmland. It is mainly very flat      
 pasture and has to be drained. This is
 because it is watered by the          
 Congresbury Yeo River which is very   
 slow running.                         
 The villages are mainly devoted to    
 farming with the exception of         
 Congresbury which is a commuter       
 village. Congresbury has a population 
 of 3524 and Puxton just 215           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
