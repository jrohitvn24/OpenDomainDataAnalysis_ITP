		<title>15THE SURROUNDING COUNTRYSIDE</title>
		<content> The land surrounding our area affects 
 it a lot.This is due to the fact that 
 many of the people who live in the    
 village ,actually work away from the  
 village.                              
         There are three R.A.F.        
 stations in the proximity.These being:
         1)R.A.F. CRANWELL             
         2)R.A.F. DIGBY                
         3)R.A.F. CONINGSBY            
        All three have a lot of people 
 in residence and it tends to be on the
 increase.                             
          There are also FIVE towns or 
 cities that are within easy reach of  
{RUSKINGTON.}This and the R.A.F. tend  
 to make the village a place where many
 people live, but only so that they can
 be within reach of their work and also
 away from work at home.
