		<title>14Winford Manor</title>
		<content> Winford Manor is 3/4 of a mile        
 from Winford village,in a densly      
 wooded coppice.                       
 The 19th Century Manor house was built
 by the Cripps family,Lords of the     
 Manor who owned Felton Common.They are
 believed to be relatives of Captain   
 Mark Phillips,the husband of Princess 
 Anne.                                 
   During the 1st World War the Parish 
 Council was appointed Lord of the     
 Manor,and the house and land were     
 bought by Captain Harvey who started  
 poultry farming,later operated by     
 Lyditte Chicks.                       
   The property is now owned by a Mr   
 George,and the house is divided into  
 five flats.The wooden outbuildings,   
 showing signs of the older poultry    
 business,are still there,but are      
 beginning to look rather derelict.
