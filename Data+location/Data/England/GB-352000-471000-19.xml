		<content> This village and the area around it is
 mainly a farming area. The most common
 animal found in the fields is probably
 sheep but there are a few cows, beef  
 and dairy. One of the main buildings  
 in Capernwray is the Hall which is    
 occupied by students from all over the
 world. The Hall ia an educational     
 place for the Christians of the world,
 and is also a holiday centre, for     
 Christians.Also of importance in this 
 area is the railway which runs from   
 Carnforth to Skipton, carrying        
 passangers and industrial products.   
 Another building which features       
 largely in the life of this small     
 village is the chapel.Capernwray is   
 only a small place with about 15-20   
 inhabitants.The last main feature is  
 the forest owned by the forestry      
 commision,which they are clearing at  
 present and selling the wood.         </content>
