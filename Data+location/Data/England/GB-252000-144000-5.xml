 village new bungalows and houses have 
 been built.There are three shops in   
 the viiage, a Post Office-Stores,     
 Manor stores and a Butchers shop  Miss
 Muffets tea rooms opens in the summer.
 The roads into the village are narrow 
 and windy. Berrynarbor is a very well 
 cared for village. This year we are   
 entering the best kept village        
 competition. Lots of people come to   
 walk around the village because it is 
 so pretty. People keep their gardens  
 looking attractive by planting flowers
 in their gardens and putting          
 baskets and boxes of flowers          
 outside the house.There is also       
 a very popular Pub in the village.
