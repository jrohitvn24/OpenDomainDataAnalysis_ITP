		<title>11Running A Marathon</title>
		<content> Each year a marathon is held in       
 London. People from all over the world
 take part. The people have to run 26  
 miles 385 yards. The people give the  
 money to charity. Oakmere Schools     
 Headmaster took part and raised 1000  
 pounds it helped to buy a mini-bus for
 the school. Oakmere School organised a
 micro-marathon in which St.Giles and  
 Wroxham Schools took part. The third  
 and fourth years had to run round the 
 football pitch then the first and     
 second years started. When I ran round
 the field I nearly fell over. When I  
 was at the tree I had a rest and then 
 I was off again. As I reached the     
 cricket nets I was very tired I felt  
 like dropping out because I had pains 
 and stitches. My muscles were really  
 straining but as I was coming to the  
 finish everyone was cheering. Everyone
 who finished got a certificate.       </content>
