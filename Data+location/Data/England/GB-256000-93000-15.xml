		<title>15THE RAILWAY IN OKEHAMPTON</title>
		<content> Okehampton station was open in 1871   
 for the London and South Weatern      
 Railway on its route to Plymouth. The 
 opening was delayed by construction   
 difficulties across the edge of the   
 moor. (Perhaps the modern by-pass     
 engineers should make note!) The      
 railway became an important employer  
 in the town until the decline in the  
 1960's and eventual closure in 1972.  
 Today the station stands empty in its 
 commanding position above the town.   
 The line is still open to British     
 Rail's Meldon Quarry 2km to the west. 
 In April 1985 it was annouced that    
 West Devon Council had arranged for   
 trains to on four Saturdays in the    
 summer. This would allow tourist to   
 visit the town and shoppers time in   
 Exeter. The first trip left Okehampton
 with 150 passengers and very few spare
 seats. A good start to a bold venture.</content>
