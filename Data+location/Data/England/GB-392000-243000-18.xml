 The area is dominated by{Bredon Hill} 
 and the romans had a signal station on
 the summit. An{Iron Age fort}was the  
 scene of a massacre and extensive     
 earthworks indicate its importance.   
{The Benedictine Abbey of Holy Cross  }
 was founded over 1,000 years ago and  
 contains some of the finest examples  
 of Norman architecture in England.    
 The Abbey church survived the         
 Reformation but the abbey buildings   
 were destroyed and the stone found its
 way into many local buildings.        
 During the{Civil War}the town switched
 its allegiance from King to Parliament
 as the circumstances dictated.  The   
 town bridge was blown up by the       
 Royalists as they retreated.  William 
 Joyce of{'Lord Haw Haw'}fame, lived in
 the High Street and ran an office for 
 the{British Fascist Movement.}        </content>
