		<title>15Life on a farm in Stithians</title>
		<content> I am a nine year old girl. My parents 
 get up at 5 a.m. every day            
 to milk the cows. Two hours later I   
 get up. We don't have much chance to  
 play. Sometimes farming is hard       
 especially in the Winter. It takes us 
 about two hours to milk 90 cows. We   
 have another 22 cows which  have been 
 dried off so they don't produce       
 milk to prepare them for their        
 calves which are due in August and    
 September. In the summer you have not 
 got much time to go to the beach      
 because you have to carry the hay,    
 straw and corn and you have to put the
 kale in the ground. I help feed the   
 calves in the morning one of the boys 
 in my class helps in the evening. I   
 like it in the Summer best when the   
 weather is good. I enjoy hay making.
