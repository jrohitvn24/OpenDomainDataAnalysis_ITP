 The countryside around Hartlip held in
 the past, three manors-Yaugher,Hartlip
 &amp; Grayney.From these manors remain two
 impressive manor houses.{Yaugher}had  
 the manor house Queendown Warren.This 
 was built in 1560 using oak bought    
 from Henry 8th.In 1841 the owner chose
 to move the house to a new site.The   
 local wagoner &amp; his men took down the 
 house and moved it a few miles to its 
 present location on Queendown Warren  
 alongside the nature reserve.The house
 which is a listed building is a lovely
 Tudor Manor.The interior contains maps
 charters &amp; artefacts dating back many 
 centuries.{Hartlip Place Manor}was    
 built in 1809 replacing a former one  
 built 500 years earlier,which had     
 fallen into disrepair.The gardens are 
 opened at certain times in summer.
