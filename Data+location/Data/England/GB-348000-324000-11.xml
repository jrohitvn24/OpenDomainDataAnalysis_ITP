<title>11Sleap Airfeld in 1985</title>
<content>Sleap Airfield is owned by a private company called "Don International" who use the runways during the day to test vehicles.  At weekends and in the evening in the summer the Airfield is used by Shropshire Aeroclub Limited who have 2 three seater Cessna 150's and 1 four seater Piper Cherokee 180 training aircraft. These aircraft are kept in a hangar on the airfield when not in use. Members of the club also fly their own aircraft from this airfield and leave them in 5 other hangars when they are not using them. The club uses the airfield control tower and has a Chief Flying Instructor and several other instructors. Gliding also takes place at the airfield, using a powered aircraft to tow the glider to flying height. Article written in 1985.</content>
