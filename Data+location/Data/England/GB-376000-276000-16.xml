		<content>      The banks on both sides of the   
 River Severn can be walked, through   
 meadows and woods. The main fish are  
 Chub and Barbel, for which this is the
 best reach in the Midlands. Fishing   
 rights are owned by clubs such as     
 Kidderminster District Angling Assoc- 
 iation, Bewdley A A, White Swan A A,  
 half being privately owned.KDAA charge
 Â£7.50 per year (no day tickets) for   
 June 16 to March 16.Competitions, open
 to anyone, are held each Wednesday and
 some weekends.                        
      Bewdley Rowing Club and canoeists
 from local towns use this stretch of  
 river; raft races, usually charity    
 events, pass by.In Summer the water is
 shallow but can rise 10-15ft in       
 Winter. The proposed Severn Navigation
 Scheme, opposed by conservationists   
 and fishermen,would widen parts of the
 river and allow motor boats upstream. </content>
