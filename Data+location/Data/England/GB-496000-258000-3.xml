		<content>{Sharnbrook Parish Council}was formed  
 in 1894.                              
 At present the Parish Council is made 
 up of 13 councillors elected by the   
 village. A clerk deals with           
 correspondence and minutes. The       
 Council is responsible for street     
 lighting, roadside grass cutting,     
 footpaths and bridleways, allotments, 
 and reporting on the state of the     
 roads to the{County Surveyor.         
 The Parish Council receives details of
 all{building projects}in the village, 
 considers them, and passes comments to
 the{Borough Planning Department,      
 which makes the final decision.       
 The{precept,}received each year, is   
 used for local projects including     
 tree planting, provision of seating   
 and litter bins and the payment of    
 grants to support local interest      
 groups.                               </content>
