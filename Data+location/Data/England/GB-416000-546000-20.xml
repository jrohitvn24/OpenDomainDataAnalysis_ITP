 There are 80 hounds kept by the hunt  
 from which the huntsman selects 29 per
 meet.Hounds are always counted in     
 couples.The hounds are kept in big    
 kennels called lodges which are owned 
 by the hunt at Whittonstall,near      
 Ebchester.They are walked out every   
 day by the kennel huntsman and his    
 staff who teach them to stay together 
 and  not stray.                       
  During the hunt the hounds chase the 
 fox encouraged by the huntsman's      
 horn.The people on horse back         
 gallop after the hounds over fields   
 and fences. Last season 30 foxes were 
 caught in this way.                   
                                       
 We have enjoyed our work for the      
 Domesday Project and look forward to  
 seeing the videodisc.
