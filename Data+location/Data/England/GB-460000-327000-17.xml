		<content> At the beginning of the 20th century  
 Widmerpool was a "typical" village    
 with a close community spirit. There  
 was the large Hall with its estate    
 providing employment, the Church,     
 about 12 farms, village industries, a 
 school, a shop and a range of social  
 classes with housing which varied     
 accordingly. During the last 30 years 
 Widmerpool has become a wealthy       
 "commuter" village. The Hall was sold 
 to the A.A., so the old ties between  
 the Hall family and the villagers were
 broken.  The farms have become larger 
 but far fewer in number. The most     
 striking difference is in the housing,
 which is now very middle class owner  
 occupied. The older village families  
 have declined and the influx of new   
 people who have either retired to or  
 want a home in the country has been   
 detrimental to community life.        </content>
