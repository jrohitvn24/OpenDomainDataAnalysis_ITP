		<title>19BRITISH RAIL, THATCHAM.</title>
		<content>  Thatcham station was built           
 in the 1840s. In 1940 The station had 
 a full staff of 23 and some 120       
 trains passed through each day of     
 which number a dozen in each direction
 were stopping trains.                 
 In early 1965, Thatcham became        
 an un-manned station. After the       
 withdrawal of Thatcham's  station     
 staff, fares were collected by        
 guards on 'paytrains'. In November    
 1965 the station buildings at Thatcham
 were demolished along with the        
 footbridge (erected in 1908). In      
 1967 level crossing barriers replaced 
 the old gates. In 1978 the signal box 
 was demolished when automatic         
 signalling was installed on the line. 
 Long queues of cars and lorries now   
 form either side of the level crossing
 when the barriers are down waiting for
 the trains to pass through.           </content>
