		<content> A Saxon font stands in the church     
 A pelican looks down from her perch,  
 Light shines in from the windows tall,
 Morwenna's fresco is on the wall,     
 Stained glass tells of days gone by   
 As we sit and worship God most high   
               {David Cleave    aged 11
                                       
 Our school is built of local stone    
 With slates from Delabole             
 Our school is built on top of a hill  
 And is very very old                  
 The roof is steep, the walls are white
 With wooden window frames,            
 And round our school are grassy fields
 And steeply sided lanes.              
               {Petra Frreman   aged 10
                                       
 Our school was built in the form of a 
 cross,For Reverend Hawker was the boss
