		<title>05THE WATER TOWER</title>
		<content>   As you drive up the road to Down St 
 Mary from Morchard Road you pass a    
 stone water tower.This is the second }
 tower to have been built on this site.
 The first fell down in the First World
 War and had to be rebuilt. They sank a
 well underneath the tower 200ft deep. 
 They also built a pump house which had
 a petrol engine to bring up the water 
 to the huge tower. It was used to     
 provide water for two villages, Down  
 St Mary and Morchard Road. It was     
 closed down in 1960 because it        
 couldn't serve both villages.
