		<title>13ACTIVITIES BY THE GRIMMER</title>
		<content>                                       
     The Grimmer is on the village     
green in Wickham Skeith.  It is a large
pond. It is a favourite place for      
children to play, adults like to fish  
at the waterside.                      
     We  enjoy games of rounders. Boys 
and girls play. There are six or seven 
of us aged from 8 to 19. We use a      
tennis ball and a baseball bat.        
Sometimes we play non stop cricket     
instead.                               
     The Grimmathon is a special long  
distance race,a bit like a marathon    
only much shorter . You have to run    
three times around the grimmer.        
     If you want to go in for the raft 
race you have to make your own raft    
first, then you have to row it across  
the Grimmer.
