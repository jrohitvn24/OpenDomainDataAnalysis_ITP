The large areas of marsh land lying to 
the north of the village were once     
covered by a tidal sea &amp; Cliffe was    
actually situated at the sea.Hence its 
early association as a port of some    
note &amp; its survival in the form of     
street names,e.g.Wharf Lane.But by the 
mid-(13th much of the area had altered 
as a result of changes in the course of
the Thames &amp; Medway &amp; the marshes had  
become permanently reclaimed.Modern    
alterations have been the removal of   
large amounts of sand and gravel for   
the building industry and the          
subsequent flooding of the pits. the   
area is now a patchwork of marshes,    
ditches and flooded pits.
