		<content> Harden Quarry at Biddlestone produces 
 a hard red volcanic stone (Andesite?).
  It is known to have been used at     
 Buckingham Palace on the drive.Some of
 the stone is exported mainy to        
 Holland. Here it is used for the cycle
 tracks to make them a different colour
 from the main roadways. The stone is  
 exported out of Berwick Harbour and   
 many wagons are used at these         
 times.Wagons come from all over the   
 United Kingdom including Northern     
 Island.                               
   None of the employees are from this 
 area.Most live in Rothbury.It is owned
 at present by Tilcon which is based in
 Yorkshire.The Quarry is expanding at  
 present.
