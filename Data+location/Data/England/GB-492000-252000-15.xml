		<title>15Turvey Heritage</title>
		<content> Anew organisation was formed in 1980  
 which aims topreserve the relics of   
 the past together with a record of    
 changes presently taking place in     
 order to leave a complete account of  
 village life for posterity. In doing  
 so, it hopes to act as a pressure     
 group to ensure that Turvey in the    
 future is as it's inhabitants wish it 
 to be. Turvey Heritage has restored   
 the Parish Bier and is collecting     
 together interesting items to form a  
 village museum. Some items have       
 already been on display in celebrating
 the Church's millenium and concerts   
 and lace exhibitions have been held to
 raise funds for the Group's           
 activities.
