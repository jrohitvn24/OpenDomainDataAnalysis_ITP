		<content> The block is made up of rural,        
 residential and industrial areas.A lot
 of it shows the outskirts of Kirkby   
 to the north.It is outside of the main
 town centre and, therefore, it is     
 lacking in amenities. Never the less, 
 the town centre is only short walking 
 distance for most people and those who
 live further away are generally served
 by good bus services. In the rural    
 areas the land tends to be mainly     
 cultivated and shared by some         
 seventeen farms. There is very little 
 cattle or sheep farming. Most of the  
 housing is modern since Kirkby is very
 much a modern town, though there are  
 some lovely old cottages that show    
 what Kirkby must have been like before
 the 1950's.
