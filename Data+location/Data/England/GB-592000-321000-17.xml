		<content>   On Sunday we got up and milked the  
 goat, after that I had to muck out    
 the goat shed.Then we went to Holkham 
 beach with my friend.We had lunch     
 there and when we came home we dropped
 my friend off at his house. Then we   
 went to our home and then we had      
 dinner. After dinner we watched       
 television and we played a game of    
 Monopoly. After that it was my bed    
 time.
