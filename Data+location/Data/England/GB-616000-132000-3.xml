		<title>03The Venetian Fete</title>
		<content>{   The Venetian Fete}is held on the   
{Royal Military Canal}at Hythe every   
 two years. It is like a carnival on   
 water and instead of lorries decorated
 boats are used or sometimes boats tow 
 a float.                              
                                       
    The Mayor of Hythe and the Hythe   
 Town Band sit on a platform which juts
 out into the water. The Mayor opens it
 with a speech and the band plays as   
 the boats and floats travel past up   
 the canal. On the opposite bank the   
 public sit and watch. The procession  
 goes up and down the canal in daylight
 and then up and down again torchlit in
 the dark.                             
                                       
    After the procession is over there 
 is a firework display and it all ends 
 about ten o'clock or ten thirty.
