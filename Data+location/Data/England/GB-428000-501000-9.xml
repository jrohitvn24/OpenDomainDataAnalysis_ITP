		<content> Sport is important in the villages.   
 North Cowton has a junior football    
 team which has achieved success in the
 Richmondshire District Junior League. 
 Cowton Football Team comprises of men 
 from both villages. Until recently it 
 played on a rough field on the out-   
 skirts of E Cowton, but now uses a    
 newly made pitch on N Cowton playing  
 field. East Cowton Cricket Club draws 
 players from both villages. It is in  
 the B Division of the Darlington      
 League and has a good field in the    
 centre of E Cowton. With help from a  
 100 Club it has had a new pavilion    
 built in recent years. In E Cowton    
 there is a Tennis Club, which uses a  
 hard court built by a local farmer.   
 N Cowton hopes to build a court next  
 year. It will cost Â£7400. Grants have 
 been received from the Sports Council 
 and the Parish Councils.              </content>
