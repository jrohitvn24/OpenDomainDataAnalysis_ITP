 **  Description of Our Area  **       
                                       
 The river{Esk}flows through this area 
 which is wooded with small farms.     
   Some of the farms are rented and    
 either belong to the Lord of the Manor
 or to the Normanby Estate.            
   The 3 villages are very small.      
{Grosmont}being a little larger than   
{Egton}and{Egton Bridge}as it was once 
 an iron_mining village.               
   This area is served by the Esk      
 Valley Railway line and the children  
 who attend Secondary School in Whitby 
 travel by it.                         
   A Mobile Bank visits Egton twice a  
 week for half an hour and Grosmont on 
 another day.The Library van comes     
 fortnightly to outlying farms and the 
 villages.The baker,greengrocer and    
 fish and chip vans visit us weekly.   </content>
