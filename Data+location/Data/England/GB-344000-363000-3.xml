		<title>03HOME FOR A CHRISTLETON GIRL</title>
		<content> I live with my family in a large house
 in Christleton.My favourite room is   
 our dining room,a real family room    
 with our musical instruments in it.We 
 have six recorders,flute,guitar,a     
 violin and piano,which Charlotte ,my  
 sister and I play.The nice thing      
 about our house is the space.The hall 
 is gigantic and all the rooms are     
 big.In the front garden we have a pond
 overgrown with rushes and reeds.      
 However it has an interesting variety 
 of wildlife.There are goldfish,       
 Palmate and common newts,frogs and    
 toads and many other creatures        
 including, pond skaters,water boatmen,
 great diving beetles,and water        
 scorpions. I am very interested in    
 Natural History and carry out my own  
 research and investigations.I also    
 belong to the School Wildlife Club and
 our Village Pond Conservation team.   </content>
