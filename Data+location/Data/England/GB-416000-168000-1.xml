 Marlborough is a small country town on
 the main London-Bath (A4) road,       
 serving a mainly agricultural economy 
 in the surrounding area. It is a      
 favoured stopping place for           
 travellers, with many hotels and      
 restaurants, together with a rich     
 variety of shops. Within the town are 
 several small scale industries,       
 producing highly specialised goods,   
 from puppets to leathercraft. New     
 housing developments are becoming     
 popular with workers in fast-growing  
 Swindon.
