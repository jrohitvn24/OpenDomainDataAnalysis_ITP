		<content> Employment in the Coxheath area is as 
 varied as one might expect in this    
 part of the world.  There is          
 relatively little unemployment and    
 much casual work on the many farms in 
 the district.  There is no single     
 large employer within the area.       
                                       
                                       
 A survey within Coxheath Junior School
 revealed that of all working parents  
 of children at the school:            
                                       
{17% }worked in {Coxheath}             
{31% }worked in {Maidtone              
{34%} worked in {the local area        
{11% }worked in {London                
{ 7% }worked   { further afield}       
                                       
 Most jobs are in the service sector   
 with very few people involved in      
 manufacturing.                        </content>
