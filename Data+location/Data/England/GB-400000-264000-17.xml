		<title>1710 YEARS OF CHANGE REDDITCH</title>
		<content> We found a map of{Headless Cross}of 10
 years ago,and the first thing that was
 immediately apparent,were the dramatic
 changes that had taken place.         
 Because of the {New Town}expansion of{
{Redditch,}this area like most others  
 around here have been developed.From  
 the map most of the open farmland and 
 grassland has been replaced with      
 residential areas.Although part of the
 area has been turned into parkland.   
 The network of roads and highways     
 built recently to link the new housing
 estates looks very different on the   
 map than the old streets.             
 The eastern part of our section has   
 been residential for a long time,and  
 the difference between the old and new
 areas makes for a very interesting    
 study.
