		<title>07LEISURE IN LANGPORT</title>
		<content>   We are 7 and 8 years old and we     
 asked our class to find out what their
 mums and dads did in Langport in their
 spare time. We found out that some of 
 them went to Clubs each week or       
 belonged to a team, while some went   
 out on their own.                     
   Here is a list of the activities.   
    Women's Institute; angling; tennis,
 badminton, football, cricket;         
 snooker;  gardening; rambling;        
 popmobility; tap dancing, ballroom    
 dancing; eating out; going to a pub   
 for a drink, a meal, to play darts,   
 skittles or pool; attending evening   
 classes at the Comprehensive School to
 learn new skills, for pleasure or to  
 improve their education with classes  
 linked to exams.                      
  Many adults are happy to stay at     
 home with their families and do not   
 use the facilities in the town.       </content>
