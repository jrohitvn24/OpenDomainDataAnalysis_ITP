		<title>08TROON Cornwall - Community</title>
		<content> TROON, like so many other towns and   
 villages has its problem of vandalism,
 but there is not much sign of it due  
 to good community policing by a local 
 policeman who patrols his beat on a   
 bicycle and is well known.            
 As the village has a growing number of
 elderly people it has a good community
 caring team of home helps, welfare    
 groups and nursing care.  There is    
 also a mobile library to assist those 
 who are unable to get to the main     
 library in Camborne, two and half Km  
 away.
