		<content> They  seem to  happen every  month. My
mum sees the adverts in  the local shop
windows. They  look  more  like  jumble
sales to me but dad says that sometimes
you  can get a bargain there. They have
them  in  the community centre or at my
brother's school.                      
 I  think that  they try  to get you to
buy  things  that  other  people  throw
away. You  even  have to pay just to go
in.  There are usually  about 20 stalls
where  the  sellers  sit  behind   long
tables.  On the  tables  are  the items
which they are hoping to sell.         
 Old stamps,  foreign coins,  cigarette
cards,  jewellry,  painted  plates, old
books and  maps: would  you want to pay
money for something  that  was not even
new when you bought it?                
 I wouldn't. But my dad did. He bought 
one book end to stop his old books from
falling over.                          </content>
