		<content> Coddiford  Farm, mentioned in the     
 original Domesday book, is now farmed 
 by Mr Ray Sanders. He has owned this  
 220 acre farm for 35 years. Mr Sanders
 and his two sons work the farm, not   
 forgetting  his faithful dog who helps
 by rounding up the cows. When he first
 bought the farm all the work was done 
 by horses. Now it is done with six    
 tractors. The fields are larger than  
 they were as several  hedges have been
 dug up to make it easier to use modern
 machines.                             
 Ray Sanders has 102{milking cows}and  
 gets from 2 to 8 gallons a day from   
 each cow. The cows are milked at 6a.m.
 and 4 p.m.and the 350 gallons of milk 
 are collected each day by a tanker and
 taken to a factory to be made into    
 cheese.
