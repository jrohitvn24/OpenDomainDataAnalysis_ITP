		<title>20AERIAL VIEW</title>
		<content>   In one of our courses at school it  
 was arranged that we could go up in a 
 small aeroplane and survey the        
 countryside around Gatesgill, taking  
 photographs and making a video        
 recording of what we saw.             
   Flying over the area was a lovely   
 experience: the fields below were like
 a patchwork of greens and browns.     
 Leading across the fields were faint  
 tracks made by the constant tread of a
 busy farming community.               
   Sparsely spread across this land are
 smallholdings with their dark slate   
 roofs, where people may farm as little
 as ten acres or as much as a thousand 
 acres.                                
   At this time of year (June) the     
 fields are lined with rows of cut     
 grass wilting ready to make silage. In
 other fields winter barley turns from 
 flush green to ripening golden brown. </content>
