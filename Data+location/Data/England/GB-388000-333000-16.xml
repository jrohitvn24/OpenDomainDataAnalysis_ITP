		<title>16Buildings in the Stone Area</title>
		<content> Reference has already been made to    
churches in Oulton and Stone.Outside   
the East window of Stone St. Michael's 
Church is a mausolum where the Earl of 
St. Vincent, a colleague of Nelson, is 
buried.                                
 The earl was born at Meaford Hall to  
the N.W. of Stone.This building has an 
18th C. shell-hood doorway, a          
French-style dormer and a garden front 
enriched by strapwork.                 
 There are some 18th C. houses and the 
Crown Hotel in Stone High Street.On    
the same side of the street is an      
elegant Tuscan-columned porch which    
has been blended into the frontage of  
a new supermarket.                     
 The oldest feature of the area is     
the Iron Age hill fort to the north of 
Stone at Bury Bank by the A.34 road.
