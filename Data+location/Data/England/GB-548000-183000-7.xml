		<title>07A 7-YR-OLD'S DAY IN DAGENHAM</title>
		<content>   In the morning my brother David     
 wakes me up and say's,"Can I play with
 your hoola hoop game, Laura?" So I    
 say,"Yes, but we'll take it into your 
 bedroom."  A hoola hoop game is where 
 you have five hoops and you throw them
 at five hooks.  We both have four goes
 then mummy comes and we go downstairs.
   For my breakfast have cocoa pops.   
 They are a crispy cereal with         
 chocolate on and you put milk on them.
 My mum reads the newspaper, while I   
 get washed. Ialso clean my teeth wiyh 
 toothpaste. I get dressed and my mum  
 walks me to school.                   
   When I get to school the teacher    
 calls the register. She calls all our 
 names and when we answer she marks us 
 in.                                   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
