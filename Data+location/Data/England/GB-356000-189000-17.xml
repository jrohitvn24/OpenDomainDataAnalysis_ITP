		<title>17Social Life-Aust, Littleton</title>
		<content> Social life in the two villages is    
 limited. Activities tend to centre on 
 the two public houses:the Boar's Head 
 at Aust and the White Hart at         
 Littleton. The White Hart has a       
 skittle alley and some of the         
 villagers belong to the skittle club. 
 One farmer we spoke to in Aust said he
 had a boy aged nineteen and a girl    
 aged seventeen who had often found it 
 boring living so far away from        
 entertainment. However now his son was
 older he was able to go to Bristol on 
 his own and had joined the Young      
 Farmer's Club which met at Elberton,  
 about a mile away.                    
 On the day we visited Aust, Trotting  
 Races were being advertised at Cote   
 Farm.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
