  {Swadlincote test site}is part of the
{N.C.B. Mining Research &amp; Development  
{Establishment.}It was opened in 1956  
 to carry out surface testing of mining
 machinery. The site covers{80 acres}&amp; 
 approximately{120 people}are employed 
 there.In 1981 a large complex of test 
 houses was opened to allow most       
 machinery to be tested inside. Tests  
 are usually carried out before the    
 machinery is used in any one of the   
 present coal mines in Great Britain.  
 Machines are often tested to          
 destruction. This is done on purpose  
 to find out how much a machine can    
 take before it breaks down.
