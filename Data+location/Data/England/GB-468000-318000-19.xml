		<content> My Mum is usually up first during the 
 week, but not on Saturdays or Sundays.
 When she gets up she goes into the    
 bathroom, has her wash and gets       
 dressed.Then she goes downstairs and  
 on Sundays  starts to get the Sunday  
 dinner ready.While it is cooking she  
 gets out the hoover (vacuum cleaner)  
 and starts hoovering the carpets.When 
 she has done that she gets the polish 
 and duster out and starts to polish   
 the furniture.When she has done that  
 she goes to feed the fish in the fish 
 tank. She feeds the fish on fish food 
 called "Aquarium".Then she sits down  
 and watches the television. When her  
 programme has finished she goes and   
 turns off the dinner and she starts to
 dish it out. She then goes into the   
 front room and eats it with us. When  
 she has eaten her Sunday dinner she   
 goes into the kitchen and washes up.  </content>
