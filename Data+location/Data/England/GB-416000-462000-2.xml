		<content> The most striking example is          
 Glasshouses, with Smelthouses, New    
 York and Low Laithe, although none of 
 the mills is still used for its       
 original purpose - the watercourses   
 are still visible, however.           
 On Guisecliffe and at various other   
 points are the remains of the         
 quarrying industry which provided     
 good building stone up to the First   
 World War.                            
 The housing is now almost all         
 privately owned with some modern      
 development, particularly in          
 Glasshouses.  Nearly all houses       
 are built of the local millstone      
 grit with flagstone roofs on the older
 buildings and blue slate on the more  
 modern.
