		<content> Most enticing to{Mrs. Hart}was the    
 hot,sticky{Chelsea bun}from Packe's   
 the baker's shop{(Packey Doughnuts)   
 obtained from a passageway at the rear
{(Chelsea Lane).                       
   There was a great variety of shops  
 including a large{Co_operative Store  
 with{drapery,grocery}and{furniture    
 departments.One of the most           
{fascinating sights}was the system of  
{giving change,}using a complicated    
 network of overhead rails with        
 cylinder containers for change which  
 were shot and returned like{missiles. 
   Local people were interesting       
 too.One was{Percy Bartlett}who drove  
 a{horse and cart,}carrying a          
{foul_smelling,moving grey mass}which  
 was{rotting sheepskin from Morlands.  
 For what purpose was unknown but      
{'jellies'}was the childrens           
 suggestion.                           </content>
