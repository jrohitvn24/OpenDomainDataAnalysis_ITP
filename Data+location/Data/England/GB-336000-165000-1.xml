		<title>01PLAIN OF THE CONGRESBURY YEO</title>
		<content>  The parishes of WIck St.Lawrence and 
 Kingston Seymour, which are part of   
 the Woodspring District of the County 
 of Avon, are separated by the         
 Congresbury Yeo river which flows from
 the south west to the Bristol Channel.
 The whole area is in places below sea 
 level,flat and given over to farming. 
 As the Congresbury Yeo cannot be      
 crossed for a considerable way inland 
 there is no contact between the two   
 villages although in character they   
 are very  similar.                    
 Wick St. Lawrence has a population of 
 200 and is reached from the main      
 Bristol to Weston Super Mare road     
 at Hewish.It is about two miles from  
 Weston Super Mare as the crow flies   
 but much further by road.             
 Kingston Seymour is three miles from  
 Clevedon and is just off the Clevedon 
 to Yatton road.The population is 360 .</content>
