		<content>  We are a group of fifteen children   
 from Horncliffe County First School.  
 Our school is in Horncliffe  Village  
 and the children come to school from  
 within the area allocated to us which 
 lies in Northumberland County.        
  Our village is situated on the edge  
 of the border between England and     
 Scotland and our block lies astride   
 the border which is the River Tweed.  
   Horncliffe is about five miles up-  
 stream from the mouth of the river    
 where the town of Berwick-upon-Tweed  
 is situated.                          
   The River Tweed is famous for its   
 salmon and there are several fisheries
 close to the village.                 
    Most of the block is agricultural  
 land both arable and pasture with some
 wooded areas.The main employment is   
 agriculture and fishing on the river  
 for salmon either netting or angling. </content>
