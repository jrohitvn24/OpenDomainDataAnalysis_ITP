		<title>16CROFT GUIDES &amp; BROWNIES.</title>
		<content>   Croft Brownies meet at Croft School 
 at 6.00 p.m. every Thursday during    
 school term time. We are called the   
 1st. Croft Brownies and our meetings  
 last for an hour.                     
   There are twelve of us and we are   
 divided into two groups which are     
 called the elves and the sprites. Our 
 leaders are called  Brown Owl and     
 Tawny Owl, and every year we have our 
 Brownie Birthday, when we put an extra
 candle on the cake each time. We work 
 at lots of different badges.          
   The Guides meet at Croft School on  
 Thursday nights after the Brownies'   
 meeting is finished, from 7.30 p.m.   
 until 9.00 p.m. There are nine Guides 
 divided into two patrols _Swallows and
 Kingfishers. Each year the Guides go  
 to camp. They have to raise money to  
 be self-supporting and try to help the
 community.                            </content>
