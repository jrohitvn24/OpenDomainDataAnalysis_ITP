		<title>01Egton High Moor</title>
		<content> Most of the area is high heather      
 dominated moorland although a lower   
 area is farmed in the depression f    
 Bitter Beek and also were the moors   
 drop sharply into Glaisdale in the    
 north west.  the valley sides have    
 quite extensive commercial softwood   
 plantations before giving way to      
 predominantly sheep and cattle grazing
 in the valleys. There are fairly      
 extensive hardwood areas along Butter 
 Beck. The residents are farmers and   
 there are only a very few farms in    
 this block. The moors are used for    
 sheep grazing and grouse shooting.    
 Roads do traverse the block and so the
 area is visited by tourists as well as
 walkers. The block is in a National   
 Park and has spectacular views over   
 the surroundng moors and valleys.
