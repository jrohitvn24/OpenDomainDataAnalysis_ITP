		<title>03Housing in Freshfield</title>
		<content> Tower Grange, built in 1350 in Grange 
 Lane, was the oldest house found in   
 our survey. Restored in 1908, it is   
 reputed to have the ghost of a priest,
 who died in a priest hole, possibly in
 Elizabethan times. The present price  
 of building land is Â£28 per square    
 metre. The average cost of a house    
 currently available for purchase, is  
 Â£54,000. Most of the housing consists 
 of expensive owner-occupied detached  
 or semi-detached properties, with a   
 good proportion of bungalows. Many and
 varied building materials have been   
 used in the area. The reigns of       
 Victoria and George V saw notable     
 growth in Freshfield but the largest  
 expansion in building has been between
 1953 and the present day.
