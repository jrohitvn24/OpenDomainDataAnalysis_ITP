		<content> Road is the only way to Poringland.The
 B1332 is the main road.Its very busy  
 and dangerous.In recent years 3 have  
 died and 4 seriously injured.There is 
 a good bus service to Norwich.There   
 are 4 garages with petrol priced at   
 Â£2.05 per gallon.Even with so many    
 local cars trade is poor no coaches or
 cars are hired but 2 driving schools  
 are based here.Even though Framingham 
 Earl has a Railway Tavern, no railway 
 has ever been there do to Colmans of  
 Norwich not selling  the land needed.
