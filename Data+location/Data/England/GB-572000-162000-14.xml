		<title>14ROCHESTER AIRPORT</title>
		<content> The Airport buildings are owned by    
 G.E.C. Avionics and the land by       
 Rochester_Upon_Medway Council. Only   
{small aircraft}use the airport but  We
 thought it would be like Heathrow with
 large airliners and suitcases         
 everywhere.If an aircraft comes from  
{abroad}it has to land first at a      
 bigger airport with customs officials.
 There were a lot of{old aircraft}being
 renovated.We saw a bi-plane which was 
 a Tiger Moth,which looked like new.We 
 also saw a Mirage and a Hurricane.    
 The{control tower}was interesting,we  
 all jumped,when the pilots radioed in 
 because it was so loud.There is a     
{signal square}for pilots without radio
 it tells them with arrows and other   
 signs what the landing conditions are.
 There is a{landing fee }of Â£4 for     
 planes with one engine and Â£10 for    
 those with two.                       </content>
