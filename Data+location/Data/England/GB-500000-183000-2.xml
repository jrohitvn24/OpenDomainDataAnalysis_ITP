		<title>02IVER HEATH SCHOOLS 1958-85</title>
		<content>   In 1958 plans were being made for a 
 new primary school in the Heathway    
 estate,and it was here that the first 
 three Infant classrooms and the       
 administrative block were ready on    
 January 28 1963.More buildings were to
 follow in 1968 and in 1972-73,by which
 time there would be 436 children on   
 the roll,but with fresh reorganisation
 in 1973 and the consequent use of the 
 new building as a Middle school,a site
 in Slough Road would have a new lease 
 of life as the home of the First      
 school.                               
 In 1985 Iver Heath Middle school has  
 82 boys,86 girls,a total of 168 pupils
 aged between 8 and 12.The school has  
 its own swimming, netball, athletics, 
 football teams.
