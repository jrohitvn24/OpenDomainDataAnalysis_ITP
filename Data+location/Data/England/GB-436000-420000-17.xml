 Kirkthorpe lane. There are about one  
 hundred and fifty houses on our

 shop, the shop sells almost everything
 from sweets to fishing nets. Across   
  from the shop there is  acommunity   
  centre with  a field at the side.    
 Centred around Kirkthorpe church are  
 many converted farm buildings which   
  have made atractive stone dwellings.
