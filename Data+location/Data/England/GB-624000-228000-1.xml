		<title>01Dovercourt - Holiday Resort</title>
		<content>{Dovercourt has long stretches of      
{clean,golden sands and safe water.}It 
 is free of the more obvious           
 commercialism but has many attractions
 especially for children. There is a   
 boating lake,a model yacht pond,a     
 small amusement arcade,a              
 roller-skating rink, putting green and
 tennis courts.A new indoor swimming   
 pool opened in 1984. There is a golf  
 course and sailing clubs.             
   There are plenty of safe places for 
 games and space to stroll and enjoy   
 the view. From almost any point on the
 peninsula you can see a wide range of 
 sea-going craft: fishing              
 boats,yachts,trawlers,tug boats,      
 Trinity House launches: sometimes     
 old Thames sailing barges and always  
 the impressive continental ferries.
