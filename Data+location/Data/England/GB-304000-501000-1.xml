		<content>  Our villages lie between the         
 mountains and the sea. For thousands  
 of years this area remained remote &amp;  
 unchanged. The names show them to have
 been settled since Viking times, but  
 the first change came with the        
 arrival of the{railway}in 1847.Then in
 1950 the atomic Power station at      
 Sellafield began to{employ }more      
 people.So from being an entirely {    
{farming }area it has become an        
 industrial area, although the {Power  
{Station }is tucked out of sight.The { 
{houses }in both villages reflect this 
 change, being a mixture of Victorian  
 and present-day styles, the latter    
 being grouped in estates.Both villages
 are self-sufficient in{shops}&amp;{       
{entertainment,}although {transport}by 
 car is universal,so people are used to
 going elsewhere to find what they     
 want.                                 </content>
