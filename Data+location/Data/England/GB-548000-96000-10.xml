		<title>10Day in The Life(cont.)</title>
		<content> Morning at work consists of 2 hours   
 appointed surgery,mail,patient and    
 administrative correspondence followed
 by house calls.Visits to local Nursing
 Homes,and a school for whom I'm       
 Medical Officer,meetings with the     
 district nurses and midwife,and       
 attendance at Case Conferences with   
 social worker also take up a variable 
 amount of time during this period.    
     I try to stop for lunch at about  
 1.30.This is sometimes interupted by  
 'phone calls.If not I may also take   
 the chance of a short sleep following 
 a busy night on duty.                 
     My wife may have visited the shops
 ,attended a committee meeting,or      
 tidied the childrens roomsfor the 10th
 time in the week during the morning   
 but manages to remain in control of   
 lunch,and has also written letters and
 paid the bills.                       </content>
