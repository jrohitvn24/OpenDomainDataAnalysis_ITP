		<title>06Wild Flowers</title>
		<content>There were a lot of wild flowers on our
walk from the Jackdaw Garage to        
Ixworth Thorpe.                        
                                       
We saw poppies, daisies, buttercups,   
wild roses, and umbrella plants. The   
poppies had hairy stalks and a bright  
red flower that looked very pretty in  
the corners of the fields. The daisies 
were smaller and had white petals with 
a yellow middle. The umbrella-plants   
were often very tall, some were as     
high as 2 metres, while some were only 
half a metre.                          
                                       
The walk is one of the prettiest in the
area and is a good example of an old   
road as it might have looked before    
horses and carts became numerous!      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
