		<title>17POPULATION IN NE LEICS</title>
		<content> The vast majority of the population of
 the Marefield/Lowesby area comprise   
 the 18-65 age group (i.e. working     
 population) and their children.The    
 older people prefer to move out to    
 villages where health and shopping    
 facilities are available.             
  Most families have been in the area  
 for many years giving a mainly static 
 population. A recent trend has been   
 for professional families, often      
 working in Leicester, to buy          
 smallholdings to enjoy the rural way  
 of life.                              
  The area is staunchly Conservative.  
 Most families are content with their  
 way of life expressing a sense of     
 security and safety here and having no
 desire to live elsewhere. Thet        
 consider the services provided by the 
 Local Authority to be quite adequate  
 in view of their remote position.     </content>
