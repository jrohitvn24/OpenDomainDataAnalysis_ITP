		<content> The village once consisted of a few   
 large houses set in spacious grounds, 
 with humbler homes for the rural      
 working classes.Two major council     
 housing estates were built some thirty
 years ago,along with modest private   
 estates,either as ribbon development  
 along the main roads,or along smaller 
 roads into the Common.                
  Although normal for a builder to fill
 small gaps of land with the certainty 
 of a quick sale,this had not produced 
 any major change in the village's     
 appearance until the latest develop-  
 ments,which have dramatically extended
 the urban environment.This increased  
 pressure on the limited amenities.    
  Planning decisions can be contrever- 
 sial,and the village now waits to see 
 if the former WRNS camp on Clayhill   
 Road will become an American enclave.
