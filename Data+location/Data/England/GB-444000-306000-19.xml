 during June 1985.Our findings were    
 interesting.We interviewed 72         
 households out of a total of 773 in   
 the village approx. 10% of the total. 
 We asked what facilities would you    
 like to see in Thornton. Gas 1,       
 chemist/Doctor 25 ,guides 1, free     
 church 1, sports  facilities 15, shops
 9,buses 20, fish and chips 5.         
 people are most concerned about the   
 lack of health facilities and the poor
 bus services. We asked people what    
 they disliked about Thornton. Noisy   
 fast traffic 4  .Street parking 1  .  
 broken glass  1  .dog litter  6

 the shops a week every day 20,3 days
