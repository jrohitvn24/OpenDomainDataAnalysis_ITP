		<content> The amenities in the block are        
 sparse.At Buck's Mills village there  
 is a free carpark,a telephone kiosk   
 and a post box,but,although the beach 
 is popular there are no public        
 toilets.There is a small shop catering
 mostly for tourists,but it has some   
 goods for local consumption.This shop 
 was a small holding and a Temperance  
 hotel.A travelling library visits once
 a fortnight.A Parochial Church Room   
 built in 1928 serves as a village     
 hall.At West Bucks there is a local   
 builder who is also an                
 undertaker.There too is a family firm 
 of agricultural and building          
 contractors.The A39 lay-by at London  
 Lodge has a post box cleared twice    
 daily.
