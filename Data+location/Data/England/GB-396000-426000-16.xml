		<content> There are many{clubs, societies}and   
{locations}where young and old can     
 enjoy themselves.                     
 For the more energetic there are      
 putting, bowling and tennis           
 facilities, and a childrens' play area
 in the Calder Holmes Park. The{local  
{football team,}Red Star, play here    
 also.                                 
 The Birchcliffe Centre offers         
 accommodation and detailed information
 about the Pennine environment. It is  
 a{conference centre}also.             
 Children attend the several Brownie,  
 Guide, Cub and Scout groups as well as
 several Sunday Schools and Youth      
 Clubs. A relatively new organisation  
 for children is the{'Woodcraft Folk'  
 whose principles are peace and        
 cooperation. The group meets on a     
 weekly basis and the children take    
 part in creative activities.          </content>
