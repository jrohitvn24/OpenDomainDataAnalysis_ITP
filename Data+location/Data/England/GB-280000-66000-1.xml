		<content>  This area has been inhabited since   
{pre-Celtic}times.{Hedge counts}show   
 road and field patterns which dominate
 the landscape, to be very old. Small  
 woods and copses add to the patchwork 
 effect. Almost all the area is given  
 over to small independent{farms.      
{ Denbury, Ipplepen}and{Broadhempston  
 are separate, close-knit thriving     
 village communities providing homes   
 for commuters to the nearby towns and,
 for retired people, also the hamlet of
{Torbryan. New homes have been built}in
 Denbury and Ipplepen since 1960. Small
 growth is planned for Broadhempston,  
 none at Torbryan.There has been an    
 influx of people from all over        
 Britain. Only a small percentage of   
 each village is second or third       
 generation 'native'.
