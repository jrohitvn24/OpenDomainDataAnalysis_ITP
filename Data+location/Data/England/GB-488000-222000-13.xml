		<title>13Linslade-Places of Interest</title>
		<content>    There are many places of interest  
 in Linslade, most of them are the     
 churches. St.Barnabus is one of them. 
 It was built in the 19th Century and  
 is situated in New Linslade. The      
 development of the railway running    
 through Linslade made people move to  
 houses around that area and the church
 was built for them. St.Mary's Church  
 is situated in Old Linslade. It used  
 to be the parish church, but now it is
 just open to the public for worship on
 a few days each year. The church was  
 originally a Norman building and had  
 its tower rebuilt in the 15th century.
 It  has a stair turret and a wall     
 which was to protect it against       
 attack.                               
    Another place or interest is       
 Linslade tunnel where the railway runs
 through. When you look at it, it looks
 like a castle.                        </content>
