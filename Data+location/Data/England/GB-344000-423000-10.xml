		<title>10The Marsh and Brickcroft(2)</title>
		<content>  It is probable that a number of local
buildings were constructed from Longton
bricks.                                
  There were three pits dug at various 
times and a small railway was built    
between them. The kiln was built next  
to the railway so that the bricks could
be quickly taken to Preston.           
  The kiln was shaped like an aircraft 
hangar with a big chimney at one end.It
burnt coal.There were thousands of     
bricks fired at one time. Originally   
the openings of the kiln were packed   
with clay to keep the heat in but later
iron doors were fitted. The heat given 
off when the bricks were fired was     
over-powering.                         
  The Brickcroft closed in the mid-    
sixties along with the railway. Since  
then the area,now bleak and windswept, 
has been popular with shooting and     
fishing enthusiasts.(Graham Chadwick)  </content>
