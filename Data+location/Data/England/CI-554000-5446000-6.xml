		<title>06My family weekend</title>
		<content>   Saturday breakfast is casual - we   
 eat piles of toast and discuss our    
 programme for the day.  Today it is   
 fruit picking (Eleanor and I), piano  
 lesson (Ginny), painting a door (Tony)
 and a dinner party (Tony and I).      
 By 8 p.m. we have done everything     
 except the dinner party.  The children
 go to bed, our guests arrive, and     
 Saturday slips into Sunday without our
 realising it.                         
   9.15 a.m. on Sunday and we leave for
 church and Sunday school.  By 10.45 we
 are back, and Tony lights the         
 barbeque.  We eat lunch and later go  
 to Beauport for a swim.  The girls do 
 their homework reluctantly!           
   There's an American film or a Handel
 concert on the television.  Tony has  
 some paperwork to do and I phone the  
 parents (Sunday ritual).  By ll p.m.  
 we are in bed, the weekend is over.   </content>
