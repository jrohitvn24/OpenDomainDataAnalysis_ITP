		<content>{Arable Farming}is the main activity on
 the land in this area. The main crops 
 grown are wheat, barley, oats, rye and
 oil-seed-rape.Root crops such as      
 potato and sugar-beet are also        
 popular.Within the area the type of   
 soil varies considerably. In some     
 parts the soil is heavy and requires  
 draining;in other places it is light  
 and sandy.                            
{Mixed Farming}usually combines        
 livestock with growing crops for      
 feeding the cattle.One farm has       
 Fresian Cattle and grows silage, sugar
 beet (the beet tops being animal      
 fodder) and other arable crops.       
{Intensive farming}is carried out at   
 nurseries where many different plants 
 are grown under glass. Intensive      
 cultivation also includes salad       
 production and flowers.There are also 
 market gardens and small holdings.    </content>
