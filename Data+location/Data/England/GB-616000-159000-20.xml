		<content>After school activities are difficult  
to run because many children rely on   
private transport to get home. Sport   
events after school make it necessary  
to take players home in the mini-bus.  
In bad weather the coaches can not get 
thru' to the villages &amp; the school has 
to close.{2.FALLING ROLLS} The school  
opened with 180 pupils &amp; these numbers 
to 500 in the 1960s.In 1982, due to the
rapid expansion of surrounding villages
the roll rose to 818. The numbers are  
now falling &amp; there will be only 4 form
entry (usually 6), by 1990 the numbers 
are expected to drop to 550. When      
interviewed the Head thought this would
be an advantage since staff &amp; pupils   
can get to know each other better. The 
disadvantage is that staff will become 
redundant &amp; less govnmnt funds will be 
available for new buildings &amp;          
resources.                             </content>
