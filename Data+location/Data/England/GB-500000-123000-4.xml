		<title>04FARMING - PETWORTH RURAL NE</title>
		<content> Hens, mainly Rhode Island Reds, roam  
 freely around most of the farms, and  
 one farmer's wife tried selling her   
 eggs at Petworth Market, expecting a  
 good price for them as 'free range',  
 said to be better quality than those  
 battery produced. However, under the  
 European Economic Community           
 regulations her eggs were graded so   
 small the price did not cover the cost
 of transport, so she gave up. Except  
 for farms who produce their own milk, 
 it is delivered, mostly on alternate  
 days. Marshall's also provide their   
 own meat. Newspapers are not delivered
 to any farm or house, the cost would  
 be too high, but even in this remote  
 district the Post is brought daily,   
 and there are pillar boxes in some    
 areas. Lowfold Farm has its own box at
 the end of the lane.
