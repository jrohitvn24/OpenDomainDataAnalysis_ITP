		<title>15CAREWELL FRUIT FARM</title>
		<content> Carewell Fruit and Vegetable Farm is a
 Pick Your Own Centre in Lingfield. It 
 has many facilities including a large,
 drained car park and is open nearly   
 all the year round.                   
 The fruit for picking is available    
 from the end of June beginning with   
 strawberries and gooseberries, with   
 raspberries in early July,            
 redcurrants, blackcurrants and        
 loganberries mid July with cultivated 
 blackberries ending the season in     
 August.                               
  The vegetables offered for picking   
 vary from potatoes and carrots to the 
 more exotic courgettes and garlic.    
 Parents can leisurely spend their time
 picking for their freezers whilst     
 their children can play in the large  
 sandpit made available to them, as    
 well as the huge field with a  shady  
 tree ideal for picnicing beneath.     </content>
