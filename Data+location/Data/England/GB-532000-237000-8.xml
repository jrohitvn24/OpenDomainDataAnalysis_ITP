		<title>08MRS HODGE,THE FARMER.</title>
		<content> MRS.HODGE gets up at 6.30 a.m. and    
 starts work at 7.30.a.m.She has 4     
 sheep,2 ducks,8 horses,4 cats,1 dog,7 
 tractors and 1 combine. It is a hard  
 job to run a farm.She lives in a big  
 house,with 5 barns and 460 acres to   
 look after. There are 3 workers who   
 live in cottages at one side of the   
 farm to help Mrs.Hodge.To get to the  
 farm you go up a long drive with an   
 orchard on one side. There is a big   
 pond where the ducks live. Behind the 
 house there is a chalk pit where they 
 have a pigeon shoot. The chalk is not 
 used to make lime for the fields any  
 more but it is sometimes used to make 
 new farm tracks. Inside the house the 
 rooms are gi-normous. There was a very
 big table in the room we were in.There
 were bells for servants-but no        
 servants-and in the kitchen there was 
 a very big cooker.     BY SIMON       </content>
