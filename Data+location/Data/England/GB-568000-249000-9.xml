		<title>09"Wychem" Chemical Works</title>
		<content> Before this building  became a        
 chemical factory,it had been used by  
 the R.A.F.at different times as a     
 gymnasium,a chapel and a cinema,as it 
 is very close to the former airfield  
 of Stradishall.It is now owned by     
 Vickers as part of their              
 Howson-Algraphy division. Seventeen   
 men are employed here making chemicals
 as ordered by their customers.   They 
 make drugs for the Sterling Health    
 company as well as copying and        
 soldering chemicals.They make resin   
 which is believed to be used on the   
 nose-cones of space rockets.Rat poison
 precursor is also made here -this     
 replaces "Warfarin",the best-known    
 product at the moment.Strict safety   
 rules are enforced at all times and   
 there have been no serious accidents  
 to date.                              
                                       </content>
