		<content>    With the opening of the bypass in  
 1983 it was decided that something    
 should be done to change the village  
 and to try and make it more beautiful.
    A public meeting was called and a  
 committee formed to enter the village 
 in the{Britain in Bloom Competition}in
 1984. Everyone worked hard to dig     
 flower beds, plant trees,plants and   
 shrubs.Soon everyone in the village   
 was hard at work making their own     
 gardens tidy, ready for the judging.  
    The village really began to look   
 much better and by the time the judges
 arrived there were lots of flowers in 
 bloom.                                
    Everyone was delighted that the{Cup
 given by the{Newcastle Evening        
{Chronicle}for the most improved       
 village was won by Scremerston, the   
 only village in Berwick Borough to    
 enter the competition.                </content>
