 is remarkedly rich and varied.        
 Traditionally centred on CHURCH and   
 CHAPELS religious and social life is  
 wholly intermingled in spite of the   
 drop in religious services.Music has  
 always been part of life here,bringing
 many visiting choirs.Many exhibitions 
 are also held in places of worship.A  
 biblical test being used to illustrate
 art craft and floral arrangements.The 
 standard is high.Amongst older people 
 this way of life still.The 1970s      
 brought a number of"self sufficieners"
 The majority are still here,though no 
 longer in the "pure" form.men follow a
 career or are self employed in some   
 craft.Women keep goats,pigs and fowl  
 and grow vegatables.Most are members  
 of the community.                     </content>
