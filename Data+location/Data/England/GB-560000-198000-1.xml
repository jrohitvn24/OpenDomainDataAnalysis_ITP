		<content>   The area that we have been allocated
 is about 25 miles NE of London and is 
 mainly used for crop farming. It is   
 bounded by Fryerning, Blackmore,      
 Ingatestone and Mountnessing, but none
 of these villages is included to any  
 great extent and there are very few   
 items of real interest.               
   This has traditionally been a       
 farming area, but there has been a    
 change from animal to arable farming. 
 Some woods have gradually been        
 cleared to make way for more arable   
 land and many of the smaller farms    
 have been "swallowed up" so that there
 are now only two or three farming     
 families. There has never been much of
 a population and so the facilities are
 few, with public transport only       
 passing through the SE corner from    
 Brentwood to Chelmsford, along the old
 Roman road.                           </content>
