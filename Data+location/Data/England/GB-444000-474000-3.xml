		<content> Sessay is a peaceful village          
 surrounded by beautiful countryside   
 with the Hambleton Hills and the      
 famous White Horse of Kilburn in the  
 background.  It provides a relaxing   
 holiday base for the motorist and is  
 especially suitable for the cyclist or
 hiker as the land, being in the Vale  
 of York, is flat with only a few small
 hills.  Sessay is only a short        
 distance away from many picturesque   
 villages and market towns.            
                                       
                                       
 Accommodation is readily available in 
 the vicinity.  In Sessay itself there 
 is a five-van caravan site, with a    
 larger public site at Hutton Sessay.  
 Public Houses, providing substantial  
 bar meals, are found at Hutton Sessay 
 and Dalton.  There are children's     
 playgrounds at both these inns.       </content>
