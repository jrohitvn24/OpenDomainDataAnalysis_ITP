		<title>15A DAY IN MY LIFE PT 1</title>
		<content> When I get up in the morning which is 
 between half past six and seven       
 o'clock,I get dressed in my old       
 clothes and go outside to help milk   
 the cows.At a quarter to eight I go   
 into the house and have a wash and get
 ready for school,then I have my       
 breakfast,which is usually cornflakes 
 and milk.I then have another wash and 
 put my coat on and wait for the school
 taxi to pick me up.When the taxi comes
 I get on and it takes me to           
 school.When I get to school I put myt 
 coat on my peg and put any other      
 things in my desk.                    
 At nine o'clock Mr.Yeomans calls the  
 register and then we go into the hall 
 for assembly.After assembly we go back
 into the classroom and do maths until 
 half past ten, then it is playtime    
 until ten forty-five.We then do work  
 from our Sound Sense English books.   </content>
