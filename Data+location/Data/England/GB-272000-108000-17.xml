 The population of the village has been
 gradually increasing over the last    
 twenty years and particularly twelve  
 years ago.When a large{Private housing
{estate}was built.The population now   
 stands at about seven hundred and has 
 now stablized. Families are moving    
 into the village because the {property
{values}are lower than Exeter.Many     
 people move to Devon for their {work} 
 and live in Lapford.Devon is a popular
 place for {retirement}and there are   
 many retired people in the village who
 have moved from another part of the   
 country to Devon.Although many parents
 come from all over the country most   
 of their children were born in the    
 village .There are now more shops in  
 the village because of increased      
 population.
