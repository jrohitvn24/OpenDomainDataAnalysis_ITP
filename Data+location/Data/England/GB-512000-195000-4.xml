		<content> This farm which is located in squares 
 05140196, 05150196 and 05140197 has   
 been the property of the Hall family  
 since 1907. The farm was recovered    
 from tenants in 1982 and it now forms 
 50% of 300 acres farmed by Mr.Hall.   
 The farm is situated on Heavy London  
 clay and all but 5 acres is well      
 drained. 66% of the acreage is sown   
 with winter wheat, spring wheat,      
 barley and oilseed rape; 30% is sown  
 with grasses for hay. The latter finds
 a local market as some 2000 horses are
 kept within an 8 mile radius. Before  
 EEC changes in 1976 Hillfield Farm    
 stocked pigs but now a few beef cattle
 only are kept. The owner employs 1    
 full-time worker but seasonal labour  
 is taken on for the hay and corn      
 harvests. The density of population in
 the area make such farming practice as
 stubble burning imposssible.          </content>
