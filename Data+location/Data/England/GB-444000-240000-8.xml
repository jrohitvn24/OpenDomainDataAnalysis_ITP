		<title>08Annual Events in Banbury</title>
		<content>  The Carnival is held in June or July.
The big floats parade through Banbury. 
It starts at Castle Street Car Park,   
goes round to the Cross and back again.
Then there are amusements in the field 
behind Spiceball. This year there were 
helicopter rides.                      
  The pram race is around Easter. It   
starts in the market place and goes    
round the streets and back to the      
start.                                 
  On the Sunday nearest St. George's   
Day the cubs, scouts, brownies and     
guides all parade with different bands 
from Castle Street up High Street,     
round the cross to St. Mary's.         
  In October the fair comes for three  
nights and fills the bus station, the  
market place and the streets around.   
  Also there is a Mayor-making ceremony
at the town hall every Spring.
