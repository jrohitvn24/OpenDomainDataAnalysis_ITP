		<title>17FARMING IN L.STAUGHTON</title>
		<content> The soil type in this area is         
 predominantly chalky boulder clay,    
 with pockets of silts and gravel in   
 some of the lower lying areas. The    
 clay is impervious,and in most cases  
 the fields need a system of           
 underground drains with gravel placed 
 over them to allow the rain to        
 percolate through the ground.         
 This clay is ideally suited to the    
 growing of{winter cereals,}and indeed 
 winter wheat with some barley is by   
 far the most widespread crops grown.  
 Yields would be above the national    
 average and a good crop of winter     
 wheat could be expected  to yield     
 7.5tonnes/hectare,currently valued at 
 around 120pounds/ tonne,with barley   
 worth slightly less.
