		<content> Winnall Moors will be open to the     
 public on 11th August which is great  
 because it is all wild life. You can  
 see a lot of wild flowers and         
 wild birds which make a lovely noise  
 altogether.The River Itchen flows     
 through Winnall Moors. Winnall Moors  
 covers an area of 100 acres and 40    
 acres will be open to the public.The  
 northern part of Winnall Moors is     
 owned by Hampshire and Isle Of Wight  
 Naturalist Trust and the southern part
 is owned by Winchester City Council.  
 They have dug a pond for the creatures
 and insects which live in still water 
 because the River Itchen is fast      
 flowing .The Moors were once water    
 meadows.The animals they have         
 are foxes, otters, coots, moorhen,    
 snipe, water voles and redshank.Among 
 the plants  are Willow, Alder,        
 Hemlock, Ragged Robin and many more.  </content>
