		<content> Badgers were poisoned for they were   
 thought to carry a disease and pass it
 on to cattle.Quite a few badgers are  
 knocked down by cars and the          
 population is unfortunately small and 
 is not increasing.                    
                                       
  Foxes are at large in the countryside
 and are shot a lot because they are a 
 threat to lambs,ducks,geese,chickens  
 and sometimes on pheasant farms       
 pheasants are killed by the fox.Hunts 
 to kill the fox are set up but some   
 animal lovers spray lemon mixed with  
 garlic on fox runs to throw the hounds
 off the scent.Foxes are poisoned or   
 snared to keep the population         
 down.Foxes live in earths and dens and
 have a thick,bushy tail known as the  
 brush.
