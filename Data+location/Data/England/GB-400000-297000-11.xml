		<title>11ST. MATTHEW'S CHURCH,WALSALL</title>
		<content> The crypt of St. Matthew's dates from 
 the 13th Century, although alterations
 were made in the 15th and 19th        
 centuries. The Lych or Corpse gate was
 built in 1927 as a memorial to George 
 and Catherine Gill. The churchyard    
 railings were taken away for scrap    
 during World War 2. By 1756 the       
 churchyard was full. St. Matthew's    
 didn't have a pulpit until 1603.      
 St. Matthew's stands on a hill known  
 today as Church Hill with a cobbled   
 street and a flight of steps leading  
 up to the church. Churchyards were    
 busy places in the past and           
 parishoners made solemn agreements    
 there. In the past the market cross   
 stood at the foot of the steeple and  
 poultry, dairy produce and other      
 market goods were sold there.         
 The symbol of St. Matthew's is a man  
 with wings holding a banner.          </content>
