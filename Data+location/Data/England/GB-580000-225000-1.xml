		<content> Greenstead Green, Stisted, Tumblers   
 Green,Priors Green and Burtons Green  
 are set in a rural and picturesque    
 part of North East Essex.  The        
 undulating countryside has plenty of  
 hedgerows, farmland and woodland which
 support a variety of wildlife and     
 plant life.  Two thirds of the area is
 farmland growing a variety of cereal  
 crops while a third of the area is    
 woodland, mainly decidious, which     
 supports a fine herd of fallow deer   
 and a few muntjac.  Many people in the
 area use  these woods for walking and 
 during the shooting season, organised 
 shoots take place, mainly for the     
 pheasants that are allowed to feed    
 freely.  There are no main roads,     
 shops or industrail processes carried 
 on in this block.
