		<content> Shildon is the birthplace of railways 
 and the District Council is keen to   
 promote this as a tourist attraction. 
 The line between Shildon and          
 Darlington was the scene of the 150th 
 anniversary celebrations in 1975 and  
 the Hackworth Museum was              
 established.It was Timothy Hackworth's
 cottage which was converted and the   
 remains of the Soho Works are         
 preserved as a monument to him as the 
 father of the locomotive.A life size  
 replica of the {Sans Pareil}engine is 
 on display at the Soho Works museum.  
 Darlington have a Railway Museum which
 they promote to encourage tourism and 
 it is felt by Sedgefield District     
 Council that the Heritage line passing
 through Shildon, the Hackworth Museum,
 together with tourist attractions in  
 Weardale could be developed to attract
 visitors to this area.                </content>
