		<content> The kind of workers who live in our   
 area fall mainly into two groups,i.e. 
 commuters and farm workers.The        
 commuters go to work in the towns and 
 city round about.They travel mostly by
 car as there are no trains and buses  
 which will stop in the villages.We    
 found out that parents of children in 
 school travel to Hull, Driffield,     
 Beverley, Pocklington and Grimsby to  
 work.These towns are between 6 and 50 
 miles away.The farm workers work      
 mostly in their home villages but some
 travel short distances to nearby      
 farms.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
