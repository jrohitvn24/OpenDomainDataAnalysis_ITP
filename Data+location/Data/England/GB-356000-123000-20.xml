		<title>20OPINIONS IN THE CAMELS'AREA.</title>
		<content>     A survey was conducted into the   
 attitudes of local people  towards    
 R.N.A.S. Yeovilton on the edge of our 
 area.                                 
    In a sample of 140 people only 33  
 people were bothered by the noise of  
 aircraft,while 45 people felt that    
 house prices were higher because of   
 the demand from personnel. 41 people  
 used facilities at the base ,mainly   
 sporting. 115 didnt think the base    
 contributed to traffic problems as it 
 was diversified by the time it came   
 into our area. 122 agreed that the    
 base provides jobs for the people     
 living in our area,but thought it was 
 not a major factor in employment.     
    The Sparkford by-pass is due to    
 be built in the 1980's, 89 out of the 
 140 residents questioned believe that 
 it will be of benifit to local        
 residents.                            </content>
