		<content>    When you enter the airport to board
 a flight, the first thing you must do 
 is{check in}to see if your flight is  
 delayed. Your next task is to have    
 your{cases weighed}at one of the 10   
 points, each for a different location.
 If your luggage is overweight then you
 must pay for the excess. Finally you  
 must wait until your{flight is        
{announced.                            
    When your flight is called you must
 make your way to the security point   
 where your hand luggage is checked for
 weapons or other dangerous articles   
 such as aerosols, using an{X-ray      
{machine.}Even after passing through   
 the metal detector, frequent spot     
 checks are made just to be sure.      
    If your flight is an international 
 one you must then have your{passport  
 checked, then you are free to proceed 
 to the plane.                         </content>
