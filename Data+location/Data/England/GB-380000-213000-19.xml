		<title>19Gloucester's Stuntman.</title>
		<content>  Dick Sheppard progressed from trials 
 and scrambles to stock car driving. He
 later turned to stunting.             
  In 1969 he formed "The Disaster      
 Squad" who smashed cars and trucks at 
 hair-raising speeds. In the first     
 performance Dick jumped a speeding car
 through the first floor wall of the   
 Heanor Boat Inn at Leicester.         
  The latest project is STUNTARAMA with
 Jacquie de Creed. This organisation is
 devoted to all aspects of stunting    
 wherever they are required in the     
 world. Dick has visited 24 countries  
 during his stunting career and has    
 appeared on many TV shows. His name   
 has appeared in "The Guinness Book of 
 Records" many times.                  
  The latest record is that of having  
 walked away from over 1000 car wrecks.
