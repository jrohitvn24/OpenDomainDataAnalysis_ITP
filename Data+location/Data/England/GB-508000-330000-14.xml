   As a farming village, you would     
 expect to see everyday signs of       
 agriculture all the time. There are   
 two farmers in Aslackby. One deals    
 mainly in sheep while the other, in   
 vegetation.                           
   Aslackby has a Post Office which    
 sells confectionary and cigarettes,   
 as well as serving as a newsagents.   
 There is also a bakery which          
 unfortunately does not bake or sell   
 its own bread, but the facilities are 
 still there. The store supplies a     
 bakery round, for Aslackby and other  
 surrounding villages. It sells canned 
 foods,bread,confectionary and various 
 other everyday, household goods. A
