		<title>18Redlynch Questionnaire 1</title>
		<content> A questionnaire was completed by 45   
 inhabitants of the area.Of these, 13  
 had themselves attended the village   
 school, one commencing in 1915.       
   Four people had lived in the village
 more than 50 years.Eleven had lived   
 here between 10 and 25 years.Nine had 
 moved here in the last five years.    
  A question about the age of houses   
 showed that nineteen houses were over 
 100 years old, four of them being more
 than 300 years old.Twenty one were    
 less than 50 years old, four being    
 less than 5 years.The majority of     
 houses are brick built and tile roofed
 but sixteen were consructed in cob or 
 similar material.Some of these have   
 thatched roofs but in some instances  
 the thatch has been replaced with     
 slate.Three houses have some form of  
 wooden construction.                  
                                       </content>
