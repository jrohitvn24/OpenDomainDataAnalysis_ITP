		<content> SURGERY STAUNTON ON WYE               
 The surgery building is owned by the  
 practice 2 doctors are based there    
 with 3 receptionists. They do their   
 own dispensing with drugs from B'ham  
 3 times a week. There are 6 surgeries 
 a week (about 120 consultations) and  
 no appointment system so the doctors  
 can give as much time as each patient 
 needs. Some dislike this but most like
 to know the doctor always has time to 
 listen to them. The doctors also make 
 about 50 home visits a week. They are 
 introducing an age sex register with  
 recalls for cervical smears etc. and  
 unusually they regularly refer        
 patients  to qualified local homoe-   
 opaths and osteopaths.
