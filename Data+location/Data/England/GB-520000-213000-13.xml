		<title>13SCHOOL DAY - PART ONE</title>
		<content> My name is Melissa Hale.  I am 14     
 years old and have one brother and one
 sister.  My sister is five years old  
 and my brother is 15.  I am writing   
 about a typical Monday in my life.  I 
 get up at about 7.15, when I make my  
 way downstairs to get my breakfast.  I
 eat whilst reading or listening to the
 radio, sometimes both.  After getting 
 washed and dressed and making the beds
 the time is about 7.50.  I pack my    
 bag ready for Monday lessons, and make
 my packed lunch.  My friends call for 
 me at about 8.15 and at about         
 8.25-8.30 we walk to Monk's Walk      
 School.  When I get yhere I have      
 registration and my first lesson is   
 English for which we go to the        
 Library.  After break at 10.50 we walk
 down to the Craft Block for Technical 
 Graphics which takes up the rest of   
 the morning.                          </content>
