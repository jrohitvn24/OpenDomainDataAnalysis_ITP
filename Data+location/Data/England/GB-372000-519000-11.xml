		<title>11LEAD MINING</title>
		<content>    From the 18th century onwards the  
 local mines in Scordale were taken    
 over by the London Lead Company. This 
 Quaker-run business was concerned for 
 the moral and social welfare of the   
 miners and their families and Hilton  
 and Murton thrived. Housing was good  
 by the standards of the time, in      
 Hilton water was supplied to pumps and
 troughs. The company arranged         
 schooling for the children, too.(Ref. 
 .A.Raistrick,Two Centuries of         
 Industrial Welfare,1938). The mines   
 closed in 1960 but fortunately records
 and photographs have been kept by     
 Dorothy and the late Edgar Hinchliffe.
 Edgar Hinchcliffe is also the author  
 of the History of Appleby Grammar     
 School and has contributed to major   
 research into the Washington family   
 and to Saint John Boste.(see Appleby  
 entry in Domesday '86)                </content>
