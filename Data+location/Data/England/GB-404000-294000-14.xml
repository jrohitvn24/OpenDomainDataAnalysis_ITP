		<title>14      HOUSING</title>
		<content> We found a mixture of housing in our  
 area. In Kingstanding there are many  
 council houses built in the 1930s to  
 accomodate families from overcrowded  
 inner city areas. Some of these are   
 now owner occupied.                   
   In Great Barr most houses are       
 semi-detached and owner-occupied. In  
 the Walsall area of Sandwell most     
 roads are full of semi-detached houses
 but a few have large detached houses. 
 One is for sale in Pages Lane for     
 Â£72,500. It has 5 bedrooms, a through 
 lounge, a dining room, a fully fitted 
 kitchen, bathroom, side garage and a  
 front and back garden. A nearby semi  
 in Scott Road is for sale at Â£24,500. 
 It has 3 bedrooms, a lounge and dining
 room, kitchen and bathroom, plus a    
 back garden. Both houses have central 
 heating.
