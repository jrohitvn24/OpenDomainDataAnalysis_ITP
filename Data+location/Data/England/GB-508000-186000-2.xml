		<content>    Eastcote is a middle class         
 residential area, there are a variety 
 of house types but the majority       
 appears to be 1930's semi-detached and
 detached houses. They are well spaced 
 out and are well maintained with      
 fairly large well kept gardens. Many  
 have extensions. The majority of      
 people are owner occupiers and there  
 is little rented accomodation. A cross
 section of properties for sale        
 were obtained from local estate agents
 and prices were found to be in the    
 range of Â£40 000/ Â£100 000.           
     Ruislip is very similar with three
 high class roads: Sherwood Avenue,    
 Broadwood Avenue and Park Avenue where
 the prices range from 100 000 to over 
 200 000 pounds. There are a few       
 council houses in Ruislip. These have 
 2 or 3 bedrooms but some have 5 or 6. 
 There are also some flats in Ruislip. </content>
