		<content> The area covered by the twelve squares
 04080411  is basically rural, but     
 includes some industry. Nearly a whole
 square is covered by the reservoir at 
 Blackmoorfoot: at present it is having
 its treatment plant extended and      
 modernised. Most of the remaining land
 is rough grazing. About two, half     
 squares, consist of deciduous         
 woodland, through which are some very 
 pleasant walks.The farms in the area  
 are given over to dairy produce       
 although one produces beef.           
   The area also contains a number of  
 disused quarries which once provided  
 much local building stone.            
   These squares contain some unusual  
 industries such as a vinery for       
 blending wine, a company that makes   
 automatic control system for poultry  
 farmers and a scrapyard which looks   
 very strange set against moorland.    </content>
