		<title>18Buckden Marina</title>
		<content> The{Marina}was built in 1963 and it   
 opened in 1964. In winter{140 boats   
 are kept there and in the summer{160  
{boats.}The boats can fill up with     
 petrol or diesel at the Marina. The   
 boats can also be{repaired.}There are 
{20}different kinds of boats. Some     
 boats have one engine and some have   
 two engines. The boats are only       
 allowed to go at{5 miles an hour}on   
 the river because if they go any      
 faster they are breaking the law.     
 There is an attractive shop for the   
 sailors to buy their food, books to   
 read and clothes to wear on their     
 boats. They{make boats}at the Marina. 
 The biggest boat they are making at   
 present is 35 feet. It will take until
 January to finish it. It is an        
 ocean-going boat.It will cost Â£90,000.
