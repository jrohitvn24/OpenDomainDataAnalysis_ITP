		<content> Scampton School is a Church of England
 School.  It is an old victorian red   
 brick school which was built at the   
 end of the 19th century.  At first    
 there was only one classroom but then 
 the school was enlarged.              
    Fifty years ago Miss Ascott tought 
 8-14 year old pupils.  She was very   
 strict and used the cane and the      
 leather strap.  The vicar's daughter  
 taught the infants who used slates    
 while the older ones used pen and ink.
 There were about 50 pupils most of    
 whom did not go to secondary school.  
 There was no school bus or cars, so   
 children had to walk to school in all 
 weathers. Most children went to Sunday
 School as well as evening service.
