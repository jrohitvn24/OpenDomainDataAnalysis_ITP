		<content> A Mr. Barron,who was over 70,used to  
 walk this way regularly.He travelled  
 all the lanes by the boundaries.People
 think he lived at Mevagissey and may  
 have been a parson.He talked about    
 local history.                        
   The boy renowned as being the       
 foundation of the name,was reputed to 
 hsve been shipwrecked at Pentewan. He 
 then walked up the valley and came to 
 Mr.Sleep's Blacksmiths shop. The      
 Blacksmith asked him his name.The boy 
 didn't know so he was asked where he  
 came from.'London'he replied.It was   
 nothing new in those days for people  
 not to know their ages or even names. 
   Mr.Barren also said that in the days
 of tin steaming at Pentewan a huge    
 wave drowned 27 men working there.    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
