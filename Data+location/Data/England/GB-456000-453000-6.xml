		<content> A survey of spare-time summer         
 activites was carried out among 25    
 boys and 25 girls aged between 7 and  
 11 years at Clifton Without Junior    
 School, York during July 1985.It was  
 discovered that the most popular      
 school play-time activity for boys was
 football.64% of the boys played soccer
 and 24% liked playing marbles.After   
 school 32% played football and 32%    
 played on their bicycles.Others liked 
 tennis,swimming and marbles.48% of the
 girls played organised chasing games  
 in the playground and 28% just talked.
 After school 88% of the girls just    
 "played out." 44% of the girls said   
 they played with boys but only 4% of  
 the boys admitted to mixed games. The 
 school has no field or swimming       
 lessons and both boys and girls wanted
 more playtime facilities such as a    
 football pitch, swings and a pool.    </content>
