		<content> Mr.Wright said he'd lived in the area 
 all his life that there had been a    
 big improvement in buildings.He had   
 lived here for 75 years and was born  
 in 1910.They had to make their own fun
 and games up. When he went to school  
 he used to get a yard of Blackjack    
 (which was a sweet and cost a penny)  
 from the shop which was at Lawson's   
 Mill.He went to Shiphay Stow school   
 and the head master was B.A.Taylor    
 There were 6 classes and about 80 to a
 100 children.He said he'd seen a      
 Zeppelin pass over his house and it   
 was going to March,Cambridgeshire,to  
 drop a few bombs.He helped his father 
 to mow the fields (his father was     
 paid 15 shillings an acre)and when he 
 was hot he went home for a rest and   
 went back at 6.00pm.                  
 (The school records record about 120  
 children and fewer classes)           </content>
