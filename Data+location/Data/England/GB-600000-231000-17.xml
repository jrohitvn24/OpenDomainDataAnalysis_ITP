		<content>         Songers Cottage.              
                                       
   Songers, one of the oldest cottages 
 in England, is 750 years old, and     
 grade one listed. Although Mrs and Mr 
 Arther have lived there for 4         
 years, they have only asked permission
 to put 2 chimney pots on the roof.    
    The structure is mainly beams, with
 a Wattle and Daub coat. Outside, the  
 walls are white, and the roof is plain
 thatched. The windows are leaded light
 and small, so not allowing much light 
 to enter the rooms.                   
    The cottage is in quite good       
 condition, considering its age, and   
 shows no signs of needing to be       
 restored.                             
    The gardens are well laid out, and 
 cover about 1 acre of land, half of   
 which is rough pasture.
