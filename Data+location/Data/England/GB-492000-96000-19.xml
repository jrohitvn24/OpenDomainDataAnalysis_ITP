		<title>19NEWS &amp; VIEWS-SW BOGNOR REGIS</title>
		<content> Bognor Regis has 2 main local         
 newspapers,The Observer and The Post  
 and free newspapers such as the The   
 Guardian and The Promoter.            
 The headlines on 27th June 1985       
 were as follows:                   {  
{'Wash-out summer hits traders'.       
 Bognor, although still in the top     
 three of the sunshine stakes, has so  
 far seen little of the sun.Trade at   
 Pubs, Tea Houses and Cafes is being   
 badly hit but Butlin's is booming as  
 usual.                                
                                       
{'Dearer parking fees could affect our 
{tourist trade'.}A 10p rise in charges 
 has been approved by the local        
 council. Many Bognor residents and    
 visitors that we spoke to felt that   
 the existing charges were already too 
 high and that increasing them further 
 would discourage tourists.            </content>
