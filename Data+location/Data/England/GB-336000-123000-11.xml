		<title>11My Village, Curry Rivel</title>
		<content> In Curry Rivel there are a lot of     
 things to do, like Brownies, Cubs,    
 Dancing Classes and on Sundays in the 
 Church there is a choir. I like the   
 Carnival that we have every year, when
 people dress up as monkeys and cows   
 because they look very funny.         
 In Curry Rivel there are only a few   
 shops.  There is a vegetable and fruit
 shop, a food shop, a Post Office, a   
 basket making shop and some garages.  
 I live at Stoney Hurst Drive and      
 altogether there are about twenty     
 houses.  I like my street because some
 of my friends live there and it is not
 busy for us to play on and we can ride
 our bikes up and down.                
 My dad works at Westlands and         
 sometimes he flies the helicopters.   
 My mum works hard looking after us;   
 my sister aged 6 and my brother aged 2
 and myself aged 9.                    </content>
