		<title>15A visit to the shops</title>
		<content>     I have been going shopping with my
mum for quite a long time now.   I go  
with her every Saturday, we go to      
Hadfield's and Petcher's which are     
local food stores.   Some things have  
changed like the shops themselves.     
When I was younger they were quite     
different and a lot smaller but I still
enjoy it even if things are not the    
same.   They have more stocks of food  
now.   When we go shopping we mostly   
buy bread, chocolate, crisps,          
potatoes,cabbage, tins of peas and a   
lot more.   We walk to the shops, it   
takes us about 5 or 10 minutes.   When 
we have got the food we put it in the  
shopping trolley and then into carrier 
bags.                                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
