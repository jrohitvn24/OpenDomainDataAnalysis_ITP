		<title>11A VISITOR FROM H.M.D.C.</title>
		<content> By Sandra                             
                                       
                                       
         An Officer from Her Majesty's 
 Detention Centre Haslar(H.M.D.C.)came 
 to talk to us and show us a video of  
 what life is like. I thought that the 
 boys that are detained at Haslar go   
 through a lot of aggravation -but they
 deserve it! With fitness training,    
 gardening and cooking it like being   
 part of a family - though these boys  
 from the age of 17-21 are all there   
 for doing something wrong. There is a 
 strict 'army-like' routine and the 180
 or so boys are constantly supervised  
 by prison officers who check their kit
 to see if everything is neat and tidy.
       H.M.D.C. is surrounded by a 15  
 high perimeter fence and very few     
 people ever escape. It used to be an  
 Army Barracks.                        </content>
