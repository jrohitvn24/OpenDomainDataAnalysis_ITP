		<content> We took 2-15 minute traffic counts on 
 the Hackforth village road}and the{A1 
 trunk road. The first was on Friday   
 (June 21st)and the next on Wednesday, 
 (June 26th).On both occasions the     
 count in Hackforth was very low-7     
 vehicles.On the A1}we found more      
 vehicles were travelling south than   
 north and the volume of traffic was   
 much higher on the Friday. It was     
 noted that lorries were more frequent 
 midweek and caravans and cars were    
 more frequent on the Friday.
