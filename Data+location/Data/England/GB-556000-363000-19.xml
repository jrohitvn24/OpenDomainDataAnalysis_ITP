		<content> We were very pleased when our school  
 swimming team won the East Coast Gala 
 recently. Most of the members of the  
 team learned to swim in our Town pool 
 but they were unable to do much       
 practising because the pool only opens
 in the summer as it is an open air    
 pool.                                 
 There has been a lot of discussion    
 about providing an indoor pool for the
 use of the residents in the winter but
 as yet nothing has been done by the   
 local council. Some town's people have
 formed an indoor swimming pool        
 association but have not succeeded in 
 their aim yet.                        
 Several of the hotels have small pools
 but it seems that we will have to wait
 for some time before the people who   
 live by the sea can learn to swim,in  
 safety, at any time of the year!
