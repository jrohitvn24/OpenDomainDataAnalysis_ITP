		<content>    Everyone we interviewed got to     
 places by car. We didn't see any      
 buses or trains when we were there. No
 one biked because there was too much  
 traffic. Some older people said thay  
 they would have liked a more frequent 
 bus service.                          
    Everyone had electricity,          
 telephone,water and main sewage. Two  
 people we interviewed had gas and one 
 had coal heating.
