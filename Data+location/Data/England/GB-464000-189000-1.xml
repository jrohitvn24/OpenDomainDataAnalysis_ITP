		<title>01Ewelme village</title>
		<content> It is a small village with about 600  
 population and lying just off the road
 linking Henley and Oxford. The nearest
 town for shopping is Wallingford.     
 There is a post office which also     
 keeps a small stock of groceries,     
 vegetables and magazines for sale.    
 Nearby is the village hall and a short
 distance away lies a unique group of  
 C15 buildings which comprise a church,
 some almshouses and a school which was
 once a grammar school. The founders of
 this group of buildings were William  
 Duke of Suffolk and Alice, his wife.  
 she was the grand daughter of the     
 poet, Geoffrey Chaucer. In the chancel
 of the church is her beautiful        
 alabaster tomb surmounted by an effigy
 of the Duchess who lies buried near   
 the tomb of her parents.
