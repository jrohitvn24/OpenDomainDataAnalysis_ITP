		<title>19FREE TIME.</title>
		<content>   From the results of a local survey  
 we have found that in the country the 
 farming community{do not have much }  
{free time.}There is always something  
 to be doing on the farm. They also    
 have to travel long distances to reach
 theatres, cinemas e.t.c. so most      
 people just attend the local events   
 such as the village sports, fetes and 
 whist drives.                         
    Michaelchurch does have a{Clay }   
{Pigeon Shoot Club}and a{Cricket Club.}
    Card games are very popular, most  
 families playing regularly at home.   
{Whist}is probably the favourite game. 
    The area is so beautiful that a lot
 of local people enjoy{walking on the  
{hills.}The bad weather in the winter  
 and the lack of local entertainment   
 facilities forces most people to watch
 television or read during these       
 months.                               </content>
