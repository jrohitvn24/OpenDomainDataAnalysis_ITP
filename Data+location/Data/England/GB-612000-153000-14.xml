		<content> Larkey Valley Wood in the Parish of   
 Thanington is situated between        
 Chartham and Canterbury about 3 kilo- 
 metres from the village of Lower      
 Hardres. The 107 acres of woodland    
 were presented to Canterbury City     
 Council by Alderman Frank Hooker in   
 1932 in order that the wood "should be
 reserved to the public for ever". The 
 wood is a relic of a forest which has 
 been in existence continuously since  
 the end of the last ice age. Some     
 parts have been re-planted to produce 
 Standards with Coppice which could be 
 cropped for timber. In 1976 the Kent  
 Trust for Nature Conservation with the
 help of other conservationists pre-   
 pared a management policy for the     
 wood. This is now implemented by      
 Canterbury City Council, with finan-  
 cial assistance from the Countryside  
 Commision.                            </content>
