 his painting was rescued and sewn back
 in, you can see the stiches where this
 was done. We also saw the painting of 
 Sir Coventry Carew who founded our    
 school in 1766 and also of Richard    
 Carew who wrote the famous "Survey of 
 Cornwall".                            
   As we went around the house among   
 the splendid antique furniture in the 
 bedrooms were a few modern appliances 
 and photographs showing that the rooms
 are still used today by the Carew-Pole
 family whose home it still is.        
   The Carew-Pole family are friends   
 with the Royal family and whenever a  
 member the Royal family is in the area
 they usually either visit or stay in  
 Antony House.                         
   Today the house is owned by the     
 National Trust and has thousands of   
 visitors each year.                   </content>
