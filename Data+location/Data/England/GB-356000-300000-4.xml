		<title>04         HARLEY</title>
		<content>   In the village of Harley, the       
 crossroads are situated at the centre 
 and houses are scattered along the    
 roads.  Some of the houses have been  
 built recently but some are very old. 
 Many are quite large, showing a degree
 of affluence.  It is certainly a      
 village for people who enjoy the      
 countryside and who can afford to buy 
 houses.  The gardens and houses are   
 well looked after.                    
   From the village is an excellent    
 view of Wenlock edge.  The church of  
 St. Mary's is situated on the high    
 point of Harley.                      
   Small farms are in the area and also
 the village school, now closed.  Young
 children, therefore,have to travel to 
 school in Cressage by bus or car.     
 There is no pre-school provision in   
 Harley, older children attend the     
 school in Much Wenlock or Ludlow.     </content>
