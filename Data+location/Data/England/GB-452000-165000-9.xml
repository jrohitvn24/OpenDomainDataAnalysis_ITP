		<title>09AMERICANS IN THATCHAM</title>
		<content> The reason the Americans are in       
 England is because they are following 
 their own or their husband/wife's job.
   They came to Thatcham because the   
 Greenham Common Air Base is very close
 and because there are some big housing
 estates where homes are cheaper than  
 at Greenham. They say that they prefer
 living in America to Great Britain    
 mainly because of the climate (lots of
 rain) which is quite cold but without 
 summer heat. In America it may be cold
 in winter but they think the heat in  
 summer makes the climate preferable to
 ours. Whilst on the subject of        
 families, one of them had a bit of    
 English, Irish, Spanish and           
 American-Indian in her!               
  They were not allowed to give their  
 opinion of the Greenham Peace Women.  
 On the whole the Americans don't mind 
 living here, much!                    </content>
