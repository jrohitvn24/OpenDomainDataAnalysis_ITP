		<content> We prepared a survey of sixty five    
 families living in{Hampton-in-Arden.} 
 We wanted to find out the distances   
 which people travelled to their place 
 of work.                              
  Two thirds of those surveyed         
 travelled to work by{car,}one sixth   
 used the{train.}One person travelled  
 regularly by{boat}and{aeroplane.}The  
 remainder were able to{walk}to{work.} 
  Approximately one third of the people
 asked travelled twelve miles to       
{Birmingham.}One eighth travelled ten  
 miles to{Coventry.}One quarter worked 
 within a six mile radius of Hampton-  
 in -Arden. Four people travelled      
 regularly in excess of sixty miles,   
 one of these journeying to{Europe.}We 
 concluded that the majority of people 
 whom we surveyed  worked within a     
 twelve mile radius of Hampton-in-Arden
 and travelled to work by car or train.</content>
