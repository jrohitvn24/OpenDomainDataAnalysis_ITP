		<content> Hope_under_Dinmore can still boast its
 own village school.The{school}was     
{built}in the{1860's.}There was a four 
 bedroomed school house.One room down_ 
 stairs was the{first classroom.}The   
 school was enlarged to give two proper
 sized classrooms.Coal fires gave heat 
 to the school in winter.A coal fired  
 boiler in a little cellar heated hot  
 water pipes running round the school. 
 Depending on the number of pupils,the 
 school has always had a head teacher  
 plus one or two assistant teachers.   
 This means that the school never was a
 large one.The{village}is also{small}&amp; 
{has never been able to supply large   
{numbers of children.}A few years ago  
 the old school house was demolished &amp; 
 a modern classroom built in its place.
 Only 2 of the 3 classrooms are now in 
 use because,sadly,{the 2 teachers now 
{here,only have 26 children to teach.  </content>
