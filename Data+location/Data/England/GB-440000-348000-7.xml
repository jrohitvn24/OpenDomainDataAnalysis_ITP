  Many rhymes are purely nonsense      
 rhymes showing children's enjoyment of
 word games and riddles eg.            
{One fine day in the middle of the     
{night,                                
{Two dead men got up to fight,         
{Back to back they faced each other,   
{Drew their swords and shot each other.
  Rhymes are also said while playing   
 ball games.Children also enjoy        
 giggling over rhymes which mention    
 taboo areas!                          
{      Sporting Games                  
  Catching and throwing and small sided
 games of our country's football and   
 netball teams often take place on our 
 yard and school field.                
{Mock Battles                          
  Many of the playground games become  
 very rough involving fights or "wars".
