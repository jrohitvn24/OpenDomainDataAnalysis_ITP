		<title>16WHAT CORRINGHAM NEEDS</title>
		<content>   IN{CORRINGHAM}WE NEED A{CINEMA      
 BECAUSE PEOPLE IN CORRINGHAM HAVE TO  
 GO TO BASILDON OR GRAYS TO WATCH NEW  
 FILMS.                                
  A{COMPUTER}SHOP WOULD BE HANDY       
 BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE HAVE HOME         
 COMPUTERS AND THE NEED TO BUY SOFTWARE
 SUCH AS GAMES AND EQUIPMENT AND THE   
 NEAREST COMPUTER SHOP WE HAVE IS IN   
 BASILDON.                             
  ALSO A{LAUNDERETTE}WOULD BE VERY     
 CONVENIENT BECAUSE IF SOMEONE HAS A   
 BIG FAMILY,AND THEY GO TO WORK,THEY   
 MAY NOT FIND TIME TO DO THEIR OWN     
 WASHING.SO THEY CAN JUST TAKE IT TO   
 THE LAUNDERETTE.                      
  WE SHOULD HAVE A{WET FISH SHOP}IN    
 CORRINGHAM BECAUSE THE FISH IN THE    
 FISH AND CHIP SHOP IS COOKED IN BATTER
 AND SOME PEOPLE DONT LIKE BATTTER.IF  
 WE COULD HAVE FRESH FISH WE COULD COOK
 IT HOW WE WANTED TO.                  </content>
