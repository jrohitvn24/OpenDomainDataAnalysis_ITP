		<content>  With the help of the Vicar of Sway we
 were able to learn a little as to how 
 the area has changed over the last few
 decades.                              
  Over 80% of the population has moved 
 in over the last 20 years many people 
 moving in from Scotland, the Midlands,
 London and Yorkshire. Many wealthy    
 people and those due to retire come to
 this area for health reasons or       
 seeking solitude. Old people rely on  
 neighbours for transport but often the
 nearest neighbour is a quarter of a   
 mile away.There's a{bus}every 2 hours 
 between Lymington and New Milton      
 coming via the Wheel Inn but this is  
 limited and reportedly unreliable.    
  Many large houses have been turned   
 into flats or nursing homes. Sway     
 Court &amp; Arnewood Court are now flats, 
 the latter built of concrete by Andrew
 Peterson who also built Sway Tower.   </content>
