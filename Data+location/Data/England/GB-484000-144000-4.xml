		<title>04   THE MALTINGS (continued)</title>
		<content> Lunchtimes at the Maltings is busy and
 popular with all age groups. Snacks   
 and drinks are available from Monday  
 to Saturday. Rooms may be booked for  
 special occasions such as weddings,   
 evening dinners etc.                  
  Although the Maltings is now buzzing 
 with activity, much remains to be     
 done. 40 per cent of the building     
 remains unconverted.A Development     
 Trust was launched in 1984 with       
 the task of raising Â£600 000 over five
 years to convert the final stage. This
 will include a conference centre,craft
 workshops, a video and film workshop  
 and additional bar and catering       
 facilities.                           
   The Maltings has come a long way in 
 the last fifteen years and the        
 community of Farnham have a centre of 
 which they can justly be proud.
