		<title>14ANTIQUE SHOPS IN BROADWAY</title>
		<content>{Broadway}has many fine antique shops  
 and picture galleries. Some of these  
 specialist shops are branches of well 
 known London firms. It is possible to 
 buy original 17th and 18th century    
 pieces of furniture and have them     
 packaged and documented for export.   
 Shopping for antiques in{Broadway}is  
 popular with Americans! Some shops    
 specialise in old china, especially   
 Worcester porcelain, and others sell  
 exquisite jewellery and silverware.   
 The local auctioneers hold regular    
 furniture sales in the Lifford Hall.  
 Some antique furniture sold at these  
 sales is restored locally and then    
 exported to America. A wide variety of
 antique prints, maps and old books are
 available in one shop and elsewhere   
 a selection of old paintings, both in 
 oils and water colours, is offered    
 for sale.                             </content>
