 car with white ribbons on.  She is    
 dressed in a white dress and veil.    
 The bridegroom wears a smart suit. The
 bride has attendants who are called   
 bridesmaids.  The bridesmaids wear    
 long dresses and have headbands with  
 flowers on.  The bride and bridesmaids
 carry posies of flowers.  There is a  
 best man who looks after the wedding  
 rings and makes sure that everything  
 goes smoothly.  After the wedding     
 there is a reception.  There are      
 toasts to the bride and bridegroom and
 then they cut the wedding cake.  There
 is a meal at the reception and then   
 when the tables are cleared there is  
 dancing.  There is a bar where drinks 
 can be bought.  The reception often   
 finishes late at night.
