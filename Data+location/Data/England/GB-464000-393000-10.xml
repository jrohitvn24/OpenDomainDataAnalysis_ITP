		<title>10The Village of Austerfield</title>
		<content>  Austerfield is a small village lying 
 alongside the busy A614.The dwellings 
 are of a variety of types and ages.   
 Some new houses and bungalows have    
 been built at the South end of the    
 village while the Norman church and   
 older houses occupy more central      
 positions.Several of the latter lie   
 directly alongside the road.Also in   
 the centre is a large fire_brick works
 which results in sticky black dust and
 a faint smell of carbon overlaying the
 area.The only shop is the Post Office.
  The population is an ageing one.Of   
 the 450 inhabitants only about half a 
 dozen are school aged children and    
 there is a high proportion of retired 
 people.Although the area is a rural   
 one the number of working farms has   
 declined from 9  at the beginning of  
 the century to one.The remaining land 
 has become part of larger concerns.   </content>
