		<title>10CULTIVATED LAND USE S.DOWNS</title>
		<content>    Farming the downland consists of   
 ploughing for crops, managing grass-  
 land &amp; animals, &amp; forestry management.
    Crops grown are usually cereals,   
 but sometimes roots. In October fields
 had been ploughed but not sown.       
    Much of the land is cultivated     
 grassland, but there is some rough    
 grazing.  Hay has been cut &amp; rolled.  
 Friesian cattle graze &amp; a few horses  
 are near Broadham House. Sheep were   
 only seen grazing near Newhouse Farm. 
    Forestry management consists of    
 clearing old trees &amp; replanting with  
 conifers or deciduous trees. Singleton
 forest has large areas of replanted   
 oaks, beech and sycamore. There are   
 various areas of conifers with wide   
 grassy rides between them as fire     
 breaks, &amp; stony tracks for timber     
 removal.  Foresters cull the deer to  
 prevent damage to young trees.        </content>
