		<title>19Hellesdon's Library</title>
		<content> The library was built in 1960 and has 
a total membership of 6,000 people.The 
librarian (Mr.Wright) has access to    
23,000 books.The library was visited by
500 children in"Children's week". There
is a range of books for all ages,from  
story books to factual books,and there 
are braille books for the blind.There  
is a "Friend Of The Library" scheme    
which raises money to pay for spoken   
word cassettes. They have a microfiche 
which helps you to find your book.The  
library has 6 cubicules for private    
study. So many people used the library 
they had to build an extension. This   
extension was built in 1977.
