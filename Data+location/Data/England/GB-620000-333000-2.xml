		<title>02Restoration AT Gunton Hall</title>
		<content>Gunton Hall,built in 1742 for the 1st  
Baronet Harbord by Mathew Brettingham  
was until recently a derelict mansion. 
It was bought in 1980 by Kit Martin,   
architect, who has since rebuilt       
the cottages round the 3 courtyards    
and converted the kitchens,bakeries,   
laundries,breweries,coach houses and   
stables,making a total of 20 dwellings 
in the service area.The Hall itself has
been converted with minimal            
changes architecture into 4 large      
houses.The latest restoration involves 
the rebuilding of the burnt out        
ballroom block,the result of the       
disastrous fire of 1882 The complex of 
the 24 houses,now privately owned      
appears very much as Samuel Wyatt      
designed it when he trebled the size   
of the origonal squires house for the  
Lord Suffield in the 1780s.
