		<content>  Two of the most significant events in
{Kemble's }history are about to happen.
 Like most rural communities denied the
 luxury of city and town water-borne   
 sewage disposal systems, villagers    
 have had to rely on cesspits, privies,
 earth closets and (even in the last   
 decade) that modern derivative, the   
 chemical closet. Even the introduction
 of septic tanks is often made         
 ineffective here by the geological    
 feature of clay overlying the{Kemble  
{Shelf}limestone outcrop. Now, after   
 the promises of the 1930s and the     
 plans of the 1960s, work will shortly 
 commence on a sewerage system costing 
 almost a million pounds of public     
 money, eliminating the known and      
 potential health hazards for over 200 
 households and providing the chance   
 for a new development of 50 houses - a
 minor population explosion.           </content>
