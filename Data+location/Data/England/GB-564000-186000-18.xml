		<title>18A TYPICAL LAINDON SCHOOL DAY</title>
		<content> Most of the children in our school    
 walk there. We wait in the playground 
 until the whistle goes. When we get in
 class we do early work, maths for 30  
 minutes and handwriting. Then it is   
 assembly followed by playtime. When we
 come in we continue with the work on  
 our lists. This work could include    
 topic activities, art, p.e, maths,    
 language work. Sometimes we watch a   
 television programme or listen to the 
 radio, as part of our topic work. We  
 have a computer which everyone enjoys 
 because it doesn't really seem like   
 work.                                 
 Lunch time is from 12 o'clock until   
 1.15p.m. School ends at 3.10p.m. Many 
 children in our school belong to one  
 of the school clubs. As some children 
 want to belong to more than one, clubs
 are held before school starts, at     
 lunch times and after school finishes.</content>
