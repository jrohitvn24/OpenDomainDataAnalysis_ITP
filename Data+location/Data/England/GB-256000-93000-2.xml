		<title>02OKEHAMPTON CASTLE</title>
		<content> After the Battle of Hastings, risings 
 in the west were harshly suppressed. A
 strong hold at Okehampton seemed a    
 necessity for Baldwin FitzGilbert. It 
 was partly chosen for its site in the 
 gap  between moor and hill, at the    
 joining of several routes westward,   
 but also because Baldwin held many    
 manors in this area. The Castle was   
 rebuilt around 1180 to suit its new   
 owner the Courtnays, who held it for  
 the 350 years. In 1538 the Marquis of 
 Exeter was beheaded for conspiracy and
 his Castle ordered to be dismantled.  
 It has been a ruin ever since. Late   
 last century it was bought by Mr S.   
 Simmons, and is now entrusted to the  
 Department of the Environment. The    
 custodian, Harry Palmer, is a local   
 figure often seen riding his bicycle  
 around town if he isn't looking after 
 his Castle and his ducks!             </content>
