		<title>08PENKRIDGE NATURE RESERVE</title>
		<content>The reserve consists of two lowland wet
meadows and lies approximately three   
miles west of Penkridge, near Whiston. 
The reserve is about two acres and     
comprises two meadows separated by a   
brook, and enclosed by another brook   
and trees.  The Staffordshire Way      
footpath runs through the meadows, and 
The Penkridge Naturalists manage the   
reserve. The area is botanically rich  
with typical wetland plants, but has   
uncommon species such as orchids, fen  
bedstraw and little teasel.  The cover 
provided by the reserve attracts       
interesting bird species such as       
woodcock, woodpeckers, owls, blackcap  
and grasshopper warblers.              
Butterflies are abundant during the    
summer months.
