		<title>01National Nature Reserve</title>
		<content> This 4x3 km block has roughly 1 sq km 
 of land at Dowlands, Charton Bay and  
 Humble Point and was the site of      
 the Great Landslip of 1839 at         
 Dowlands.  This strip of coast forms  
 part of the Seaton-Lyme Regis coast   
 walk, a 6 mile path between the pebble
 bar at Axmouth and Devonshire Head at 
 Lyme Regis.  This path, a National    
 Nature Reserve under the protection of
 the Nature Conservancy Council (NCC), 
 follows some of the wildest terrain in
 southern England and the visitor on   
 this four hour walk will be rewarded  
 with views over the sea as well as a  
 wide variety of woodlands, plants,    
 animals and birds.  On our walk       
 exploring this path we met Norman     
 Barns of the NCC who is the author of 
 an informative pamphlet about the     
 reserve and responsible for its       
 well-being.                           </content>
