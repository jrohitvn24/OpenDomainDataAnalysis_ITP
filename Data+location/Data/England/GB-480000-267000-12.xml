		<title>12Sywell Rectory.</title>
		<content>The Incumbent of Sywell Church and its 
sister church, St. Nicholas in         
Overstone, lives in a Regency Rectory  
set in two and a half acres of ground a
short walk from Sywell Church. Each    
summer, the Rectory Garden Party is    
held in the grounds. There are usually 
a variety of stalls and games to play  
and refreshments can be enjoyed at     
tables on the lawns overlooking the    
magnificent countryside. It is an      
afternoon much enjoyed by those who    
attend. Muntjac deer, rabbits, moles   
and foxes are frequent visitors to the 
grounds as are swallows in the summer.
