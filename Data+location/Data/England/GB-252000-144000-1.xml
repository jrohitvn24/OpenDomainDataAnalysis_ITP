		<content> The 4km x 3km section grid ref        
 02520144 slopes north towards the     
 Bristol Channel and on a clear day    
 Wales can be seen.Many of the valleys 
 have steep wooded slopes.             
 Apart from the sections covering      
 Ilfracombe and part of Berrynarbor    
 village there are only isolated farms 
 some of which have existed since the  
 1066 Domesday book.                   
 Most of the roads are narrow winding  
 country lanes, mainly being slightly  
 more than the width of one car, with  
 passing bays for cars to pass when    
 they meet.                            
 The lanes and fields have high hedges 
 built from stone and earth with trees 
 and bushes growing from them and      
 covered with many plants.Travellers   
 along these country roads will        
 oftenmeet tractors or at milking time 
 herds of cows going from field to farm</content>
