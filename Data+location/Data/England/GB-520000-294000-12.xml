		<title>12Leisure Activities</title>
		<content>   We did a survey to find out what the
 people who live in do their leisure   
 time.Amongst children we found that   
 the most popular pastimes were        
 watching television and going swimming
 but a lot of children also said that  
 they liked fishing,cycling and playing
 games.The most popular sport was      
 football,followed by tennis,cricket   
 and athletics.Almost half of the      
 children we asked belonged to an      
 organisation like Cubs or Brownies and
 many of them had pets or played a     
 musical instrument.                   
   Adults chose watching television and
 watching sport as popular pastimes,and
 shopping,gardening,listening to       
 music and going to a public house or  
 club were also chosen.Many people like
 decorating as an activity.Very few    
 people were involved with fund-raising
 or church activities.                 </content>
