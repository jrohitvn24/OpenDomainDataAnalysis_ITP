		<content>  Tidworth is situated in undulating   
 countryside on Salisbury Plain midway 
 between Andover and Amesbury on the   
 A338. The Hampshire/Wiltshire border  
 runs through the centre of the village
 from East to West. There has been a   
 village here since 1086 with evidence 
 of even earlier occupation possibly   
 going back to the Bronze Age; with    
 remains of Tumuli, Earthworks and Hill
 Forts in the area. The Ministry of    
 Defence bought North and South        
 Tidworth and part of Shipton Bellinger
 in 1894,a total of 6616 acres.        
 Tidworth today is a Military Garrison 
 with the barracks and training areas  
 dominating. Of the 12000 population,  
 10000 are military personnel and their
 families. There is a central shopping 
 area with houses to the North and     
 South and Barracks to the South West.
