		<title>06OTTERBOURNE CARNIVAL WEEK</title>
		<content>     {Carnival Week}started after the  
 Queen's Silver Jubilee in 1977, when  
 they had all the fun of the fair that 
 we have today. Carnival Week is held  
 at the end of June or the beginning of
 July. It is a time when people enjoy  
 themselves and hopefully give         
 generously to a good cause. This year 
 it is the Langley House Trust.        
     Every year a new Carnival queen is
 selected and also two Carnival        
 Princesses. If you become one of these
 you are presented with a headband and 
 lettered sash.The Queen receives a    
 card and Â£10 00, the Princesses Â£5    
 00.One of their duties is to attend   
 all the events in the week such as the
 Old Tyme Music Hall, Knock Out        
 Cricket, Songs of Praise, Children's  
 Disco, Bingo, Brass Band              
 Concert,Modern Sequence Dancing       
 Evening, and the Carnival Procession  </content>
