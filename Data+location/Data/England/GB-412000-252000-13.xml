		<title>13TOURISM AROUND GRAFTON</title>
		<content> We get a lot of tourists in Temple    
 Grafton as we are near Stratford. We  
 have 60km of paths and 6 nature       
 trails.We also have 4 caravan parks   
 one of which is permanent.Caravan     
 rallies are also held here.Welford has
 two public houses, 'The Bell' and the 
 'Four Alls'. Boating is also popular  
 on the river at Welford. Tourists     
 visit Stratford to see Shakespeare's  
 Birthplace, staying at a Bed and      
 Breakfast establishment or Hotel.They 
 could also go to the Theatre. In      
 Grafton itself there are very few     
 recreational facilities.There is a    
 restaurant called 'The Stables' where 
 they do Bed and Breakfast and a public
 house, 'The Blue Boar'.
