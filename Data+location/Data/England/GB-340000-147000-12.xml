		<title>12FARMING IN THE WEDMORE AREA</title>
		<content>   Nearly all{farmhouses}are made of   
 local stone. Most are over 200 years  
 old and have no central heating. Some 
 have thatched roofs under their tiles.
 One farmhouse does Bed and Breakfast  
 and one has a caravan site.           
   Three{Vets}operate a modern surgery 
 in Blackford with a 24 hour service.  
 2/3 of their time is farm work.They   
 most commonly deal with pregnancy     
 problems in cows. Each vet may work as
 much as 100 hours in a week.          
   Cattle are sent to local{markets,}  
 the most popular being Highbridge.    
 Others used are Bridgwater, Winford,  
 Taunton, Bristol and Glastonbury.     
   The imposition of{milk quotas}by the
 Common Market in 1984 is unpopular    
 with farmers and is causing economic  
 hardship for some of them.
