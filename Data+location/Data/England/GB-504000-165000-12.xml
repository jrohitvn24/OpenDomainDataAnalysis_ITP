		<title>12Chertsey Bridge</title>
		<content> The first bridge was of wood,built in 
 1410 and was maintained by the Abbot  
 of Chertsey Abbey on whose land it was
 built. Then, as its condition         
 deteriorated it was repaired, but     
 uneffectively, so in 1780 James Paine 
 was commissioned to design a new stone
 bridge. Costing Â£7,325, the 5-arch    
 bridge did not actually reach the     
 banks, so Â£2,800 was needed for       
 completion, in 1785.                  
 200 years later, the bridge stands    
 strong, and on Sunday 9th June, the   
 residents of Chertsey celebrated its  
 continuous existence, and the Mayor   
 revealed a plaque in its honour.      
 Claims to fame include a mention in   
 Charles Dicken's "Oliver Twist," and  
 was recently the setting for a Channel
 4 T.V. programme "Fairly Secret Army."
