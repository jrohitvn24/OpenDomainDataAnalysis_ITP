		<title>16Education in Milton Ernest</title>
		<content>{Milton Ernest School}was founded to   
 provide education "according to the   
 principals and practice of the Church 
 of England".It is legally owned by the
 Trustees of its Church of England     
 Foundation but it is controlled by the
 Local Education Authority, which      
 accepts full financial responsibility 
 for its maintenance.                  
 At the age of 9+ the children transfer
 from the{Lower}to the{Middle School   
 and at 13+ they transfer to the{Upper 
{School}where they remain until they   
 attain 16 or 18 years of age.         
 Following a survey of{Milton Ernest   
 and{Radwell}it was found that one     
 third of the families with children of
 school age choose to send one or more 
 children to a private school. Two     
 thirds of the families send their     
 children to a state school. There is a
 local private pre-school Nursery unit.</content>
