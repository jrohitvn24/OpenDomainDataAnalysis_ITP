		<content> Beaumont Park is a residential area   
situated near Whitley Bay and is 1.5km.
from the North Sea.A survey was carried
out to find the affluence of people    
living on the estate.We recorded the   
number of cars and television sets a   
family owned.We found 3% owned 0 cars, 
49% owned 1 car,43% owned 2 cars and 5%
owned 3 cars,giving us an average of   
1.5.We also found 18% owned 1 T.V,     
45% owned 2 T.V's,28% owned 3 T.V's,7% 
owned 4 T.V's and 2% owned 5 T.V's.This
gave us an average of 2.3 T.V's per    
household.The results suggest that     
families who live on Beaumont Park are 
very affluent and most people owned a  
car probably because they worked out of
the area and there was a lack of trans-
port around Beaumont Park.
