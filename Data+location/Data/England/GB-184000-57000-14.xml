		<title>14Tresillian Barton Farm</title>
		<content>  Farming has been carried on here for 
 a very long time.The name means 'the  
 home farm in the sun' and was spelled 
 Tresulian in 1335. It has been the    
 home farm of the Trisillian Estate    
 since medieval times                  
  Sir Robert Tresillian b.1340 was made
 Lord Chief Justice by Richard 2nd to  
 suppress the Peasants Revolt.He       
 condemned 1500 people to death by     
 hanging, but in 1386 he was beheaded  
 at Tyburn and hanged up-side down in  
 chains.                               
  Today the farm is owned by Mr Rex    
 Davey and Sons.It is located 240 feet 
 above sea level and four miles from   
 Newquay.Farming is highly mechanised, 
 being mainly devoted to the production
 of milk,beef and lamb based on home   
 grown cereals and intensive use of    
 grassland.Three-quarters of farm      
 revenue comes from livestock.         </content>
