		<title>11KNUTSFORD'S ITALIAN BUILDING</title>
		<content>   On Legh Road there are Italian      
 houses built by Richard Harding       
 Watt.In Victorian times he visited    
 Italy often which is where he got his 
 ideas. His houses have many towers,   
 and the roofs have semi-circular      
 slates that run downwards. He loved   
 birds which is why some of the bricks 
 stick out. He was a very busy man who 
 rushed everything. His first house was
 on a hill but it fell down because it 
 wasn't planned properly.              
   Other buildings created by Watt     
 include the King's Coffee House, with 
 the Gaskell Memorial Tower.  His      
 original plan for the town was more   
 ambitious, but some parts were never  
 built and others fell into decay.     
 Even so, Watt's buildings remain a    
 unique feature of our town.
