		<content> Part of a larger area of gently       
 rolling mixed farmland in the junction
 at the glaciated Teme and Clun        
 Valleys, the block is dominated by the
 afforested Coxall Knoll and the       
 pasture and parkland slopes at        
 Bedstone Hill which occupy its western
 quarter. Farming and forestry are the 
 only economical land uses, with the   
 exception of Bedstone College, a      
 private school occupying a victorian  
 mansion with its surrounding parkland.
 Lying between and served by larger    
 villages, the block only contains     
 three isolated hamlets. Public        
 electricity and telephone services are
 available for all, but no gas and for 
 most of the population no public water
 nor sewage disposal services. Most    
 individual users afford the latter for
 themselves by way of bottled gas,     
 wells and septic tank systems.        </content>
