		<title>19FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS,FAIR OAK</title>
		<content>    The original Fair Oak, a village of
 mainly small Victorian and Edwardian  
 houses, a pub and a church and a few  
 shops has been surrounded during the  
 past thirty years by many building    
 estates. These ,in many cases are of  
 detached and semi-detached homes, an  
 assortment of houses and bungalows.   
 Several blocks of apartments for the  
 elderly have been built. There are    
 some rented council houses but most   
 are owner occupied.                   
    Land is scarce and there are cases 
 of old houses with large gardens being
 demolished to give way to as many as a
 dozen new homes.                      
    The area is in commuting distance  
 from London and other large centres   
 which has led to a large 'floating'   
 population.                           
    Increased housing has led to       
 problems with traffic.                </content>
