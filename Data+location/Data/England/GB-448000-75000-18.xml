		<title>18Blackgang Fantasy Theme Park</title>
		<content> Blackgang Chine Fantasy Theme Park is 
 situated on the South Western tip of  
 the Island. Originally opened to      
 the public in 1843 by Alexander       
 Dabell, it has been continuously      
 developed by succeeding generations of
 the same family.Over the past 20      
 years,the gardens,perched on the      
 cliffs 400ft.above dangerous Chale    
 Bay,have become home for such diverse 
 theme areas as a Cowboy Town,Jungle-  
 land,Dinosaurs,Nurseryland and        
 England's finest maze.The cliff form- 
 ation is such that landslips are fre- 
 quent and over the last 50 years some 
 300 yards of the park have been lost  
 to the sea.In 1981,Blackgang Sawmill  
 was opened and in 1984 "St.Catherine's
 Quay" was added. With these new feat- 
 ures and continuing development,it is 
 hoped that this top Island attraction 
 will continue for years to come.      </content>
