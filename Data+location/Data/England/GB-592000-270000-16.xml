		<title>16BY-PASS</title>
		<content>A By-pass is being built around our    
village to ease the traffic congestion.
This is caused by lorries on their way 
to and from the Midlands to Felixstowe 
Docks during the week and on summer    
Saturdays by holiday traffic, on its   
way to the Broads or Norfolk coast.    
A school traffic count found that about
10000 vehicles pass through Ixworth    
each day. During the sugar beet        
campaign (October - January) there is a
lot more(The factory is in Bury        
St.Edmunds).                           
The by-pass leaves the A143 just south 
of the village and passes to the east. 
Roundabouts are to be positioned on the
A1088 Stowmarket Road and on the       
Walsham-le-Willows Road. From the      
latter the road will join the A1088    
Thetford Road. The cost will be about 3
million pounds. It is due to open in   
1986.                                  </content>
