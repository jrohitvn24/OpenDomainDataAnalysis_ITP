		<content> The first bombing occurred in central 
 Gorleston during 1941. Children were  
 evacuated away from the town, schools 
 were closed,the population fell       
 considerably, few vehicles other than 
 for military purposes were on the     
 streets, which became untidy. As      
 access to the coast from France and   
 Belgium was likely security was       
 enforced in the area, by use of       
 identification cards. The town became 
 a focal point for daytime air raids on
 Germany, and as many as 1000 aircraft 
 would collect in the sky above the    
 area. Gorleston beach was mined and   
 barbed wire and anti aircraft guns    
 were were placed along the coast, and 
 a high gun tower was erected near the 
 ferry. There was the constant fear of 
 invasion or bombing, particularly     
 since the port was used by the Royal  
 Navy.                                 </content>
