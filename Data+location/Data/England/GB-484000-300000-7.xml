		<content> The remains of a motte and bailey     
 castle occur to the west of the       
 Leicester Road. Access is alongside a 
 parish boundary hedge almost opposite 
 the last house on the Leicester Road, 
 going away from Uppingham. The motte  
 (raised mound) overlooks Wardley Wood 
 and is covered in trees and scrub,    
 presumably because of a lack of       
 grazing on the steep sides. Three     
 parish boundary lines converge about  
 the motte. The bailey part is now a   
 cereal-covered flat field between the 
 motte and the Leicester Road.         
     The castle is mentioned in{The }  
{Mediaeval Earthworks of Rutland}by{R.}
{F. Hartley}and published by
