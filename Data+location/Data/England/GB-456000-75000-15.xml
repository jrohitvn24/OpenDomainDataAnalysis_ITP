 St. Catherine's is the parish church  
 of Ventnor. It was consecrated in     
 1837. John Hamborough provided the    
 money. The church seats 196 people and
 has a gallery. In recent years the    
 church hall was sold and a side aisle 
 converted into a hall. The church     
 originally had a spire a-top a tower  
 but it was removed because of earth   
 movements. This year the pinnacles    
 were removed as well. The Vicar of    
 Ventnor is The Rev. Malcolm Pickering.
 During the winter approx. 60 people   
 attend the Sunday Service but this can
 rise to 80 in the summer. The church  
 gives 10% of the previous year's      
 income to charities. The church has a 
 number of clubs for all age-groups.   
 St. Boniface School is attached to St.
 Catherine's Church.
