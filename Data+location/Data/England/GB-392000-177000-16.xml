		<title>16A Day in the Life of Kay</title>
		<content> As an ordinary housewife I am up first
 and wake the family about 7.15 am.    
 While they wash, dress and have       
 breakfast I prepare packed lunches for
 Alan to take to work, and Lucy and Ben
 to take to school.                    
 After taking the children to school I 
 do the routine housework, loading the 
 washing machine, making beds,         
 cleaning, hoovering etc.              
 I then find time to write a couple of 
 reports for the local newspaper, for  
 which I am village correspondent.     
 When I have collected the children at 
 3 pm, there is time to potter in the  
 garden before preparing and cooking   
 the evening meal. A typical menu is   
 liver and bacon with creamed potatoes 
 and carrots, followed by semolina.    
 By 8.30 pm the children are in bed,   
 and Alan and I relax, perhaps watching
 television or listening to music.     </content>
