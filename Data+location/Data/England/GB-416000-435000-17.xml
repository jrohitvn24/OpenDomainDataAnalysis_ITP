		<title>17Road Junction,Bradford</title>
		<content>   The Greengates junction joins       
 Harrogate Road and New Line in the    
 centre of Greengates village.Some     
 traffic lights control the traffic    
 travelling from Keighley to Leeds and 
 from Bradford to Harrogate.The opinion
 of pedestrians using the junction is  
 that it is too busy.A shopkeeper      
 reckons that the increase in traffic  
 is partly due to the opening of a     
 large supermarket nearby.             
   Many lorries,cars and buses use the 
 junction every day.Plans have been    
 drawn up to widen the junction yet    
 again which would involve destroying  
 part of the village.We counted 89 cars
 passing through a certain point in a  
 space of 5 minutes.Some shopkeepers   
 favour a roundabout but others fear   
 this would cut off access to their    
 shops.
