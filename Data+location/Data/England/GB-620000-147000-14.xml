		<title>14Barham During World War 2</title>
		<content>Early one morning a Dornier 17Z German 
aircraft crashed on to the old railway 
bridge about 100 metres from the       
village school.Recently a local        
resident found a piece of the          
wreckage embedded in a tree and was    
able to recover it.A large bomb        
exploded near the church leaving       
a 2 metre crater but no houses were    
destroyed.Children from Rochester and  
Gillingham were evacuated to Barham.   
School hours were divided amongst the  
groups.But as it proved to be dangerous
here,the children soon returned        
home.Some families had their own       
bomb shelter while others shared.They  
sometimes invited soldiers who were    
camping out nearby in for a meal .The  
village hall was used as a canteen for 
the soldiers.The R.A.F were stationed  
at the nursing home;fighters were      
repaired in a hangar behind the house. </content>
