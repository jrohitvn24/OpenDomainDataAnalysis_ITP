		<content>   The services for the area are       
 provided by two local authorities,    
 Blackburn provides for the area in    
 Lancashire, and Bolton for the area in
 Greater Manchester. These services    
 include weekly refuse collections,    
 sewage disposal, street and lighting  
 maintainance and cleaning, and the    
 upkeep of parks and public gardens.   
   There are no library facilities in  
 the village, but 35% regularly use    
 nearby libraries.                     
   The local authorities provide for   
 the education of the children,        
 although the Church provides for the  
 upkeep of Walmsley School. Children   
 residing in Lancashire are educated in
 Bolton at secondary level, and        
 residents in Lancashire rely on Bolton
 to provide other than basic           
 facilities.
