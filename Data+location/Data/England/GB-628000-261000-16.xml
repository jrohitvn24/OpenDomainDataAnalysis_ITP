		<title>16Framlinghan Town Council</title>
		<content>We spoke to Miss Monica Tett who is the
chairman of our Town Council. She told 
us that it has 15 members who do a     
variety of jobs(architects, company    
directors, housewives a milkman and    
teachers, like herself). When she goes 
somewhere officially  representing the 
town she wears the official badge. On  
it are symbols: a wall for the         
castle, green for the grass, blue for  
the Mere,a lion for the Dukes of       
Norfolk crosses for the churches and a 
book for the schools. The Council owns 
the churchyard, the cemetery, Castle   
Meadow and Castle Pond, Pageant Field  
and the Market Hill. Income from the   
stalls on the Hill is used to          
supplement income by rates to pay for  
town services. The town is responsible 
for 52 footpaths and 2 bridle paths    
and some street lighting. The Town is  
linked with Coucy le Chateau.          </content>
