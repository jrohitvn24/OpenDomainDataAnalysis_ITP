 doctors,pharmacists and dentists.3% of
 the sample are university lecturers.  
    I would consider that this is      
 about right for our block of land as  
 Lymm is considered as a dormitory     
 village for the surrounding cities    
 and towns,and so would have a low     
 unemployment rate,and a low retirement
 rate.                                 
    Most of the housing in this block  
 is largely privately owned with very  
 few council owned properties.Most     
 houses tend to be large semi-detached 
 buildings many years old or newer     
 detached houses in a small built up   
 area,showing that the Lymm area is a  
 rural area of wealthy people.
