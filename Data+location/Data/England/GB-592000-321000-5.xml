		<content> Whissonsett School was built in 1868, 
 it's quite small with only 34 pupils, 
 they have two classrooms each about   
 the same size. The school has four    
 exits one out of each cloakroom, one  
 from the kitchen, and one from the    
 assembly hall. The school also has a  
 small library in one corner of the    
 assembly hall.                        
  The school has a P.E shed and lots   
 of gym equipment.                     
  A big field is used to play netball  
 and football and in the summer they   
 play rounders.                        
  The school has a staff of two        
 teachers. The kitchen is quite big    
 with a cooker, but they don't cook    
 their own meals, they get them from   
 Weasenham School.
