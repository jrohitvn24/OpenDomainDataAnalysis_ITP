		<title>06TRAFFIC FREE CENTRE? HULL</title>
		<content> As in most big cities the growth in   
 the volume of{traffic}has caused major
 problems.   Over 25,000 people are    
 employed in Hull's{city centre}and the
 conflict between traffic and          
{pedestrians}has occupied the thoughts 
 of the town planners for years.   The 
 old{'ring-roads'}are no longer        
 adequate to divert heavy traffic and  
 so now{'Orbital'}roads have been built
 north and south of the city centre.   
 Thus greater{pedestrianisation}can    
 proceed.   Whitefriargate was paved in
 1974 and similar works at the Pier and
 Market Place have now been completed. 
 This is a continuing plan to produce a
 major{pedestrian area}from the Old    
 Town, through the city centre to      
 Ferensway.   Redevelopment can then   
 take place for the Marina, hotels and 
 in particular, for attracting people  
 to live in the centre of the town.    </content>
