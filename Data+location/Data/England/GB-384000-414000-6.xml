		<content> I arrived at Alf Kaufman School at    
 8:30 this morning. As usual I opened  
 the mail and dictated any replies.    
 During the day I interviewed a parent 
 whose child is to come here, swam in  
 the pool with Class 4, then supervised
 a table at dinner. Later I filled in  
 forms and talked to a speech therapist
 about a child. I got an invitation to 
 be presented with a cheque for school 
 funds.The money came from a sponsered 
 run.In the evening I went to the      
 Curtain Theatre with some fiends to   
 see a play. After the theatre we went 
 to Norden Cricket Club for pie and    
 peas, a drink and to meet some        
 friends. I will be in Norden again    
 tomorrow when my nephew gets married  
 at Norden Parish Church.
