		<title>09HIGHAM FERRERS' ROYAL VISIT</title>
		<content>The smile of the Queen warmed the heart
of Northamptonshire on the 3rd May     
1985. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh  
arrived in a Rolls Royce. The Queen was
wearing a blue coat and hat with a     
black handbag and white gloves.        
                                       
The streets were lined with flag waving
crowds, flags and banners covered the  
shops and houses. The Royal Couple were
greeted by loud cheers as they were    
introduced to the Mayor and Mayoress.  
During a walkabout , Prince Philip     
picked a child up so that she could    
give the Queen some flowers.           
                                       
A bouquet was presented by a sixth     
former from the Ferrers School, who    
said she was so excited it brought     
tears to her eyes.                     
The royal couple then went on to visit 
farms on Duchy land nearby.            </content>
