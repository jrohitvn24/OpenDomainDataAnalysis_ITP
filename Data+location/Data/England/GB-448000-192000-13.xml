		<title>13Employment in the Area.</title>
		<content>    Our D-block is not a very heavily  
 populated area. Some people who live  
 in the villages work on local farms   
 and in shops but many more have to    
 travel for their work. The town of    
 Abingdon provides jobs in such places 
 as Local Government Authorities,      
 Health Services and in light industry 
 on small industrial estates.          
    Other people work further afield in
 places such as the British Leyland car
 factory at Cowley, near Oxford, the   
 blanket factory in Witney, the Atomic 
 Energy Research Establishment at      
 Harwell, the J.E.T. project at Culham 
 and the Rutherford laboratories.      
    Many people commute via Didcot and 
 Oxford railway stations to work in    
 either Reading or London.             
    We are lucky in this part of South 
 Oxon as unemployment is low. Work is  
 available for those who wish it.      </content>
