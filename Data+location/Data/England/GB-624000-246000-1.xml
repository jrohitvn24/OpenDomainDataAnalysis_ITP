This area of Suffolk was surveyed by   
three schools:                         
    Kingston Middle,Woodbridge,        
 Gorseland and Beacon Hill Primary     
            Martlesham.                
                                       
The old town of Woodbridge is situated 
on the west bank of the River Deben.   
It's development has centred around the
river and the {Tide Mill}.             
                                       
Martlesham is an old settlement which  
borders the main East Coast road now   
the A12. The{Red Lion Inn} was once a  
famous stage coach halt beside a ford  
on the River Fynn. A bridge wasn't     
built there until 1930!
