		<title>12The Parish Council</title>
		<content> Nine people are on the parish council 
 which is elected every four years.    
 They look after all the things that go
 in Stallingborough. This costs money  
 which comes from the rates .The two   
 main facilities the council provides  
 are the playing field and the village 
 hall.The village hall is used by      
 different groups for their meetings.  
 The parish council likes to promote   
 pride in the village community and    
 they publish a monthly newsletter     
 about village activities.The council  
 are pressing for a bypass to be       
 built.They would like to stop lorries 
 going through the village to reach the
 factories and make Stallingborough a  
 quieter and safer place.There are     
 plansto build a new housing estate    
 but the council doesn't want a large  
 estatebecause it might spoil the      
 character of the village.             </content>
