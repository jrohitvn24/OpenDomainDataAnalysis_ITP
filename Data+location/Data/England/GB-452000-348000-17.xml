		<content> Most Christian denominations are      
 represented in Hucknall. The town     
 covers three{C of E}parishes each with
 their own vicar. The{Roman Catholic   
 Church has one worship centre on      
 Watnall Road.{Non-Conormist}tradition 
 in Hucknall is very strong although   
 many smaller chapels have been closed 
 and amalgamated to form larger        
 worshipping units.The{Baptist Church  
 is flourishing with two worship       
 centres.{Methodist}congregations hve  
 declined although there is a new      
 church centre. Other groups in the    
 town include the{Salvation Army, the  
{Pentecostal}Church,the{United Reform  
{Church}and the{Assemblies of God.     
 Results from a questionnaire revealed 
 that although large numbers of people 
 are C of E, only a small percentage   
 worship on a regular basis.
