		<title>15Fewer School Children</title>
		<content> In September we are losing a teacher  
 and we shall have only 3 classes with 
 75 children on roll. Our Headmaster   
 says that 12  years ago there were 270
 children in the school and 8 classes. 
  The reason our numbers have gone down
 is mainly because the prison officers 
 do not have to live in Princetown now 
 but can live in Tavistock, Yelveron or
 other places and travel to work. The  
 Home Office is only retaining a small 
 number of quarters and is in process  
 of handing back the majority to the   
 Duchy.The Duchy, in turn is handing   
 some to the local council.            
  Our Headmaster and other people in   
 the village are concerned about it    
 because there have been so many empty 
 houses for so long. The population of 
 the village has decreased from about  
 1000 to 800 and the nature  of the    
 village has changed in recent years.  </content>
