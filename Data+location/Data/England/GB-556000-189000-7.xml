		<title>07WILD FLOWERS: WARLEY, ESSEX</title>
		<content>   Amongst the less common plant       
 species found on roadside verges were 
{Hedge Bindweed, Marsh Bedstraw}and    
{Wild Rose.}The most interesting       
 associations were found along Tomkyn's
 Lane, however, 566897, a narrow lane  
 with little traffic. Expenditure cuts 
 have meant that these verges are cut  
 seldom. Trees overhang it, providing  
 plenty of shade. Here were found plant
 associations not found elsewhere.{    
{Lady's Smock, Wood Millet,}and{Dead   
{Nettle, Red Campion}and{Hoary         
{Plantain.}The track to a nearby farm  
 had{Tufted Vetch}and{Early Purple     
{Orchid}beside it. Verge cutting, as   
 well as the use of agricultural       
 chemicals would seem to be responsible
 for the relative scarcity of many of  
 England's wild flowers.
