		<title>02Elwick Village</title>
		<content> Elwick is a small village just off the
{A19}and four miles west of{Hartlepool.
 It has a large green with trees on    
 it , most of which are one hundred    
 years old. The trees were planted to  
 commemorate Queen Victoria's Jubilee. 
 The green has a Telephone Box,a       
 drinking fountain built on top of an  
 old blocked up well,a bus shelter and 
 two or three public seats.The village 
 is set in the countryside surrounded  
 by farms and is connected,by a wooded 
 ghyll,to{Dalton Piercy.}Part of the   
 ghyll near the church has been        
 flattened to make a playing field. We 
 have a church, two public houses,a    
 school,a W.I.Hall, an old school which
 is used as a Church Hall,and a shop   
 which has a Post Office in it.
