		<title>06A Shop in Sharlston.</title>
		<content>  My Grandad has a butcher's shop on   
 Weeland Road in Sharlston. He sells   
 all sorts of meat which he gets from  
 the abbattoir in Leeds. As well as    
 cuts of meat he sells pork pies,      
 sausage rolls, buns and pastries which
 he makes himself. Alf and Steven, who 
 work for Grandad, bake all these      
 things in the bakery behind the shop. 
 Grandad, Grandma, Norman, Roger and   
 sometimes Steven as well, all work in 
 the shop serving people. The shop is  
 open Tuesday - Friday, 9.00 - 5.30 and
 Saturday 9.00 - 12.30. Saturday is    
 always the busiest day and Christmas  
 is always the busiest time when he    
 sells lots of turkeys. At the moment  
 Grandad is on holiday and Roger is the
 boss. Most of the customers live in   
 Sharlston and are old people.
