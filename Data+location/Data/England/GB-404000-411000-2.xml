 A church is where you go to sing and  
 pray. Earlier this year my class went 
 to St Bartholemew's church to look    
 around.When we got to the church we   
 went up the church tower. We went up  
 seventy steps.   When we got to the   
 bell chamber we had a look around. Mr 
 Rippinggale said that we could stay in
 the bell chamber until the bells were 
 rung. It was very good staying behind 
 the clock face.After the bells had    
 rung we went back down the seventy    
 steps to the church and Mr Rippingale 
 showed us around.

 The guides,cubs,scouts and brownies   
 meet in the Methodist church hall.The 
 Good Companions have their meetings   
 there as well.
