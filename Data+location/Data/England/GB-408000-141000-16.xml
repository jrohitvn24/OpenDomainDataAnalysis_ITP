		<title>16PLANS TO DEVELOP STONEHENGE</title>
		<content> There has been growing dissatisfaction
 among visitors to Stonehenge with the 
 way that the site is presented to     
 them.                                 
 In 1984 a commission was set up to    
 look into the future development and  
 preservation of the site.             
 The Stonehenge Study  Group in        
 conjunction with English Heritage     
 published a report in 1985 showing    
 several plans and options for         
 improving the facilities within and   
 around the Monument.                  
 One proposal put forward was for a    
 series of visitors' centres           
 strategically placed to give the      
 visitor a clear view of the monument  
 and an opportunity to see parts of the
 surrounding area in context. The      
 significance of the round barrows and 
 earthworks and the Cursus could then  
 be made apparent.                     </content>
