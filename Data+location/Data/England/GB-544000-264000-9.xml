 Mrs Pullan said she didn't know much  
 history about her shop.Most of her    
 customers came directly from the      
 village.She said she didn't have the  
 faintest idea whether her shop would  
 change in the future,but when she goes
 the shop goes with her.The Social     
 Clubs she runs are;the Golden Oldies  
 over Sixties club,which was held once 
 or twice a week.She also held womens  
 Institutes and so on.There are three  
 or four fetes held every year,also she
 told us the fete is traditional or for
 charity or other uses.They do not have
 any floats at the fete but they have  
 all sorts of things going on          
 like;tombola, a fancy dress parade and
 lots more.Nothing could be changed    
 according to her.There is a toddler   
 group but no schools in Landbeach.    </content>
