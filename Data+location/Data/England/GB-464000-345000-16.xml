		<title>16A LOCAL CHURCH SERVICE.</title>
		<content>  On Sunday 7th July I went to St      
 Mary's Church in Lowdham.It was the   
 Vicar's last service at Lowdham before
 he moves on to be Rector of Whitby.   
  Inside ,the church was decorated with
 flowers because there were two        
 weddings the day before.We sat at the 
 back near the font which was also     
 decorated with flowers because there  
 was going to be a christening.        
  The service started at 10am when the 
 choir in their long red robes led the 
 way down the aisle to the choir       
 stalls.We sang hymns and listened to  
 bible readings and the Vicar's sermon.
  Then a little girl was christened.   
 Next was the service of Holy          
 Communion.The adults were given bread 
 and wine and the children were        
 blessed.At the end of the service we  
 went home.                            
                                       </content>
