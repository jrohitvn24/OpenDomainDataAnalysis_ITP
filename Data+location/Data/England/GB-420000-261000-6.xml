  large baskets of Hot Cross buns round
 the village.As children traffic was no
 problem,we played{Whip &amp; Top}in the   
 street.The top was placed in a        
 convenient hole at the side of the    
 road &amp; then whipped until it spun,then
 we kept it going to school.We employed
 a ploughman, two maids,a gardener and 
 a chauffeur.The villagers found work  
 as farm labourers, thatchers or in    
 service at the big houses.The present 
 village is no longer close knit.It has
 become a commuters village,people     
 coming from the towns,going to the    
 towns to do shopping,sending their    
 children to schools outside.The       
 traffic has increased so that         
 pavements have been built.The village 
{had}a shop/post-office,garage,timber- 
 factory,Red Horse Inn,market garden &amp; 
 a cinema once a week in the vill.hall.</content>
