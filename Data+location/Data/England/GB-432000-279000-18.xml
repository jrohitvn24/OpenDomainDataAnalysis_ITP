		<title>18Cash's Factory.</title>
		<content> Cash's factory was built in 1856 by 2 
 brothers, John and Joseph Cash. They  
 built their silk-weaving factory in   
 Kingfield Rd. They built houses for   
 their workers and the workshops were  
 built above the houses on the second  
 floor.The energy for the machines was 
 provided by steam.The industry        
 produced ribbons which were  used by  
 ladies for their hats, hair and       
 dresses. Soldiers used them for their 
 medals.The workshops had large windows
 to let in plenty of light.Some of the 
 buildings were used by Cash's until   
 last year but the factory has now     
 moved to new premises in Tile Hill.   
 Coventry Churches Housing Association 
 have bought the old houses and factory
 and made them into modern rented      
 homes.
