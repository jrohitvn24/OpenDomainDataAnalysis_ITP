 At the top of Catterlen village there 
 is an old school house. The school    
 closed before 1924.The River Petteril 
 is the boundary  between Newton Reigny
 and Catterlen.There is also the M6    
 motorway as the boundary at the other 
 end of the village as it goes straight
 through farmland. A well-known face   
 lives in our village:Neil Doughty,    
 who won the 1983 Grand National with  
 his horse "Hello Dandy".About half-   
 way up the village there is Catterlen 
 Wood. Neil Doughty lives opposite the 
 wood. There is now a good road,the    
 B5305 that's past the bottom of the   
 village. There is also a road that    
 runs through the village and on to    
 Newton Reigny and Laithes.There used  
 to be an old Blacksmith's but it has  
 closed and some other people live     
 in the house now.                     </content>
