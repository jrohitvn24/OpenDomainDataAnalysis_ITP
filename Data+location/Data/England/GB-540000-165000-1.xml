		<content>    Our block lies on the edge of      
 London and was mainly developed in the
 1930s with some post-war infilling.   
 Old communities at Hayes, Keston and  
 Bromley Common have been swallowed up 
 by this new housing.                  
    Yet over half the block has yet to 
 be developed thanks to a determined   
 effort against continual pressure to  
 erode the Green Belt. A sizable farm  
 still operates and other land is used 
 for a variety of recreational         
 purposes. Hayes Common and Sparrow    
 Wood are mainly wooded areas open to  
 the public.                           
   Transport is important to the local 
 people as many commute.  Bromley      
 remains a major bottleneck for cars   
 and most London commuters travel by   
 train from Hayes, Orpington or Bromley
 South.                                
                                       </content>
