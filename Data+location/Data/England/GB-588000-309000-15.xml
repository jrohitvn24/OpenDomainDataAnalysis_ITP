		<content>    The area is mainly one of Arable   
 farming.  A great deal of{Winter      
{Barley}is grown which is sold at local
 markets for malting or for animal     
 food. Grain is harvested and put into 
 driers and then stored in siloes until
 it is sold.                           
                                       
    More land is being used for growing
 cash crops. {Sugar Beet}is common as  
 there are nearby sugar refineries at  
 Kings Lynn and Whissington. {Peas}are 
 grown and vined under contract to     
 freezing companies in Kings Lynn and  
 Fakenham.  Some{Fodder Beet}is also   
 grown for animal food.                
                                       
    Poultry farming is also carried out
 on a large and a small scale.  Battery
 hens are kept in large sheds where    
 they produce eggs which are sild      
 locally.                              </content>
