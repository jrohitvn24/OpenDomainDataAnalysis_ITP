		<title>19FLORA - PONDS &amp; STREAMS</title>
		<content>    The banks of the streams are not   
 good                                  
 for flowers as they are periodically  
 cleaned out by the River Board and    
 mostly only annuals such as thistles  
 and willowherb can survive this       
 treatment.  The many ponds in this    
 area are often overhung with trees and
 too dark for much plant life or where 
 there is an open pond the edges are   
 often trodden by grazing cows. Sedges 
 and reeds are common on poor ground.  
 In marshy areas there are fine clumps 
 of kingcups and yellow flags and      
 hemlock water dropwort in almost every
 ditch.
