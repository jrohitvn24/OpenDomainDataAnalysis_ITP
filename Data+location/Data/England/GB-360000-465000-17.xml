		<content> The morning starts at 6.30 for Thomas 
 and David. They get up to milk the    
 cows. Grandad helps. Grandma cooks    
 bacon, eggs and fried bread. Outside, 
 Grandad scoops the cream off the milk 
 and gets a bucketful of milk. After   
 breakfast Grandma cooks cakes and     
 shortbread. I go out and play. Then   
 Grandma peels the potatoes for dinner.
 We have chips, vegetables and cold    
 meat and rice pudding. When we have   
 finished, we do jobs like feeding     
 calves, de-horning calves, letting the
 cows out, checking mole traps. Then we
 ride our bikes around the yard, and   
 make a tent on the lawn. After tea, we
 play cards and do jigsaws. Grandad is 
 usually at an auction. We have salad  
 for supper. I wash the lettuce and cut
 the tomatoes. Thomas and David let out
 the cows. An hour later, we go to bed,
 and the adults at about 9.30.         </content>
