 Our alloted area is very open and     
 countrified with large areas of       
 undeveloped farmland.There are lanes  
 running through fields of wheat,      
 barley and rape.Houses and farms are  
 are dotted around and are often quite 
 isolated.There are many footpaths that
 go through local farms and woods.It is
 a very quiet area with buildings of   
 interest including a windmill and a   
 watermill . The river Pant which      
 travels to the Blackwater Estuary in  
 Maldon, runs through our area slowly  
 making its way to Shalford.The river  
 is joined by many streams and ditches 
 which have replaced hedges to make    
 farming easier.
