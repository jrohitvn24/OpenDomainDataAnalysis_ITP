		<content>       The Church of the Holy Cross in 
 Babcary was probably built under the  
 influence of King Ina of Wessex, who  
 built the nearby Monastery at         
 Glastonbury.                          
       The church that still stands    
 today was built in the 14th/15th      
 centuries and the church was restored 
 in 1875.                              
       The inside of the church is full
 of flowers, and it is very gay and    
 colourful, and the altar is very      
 impressive. The church is built of a  
 single type of stone, and the         
 church-yard is well kept, but many of 
 the older memorials before 1800 are   
 illegible.                            
       There is also a hall which is   
 used as a chapel at Hazlegrove, and   
 services are held every Sunday during 
 the term time.                        
                                       </content>
