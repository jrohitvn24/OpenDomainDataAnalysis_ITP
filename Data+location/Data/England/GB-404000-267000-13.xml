		<title>13Going to Smallwood Hospital.</title>
		<content> One day at my school which is St.     
 Stephen's First School, I had an{     
{accident}in the playground. I cut my  
 face just near my right eye. I went in
 Mr. Sage's car to{Smallwood Hospital} 
 where a nurse looked at my face and   
 said a doctor would have to see it.   
 There are no doctors full-time in the{
{casualty department.}They have to get 
 a doctor from the{health centre}to see
 people who have had accidents. When he
 came he put a stitch in my cut and    
 stopped it hurting. I had to go back a
 few days later with my mum to have the
 stitch out. Soon there will be a big{ 
{new hospital}in Redditch and our      
 little old hospital will have to be   
 closed down. My mum says it will be a 
 pity because Smallwood Hospital is a  
 friendly place and the new hospital   
 won't be so friendly.
