		<content> In Spring time we had a decorated egg 
 display and an Easter Bonnet          
 competition. After our two week{Easter
 holiday, we started learning maypole  
 and country dancing to dance to our   
 parents outside on the grass. We took 
 part in a{Music Festival}with 13 other
 First Schools. The theme was "The     
 Sea". We acted and danced "The Little 
 Seal Girl". In July we had{Sports day,
 when everybody had fun and lots of    
 races. We have five weeks summer      
 holiday. In the{Autumn}we have a      
{Harvest Festival.}We usually make a   
 big Harvest Loaf like a sheaf of corn 
 and a scarecrow and sing Harvest      
 songs. I like Havest. Near{Christmas  
 we have a Christmas bazaar, with      
{Father Christmas.}We put on plays for 
 our Mums and Dads and then have a big 
{Christmas party.
