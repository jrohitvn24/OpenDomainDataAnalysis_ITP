		<title>17NARROW GAUGE RAILWAY RIDE</title>
		<content> When I went on the train trip a lot of
 people waved to me. I went past       
 Redland Tiles and saw the Brambles    
 Kennels and I know who lives there. I 
 saw lots of flowers in fields and at  
 the edges of the track. When we       
 stopped near a lorry we smelt a horrid
 pong of diesel. When we went across   
 roads everybody in cars or any vehicle
 all waved to us as we went by. When we
 stopped at the end of the track,      
 before we were on the way back, we    
 asked a few questions. We asked if our
 train had a name. The driver said that
 it is the only train without a name   
 but they were going to call it 'Uncle 
 Bulgaria' when the "Wombles" were     
 popular. ("Wombles" are puppets _     
 supposedly little animals living on   
 Wimbledon common). On the way back I  
 saw things from a different angle. On 
 the way back people picked flowers.   </content>
