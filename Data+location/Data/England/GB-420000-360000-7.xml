		<title>07Houses in Elton</title>
		<content>  The houses are almost all built of   
 local gritstone. Many of the older    
 houses in the centre of the village   
 were built in the 17C. and 18c. during
 the leadmining era. Dwelling and farm-
 houses cluster together along the     
 spring-line between the gritstone and 
 limestone. Former shops, workshops,   
 the Smithy etc. can still be seen on  
 Main Street now used as garages.      
  In recent years new building has been
 restricted to infilling. There are    
 some Council houses. Many houses have 
 solid fuel central-heating and many   
 retain open fires. Electricity is     
 connected but not gas.                
  During the past 15 years there has   
 been an increased demand for houses   
 from people prepared to commute from  
 Matlock, Bakewell and Chesterfield and
 prices have increased tenfold.
