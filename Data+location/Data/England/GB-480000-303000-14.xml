		<title>14River Chater in Leighfield</title>
		<content> The River Chater from Launde to Leigh 
 Lodge is one of the few unimproved    
 watercourses in Leicestershire,       
 retaining a characteristically        
 meandering course with pools          
 interspersed by riffles. Below the    
 fishponds a steep scarp slope to the  
 south supports a rich spring fed marsh
 now designated a Site of Special      
 Scientific Interest. Plants here      
 include great horsetail, marsh        
 marigold, wood clubrush, spotted      
 orchid and fleabane, all now uncommon 
 in Leicestershire. Further downstream 
 the watercourse has preserved from    
 cultivation a series of small patches 
 of marsh,rough grassland and scrub    
 which are some of the richest areas of
 wildlife habitat in Rutland.Blackcaps,
 garden warblers and willow warblers   
 nest here and butterflies include     
 skippers,gatekeepers and ringlets.    </content>
