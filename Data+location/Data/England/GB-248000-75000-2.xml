 edge of Dartmoor.There are several    
 streams running through Peter Tavy,   
 one of them contains trout.Most of the
 land around the village is used for   
 grazing sheep and cattle.It is spread 
 over quite a wide area of land but    
 there are not many houses.A lot of the
 houses are old but there are a few new
 houses.Peter Tavy has an Anglican     
 church and a Methodist chapel.The     
 village has a weekly bus service to   
 Tavistock and a post office which is  
 also a shop.The village school has    
 been closed and is being converted    
 into a house.It is a changing village 
 old people are moving out to smaller  
 houses and young families are moving  
 in.However Peter Tavy is quiet during 
 the week days because most people are 
 at work.
