		<title>10Fishing in Cound Brook.</title>
		<content>    We had a week off school.In that   
 week I went to Cound Brook to fish for
 trout.When we got there I went to the 
 brook with my net,tub and wellies on. 
 I had to duck down in the long wet    
 grass so the fish would not see me.My 
 green 'T' Shirt helped to camouflage  
 me.I peered through the rails and saw 
 a trout moving his fins and hovering  
 in the same place.It was coloured a   
 gloomy grey.I swooshed at it with my  
 net.I missed it!                      
    It flew off so fast I could not see
 it.All I could do now was to slip the 
 net over the hole that I thought it   
 had gone in.Then I propped the end of 
 the net on the rails. With my long    
 stick I prodded around in the reeds.He
 rushed out of the side reeds and      
 tricked me.I did not know where he    
 went then,so I said,"I give up!"and   
 walked off.                           </content>
