		<content> Wadebridge market was started in{1902}
 as a result of action by the{         
{Mercantile Association}which urged    
 improvement of facilities. The market 
 moved from its original site on{The   
{Platt}to its present site in{Polmorla 
{Road}in{1911}.Sales took place in the 
 open pens provided for cattle sheep   
 and pigs. Gradually the committee     
 provided covered accomodation. The    
 auction ring includes a large weighing
 machine to weigh fat cattle. The      
 market is held each{Monday}. Only one 
 firm of auctioneers is authorised to  
 sell livestock but traders may sell   
 plants, chemicals, medicines and      
 machinery. During{1984}animals passing
 through the market included{5,324     
{bullocks},{3521 calves},{23715 sheep} 
 and{790 pigs}.Periodically horse sales
 are held.
