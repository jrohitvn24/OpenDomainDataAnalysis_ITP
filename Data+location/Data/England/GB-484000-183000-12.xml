		<title>12THE GOLDEN BALL  P.H.</title>
		<content>   The Golden Ball has been a Public   
 House for over 500 years. It is owned 
 by the Wethered Brewery. The licence  
 is held by the Whitbread family.      
   Inside The Golden Ball there are    
 lots of low beams. Several alterations
 have been made in the pub and there is
 now a restaurant in one bar. Outside  
 there is a garden for adults to sit in
 and a play area for children, with    
 swings and a man-made tree which has a
 big face painted on it.               
   The Golden Ball opens at lunchtimes,
 and in the evenings. Sometimes special
 entertainments like an Italian evening
 and barbques, are arranged.           
   About 150 people visit The Golden   
 Ball each day. The most popular drink 
 is lager, beer costs 80p for a pint,  
 and a gin &amp; tonic costs 97p. In the   
 restaurant you can have a good meal   
 for about Â£3.50.                      </content>
