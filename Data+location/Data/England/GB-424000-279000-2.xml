		<content>    During  May &amp; June 1985 we tried to
 record the crop growing in all fields.
 Farmers were provided with a map dated
 1952, &amp; asked to state type of crops &amp;
 update field boundaries.We discovered 
 many fields have increased in size by 
 4 times.Hedges have been grubbed up &amp; 
 pit-ponds filled in to aid the use of 
 larger machinery &amp; increase production
 Two small areas of woodland have      
 disappeared.Land use is balanced  be_ 
 tween grass &amp; cereals.Grasslands are  
 used for cattle pasture, hay &amp; silage.
 Childrens' ponies are often seen in   
 the paddocks. The cereals are wheat &amp; 
 barley in equal acreage.Other crops   
 include peas, potatoes &amp; oilseed rape.
 Rape has  become a relatively common  
 crop only in the past 5yrs.Its vived  
 yellow flower shines across the fields
 &amp; its pungent scent adds a new        
 dimension to Warwickshire in May/June.</content>
