		<content>   Informal education for children     
 starts at the age of about three when 
 they attend the local village         
 playgroups for a few hours per week.  
 There are playgroups in Barnston and  
 Felsted where there is also a private 
 nursery and preparatory school known  
 as Felsted Kindergarten School.       
                                       
   Although Felsted is dominated by    
 private education, most of the local  
 children enter the state system at the
 age of five, which in Felsted means   
 going to school just outside the main 
 village, and from Barnston and Little 
 Dunmow they travel to Great Dunmow.   
                                       
   At the age of eleven up to eighteen 
 years, the majority of children travel
 to the Comprehensive School at Great  
 Dunmow.
