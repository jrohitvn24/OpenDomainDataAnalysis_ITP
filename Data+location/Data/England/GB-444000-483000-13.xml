		<title>13FELIXKIRK GUN CLUB.</title>
		<content>  Felixkirk gun club has been in       
 existance for 12 years. It is situated
 in a field well away from house in the
 village. At present the premises are  
 being refurbished. A large car park   
 has been laid and thousands of pounds 
 have been spent on automatic equipment
 for projecting the saucer shaped clay 
 pigeons.                              
  The 80 members of the club are drawn 
 from all walks of life and are not    
 just local people. Some come as far   
 away as Teeside, Leeds, Harrogate,    
 Boroughbridge to do their shooting.   
 The club is divided into 3 sections;  
 the Cleveland League with 30 members  
 and Open Practice with 20 members and 
 Local Section numbering 30 members    
 mainly older people not wishing to    
 travel to competitions.
