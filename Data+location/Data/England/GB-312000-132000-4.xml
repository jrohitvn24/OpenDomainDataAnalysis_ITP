		<title>04GAMES THE CHILDREN PLAY</title>
		<content> The infant children play lots of games
 at school and they explained how to   
 play some of their favourites.        
                                       
                                       
 " In 'There was a princess long ago'  
 you make a circle and dance round and 
 sing the song.  The princess goes to  
 sleep for a hundred years.  A gallant 
 prince wakes her up and everybody is  
 happy at the end."                    
                                       
 " When we sing 'Do you know the Muffin
 Man?' we stand in a circle.  Somebody 
 has to stand in the middle with the   
 blind fold on. He hits someone with a 
 roll of newspaper and then that person
 sings the reply.  Then the person in  
 the middle guesses who it is."        
                                       
 " I play 'Blind Mans Buff'.  You have 
 to be blindfolded and chase people."  </content>
