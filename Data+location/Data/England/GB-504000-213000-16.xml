		<title>16SUNDAY IN FLAMSTEAD</title>
		<content> During a typical Flamstead Sunday     
 people tend to unwind after the       
 working week.Many families sleep in   
 longer although some still attend the 
 local morning services at 9.30am in   
 church or chapel at 10.30am.There is  
 still quite a tradition in the village
 for Sunday roast lunch with meat      
 bought from the popular local butcher.
 There are few activities in the       
 village although the children play    
 with friends on the recreation ground 
 or in the surrounding countryside.We  
 are near to many local attractions for
 example Whipsnade Zoo &amp; Woburn Safari 
 Park so parent often take children    
 out.Many villagers are keen gardeners 
 and Sunday afternoons are often spent 
 in this pursuit or in car washing and 
 polishing.In Winter there is little to
 do in the village.
