		<content>  Today  Mrs.Boston  came to talk to   
 us about Wootton.Mrs.Boston  used to  
 teach at Wootton Lower School and     
 has lived here all her life.          
 Across the road from where Mrs.Boston 
 lives there used to be an old school  
 but now there are four houses.When    
 Mrs.Boston was a little girl she used 
 to call it the little school.To get   
 to school Mrs.Boston only had to      
 cross the road .Around the school     
 there was a big wall and Mrs.Boston   
 played throw and catch with a ball.   
 In those days children could play in  
 the road because there was not much   
 traffic at all exept the odd horse    
 and cart or bicyle.Apart from that    
 the roads were empty.In the little    
 school there were two rooms and there 
 was a rickety stair case that led to  
 a teachers flat above the school.
