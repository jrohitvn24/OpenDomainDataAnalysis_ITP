		<content>    Trafford will not have a new       
{hospital}of its own.This means  that  
 the money which could have been spent 
 on the new hospital is now going to be
 spent on extending{Wythenshawe        
 hospital in Manchester.               
    Many children living in Hale,      
 Altrincham and Bowdon take part       
 in  annual festivals.Included in      
 the{festivals}are processions ,music  
 ,dancing and people generally enjoying
 themselves.                           
    In the year 1988 Trafford has      
 planned to merge the Boy's and Girl's 
{Grammar Schools}in Altrincham.They are
 both to be sited at the Boy's Grammar 
 School because at the Girl's Grammar  
 School there are three buildings and  
 the playing fields are quite a        
 distance away.The proposed school will
 have only one main building and close 
 by there are fields for sports.       </content>
