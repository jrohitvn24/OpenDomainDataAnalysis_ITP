		<content>   With the development of modern      
 supermarkets,people with small        
 business in Raynes Park find          
 themselves being forced to end their  
 trading because of the low prices     
 supermarkets offer. We also found that
 many of the empty shops were toy or   
 model shops,so it seems that people do
 not have the time or money for these  
 any more or are getting them from     
 larger department stores. With some   
 unemployment in this area,some  young 
 people cannot afford such 'luxuries'. 
   The shops ,even those which are     
 still open do not seem to do much     
 trade. They are old buildings and are 
 fairly tatty and dirty both inside and
 out. There is dust from the roads and 
 the railways and only newly           
 established shops and offices seem to 
 be able to afford the rents for the   
 new buildings.                        </content>
