		<content>{Calving:}A Holstein bull is put to the
 Friesian cows and calving is from     
 October through to April. Last year   
 they had 110 calves and of those they 
 only have 35 left. Mr.Cocks deals with
 all the calving himself and only calls
 in the{vet}if an animal is sick.      
  A farmer's life is very demanding.His
 animals rely on him all the time and  
 he cannot leave them unattended. He   
 only has{two helpers}with him on the  
 farm. One is a farm labourer and the  
 other a tractor driver. The labourer  
 does the manual work, such as mucking 
 out the pens. The tractor man feeds   
 barley to the beef cattle, spreads    
 slurry on the land in winter and      
 cleans and maintains the machinery.   
 Ditches are cleaned out to prevent    
 flooding. A{contractor}is employed to 
 trim the hedges in the Autumn.They are
 kept thick to prevent cattle escaping.</content>
