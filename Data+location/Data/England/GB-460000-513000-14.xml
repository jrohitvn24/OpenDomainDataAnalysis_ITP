		<title>14Housing-Hunters Hill Estate</title>
		<content> We(3rd years at Belmont Jun.School)   
 did a survey of this large estate in  
 our catchment area.Our school was     
 built in 1968(Juniors) &amp; 1972         
 (Infants).The estate started in 1965  
 with houses built by Craigton Combined
 Securities Ltd.Most of the estate was 
 built in the early 1970s by Minton    
 Construction,George Wimpey,GCT Constr,
 Erscombe Properties,&amp; other firms.The 
 last houses came in 1976 (Pinedale    
 Estates Ltd) but a shopping precinct  
 was opened in 84 &amp; a pub (J.W.Cameron)
 in 79.Most houses are detached 3-bed- 
 room houses or bungalows.Not surpris- 
 ingly most of our parents have recent-
 ly come here. 16 years is the longest 
 that anyone has lived in Guisborough. 
 The area seems to be popular; most    
 people we asked mentioned their       
 gardens or the surrounding forests as 
 amenities they particularly liked.    </content>
