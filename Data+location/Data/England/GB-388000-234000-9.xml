		<content>    The{shop}used to be two cottages   
 but these were burnt down and the shop
 was built over them. Opposite the shop
 is the{school,}built in{1907.}Until   
 approximately{1930}it had no play-area
 so the children used the{green}for    
 their playground, which was quite safe
 because only one or two cars would use
 the road each day.                    
    The road went down to the{river    
 where the{ferry}was, which went across
 the river to{Bredon.}The ferry was    
 fairly big as it could hold a car. The
 cost of the ferry in old money was{5d 
 for a car,{2d}for you and your bicycle
 and{1d}for just yourself.             
    Where{Orchard Drive}is there used  
 to be an orchard belonging to{Warner's
{bus service,}from which nineteen tons 
 of damsons were picked each year.
