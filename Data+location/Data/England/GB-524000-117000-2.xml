		<content>   There are scattered farms, some     
 buildings date from the 14th century, 
 and are still constructed of "wattle  
 and daub". Other buildings are brick  
 and timber framed built in the        
 Georgian and Victorian periods, and   
 have been modernised. Other houses    
 have been built during the last fifty 
 years. Some houses are owner occupied,
 and some are owned by the Mid Sussex  
 District Council and are rented by the
 occupiers. Some of the farms are      
 farmed by the owners, and some are    
 farmed by tenants. Most of the "tied" 
 cottages, originally occupied by the  
 farm workers, are now privately owned 
 and have been modernised.             
   There are two churches, at Twineham 
 (O.S.252199) and Sayers Common (O.S.  
 268186) Twineham Church is early Tudor
 brick built, the other is Victorian   
 and is of flint and brick construction</content>
