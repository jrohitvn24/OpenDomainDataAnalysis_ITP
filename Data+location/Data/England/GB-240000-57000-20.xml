		<title>20TRANSPORT-PROPOSED TUNNEL</title>
		<content> DUE TO THE INCREASED{TRAFFIC          
{CONGESTION}IN SALTASH,THE LOCAL       
 AUTHORITIES HAVE PROPOSED BUILDING A  
{ROAD TUNNEL}UNDER SALTASH LINKING THE 
{TAMAR BRIDGE}WITH THE MAIN{A38}JUST   
 WEST OF SALTASH.HERE ARE THE VIEWS OF 
 SOME LOCAL RESIDENTS.                 
 "SOME PEOPLE LIVING NEAR THE ROAD     
 WILL BE UPSET BECAUSE OF THE NOISE."  
 "IT WILL MAKE IT EASIER AND QUICKER TO
 GET TO WORK BUT IT MIGHT LEAD TO LOTS 
 OF ACCIDENTS IN THE SUMMER."          
 "THE EXISTING BOTTLENECK IS GOING TO  
 MOVE FURTHER INTO CORNWALL AND IF     
 ANOTHER BOTTLENECK DOES APPEAR,WILL   
 THEY SUGGEST ANOTHER TUNNEL?"         
 "IN MY FAMILY EVERYBODY AGREES;THE NEW
 ROAD SERVES NO USEFUL PURPOSE.WHILE   
 THE BRIDGE REMAINS A TWO LANE SYSTEM  
 WITH TOLLS,IT CAN ONLY SERVE AS A     
 BOTTLENECK TO FAST FLOWING TRAFFIC IN 
 AND OUT OF CORNWALL."                 </content>
