		<title>14The Rector's Working Week.</title>
		<content>  During the week he spends his day    
visiting, or being consulted by, people
who need his help. He will visit people
chronically ill or who are in hospital.
The hospitals may be as far afield as  
Oxford or Amersham, though usually in  
High Wycombe or Henley. He always      
visits homes where there has been a    
death.                                 
  He prepares couples for marriage,    
expecting to see them five times before
the wedding. He holds confirmation     
classes, and visits the schools each   
week, giving lessons in the two Church 
Schools. He regularly consults with his
ten Churchwardens, attends five        
Parochial Church Council meetings every
two months, as well as Chapter meetings
which means travelling to High Wycombe 
or beyond.                             
  He will spend two or three hours     
preparing a five minute sermon.        </content>
