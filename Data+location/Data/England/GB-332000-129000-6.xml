		<content> There are very few new houses in our  
 area.Most of the houses are fairly old
 and near to the river.Many of them    
 have been modernised inside but on the
 outside they have kept the same type  
 of windows and doors so that they have
 retained their character.Some houses  
 have still got walls made of cob.Cob  
 is unbaked clay mixed with straw or   
 stones.Cob walls are very thick.      
 Builders are not allowed to use cob   
 nowadays.                             
 Houses are very expensive to buy.It   
 would cost at least Â£30,000 to buy a  
 cottage at Burrowbridge.Most people   
 borrow money from a Building Society  
 or a bank which they repay over a     
 period of up to 25 years.If you want  
 to buy or sell a house you contact an 
 Estate Agent whose job it is to       
 advertise and sell property.
