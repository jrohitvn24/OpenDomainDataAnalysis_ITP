		<content>   On 27th April 1985 we went to       
 Bovington to play six-a-side football.
 One of the girls brought along a teddy
 bear as a mascot. Bill, our football  
 coach, took us to the changing rooms  
 where we put on our kit and waited for
 play.                                 
   Our first game was against Herston  
 and we beat them 1-0. We were all very
 happy about winning the game. We then 
 played Sandford who were very good,   
 but we managed to beat them 2-0. By   
 now we felt very confident because we 
 only had to beat Corfe Castle to get  
 into the semi-finals. Luck stayed with
 us and we won again, 1-0.             
   We had to play Wareham in the       
 semi-finals and they were a very tough
 side. It was the hardest game we had  
 played so far in the competition, but 
 we beat them 2-0.
