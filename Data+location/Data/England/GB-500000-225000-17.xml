		<title>17ENTERTAINMENT-SCOUTS</title>
		<content> Every  Friday night  at 7.30 we  meet 
 at the 1st/3rd H/R scout H.Q. If it's 
 a hot night we go to the fields and   
 play some games. If not we stay inside
 the H.Q and do some scout work,for    
 example learning to read maps,learning
 to tie knots and lashings etc. Every  
 two weeks we go swimming at the Sports
 Centre,which is about a 7 minute walk 
 away. When we go into the H.Q we put  
 our bags down and pay our subs.,(20p).
 The subs.,go into scout funds to pay  
 for equipment etc. Then we put on our 
 uniform (green shirt,green beret,     
 mushroom coloured trousers, yellow and
 purple scarf, leather belt) and have  
 flag break(saluting the flag).Later   
 we take our uniform off and play some 
 games and then go onto some scout     
 work.At the end of the meeting we     
 lower the flag.We go home at about    
 8.30 often calling at the chip shop.  </content>
