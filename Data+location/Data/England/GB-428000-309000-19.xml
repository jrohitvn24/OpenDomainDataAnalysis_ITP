		<content>  In the{summer}we play{rounders}.We   
 get into two teams.One team fields and
 the others bat.There are four posts   
 someone throws the ball and the other 
 person tries to hit it.Then they run  
 from one post to the other if they get
 right round they get a{rounder.}The   
 only ways you can be out is caught out
 or stumped on the back or someone     
 stumps the post and you are run out.  
  In{winter}the boys play football and 
 the girls play{netball.}In{football   
 you have to kick the ball into a net. 
  In{netball}you have to throw the ball
 through a high hoop.The boys also play
 cricket in the summer.{Cricket}is a   
 bit like{rounders}where you hit the   
 ball with a bat.In the playground we  
 play{bulldog,train tick}and{line tick 
{which is where you tick}each other on 
 the back.
