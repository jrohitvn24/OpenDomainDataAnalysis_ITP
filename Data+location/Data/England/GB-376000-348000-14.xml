		<title>14SCHOOL MEALS SURVEY</title>
		<content>In our school we have recently changed 
our assembly hall into the dining room 
as well.This is because our old dining 
room has now been demolished.It used to
be the original part of the school and 
was built in 1849 but now the space has
been cleared so that we have a larger  
play area.We carried out a survey to   
see what people thought of the new     
dining room.Only 12.5% preferred the   
newdining area - 87.5% said they did   
notlike the new service.               
Most people did not like the new       
plastic trays to eat off,with separate 
compartments for different foods.Others
complained of a lack of variety in the 
food and that they were more expensive 
under the new system.Some said we      
should SCRAP IT ALTOGETHER !!!!
