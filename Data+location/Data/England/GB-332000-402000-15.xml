		<title>15THE CHURCH-INCE BLUNDELL</title>
		<content>    The village has strong Roman       
 Catholic traditions and the parish    
 church of the Holy Family has a       
 thriving congregation.  It is attached
 to{Ince Blundell Hall}and was given to
 the people of the village by the      
{Weld-Blundell}family.                 
   Before the Reformation, mass, for   
 this area, was celebrated at Sefton   
 Church, but after this Catholics had  
 to worship in secret.  During this    
 time mass was said in a barn built in 
 the shape of a cross, known to this   
 day as the{Cross Barn.} This has      
 recently been converted to a private  
 dwelling.                             
    Mass is celebrated every weekday   
 and three times on Sunday.  Special   
 services are held at Christmas,Easter 
 and Harvest time.  The Parish Priest  
 is Father Michael Kennedy.
