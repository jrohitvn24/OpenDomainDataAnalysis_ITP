		<title>15       FEAST WEEK</title>
		<content>    Village Feast Week holds something 
 for everyone.  This year, after a     
 Family Barbecue on the first Saturday 
 evening, many teams entered themselves
 for "It's a Knockout" on the Sunday,  
 when fun and friendship were the order
 of the day.                           
    Monday was Film Night, and the     
 W.I.Exhibition and Car Treasure Hunt  
 provided an enjoyable Tuesday Evening.
    Mini and Youth Club Discos,  a     
 Sponsored Bike Ride and an Art &amp; Craft
 Exhibition were followed on the Friday
 Evening by a concert at St. Andrew's  
 Church, when local musical talent was 
 brought together.                     
    The final day of Feast Week is     
 known as Gala Day, when the Playing   
 Field comes alive with games, raffles,
 competitions, Go-Kart racing, pony    
 rides and Displays. The P.T.A. Barn   
 Dance traditionally ends the week.    </content>
