		<title>09TRADE: Brampton Market</title>
		<content>  Brampton became a market town in 1252
 when a Market Charter was granted by  
 King Henry III. It has remained a     
 market town ever since and still holds
 a market in the market square every   
 Wednesday.                            
  There are on average about 15 stalls 
 selling such things as clothing, fruit
 and vegetables, shoes, sweets and     
 confectionary, toys, cheeses and      
 health foods, plants and fresh        
 fish.The local Women's Institute also 
 sells its produce there. The stall    
 holders travel to Brampton from       
 Carlisle, Penrith, Newcastle, Maryport
 and Gretna as well as the local area.
