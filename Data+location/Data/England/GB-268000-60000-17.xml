		<title>17Then &amp; Now- life in 1925 (5)</title>
		<content> We had a blacklead stove. What she    
 mostly used to cook would be a rabbit 
 stew; my husband then my young man    
 would bring her over a couple of      
 rabbits, a sheep's head &amp; perhaps a   
 breast of lamb- no best joint in our  
 day- you couldn't afford it.          
{Where did your water come from?}      
 We used to go down to the street- I   
 expect you've seen the rest of the tap
 there. We used to go up by Mrs        
 Tidball's and collect from there with 
 buckets.                              
{How did you keep food fresh?}         
 We'd have a safe, that is a little    
 wooden box with wire netting and if we
 had anything where we needed to keep  
 the flies off we'd pop it in there- no
 fridges or anything.
