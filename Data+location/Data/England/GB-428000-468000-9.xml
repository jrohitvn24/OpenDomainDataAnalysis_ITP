		<title>09Restoring Ripon's Canal.</title>
		<content>  {The Ripon Canal Society}is hoping to
 reopen the canal as far as the canal  
 basin near the centre of Ripon. The   
 society aims to restore the canal, all
 of its features and installations back
 to working order. This also means that
 efforts must be made to prevent any   
 more damage to any part of the canal  
 and its features. There are several   
 important historical features to be   
 preserved. The society hopes to       
 encourage people to use the canal for 
 recreation and pleasure.              
  The reopening of the canal will mean 
 renewed links for the middle of Ripon 
 with the River Ure and the Ouse       
 Navigation. The society is working    
 with the British Waterways Board to   
 provide what will be an important     
 attraction in the centre of Ripon. As 
 in many things, this will take time.
