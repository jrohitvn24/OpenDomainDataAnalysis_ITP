		<title>01Highbrook - rural Mid-Sussex</title>
		<content> This area of rural Mid-Sussex is      
 situated in the high weald and        
 consists mostly of steep wooded       
 valleys and pasture.It contains parts 
 of the parishes of West Hoathly and   
 Highbrook and of Horsted Keynes.It is 
 intersected by ridge roads running    
 roughly north/south and, for the south
 east of England is relatively sparsely
 populated. The largest concentration  
 is the hamlet of Highbrook, where     
 there is a church, a few houses but no
 shops or pubs. Otherwise there are    
 scattered groups of agricultural      
 cottages and a number of large        
 well-appointed houses. The pleasant   
 scenery and convenient location of    
 this affluent area make it attractive 
 to newcomers who derive their incomes 
 from elsewhere. Its most famous       
 feature is Horsted Keynes station on  
 the Bluebell preseved steam railway.  </content>
