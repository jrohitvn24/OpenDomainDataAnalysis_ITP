		<title>02The Canal at Deepcut</title>
		<content>   The{Basingstoke Canal}was one of the
 first opened in Southern England to be
 part of a national waterway between   
 the River Thames and the English and  
 British Channels. The canal which was 
 used for trade purposes, never went   
 beyond Basingstoke and was 59km long. 
   The cutting of the part of the canal
 which passes through Ash, Frimley,    
 Pirbright &amp; Woking was begun in 1788. 
 In a distance of 25km there is a rise 
 of 60m therefore 29 locks were built  
 which had to be big enough to allow   
 boats 22m long and 4m wide to pass.   
 The canal rose 30m by means of 14     
 locks within a 3km stretch to reach   
 the entrance of the great thousand    
 yard cutting 22m deep in places.      
   This area became known as{Deepcut.  
 In 1839 the London and South Western  
 Railway was completed from London to  
 Basingstoke.                          </content>
