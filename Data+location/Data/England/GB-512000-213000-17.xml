		<title>17What Harpenden Means to Me</title>
		<content> I am ten years old and I live in      
 Harpenden.  There are a lot of good   
 activites to choose from.  One of my  
 favourite things to do is to go for   
 long walks and I am lucky because     
 there is a field at the bottom of my  
 garden.  On Sunday you can go to      
 Sunday School. I go to the Salvation  
 Army but there are many more.  I often
 go to the library. I've got a library 
 card and I borrow lots of books.  In  
 the summer I go to a swimming club at 
 the open air pool in Harpenden. I have
 been going for two years and I think  
 my swimming has really improved.  I   
 use the play equipment in Rothamsted  
 Park quite a lot and enjoy myself     
 playing with my friends.  I like the  
 choice of activities at the Sports'   
 Centre. Last year I tried Archery.    
 Harpenden is a good place to live.
