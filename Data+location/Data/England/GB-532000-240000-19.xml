		<content>   There are lots of things to do for  
 people of all ages.                   
   A lot of children are brownies,cubs,
 guides or scouts.These meet in schools
 and so do the youth clubs.            
   People can play many sports:rugby,  
 football, cricket, hockey, badminton  
 and tennis. A B.M.X. track opened last
 year.In summer, many people go swim-  
 ming at the'Green plunge', which is an
 open air pool.In winter people go to  
 letchworth to swim.                   
   There is one cinema, which cinema _ 
 goers thought good value. The library 
 is on fish hill. The churches and he  
 community centre have clubs of differ-
 ent kinds.Most people we questroned   
 were  satisfied with the leisure      
 facilities, though some would like an 
 indoor pool, a riding school, ice and 
 roller-skating rinks and squash       
 courts.                               </content>
