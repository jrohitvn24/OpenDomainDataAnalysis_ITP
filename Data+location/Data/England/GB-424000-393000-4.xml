		<title>04Bradfield's Roads</title>
		<content> The roads in our area are all minor   
 roads.They are between 3 metres and 5 
 metres wide.Many have twists and      
 turns.Most  of them are steep.Some    
 have a gradient of 1 in 5.Quite a lot 
 of them have a gradient between 1 in 7
 and 1 in 5.There are no pavements .   
 Some roads have grassy verges, other  
 roads are bordered by stone walls     
 and/or drainage ditches. In many      
 places there is only enough room  for 
 one vehicle and because it is bendy it
 can be dangerous if you go too fast.  
 You also need to be careful because   
 tractors pulling farm machinery use   
 the roads.
