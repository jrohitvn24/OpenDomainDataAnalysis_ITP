 Old Erringham Farm, which has been in 
 existence since the 12th Century,     
 extends to 480 acres. A public        
 footpath runs through the farm, and   
 visitors are able to see Old Erringham
 Hall, the Norman Barn and the tiny    
 Chapel, all listed buildings.         
 The present tenant farmer has about   
 400 sheep, Southdown and Romney, and  
 the public are urged to keep their    
 dogs under control as he has lost     
 several sheep due to dog worrying.    
 He has 5 tractors and carries out all 
 the work himself with the help of 4   
 men. He cultivates 300 acres where he 
 grows cereals and green feed. He is   
 currently experimenting with a silage 
 machine and stores the silage in huge 
 plastic bags.
