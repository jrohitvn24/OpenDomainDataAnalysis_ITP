		<content> This block in the South Downs, is     
 extremely undulating with hills rising
 to 212 metres. The landscape is very  
 varied with frequently alternating    
 woodland and farmland and with wheat  
 grown up to the tops of the Downs. No 
 other crop except grass is grown.     
 There are no A or B class roads in the
 block; most roads are narrow and      
 winding, often between high earth     
 banks on both sides. Sutton and Bignor
 and the only nucleated settlements,   
 being less than 1 km apart and        
 standing on opposite sides of a       
 valley. Because of the isolation of   
 the block, there has been little new  
 housing development and there is an   
 almost total lack of amenities with   
 much dependence on private transport. 
 However, many older houses have been  
 rehabilitated and many timber framed  
 houses have survived.                 </content>
