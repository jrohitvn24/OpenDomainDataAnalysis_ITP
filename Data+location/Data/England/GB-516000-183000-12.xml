		<title>12Life Style : Local Library</title>
		<content>   I am member of Ealing Road library.I
 go to it nearly every 2 weeks.        
                                       
   In the Library there are rooms for  
 different age groups,I'm a member of  
 the junior group.                     
                                       
  There are all kinds of books like,   
 Science, Story, Dictionaries, Sport,  
 Nature and Science Fiction.I'm most   
 interested in Story and Nature books. 
                                       
  Before I go in the library I have to 
 give my membership card and sign in my
 books. There is a code machine which  
 reads the code inside the book and    
 checks to see if it is overdue. Nobody
 can take out more than six books.     
                                       
  In the school holidays the library   
 sometimes has exhibitions and special 
 events for children.                  </content>
