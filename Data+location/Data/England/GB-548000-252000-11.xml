		<content>   Wandlebury, once the country seat of
 Lord Godolphin, was bought by the     
 Cambridge Preservation Society in 1954
 to protect it from development. Once  
 an Iron Age Hill fort, one of the     
 ditches thet surrounded the village   
 can be seen on the top of the hill. Of
 53 acres of grass only half an acre of
 original grassland remains. All the   
 trees were planted. Over 90% of the   
 archaeological sites have been spoilt 
 by gardening and building. Ditches    
 were filled in and inner banks        
 removed. In 1975 it was designated a  
 "country park". Paths were put through
 trees and meadows attracting visitors.
   The tail of a Wellington bomber is  
 stuck high up in a beech tree, where  
 it crashed in fog in World War 2.     
   At the far end of the reserve is a  
 Roman road part of which is an SSSI   
 because of its rich chalk flora.      </content>
