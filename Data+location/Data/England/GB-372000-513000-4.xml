		<title>04Houses in Warcop &amp; Bleatarn</title>
		<content> Most houses in Warcop and Bleatarn are
 made of stone.Some are plain stone and
 some are covered with pebble dash.    
 This is when all the stone is covered 
 with cement.When this is dry pebbles  
 are stuck on.                         
    A few are modern buildings made    
 of brick and partly pebble dashed.    
 Out of 119 houses, 48 are terraced, 24
 are detached, 21 are semi-detached,   
 8 are council houses, 6 are bungalows 
 and 6 are farm houses; 3 houses are   
 used to give holiday makers a place   
 to stay with a bed to sleep in and    
 breakfast provided; 2 houses are let  
 to holiday makers who look after them 
 selves.There is only 1 public house,  
 "The Chamley Arms".                   
    Most people own their own house,   
 though some are tied cottages owned by
 farmers to let to their workers.
