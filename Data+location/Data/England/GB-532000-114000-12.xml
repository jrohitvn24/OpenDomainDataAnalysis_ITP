		<title>12Ditchling's Local News Media</title>
		<content> The Ditchling Dialogue is a lively    
 monthly magazine containing news of   
 local activities.This magazine started
 in neighbouring Hassocks but a long   
 time resident and lover of Ditchling  
 sponsored the extension of circulation
 to Ditchling and has arranged a       
 distribution plan which ensures that  
 at least 95% of the homes in Ditchling
 get the publication each month. The   
 objective was to provide a platform   
 for local opinion and items of local  
 interest including past history.The   
 magazine is distributed on a 'give_   
 away' basis and is paid for by a      
 multitude of local advertisements.    
 There is a parish magazine called     
 Ditchling Beacon which gives parochial
 news.There are two local weekly       
 newspapers,The Mid Sussex Times and   
 the Sussex Express.The first of these 
 at one time had a local correspondent.</content>
