		<content>  About 13% of the inhabitants were    
 actually born in Marnhull.19% come    
 from other parts of Dorset.Some were  
 born abroad,leaving 64% from other    
 parts of the British Isles.Apart from 
 those born in neighbouring counties,  
 a large number come from London and   
 the Home Counties,many to retire.     
  Of CHILDREN,the numbers born in and  
 outside Dorset are about the same,but 
 less than one third were born in      
 Marnhull.                             
  During the last 16 years a number of 
 small housing estates have been built 
 in Marnhull.The houses have been      
 bought by people from outside Marnhull
 thereby altering its demography.      
  CUBS,a boys'uniformed organisation,  
 meet every Wednesday.First we have the
 Grand Howl,flag break,register and    
 uniform inpection.Games or tracking   
 are followed by group activities.     </content>
