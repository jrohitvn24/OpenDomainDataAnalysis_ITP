		<title>17Milton Keynes Bowl,page 2</title>
		<content>   I went to a concert at the Milton   
 Keynes Bowl.It can hold 50,000        
 people sitting on the slopes          
 watching the events which take        
 place in the middle of the flat       
 area.There was a big screen where you 
 could see the singers face.           
   Thousands of people were inside but 
 outside there were 100's of people    
 watching the screen from nearby       
 hillsides.You could hear the music all
 over Bletchley.                       
   Policemen had to be drafted in from 
 all the surrounding areas to police   
 the traffic and the parking.Special   
 police have to mingle with the crowds 
 inside the Bowl so do members of the  
 drug squad.It costs a lot of money to 
 pay for this and the policemen also   
 have to be fed all day.
