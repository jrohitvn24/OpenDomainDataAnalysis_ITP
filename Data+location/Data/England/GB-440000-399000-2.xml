		<content> The{Brook Dyke}runs through Wath and  
 is polluted_mainly with rubbish. All  
 kinds of{rubbish}is thrown            
 in,including fridges,broken           
 bottles,springs and old mattresses.But
 inspite of the pollution things still 
 live there.Here are found snails and  
 worms pond skaters and water boatmen  
 and surprisingly enough three spined  
 sticklebacks.The source of this       
 pollution is people who live near the 
 dyke who can't be bothered to take    
 their rubbish to the dumpit site where
 they can be disposed of               
 properly,instead they throw it into   
 the stream and pollute it.Children who
 play down near the dyke help to       
 pollute it too by throwing their crisp
 bags and glass bottles in.Once Brook  
 Dyke was a lovely clean unpolluted    
 stream but now it is an eye sore and  
 it will probably never recover.       </content>
