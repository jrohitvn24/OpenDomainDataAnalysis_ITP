		<content>   The encroachment of the{River Ribble
 has guaranteed that remains of the    
 Roman fort have been exposed at       
 regular intervals,maintaining the     
 public's interest.In 79A.D.Ribchester 
 stood at the junction of the Roman    
 Road from Manchester via Carlisle to  
 Scotland and the route from York to a 
 West Coast base near Fleetwood.Today  
 it stands at the crossroads of the old
 and the new.                          
   Since the{Museum}opened in 1914     
 thousands of visitors have looked at  
 the village's Roman past and many more
 enjoyed an attractive little place    
 with an interesting Church,many old   
 buildings built with stone pillaged   
 from the Roman fort,a thriving woollen
 mill selling cloth and ready made     
 goods and pleasant pubs serving home  
 made food and good locally brewed ale.
