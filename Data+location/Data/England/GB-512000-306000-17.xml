		<content> The children carried out a survey of a
 cross_section of pupils at the school 
 to discover the incidence of housing  
 types.                                
 Of a survey of 40 houses:             
 16 were detached                      
 13 were semi-detached                 
 8 were bungalows                      
 3 were old cottages                   
 There were no terraced houses or      
 flats.                                
 Most houses were of a traditional     
 brick and tile construction with 3 or 
 4 bedrooms, central heating and a     
 telephone.  Most families had added a 
 conservatory or extension to their    
 homes.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
