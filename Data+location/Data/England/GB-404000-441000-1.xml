		<content>           SKIPPING                    
    There are an awful lot of rhymes or
 games that children play when         
 skipping.  Boys and girls both play   
 skipping.  Games may go on for up to  
 15 minutes.  Two of the favourite     
 rhymes are:                           
 KNICKER BOY                           
 I know a knicker boy,                 
 And he's double-jointed,              
 Gave me a kiss and made me            
                         disappointed, 
 Gave me another,                      
 To match the other,                   
 By gum(name) I'll tell your mother,   
 For kissing (name) down by the river, 
 How many kisses did you give him?     
 2,4,6,8, etc.(skipped quickly,peppers)
                                       
 ONCE YOU'RE IN                        
 Once yuo're in you can't get out,     
 Unless you touch the ground           </content>
