		<title>09NETHER ALDERLEY MILL</title>
		<content> Nether Alderley Mill is under National
 Trust care.It was built in 1290.The   
 mill machinery was replaced in the    
 1800s.The stream that drove the mill  
 was an exceptionally small one.The    
 Elizabethen millwrights overcame this 
 problem by building a large dam across
 the valley,the back of the mill making
 part of the wall.Between 1967 and 1970
 Dr Boucher rebuilt the mill.The mill  
 attracts 1000 people every year.The   
 cogs are made from apple wood and the 
 spine wheel is made from beech.There  
 is one custodian looking after it.    
 The reservoir was filled day and night
 by the stream. in the morning the dam 
 would be full for a period of eight   
 hours.There are two hundred tons of   
 stone on the roof.The beams are the   
 original ones.
