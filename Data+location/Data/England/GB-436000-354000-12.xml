 I am woken at 07:30 by the digital    
 alarm and have breakfast of cornflakes
 and tea. Then I get dressed and listen
 to the radio.My younger brother and I 
 walk to the bus-stop with my mum at   
 08:20 to catch the bus to school.     
 We play football until the bell rings 
 at 09:00 for lessons to start.I enjoy 
 maths, English and art and craft.At   
 lunch-time I eat sandwiches and then  
 play on the field with my friends.We  
 are often read a story before we go   
 home on the bus at 15:45.             
 At home I have sweets and a drink and 
 watch T.V.After tea I play with my    
 brother and we read. I enjoy Fighting 
 Fantasy books.Later we have coffee and
 biscuits before going to bed.
