		<title>01Introduction to Codsall</title>
		<content>The survey area is mainly rural,with   
built up areas concentrated in the SE  
round Codsall. The first mention of    
Codsall is in the Domesday Book which  
shows that it consisted of 3 hides held
by Chenvin,with land for three ploughs.
Today, the parish of Codsall,lying on  
the boundary of its own county,Stafford
shire and close to those of Shropshire 
and the West Midlands, has become a    
popular residential area, mainly for   
people working in Wolverhampton.Codsall
with an estimated population of 13,000 
lies about 4 miles north west of this  
large industrial town and is only just 
separated from it by a very narrow     
green belt. Thus, although the village 
is still partly rural, suburban W'ton  
appears to be gaining ground. Codsall  
is now something of an administrative  
centre, housing the offices of the     
South Staffordshire District Council.  </content>
