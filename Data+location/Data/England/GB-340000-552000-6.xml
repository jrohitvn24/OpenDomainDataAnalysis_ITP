    The latest fashion today is jeans, 
 baggy jumpers and bright socks. White 
 jackets and pastel shades are coming  
 into fashion. Colours like lemon,     
 mint, white, pink and blue are        
 popular. Fashions from the 1960's are 
 also coming back into fashion. Mini   
 skirts, stiletto heels, fishnet tights
 and fingerless gloves are favoured.   
    Most people like to look smart and 
 fashionable, but others prefer to look
 scruffy. We interviewed our teacher   
 Mr. Walker about fashion. He said some
 of it was very creative, and that most
 people prefer to be casually dressed  
 in comfortable clothes.               
    We can only wonder what fashion    
 will be like in ten or a hundred years
 time.
