		<title>14Fire at Great Billing School</title>
		<content>On February 20th 1985 Great Billing    
Lower School was set on fire by 3      
teenagers aged 13,14 and 15. Two       
classrooms were completely destroyed   
and damage amounted to $30,000. The    
140 pupils had to be re-housed in Far  
Cotton  Middle School while repairs    
took place. The boys used turpentine   
to start the fire and admitted causing 
the blaze to get rid of their finger-  
prints. They had broken into the School
earlier and had stolen 3 cassette      
players and other items. Three fire    
engines fought the blaze for three     
hours before it was under control.
