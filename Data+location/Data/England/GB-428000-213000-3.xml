		<content>A Saturday. (cont.)                    
It is normally cabbage pie. We don't   
have puddings. At 8.00pm I go to bed,  
at 8.30pm Mum reads me a story. It is  
called "Midnight is a Place", by Joan  
Aitken, then I read till 9.00pm. I am  
not a very good sleeper. I go to sleep 
at about 9.45pm. I normally dream about
horses.

A  Wednesday.                          
        It only takes a few minutes to 
get to school. I sit and chat to my    
friends until the bell goes at 9 am,   
then we sit down for the register. We  
line up for assembly, the recorder     
players get their recorders, a boy puts
the record on and the juniors come in, 
closely followed by the infants. Mr    
Smith, our vicar, talks about Jesus and
God,we sing a hymn and say our prayers.</content>
