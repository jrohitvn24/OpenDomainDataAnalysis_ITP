		<title>05Mr. Morgan -The Shepherd.</title>
		<content>   An average sheep lives up to 5 or 6 
 years. The oldest sheep is 6 years    
 old. Mr. Morgan said that if you had  
 1 sheep for a pet and feed it well    
 every day, it would live for about 15 
 years. But at the farm they cannot    
 afford to keep every sheep as a pet!! 
   They sell the sheep,lamb and rams,  
 but sometimes they get stolen.Mr.     
 Morgan said there was no way of       
 telling 1 sheep from another, but he  
 just got used to them because they are
 just like humans; they have their     
 little diffrences.                    
   If different breeds of sheep are put
 together ,they sometimes have problems
 with breeding. Mr. Morgan has 5 sheep 
 dogs and he trains most of them       
 himself.Female sheep dogs are easier  
 to train than males.
