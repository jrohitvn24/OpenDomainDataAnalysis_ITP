		<content> (The Calderdale Way,)which was opened 
 in 1978, is a fifty mile walk using   
 mainly footpaths and tracks round the 
 boundary of Calderdale. In 1974       
 Calderdale Metropolitan Borough       
 Council was formed. Local people      
 didn't like this, they thought it was 
 too large. A group of people planned a
 walk that was special to the new area 
 to help improve attitudes.            
  During the year it is possible to see
 (26 species of birds, 12 species of   
 (trees, over 100 plants) plus shrubs  
 and weeds.Some people who live near   
 the footpaths have started( Bed and   
 (Breakfast) businesses to help        
 vistitors walk the complete way.      
 Strangers think  Calderdale is dirty  
 and industrial but the Calderdale way 
 proves(Calderdale is beautiful.
