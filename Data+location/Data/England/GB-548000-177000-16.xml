		<content>  Much of today's leisure time for     
 both adults and children is spent in  
 watching television. With video       
 machines and video films increasing in
 popularity, many families are inclined
 to stay at home rather than go out! It
 can be more economic for a family to  
 hire a video film than to go to the   
 cinema.                               
  In recent years there has been a     
 great interest in keeping fit and     
 healthy. "We", the public are         
 encouraged to exercise and are advised
 to eat the 'right' things. The media  
 tell us what is good for or harmful to
 us.                                   
  Local churches provide spiritual and 
 social activities for their           
 parishoners.                          
  Many children have their own home    
 computers, and electronic toys are    
 popular.                              </content>
