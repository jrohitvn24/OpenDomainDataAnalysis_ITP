		<content> Many families participate in village  
 events, creating a sense of community.
 Many activities are centered in the   
 village hall which was built with     
 money raised by the residents.        
 There is an active Sunday School and a
 small regular church congregation     
 which keeps the church clean and      
 beautifully decorated with flowers.   
 More attend Christian festivals and   
 care about the fabric of the historic 
 building.                             
 The village provides little work, no  
 school, shop, post office, doctor or  
 public house. Most families possess a 
 car and travel to nearby towns for    
 these services, and also the theatre, 
 cinema and sports facilities.         
 Most families have made a positive    
 choice to live in the quiet of the    
 countryside and are content with the  
 shortcomings of the life.             </content>
