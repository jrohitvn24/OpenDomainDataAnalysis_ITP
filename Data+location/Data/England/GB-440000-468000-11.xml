		<title>11CHANGES IN VILLAGE LIFE</title>
		<content>    We asked some of the inhabitants   
 who have lived here for thirty to     
 forty years how the village has       
 changed.                              
    The village has seen more changes  
 in the last ten years than in any     
 other decade.  There are many more    
 people and the community is now mixed,
 though many think it is still an      
 agricultural village.   Many new      
 houses have been built and many are   
 proposed.   There are six new building
 sites some about to start and some in 
 full swing.   The pubs have declined  
 in number.                            
    The village is noisier now due to  
 trainees' aircraft and the vehicles   
 which pass through or belong to the   
 village.
