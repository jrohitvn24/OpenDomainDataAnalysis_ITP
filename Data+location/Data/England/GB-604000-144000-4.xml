 The village sewage goes to the pumping
 station and some goes straight to the 
 sewage works.If it all went to sewage 
 works it would over flow because it is
 too much.First it starts at the       
 storage tank.Then it gradually goes to
 the sedimentation tank which gets all 
 the sludge out of the water.The       
 sedimentation tanks are up side down  
 pyramid shape with a square on top.The
 filters are two round circles joined  
 together.There are four long poles    
 going round.They drop the water coming
 from the sedimentation tanks.The      
 filters are filled up with stones and 
 worms.The stones stop the bacteria    
 from going to the humus tanks.By then 
  it is almost clean.Next to the humus 
 tanks is a shed.In the shed they keep 
 all their tools.Also they control the 
 whole of the sewage works.            </content>
