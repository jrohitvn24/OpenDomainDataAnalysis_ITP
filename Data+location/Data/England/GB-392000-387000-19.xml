		<title>19The River Goyt.</title>
		<content>     The woods of{Offerton}have a river
 running through them called{The Goyt. 
     For more tham twenty years the    
 river has been polluted.{The Stockport
{Federation of Anglers}have done mush  
 work to clean it up and have released 
 several thousand into the waters.Many 
 of them have died because the problem 
 of pollution has not yet been         
 overcome.                             
     The river should be a nice place  
 where famnilies can go and have a     
 picnic.                               
     There are lots of{small waterfalls
 and in the banks are the{nests}of many
 species of birds.                     
     Now we think that people will help
 to make the area more pleasant because
 there is more awareness of the        
 problems caused by pollution and it is
 hoped to clear the river by{1999.
