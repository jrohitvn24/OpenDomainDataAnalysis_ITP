		<content> Most people living in and around      
 Stokeinteignhead and Combeinteignhead 
 are employed in the nearby towns of   
 Newton Abbot, Torquay, Teignmouth, or 
 further away in Exeter. Very few      
 people work in the villages themselves
 or in agriculture. The local farms are
 mainly mixed and are labour intensive 
 and usually worked by the families    
 themselves although there is a demand 
 for seasonal workers particularly at  
 harvest time. Some locals work part   
 time in service trades, viz pubs,     
 restaurants, hotels etc. Both villages
 have many unemployed and also an      
 increasing number of retired people.
