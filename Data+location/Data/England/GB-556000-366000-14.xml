		<title>14The Village Policeman</title>
		<content> The resident village policeman is P.C.
 Whitehead.He is the only policeman in 
 the winter.In the summer there are 2  
 on duty and sometimes 3.The reason is 
 because there are more crimes in      
 summer when there are over 7,500 extra
 people on 65 caravan sites.On Bank    
 Holidays there is a patrol van half   
 way down Sea Lane.In it are a sergeant
 and 10 men in case there is any       
 fighting.Usually we get families but  
 sometimes we get skin-heads or gangs. 
 P.C.Whitehead works along with        
 Butlin's Security Officers and the    
 Beach Inspectors.In summer he goes    
 round the market looking for pick-    
 pockets and round the arcades for     
 people fiddling machines.At night he  
 deals with drunks and fights near pubs
 and night-clubs.He also searches for  
 lost children and property.In winter  
 the most common crime is theft.       </content>
