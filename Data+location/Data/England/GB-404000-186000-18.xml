		<title>18Teenage life in Pavenhill</title>
		<content> A 17 year old from Pavenhill gave this
 information:-                         
    He had lived in Purton from the age
 of one. He was educated in Purton and 
 was now studying at the NEW College in
 Swindon. He hoped to go to university 
 to study software engineering. He was 
 prepared to move to a different part  
 of the country to gain employment.    
    His social activities were         
 ice-skating at the newly opened Link  
 Centre in West Swindon, going to a    
 computer club and helping out on a    
 farm. He enjoyed listening to a range 
 of music from some classics to        
 electronic music.                     
    For transport he used a bus or was 
 driven by parents or friends.         
    He preferred village life to living
 in a town.
