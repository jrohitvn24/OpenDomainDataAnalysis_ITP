		<content> Mr. Schofield has two sheep sheds, one
 is a sheep handling shed and the other
 shed is where they keep the sheep in  
 the winter and for lambing.           
 There are two cow sheds. One is where 
 the heifers go in for the winter, the 
 other is for the cows to go in during 
 the winter.                           
 There is also a hay shed where they   
 keep the odd bales of hay.            
 Both sheep sheds are modern but the   
 heifers shed is old.                  
 Mr. Schofield has two tractors for    
 pulling anything. He has two trailers 
 for putting hay or straw and things   
 that you can't carry on. He has a hay 
 bob for turning the hay, one silage   
 cutter for cutting the grass, two     
 rollers for rolling the ground and a  
 baler for baling the hay. He has a    
 farm bike for going to look at his    
 stock and a Toyota pick up truck.     </content>
