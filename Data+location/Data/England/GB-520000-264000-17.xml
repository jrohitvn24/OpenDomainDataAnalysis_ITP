		<content> There are three churches in the       
 Offords in 1985.One is a Baptist      
 Church,a small red brick building on  
 the main street.The other two are     
 Church of England buildings -the      
 Church of St.Peter in Offord D'Arcy is
 no longer used but is maintained and  
 cared for even though it is           
 redunant.It is a beautiful stone and  
 flint building with a spire,set in    
 attractive grounds,such a pity that it
 should be empty and locked.The other  
 church which is used regularly for    
 worship is All Saints Church in Offord
 D'Arcy.This church has a tower and is 
 situated beside the village hall.It's 
 vicar,The Reverend Dr.Pryke has       
 recently retired and so there is no   
 permanent vicar in this parish at     
 present.
