		<title>11HISTORY OF NENTHEAD</title>
		<content> Nenthead does not appear on Speed's   
 map of 1610, although there would be  
 homesteads in the area at that time.  
 Lead was mined from 1181, but the     
 industry did not flourish until the   
 end of the seventeenth century.       
  The London Lead Co.&lt;Quaker> began    
 buying lead in 1705 and in 1750 took  
 up leases  on all local properties.In 
 1753 the company designed and built a 
 a new village Nenthead.It had houses  
 built for smelters and officials of   
 the Nenthead Mills .Most of the miners
 lodged at small farms and cottages    
 around it.The Company improved farms  
 and provided good education for       
 miner's children.In 1914 135 children 
 were attending school.The Brownley    
 Hill Mine was fully operational,      
 minerals being brought from the mine  
 by horse and wagon,transferred to an  
 engine and went to the washing floor. </content>
