		<title>08ANNUAL CUSTOMS IN BUNNY</title>
		<content> Many of the old customs once held in  
 Bunny have died out. However, an old  
 custom new to Bunny is the{Shrove     
{Tuesday Pancake Race.}It is held in   
 Main Street. Girls, boys and adults   
 take part in the race. They run down  
 the street to the finishing line and  
 there the winners get a prize.        
 The{Strawberry Fayre}is held in July  
 every year when the Strawberries are  
 ripe. Strawberries and cream are      
 served for tea and everyone can play  
 games and buy produce and secondhand  
 goods. Another new event is the annual
{Fun Run}organised by the Rancliffe    
 Arms sports and social club. All ages 
 from Bunny and Bradmore run in a 3.5  
 miles race around Bunny Park. On the  
 31st. October a{Hallowe'en Party}is   
 held for children who dress as ghosts 
 and witches. They play many games like
 'apple bobbing' and 'trick or treat'. </content>
