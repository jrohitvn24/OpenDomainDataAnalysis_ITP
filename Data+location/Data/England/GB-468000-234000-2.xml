		<content> The Buckingham Community Centre is one
 of the town's newest buildings,having 
 been completed in 1984.               
 In a special survey,4 out of the 9    
 people questioned did attend the      
 Community Centre. Those who did not   
 said that they did not live locally,  
 or that they were new to the area, or 
 that they did not know what was       
 happening there. The Centre is used as
 a children's surgery,coffee morning   
 centre,playhouse,'Seesaw Club' meeting
 place,University Examination centre   
 and general 'Village Hall' for wedding
 receptions etc.                       
 3 people thought that it could offer  
 more,whilst the other 6 were quite    
 satisfied and thought it was a good   
 idea. All 9 people thought that it had
 been built in the best possible place.
