		<content> The area around Rosedale has some very
 fine{scenery.}The moors are most      
 attractive when the heather and       
 ling is in bloom late in August and   
 into September. The deep russet of the
 dead bracken and the orange and yellow
 of the leaves in Autumn contrasts     
 with the green of the valley.         
 There are many attractive and         
 impressive{trees,}notably the copper  
 beeches and the three sequoia.Many    
 different trees line the{river}banks. 
 Northdale Beck joins the Seven River  
 (arising from 7 springs)at the Bow    
 Bridge. The hills once abounded with  
{iron ore}and for years Rosedale was   
 celebrated for it's rich and extensive
 deposits of magnetic ore.             
{Grouse and pheasant}supply good sport 
 for the guns in the season. The stone 
 shooting butts are a feature of the   
 moor.                                 </content>
