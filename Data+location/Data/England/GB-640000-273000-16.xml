		<title>16Families - Holly</title>
		<content>My name is Holly Kim Gunton and I have 
a cat called Pickles. I live in a new  
farmhouse that my Dad built, it is     
called Vale Farm. The old one was      
burned down. My Mum is called Yvonne   
and my Dad is called Terry. I have not 
got any brothers or sisters. I am 8    
years old and I was born in Ipswich and
we lived in Laxfield before we came to 
Wenhaston.                             
I like school very much. My teacher's  
name is Mr. Marshall. He is the        
headmaster.                            
I am learning to play the violin with  
Mrs. Jenner. I go to lessons in        
Lowestoft on Saturday mornings. I      
sometimes take part in concerts.       
I like reading, especially Enid Blyton 
stories. I like toys and my favourite  
one is my doll which turns its head    
and is called Nina.
