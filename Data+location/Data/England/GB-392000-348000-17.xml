  Around Bagnall it is common knowledge
that the air is clean and pure.Several 
of the residents we interviewed told   
us that they had moved to Bagnall      
because of the air.                    
  The air is so pure because of the    
height of the land and also there is   
not alot of traffic and there are no   
smoking factory chimneys.              
  The special school Westwood Manor    
was situated in the area because of the
clean atmosphere and the abundant      
wildlife.                              
  The main problem in living in        
this area is for sufferers of          
conditions like Hay Fever.
