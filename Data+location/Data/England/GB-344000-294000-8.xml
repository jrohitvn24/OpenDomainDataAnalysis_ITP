 village with a shop that sells every  
 thing including frozen food, meat,    
 vegetables, fruit, household goods    
 and sweets. It is also a post office. 
   There is a nice hotel which is      
 used a lot. The hotel was built in    
 1838. There is a pub called the Yew   
 Tree Inn. The pub is also old, built  
 in 1720 and the people are friendly.  
   There is a tremendous community     
 spirit in the village. Everyone seems 
 anxious to work together for the good 
 of all. Newcomers are welcomed and    
 quickly belong. There is a Good       
 Neighbour Scheme to help the elderly. 
 The All Stretton Society is concerned 
 with conservation in the area, and The
 Commoner's Association looks after    
 rights. The All Stretton Records      
 Trust keeps an on-going record of any 
 antiquities in the village.           </content>
