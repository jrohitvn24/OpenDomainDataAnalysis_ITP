		<content>   Definitive{Black Country.}An area   
 which expanded hugely during the      
{Industrial Revolution}and now shows   
 more of its scars than its benefits.  
 Still considerable evidence of mining 
 subsidence throughout the 4 x 3 Km    
 block and a few holes from 18C &amp; 19C  
{delving}for coal, limestone and ore.  
   Much of the standing water which has
 formed in such holes is hard and      
 alkaline. Some of this water has      
 traces of phosphates and man-made     
 fibres and very little, or in some    
 cases no, insect life. Insect life is 
 now returning to the{River Tame,}which
 has been cleaned up in the last 10yrs.
 Many of the industrial sites have been
 demolished very quickly after closure 
 and the area colonised by buttercups  
 and nettles. These areas now show good
 numbers of Rodents, Sparrows, Martins 
 and Kestrels.                         </content>
