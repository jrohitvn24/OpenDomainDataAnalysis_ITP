		<title>05WALL ROMAN SITE.</title>
		<content>   Letocetum, the small Romano-British 
settlement at Wall, Staffordshire, lies
on the old Roman Imperial route,Watling
St., which ran from London to Wroxeter 
branching off to Chester. Along the    
Imperial routes posting stations were  
set up where horses could be changed   
and overnight lodging obtained. Wall   
was one of these stations and appears  
to have been a large settlement with   
substantial buildings. A bathhouse and 
the remains of a large mansion are     
visible with excavations still being   
carried out by the Staffordshire       
Archaeological Society. During early   
excavations numerous cremation burials 
were discovered along Watling St. to   
the West of Wall; several of the       
vessels are on display in the site     
museum together with other artefacts   
found on the site. The site is owned   
by the National Trust.                 </content>
