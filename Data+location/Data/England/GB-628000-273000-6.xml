		<content> Chippenhall Green, Fressingfield, is a
 forty acre common, believed never to  
 have been cultivated. It is at present
 grazed by cattle and horses from May  
 to October.The common supports        
 possibly the largest colony of green  
 winged orchids in the British Isles.  
 They are helped to survive by the     
 Suffolk Trust for Nature Conservation 
 who each summer send a party of       
 volunteers and recruits from the      
 Manpower Services Commission to remove
 thistles etc, the spread of which     
 threatens the orchids and against     
 which it is obviously impossible to   
 spray. During late Autumn, Liberty Cap
 toadstools are to be found, which,    
 when dried, give a similar effect to  
 hallucinogenic drugs such as L.S.D. We
 have other small areas where wild     
 flowers are conserved, ie the bee     
 orchid,ragged robin and wild campanula</content>
