		<title>06THE RAILWAY AT KNOTTINGLEY.</title>
		<content> Knottingley is on the Leeds Goole     
 railway line.The steel rails lie  on  
 concrete sleepers and the sleepers sit
 on ballast.Lights control the         
 trains.These work like traffic lights 
 using the same colours. The trains are
 diesel trains. Most of the goods      
 trains carry coal from the local pits 
 to the local power stations.The       
 railway  station consists of two      
 wooden platforms and a bridge to cross
 the lines.There is a small shelter on 
 one of the platforms.Daily there are  
 12 passenger trains to Leeds and 5 to 
 Goole.The journey to Leeds takes      
 41mins and to Goole 33mins.The        
 passenger trains are called Pay Trains
 because you pay the guard when you get
 on the trains.
