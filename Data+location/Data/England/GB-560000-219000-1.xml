		<title>01Welcome to Great Dunmow</title>
		<content>   Our survey area includes most of    
 Great Dunmow and the nearby land to   
 the South.  Dunmow is a small town in 
 North West Essex with a population of 
 just over 5000. The town is a mixture 
 of old and new with modern housing and
 industry blending well with buildings 
 several centuries old. However, it is 
 for the famous Flitch ceremony that   
 Dunmow is probably best known.        
   As most of Dunmow's surrounding area
 consists of high grade arable land, we
 have studied some important aspects of
 modern farming.  The growth in farming
 prosperity has been accompanied by    
 changes in transport and industry.    
   Whilst such changes are inevitable, 
 a visitor to the area would be        
 delighted by the careful attention to 
 planning policy that has produced such
 a pleasant environment in which to    
 live and work.                        </content>
