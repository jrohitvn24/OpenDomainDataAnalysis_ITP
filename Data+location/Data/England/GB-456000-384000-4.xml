		<content> Ours is a{rural area.}There are many  
 farms in our{area}where  few people   
 work.Many of the people in our block  
 work somewhere other than the village 
 they live in.From{Wallingwells        
 most people work in  Carlton.From     
{Carlton}most people work in the near  
 by towns of{Worksop}or Retford.Some   
 people work in{industrial estate}up   
 Lawn Road in Carlton.The estate is    
 small and only has twelve firms.They  
 produce{marble, metal,stone and       
{materials for building.}Some{factories
 only employ ten people.Many miners    
 live in Carlton,because there used to 
 be a colliery called{Firbeck}pit which
 has been closed down.Most of the      
 miners were moved to other pits.When  
 people in a village work elsewhere it 
 is called a{Dormer}Village.Letwell is 
 a good  example because{7 out of 10   
{villagers}work outside Letwell.       </content>
