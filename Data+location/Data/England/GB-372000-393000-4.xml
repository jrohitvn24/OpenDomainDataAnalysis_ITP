		<title>04URMSTON MEADOWS</title>
		<content> The meadows in Urmston is a place     
 where people take their motorbikes to 
 scramble because of the rough terrain.
 I sometimes go on my BMX to play.     
 There are a lot of trees to climb and 
 small beaches by the Mersey where we  
 throw stones to the other side or make
 small rafts and follow them down the  
 river. Every so often parts of the    
 bank break away and fall into the     
 Mersey. There is a fair bit of        
 wildlife on the meadows, like         
 birds,rabbits and bees,attracted to   
 the wild flowers.                     
  People like to play on the golf      
 course which is here and horse-riding 
 is popular as there are many farms    
 where the horses are looked after.
