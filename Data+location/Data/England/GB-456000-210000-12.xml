		<title>12BECKLEY SCHOOL - BUILDINGS</title>
		<content>The oldest part of the school is the   
hall built in 1895 which was originally
two classrooms but is now used for     
morning assembly, drama, P.E. and      
singing, etc. In 1974 a kitchen was    
added to the hall and about 50% of the 
children have a hot meal at midday. The
others bring sandwiches. Meals are     
eaten in the hall. On the other side of
the playground are the classrooms built
in 1968 and 1974. There is also a      
headmaster's study and a staffroom.    
Alongside the playground is the former 
toilet building, now used as a P.E.    
store and workshop, and a shelter to   
house the school mini-bus, a Morris    
Sherpa. Behind the fence is the school 
heated swimming-pool and changing rooms
erected by parents in 1985.
