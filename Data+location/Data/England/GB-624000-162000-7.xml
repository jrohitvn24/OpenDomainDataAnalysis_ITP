		<content> A part of the historic village of {   
{Sarre}falls within this survey. In    
 particular the site of the last ferry 
 across the Wantsum and of the first   
 bridge to be built, sometimes in the  
 15th Century.{Bridge Cottage}mark the 
 spot. No Roman remains have been found
 but Sarre in the obvious spot for a { 
{Roman Ferrey,}as it is opposite the   
 end of the Roman Road leading to      
 Canterbury. Sarre was important port  
 and settlement in Saxon days, as      
 witness its large and rich cemetery   
 discovered in 1864. In{Medieval}times 
 Sarre was still a part and had a large
 church, St Gile's now only a          
 foundation  beneath a field. By the   
 Reign of Henry VIII the Wantsum       
 Channel had shrunk to the proportions 
 of a river,but a shipwreck is         
 mentioned.The"Cherry Brandy" House was
 favoured by{Dickens.                  </content>
