		<content> A survey of the population in the area
 indicated that a large percentage were
 born outside Nottinghamshire, over    
 33%. Indeed, more people were born    
 outside the county than were born in  
 the village itself. Within England the
 places of origin include significant  
 numbers from the mainly mining areas  
 of Derbyshire, South Yorkshire and    
 Durham but also a sprinkling of people
 born as far afield as Northumberland  
 and Devon. As well as England a small 
 number were born in Scotland, Wales   
 and N.I., there are also immigrants   
 from Poland, Austria, Switzerland and 
 West Germany. The numbers of each sex 
 within our survey showed that there   
 were more females than males in all   
 age groups, indeed overall there are  
 20% more females than males. Within   
 the age groups it was found that over 
 25% were under 17 and 5% were over 65.</content>
