		<content>Thame Sports and Arts Centre was opened
in 1982  at a cost of half a million   
pounds. It is sited at Lord William's  
school, the facilities being shared    
between the school and the local       
community. Out of school hours it is   
open to the public thus ensuring very  
full use. Many special activities are  
available at holiday time, the most    
recent being the roller discos, a very 
popular feature.                       
Amongst the sport on offer are tennis, 
football, badminton, dance and martial 
arts. The centre is also used for      
assemblies, receptions, dance          
exhibitions and plays, being fully     
utilised during our town festival.     
There are 2 halls, changing rooms, a   
reception area and viewing area.The 3  
full time instructors produce a full   
variety of courses. The people of Thame
are looking forward to a swimming pool.</content>
