		<content>  The area lies to the West of         
 Chichester,below the{South Downs}and  
 extending almost to the{Solent        
 Coast.It is a rural area with a       
 large number and variety of farms.A   
 distinctive feature is the flatness of
 this coastal plain.                   
   There are several residential areas 
{-small villages}and housing           
 development along the main South Coast
 road.There are also a number of       
 isolated farming communities with     
 houses of historic interest.          
{ Public transport}is limited          
 particularly in the North of the area.
  There are few shops and only one Post
 Office.                               
   The traditional employment of       
 working on the land has now been      
 replaced by work in neighbouring towns
 in business and industry.{By pupils at
