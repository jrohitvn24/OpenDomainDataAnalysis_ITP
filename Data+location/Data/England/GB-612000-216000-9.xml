 has 20 sows and 40 stores,altogether  
 he keeps 60 pigs. This year 100       
 piglets were born. The farm was bought
 40 years ago by Mr.Ford. He moved to  
 this area because he liked this       
 district and always wanted to have his
 own farm. Mr. Ford has some tractors  
 and trailers and other machinrs to    
 help him run the farm. He is a        
 pleasant man to speak to and he has   
 lots of work to do on the farm.There  
 was some grain in the barn which he   
 uses as feed.The piglets are in a shed
 with their mother and their father,the
 boar,is in another shed.He also grows 
 some crops including oil-seed rape and
 potatoes.The farm is big and includes 
 50 fields.It is both a pig farm and   
 crop farm.
