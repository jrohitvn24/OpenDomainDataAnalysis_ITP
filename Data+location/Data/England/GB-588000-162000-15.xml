		<title>15MILTON CREEK</title>
		<content> The creek is round about two miles    
 long.There is very little traffic on  
 the creek now.Silt at the bottom of   
 the creek makes it smell.The creek is 
 very dirty because it is not used so  
 it stagnates and the chemicals from   
 Bowaters make it smell.In the creek   
 there is mostly mud and in the mud    
 there are mud fish.                   
{Milton creek rescue operation trust   
 was set up on June 5th 1985.They plan 
 to clear the creek of rubbish using   
 voluntary organisations if possible,  
 consult land owners and local groups  
 such as the Medway port authority     
 about possible developments,          
 especially for recreational purposes  
 and perhaps for commercial use        
{Dolphin Barge Museum}which shows the  
 history of the barges and the creek,  
 opens on Bank holidays and on Sundays.
