 Saffron Walden is a pleasant place to 
 live. We have nice homes and pleasant 
 friends. Our parents say the schools  
 are good. However it would be nice if 
 there was a cinema in the town. The   
 nearest is in Cambridge. There is a   
 bus once an hour to the town from our 
 estate. There is not a lot to do in   
 the town. Our older brothers and      
 sisters can go to the pub. The new    
 Leisure Centre is good but it can get 
 crowded. We need somewhere like a     
 youth club to just get together with  
 our friends.
