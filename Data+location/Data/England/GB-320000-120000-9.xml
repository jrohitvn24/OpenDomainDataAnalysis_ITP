		<content> Mechanisation has reduced the number  
 of labourers and labourers cottages   
 some of the cottages having been      
 converted into machinery sheds.Most   
 farms are now well equipped with      
 tractors and and wide variety of      
 spraying attachments which either     
 dispense fertiliser or pesticide.     
                                       
 Generally farming is a prosperous     
 activity and the monthly cheque from  
 the Milk Marketing Board has been the 
 foundation of this prosperity for the 
 past twenty years or so.However with  
 the new quotas on milk production     
 imposed by the E.E.C. future financial
 stability may be harder to            
 achieve.Perhaps new crops will have to
 be tried.One group of farmers nearby  
 to this area have already successfully
 started to produce bulbs for export to
 Holland!                              </content>
