		<title>10CRAWLEY HIGH STREET</title>
		<content> The{London-Brighton turnpike}gave us  
 the High Street, and the railway      
 helped extend it south. C20th traffic 
 jams eased in 1939 with a{by-pass.}The
 road today is choked with town centre 
 traffic, moving slowly past level     
 crossing, roundabout, pedestrians and 
 traffic lights. Width changes mark the
 old{Green}and{Square}(fairs held until
 1920's) but a central building is no  
 more. The station has moved east but  
 hotels and inns stand as reminders of 
 former transport. Medieval and later  
 houses mix uneasily with, or hide     
 under, modern exteriors of banks,     
 entertainment and glass fronts in a   
 mixed streetscape. the street now has 
 a fringe role to play in the C.B.D.   
 Once varied shops are now offices,    
 fast food outlets, computer sales etc,
 but the High Street is far from dead  
 as it continues to respond to needs.  </content>
