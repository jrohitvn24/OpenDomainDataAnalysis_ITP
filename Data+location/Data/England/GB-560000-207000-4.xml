		<content>       There is a lot of Farm Machinery
 in the area because there is a lot of 
 farming. There are several{Combine    
{Harvesters}because most land is used  
 for growing crops such as Barley, Oats
 Wheat and Oil seed rape. They cut down
 the{CORN}. Inside the Combine         
 Harvester the stalks are taken off the
 plants and that drops out of the back.
 That straw is later bailed by a bailer
 and used for animals to sleep on. Then
 the ears of wheat are threshed. When  
 the Combine Harvester is full a       
 tractor with a trailer on the back    
 comes beside it and a funnel comes out
 and the grain is blown out into the   
 trailer.                              
      {Tractors}are used on the farms. 
 They pull ploughs, fertiliser sprays, 
 trailers, bailers and many other      
 things.                               
       Tractors cost about Â£20,000.    </content>
