		<content>    This block is situated at the      
 junction of the S.Shrops. Hills with  
 the N.Shrops.Plain.                   
    A view of the area from the ridge  
 at Little Lyth (O.S. 477071_photo A)  
 reveals the railway line from         
{Shrewsbury}to{Hereford}and the{A49    
 running N/S along the foot of the     
 ridge through the western end of the  
 section.This busy road neatly bisects 
 the village of{Bayston Hill}(photo B),
 cutting off the older settlement to   
 the east from the modern housing      
 estates to the west.                  
    Beyond this the landscape rolls    
 away,showing typical glacial deposits 
 of sand and gravel,containing in its  
 hollows the 3 small meres{Bomere,}    
{Shomere}and{Betton Pool.}             
    The farming is largely arable      
 although some sheep and cattle are    
 kept as well.                         </content>
