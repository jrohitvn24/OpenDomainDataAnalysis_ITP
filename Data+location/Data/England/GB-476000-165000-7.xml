		<content> Before Arborfield Garrison was built  
 the land was part of Bearwood         
 Estate,which was owned by Mr          
 Walters.In 1904 the army decided to   
 build a Remount depot at Arborfield   
 Cross where they could trainand look  
 after many horses. There were many    
 farms in the area. Namely,New and Old 
 Biggs farm,Whitehall Farm.Ellis       
 farm,Langly Common Farm and Highlands.
 The Remount Depot was closed in 1937  
 because horses weren't used so much.  
 In 1937 the army started to build     
 garrison to house two royal artillery 
 regiments. But the war broke out and  
 the regiments never arrived. In 1942  
 REME was formed. (Royal Eletrical and 
 Mechanical Engineers).
