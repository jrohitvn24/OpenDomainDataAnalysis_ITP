		<content>  Most dads don't have much sparetime  
 because they are farmers.Some of them 
 mend cars and scramble on motor bikes.
  When mums have sparetime they like to
 read books,do gardening or play tennis
 and a few mums like painting pictures.
 Some mums make toys and watch         
 television.                           
  Most teenagers have a lot            
 of sparetime they usually go out with 
 their friends to youth club or ride   
 their B.M.X. bikes.Some do pond       
 weeding at the fish farm to earn some 
 money.  Most children live on farms so
 they have to help a lot,some children 
 are lucky, they can play with toys.   
 If children  have a horse they will   
 ride it and groom it.                 
  There are cricket, football,darts and
 snooker teams in Ladock and some of   
 the villagers take part in Grass-track
 racing, moto-cross and trials.{       </content>
