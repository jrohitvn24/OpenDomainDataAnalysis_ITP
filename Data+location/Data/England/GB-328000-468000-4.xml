		<content> Aldingham  is  full  of snails! We saw
 lots   of   snails   in  the   bushes,
 hedgerows  and   rough    patches   of
 brambles. Most  of  them  were  small,
 about  the  size  of  a garden pea. We
 weren't   sure   whether   they   were
 recently  hatched from their eggs or a
 small variety. Tracy got lots of them.
 Laura got a match box  full  of  them.
 When snails move  they  make  a  slimy
 trail behind them. They are a bit like
 slugs but snails have  a  shell  which
 acts like a home. The  shell is shaped
 like a spiral. Snails  live on leaves,
 well all of them were  on  the  leaves
 at Aldingham.  Some were on top of the
 leaves and some were  underneath.  The
 leaves had holes in  them  because the
 snails had eaten them.  They  like  to
 eat   green   or   decaying    leaves.
