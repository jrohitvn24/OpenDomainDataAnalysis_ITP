		<content>     The Quaker Meeting House, built in
 1762 on the west side of the village, 
 is the only site of any supernatural  
 event in Moorsholm. The building was  
 converted into two houses a long      
 time ago.  For many years after the   
 conversion one of the neighbours, an  
 old lady, would knock on the front    
 door of the other to rouse her for    
 Sunday service. The haunting manifests
 itself as knocking on the front door  
 and windows of two houses (in one     
 case at about the time for Sunday     
 Service), opening and closing of doors
 - which will then jam shut.  An       
 apparition has been seen but of       
 indistinct form.  The new owner's dog 
 refused to enter the building at first
 but has now settled in.  The haunting 
 appears to be friendly as no one has  
 suffered ill effects.  There are      
 graves in the gardens of the houses.  </content>
