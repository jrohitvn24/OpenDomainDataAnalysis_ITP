		<content>In 1959,the Spitals Cross Estate was   
open fields and owned by the council.  
Where the entrance to the estate is    
now,there was a Goodwins brick yard.   
The population in Edenbridge was two   
and a half thousand and Spitals Cross  
school was built in the 1960's.        
Marlpit Hill had a small shop,a bakers,
butchers and a regular milkman.the     
postal service was not very good, as   
the postman didn't bother to deliver   
the letters quickly as there were so   
few.                                   
Edenbridge was a very small town,      
largely run by business companies. Not 
many people had televisions and there  
were no youth clubs at all. People     
wanted the entertainment but didn't    
want to organise it! Very few people   
had cars, so they either walked, used  
public transport or cycled. Buses full 
of people ran to Sevenoaks and Oxted.  </content>
