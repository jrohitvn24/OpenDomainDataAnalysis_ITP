		<content>      This block includes the outskirts
 of the built up area of Blackburn. The
 northernmost third is covered by an   
 area of housing. This housing is      
 mainly 20th century development       
 encroaching on farmland, the land     
 cover in the other two thirds of the  
 block.                                
      Farming in the area is the       
 keeping of dairy cows, many farmers   
 bottling and selling their milk       
 directly, rather than through a dairy.
 The rural area contains one village,  
 Tockholes, at one time a farming      
 village, now inhabited by Blackburn   
 commuters.                            
      Parts of the eastern area of the 
 block are given over to recreation,   
 namely Blackburn Rovers Football      
 ground and Darwen Golf Club.
