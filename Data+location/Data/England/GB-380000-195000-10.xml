		<content> Kingscote lacks mains gas.  Many      
 residents regret this.  Space Heating-
 28 out of 32 houses(88%) have central 
 heating.  These are divided evenly    
 between oil fired and solid fuel with 
 a few woodburners.  Central heating is
 often backed up with open log fires.  
 Water Heating is mainly by central    
 heating as above but Rayburn/Aga type 
 cookers heat water in 4 houses.  Most 
 have electric immersion heaters for   
 back up, though 5 houses(15%) are     
 solely dependent on this.  Cooking is 
 dominantly electric(80%) with a few   
 using bottled gas(15%).  Oil or solid 
 fuel cookers make up the rest.        
 Microwaves are rare.  Energy costs are
 one reason why older couples plan to  
 move from larger houses when children 
 have left home.
