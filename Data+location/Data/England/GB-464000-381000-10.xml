		<content>   Ranby Hall is a listed building. It 
 is early Georgian, with a Tuscan porch
 and neo-Tudor windows.                
   In the early nineteenth century it  
 was bought by the Newcastle Estate,   
 and served as the home of the Dowager 
 Duchess of Newcastle. It was sold by  
 the estate about 1912. In 1932, it was
 owned by Charles Francis Darley of the
 brewing family. It was sold by his    
 descendants by auction on 21 Oct.1983.
 The house and grounds (8.57 ac.)sold  
 for Â£110000, the contents for Â£118000.
   The purchaser, a local businessman, 
 planned to turn it into a country     
 restaurant, but on the evening of     
 Sunday 16th September 1984 it was     
 extensively damaged by fire. The fire,
 caused by two Calor gas heaters, was  
 fought by 40 firemen but three        
 quarters of the building was gutted.
