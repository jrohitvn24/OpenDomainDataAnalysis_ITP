		<title>17MY WEEKEND by AMY</title>
		<content> On Saturday I wake up at 7.00 am.I    
 dress in my riding clothes,wash,and   
 then dash downstairs.I eat my         
 breakfast of sugarpuffs.I go down     
 through the garden to the car.My      
 destination is the Glebe Riding       
 Stables where my pony,Winkie,is       
 waiting for me.First I groom him and  
 then I ride.I stay at the Glebe all   
 day doing various  jobs like tack     
 cleaning,sweeping the yard and lastly 
 taking the horses to the field where  
 they will stay all night.My Grandma   
 and Grandad pick me up.I go home to   
 their house as Mum and Dad are at     
 Wimbledon watching the tennis.On      
 Sunday morning Mum and Dad collect me 
 as we are going on a car rally        
 treasure hunt.Afterwards there is a   
 barbeque.When we arrive home I do my  
 homework and watch T.V.before going to
 bed.                                  </content>
