		<title>02NORTH HUISH CHURCH-Education</title>
		<content>{Church of England,}built 14th Century 
 with Spire and three naves; the South 
 one has been converted to accommodate 
 Social activities, but is not yet     
 complete. The bells cannot be used due
 to weakness of main structure.        
{Services}conducted by Rector of       
 Diptford, who also has to cope with   
 the Parishes of Harberton &amp;           
 Harbertonford.  Ugborough has its own 
 Church, but regretfully we have not   
 been able to research this            
 building,which is very old and        
 beautiful. Services at North Huish are
 alternating - one week Holy Communion 
 in the morning and the next Evensong. 
 Nearest Primary School in Diptford and
 Secondary{Schools}in Totnes &amp;         
 Ivybridge. Children transported daily 
 by  MINIBUS through the narrow lanes.
