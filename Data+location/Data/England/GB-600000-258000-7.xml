		<title>07ONEHOUSE VILLAGE</title>
		<content>  Onehouse is a very happy village with
a lot of community spirit.Everybody    
questioned,said that they enjoy living 
in the village.The peace and quiet of  
the country-side is liked by all.The   
village provides many activities,for   
young and old alike.There are plays    
performed by local villagers which are 
watched and enjoyed by all.            
  Onehouse contains a great mixture of 
ages,many people have moved there      
recently and some have lived there for 
over forty years.                      
  On 7th June 1985 a widely used       
village shop was closed and everybody  
was disappointed.A few people had used 
it for things they had forgotten,but   
many used it for their regular         
shopping.There is also a bus service   
through Onehouse to the nearby village 
of Harleston,it turns round and then   
returns to Stowmarket.                 </content>
