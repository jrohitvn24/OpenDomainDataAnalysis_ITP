		<title>07A LOCAL HOUSEWIFE, THORALBY</title>
		<content> We interviewed a local housewife,     
 Jane, who has lived here for 14 years.
 She has a young family, a girl of 8   
 and 2 boys 7 &amp; 5, who all go to the   
 village school at West Burton. Her    
 husband cycles to work three times a  
 week so that she can have the car. He 
 works as a Solicitor in the market    
 town 10 miles away. Jane said she does
 not go out often bacause of lack of   
 transport, but she has two hobbies,   
 Yoga &amp; Acting, which she goes to      
 weekly. They are held in different    
 village halls. She feels that to live 
 happily in this area, it is essential 
 to join in village life. She and her  
 family enjoy gardening and improving  
 their home, built in 1641. The house  
 is one of the earliest stone-built    
 houses in Bishopdale. Mason's marks   
 show that several houses were built by
 the same builder in the 1630's/1640's.</content>
