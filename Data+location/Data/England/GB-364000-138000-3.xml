		<content> MILTON CLEVEDON                       
                                       
 Milton Clevedon did have a population 
 of over 500 but now it has shrunk to  
 81! There used to be a voluntary      
 controlled school which is now a      
 private house. There is a pub in      
 Milton Clevedon. People come to this  
 from quite a way  around. About half a
 mile from the centre of Milton        
 Clevedon is a Maggot Farm producing   
 bait for fishermen.                   
                                       
 WESTCOMBE AND BATCOMBE                
                                       
 Westcombe and nearby Batcombe are     
 small spread out villages.There is    
 only one shop,the Post Office.There   
 are several large farms and a dairy   
 where Cheddar Cheese is made.The      
 church is very similar to Evercreech  
 but without pinnacles on the tower.   </content>
