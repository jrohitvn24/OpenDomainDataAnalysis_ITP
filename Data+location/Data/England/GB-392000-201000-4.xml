		<title>04  CLUBS IN SAPPERTON</title>
		<content>  Years ago before television villagers
 enjoyed entertaining themselves. They 
 acted good plays in the new Village   
 Hall and did Morris Dancing. After    
 television, however, most people      
 stayed in to watch it. Recently many  
 people wanted to start clubs and      
 groups again. In Sapperton a Youth    
 Club meets each Friday.               
  On Sundays a group of 12 children    
 meet in the school. A playgroup for 12
 pre school toddlers is held in the    
 Hall on Mondays and Wednesdays. A     
 church based group called Link Club   
 meets once  a month at Rodmarton for  
 the children of Sapperton and Coates  
 as well. Old people go to the Good    
 Companions at Coates. Some also go to 
 Coates W.I. and to Oakridge Cricket   
 Club.
