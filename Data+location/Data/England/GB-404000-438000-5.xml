		<title>05PARKWOOD SCHOOL - SCIENCE</title>
		<content>    Our local newspaper is the Keighley
 News.  Sometimes our school is        
 mentioned in it as in July 1982 when  
 there was a report and a photograph   
 about our scientific investigations.  
 We collect mini-beasts from the woods,
 wasteland and playgrounds aroung the  
 school.  In 1982 we exhibited our work
 at the Bradford Science Fair. Under   
 stones we found{ants, beetles, snails,
{spiders, woodlice, millipedes, slugs  
{and earwigs. }We kept them in a glass 
 observation tank set up with soil,    
 plants and stones to simulate their   
 environment.  We have also, as a      
 school, been studying a land profile, 
 looking at creatures which live on or 
 below the ground, in streams or ponds 
 around us, and at wild flowers such as
{dandelions, vetch, coltsfoot, willow  
{herb, stitchwort,}which thrive at     
 present in our area.                  </content>
