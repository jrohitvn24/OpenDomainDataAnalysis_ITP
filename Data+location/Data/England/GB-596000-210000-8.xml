		<content>  We go to Tollesbury County Primary   
 School.   It first opened on the 6th  
 of April 1896.   At that time there   
 were two separate schools, one for    
 boys, which is across the main road,  
 called the Masonic Hall, and the girls
 and infants came to the school we are 
 in now.   The Headmistress for the    
 infants was Mrs Henrietta Billing and 
 the Headmistress for the girls was    
 Miss C.M. Thomas.   Today our         
 Headmaster is Mr. Brodie.   The number
 of children is about 280, but this    
 varies when children leave or come.   
 The school has grown rapidly, we have 
 ten classes, and we are having a new  
 school, joined on with four more      
 classrooms.   The sports field is     
 about 2 acres and can fit 3 rounders  
 pitches on it.   We have a high jump, 
 two long jump pitches and a race      
 track.                                </content>
