		<title>12Recording Studio at Ladock 2</title>
		<content> Before Mr.Wood came to Trendeal he    
 lived in{London}where he also ran a   
 recording studio. He came to{Cornwall 
 after his family moved down here and  
 because he prefers the country life   
 although he thinks the city is the    
 best place to find work.              
                                       
 He{records music}mostly at his studio 
 such as{pop, classical or small groups
{of musicians from schools.}He enjoys  
 pop music most of all; he used to play
 in a group when he was a teenager. He 
 doesn't  always record in the studio; 
 he also goes out to record. One day   
 next week he is going out to record a 
 band of eighty musicians at St.       
 Austell.                              
{He does not work regular hours.}Often 
 he works through the night. He works  
 on his own because at the moment he   
 doesn't earn enough to employ anyone. </content>
