		<content> Needwood is on the borders of the     
 areas covered by the{Meynell}and the  
{South Staffordshire Pony Clubs,}both  
 of which are very active with over 100
 members each.                         
                                       
 Both Pony Clubs organise{rallies}for  
 their members who are taught not only 
 the correct way to ride but also how  
 to care for their horses and ponies.  
 A system of{graded tests,}starting    
 with D up to A and including a{Riding 
{and Road Safety Test,}provides a      
 challenge for all.                    
                                       
 Riders come from all over the midlands
 to the{horse trials, hunter trials}and
 other{competitions.} Both Clubs were  
 successful in reaching the finals of  
 some of the national competitions in  
 1985, the Meynell winning the national
 Pony Club Horse Trials Competition.   </content>
