 Spithead, where the "flower" of Henry 
 the Eighth's fleet, the Mary Rose was 
 lost by  disastrous mishap, lies      
 within our 'D' block.                 
      So too does one of Lord          
 Palmerston's infamous Spithead Forts. 
 Spitsand or Spitbank Fort is now      
 privately owned,having been bought    
 from the Ministry of Defence several  
 years ago.                            
      Siskin School as part of the     
 Domesday Project caught a ferry from  
 Gosport Ferry,via Clarence Pier to    
 'take a jolly to Palmerston's         
 Folly'.This massive Victorian island  
 is built in the sea about one  mile   
 (or 10 minutes by ferry) from         
 Portsmouth.
