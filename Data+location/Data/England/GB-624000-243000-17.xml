		<content>At the end of six months, successful   
trainees with their wives and families 
were sent to their respective holdings.
Those with a flair for open            
horticulture,pigs and poultry were sent
to larger holdings 8 to 10 acres.Others
were allocated to 5 acre medium        
holdings with part glass. The smallest 
holdings of 3 acres, many on the best  
land, were reserved for those who      
wished to specialise in glass, mainly  
growing tomatoes and lettuces.         
In the first few years there were      
frequent failures and disappointments  
and many of the original trainees left.
At the outbreak of war in 1939 all     
grants towards settling unemployed men 
on the land ceased, instead the L.S.A. 
accepted tenants with agricultural     
experience and a limited amount of     
capital.
