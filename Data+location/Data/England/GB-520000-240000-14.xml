		<title>14LIFE STYLES IN HINXWORTH</title>
		<content>                                       
 The population of Hinxworth and       
 Edworth has changed from mostly       
 farmers and labourers to mostly       
 professional people who can afford all
 the modern conveniences e.g. no house 
 is now without a washing machine, all 
 have televisions, most have cars and  
 many have microwave ovens, videos     
 Hi-Fis and some even have their own   
 home computers. Many can afford to go 
 abroad for holidays most going at     
 least as far as the continent and many
 much further. Eating out is popular   
 and our local pub does very good bar  
 meals.Local events of all sorts are   
 well patronised as most people have   
 consciously decided to live in a      
 village and therefore feel that       
 joining in the life of the village is 
 important.
