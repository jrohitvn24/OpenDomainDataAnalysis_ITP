		<content> In 1985 Dorset Police in conjunction  
 with Abbey Life Insurance Company     
 started a scheme to promote good      
 relations between children and        
 policemen.They called this the 'Cop a 
 card'scheme.Nancy,a 6 year            
 old,writes about it.'The policemen in 
 Christchurch carry lots of copcards in
 their pockets.There are 36 different  
 copcards.Some have Queen Elizabeth on 
 and some have got policewomen on a    
 horses back and some have got river   
 patrol and some have got a peacock on 
 them.I met a policeman in             
 Christchurch.I asked him for a copcard
 and he gave me a copcard.I have got   
 lots of copcards.I have got 10        
 copcards now.When I see a policeman   
 anywhere I ask for a copcard.'
