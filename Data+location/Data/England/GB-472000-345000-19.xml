		<title>19Home Life Flintham/Syerston.</title>
		<content> Those working on the farms tend to eat
 their{main meal}at mid-day as do the  
 retired who have lived in the villages
 all their lives. Meals on Wheels are  
 delivered to some of the retired in   
 Flintham.                             
                                       
 There is a noticeable trend in both   
 villages, especially among the younger
 people towards{healthier eating;}more}
 fruit and vegetables and wholefoods   
 generally. A minor miracle occurred   
 when a 'naughty' boy was transformed  
 with the removal of additives from his
 diet.                                 
                                       
 As in all villages there is a lot of  
 gossiping but none of it is malicious,
 more friendly interest in one another.
 Both villages are caring villages and 
 if anyone needs help of any kind there
 will always be someone to lend a hand.</content>
