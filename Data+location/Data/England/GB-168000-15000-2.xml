		<title>02Predannack Airfield</title>
		<content> Predannack airfield is owned by RNAS  
 Culdrose and is used as a helicopter  
 base to train pilots.It was built and 
 used during the Second World War.It   
 was here in 1950 that Dr.Barnes       
 Wallace,who invented the bouncing     
 bomb,experimented with swept wing     
 aircraft.                             
 The original headquarters of RAF      
 Predannack,built in 1940,is now       
 private property and is called Mill   
 View.After the war it was used as a   
 Cheshire home and the present bungalow
 was built at this time.Later a farmer 
 bought it to rear young animals, using
 the bungalow as his home.After that it
 was sold again and turned into a      
 holiday home for the mentally and     
 physically handicapped and it is      
 still being used as this.
