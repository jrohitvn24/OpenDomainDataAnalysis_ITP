<title>21THE WATER SLIDE, RICHMOND.</title>
<content>The Wild Waters in Old Deer Park, Richmond, was essentially a product of the "Golden Age of Flumes" of the late 1980's and was built at a time when the race was on to see who could have the largest and grandest set of flumes. Although long gone, it has an important place in waterslide history, as in its day it was the largest, and only, 4-flume set in the UK. Designed built and operated by Waterslides PLC (an Australian company that still exists under the name Waterslides PTY) and opened in Old Deer Park in 1985, it was an immediate sucess as no waterslide complex of this size had ever been seen in the UK before. &lt;br />&lt;br />Waterslides PLC eventually went into administration in August 1989 and Wild Waters closed on 28th October 1989.   &lt;br />
