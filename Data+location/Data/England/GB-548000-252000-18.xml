		<title>18 GOG MAGOG GOLF COURSE 1</title>
		<content> There is a 9 hole practice course and 
 an 18 hole course for advanced        
 golfers. The ground staff comprises a 
 head green-keeper, 35 yrs service, his
 deputy in charge of machinery who both
 live on the course and enjoy playing  
 golf; plus 4 others. They work an 8 hr
 day plus overtime when preparing for  
 matches.They are responsible for the  
 270 acre area including 36 acres of   
 fairway.The 5 acres of green are cut  
 once each day except Sunday with 3    
 large tractor mowers which cut very   
 finely at 400 cuts per yd. It takes 4 
 hours to mow 27 greens.A mechanical   
 rake is used to break up and rake the 
 sand in the bunkers. This does the    
 work which once took 6 men 1 day. The 
 completely automatic watering system  
 is controlled by 1 master switch. Each
 green has 5 pop_up sprinklers.
