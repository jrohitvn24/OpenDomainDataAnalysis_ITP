		<content> I am tall (1.42 m.) and thin and have 
 long legs, and can run quite fast. I  
 have long brown hair, brown eyes and a
 brown skin and weigh 35kg. I am 8     
 years old and my birthday is on       
 Christmas Day. Sometimes I am very    
 shy. Quite often when we go swimming I
 feel a bit nervous. During playtime   
 at school I like to play horses with  
 my friends or skipping. I like wearing
 nice clothes and having my hair done. 
 At school I like doing my tables and  
 spelling. When we go home I often have
 nothing to do, so I get out my        
 spelling and tables straight away and 
 then I don't have to do them later on.
