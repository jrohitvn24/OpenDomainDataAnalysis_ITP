		<content>Little Billing has been a parish with  
its own church from at least Saxon     
times. In the Middle Ages the          
De-Longeville family were Lords of the 
Manor and remains of the 14th century  
Hall can still be seen. Later the      
estate passed to the Thursbys of       
Abington, a mile or two away, where    
Shakespeare's last descendant,         
Elizabeth Barnard had died in 1669.    
A fight between the Cavaliers and      
Roundheads took place during the Civil 
War on Billing Brdge - where the       
present mill stands.The Royalists were 
defeated. Opposite the Aquadrome       
is a circular earthwork which was      
probably used as a beacon hill for     
sending smoke signals to the Iron Age  
camp at Hunsbury Hill. There is a      
Viking tunnel under the road from the  
Priory to Little Billing church. In the
1940s German prisoners worked here.    </content>
