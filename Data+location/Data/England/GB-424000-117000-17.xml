		<title>17HISTORY OF NOMANSLAND CONT.</title>
		<content> The village but there was a dame      
 school.A dame school is a cottage with
 just one lady teaching.In 1870 the    
 Nomansland School was built ,in that  
 time they had to sit on benches and   
 write with chalk on a slate.They also 
 had very bad punishments.             
                                       
                EXECUTIONS             
                                       
 People from far and near came to see  
 these executions.These were ghastly   
 sites but some people loved watching  
 them.A very old man trudged to        
 Salisbury to see them.A doctor passing
 through the neighbourhood was killed  
 when crossing Wellow Common by a      
 hatchet.It was hidden in a gypsies    
 tent where it was found by a gipsy and
 he was said to have put it there and  
 was executed.
