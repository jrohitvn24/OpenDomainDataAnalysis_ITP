 Jaws                                  
 Jaws is a game that you play on the   
 log.  The log is a ship and there are 
 about six girls on board the ship and 
 six boys as sharks.  The sharks have  
 to try to get the girls and take them 
 to their den.                         
                                       
 Hacky 123                             
 In Hacky 123 one person is on and they
 have to count to a certain number.    
 While this is going on the others     
 hide.  When the person has finished   
 counting you have to sneak up to the  
 post without being tug.  If you make  
 it you have to say "" Hacky 123       
 Home.""
