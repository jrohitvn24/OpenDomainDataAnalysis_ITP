    One of the changes in Sidcup has   
 been the final decision that the two  
 schools, Parklands School for boys and
 Sidcup School for girls are joining up
 to make one mixed school, called {    
{Cleve Park}.                          
    It has been decided that there is  
 going to be a Headmistress.The mix is 
 going to be a gradual one.The new     
 school will be on the{Parklands School
{site,}the girls moving there.On the   
 Sidcup Girls School site the huts will
 be demolished and Birkbeck Primary    
 School will have the whole of the main
 building to themselves.The mobile     
 classrooms at the rear of the primary 
 school may be demolished to make way  
 for a{new housing estate ?}
