		<title>02Hambleden Estate.</title>
		<content>The estate has four ridges running     
north and south with three valleys     
between them.The RiverThames is        
situated at the base of these.At the   
top of the ridges there is a clay cap  
with beech trees.The valleys are       
sheltered providing warm meadows for   
the cows who make good use of the      
pasture.Halfway up the hills,the chalk 
breaks out and it is here that any     
trees growing will surely die.         
 As the present Lord Hambleden's father
died very young,the death duties were  
heavy and trust funds were set up.The  
estate of 3000 acres is leased to three
farmers.Some of the fields are leased  
on a yearly basis so that it can be    
reclaimed at the end of a season.Sheep 
do very well in this situation.The     
cereal hay-day is over as efficiency   
has increased.
