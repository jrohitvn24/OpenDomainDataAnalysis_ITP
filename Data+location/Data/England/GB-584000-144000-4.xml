		<content>{ Horticulture}can be an expensive and 
 risky business,even when sheltered by 
 heat controlled greenhouses.Early{1985
 was a bleak winter -  snow and frost  
 ruined many plants in local nurseries 
 and market gardens causing consider-  
 able loss.Beans,Lettuce,Tomatoes and  
 other salad commodities are grown for 
 marketing.In Summer months,soft fruits
 like{Strawberries}and{Raspberries}are 
 also sent to market;one farm operates 
 a"Pick-you-own"facility,selling direct
 to the public.{Vegetables,Flowers}and 
{Fruit}can often be bought at the road-
 side from places that have surplus    
 crops,but the larger orchards have    
 disappeared from this particular area.
 One nursery has about 7 acres covered 
 by huge glasshouses growing flowers   
 for London markets.The{Chrysanthemums}
 are carefully packed in cardboard     
 boxes and despatched by British Rail. </content>
