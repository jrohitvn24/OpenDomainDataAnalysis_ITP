		<title>14A CARAVAN IN FLAKEBRIDGE</title>
		<content> We have lived in a caravan for the    
 past 4 years.It has been rewarding in 
 many ways.My husband's work in        
 forestry has taken us to lots of      
 beautiful places,mostly in the north  
 of England.For the past 18 months we  
 have been at Flakebridge.This is a    
 large mixed woodland teeming with     
 wildlife.Living in a caravan &amp;        
 travelling broadens one's outlook on  
 life.It makes one appreciate small    
 luxuries such as water &amp; electricity  
 neither of which we have.We meet      
 people from different walks of        
 life,from the roadside gypsy to       
 landowners,finding good &amp; bad in all  
 societies.It has been an experience   
 well worth having even though it is a 
 hard life.I enjoy each season as it   
 comes &amp; goes,seeing nature at its     
 best.
