		<title>15COINAGEHALL STREET (1)</title>
		<content>{Coinagehall Street}is the main street 
 of the town of Helston. From Medieval 
 times until the nineteenth century    
 Helston was the centre of an important
 tin mining region. The coinage hall   
 was were the quality of the tin from  
 the area was checked and assessed.    
       This building originally served 
 as {the Chapel of Our Lady}and dated  
 back to early medieval times. During  
 the Reformation, in about 1574, it was
 dissolved by Edward the Second and    
 converted into a coinage hall by the  
 townspeople of Helston.               
       At the end of the eighteenth    
 century the position of the           
 coinage hall in the middle of         
 Helston's main thoroughfare was found 
 to be inconvenient. The two members of
 parliament for Helston in 1796 wanted 
 to remove and rebuild it in a more    
 convenient part of the town.          </content>
