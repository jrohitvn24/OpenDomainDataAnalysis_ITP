		<title>05BLISS CHARITY AIDED SCHOOL</title>
		<content>In 1674 William Bliss, a wine merchant 
living in Southwark, died. William had 
been brought up in Heyford and later   
moved to London. In his will he left   
400 pounds to the village: 100 to buy  
a schoolhouse and 300 to buy some land,
whose rent would pay for the upkeep of 
the school and the schoolmaster. This  
money was to be administered by        
Trustees from the village. All children
from Nether &amp; Upper Heyford were       
allowed to attend free of charge, also 
any child with the name of Bliss living
within a 5 mile radius. The first      
school opened in 1683. The school, as  
we know it now, opened in 1880. The    
outside hasn't changed much, but inside
it has changed. There are still 9      
Trustees who administer the Charity and
the income from investments pays for   
any new buildings and also for the     
outside maintenance of the school.     </content>
