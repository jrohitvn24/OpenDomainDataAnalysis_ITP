		<content> A DAY IN THE LIFE OF BENJAMIN BRYANT. 
                                       
 I am nine years old and I live in Far 
 Oakridge.                             
 On Saturdays I normally get up and    
 look at magazines before I have my    
 breakfast and then I get dressed and  
 go shopping in Stroud. When we get    
 home we have lunch and then go to a   
 pheasant farm in North Cerney. At the 
 farm we go fishing and sometimes      
 shooting and my two brothers 'bit' the
 baby pheasant chicks that are about   
 four weeks old. Sometimes there is a  
 power cut and some of them will die so
 we have to warm them up. When we get  
 home from the farm I ride my bike and 
 then read the paper and help Mum with 
 the ironing and then we have our      
 dinner.When we are in bed we muck     
 around until my Dad will tell us to   
 get into bed.                         </content>
