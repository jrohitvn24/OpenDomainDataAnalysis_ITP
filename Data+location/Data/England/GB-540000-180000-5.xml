		<title>05THE NORTHERN OUTFALL SEWER</title>
		<content> The Northern Outfall Sewer runs       
 through Newham. It takes the dirty    
 water from London to Beckton. It is   
 cleaned and then flows into the River 
 Thames. In the old days there was no  
 sewer. People used to get a disease   
 from the dirty water.                 
 There are no houses on the bank       
 because under a house you need a      
 foundation to support it and under the
 bank there is only dirty water.       
 The sewer bank is long and narow and  
 has a footpath along it. There are    
 lots of different kinds of grasses and
 wild flowers. Two of the grasses are  
 meadow foxtail and false oat grass. We
 found  a birds nest and lots of       
 insects. There are big muddy puddles  
 and some rubbish.
