		<title>05Pubs in Malmesbury</title>
		<content>    In the nineteenth century,         
 Malmesbury had thirty two pubs, but   
 today only nine survive. One of the   
 pubs which has disappeared was called 
{'The Brewery Tap'}in the Cross Hayes; 
 it is now a video shop. Another was   
{'The White Lion'}near the Market      
 Cross, now a private house. Once a    
 maid there was{savaged by a tiger}from
 a travelling circus. Another popular  
 pub was{'The Flying Monk',}knocked    
 down to make way for a{supermarket.   
    Many of the present pubs are of    
 historic interest.{'The Rose and      
{Crown'}used to be part of Malmesbury's
 medieval wall.{"The King's Arms",     
 Malmesbury's{oldest pub,}used to be a 
 coaching inn.{"The Old Bell"}used to  
 be a part of Malmesbury Abbey.        
    We carried out a survey using the  
 pubs. The thing they enjoyed most was 
 the friendly atmosphere in pubs.      </content>
