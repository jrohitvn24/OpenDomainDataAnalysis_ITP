		<title>12CHARLTON VILLAGE FETE</title>
		<content>    On Saturday 13th July 1985,        
 Charlton Village Fete was held on the 
 Playing Field.Some members of the     
 class entered an obstacle course race 
 which was good fun. They won and were 
 presented with a trophy and a cheque  
 for Â£20. Little children could have a 
 ride on a miniature steam train. On   
 sale were crafts, home-made cakes, and
 ice-creams. There were other side     
 shows and donated items for sale. This
 is an annual event and proceeds are   
 used to help maintain the Village     
 Hall.                                 
    The Fete is very popular and       
 everyone has a lot of fun, even those 
 who work hard to organise the event.
