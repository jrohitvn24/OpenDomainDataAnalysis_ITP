		<title>13Then &amp; Now- life in 1925 (1)</title>
		<content>{Mrs Hobbs,aged 78, was interviewed    
{by children from South Brent Primary  
{School, using a tape recorder. Their  
{questions and her replies were:       
{                                      
{What sort of clothes did you wear in  
{1925?                                 
 It wasn't anything very different to  
 what we wear now. The skirt came just 
 below the knee not above the knee.    
 Hats- hats were straw hats, mostly    
 brown and we always mostly had ribbons
 on them to decorate them. Not really  
 old-fashioned.                        
 Shoes were very similar to what we    
 wear today; of course going back      
 another ten years it would be nailed  
 boots and button-up shoes- quite old- 
 fashioned.                            
{What did old people wear in 1925?     
 They wore skirts down to their ankles 
 and lace-up shoes or boots- very often</content>
