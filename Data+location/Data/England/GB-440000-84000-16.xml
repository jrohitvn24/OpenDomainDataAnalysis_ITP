		<title>16Housing in Calbourne.</title>
		<content> As Calbourne is an old fashioned rural
 village most of the houses are pretty 
{cottage-type}constructions, many      
 retaining their thatched roofs. The   
 farm houses and workers cottages      
 outside the village are generally     
 detached. However in the village about
 a third are detached, a third semi-   
 detached and the remainder terraced.  
 Generally they are constructed either 
 of{brick}or{stone}with{tiled}or{slate}
 roofs. Houses date from 400 years old 
 to the most recent building which was 
 constructed about five years ago. Many
 homes have central heating but most   
 still make use of an open fire.
