		<title>13My Day</title>
		<content> I get up very slowly at 7.30 a.m. I   
 walk half asleep into the bathroom for
 a wash.Then I go downstairs for a cup 
 of tea-very refreshing! Then I  get   
 dressed and get everything ready for  
 school. I'm off at 8.45. When I get to
 school I walk to the back playground  
 for an exciting game of football.When 
 the bell rings we all flock in and    
 start reading. Then we have assembly; 
 today was singing practice.Maths next,
 we're doing practical work. At dinner 
 time I go to Jonathan's,today we had  
 sandwiches.We go back to school at    
 1.15 p.m. and do "Going Places",I work
 with my partner Jonathan.After school 
 I play cricket in the playground and  
 then go home and have my tea.Bed time 
 comes at 10.30.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
