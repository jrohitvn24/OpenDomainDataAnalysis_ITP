		<title>10FIELD STUDIES - HORTON KIRBY</title>
		<content>    The Kent Education Committee Field 
 Centre in School Lane is used by      
 schools in N. W. Kent. It takes       
 children from 5 to 18 years old. The  
 main building has 3 rooms. The        
 adjoining school house can accommodate
 a small group. A full-time warden     
 gives help and advice to teachers if  
 required.                             
    Any school can book a visit. Many  
 classes use the Centre as a base for a
 day's field work. Outside study can be
 followed up in the Centre, which is   
 well stocked with field equipment,    
 laboratory apparatus, books and local 
 information.                          
    The adjoining field is planted with
 bushes to attract birds and insects.  
 It has a pond, a bird hide and bee    
 hives. There is an indoor observation 
 hive. In the winter adult classes     
 are held at the Centre.               </content>
