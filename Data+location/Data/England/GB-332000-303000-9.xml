 The Worthen village hall was built in 
 1977 at a cost of Â£34,773.It replaced 
 the British Legion Hall which was     
 built just after World War I.The      
 Legion Hall was a large wooden hut,but
 the present hall is built of brick    
 under a tile roof.The hall has one    
 large room, entrance hall,kitchen/bar,
 committee room,two store rooms,toilets
 and a shower.An extension was built in
 1982 as a doctor's surgery and waiting
 room.This extension was awarded a     
 Village Venture Award in 1983.Next to 
 the Worthen Village Hall is the Powell
 -Dicken Field given as an amenity to  
 the community in 1927,it is mainly    
 used as a football pitch and as a     
 children's playing field.
