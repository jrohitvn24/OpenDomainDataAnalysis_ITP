		<title>09DAIRY FARMING</title>
		<content>  Dairy farming is the most popular    
 type of farming around here. Many     
 farms are quite big with around 150   
 cows, but there are some small        
 holdings with just a few cows.        
  Each cow is recorded and numbered,   
 facts about each are written down,    
 such as when it last had a calf,      
 whether another was due, its age etc..
  Each cow is milked twice a day, once 
 in the morning about 6:30am and once  
 in the afternoon about 3:30pm. The    
 amount of milk depends on the type of 
 cow. Most local farms have Fresian    
 cows which produce more good quality  
 milk than most. In an average sized   
 farm they can produce up to, or more  
 than, 2700 litres, but can drop down  
 to 300 litres a day. The milk is sold 
 to the Milk Marketing Board in or     
 around Wrexham mainly. Every morning a
 milk tanker collects the milk.        </content>
