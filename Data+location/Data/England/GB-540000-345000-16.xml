 Leverton Show and Gymkhana.This event 
 is held annually towards the end of   
 July and has grown over the years into
 its present form.The Show is held to  
 raise money for the Village Hall(not  
 contained within the block)to defray  
 running expenses.There are            
 competitions for village people in    
 many different classes ranging from   
 cookery to vegetable classes,home-made
 wine and handicrafts.Local traders    
 and craftsmen are also represented and
 this year there were demonstrations by
 a military preservation group and a   
 Taekwando group.The gymkhana has the  
 usual horse events but is restricted  
 to local competitors.A superstars     
 event is also hotly contested between 
 local teams of athletes.Many cups and 
 trophies are awarded to winners       
 generously donated by local firms.    </content>
