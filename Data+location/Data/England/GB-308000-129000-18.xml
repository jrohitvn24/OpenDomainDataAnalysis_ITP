 There are some beautiful walks in our 
 block                                 
                                       
 Walk 1:                               
 Park near Oakhampton Farm on the      
 B3188. Find the path which runs       
 through the farm ( this is difficult  
 as there are no signposts ). Then walk
 along the broad, level track away from
 the farm to the west. Soon the ground 
 becomes steeper and it gets more      
 tiring.                               
 Soon you come to the quarry. Take a   
 look around the quarry, but make sure 
 you don't fall over the edge. It is   
 very steep and visitors are advised   
 not to clamber down into the quarry.
