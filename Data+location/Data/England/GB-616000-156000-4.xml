		<content> About 10% of the area surveyed        
 consisted of open woodland.  Much of  
 it (about 75%) showed signs of        
 coppicing.  Between every 8-25 years  
 the growth is cut and then allowed to 
 shoot again from the stumps.  The most
 common species observed were Sweet    
 Chestnut, Hornbeam and                
 Hazel(especially in Trenley Park      
 Wood).  Sweet Chestnut is used for    
 fencing but the market for coppice    
 timber is less important now.         
 Larger trees known as standards are   
 grown in between the coppiced trees.  
 This is designed to give well spaced  
 oaks room to develop and spread.  Some
 farmers now cut chestnut fencing for  
 themselves and sell the surplus as hop
 poles and fruit stakes. Some woodland 
 areas seemed to be neglected with     
 several unculled dead and fallen trees
