		<content> Caldbeck Fells, once extensively      
 mined, are still of interest to       
 geologists, who come on study trips to
 the area. High Greenrigg House is open
 all year round for such groups and    
 also functions as a restaurant for    
 non-residents. Another restaurant at  
 Parkend and several bed and breakfast 
 facilities and self-catering holiday  
 cottages also cater for the visitor.  
                                       
 ARTS AND CRAFTS: Greenrigg Pottery    
 produces stoneware pottery, which is  
 sold from the workshop and at local   
 shows and craft fairs; also hand-woven
 rugs are made here using undyed wool  
 from Herdwick, Swaledale and Jacob    
 fleeces. A small group meets at Whelpo
 to continue the traditional craft of  
 making rag rugs by hooking or prodding
 long or short strips through hessian.
