		<title>02        THE KNOLL (CONT.)</title>
		<content> If you looked hard enough you could   
 see the traffic on the{A49}on the     
 other side of our Domesday area. We   
 could see many buildings, mainly farm 
 buildings, some of them were{derelict.
 If you looked carefully you could see 
 the railway line and the bridges that 
 it goes under. The line goes from     
 Hereford to{Shrewsbury.}On the top of 
 the Knoll you could smell silage,     
 sheep and fresh air. It was cold and  
 windy, some of us were nearly blown   
 off the top but it was a great feeling
 because you could see for miles. We   
 could hear the traffic but the cars   
 looked very small. On the way down it 
 started to rain so we ran someone fell
 down but he was alright, it was great 
 running down from the top to the gate 
 at the bottom.
