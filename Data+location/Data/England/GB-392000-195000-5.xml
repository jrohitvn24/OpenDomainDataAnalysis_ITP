		<title>05THE FORGE</title>
		<content> Rodmarton forge has been on the edge  
 of the village for 4 years. Its 2     
 workshops are carpentry &amp; metalwork.  
 The latter has 3 forges.These contain 
 a lot of coal lit by a blow torch     
 fuelled by bottle gas. A fan is used  
 to make the fire burn well.Steel is   
 put in the fire and when pliable it is
 beaten into shape on an anvil.The     
 blacksmith is a farrier but no longer 
 shoes horses. His main work is mending
 farm machinery. In the carpentry shop 
 gates,hurdles,stable doors and posts  
 are made. Special orders such as      
 rabbit hutches and dog kennels are    
 fulfilled. Most of the wood used is   
 imported soft wood treated with       
 preservative.Wire,twine,saws, hammers 
 and other items used on farms are     
 sold.The owner sells feeding troughs  
 with adjusable legs which he designed.
 8 people work at the forge.           </content>
