		<title>03Alex Pickering's Typical Day</title>
		<content> I woke up at about 7.30 and           
 went downstairs to get my breakfast.  
 I had Weetabix and a piece of toast.  
 Then I went upstairs to get washed and
 ready for school.  I say goodbye to my
 mum and then I set off for school at  
 8.30 and arrive about 8.45.  School   
 starts at 8.55.  Our first lesson was 
 maths.  I enjoy maths quite a lot.    
 Then at 10.30 we had our first break. 
 I played cricket with the boys. Then  
 we listened to Juliet's talk on       
 hamsters which she brought to the     
 class. After lunch we took our PE kit 
 into the classroom to go to           
 games.  Our last break was from 2.15  
 to 2.30.  Then we did some work in our
 notebooks.  At 3.25 we went home.  I  
 took my dog for a walk and then had my
 tea. I watched some TV until 10.33 and
 then I went to bed.
