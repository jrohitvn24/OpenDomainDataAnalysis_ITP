		<title>03SUNDAY FAMILY LIFE</title>
		<content> Our group are doing a day in the life 
 of{a normal Sunday for a family.}We   
 will base it on family life. We think 
 that the family should have some      
 children who go to school and a father
 who works. The family will have to    
 live in the 12 square kilometres that 
 the school is covering. We think that 
 they will probably have a{roast meal  
{for dinner.}We interviewed the        
 family's mother and she said that she 
 gets up at half past eight in the     
 morning and has toast for breakfast.  
 They don't go to church. They have a  
 roast meal for lunch. In the afternoon
 the family does{gardening}or goes out.
 They watch mainly{nature programmes}on
{television}in the evening. They have  
 their evening meal at about six       
 o'clock.They go to bed at ten o'clock.
 "This is just a normal Sunday", she   
 said.                                 </content>
