		<title>08Types of houses and farms</title>
		<content> Lots of houses in our survey area are 
 made of stone and are very old.Some of
 the cottages have thatched roofs.There
 are no new estates.Most of the        
 new houses are detached bungalows     
 because old people often retire and   
 come to live in Cornwall.Some houses  
 are let in the summer to people on    
 holiday.There are several farmhouses  
 in the area because much of the land  
 is farmland.                          
 Most of the farms are mainly          
 dairy.There is a little farm that     
 has pigs and poultry and another that 
 does a bit of horticulture.A few farms
 have mixed crops.There is no Grade 1  
 land and a tiny bit of Grade 2 and 3  
 and a lot of Grade 4 and 5 which is   
 poorer grassland and rough grazing and
 some ungraded land.The farmer on      
 Predannack is trying to clear stones  
 from some of the rough land.          </content>
