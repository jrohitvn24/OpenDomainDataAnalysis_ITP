		<title>02LA ROCQUE HARBOUR</title>
		<content>      You will generally see around 30 
 boats in La Rocque Harbour, varying in
 size and colour with names like Mimi, 
 Daddy, Busy Bee, Nancy and Lizette.   
 The harbour is of local granite and   
 there are metal rings to tie your boat
 to.  Many of the fishermen are around 
 retirement age.  There are not only   
 less fishermen these days, but less   
 fish than before.  They fish for      
 shrimps, lobster and low water fish   
 which they sell to the market and     
 their neighbours as well as keeping   
 some for themselves.  The fishermen   
 have to be very skilled as there are  
 lots of sharp rocks and many strong   
 currents around La Rocque.  My grandad
 has a certificate for rescuing three  
 people who were marooned on a rock.   
 The speed of the tide is very fast and
 you can easily be trapped.
