		<title>09THE CHURCH IN THE COMMUNITY</title>
		<content>Within our area 10 to 12% of the pop.  
go church, more than twice the number  
in towns. 15 years ago the church in   
Collier St. nearly closed through lack 
of support. Growth has been steady     
since then. The curate (also of Yalding
&amp; Laddingford) is a "non stipendury    
minister". He maintains his job as     
Communications Manager in an oil comp. 
 Within the community Colin conducts   
services, baptisms &amp; weddings but not  
funerals as he is in London when people
want to be buried midweek! He visits   
people, leads home groups and attends  
various meetings e.g.worship committee 
and the P.C.C. He does 2 jobs really   
but, as he says, he has one function:  
he is a priest in all he does. The     
church gives people a "vision outside  
themselves". There is a regular Sunday 
Eucharist and services at other times  
like healing services.                 </content>
