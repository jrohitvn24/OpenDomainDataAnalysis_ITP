<title>26Homes in 2011</title>
<content>Housing in 2011! &lt;br />&lt;br />In 2011 there are a wide range of houses such as :bungalows ,semi-detach, flats and just normal ones with an upstairs and a downstairs as well as not being attached to another house. &lt;br />&lt;br />A recent building is the Cherry Trees Nursing Home for the elderly. It is just beside our school and they get regular visits from our school choir to perform to them. The changes I have  noticed is that: the building has got far bigger and is built it new bricks and modern planks of wood, there is a big garden with trees benches and flowers.(A big change from the old Cherry Trees)!&lt;br />&lt;br />In our homes in 2011 there is now things like a Skye box for your TV, a house phone and a toilet inside. There are lots of new build houses compared to 25 years ago especially near Arnold area. &lt;br />&lt;br />Since 25 years ago houses have changed a lot. I wonder what it will be like in another 25 years? &lt;br />&lt;br />
