		<title>16Tourism in our area</title>
		<content> We get many tourists in the area.Some 
 stay at a caravan site in our block.  
 Most of them are walkers,climbers,    
 fishermen or outdoor pursuit enthus-  
 iasts.                                
    Many steam enthusiasts come to Long
 Marton to take photographs of steam   
 trains still running on the Carlisle  
 to settle line.                       
    There are two Roman sites in the   
 block, a camp and a fortlet.The old   
 Roman road passes through and is still
 used as a footpath to Appleby.        
    There is an old tithe barn near the
 church,the church itself has many in- 
 teresting features and attracts many  
 vsitors.                              
    Many people follow the river look- 
 ing for wild life,flora and fauna and 
 to see the weirs and bridges.         
    Many visitors stay locally to be   
 close to the Lake District.           </content>
