		<content>     In{winter}there is quite a lot to 
 do.All the animals are in the shed    
 and we have to feed them morning and  
 night.We feed them hay and cake.When  
 it starts to snow there is even more  
 work to do because we have to dig     
 ourselves out.                        
     In{spring}there's also a lot to do
 because it's lambing time.We stay up  
 nearly all night.After lambing is over
 we normally have tame lambs to feed.  
 They are pests most of the time       
 because they are always trying to get 
 in the garden.                        
     In {summer}there is hay and silage
 to make.It is very hot and tiring.    
 First  we have to cut the hay then we 
 turn it till it's dry. Finally we bale
 it.                                   
   At the end of{Autumn}the cows are   
 brought into the shed ready for winter
 and the ewes mate with the rams.      </content>
