		<content> In the past the railway and the canal 
 played an important part in the life  
 of the town. Nowadays{transport}is    
 concentrated on the road network, the 
 rail links and the canal being        
 primarily  for leisure use rather than
{industry}.An indication of the decline
 of the use of the railway is shown by 
 the number of trains which, though    
 travelling through Congleton, no      
 longer stop there. The function of the
 railway has been transformed from that
 of industrial link to passenger       
 service for Congleton people who wish 
 to work or shop in larger towns such  
 as Stoke on Trent or Manchester.
