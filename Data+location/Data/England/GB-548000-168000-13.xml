		<title>13Housing in Swanley</title>
		<content>  The town of Swanley is quite new.    
Nearly all of the 6,915 households     
occupy houses,bungalows,flats or       
Maisonettes which were built in the    
20th centuary.The station-master's     
house,built in 1862,is the oldest      
building in the town.Some of the houses
,built on either side of the High      
street in about 1900,are still without 
proper bathrooms.                      
  Apart from the two housing estates at
Hart-Dyke road and Lullingstone Avenue,
which were built in the 1920's by      
Dartford rural council.No new roads    
were built in Swanley untill after the 
war.A small number of houses built by  
local builders in the 1930's are to be 
found on the two main roads,London to  
Dover,Dartford-Sevenoaks.              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
