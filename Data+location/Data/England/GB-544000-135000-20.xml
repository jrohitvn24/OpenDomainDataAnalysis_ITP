		<content>  Hartfield has a good age mixture. The
 large council estate mixes with the   
 older period houses. Many people have 
 moved into the village from London and
 near by towns.Houses are very         
 expensive by south east standards. The
 school has risen in numbers from 70 in
 1981 to an estimated 140 by 1987.Being
 a conservation area house building is 
 rather limited.
