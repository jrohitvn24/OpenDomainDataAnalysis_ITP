		<content> In the school there are 7 teachers.  3
 full time, 3 part time and 1 French.  
 The school cater for children from    
 four and a half to eleven years old.  
 The school is very small because there
 are only 50 pupils.  There are only   
 three classes.  They have a{piano}and 
 the{electrical equipment}are          
 two record players, a T.V. printing   
 machine, tape recorder, cooker,       
 fridge, kettle, heaters and a slide   
 projector.  They used to have a       
 computer but it was stolen.  During   
 the strike the teachers kept on       
 working.  They have a staffroom.  They
 have a{school uniform}but they do not 
 have to wear it. The colours are      
 navy blue, white and grey.  They have 
 two spare rooms, library remedial and 
 French.  These are now all terrapins.
