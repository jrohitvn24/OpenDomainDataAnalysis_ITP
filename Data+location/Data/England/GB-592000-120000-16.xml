		<title>16The Elderly in Rye</title>
		<content>  We asked one of the organisers about 
 activities for the old people. She    
 told us about the day centre where the
 old people have tea, coffee and talk  
 to each other. They do knitting,      
 sewing and at 12 oclock they have a   
 cooked lunch. The old people come not 
 only from Rye but from surrounding    
 villages. The oldest person there is  
 85, the youngest 64. It takes place in
 6 rooms of the Baptist Hall every     
 Wednesday and usually 26 people go.   
  The money for running it is raised by
 other organisations in the town. The  
 old people pay one pound each time    
 they come.                            
  The W.R.V.S. runs a "Meals on Wheels"
 service and there is also a monthly   
 lunch club. There are two sites of old
 people's flats in Rye.
