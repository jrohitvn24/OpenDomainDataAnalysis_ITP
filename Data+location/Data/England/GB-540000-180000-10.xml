		<content> Anyone who lives in Beckton lives near
 the park. We all have bikes and spend 
 a lot of time riding them in the park 
 or around the roads. Some of us do    
 B.M.X. on the track. The park is      
 pretty busy with football matches and 
 training, cricket, rounders, tennis,  
 bowls, kite flying, childrens games   
 and perhaps a few squabbles or fights.
 Every day except Sunday we can go to a
 club in the park pavillion for pool,  
 table tennis and all sorts of board   
 games. There is another club twice a  
 week where we can make things, play   
 games, see films, go on outings and   
 sometimes even go camping. Some girls 
 enjoy dancing classes, boys bowing,   
 and both do martial arts. We also go  
 to Guides or Scouts. A lot of boys go 
 fishing.
