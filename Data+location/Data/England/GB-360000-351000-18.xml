		<title>18FARMING (GENERAL) IN 1985</title>
		<content>  The land in this part of south       
 Cheshire is flat, with heavy clay     
 soils. These two factors and the mild 
 damp climate mean that dairy farming  
 is important. Most of the fields are  
 permanent grass, both rough and       
 improved grazing, or ley grass. There 
 are a few fields of barley, grown for 
 winter fodder.                        
    About one field in six has dairy   
 cattle in it, at any one time.        
 Occasionally there are sheep, or a    
 bull,  in a field.                    
    Most fields are surrounded by      
 hedges and barbed wire, and some have 
 electric fences to control the        
 grazing.                              
    There are some areas of deciduous  
 trees and a few ponds.                
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
