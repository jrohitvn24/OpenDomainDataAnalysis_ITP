		<title>16BUILDING AN OIL RIG</title>
		<content> My dads name is{David Soley}he is 37  
 years old and managing director of a  
 firm called{Davy Offshore Modules.    
 Their factory is in{Middlesbrough.    
 They build parts of deep sea oil rigs.
 These rigs get oil from under the     
 sea,the oil comes up a big pipe and is
 stored in a tanker.An oil rig weighs  
 about{60,000 tons}and is{500 metres   
 high and{200 metres square.}My dad    
 doesn't actually make the rig he works
 in an office and instructs the workmen
 on which part of  the rig to build and
 how to fix the parts together.Another 
 firm comes and checks to see that it  
 is built properly and that there are  
 no cracks in the welding.Our class is 
 going to visit the works and see the  
 modules being built.
