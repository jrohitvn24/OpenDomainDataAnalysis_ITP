		<title>09A FARMERS DAY</title>
		<content>    A farmer in{West Torrington}begins 
 work at 7.30am. He starts by seeing   
 his men, and allocating the days      
 tasks. He has no stock, so he may join
 with his men in ploughing, cultivating
 or spraying, or may be occupied with  
 other jobs, such as fetching spare    
 parts, taking corn to the mill or beet
 to the sugar factory, or interviewing 
 representatives of e.g. fertilizer    
 makers or corn merchants. He has his  
 breakfast at 9.30am, a snack lunch at 
 1pm, and dinner about 5pm. Similar    
 types of work occupy the spaces       
 between meals, except at harvest,     
 which can begin in late July and      
 continue into mid-September, depending
 on the weather. Then, combining,and   
 carting the crop back to the farm     
 begins as soon as the crop is dry     
 enough in the morning, and continues  
 until the dew is too heavy at dusk.   </content>
