		<content> The village shares all its social     
 clubs with the neighbouring village of
 S Creake.  Those which meet in N      
 Creake Village Hall are the Happy     
 Circle with over 40 senior citizens,  
 and the Youth Club, which has recently
 been re-formed under new leadership.  
 The 24 members of the Mothers' Union  
 are drawn from the churches of both   
 villages.                             
 The Creakes Local History Society has 
 33 members from the two villages, and 
 has been active over the last 3 years 
 in encouraging interest in many       
 aspects of the area's past.  The      
 Women's Institute has 44 members who  
 meet in S Creake.  There are no sports
 clubs in N Creake, but funds are being
 raised to provide tennis and bowls    
 facilities.
