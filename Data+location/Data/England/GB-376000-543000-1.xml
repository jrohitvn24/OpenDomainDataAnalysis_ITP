 Weardale in county Durham from the    
 south_east. The altitude of our block 
 is 1400-1600ft.&lt;432-490 metres>making 
 it amongst the highest populated land 
 in Britain.Precipitation is 49.6inches
 &lt;1260mm>annually.Snow can lie for     
 several weeks.However the village is  
 rarely cut off by heavy snowfall.
