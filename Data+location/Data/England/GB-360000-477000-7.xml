		<title>07HOUSING IN KIRKBY LONSDALE</title>
		<content> Within Kirkby Lonsdale itself most of 
 the buildings are of{local stone}with 
{slate and tiled}roofs.Most of the     
 houses in the centre are small        
 terraced ones,often with{Georgian     
{facades}concealing older properties.  
 Over the last decade many of these    
 buildings have been renovated to make 
 very desirable residences.On the edge 
 of town small{modern estates}have been
 built at Lunefield and Fairgarth.These
 are often bungalows.As the area is    
 predominantly rural,traditional stone 
 built{farmhouses},with stone barns and
 outbuildings are dotted throughout the
 valley and on the side of the fells.  
 With the consolidation of farms,some  
 of these have fallen into disuse and  
 others have been renovated as{holiday 
{properties.
