 My uncle called Jim works on a farm   
 called Home Farm. It has 14 fields and
 altogether they make 170 acres. Most  
 of these fields get bales. This year  
 they made 5000 hay bales, which is    
 approximately 2000 hay bales down from
 other years. On this farm they have 6 
 tractors which help them bale,        
 mow, and turn the grass.They also use 
 them to get the cows in.They have 149 
 cows, 74 of them get milked.These cows
 make 1300 litres of milk which gets   
 picked up once a day by Express       
 Dairy. Thirty-one cows are ready to   
 have calves and 24 are young heifers  
 and twelve are calves. They do not    
 keep bulls.
