		<title>04   MINERS' STRIKE 1984-85</title>
		<content> Most of the nation's{coalminers}were  
 on strike for nearly a year to try to 
 stop pit closures. We asked some      
 people in {Askern}how the strike had  
 affected them.                        
     Most people who we interviewed    
 said that they wanted the strike to   
 end. They wanted the strike to end    
 because they had no money and no coal.
 Four out of fourteen said that they   
 had made more friends and one person  
 said that he had made more friends but
 had lost a few as well. A lot of      
 people were affected by the strike    
 because they had no money to go out or
 pay bills, buy sweets or biscuits. One
 person who did not want the{miners'   
{strike}to end said that they should   
 stop on to get a better deal, but he  
 was not a miner and he was not        
 affected as much as the miners.
