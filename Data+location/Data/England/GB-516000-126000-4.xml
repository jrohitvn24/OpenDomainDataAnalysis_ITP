		<title>04American Visit to Nuthurst</title>
		<content> On Friday 7th June 38 Americans came  
 to Nuthurst to stay with families in  
 the parish. They came from the        
 University Christian Church,{Fort     
{Worth, Texas.                         
 It all started in 1981 when our church
 organ started to fail playing properly
 and then the idea came up.            
 On the first night they went to a     
 reception. On the first day they      
 didn't go on any outing because they  
 were on the plane all the time,and on 
 the 2nd day they went to one place. On
 normal days they went to two or three 
 places.On the Friday they had a       
 farewell barbecue and barn dance.On   
 the second Saturday they went to the  
 school's sheep dog trial then they    
 left to go to the Tower Hotel,{London,
 where they stayed 6 days. On one day  
 they visited our School. All this was 
 to raise money for the{Building Fund. </content>
