 Our Domesday Block is traversed by an 
 important main road called the A5(T). 
 It was originally known as the London 
 to Holyhead road. A surveyor was asked
 to carefully survey the road. This    
 followed criticisms of the road       
 surface made by Members of Parliament 
 from Ireland who used the road        
 regularly. The survey was completed in
 1810. The survey included instructions
 on how to improve the road. Following 
 this the road was improved            
 considerably but it took a long time. 
 It was not completed until 1825.      
 However, by 1819 the most dangerous   
 parts had been made safe and it was   
 possible for stage coaches to use the 
 road. Just outside our block there is 
 an old coaching inn called the Lion   
 Hotel which is situated at the top of 
 Wyle Cop, Shrewsbury.                 </content>
