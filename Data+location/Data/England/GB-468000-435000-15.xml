		<title>15All Saints Church Bubwith</title>
		<content>{Bubwith All Saints Church}is situated 
 on the bank of the river Derwent.The  
 church is about 1000 years old and it 
 is made of{Tadcaster stone.}In the    
 eighteenth century the roof was ripped
 off in a fierce gale and was replaced 
 by the present oak beam roof.In the   
 stonework on the inside there are bits
 of figures like,for instance,an angel 
 on top of the alter arch,and a face on
 the north wall near the alter.Under   
 the carpet near the alter there are   
 two strange graves. They have crooked 
 crosses,skulls and cross bones on     
 them. These symbols are crooked       
 because the people who engraved them  
 without permission had to do it at the
 dead of night.
