		<title>04"ABBOTSBROOK",BOURNE END</title>
		<content>This estate is private and has always  
been so.The name Abbotsbrook comes from
the stream which runs through the      
residents' gardens and from the Abbey  
(now  three houses),which was founded  
in 1230 as a home and school for nuns. 
It is supposed to be haunted.The stream
is 3/4 of a mile long and flows round  
the estate,then into the river Thames. 
The estate was developed in 1895,when  
it was called the Abbey estate,and is  
important,because of its unique        
Edwardian development.The average age  
of an Abbotsbrook house is 50 years    
old,for now,new houses are filling in  
for old houses,and younger people have 
begun to move into the area.Most people
like living on the Abbotsbrook because 
of its privacy and river landscape.A   
group of senior residents called the   
Trustees pay for estate repairs from   
out of the Resident's Fund.            </content>
