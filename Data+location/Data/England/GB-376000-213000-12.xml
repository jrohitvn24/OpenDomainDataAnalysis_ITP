		<title>12VILLAGERS</title>
		<content>     We interviewed a number of        
 villagers (a person who has lived in  
 the same village nearly all of their  
 life). We found out that paper,milk   
 and bread are delivered to them. There
 are no shops in the area-only a mobile
 van. There is no other entertainment  
 in the area other than fetes, barn    
 dances and bands.In the winter there  
 is a whist drive once a fortnight.It  
 would be handy for the people who have
 not got a car to have one because it  
 is such a long way to go to get to a  
 shop.Some would like to see more      
 children around the area. The only    
 thing is, if there were more childeren
 there would not be anything for them  
 to play on as there aren't any parks  
 around. At home when there is nothing 
 to do they have to make up their own  
 entertainment.
