On Sunday morning I helped mum do the  
spring cleaning. I cleaned the cooker, 
polished the television and lots more. 
At lunch time I had beef,potatoes,     
cauliflower and Yorkshire pudding. In  
the afternoon, I did a lot. I played   
with my friend Hayley, we had a        
plastic  barrel which we tried to walk 
on but kept falling off. I also went   
to Towcester to see my Nan and Pop,    
they gave me a drink of Coca Cola and  
one pound. My dad took all day to put  
the finishing touches to our new       
windows. My mum spent most of the day  
cleaning and ironing.
