 status by a charter from Queen        
 Elizabeth 1 and has had a Mayor ever  
 since.The present Mayor is Mr.Eric

 before the General Election of 1983

 responsibility for this area is       
 Mr,David Mitchell.                    
   We who have taken part in the survey
 that Whitchurch will never change     
 dramatically,and that it will always  
 continue to be a very pleasant country
 town both in which to work and live.
