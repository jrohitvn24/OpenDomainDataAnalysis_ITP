		<title>12RELIGION IN NETHERBURY</title>
		<content>  There are 3 churches, all Anglican,  
 in Beaminster, Netherbury and Stoke   
 Abbott.  Services in these churches   
 and in 11 other churches in           
 surrounding villages, are conducted by
 members of a team ministry known as   
 the "Beam Team".  There are 3 full    
 time parish priests, 4 retired clergy 
 and 5 lay readers;  these 5 are       
 trained and licensed and can lead     
 morning and evening prayer, assist at 
 Communion and conduct funerals.  There
 is at least one service per church    
 every Sunday and mid week worship     
 takes place in private homes.  The    
 Bishop of Salisbury said in 1982 "The 
 most wonderful thing of all about your
 Beaminister Team is that it is written
 into your charter that you are not an 
 organisation run from the top, or     
 centre, but a sharing partnership to  
 which all contributions are welcomed".</content>
