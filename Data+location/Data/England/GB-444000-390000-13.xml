		<title>13ROADS AROUND HERRINGTHORPE</title>
		<content> Around the area of east Rotherham     
 the land is mainly residential.The    
 roads around the area are very busy   
 too.In Whiston and Wickersley there   
 are new estates being built making the
 villages bigger.                      
  The three main roads in the area are 
 Herringthorpe Vallley Road which is   
 the A6123, Wickersley Road which is   
 the A6021,and East Bawtry Road which  
 is the  A631.                         
  Herringthorpe Valley Road is         
 probably the most busy of them all.   
 They are having alot of trouble with  
 the crossing because there are two    
 schools on the road.Recently they have
 put islands in the middle,so crossing 
 is easier.The road runs from          
 Worrygoose island up to the Stag and  
 then down to Eastwood.On Herringthorpe
 Valley road there are two petrol      
 stations,one with a car on top.       </content>
