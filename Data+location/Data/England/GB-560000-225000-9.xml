		<title>09TRANSPORT IN GREAT EASTON</title>
		<content> In Great Easton there are no shops,   
 only one pub and a church.The nearest 
 shop is in Duton Hill but most people 
 shop in Dunmow or Bishop's Stortford. 
 Because of this and a lack of buses   
 most people have a car.We counted the 
 traffic into and out of Great Easton  
 between 1.25pm &amp; 1.55pm on June 11th. 
 We saw 12 cars and 2 vans going to    
 Great Easton &amp; 7 cars, 2 vans,1 lorry,
 1 motorbike, leaving.                 
          PUBLIC TRANSPORT             
 42 buses serve Gt.Easton per week.    
 There are 7 a day which are           
 approximately 2 hours apart.Buses go  
 along the Lt.Easton-Tilty road and    
 stop above the ford.There are 7 buses 
 each way Monday-Friday and 5 on       
 Saturdays .Heningham omnibus service  
 333 runs 1 bus to and from Dunmow on  
 Thursdays,9.55pm-11.45am which stops  
 near the school.                      </content>
