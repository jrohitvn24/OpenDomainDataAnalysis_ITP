		<content> There is no public transport. Primary 
 school children are taken to Caldbeck 
 School by minibus. Coach transport is 
 provided for the secondary age group  
 to Caldew School, Dalston. Most people
 own or have access to a private car   
 for other journeys. There is a        
 voluntary car service which can be    
 used for hospital appointments or     
 visiting. The Mountain Goat minibus   
 travels through the area from its base
 in Keswick during the summer season.  
                                       
 There is a telephone kiosk at         
 Fellside but most homes are also      
 connected to the telephone service.   
 The post is delivered daily by mail   
 van from Wigton (16km). Post boxes at 
 Fellside and Parkend are cleared once 
 daily. The nearest post office is at  
 Caldbeck. Most families take the local
 monthly community magazine.           </content>
