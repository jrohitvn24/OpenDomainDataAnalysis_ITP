		<content>    Most people probably think that    
 young people wear blue denim jeans.   
 We decided to investigate the fashion 
 trends.                               
                                       
    We wrote to local fashion clothes  
 shops and found that most women wear  
 pastel shades and the most popular    
 sizes were 12 and 14 with a fair      
 number of 10 and 16.   Skirts, tops   
 and dresses were sold the most.       
                                       
    The most popular sizes in shirts   
 for men were 15 and 16, waist sizes 32
 and 34 and leg length 31 and 32.  The 
 colours for men were also pastel      
 shades and, surprisingly, a large     
 number of mens' pink tops were sold.  
                                       
    Looking around at what people are  
 wearing tends to confirm that pastels 
 are the "in" colour. What for 1986?   </content>
