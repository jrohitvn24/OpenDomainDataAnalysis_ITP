		<title>19BALDON HOUSE, MARSH BALDON</title>
		<content>Since we first came to Baldon House 30 
years ago, many changes have taken     
place.  In those days it was a 'Country
Gentleman's Private Estate' with a big 
staff inside and out,horses,cattle,tied
cottages and a kitchen garden which    
supplied all needs.                    
In winter the local Hunt met on the    
front lawn,and in summer there were    
fetes and horse shows.                 
Alas,due to economic circumstances,it  
is now very different. From being the  
'Big House' it is three establishments.
The old garage and grain store is now a
modern house,the owners coming from    
London. The West Wing is converted into
another unit occupied by an American   
family. The original owner lives in the
middle. The staff has been reduced, and
the fields leased to a local farmer.   
The woods and lake remain the same but 
permits are required for fishing.      </content>
