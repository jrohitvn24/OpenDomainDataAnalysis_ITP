		<content>   Varied sources of energy are        
 used.Mains{electricity}is the most    
 common source and is used for cooking,
 heating and lighting.                 
   The open fireplace is more often for
 decoration than use but some people   
 use{solid fuels}for central heating.  
   Town{gas}is not yet piped to our    
 area but is regarded as the cheapest  
 form of heating and cooking.          
   Very occasionly{bottled gas}and     
{paraffin}are used for heating.        
   Now that{oil}is so expensive not    
 many people use it. Four houses have  
{solar panels}to obtain free hot water.
   Outside the house{electricity}is    
 used for small tools(mowers) whereas  
 petrol is used for larger ones        
 (diggers).Cars and lorries use petrol 
 or diesel, a few, electricity.Wind    
 power is used for pumping water and   
 sailing.                              </content>
