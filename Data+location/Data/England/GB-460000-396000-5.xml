		<content>     New Rossington to the east of the 
 settlement, was designed as a 'garden 
 village' for colliery workers and for 
 many years was thought of as a good   
 example of town planning, it has an   
 unusual design with the roads and     
 houses in concentric circles.  The    
 first pit houses were built in the    
 1920's they are mostly in terraces or 
 small blocks each with its own garden.
     Some of the streets are named     
 after men involved with the opening of
 the coal mine _ Norman, Deacon, Ellis,
 McConnel, Firth and Streatfeild.      
      After the Second World War three 
 new housing estates were built for the
 Council and the National Coal Board.  
     The facilities, for the community 
 include a shopping centre, market,    
 welfare club, sports grounds,         
 churches, memorial hall, health centre
 and library.                          </content>
