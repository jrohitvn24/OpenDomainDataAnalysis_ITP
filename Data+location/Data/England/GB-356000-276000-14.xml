		<title>14       INDUSTRY</title>
		<content>      One of the industries in our     
 area is a poultry farm. They have     
 21000  chickens.Ventilation is        
 very important so there are{21}fans,{1
 fan to every {1000}birds. The heat    
 in the building is produced from the  
 birds being so close together.On some 
 days eggs are graded. This is done by 
 putting a tray of eggs on to a moving 
 belt, automatic suckers then pick up  
 the eggs and gently drop them on to   
 another moving belt, the eggs then    
 roll off into little dishes which     
 weighs the eggs.They then roll off to 
 the correct graded collecting         
 point.When the chickens first come to 
 the farm they lay about{18000 }eggs   
 per day, then just before they leave  
 they lay about{15000 }eggs per day.The
 birds stay at the farm for just over a
 year, 12 to 13 months.
