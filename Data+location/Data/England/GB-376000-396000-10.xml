		<content> Liverpool Rd. (A57) is the main       
 street, extending from Eccles centre  
 to Peel Green, although there is a gap
 in the shops of about half a mile,    
 towards Eccles. In the nineteenth     
 century the area grew more rapidly    
 than Eccles and developed small       
 independent department stores.        
 Nowadays, these stores have been      
 swamped by supermarkets in Eccles and 
 have a job to survive. There are still
 a lot of pubs, restaurants and snack  
 bars, etc. mainly of the cheaper sort,
 catering for workmen at lunchtime     
 rather than for people going out in   
 the evening. There are a number of    
 Indian and Chinese 'take-aways' which 
 only sell food to take out. There are 
 many vacant shops with peeling paint  
 and dirty windows. Other shops sell   
 greengroceries, confectionery, car    
 spare parts and DIY goods.            </content>
