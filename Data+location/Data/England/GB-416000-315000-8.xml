		<content>A main railway line,A38 road and the   
Trent and Mersey canal run through the 
area. The railway line carries both    
passengers and freight from the        
directions of Burton and Tamworth.The  
canal is now essentially for holiday   
barges.The A38,originally Rykneld St., 
is now a very busy dual carriageway.   
This summer the southbound carriageway 
from Barton to Wychnor was closed for  
repair and a contraflow system         
operated. A traffic survey  showed that
the majority of vehicles were cars.Next
were  long distance heavy  goods       
lorries,carrying mainly food or        
building  materials.There were several 
local light vans.225 cars were recorded
in twenty minutes in one direction one 
Monday morning.This was the largest    
number recorded in any category.
