		<title>02A LIFETIME IN UTTOXETER</title>
		<content>Mrs. Whitehead was born in Smithfield  
Road in 1907. She remembers a          
German airship over her house in the   
1st World War. Her father worked at    
Bamfords.When he returned he set up a  
factory band to advertise Bamfords. She
remembers going outside to see the     
first car.She thought it was           
amazing.On bank holidays her family    
went on picnics in a horse drawn       
carriage called a brake. The biggest   
changes for her are gas,electricity    
and travel. She had to collect         
firewood for her family and pump       
water. For many years Bamfords used a  
'blower' to say it was time for work.  
Everyone in town used it to tell the   
time. For a while she walked to school 
from Bramshall. Sometimes they would   
run after the milk cart and jump o the 
back for a lift.Now  it would be       
too dangerous for children.            </content>
