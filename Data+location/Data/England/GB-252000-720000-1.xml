		<title>01THE SCENERY OF BALQUHIDDER</title>
		<content>   There are a lot of trees in         
 Balquhidder, because most of the      
 landscape is forestry. There are      
 deciduous trees and coniferous trees. 
 The deciduous trees are scattered     
 about and the coniferous are grown in 
 clumps. The land round here is very   
 hilly and quite a few houses are built
 on the hills. A lot of the landscape  
 belongs to the hill farmers who use   
 it to graze their sheep.              
   The area abounds in wild flowers and
 in Autumn wild fruits.                
   There is a little tarmac road which 
 winds its way right up the scenic glen
 to Inverlocharich, passing on the way 
 two lochs, Loch Voil and Loch Doine.  
 From Loch Voil the Balvaig river      
 meanders its way to Loch Lubnaig.     
 Apart from the new forests Balquhidder
 looks very similar today to what it   
 did 100 years ago.                    </content>
