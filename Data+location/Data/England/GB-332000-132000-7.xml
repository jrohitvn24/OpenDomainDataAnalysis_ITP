		<content>   The fifteenth century church, whose 
 tower dominates the village was used  
 to house captured prisoners after the 
 most important local event            
 historically. This was The{Battle of  
{Sedgemoor in 1685.}The last battle    
 fought on English soil,between{King   
{James the second;the Catholic King,   
 and{James,Duke of}Monmouth,the        
{Protestant}claimant to the throne and 
 King James's nephew.The Duke landed at
{Lyme Regis}and after travelling around
 the West of England with his poorly   
 trained army,attacked the Royalist    
 Army, camped behind the Bussex        
 rhyne outside the village in the early
 hours of July the sixth.The mainly    
 civilian army of the Duke,with their  
 crude weapons,were no match for the   
 Royalists ,all professional           
 soldiers,and Monmouth's men were      
 defeated in a gruesome bloodbath.     </content>
