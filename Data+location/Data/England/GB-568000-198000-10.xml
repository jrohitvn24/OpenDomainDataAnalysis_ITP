		<title>10Health care in Stock</title>
		<content> There are two doctors in Stock their  
 names are Doctor Warden and Doctor    
 Coffin,the doctor's surgery is in the 
 High Street.They haven't any chemists 
 in Stock so the doctors make their own
 medicine up,they have their own       
 pharmacy.I don't think many people    
 have to go to the doctors because     
 there isn't pollution(well not too    
 much) .Doctor Coffin used to work with
 Doctor Death,now Doctor Coffin works  
 with Doctor Warden,who is a lady      
 doctor who specialises in women's     
 medicine or gynaecology.The nearest   
 general hospital is in Chelmsford.    
 there distric nurse,and distric       
 Midwife and health visitor in Stock.
