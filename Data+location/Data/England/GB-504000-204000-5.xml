		<title>05EDUCATION IN HEMEL HEMPSTEAD</title>
		<content> There are only primary and secondary  
 schools in this area. We have to go   
 into Watford or Hemel for college.    
 Children go to the Infants at five.   
 They do Maths and use Unifix cubes to 
 help them. They have a lady to help   
 with their reading. We go into the    
 Juniors between seven and eleven. When
 you move up to a new class you        
 have a lot of tests and when you move 
 to Secondary school. We do topics,    
 language, maths and PE. We transfer to
 secondary in our twelfth year. Most   
 people go to Longdean or Mountbatten. 
 You study for your 'O' and 'A' levels 
 there. When you leave at 16 or 18 you 
 either get a job or go to university, 
 depending on your qualifications. Some
 people go to private schools. The one 
 in this area is called Abbots Hill.   
 Pupils go there from 4 to 18. Some    
 schools wear uniform, but not all.    </content>
