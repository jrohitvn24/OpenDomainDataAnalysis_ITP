		<title>07WEASENHAM POND</title>
		<content>  The Anglo Saxon word "waes" means    
 water which indicates that Weasenham  
 means "a dwelling near water".There is
 evidence of underlying water all      
 around and the pond is part of the    
 drainage system for this area.It has  
 been here for 200 hundred years.About 
 10 years ago the pond was cleared of  
 weed which was placed in the middle to
 make an island.Last year some farmers 
 built up the island with stones and   
 soil and put wood around it to stop it
 collapsing into the pond.In hot       
 weather the pond dries out.           
  Mallard and Aylesbury ducks and grey 
 farmyard geese can be seen there and a
 heron and little grebe have been      
 sighted.                              
  Rachel and Helen did a bird count on 
 June 20th 1985.
