		<title>07ST.FAITH'S CHURCH OVERBURY</title>
		<content> St.Faith's Church,Overbury,is quite   
 large for the size of the village. It 
 is rectangular in shape and has a Bell
 Tower.It is an old church,the nave    
 being the oldest part,built in the    
 time of the{Normans.}The rest of the  
 building is between five and eight    
 hundred years old.There is a very     
{Ancient Stone Font}with some interes- 
 ting carvings on it.{Two Consecration 
{Crosses}painted in red,dating from the
 middle ages,can still be seen on the  
 walls of the chancel.We all walked    
 around the church to an outside door  
 to climb up the Bell Tower.The stairs 
 were very steep,narrow and winding. We
 felt excited and scared, our legs felt
 shaky like jelly.The bells were bigger
 than we expected. It was a relief to  
 reach the top. The village looked very
 different from above.Most of us found 
 it even worse going back down.        </content>
