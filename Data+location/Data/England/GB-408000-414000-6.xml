		<title>06Farming in the Colne Valley</title>
		<content>    The Colne Valley is a semi- rural  
 area with lots of small farms on the  
 hilltops and valley sides. Because of 
 the climate and soil most of the farms
 have dairy herds and sheep.           
    The Roberts' farm at Linthwaite is 
 typical of the area. It is a dairy    
 farm of 100 acres, 50% being used for 
 grazing a herd of 50 friesian cows,   
 and 50% used for growing hay and      
 silage.Winter for the farmer starts in
 late October when the cows are brought
 indoors and lasts approximately 200   
 days.                                 
    The herd produces 150 gallons a day
 of which two thirds is bottled at the 
 farm and is delivered daily by the    
 farmer to houses in the locality. The 
 rest of his milk goes to produce      
 cream.
