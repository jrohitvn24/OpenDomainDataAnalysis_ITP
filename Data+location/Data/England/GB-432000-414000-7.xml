		<title>07Newmillerdam Country Park</title>
		<content>   A major part of the landscape of our
 area is covered by the Newmillerdam   
 Country Park.Situated next to the main
 Wakefield-Barnsley Road (A6l) the Park
 provides an area of great beauty.     
 Deciduous woodlands surround a lake   
 which contains 30 million gallons of  
 water.  Beside the lake Newmillerdam  
 village maintains its character as it 
 sits against the hill side.           
  As might be expected the area is not 
 only popular with the local people    
 but also with many species of         
 animals,birds and fish. Despite being 
 close to an industrial area the       
 environment does not appear to be     
 suffering.                            
  Such is the attraction of the Park   
 that it has recently been estimated   
 that there are over a quarter of a    
 million visitors to the Park per year.
