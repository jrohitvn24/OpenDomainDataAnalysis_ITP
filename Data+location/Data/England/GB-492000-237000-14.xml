		<title>14BUILDINGS OF INTEREST</title>
		<content> Buildings of architectural interest in
 the area include the two churches, St.
 Mary's , Salford and St. Nicholas at  
 Hulcote. St.Mary's, an early l3th     
 Century structure having leaded       
 windows and an unusual entrance porch 
 the upper part of which being of wood.
 A Tudor Rose and two contemporary     
 symbols are carved upon a wooden beam 
 over the door. The date 1633 is       
 carved on a rafter and is thought to  
 refer to repairs done to the porch in 
 that year. The 14th century church of 
 St. Nicholas stands at the end of an  
 avenue of lime trees. An interesting  
 feature of the church is the nail     
 studded door, the handle of which is  
 inscribed "R.C." Rook Tree Farm House 
 near the church was the Dower House of
 the vanished manor of Hulcote, a      
 signpost indicates its wherabouts at  
 the end of a lane.                    </content>
