		<title>10Names in the Chinnor area</title>
		<content>   Domesday Book mentions 'Chenore',   
 one meaning given being 'village over 
 the hill'.                            
   Icknield Way or Ridgeway, is a      
 prehistoric route following the       
 contours of the Chilterns.The name is 
 thought to come from the Iceni, a     
 tribe of East Anglia. There is another
 Icknield Way running through Chinnor  
 which is a parallel route at a lower  
 level. Mill Lane School lies on this  
 road; here called Mill Lane because of
 the windmill that was once there.     
   Domesday alludes to 'Sidreham'. The 
 name is thought to mean 'by the wide  
 river meadow'. Emmington was derived  
 from 'Amyngton' or 'Eama's Farm'-     
 Saxon.                                
   In the recent past, an Emmington    
 shepherd died whose name was Joe      
 Malin-there is still a 'Malin         
 Cottage' in Emmington.(cont)          </content>
