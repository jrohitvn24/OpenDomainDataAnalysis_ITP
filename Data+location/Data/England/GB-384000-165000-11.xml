		<content>  TRANSPORT_ECOLOGY                    
  Transport is easy with most families 
 being car owners.A regular bus service
 connects Atworth with Bath,Corsham and
 Melksham.Bikes are also very popular  
 with the Wiltshire Cycleway,which     
 rings the county,going through the    
 village.                              
  The main A365 bisects the village and
 speeding is a problem,possibly the    
 major one for the community policeman.
  Many footpaths cross the area and all
 are wellmarked but little used.There  
 is a feeling that recently these      
 footpaths are being walked more often 
 as people become conscious of the     
 countryside and rights of access.
