		<title>05ST FELIX CHURCH, FELIXKIRK</title>
		<content>  This is one of eight churches and two
 other places of worship in the        
 Hillside Parishes. The priest in      
 charge is the vicar of Knayton.       
  At Felixkirk there are 57 people on  
 the electoral roll. Holy Communion is 
 celebrated on the 1st and 3rd Sundays 
 in the month at 9.15am.Festival       
 Evensong is held on special occasions 
 such as Harvest time and St Felix day.
  There is a movement abroad for the   
 Hillside Parishes to enter into the   
 Eccumenical Project with the Methodist
 Church, whereby the Anglican churches 
 and the Methodist chapels retained,   
 would become shared buildings, thus   
 having one shared place of worship in 
 each village, but this has not yet    
 been approved officially.
