		<content> I was woken at 6am by the alarm on my 
 wristwatch &amp; went to my desk to do    
 some homework. While I finished it my 
 Dad made me two slices of toast       
 My Mum ironed my neckerchief for Cubs 
 She washed my hair,when it was dry I  
 went &amp; played football with my brother
 until our Dad came to fetch us for    
 dinner which was  carrots,potatoes &amp;  
 cabbage.I don't eat meat.             
 After dinner I put on my Cub uniform  
 &amp; got the Cub flag. I was to carry the
 flag at the St.George's Day parade at 
 Central Hall Coventry. At 1.45 I met  
 the Coventry Cub packs at the         
 Coventry Poly. Coll.car park &amp; marched
 to Central Hall. The flag bearers     
 lined the stairs while the guests went
 in.Then we walked up the aisle with   
 our flags,laid them against the wall  
 &amp; sat down. Afterwards we assembled   
 with our flags &amp; were dismissed.      </content>
