		<title>05Local History 2 - Yardley</title>
		<content>The original settlements of both these 
ancient manors in our block were on    
isolated patches of lighter glacial    
soil surrounded by the north-eastern   
fringes of the forest of Arden.        
Yardley's first mention in history was 
in king Edgar's Charter of 972 giving  
the manor to Pershore abbey.By this    
time there were five small farms here, 
and the place was called Gyrdleane-a   
small clearing.                        
The original settlement in Sheldon was 
at Mackadown,named in the Domesday Book
as Machitone-macca's farm.             
Together they had about 1.6 recorded   
adults per square mile.They both had at
least 7 square miles of woodland out of
a total of just over 14 square miles.  
There was only enough cleared arable   
land to use 10plough teams.            
Yardley became part of Birmingham in   
1911 and Sheldon in 1931.              </content>
