		<title>10TRIP TO GLENHOLT</title>
		<content> At Glenholt the first thing we saw was
 the George pub, it sold ales and had a
 place for children. Its car park had a
 telephone booth near. We walked on and
 came to some houses, which had a      
 barrier of trees and bushes to protect
 the people from noise and car fumes.  
 There was a parking space outside the 
 houses where there was a lot of       
 litter.                               
 Nearby was a big green metal storer   
 which kept gravel for melting the     
 snow. Next we came to a garage selling
 fuel and diesel, it also had a mini   
 shop which sold garden furniture,     
 sweets, lemonade, toys and other      
 things. We crossed the road and walked
 downan old football pitch. This had a 
 hut at the bottom which was the       
 changing room. We then walk to Buena  
 Vista and further on was open land and
 moors.                                </content>
