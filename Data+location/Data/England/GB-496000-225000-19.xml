		<title>19TRANSPORT ANALYSIS,HOCKLIFFE</title>
		<content>  When we visited{Hockliffe}to survey  
 the amenities we were very aware of   
 the huge amount of traffic passing    
 through the village. We returned on   
{5th.July, 1985}and carried out a      
{traffic survey}at the crossroads in   
 Hockliffe where the{A5}meets the{A4012
 and the{B528.}For results see{A5      
{TRAFFIC CENSUS,HOCKLIFFE              
  We expected to find that most of the 
 traffic was moving along the A5 and   
 passing through Hockliffe but we soon 
 discovered that a large amount of     
 traffic was actually joining or       
 leaving the A5 at this point, mainly  
 to or from{Leighton Buzzard.          
  Most of the traffic joining the A5   
 from Leighton Buzzard went in a       
 southerly direction towards{Dunstable.
{ A lot of amenities in Hockliffe seem 
{to exist to service this traffic.
