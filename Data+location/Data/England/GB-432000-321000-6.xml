		<content>{A school day}                         
  I get up at half-past seven.I get    
 dressed and have a wash. Then I have  
 breakfast, pack my bag and go to      
 school. The bell goes at nine o'clock.
 We have the register and then go to   
 assembly. We sing hymns and have a    
 story.                                
  After assembly we do Maths or English
 for an hour. We have a playtime and   
 after that we do Maths or English     
 depending on what we did before play. 
  At twelve o'clock we have dinner. We 
 come back in the class at half past   
 one and do topic, craft, music, hymn  
 practice or games. We have playtime at
 half past two. Then we work until half
 past three and finish with a story.   
  At home I have tea, change my clothes
 and then I might go out to play, or to
 Cubs or Brownies or swimming. I go to 
 bed between nine and ten o'clock.     </content>
