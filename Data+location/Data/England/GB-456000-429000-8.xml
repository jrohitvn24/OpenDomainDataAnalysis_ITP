		<content> Brayton Barff is a small sandstone    
 hill to the west of Selby and just to 
 the south of Thorpe Willoughby. Barff 
 is a local word for a small hill. This
 hill is of great interest in the area 
 as it is one of the few landmarks in  
 an otherwise flat landscape. The Barff
 is covered in mixed woodland and also 
 contains the Y.W.A. storage reservoir 
 for the Selby area.                   
 Part of the Barff is a nature reserve 
 and a nature trail has been marked out
 with numbered stones. The trail starts
 at a small car park on Barff Lane.    
 Along the trail can be seen large oaks
 and sycamores and in the spring the   
 hills are covered in bluebells. There 
 is also a coniferous plantation with  
 Scots Pines and Norway Spruce. The    
 woods are inhabited by grey           
 squirrels,foxes and rabbits as well as
 a profusion of birds,notably the jay. </content>
