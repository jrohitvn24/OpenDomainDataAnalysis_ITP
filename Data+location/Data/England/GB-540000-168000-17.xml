		<title>172 Milk Street Bromley.</title>
		<content>   My name is Lee, I live with my mum  
dad, sister and pet rabbit at 2,Milk   
Street , Bromley, which is a council   
house built in 1962.I am 10 and I go   
to Burnt Ash Junior School.I enjoy     
cycling, playing cricket and football. 
   My class looked at some old maps.   
Milk Street is very old, it is on the  
Rocque map of 1744. It led from Burnt  
Ash Lane to the Dairy farm,which is    
why it is called "Milk Street."        
   Before 1962,the address"2,Milk      
Street" belonged to a farm cottage.At  
the library I found out who used to    
live there. In 1841 it was the Bridger 
family, and in 1861 Mr. and Mrs.       
Marshall and their nephew,a "garden    
boy", lived there. In the 1930's Mrs   
Rose ran a dairy from this address.    
   I think my life is very different   
from those of the other children who   
have lived at 2, Milk Street.          </content>
