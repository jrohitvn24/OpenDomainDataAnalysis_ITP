		<title>08Employment around Himbleton</title>
		<content>      The major employers throughout   
 the area are farmers who employ about 
 10% of the local population plus a    
 number who reside outside the area.   
 Other places of employment comprise   
 for example of Himbleton Manor ,      
 School and garage , and the Galton    
 Arms.                                 
      About 12% of the population are  
 retired and there are a small number  
 unemployed. The majority of the       
 working population find work outside  
 the area in nearby towns and cities.  
 Some housewives who are not           
 specifically employed do have         
 part-time work.                       
      Some seasonal work is available  
 at harvest time through arable farming
 and fruit picking and at Christmas    
 with turkeys.
