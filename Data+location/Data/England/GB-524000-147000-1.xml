 the area forms part of the Low Weald  
 of Surrey;the underlying rock being   
 clay.The northern third sits astride  
 the Lower Greensand Ridge;the         
 substratum being sandstone.           
         Half of the area is farmland. 
 Of the remainder,half is common land, 
 and the rest is occupied by houses;   
 the majority built between{1840}and   
{1975}and 25% of them local authority  
 owned.
