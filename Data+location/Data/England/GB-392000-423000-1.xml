		<title>01Todmorden-Our Town</title>
		<content>   Todmorden is a small, Pennine town  
 in West Yorkshire.A large proportion  
 of its population of 14,500 are       
 elderly.                              
   We have alot of old, terraced houses
 and mills.The mills used to make      
 cotton.Many of them are now empty and 
 derelict, or have changed their use.  
   There is a street full of shops,    
 three supermarkets, and an indoor and 
 outdoor market which is open on       
 Wednesday, Friday and Saturday.       
   Todmorden has a big park with a     
 playground near a football pitch.There
 are quite a few paths leading to crazy
 golf, tennis courts, bowling greens,  
 swimming baths, and a cafe.The hills  
 around Todmorden are excellent for    
 walking with the Calderdale and       
 Pennine Ways nearby.                  
   The recently restored canal has boat
 runs in summer.                       </content>
