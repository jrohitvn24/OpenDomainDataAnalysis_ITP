		<title>19Dartmoor Weather</title>
		<content> Apart from the Lake District, Dartmoor
 is the wettest and, possibly, the     
 bleakest area in England.             
  It has an annual average rainfall of 
 90 inches and an annual average       
 temperature of 50 degrees F. In 1982  
 the rainfall was 87.58ins; in 1983 it 
 was 77.79ins and in 1984 (a good      
 summer) it was 76.49ins.              
  The heaviest rainfall occurs in the  
 winter months but summers can be wet  
 too.                                  
  The greatest inconvenience to someone
 living here, though, is not the amount
 of rain but the occurrence of low     
 lying mist which can blanket the moor 
 for several days on end or the snow   
 and ice in winter which can make      
 travelling hazardous or impossible.   
  However, when the weather is kind    
 Dartmoor is, indeed, very beautiful   
 and a clean and healthy place to live.</content>
