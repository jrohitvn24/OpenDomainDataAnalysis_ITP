		<title>06GRAND UNION CANAL</title>
		<content>{Canals}were built is the 18th century 
 Industrial Revolution to move products
 and materials to and from markets at a
 time when roads were in a very poor   
 state. {The Grand Union Canal         
 connected the River Thames in London  
 to Birmingham in the heart of the     
 industrial Midlands.  It had many     
 locks, was 200km long and was ready in
 1805.  The branch from Paddington to  
 Southall was 20km long, had no locks  
 and so made the link faster.  The     
 canal was built at a time of cheap    
 labour (mainly Irishmen) using picks, 
 shovels, pulleys, wheel-barrows and   
 horses.  Clay was puddled on the      
 pervious bottom.  Wooden posts        
 supported the sides.  Brickearth soil 
 dug up was used for the building to   
 expand London. {The canal brought     
{industry and people}to once rural     
 villages like Greenford and Northolt. </content>
