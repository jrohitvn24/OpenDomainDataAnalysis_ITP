		<content> Dollis Brook is in the south eastern  
 corner of our block. On both sides of 
 the brook are open spaces of          
 cultivated grass land. The northern   
 section slopes down to the brook and  
 is bounded in the north by housing. To
 the south of the brook the open space 
 stretches well into the existing      
 block. The stream at its deepest point
 which we studied was as much as 50cm  
 and 3.5 metres wide. The speed of the 
 water was one metre per 11 seconds.   
 Man's presence was noticed in the area
 in the form of rubbish strewn in the  
 brook. Some items found were a        
 mattress and a punctured football.    
 This rubbish was fortunately not too  
 conspicuous. The brookside area is    
 used by local people for leisure      
 activities such as walking, picnicing,
 playing in, practicing golf.
