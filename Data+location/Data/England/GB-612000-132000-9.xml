		<title>09Converted Martello Tower</title>
		<content>  One Martello Tower has been converted
 into a house. At one time all the     
 floors were knocked out and replaced, 
 which you can see, because instead of 
 the normal 3 floors there are 4. The  
 basement has 4 rooms, the ground floor
 has 4 rooms also, and the first floor 
 only has 3 rooms. Where the cannon    
 should be they have put in a sun deck 
 and a sunroom. In the sunroom on the  
 floor is a mosaic of the coast line   
 and where the Tower stands.           
                                       
  Before 1960 there was an attempt to  
 convert the Tower, but they failed and
 in about 1960 a popular architect     
 bought the Tower and converted it into
 a comfy home. This Tower had a ditch  
 around it instead of a movable ladder 
 which you can tell because of the very
 low garden. It is being sold at the   
 moment for seventy thousand pounds.   </content>
