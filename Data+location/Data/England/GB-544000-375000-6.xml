 men, 22 in arable, and 6 in dairy

 farming is done by machinery, large   
 tractors, plough, sow and harvest.    
 Aeroplanes spray as well as tractors. 
 Peaviners cut, gather and pod the     
 peas. They are taken to be            
 washed, chilled at the farm. Then sent
 to the factory.{Mr Middleton}is the
