		<title>09Farming around Much Wenlock.</title>
		<content> Around{Much Wenlock}there are many    
{arable farms}but few dairy farms.     
 We interviewed{one typical local      
{farmer}living in{Much Wenlock.        
 His farm is between{600 and 700 acres.
 He has{42 fields of crops}including   
{wheat, barley, sugar beet}and{peas}for
 cattle fodder.                        
 He has a{pedigree herd}of{285         
{Herefords.}He sells his cattle,       
 but rarely buys them. If he buys      
 cattle they have to go into quarantine
 for 21 days. He visits Bridgnorth     
 market and occasionally, Shrewsbury   
 market.                               
 On the farm there are{four tractors,  
{two ploughs}and{one combine harvester.
 The busiest time of the year is{July  
{to November.}That is when{combining,  
{ploughing}and{drilling}have to be     
 done.                                 
                                       </content>
