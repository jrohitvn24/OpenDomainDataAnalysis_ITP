		<title>13STREET LANE,RIPLEY.</title>
		<content> On Street Lane there are four         
 farms.Iron Works Farm,Strelley Court  
 Farm Morley Park Farm and Sandown     
 Farm.On Iron Works Farm there is also 
 a caravan site.Strelly Court Farm is  
 disused and we had a look at it.There 
 was some machinery in some of the     
 buildings.Most of the land round      
 Street Lane is used for farming.The   
 road called Street Lane was built by  
 the Romans.It is Hundreds of years    
 old.Now a days people live on it ,play
 on it and drive their cars on it.The  
 fields by Street Lane are going to be 
 outcropped by digging for coal.The A38
 is the biggest road on our map.We went
 through some roads and came to a sort 
 of dead end where we rested and a fox 
 crossed the path.No one saw the fox   
 but everyone smelt it.We did pass some
 barley,wheat and mowing grass(for     
 silage or hay).                       </content>
