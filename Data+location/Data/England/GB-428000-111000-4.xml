		<content> At {Bartley Middle School}a wide      
 curriculum is followed. The basic     
 subjects; Mathematics, English and    
 Religious Studies, are taught using   
 Work Cards in preference to text      
 books. Project work also takes place, 
 covering History, Geographry and      
 Nature. Use is also made of television
 programmes to assist in this. Music is
 taught by a specialist teacher        
 throughout the school.                
    School rules are kept to a minimum 
 and are only made to aid the safety of
 the pupils, eg. No running in the     
 corridors. Toys are banned to prevent 
 loss of valubles. The School does not 
 have a set uniform. The chilren may   
 wear any combination of white, red,   
 black, yellow and grey.               
    The one important occasion in the  
 school year is Sports Day             
                                       </content>
