		<title>15HOUSING IN TYWARDREATH</title>
		<content> In our 12 sq. km we have 11 sq. km    
 which have very few houses, there are 
 only scattered farms nearly all fairly
 old.                                  
{The 1 sq. km which is left is full of 
{houses which make the village of      
{Tywardreath.}The houses grew out from 
 the church. The oldest houses are near
 the church. These houses have no      
 garages, no front gardens and are     
 terraced. Most were built of granite. 
 Gradually more houses were built, just
 one or two at a time. These houses    
 were quite big and had big gardens.   
 Since the war in 1945 a big expansion 
 has been made. More houses have been  
 built since 1945 than all the other   
 houses put together. First Poldrea, a 
 council housing estate, with 66       
 houses. In the last 15 years 2 private
 estates have been built with gardens  
 and somewhere to park the car.        </content>
