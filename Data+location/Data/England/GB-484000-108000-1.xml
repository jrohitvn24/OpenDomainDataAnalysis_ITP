		<title>01The Village of Lavant</title>
		<content> The village of Lavant is placed two   
 miles north of Chichester and is      
 surrounded by downland and            
 farmland. It has a village hall placed
 in the centre                         
  of East Lavant.It also               
 has two churches, one in East Lavant  
 called St. Marys and the other in Mid 
 Lavant named St. Nicholas. Most people
 go out of the village to work but some
 work on the local farms and on a small
  industrial estate in Mid             
 Lavant.Lavant has a small river which 
 starts in the woods at East Dean,and  
 usually flows from about November     
 until July or August.The population   
 is approximately 1500 people.Although 
 there are many people who have lived  
 in the village all their lives,       
 because of new house building there   
 are lots of new young families who    
 have moved into the village.          </content>
