		<title>13CHEDWORTH ROMAN VILLA -TODAY</title>
		<content>  {  The   extensive  remains   of  the
{Romano  British  villa   make  it  one
{of the best known in the country. }The
 remains  are  on   three  sides  of  a
 courtyard,  with the{mosaic floors and
{bath houses of particular interest.The
{National Trust}has owned it since 1924
 and  being {one  of its  most  visited
{possessions has  caused some problems.
{    The pretty  and secluded nature of
{the steep sided wooded valley }make it
 undesirable  _ even if possible  _  to
 enlarge the car park and build tourist
 facilities. With the surrounding woods
 private,  very little room for picnics
 and no  food/drink available, visitors
 quickly drive away.{The site is spared
{a  busy commercial tourist atmosphere.
    {Facilities  relevant  to the Villa
{are excellent}_  lecture room, guides,
 introductory film, shop, Roman puzzle/
 quiz sheets for children and a museum.</content>
