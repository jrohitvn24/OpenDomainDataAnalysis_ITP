		<content> The standard of living is rising in   
 the community.Families spend a lot on 
 the care and improvement of their     
 homes and gardens.Most families have  
 television,children often having their
 own sets.People record and store      
 programmes for later playing.Young and
 old are fashion conscious,influenced  
 by television commercials.Articles    
 bought are of good quality.There is a 
 great choice of electrical goods,and  
 imported or out-of-season foodstuffs. 
 People are health conscious,dieting   
 and keeping fit by jogging or other   
 sports.On weekday evenings schools are
 used for social activities.People give
 time and cash to help charities.      
 Local police help teachers to educate 
 young people in road safety and foster
 good relations with authority.        
 Conservation of flora,fauna,buildings 
 and traditions is well supported.     </content>
