 There is a private school for girls in
 the grounds of Burton Park called     
 St. Michaels, occupying a large       
 country house which was originally the
 residence of the Courtauld family of  
 textile fame, and who left shortly    
 after the second world war. The school
 has built many new extensions to the  
 original property in recent years.
