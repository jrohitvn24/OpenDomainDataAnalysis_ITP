		<title>13A Day In My Holiday.</title>
		<content> A typical day  for me is to get up at 
 8.00 and at 8.30 have my breakfast. I 
 have a bowl of special K cereal a     
 piece of toast and a drink of orange. 
 After breakfast I go outside and sit  
 in the sun and read a book until Marie
 comes out. We have a little talk and  
 then we both go inside and ask if we  
 could play. Our mums say yes so we    
 come back out I go over to Marie's    
 house. We have another little talk and
 then we get the white tent out and we 
 pretend that we are living in it. Then
 at dinner time I go home and I have my
 dinner. After dinner we go swimming in
 Burnham pool until about 4.00pm. Then 
 we come back and have our tea. After  
 tea I go outside and see Marie and    
 then we play tennis over the fence    
 until 8.30 when I go inside and watch 
 television until I go to bed at 9.00. 
 Such is my home life.                 </content>
