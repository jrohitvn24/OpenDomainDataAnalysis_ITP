		<content> When the school closes for the summer 
 holiday the building does not remain  
 empty and unused.Groups may hire the  
 premises for various uses,one such    
 being the{Salvation Army Youth}who    
 come every year for a period of fun   
 and study in congenial surroundings.  
 For the last few years a local firm of
 fine art{auctioneers}has held a 3 day 
 auction of{antiques}at the school in  
 September.This benefits the auction_  
 eers,the sellers of the items and the 
 school.1985 had a particularly fine   
 lot of old{toys and dolls,}some of    
 which went for very high prices.      
 Other fund raising events at the      
 school include a summer fete,which has
 become very up to date by charging    
 parents and visitors to play games on 
 the{school computers.}Â£3000 was raised
 in 1984 much of this being spent on a 
 minibus for expeditions and outings.  </content>
