		<content>   Until three years ago, part of the  
 former war-time aerodrome at Croft was
 used as a car-racing and motor-cycling
 racing circuit. It was a well known   
 international motor-cycling circuit   
 which attracted riders from all over  
 thr world.                            
   Recently a small part of it has been
 developed for Rallycross, and the     
 remaining land is now used as farm    
 land.                                 
   Six Rallycross meetings are held    
 each year, when the average attendance
 is about a thousand spectators. At    
 major races, up to two thousand people
 attend, and these races are televised 
 occasionally.                         
   As Rallycrossing becomes more       
 established in this area, drivers from
 all over the country take part in the 
 events. They and their supporters     
 travel from all parts of the Britain. </content>
