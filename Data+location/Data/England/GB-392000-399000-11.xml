		<content> I like living in Ashton because there 
 are lots of interesting things to do. 
 The trouble is these things cost money
 and when you are 11 like me you don't 
 have much money. I get Â£1.50 spends a 
 week but from this I have to look     
 after my rabbit. It costs 20p for food
 which isn't too bad, but if I buy hay 
 it costs 70p and then I dont have much
 left. The baths cost 35p so I go most 
 weeks, but roller skating costs 95p so
 I don't go often. If it were cheaper  
 lots of children would go and I'm sure
 they would get more money because we  
 always buy drinks and crisps. When    
 the fair comes it's the same. They    
 charge high prices, as if adults are  
 paying. There should be lower prices  
 for children everywhere, or the       
 government should pass a law making   
 parents increase spends.
