		<title>19TRADITIONS FROM BALBY</title>
		<content> It is amazing what customs and        
 traditions a 9 year old can uncover   
 just by talking to the people around  
 the area. Having talked to many people
 Ihave discovered that:                
   It was traditional for Balby people 
 to take a weeks holiday in September  
 during what was called 'race week'.   
 Every man, woman and child went to    
 Doncaster Race Course to picnic, visit
 the fair and watch the races. The main
 race is the St. Leger. Many people    
 still carry on theis tradition.       
   In Balby on Sandford Rd. there is a 
 field called Tuby's Field where an    
 annual feast or fair was held. Mr.    
 Tuby was a fair ground owner and let  
 his field be used . There were stalls,
 games and amusements. It was held on a
 fine day in July but sadly the fair no
 longer meets here.
