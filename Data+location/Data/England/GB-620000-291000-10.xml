		<content> Small farms are between{50 and 150    
{acres.}The farm which I live on is 95 
 acres,but it is unlike other small    
 farms,spread about over quite a large 
 area.Our land has varying soil types  
 ranging from{medium loam to heavy     
{clay,}and so the crops vary           
 accordingly.                          
 The crops we grow are winter barley,  
 winter wheat, spring barley, and      
 grass.Occasionally we try other crops,
 but we usually stick to those         
 mentionned above.The winter wheat and 
 winter barley are sown in October and 
 the spring barley in April.All our    
 crops are harvested in the summer,the 
 winter wheat,winter barley and spring 
 barley are harvested in August and the
 hay is cut and made in June and July. 
 We do supplement our income by buying,
 fattening, and selling cattle through 
 the winter and we use their manure.   </content>
