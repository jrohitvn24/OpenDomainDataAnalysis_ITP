		<title>15MARWOOD N. SCHOOL PLAYTIMES</title>
		<content>     Our playground at school is not   
 one big one but three tarmaced areas  
 and two lawns.As there are only about 
 seventy-five children in the school,  
 we are allowed all sorts of equipment 
 from the P.E. shed at breaktime.      
     We play tennis,bat and ball       
 against the wall,mixed football and   
 netball. Children often skip and play 
 with the hoops.They also play tig and 
 imaginary games.                      
     We've got climbing frames on the  
 grass and parallel bars.The infants   
 have got a rope ladder,barrels and a  
 slide on the front lawn.Just this week
 Mr.Brooks our head teacher has put up 
 a death slide for us.                 
     We also have a computer to use    
 and comics to read during playtime.
