		<title>20RELIGIOUS BELIEFS IN HESSLE</title>
		<content> A survey was held in Hessle Church of 
 England Primary School amongst the    
 school children to find out how many  
 had religious beliefs. The school has 
 about 400 pupils at present and the   
 survey covered nearly all those       
 pupils.The results were as follows:   
   {62%} were Church of England        
   {16% }were "Don't Knows"            
   {10%} were Methodists               
    {5%} were Roman Catholics          
    {1%} were Jehovah's Witnesses      
    {1%} were Jewish                   
    {5%} were "Others".                
 The high percentage of "Don't Knows"  
 was made up of children who had not   
 attended a church in their life to    
 their knowledge.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
