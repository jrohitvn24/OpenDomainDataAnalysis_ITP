 large place.Others travel to          
 Knaresborough,Leeds and Bradford.     
{Most people get to work by car}because
 it is the quickest way.No one goes by 
 bus because there is no bus service   
 into Harrogate until 9.26 am and this 
 is too late for work as people start  
 between 8.am and 9.am and finish      
 between 5.pm and 6.pm .Most people    
 work Monday to Friday but some work at
