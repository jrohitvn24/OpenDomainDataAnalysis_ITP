		<title>13Fordham Woods, Fordham.</title>
		<content>   This wood is protected by the       
{Cambridgeshire and Ely Naturalist     
{Trust.}It is a wet-wood formed due to 
 a below water-level site. The wood is 
 being managed by volunteers to protect
 its special characteristics. Coppice  
 work is in progress to develop a shrub
 habitat and ditches are being dredged 
 to provide homes for frogs and dragon 
 flies. Certain species of trees are   
 encouraged like Alder and Willow whose
 rootsystems will resist wet condition 
 Other trees are discouraged like the  
 Sycamore which does not provide an    
 ideal habitat for insects and which   
 prevents the growth of other young    
 shrubs and trees. The wood provides a 
 home for roedeer, moorhens, and a     
 variety of insects. The special plant 
 species include Wild Hop and Water    
 Violets. Birds found include Black Cap
 and Chiffchaff.                       </content>
