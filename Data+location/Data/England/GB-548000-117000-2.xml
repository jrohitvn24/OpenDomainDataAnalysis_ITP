		<content> This area has developed a small       
 industrial estate due to the          
 availability of land. Industry has    
 expanded around a small business      
 initiated by a local family who own   
 all the surrounding land. This        
 ownership imposes limitations on      
 expansion of the estate. The trade    
 is primarily concerned with retail    
 distribution. This includes supplying 
 tiles, steel frames, land drains,     
 refrigerators and generators locally  
 and nationally. Some firms use        
 computer related technology to aid    
 communication and administration. The 
 workforce is small but employees      
 originate from all parts of Britain.  
 The general view from employees is    
 that life here hasn't changed since   
 the original Domesday Book, only      
 technology and working methods!
