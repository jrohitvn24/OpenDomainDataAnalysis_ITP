		<title>03FARMING IN COWICK.</title>
		<content>{Bull Farm}is a fruit farm selling     
 produce such as apples and            
 strawberries.The present 9 acre site  
 was part of a 200-300 acre farm       
 stretching across the hill towards Ide
 and across the valley towards the dual
 carriageway.The original farm was     
 purchased by the Water Authority as a 
 site for a new office complex,but they
 failed to get planning permission so  
 they sold off the land divided into   
 various smaller lots.The farmhouse is 
 built of stone, not cob,so it is      
 thought to be about 200 years old.The 
 present owner,Mr.Ward,hopes to buy    
 back some of the original land and    
 buildings.Customers are allowed to    
 pick their own fruit,and we found it  
 took about 30minutes to pick a tray of
 strawberries.
