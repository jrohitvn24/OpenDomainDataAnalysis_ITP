		<content> Today Tempsford is a small village in 
 the heart of Bedfordshire .A village  
 which many travellers on the A1 must  
 pass through without even knowing. Its
 glory lays in the past ,being a centre
 of many forms of transport.           
 The village has had to change with the
 times,no longer is the entire         
 population made up of local people. No
 longer are homes small and built from 
 only local materials.Village life no  
 longer revolves around the church and 
 the manor house.                      
 Tempsford has adapted well to changes 
 in particular the cruel disection  of 
 modern roads and for the most part it 
 is an unspoilt village,long may it    
 remain so.                            
                  The End.
