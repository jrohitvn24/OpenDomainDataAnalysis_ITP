		<title>05Farming _ Combine Harvester</title>
		<content>    On Friday the 10th of May some of  
 us went to survey land and in my group
 were Samantha, Emma, Kevin and        
 Edward.We had to interview a          
 farmer.After that we had a look at the
 combine harvester. It was a Massey    
 Ferguson.  When we had a good look    
 round we went in the control cab and  
 the farmer said he could teach our    
 teacher to drive it in about five     
 minutes.  I found out that my         
 grand_dad worked for the company that 
 sprayed his crops.  The combine's     
 colour was reddish brown and we heard 
 the engine start up.   We saw a rat   
 run across the yard.  The combine had 
 a big red cutter at the front and a   
 tube at the side.  When the tractor   
 comes along the tube is swung round   
 and the corn comes out and there is a 
 big tank in the middle which stores   
 the grain.                            </content>
