		<content> The woods in the Parks are of course  
 for conservation and recreational use.
 The roads and hills in the area are no
 obstacles for traffic. Going from the 
 south of our area towards the north we
 descend to the River Thames and before
 we reach the river we either pass     
 under or cross over the London to     
 Woolwich/Gravesend line, British Rail,
 Southern Region, so a great part of   
 the area is therefore flat.           
 The only part of our area covered by  
 water is the 2km of the River Thames. 
 There are small sections of derelict  
 land in the area but these will soon  
 be built on. Large buildings which    
 have been pulled down are now used as 
 temporary Car or Coach Parks or for   
 small housing estates. Most of the new
 buildings in the area are either      
 houses, maisonnettes or very low      
 blocks (4 floors) or flats.           </content>
