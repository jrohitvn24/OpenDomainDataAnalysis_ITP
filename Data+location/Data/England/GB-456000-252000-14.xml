		<title>14LOCAL HISTORY PRESTON CAPES</title>
		<content> The village of Preston Capes was once 
 known as Preston Magna and Little     
 Preston as Preston Parva.             
 This area was awarded to a French     
 Knight Hugh de Capes _ Hugues Capet _ 
 by William the Conquerer after l066.  
 He built a castle on the site of the  
 old Roman encampment which is now     
 occupied by the Manor House. There are
 still traces of the castle walls.     
 Latterly the area formed part of the  
 Fawsley Estate but has been gradually 
 sold off over the years.
