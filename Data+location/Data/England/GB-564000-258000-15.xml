		<title>15Stetchworth Area Shopping</title>
		<content> There is a Community shop in          
 Stetchworth, a Post Office and General
 Store in Woodditton, and as well as   
 the village shop just off the edge of 
 our block, a garage which sells small 
 food items in Saxon Street.           
  Most people do their main shopping in
 Newmarket or Cambridge, both of which 
 have new Shopping Centres. For special
 shopping such as for Christmas, people
 sometimes go to Peterborough. Some    
 people go to Bury St. Edmunds, where  
 there is a very good market. Newmarket
 and Cambridge also have markets.      
  Vans come round the area selling     
 things such as meat, bread, milk,     
 fruit and vegetables, fish, plants,   
 drinks and icecream. A laundry van,   
 Fish and Chip van and mobile library  
 also come.
