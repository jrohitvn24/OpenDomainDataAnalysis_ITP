 Iam Barrie Atkinson.                  
 I go to our school at quarter to      
 nine till half past three.When I get  
 back I have a drink and then I get    
 changed and go out to  play.I play    
 with Andrew Padget who  has his tea   
 with us. We play on  our bikes until  
 his mam comes to collect him and he   
 goes and has his supper. Then we go   
 out to play about on our bikes.My     
 favourite place to go is through the  
 beck when it is dry.We sometimes go to
 our den, which is a kind of hut.I     
 sometimes go with my Dad who is a     
 lorry driver. He usually delivers     
 plasterboard for British Gypsum.      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
