		<content>                                       
 The club was founded in the 1930's and
 named the Canon Frome Cricket Club by 
 the founder members. It plays on a    
 ground made available by a local      
 farmer which is tended by  members.   
 Players who started with the club as  
 young men, before moving away, travel 
 regularly from Hereford and even      
 Cardiff.The club has been in the first
 division of the Russel Baldwin and    
 Bright, Hereford and District cricket 
 league since it was founded and has   
 won the championship on three         
 occasions. In the Hereford Times this 
 week they are listed as playing the   
 Luctonians. The club runs two teams   
 and are keen to bring on young players
 but are concerned that few boys seem  
 to get a good grounding in the game in
 the secondary schools.
