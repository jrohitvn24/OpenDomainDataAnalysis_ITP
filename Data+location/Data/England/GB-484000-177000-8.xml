		<content>{Shottesbrook Farm.}The farm is 300    
 years old.It was probably split up    
 into 5 farms each with several men    
 keeping pigs, sheep and cattle. In    
 1944 the first tractor was bought and 
 in 1950 a combine harvester.All the   
 cows were sold in 1963 and just beef  
 cattle were kept.The farm house was   
 built in 1600 and added to in 1700 and
 1800.Drains were dug into the fields  
 in the late 1930's and main water     
 pipes were installed across the       
 farm(Hurley to Bracknell) in 1966.At  
 the present time Shottesbrook is a    
 combination of five farms all farmed  
 under the same name.There are 4 barns 
 which are used for machinery          
 storage.The farm extends to 1500      
 acres.Wheat,barley,rape and peas are  
 grown.Workers are able to contact each
 other by using radio.
