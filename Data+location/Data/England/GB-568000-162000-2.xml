		<title>02Upper Halling by Warren</title>
		<content>   There are just over one hundred     
 houses in the small village of Upper  
 Halling.It looks as if it is going to 
 get bigger as they are now building   
 twenty new houses where once the      
 village chapel stood.                 
                                       
   Next to the new houses is the very  
 popular Jubilee Hall,which is used for
 such things as a clinic for           
 babies,Church,Playgroups,Parish       
 Meetings and bingo.It is hired out    
 most weekends for dances and wedding  
 receptions.                           
                                       
   In Upper Halling there is a boat    
 shop and a woodyard.The two pubs are  
 "The Black Boy"and "The Robin Hood."  
 There are several very old buildings  
 which are lived in as houses or       
 farmhouses.                           
                                       </content>
