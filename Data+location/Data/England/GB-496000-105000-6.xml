		<title>06Walberton_New Village Hall</title>
		<content>   The subject uppermost in village    
 life this year is the provision of a  
 new village hall to replace the last  
 one, condemned and demolished because 
 of dry rot.                           
   It was decided at a general meeting 
 two years ago to raise funds to       
 build another hall designed to meet   
 the needs of the village.  The likely 
 total cost is expected to be about    
 Â£140,000, a large part of which should
 be available through grants.  Progress
 to date is that a design is soon to be
 selected, a site on the playing field 
 has been chosen, and over Â£23,000 has 
 been raised.  About Â£40,000 is needed 
 for work to commence. Fund raising has
 included two fetes with Donkey Derbys,
 coffee mornings, concerts, Harvest    
 suppers, various sales, 7 sponsored   
 marathon runners, donations, dogshow, 
 etc.                                  </content>
