		<content>    Has anything else changed about    
 Masham? "They tarmaced the market     
 square that was all cobbles and       
 gravel.There used to be a fair at     
 Masham.They had it on one side of the 
 market square one year and on the     
 other the next."He was asked if he    
 thought there was anything wrong with 
 Masham."Not really _ just to many     
 'outsiders." He used to go to the     
 pictures twice a week to see Magic    
 Lantern shows and silent movies and he
 liked playing down on the 'rec' best. 
 It used to be nothing but wild rhubarb
 near the pavilion.Did he ever go and  
 play in the river? "Oh yes! We've even
 sledged and ice skated on it when it  
 was frozen over in the Winter.It used 
 to creak a bit when we were on it.We  
 weren't really scared but then you    
 don't really think when you are       
 young."                               </content>
