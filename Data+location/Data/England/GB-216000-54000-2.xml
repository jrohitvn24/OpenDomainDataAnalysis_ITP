		<title>02THE CORNISH HEDGE</title>
		<content> We looked at a section of a typically 
{Cornish hedge}an earth bank with small
 trees on top.The hedge faces west and 
 measured about 20 metres.We made a    
 diary of flowers found in the hedge   
 over a period of eight weeks,beginning
 8th May.The hedge has not been cut    
 since last Autumn.After six weeks of  
 looking at our hedge we have found    
 twenty-nine different flowers.(Two    
 weeks later it was thirty-two).Some   
 flowers have been in the hedge every  
 week,some for only a short time.Blue  
 bells were in the hedge for only two  
 weeks.At first most of the flowers    
 were yellow;now they are              
 yellow,red,white,blue and some are    
 even green,like sorrel and wall       
 penny-wort.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
