		<content> This year the crops were              
 wheat,barley,peas,sugar beet,oil seed 
 rape and grassland for grazing and    
 hay.Their daughter rears horses.      
 In 1948 there were 10 people employed 
 on the farm. In 1985 there are 6. In  
 1939 horses were used for ploughing.  
 Today this farm has 5 tractors,1 fork 
 lift,1 combine harvester and 1 lorry. 
 Up to 1979 there were 120 ewes which  
 had 200 lambs.Today there are no      
 sheep.Oil seed rape is the only crop  
 which has recently been added to the  
 crops previously grown.               
 When the farmer's wife first lived in 
 the house she had to clean oil lamps  
 and cook on a fire. The family love   
 living on the farm.They have a        
 two-week holiday abroad every two or  
 three years.They have three cats and  
 one collie dog.
