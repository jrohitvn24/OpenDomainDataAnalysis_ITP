 affair with a Priest who lived in     
 Popes Tower.  When the affair was     
 discovered he was sacked and she was  
 mortified, and committed suicide in

 In 196O photographs were being taken  
 of the Manor for Country Life magazine
 and when the photographs were         
 developed the photographer asked Lord 
 Harcourt 'Who is the lady in the      
 photograph, I cannot remember her     
 being there when I took the           
 photograph?'  It was, of course, Alice
 and the photograph is in the          
 possession of Lord Harcourt's daughter
 who now lives at the Manor House.     </content>
