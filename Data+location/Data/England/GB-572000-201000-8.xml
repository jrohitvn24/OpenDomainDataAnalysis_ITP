		<title>08SOUTHLANDS FARM (CONT)</title>
		<content>   The busiest time of the year is     
 Autumn, because the ground has to be  
 prepared for the seeds to be planted. 
 On their farm, there is no daily      
 routine, but they get up around 6.45  
 a.m.                                  
   The straw which is left over from   
 the corn when it has been harvested is
 baled and stored to put on to a       
 conveyor belt and a machine grinds it,
 a pipe transfers it into a boiler. The
 boiler has a furnace inside and it    
 burns the straw, instead of it being  
 burnt in the fields. This also heats  
 the farmhouse.                        
   They have two scarecrows, and they  
 employ two bird scarers to shoot the  
 pigeons, to stop them from eating the 
 seeds.                                
   They also keep a special corner for 
 wildlife and they are careful about   
 cutting their hedges.                 </content>
