		<title>01The Dymock Area</title>
		<content>  Our block covers a country area to   
 the north of the village of Dymock.   
 The River Leadon flows through the    
 block and the M.50 crosses the south  
 western corner. Most of the land is   
 farmed, with dairy farming the main   
 activity. The scenery is very pleasant
 with views of May Hill, Marcle Hill   
 and the Malvern Hills. There are some 
 orchards and a large wood. Most of the
 people live in the village of Dymock. 
  The motorway brings lots of tourists,
 especially in spring to see the wild  
 daffodils. The motorway also makes it 
 possible for people to live in Dymock 
 and work in Birmingham although it is 
 50 miles away.                        
  The nearest small towns are Ledbury  
 and Newent, each about 4 miles away.  
 It is about 15 miles to Gloucester.
