		<content>     Burton Station is on the main line
from the north-east to the south-west. 
Now only a small island platform,      
northbound trains carry many commuters 
to Derby, whereas southbound trains    
call at Burton en route to Birmingham. 
     The East Staffordshire District   
Council operates a network of bus      
services in and around the town.       
Apart from several vehicles bedecked in
advertisements for local firms, the    
buses are maroon and cream.   At this  
time one of the larger independent     
operators, Stevenson's, based at       
Uttoxeter, and operating into the town 
mainly from the north of the county, is
merging with the local authority.   For
the time being, though, the distinctive
yellow and black livery will remain a  
distinctive and popular feature of the 
town's streets.
