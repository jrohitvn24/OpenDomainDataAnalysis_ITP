		<title>01RIPLEY (East) and CODNOR</title>
		<content>   This area covers the eastern half   
 of Ripley including Peasehill and     
 Waingroves, and the village of Codnor 
 including Cross Hill.Both places were 
 mentioned in the original Domesday    
 book.Ripley's market and fair have    
 medieval origins, and the DeGrey      
 family built a castle at Codnor. Its  
 ruins still stand today.              
   Both places developed in the 19th   
 century resulting from coal mining in 
 the area. The pits have all closed    
 now, but parts of the area are still  
 being mined by open cast.New industry 
 has been attracted into the area by   
 the creation of industrial estates.   
   Ripley has a Town Council and Codnor
 a Parish Council. Both come under the 
 Amber Valley District Council and     
 Derbyshire County Council which are   
 Labour controlled. The MP for Amber   
 Valley is Conservative.          {MB  </content>
