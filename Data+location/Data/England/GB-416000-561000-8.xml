		<title>08WINLATON'S GHOSTS &amp; WITCHES</title>
		<content> The ghost is said to appear on the    
 site of a flour mill on the River     
 Derwent.Anne a pretty twenty five year
 old was housekeeper to her uncle John 
 Walker, the mill owner. She           
 disappeared without trace. Her spirit 
 gave the miller the circumstances of  
 her death. She had been murdered with 
 a pick making five wounds in her      
 head.Afterwards she was thrown into a 
 pit. Her murderers Sharp and Walker   
 were also named. The body was found   
 where the ghost had stated. The       
 evidence appears to have been         
 convincing as Sharp and Walker were   
 executed in 1631.                     
 Hagg's Hill is reputed to have        
 sinister connections with a coven of  
 witches.However, this legend may be   
 based on the misunderstood meaning of 
 Hagg which means "boggy" ground.
