		<title>17Worth: General survey.</title>
		<content>   Worth, a village just South of      
Sandwich, has a population of 748      
people over 18. It has a shop, a school
2 pubs, a Parish Hall, and a pond.     
   The shop is a general store and P.O.
The church is 11th century, has a lych-
gate and choir, and shares a vicar with
Staple and Woodnesborough churches.    
The school is Worth County Primary     
School and has a total of 46 pupils,   
and two full time teachers. It has a   
small swimming pool. This Easter       
holiday the parents and teachers re-   
decorated the interior of the school.  
   The two pubs are called 'The Blue   
Pigeons' and 'The Crispin'.            
   The Parish Hall used to belong to   
the church. Now the Parish of Worth    
owns it and all the villagers can use  
it. In the last few months some of the 
villagers have lowered the hall ceiling
rewired it and decorated it.           </content>
