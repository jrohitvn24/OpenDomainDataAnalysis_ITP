		<title>04MY DAYS AS ROSE QUEEN</title>
		<content>I was elected as the 1985 Rose Queen; I
had beaten Lorraine Tatman by only two 
points and she and Elizabeth Short were
my two attendants. In the morning I was
very excited. Mum got my sister ready  
and then I got ready. When I was ready 
Mum took some photos of us in the      
garden and then Dad helped me into the 
car and we went down to the farm next  
to our school. We went up to the gate  
and I did not recognise Lorraine and   
Elizabeth, all in pink. We were very   
nervous but excited. We went to to the 
front of the carnival. A man from the  
paper interviewed us and took some     
photos and then the carnival started.  
After the carnival I gave my speech and
I was welcomed by Viscount Althorp with
a kiss. Then I went round to talk to   
the children and and the old people.   
{I really enjoyed my days as Rose      
Queen.}                                </content>
