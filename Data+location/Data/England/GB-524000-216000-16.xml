		<content>{ARTISTS AND WRITERS}                  
 In 1983 the Datchworth Art Group was  
 formed. It meets regularly and runs an
 annual art and craft fair which has   
 included work for sale by local       
 amateur artists. One professional     
 artist lives in the village and he    
 also teaches Art to adults at         
 Stevenage College of Further          
 Education. There are three resident   
 professional writers, one of whom is a
 writer of children's fiction.         
{CRAFTS}                               
 Living in the village is man who makes
 ornamental cane seating and a lady who
 designs stained glass windows.        
{MUSIC}                                
 Occasionally recitals, performed by   
 local amateur musicians, are held in  
 All Saints Church.
