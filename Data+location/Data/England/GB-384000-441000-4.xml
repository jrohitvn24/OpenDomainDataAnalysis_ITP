		<title>04A DAY AT BLACKO SCHOOL   (1)</title>
		<content> Tracey stepped through the door of    
 Blacko School just as the bell rang.  
 She was later than she wanted to be   
 because she wanted to finish off a    
 poster she was colouring. Mr. Wright, 
 the school's headmaster came through  
 to call everyone into assembly.       
 Alexandra took her place on the piano 
 stool and Kathryn sat on a chair      
 beside her. Since Mrs. Leese had      
 retired these two girls had been      
 playing the piano and flute in        
 assembly. Mr. Wright talked about the 
 usual things. He picked up an egg and 
 teased the infants, pretending it     
 could speak. Then all the children    
 sang 'Morning has broken'. "Hands     
 together, eyes closed," commanded Mr. 
 Wright, so everyone got ready to say  
 their prayers. Assembly finished and  
 the children went back to their       
 classrooms to begin a day's work.     </content>
