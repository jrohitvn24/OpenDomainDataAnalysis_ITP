		<title>07    THE AMBULANCE MAN</title>
		<content> I woke early to go to work.I put on my
 dark blue uniform and had breakfast.My
 shift this week is 8:00am to 2:00pm I 
 like my work because I like helping   
 people.Soon after I arrived at work   
 the telephone rang.It was someone     
 ringing to say her daughter had fallen
 downstairs.I am driver today so my    
 partner rode in the cabin.I switched  
 on the siren and blue flashing lamp on
 the top we went quickly back carefully
 through the traffic.At he house we    
 found the girl had broken her arm.I   
 put on an inflatable splint and took  
 her to the ambulance in the special   
 carrying chair.Her mother came too.My 
 partner gave her a little epinox gas  
 as her arm hurt her.We took her to the
 casualty unit at Ascot where her arm  
 would be treated then back to the     
 station.When we got back the other van
 had gone to get some old people.      </content>
