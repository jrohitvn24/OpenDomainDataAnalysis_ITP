		<content>   Attercliffe and Darnall are east of 
{Sheffield}city centre in the Don      
 Valley, once the hub of a large steel 
 making{industry.}The decline of steel 
 production in recent years has lead to
 problems of redundancy and            
 dereliction.                          
   Years ago the area would have been  
 full of smoke and grime belching from 
 the works, but now the air is clean.  
 Smaller industries have survived and  
 new small, eficient firms are moving  
 into the area.                        
   A large percentage of the population
 are Asian{imigrants}who have moved    
 into those terraced houses which have 
 survived the slum clearance programme.
 A number of{gypsy families}live in the
 area- dealing in scrap metal- some on 
 an official site but others in the    
 waste-lands created by the bulldozers.
