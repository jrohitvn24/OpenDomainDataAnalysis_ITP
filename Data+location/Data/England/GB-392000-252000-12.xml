		<content> St. John's, White Ladies Aston is     
 mainly Norman with solid Tudor timbers
 supporting the bell tower. At this    
 time the community is in the midst of 
 raising a fnd of Â£12,000 to repair the
 tower. The list of vicars dates back  
 to 1301.                              
 St. Michael &amp; All Angels, Churchill,  
 is a small church which is mentioned  
 in the 1st. Domesday Book. At present 
 it is a source of anxiety as it is    
 very damp and in rather a bad state of
 repair.                               
 These two churchs are joined to the   
 neighbouring parish of Peopleton where
 their vicar lives.                    
 There was formerly a non - conformist 
 Chapel in Upton Snodsbury, but it fell
 into disuse, and converted into a     
 private house some years ago.
