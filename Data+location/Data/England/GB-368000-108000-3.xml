		<title>03Old &amp; New Houses in Holwell</title>
		<content> A 200 year old cottage stands beside  
 a new detached house. The former has  
 one cold water tap, outdoor lavatory, 
 electric light, and no bath. It is    
 heated by an open fire.{The house}has 
 three lavatories, bath, shower and    
 numerous power points, used for auto- 
 matic washing machine, dishwasher,    
 tumble drier, refrigerator, freezer,  
 toaster, iron, food-mixer, microwave  
 oven, television and radio. Constant  
 hot water and central heating is by an
 oil fired boiler in addition to an    
 open fireplace. The house also has    
 double garage and electric meter on   
 outside wall. It is built with modern 
 materials for easy maintenance.       
{The cottage}has no damp course and    
 old uneven walls. Both homes meet the 
 needs of their occupants.             
 Will the house withstand time as well 
 as the cottage has done?              </content>
