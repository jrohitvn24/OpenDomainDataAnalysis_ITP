		<title>15Interview - Reen Manor Farm</title>
		<content> The old farm at Reen is one of tho    
 oldest settlements in the Perranporth 
 area.The present day owner is Mr.     
 Opie.The children of our class went to
 interview him.They asked him many     
 questions.It appears that the farm has
 gone through great changes recently.  
 Last year the European Parliament     
 announced measures to cut back in the 
 over production of milk and dairy     
 products within the community.Our     
 government gave dairy farmers quotas  
 so that surplus milk would not have to
 be subsidised.Farmers had no option   
 but to reduce their herds and a lot   
 have had to go out of business.Mr.    
 Opie sold off his herd and converted  
 his farm into holiday chalets.He      
 does,however,keep some horses and a   
 few hens.He also sells hay.He is      
 philosophical and says he still has   
 the "Stone and the land!"             </content>
