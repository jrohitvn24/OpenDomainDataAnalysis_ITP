 ......because people still thought    
 Jane was a witch.They started off with
 five bells in the church,but now they 
 have six bells.On the walls outside   
 the church there are grooves where    
 people sharpened their arrows to      
 practice shooting incase the Vikings  
 and the Danes attacked.There were     
 seven Earl Cowpers.They owned much of 
 Hertford,Tewin and Digswell.They lived
 in Panshanger house.In the churchyard 
 four of the seven Earls are buried in 
 a family,two others were nearby and   
 the seventh was buried in the         
 church.Earl Cowper gave a donation for
 our school to be built for the village
 children.The first Rector in the      
 church dates from about 1239,so the   
 church was probably built sometime in 
 the thirteenth century.In 1890 the    
 church was starting to crumble away.>></content>
