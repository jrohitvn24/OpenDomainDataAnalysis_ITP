Charing C of E School is one hundred   
and eleven years old. Over these past  
years Charing School has changed a     
great deal.                            
   Charing School was first opened on  
the 13th January 1873 by John Grainger 
Williams, who undertook charge of the  
schools for a term, until a permanent  
appointment was made. Charing School   
used to be a seperate boys and girls   
school until 1877 when it became a     
mixed school as it is today.           
   Today there are one hundred and     
forty seven pupils attending this      
school in six classrooms with seven    
teachers. Over the years the building  
has been added to, but now parts of the
school aren't in use any more. During  
1977 the school role reached its peak  
with about two hundred and seventy     
children on the role.                  </content>
