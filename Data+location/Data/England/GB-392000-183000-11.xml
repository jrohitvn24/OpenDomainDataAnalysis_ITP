		<title>11Fishing Trout River Avon</title>
		<content> Mr Benstead is the{River Keeper}for 10
 miles of trout water managed by the   
{Somerford Fishing Association (S.F.A.)
 formed in 1883. He plants weeds       
 which encourage insect life for trout.
 He cleans the river of rubbish,surplus
 weed, fallen trees and he controls    
 vermin especially wild mink.He stocks 
 the river with trout every 3 to 4     
 weeks in the trout season.He supplies 
 3,000 trout each year.Fly fishing only
 is around{Kingsmead Mill}and a stretch
 near{Angrove Wood}but bait or fly is  
 near Great Somerford.Members of the   
{S.F.A.}mostly come from the{Bristol   
 area.The worst problem is pollution   
 from sprays and industrial waste and  
 pike which eat their own weight in    
 fish in a week.They elecrify the water
 to stun pike and chub and take them to
  coarse fishing water.Pollution killed
 Grayling.It will take 10yr to replace.</content>
