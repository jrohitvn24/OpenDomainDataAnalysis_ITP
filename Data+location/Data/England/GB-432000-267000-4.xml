{Cubbington}is quite an old village. It
 has just eight shops which include two
 groceries, a post office, an off      
 license, a fish &amp; chip shop, a        
 butcher, a chemist and hairdressers   
 On the way to the shops there is a    
 church called St Marys.It is nice.I   
 often go there with the guides. The   
 guides is held in a village hall. I   
 live in a new building site called    
 Pinehurst. Pinehurst is just up from a
 sawmill. There are two sawmills in    
 Cubbington The main wood the sawmill  
 has is pine but they also  have oak,  
 ash and deciduous. There is a lot of  
 land in Cubbington. Most of it is     
 crops, there is some land for cattle. 
 We have a restaurant called The Rugby 
 Tavern which is on the Rugby Road.The 
 Rugby Road joins up  with Cubbington  
 Road which leads to Lillington.       </content>
