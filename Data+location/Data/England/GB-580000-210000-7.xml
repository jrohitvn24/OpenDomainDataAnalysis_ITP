		<content> Much of the area is devoted to        
 orchards. The main produce is apples  
 and pears with some soft fruit.       
 Fontenay Orchards cover 62 acres in   
 all. It is part of a larger           
 co-operative enterprise, based in     
 Kent. Two men work full-time and two  
 women part-time. There is some        
 P.Y.O.(pick your own), but the annual 
 produce of more than 500 tons is sold 
 nationwide, and to the near continent.
 Whitehouse Farm covers 55 acres,      
 including woodland of oak, with       
 recently planted conifers to provide  
 cover for a local shoot. All produce  
 is for the retail trade. Two men work 
 full-time, and up to 30 work casually 
 in the summer. The farm has its own   
 reservoir, which provides ample water.
 Varieties of fruit include cox,       
 discovery, spartan, egremont russet,  
 and bramley apples and some pears.    </content>
