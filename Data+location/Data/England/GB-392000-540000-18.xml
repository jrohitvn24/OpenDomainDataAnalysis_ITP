       There are quite a few clubs in  
 Rookhope; one of them is a Youth Club 
 where children go to play pool,       
 snooker, darts and table tennis.......
 you can also buy sweets and listen to 
 records.                              
       Another club is the Working     
 Men's Club and there is a Badminton   
 Club as well.                         
       The Workmen's Club is for the   
 grown-ups to go to at night but the   
 children can go if they want any      
 crisps or appletise.                  
       The Badminton Club is where     
 children play badminton; you get a    
 drink of orange for five pence. It is 
 good because you learn how to play.
