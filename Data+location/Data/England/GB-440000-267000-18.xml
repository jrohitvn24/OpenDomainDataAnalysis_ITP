		<content> We did a survey of houses in the      
 villages of Marton and Birdingbury    
 counting the number of houses in the  
 following categories,semi_detached,   
 terraced houses,mobile homes &amp;        
 bungalows.It was most noticeable in   
 both villages that the majority of    
 people owned and lived in detached    
 properties valued between Â£45,000.and 
 Â£100,000.There were only 6 thatched   
 cottages remaining in Marton village; 
 much of the thatch having been        
 replaced by tiles in the last few     
 years.The survey revealed there are   
 roughly the same numbers of bungalows,
 semi-detached and terraced homes,but  
 the price of properties in these      
 villages make it very difficult for   
 younger families to purchase their own
 homes.Many people had extended or     
 improved their homes within the last  
 five years.                           </content>
