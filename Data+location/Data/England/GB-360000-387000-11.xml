		<title>11WARRINGTON NEW TOWN</title>
		<content>{Warrington Borough and New Town       
     In 1847 the town was granted the  
 status of a municipal corporation.    
 Ambitious plans were laid for the     
 renewal of the town centre, the Town  
 Hall becoming the administrative      
 centre for the Borough. Plans were    
 also made when Warrington was         
 designated a New Town on 26 April     
 1968, the headquarters being New Town 
 House. The designated area of the New 
 Town is 18,612 acres, and it is one of
 three 'partnership' New Towns in the  
 country.                              
    The local authorities, Warrington  
 Borough Council and Cheshire County   
 Council, retain their responsibilities
 for statutory services and            
 consultation takes place amongst all  
 three bodies. Eventually the Borough  
 Council will have to decide whether to
 assume responsibility for the area.   </content>
