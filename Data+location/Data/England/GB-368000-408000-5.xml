		<title>05MY MUM,MAYORESS,BOLTON 84-85</title>
		<content>   I was very excited when I heard that
 my mother was going to be Mayoress and
 my grandmother was to be Mr.Mayor.Half
 of the year my mother was mayoress and
 the other half my aunt was.I got many 
 unusual trips in the Mayoral car which
 is a Daimler Jaguar.It is very        
 comfortable and quiet.On one of our   
 journeys we went to Bolton Fire       
 Station and it was very interesting.  
   Life changed a lot at school and    
 whenever I mentioned the words Mayor  
 or Mayoress I was said to be boasting 
 or showing off.Eventually I got used  
 to it.Sometimes it was quite useful   
 because occasionally I got time off   
 school.The first time this happened I 
 had to go to see my grandmother in the
 Council Chamber.She sometimes got very
 firm and often shouted at the other   
 councillors arguing.
