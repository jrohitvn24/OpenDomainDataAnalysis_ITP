		<title>19Balloon crashes in Graveyard</title>
		<content>    "9/7/85 -There was a hot air       
 balloon hovering in the sky.It was    
 blue and white. It had a large advert 
 for Alka Seltzer on the side.Helen,   
 Karen,Sarah and I were in the wood in 
 our camp.We also had Karen's baby     
 sister Emma with us in her push chair.
    The balloon was flying very low and
 as I looked up I could see a little   
 flame trying to keep the balloon up.  
 I could see the faces of two men      
 looking down from the basket at us.   
    Finally the balloon had to land    
 near the {"Elephants' Graveyard"}(A   
 local name for a mound of stones from 
 a disused quarry).                    
   Lots of people ran through the corn 
 field to see the balloon. The farmer  
 wasn't very pleased - he let out his  
 dogs and we ran back to the woods."
