It is very obrious that this area is   
undergoing considerable change in the  
mid 1980's. Small, compact, terrace    
housing estates,wharehouses some       
derelict, industries such as timber,   
metallurgy all servs as reminders of   
the recent past when the area was part 
of the great port of london. Here were 
situated the West India and Millwall   
docks receiving cargo boats which had s
travelled up the river Thames from the 
open sea.All the docks are now closed  
and the subject of a great deal of land
reclamation.It is an area designated as
an "enterprise zone" encouraging new   
businenes and develoment. High         
technology industry office development.
A hypermarket luxury flats are  now    
all part of the changing  face of the  
Isle of  Dogs.
