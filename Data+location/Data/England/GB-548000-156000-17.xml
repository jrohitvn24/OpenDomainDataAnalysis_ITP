 For families with oldest child 15- at 
 least one of the weekend days was     
 arranged for the family to be together
 but most children eat an evening meal 
 looking at television or not with     
 their parents. Convenience foods are  
 mainly eaten at these meals.          
 Sevenoaks is used as a local centre   
 for young people:the main forms of    
 entertainment there include : cinema, 
 amateur theatre,disco evenings, a new 
 swimming pool, community centre.      
 Teenage parties arranged by groups are
 common - the difficulties with

 this area as in some parts.
