		<title>19ASHTON MILL 1</title>
		<content>     Ashton Mill is located on the main
 road from Oundle to Polebrook. It lies
 outside the village of Ashton on the  
 River Nene. It is on lower land than  
 the rest of the village.              
     In the original Domesday Book     
 there is the following entry :-       
{   "In Ashton 4 1/2 hides. Land for   
{    8 ploughs. In lordship 2 ploughs, 
{    with 1 slave; 11 villagers and 2  
{    smallholders with 6 ploughs.      
{    2 mills at 4Os and 325 eels;      
{    meadow, 16 acres; woodland, 4     
{    acres. The value was 1s; now Â£7." 
 We do not think that there is any     
 physical evidence of the original     
 mills but we think it is likely that  
 they were near the present site which 
 is 'just down the hill from the       
 church'.                              
                                       
                                       </content>
