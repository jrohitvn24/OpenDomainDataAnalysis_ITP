 I get up about 8 o'clock and get      
 dressed. When I've had my breakfast   
 I check that I've got everything in my
 school bag and then watch TVAM. At a  
 quarter to 9 I leave for school. In   
 the morning we do Maths and Language  
 and then we have dinner. After that we
 go in and work.                       
 When I get home I have a cup of tea   
 with Mum. The I go out and do the     
 animals at Stidston (a 7 acre field   
 with 2 barns that we keep lots of     
 animals in). After we've done that we 
 fill the water buckets. Then we go    
 home and have tea and I watch tele    
 until bed time. Then I get into bed   
 and read until I can't keep my eyes   
 open any more.
