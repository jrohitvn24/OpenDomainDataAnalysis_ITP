		<title>03CLOPTONS CHURCHES</title>
		<content> There are 3 churches situated locally;
 St Mary the Virgin, Otley, St Mary's  
 Clopton and St Botolph's Burgh. The   
 vicar of St Mary's Clopton is also the
 vicar of St Mary the Virgin, Otley and
 alternates his time between the 2     
 churches. He also takes a family      
 service at Swilland and Ashbocking    
 Church once a month.                  
 All 3 churches are of the Church of   
 England denomination. They each have a
 churchyard which is very well kept.
