		<title>15THE ELM TREE</title>
		<content> Latchingdon School planted an elm tree
 in 1982 on Tuesday May 25th. Our elm  
 tree was planted because most of the  
 elm trees have been killed off by     
 Dutch Elm Disease so we planted it in 
 the hope that it would not die because
 it was a special American type.In the 
 first year it's height was 1m 90cm.In 
 the second year it was 2m 37\cm and   
 now it's height is 2m 35cm!Somehow it 
 has shrunk!In the beginning of the    
 second year of our elm tree some      
 rabbits had been chewing the bottom of
 the tree,so there is some wire netting
 round the bottom of the tree now.There
 are 23 other trees around our school. 
 They are mainly small trees but there 
 is one big tree inside and one big    
 tree just outside the school.The big  
 trees are Yew trees and the others are
 all different types.
