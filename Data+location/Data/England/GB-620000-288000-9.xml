		<content> A number of people in the area support
 conservation actively.1 farmer hopes  
 to re-establish hedges round all his  
 fields achieving this by planting     
 young trees both deciduous &amp; evergreen
 &amp; also by retaining selfgrown saplings
 The trees are planted in hedges,clumps
 in corners of fields or in a small    
 wood;they are hand weeded,watered &amp;   
 protected,records are kept &amp; photos   
 taken.Other farmers &amp; landowners have 
 also planted trees or grown them for  
 seed,improved derelict areas  making  
 them more attractive to wildlife;1 has
 a thriving colony of Rudd in his moat 
 &amp; has also introduced Carp.On 1 farm  
 pheasants,French &amp; English Partridges 
 are reared,100 pheasants are released 
 annually.There are a number of marked 
 footpaths,some farmers are willing to 
 reopen unused paths except where      
 grazing animals would be disturbed.   </content>
