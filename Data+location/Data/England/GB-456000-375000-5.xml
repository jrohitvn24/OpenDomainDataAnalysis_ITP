		<title>05Worksop College Buildings</title>
		<content>     Just before 1890, the Duke of     
 Newcastle studied at Ellsmere College 
 and finally at Denstone College.      
 Both of these colleges were run by the
 Woodard Corporation and the Duke was  
 so impressed with the two that he had 
 been to,that he decided to give them  
 90 acres to build another one just to 
 the South of Worksop.He built the     
 drive to the college grounds and lined
 it with cedar trees whilst Aston Webb 
 constructed the college buildings.    
   The construction of the college     
 began in 1890 and it was opened in    
 1893. Many smaller buildings have been
 built since including buildings for   
 the staff,a Music and Arts school,    
 Boarding house,swimming pool and      
 another gymnasium. This was built in  
 order to replace the original         
 gymnasium which was destroyed by fire 
 in 1942.                              </content>
