		<content>   St.Peter's, Church Langton, is a    
 limestone and sandstone church. The   
 lower part of the building dates from 
 the late 13th century;the tower,naves 
 and tall windows are 15th century;the 
 roofing is Victorian. There are 8     
 bells in the tower. The oldest grave  
 is dated 1695. The Hanbury's family   
 grave has a carving of an angel. Some 
 of Hanbury's trees are still growing  
 in the Rectory garden. The Rectory and
 Churchyard were used in a recent T.V. 
 dramatisation of C.P.Snow's "Strangers
 and Brothers". The church is a cross  
 shape. Most of the windows are stained
 glass, telling Bible stories. The     
 church furniture is wooden with       
 decorative carvings.  The oldest tomb,
 that of Richard Roberts,a knight,is   
 dated 1644. In the late 17th century  
 Roundheads chopped the fingers, nose  
 and toes off the statue on the tomb.  </content>
