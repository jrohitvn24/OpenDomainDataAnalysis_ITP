<content>The rural area within "our square" is unlikely to change in the fore-seeable future.There are no motorways in Dorset and no planned major road improvements in this area. The large Shaftesbury and Crichel Estates form a large part of this countryside.&lt;br />&lt;br />However, with the Olympics scheduled for 2012 and sailing events to be held in Weymouth and Portland there are Dorset roads being up-graded and a completely new road from Dorchester to Weymouth has been constructed. As "our square" is so far away, most traffic will not affect this part of East Dorset, only a few of other minor roads may be used.&lt;br />&lt;br />Certainly, many more people are aware of the part they can play in conserving our wildlife.This area is in part of the designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty - (AONB) - Cranborne Chase and West Wiltshire Downs. Additionally, many more buzzards are seen as their food sources seem more reliable and deer roam freely.   &lt;br />
