		<content> Stevensons was founded by the         
 Stevenson family, originally as a     
 laundry and then turned to dyeing     
 articles for people. It is now no     
 longer a family firm, but part of the 
 Nottingham manufacturing group, a     
 major supplier of sock, hosiery and   
 knitwear for chain stores. They dye   
 socks, stockings and garments in all  
 types of material such as Wool,       
 Cotton, Nylon, polyester as well as   
 silk. They also dye yarn for carpets  
 and all forms of knitwear.            
 1150 people are employed.             
 It is 24 hour service.                
 Approx 1,5000,020 gallons of water are
 used a day for dyeing articles. They  
 dye materials and export all over the 
 world including India, China and      
 Japan.
