		<content> We use combine harvesters to harvest  
 our wheat, barley, oats and rape. We  
 use tractors to plough  the land and  
 potato harvesters to lift the potatoes
 although some farms still only turn   
 them onto the soil whereas the new    
 machines will riddle and pack them.   
 The straw from the corn harvest is    
 baled for use in the winter months.   
 Many of the farmers in this area have 
 both livestock and crops although two 
 out of three farmers in Marton le     
 Moor only own arable land. The farmers
 who own livestock mostly have cows and
 or sheep, not many pigs are bred in   
 this area. Most of the cows are bred  
 for meat or to be sold at market. One 
 farmer breeds pedigree Charolais and  
 has won several prizes including      
 Supreme Champion at the Royal         
 Agricultural Show in 1982.
