 filmed working at home.She said "I    
 don't mind my Mum teaching me. The    
 work is easier than at school".       
   Following a Protest March along the 
 A5 a meeting was held in the school   
 attended by members of the Education  
 Committee,local                       
 councillors,governors,the Headmaster  
 and parents and the whole matter was  
 discussed very thoroughly.            
 Following County Council Election's   
 on Thursday, May 2nd,the new Education
 Committee  agreed to the bus being    
 re-instated with the proviso that this
 could be a temporary measure pending a
 review of the Council's transport     
 policy. The children returned  to     
 school on June 24th.
