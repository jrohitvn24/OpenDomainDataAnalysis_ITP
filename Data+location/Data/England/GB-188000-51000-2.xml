 who live in our area. I found out     
 that:                                 
                                       
 - most women considered themselves to 
   be{housewives and mothers first.    
                                       
 - many of the{women did part-time jobs
   in supermarkets, as secretaries or  
   as teachers.                        
                                       
 - three men worked in the{clay works.

   kind.
