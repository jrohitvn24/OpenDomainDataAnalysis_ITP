		<content> In Hackforth there are about 40       
 houses.There are only five council    
 houses and two council flats.A few of 
 the other houses are still owned by   
 Hornby Castle estate and the farm     
 workers live in them but the majority 
 are privately owned.Over half of the  
 houses are either detached or         
 semi-detached.Except for the coucil   
 houses nearly all the others are built
 from stone.Many are quite old and have
 been modernised. All the houses have  
 some garden by them and most ofthem   
 have a garage.There are some "listed  
 buildings" for example Roundhill Farm 
 and Manor Farm.
