		<content> All three churches are low in         
 attendance with as little as 24       
 attending morning services at the     
 United Reform and at the Catholic     
 Churches. The main activities in the  
 village are scouts, cubs, guides,     
 Women's Institutes, Youth club, Good  
 Companions, Drama Group, badminton,   
 horse riding, British Legion Club.    
 There is a Village Hall &amp; Youth Centre
 which are both occupied each evening  
 of the week with various activities.  
 The Youth Centre also accomodates the 
 Scout &amp; Guide organisations. The      
 majority of the people who do work in 
 or around the village are either      
 builders, decorators, service trades, 
 shop assistants, farm workers.
