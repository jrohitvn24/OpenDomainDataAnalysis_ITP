<title>21Grange Farm</title>
<content>

Grange Farm has been in the Gray family since 1940. It is an organic farm that extends to 830 acres, with 400 head of cattle and 300 acres of crops.&lt;br />&lt;br />The cattle comprise a suckler herd of 100 cows, which calve in the spring to a South Devon or Aberdeen Angus bull. The calves stay with their mothers until the following winter and are then grown on to be sold as beef animals at 20 months of age. Some of the other cattle are bought in from organic farms on the Welsh borders or East Sussex. There are four bulls.&lt;br />&lt;br />Wheat and oats are grown in rotation with red clover and grass. The oats are used to feed the cattle in the winter, together with the clover and grass. The wheat is sold, usually for biscuit making.&lt;br />&lt;br />There are four full-time and one part-time employees, using four tractors and a JCB.&lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
