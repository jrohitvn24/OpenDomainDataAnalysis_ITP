		<title>04HILLESDEN CHURCH</title>
		<content> Hillesden Church has been called "The 
 Cathedral in the field". Begun in the 
 13th century it has had a very        
 chequered history. It was rebuilt by  
 monks in the 14th century. The doors  
 to this day bear the marks of shot    
 fired during the Civil War. At this   
 time too 30 or 40 Royalist prisoners  
 were put to death in the churchyard.  
 Early in the 18th century the church  
 was further damaged by fire. At the   
 beginning of the 19th century this    
 fine building was visited by a young  
 boy from the neighbouring village of  
 Gawcott. It is reputed that Hillesden 
 Church inspired the young Gilbert     
 Scott (later Sir Giles Gilbert Scott) 
 to devote his life to ecclesiastical  
 architecture. Restoration work was    
 carried out in the 1950s.
