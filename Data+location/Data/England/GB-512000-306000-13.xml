		<title>13Farming Part 2</title>
		<content> The farmer follows a similar pattern  
 with each of the crops he grows. First
 he prepares the land by ploughing,    
 then he sows the seeds. He puts       
 fertilizer and pesticide on the field.
 These protect the crops from attack by
 insects and moulds. As the crop grows 
 he puts a growth regulator on. This   
 stops the crop growing so tall that it
 falls over. Then he waits for it to   
 ripen. When it is ready the crop is   
 harvested by machine and processed    
 into it's final product. Wheat is     
 turned into flour and made into bread 
 and cakes, barley and triticale are   
 used in the brewing process or used as
 animal food, the oil is extracted from
 rape and used as vegetable oil in     
 cooking, potatoes are used as a food  
 crop for either animals or humans and 
 sugar-beet is taken into Peterborough 
 where the sugar is extracted.         </content>
