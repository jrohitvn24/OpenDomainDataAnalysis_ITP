		<content>  The school was built by Sir Robert   
 Smirke,straight after he finished     
 building the castle,so now it is about
 160 years old.                        
  As a C.E school we go to church on   
 festivals,e.g. Mothering Sunday,      
 Harvest,and Christmas.                
  The school had not been altered at   
 all until this summer term of 1985,   
 when the whole rear area of the school
 is being demolished and rebuilt.The   
 new accomodation will include a       
 library,kitchen,staff room and        
 toilets.The whole school is also being
 redecorated and carpeted.             
  The numbers of the school were at    
 their lowest in 1978/9 with 24 on roll
 but numbers here are now at the peak  
 of 42, with 2 full time teaching staff
 and 4 ancillary staff.
