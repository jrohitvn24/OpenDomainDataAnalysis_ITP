		<content> Until 1970 this land was farming and  
 agricultural land. When the decision  
 was taken to develop a new city, the  
 land was purchased by Milton Keynes   
 Development Corporation. Since 1970   
 the area has been developed towards a 
 target  of housing and employment for 
 a quarter of a million people. The    
 area contains council estates and     
 owner occupier housing, privately     
 developed. Each area has a small      
 shopping complex, good roads, redways,
 schools, community and sports         
 facilities. Existing villages were    
 retained in the planning, providing a 
 variety of environment. Existing      
 hedgerows were retained, avenues of   
 trees planted along the roads,        
 roundabouts and verges were           
 landscaped. The Grand Union Canal and 
 the M1 motorway pass through. Willen  
 Lake was developed for leisure.       </content>
