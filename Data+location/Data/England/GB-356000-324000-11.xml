 Much of the village or local news is  
 given by the locally printed Parish   
 Magazine, edited by a Stanton Village 
 resident.  Forthcoming events are     
 mixed with topics of local interest.  
 Regular features such as gardening    
 news and recipes make up much of the  
 bulk of reading.  The telephone is    
 found in most of the outlying homes   
 and one telephone box for public use  
 is in the village proper.  The postman
 carries stamps for sale to those      
 people lacking transport to the Post  
 Office.  This practice is one not     
 advised by the Post Office and carried
 out only by those postmen who wish to.
