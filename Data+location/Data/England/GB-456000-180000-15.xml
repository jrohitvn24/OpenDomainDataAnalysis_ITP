      Well's Stores began as a village 
 shop in 1834, but 20-30 yers ago it   
 started specialising in{cheese.} It   
 sells more than 150 kinds of cheese,  
 including goats' and sheep's milk     
 cheeses, French and English cheeses.  
 The most popular cheese is{Farmhouse  
{Cheddar.}                             
                                       
      Much of the{English cheese}comes 
 from individual farms.  Each farm has 
 a different kind of soil which makes  
 the grass different so that the cheese
 produced on that farm has its own     
 distinctive taste.                    
                                       
      People travel long distances to  
 buy cheese here and the shop also     
 sends cheese all over the world.  Most
 goes to restaurants and hotels, and   
 some to private mail-order customers. </content>
