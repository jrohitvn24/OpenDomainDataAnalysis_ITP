    This very rural area in Shropshire 
 has 1 village and 2 hamlets within its
 limits.It is quite high with superb   
 views across Apedale looking towards  
 Wenlok Edge.The north-west and western
 edges of the block are highest and    
 parts of this are open moorland.      
   Cardington village has been declared
 a conservation area and contains some 
 lovely houses and cottages built of   
 local stone.A number of the residents 
 have chosen to live in this attractive
 area and commute to their employment  
 in outlying towns.                    
   Population,apart from this village  
 is sparse and most people are         
 concerned with farming.Cardington is  
 used as their centre for Social       
 Activities as it has a Church,a pub   
 and a village hall.
