		<title>17WOODLEIGH WOOD</title>
		<content> Deciduous woodland extends along      
 virtually the whole length of the     
 steep eastern flanks of the Avon      
 valley, and along about half of the   
 western slopes.                       
 Woodleigh Wood is typical of these    
 woods, and is being maintained by The 
 Woodland Trust. There is a public     
 footpath, or one can follow the nearby
 old railway track.                    
 The trees are mixed, with mature oak  
 and beech, and some sweet chestnut.   
 Ash and sycamore are very common,the  
 latter seeding itself very freely.    
 At the northern end some birch are    
 seeding. Along the nearby old railway 
 track sycamore, ash, alder and birch  
 are taking over. In the wood hazel and
 holly form a lower layer.             
 The woodland floor is very colourful  
 in spring, with bluebells,wild garlic,
 wild daffodils, campions and ferns.   </content>
