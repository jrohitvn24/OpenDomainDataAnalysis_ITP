		<content> Childs Ercall has mains water which is
 piped to the village it is suppled by 
{Severn Trent Water}authority,the water
 is stored underground in three storage
 tanks with  corrugated iron roofs     
 over like covers and there are pipes  
 around the village.                   
 We have electricity which is supplied 
 by the{Midlands Electricity Board.    
 The North sea Gas main passes along   
 our area but the cost of connecting it
 to the village is too high.           
 We have a sewage plant in Childs      
 Ercall. Most rural areas have septic  
 drainage which is maintained by the   
 householder. The sewage system in     
 Childs Ercall was put in during the   
 second world war to cater for the     
 large number of service men living in 
 the village.
