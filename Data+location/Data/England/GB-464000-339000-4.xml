		<content>   In Shelford there are six main types
 of housing.These are cottages,mainly  
 Victorian or modern but there are some
 older than Victorian.A new housing    
 group has been put on West Street.They
 have nice modern names like Hebron and
 Tarka! An example of a Victorian house
 is Holly Cottage or Scarborough House.
 A sign that the houses are Victorian  
 is the brick work and in some cases   
 the surroundings.Walnut Tree Cottage  
 is an old cottage.It has been in a    
 lady called Mrs Fishers family for    
 four hundred years.There is a big     
 church on Church Street and it is the 
 only church in Shelford.It is         
 attractive,and in the church yard     
 there are conifers and deciduous      
 trees.
