		<title>01THE DODDINGHURST AREA</title>
		<content> This survey area includes the villages
 of{Doddinghurst, Stondon Massey}and   
{Kelvedon Hatch}which together with    
{Blackmore}and{Bentley}are locally     
 known as the Five Parishes. These once
 isolated villages are now surrounded  
 by large housing estates built on land
 sold to developers in the fifties and 
 sixties. And, despite the farms which 
 still flourish in the area, the       
 character of the villages and the     
 lifestyle of their inhabitants is     
 suburban rather than rural.{Brentwood,
 2 miles away, is the nearest large    
 town;{Chelmsford}is 8 miles distant   
 and{London}is 35 minutes by train     
 from stations at{Shenfield}and        
 Brentwood or, by road, 25 miles on the
 A12. And now the newly opened{M25,    
 three miles distant, links our area   
 into all the main trunk routes of     
 South East England.                   </content>
