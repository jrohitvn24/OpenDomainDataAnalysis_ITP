		<title>15Farming at Pouchen End</title>
		<content> This is a small farm of 80 acres that 
 is run by the owner and his son.They  
 have occasional help at busy times.   
 The farmer described some of the many 
 jobs they have to do including tractor
 and combine driving,field work,mucking
 out and feeding animals,building and  
 maintaining outbuildings, getting in  
 feed etc.,harvesting and hay making.He
 worked long hard hours but enjoyed    
 it.Unlike an office job you grab a bit
 of spare time when you can get it,    
 usually when the weather is very wet. 
 They have 5 breeding sows who produce 
 two litters each year,and have 1 field
 for horse grazing.They grow mainly    
 winter wheat and barley with a little 
 spring barley and grass for hay.      
 Some barley is used as pig feed,some  
 goes for maltings for beer but most of
 it goes to Piccotts End Mill to be    
 made into cattle feed.                </content>
