 North of Histon is were we have been  
 studying.We have been talking to many 
 different people about the way they   
 live in the 1980's.We talked to Mrs.  
 Chapman and Mr.&amp; Mrs.Wyatt about      
 farming.There isn't many shops in the 
 area but we talked to two people who  
 own a shop.Their names were Mrs.Pullan
 and Mrs.Pearson.Dr.Ravensdale talked  
 about the history of Landbeach.Rev.   
 Mac.Donald-Milne and Mrs.White told us
 about village life.Also on the disc   
 there are a few pages about what the  
 area consists of and some games the   
 children play.On another page there   
 are all the British foods that we     
 eat.On a couple of pages there is a   
 description of a families day.
