		<title>16PACK MONDAY FAIR, SHERBORNE.</title>
		<content> This local tradition goes back to 18th
 century or earlier. First called      
 Michaelmas Fair, and still held on the
 first Monday after old Michaelmas day 
 (10th Oct). Name comes from"pact" or  
 agreement made between farmer and     
 worker at these hiring fairs. It was  
 also a cattle and sheep fair.         
  In the 19th century, was announced   
 by urchins blowing cows horns after   
 clock struck midnight. Now a street   
 market and fun fair, it is heralded by
 a midnight procession of "Teddy Roe's 
 Band". This  band is of recent origin 
 but music stems from pagan times when 
 noise was to scare devils. Stalls now 
 in Cheap Street, Half Moon Street and 
 Digby Road. Fun fair on the Terrace.  
 Stalls run by "Cheap-Jacks", selling  
 clothes, fancy goods, household goods 
 and fast food.
