		<content> The Parish Church of St. Mary         
 Magdalene is the third to stand on the
 site and took 300 years to build being
 completed in the 16th century.  The   
 240 feet spire dominates the landscape
 for miles around.  The church went    
 into decay in the 17th and 18th       
 centuries and restoration work took   
 place in the 19th century, continuing 
 up to the present day.  In the recent 
 60's an appeal for Â£40,000 was        
 successful and the money was used to  
 restore the exterior stonework and to 
 renew the interior.  The churchyard   
 has been made into a public garden    
 where visitors and locals can rest and
 take in the majesty of this splendid  
 building.  The church proves an       
 important tourist attraction for this 
 market town.
