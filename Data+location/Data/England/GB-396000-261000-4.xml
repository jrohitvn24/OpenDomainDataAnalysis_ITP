{Schoolgirl.}                          
 My Daddy wakes me up at half past six 
 and gives me a drink of orange squash 
 and then I read a library book for a  
 few minutes. I get dressed into my    
 school clothes and I go downstairs to 
 eat my breakfast. For my breakfast I  
 have a bowl of cereals and some toast 
 and marmalade. After breakfast I      
 practice my piano tunes then I read   
 for a while. Then I have a wash and   
 brush my teeth. My Daddy or my Mummy  
 takes me to school.                   
 When I get to school I go out to play.
 School starts at nine o' clock. We go 
 to assembly and have a song and a     
 story and then we say some prayers.   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
