		<content>  The streets bordering the area we    
 have explored are Cheetham Hill Rd.,  
 Mottram Road, and Yew Tree Lane.      
 Grosvenor Rd. By-Pass was built to    
 relieve the traffic congestion in     
 Stalybridge centre. This is a         
 description of the first two roads,   
 which we saw as typical of the area.  
 The children wrote, 'as we went down  
 Cheetham Hill Road we saw the Futura  
 Rubber Company, which makes footwear. 
 On the way we passed lots of pubs.    
 Here are some of their names. The     
 Feathers, The Liston, The Stone Jug,  
 Old Hunters' Tavern, Hare and Hound,  
 Dog and Partridge, and Wagon and      
 Horses.  In Lord St., we passed a     
 playground. In the new Shopping       
 Arcade, there is a Butchers, a        
 Greengrocers, a Post Office,          
 Newsagents, Bakers, Laundrette,       
 Supermarket, and Fashion Shop.        </content>
