 lake. In the lake you can catch fish  
 tadpoles and frogs. There are signs   
 which tell you what kind of fish you  
 can catch.                            
    Mallard,Dabchick,Moorhen and Coot  
 all raise their young around the lake.
 At a quiet part of the lake there is  
 a hide where you can watch these water
 birds.There is another hide for       
 watching woodland birds.
