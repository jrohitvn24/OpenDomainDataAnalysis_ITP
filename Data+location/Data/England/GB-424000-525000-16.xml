		<title>16WOODHAM BURN.</title>
		<content> Woodham Burn is a stream that runs    
 into the River Skerne. Sometimes, if  
 you are lucky, you may see some water 
 rats.You can also see many birds,     
 including house martins and           
 blackbirds. In a fallen tree there is 
 a wasps' nest and a yellow and black, 
 stripey snail shell. Also to be seen  
 are slugs and thousands of midgies fly
 around the banks. Froghoppers can be  
 seen on the plants around the banks.  
 Amongst the garbage in the stream are 
 golf balls, bricks, drain covers and  
 shopping trolleys. Quite a selection  
 of beetles live there. There are      
 greenfly for ladybirds to live on.    
 Cabbage white butterflies are common  
 along with some other species of      
 butterfly. Not many fish, apart from  
 the occasional stickleback, live there
 because of the constant dumping of    
 rubbish. Isn't that a shame?          </content>
