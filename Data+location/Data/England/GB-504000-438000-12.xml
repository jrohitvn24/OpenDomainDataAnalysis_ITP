		<title>12Industry in Beverley (East)</title>
		<content> At one time Beverley had a ship yard  
 that launched ships sideways into the 
 River Hull, but that is now closed.   
      We went looking on Swinemoor     
 Industrial Estate to see which        
 industries were now taking the place  
 of shipbuilding.  This is what we     
 found.                                
      The largest firm is,             
 "Marine Containers". They make and    
 repair huge metal containers to be    
 used on ships using Hull, Goole,      
 Immimgham and other nearby ports.     
      We also saw firms that made      
 caravans,boat-builders,a firm hiring  
 portable toilets,plant hire           
 firms,builders merchants,garages for  
 cars,council offices,an ambulance     
 station and a firm that made bedroom  
 furniture and kitchens.               
                                       
                                       </content>
