		<title>06FARMING, MEREACRE ESTATE</title>
		<content>    Mereacre Estate comprises a few    
 farms,but the majority of the land    
 comes from the old Longwood Estate.   
    There are many trees on the Estate.
 Oak trees are not common, a few oak   
 trees are sent to the woodmills to be 
 made into furniture.                  
    Elms are also scarce because of a  
 disease. A small bug gets into the    
 heart of the wood of the tree and the 
 tree disintergrates into a fine dust. 
 The elms are sprayed with chemicals in
 an attempt to preserve the trees.     
    Hazel and ash trees grow the best  
 on the chalk soil.                    
    The Mereacre Estate look after     
 their trees well, and have a programme
 of re-planting.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
