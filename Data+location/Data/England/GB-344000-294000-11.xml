		<title>11CHURCH STRETTON GOLF CLUB</title>
		<content>    The Golf Club was founded in 1898. 
 It is about{1200 feet above sea level.
 It is the second highest in England.  
 From the second tee you can see nearly
 all of Church Stretton, and from the  
 Golf Course are some of the finest    
 views in the world.                   
    The Golf Course is a very difficult
 one. It is very hilly. There are 18   
 holes. If you go off the fairway, you 
 have to be lucky to find your ball. On
 the third hole you have to be lucky   
 not to hit it down the valley.        
    There are 305 members. There are   
 190 full male members, 40 lady        
 members, 50 junior members and 25     
 social members.                       
    There is a junior evening every    
 Friday and this year two of our       
 juniors have played for the County.   
    The annual subscription rate for   
 male members in 1985 is Â£98.          </content>
