		<content>  Sudbury's shops, market, schools and 
leisure facilities attract many people 
from the surrounding villages like     
Melford, Acton, Clare, Glemsford and   
Boxted; public transport is therefore  
important to the area.                 
BUSES-There are six firms running bus  
services to and from Sudbury, four of  
these are private. The national        
companies run services between the     
larger towns every day but the private 
firms which visit the villages do not  
operate on Sundays nor run weekday     
services later than about 8.00pm.      
TRAINS-Sudbury is the terminus of a    
branch line which runs trains to and   
from Colchester with connections to    
London and the rest of East Anglia.The 
service is infrequent and finishes     
early. The station is unmanned and     
dilapidated.  BY ABIGAIL FLETCHER, EMMA
