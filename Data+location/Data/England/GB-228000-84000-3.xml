		<title>03The Valley</title>
		<content> The valley was made by the River      
 Kensey.The river is small and         
 therefore not navigable. Also in the  
 valley there is  the Launceston Steam 
 Railway which follows the track of the
 former Southern Railway. The line used
 to run as far as Padstow and carried  
 the Atlantic Coast Express.The train  
 which takes you on your ride runs just
 inside our area.The tracks run as far 
 as the bridge along  Underlane.It is  
 hoped that the restored railway will  
 run as far as Newmills.Along Underlane
 is a breakers yard.At the height of   
 summer Underlane is only seven feet   
 wide because of the hedge growth.     
 Fortunately there are regular passing 
 places.South of Athill Farm is a ford 
 of the Kensey, now used only by large 
 lorries and tractors.
