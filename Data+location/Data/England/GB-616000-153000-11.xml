		<title>11CHANGES IN BEKESBOURNE</title>
		<content> I live in Bekesbourne I like it       
 there.There is a station in           
 Bekesbourne, my dad uses the train to 
 get to London but not every day.There 
 is also a church and we walk through  
 the churchyard,I read the grave       
 stones.There is an old Aerodrome but  
 there aren't any aeroplanes now.The   
 Aerodrome was used in the war.        
 Bekesbourne School closed in{1971}    
 and the children from Bekesbourne now 
 go to Bridge Primary School.The new   
 Bridge School was opened in{1971.}    
 Before that children from             
 Bridge,Patrixbourne and Bishopsbourne 
 went to the old school in Patrixbourne
 Road.Bishopsbourne School closed in{  
{1951.}In{1953}Bridge School had three 
 classes for children from 5_11.At the 
 age of 11 children went to the        
 Secondary Modern School at Sturry or  
 the Simon Langton Grammer School.     </content>
