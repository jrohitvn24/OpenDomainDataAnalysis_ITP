		<title>09Entertainment in Pennington</title>
		<content>  A great deal of the entertainment in 
 Pennington takes place in the Memorial
 Hall.It is managed by two villagers   
 and each club in the village is       
 allowed one representative on the     
 Memorial Hall Committee.Entertainment 
 in the village is advertised in the   
 Chit Chat newspaper.Twice weekly      
 children and adults are entertained by
 performing Latin American dancing,old 
 time and mordern ballroom dancing.They
 have learned about fifty dances.      
 Sometimes the Morris Men come to      
 entertain us.They provide lots of fun 
 for the family.Every year in February 
 the villagers perform a pantomime at  
 the Memorial Hall.Both children and   
 adults take part.In 1983 we did       
 Sleeping Beauty which is about a girl 
 who has a spell put on her at her     
 christening.The spell is broken when  
 she is kissed by a prince.            </content>
