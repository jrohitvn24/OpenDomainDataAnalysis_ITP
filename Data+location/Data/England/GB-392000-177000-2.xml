		<content> Sutton Benger was already established 
 in 1066 with "Sudtone" or "Sudtun"    
 meaning south farmstead. Berenger was 
 an under-tenant of Hullavington manor.
 The name is of Saxon origin and was   
 pronounced "Burungurr", which was     
 slurred in the broad Wessex manner to 
 Benger.                               
 When a new housing estate was built in
 Sutton Benger in the 1970s the roads  
 were named after well-known local     
 figures, such as Lord Cowley, Farmer  
 Lee, and Canon Westlake.              
 Draycot Cerne was derived from "draeg-
 cot" which is old English for         
 "cottages by a drag or combe", and    
 from Henry de Cerne who was Lord of   
 the Manor in 1228.                    
 Clanville in the north-west of the    
 area was known as "Clane-fued" in 1256
 - a typical mispronounciation of      
 "Clean field".                        </content>
