		<title>08The Convent</title>
		<content> There were originally three houses at 
 the site of the convent at Wroughton  
 which is along the pitchens.These     
 three houses were founded by the      
 presentation sisters.The nuns who are 
 living there now came in 1964 and are 
 of the order of servants of the HOLY  
 SPIRIT.At the present time there are  
 twelve nuns living there,some of      
 their constitutions (rules) are to    
 love  GOD and to love your            
 neighbour.The nuns do a great deal of 
 cummunity work and one sister visits  
 the surrounding villages.They also    
 hold group meetings at the convert for
 such people like the lydia ladies  and
 the social service.One of the jobs of 
 some of the nuns is to teach some of  
 the visiting foreign nuns english.The 
 nuns come from most parts of the world
 especially Europe and the far east.   
 Some of the nuns will not stay at this</content>
