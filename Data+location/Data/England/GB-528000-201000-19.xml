		<title>19THE LEGEND OF SIGAR-NORTHAW.</title>
		<content> Northaw Woods was once owned by the   
 Abbot of St Albans and the "Hermit"   
 Monks.These monks preferred to live   
 quietly and spent most of their time  
 praying.In 948 they built a small     
 chapel to use,on the site of the      
 Parish Church of St.Thomas of         
 Canterbury.One monk,Sigar, loved all  
 woodland animals especially the birds.
 Sigar would travel by night to        
 St.Albans to attend and worship in    
 matins.After these,he would return to 
 another full day of prayer and study  
 in the peace of the wood.The stillness
 was often broken by the songs of the  
 Nightingales,so he prayed to God to   
 have them removed.While he lived      
 nightingales avoided the place.Sigar  
 died and was buried in the Abbey at   
 St.Albans and for many days after the 
 city was filled with Northaw birds!   
 Many years later the birds returned.  </content>
