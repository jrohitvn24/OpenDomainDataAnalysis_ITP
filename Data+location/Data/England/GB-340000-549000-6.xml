		<title>06PIG FARM _ WOODSIDE(PART I)</title>
		<content> This is one of 3 owned by{CAVAGHAN}   
 and{GRAY LTD.}of Carlisle.It is       
 managed by a husband and wife team    
 helped by a student.It is an intensive
 farm,the pigs being kept in single    
 pens indoors.Here there are 300       
 breeding sows and 16 boars.Each litter
 averages 9 to 10 piglets which  weigh 
 about 3 to 4Kg each at birth.Each sow 
 has 2.3 litters a year.The pigs are   
 kept for 5.5 months when they weigh   
 about 90Kgs.The animals are fed on a  
 mixture of barley,soya,vitamins and   
 minerals in exact amounts worked out  
 each time by a computer.The farm has  
 a 250 acre field which it uses to grow
 barley but this is not enough and most
 of the food has to be bought in.One   
 interesting thing that we were told is
 that when pigs are born they have {   
{tusks}which have to be cut out or they
 would hurt each other.                </content>
