		<title>02THE BOLLIN VALLEY PROJECT</title>
		<content>    The River Bollin flows through the 
 east of Cheshire, it is 34 miles long.
 It is a small river and in other parts
 of England it would not be very       
 important but over 2,000,000 people   
 live only half an hours drive away    
 from the Bollin. Many of these people 
 want to picnic by and play in, look   
 at, fish in, walk by and enjoy        
 themselves in the river. All these    
 visitors could annoy the farmers by   
 making noise, dropping litter and     
 walking on their land. The Bollin     
 Valley Project was set up to help the 
 public enjoy the Valley while not     
 disturbing the farmers.  There are    
 full time and part time Rangers who   
 put sign posts and stiles up, plant   
 trees, answer visitors' questions and 
 help people in many ways.
