		<content> The Church of St.Swithun in the       
 Village is a fine example of an early 
 thirteenth century Wool Church.It is  
 large by village standards and in an  
 excellent state of repair.Leadenham   
 has many feudal aspects.It always has 
 had,and still has,a squire who is also
 the Patron of the Church.In Leadenham 
 he has not only appointed the Rector  
 but down the ages encouraged the      
 villagers to care for and support the 
 Church.This has resulted in a well    
 maintained and loved Church which is  
 an integral part of the life of the   
 community.There are certain occasions 
 in the year when the village goes to  
 Church.The death of a Villager,Harvest
 or Christmas for example sees this    
 fine old building full of people.At   
 other times it is like any other rural
 Church when the faithful attend for   
 the worship of God.                   </content>
