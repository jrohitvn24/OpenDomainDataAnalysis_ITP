		<content> There is only one shop in BURTON      
 HASTINGS which is a Post Office       
 which also sells confectionery. This  
 buillding dates from 1830 and used to 
 be a garage. There is one telephone   
 box for the 200 inhabitants.The       
 population has to travel out of the   
 village to Wolvey, Nuneaton or        
 Hinckley for their entertainment since
 there is no public house, cinema or   
 community meeting place in the        
 village.  The nearest garage is in    
 Wolvey or Nuneaton and there is       
 an infrequent 'bus service.The        
 newspapers come from Nuneaton and     
 Hinckley and are delivered by local   
 residents.Children have to travel by  
 'bus to school in Wolvey until they   
 are 12 years old when they transfer to
 Bedworth.Some of the women have formed
 a catering business and prepare food  
 for functions in the area.            </content>
