		<title>05        GUILDFORD FARM</title>
		<content>   Guildford Farm dates back to 1490.  
 It is situated south of Fishbourne    
 and 5 km East of Newport in a peaceful
 area of country-side.  It belongs to  
 Mr.C.A.E Biggs who is a retired       
 farmer.                               
    The farm originally covered        
 98 acres but 60 acres were sold to    
 neighbouring farms. The remaining     
 acres are mostly let for grazing.     
    Maximum livestock here was formerly
 12 heifers, 8 calves, 44 milking cows 
 and 650 chickens and a couple of      
 cockerels. {Produce:}80% of all eggs  
 were  graded and sold to local shops  
 and grocers. The eggs did better than 
 any other farm activity. Milk was sold
 and was quite profitable.             
    Mr &amp; Mrs Biggs now run a basketry  
 and cane furniture shop, which is very
 successful. Furniture is bought from  
 Somerset and all over the world.      </content>
