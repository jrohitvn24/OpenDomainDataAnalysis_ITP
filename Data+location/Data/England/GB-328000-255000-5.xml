		<content>  Lady Hawkins'School was founded under
 the will dated 1619 of Dame Margaret  
 Hawkins,whose portrait is in the      
 school entrance,wife of the famous Sir
 John Hawkins. The school was opened on
 September 29th 1632. Girls were not   
 allowed to go to the school until     
 September 26th 1907. The school was   
 built by John Abel, "The King's       
 Carpenter" who built many buildings in
 the Herefordshire market towns. There 
 used to be some antique Latin books in
 the school. They have recently been   
 donated to Hereford Cathedral Library.
 The school was a grammer school but   
 has now changed to a comprehansive. It
 caters for people aged 11-18. There   
 have been many schools in Kington     
 including the Charity School, National
 School, Elementary School and the     
 Primary School, the former being the  
 only one of these still running.      </content>
