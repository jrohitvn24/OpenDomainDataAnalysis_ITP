		<content> In 1945 our school secretary was 11   
 years old.The school had 90 pupils in 
 4 classrooms.They were very strict.If 
 you were late for school you would get
 the cane.You were hardly allowed to   
 move!There were no school dinners.    
 There were about 700 people in the    
 village. The houses were small.Some   
 had ladders to get upstairs.Few had   
 bathrooms and many had to get all the 
 water from standpipes in the street.  
 There were 4 shops and a butcher,baker
 coalman and milkman.He had his own    
 cows and took the milk round in cans  
 and people brought jugs to the door.  
 A lot of people kept chickens and a   
 pig.The pig was fed on scraps.It was  
 killed by the butcher and was then    
 salted.It would keep for a year.There 
 were 3 Pubs and 2 Chapels and a Black-
 smith.There were hardly any cars or   
 bikes.24 aniseed balls cost a H'penny.</content>
