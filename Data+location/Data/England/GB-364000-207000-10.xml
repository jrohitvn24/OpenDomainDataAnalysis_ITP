		<title>10FREEMINING</title>
		<content>   Mining in the forest almost         
 certainly goes back to the Iron Age   
 and in Norman times iron was so       
 important to the nation's economy and 
 security that the iron miner and      
 blacksmith became privileged; perhaps 
 here freemining has its origins. The  
 inhabitants of Dean won acclaim in the
 reign of Edward I for their military  
 activities at the Seige of Berwick and
 were rewarded with rights to mine     
 within the Hundred of St. Briavels    
 (much of the Forest of Dean). To      
 qualify as a freeminer a man must be  
 born in this area and have worked in a
 mine for a year and a day. He can then
 apply to the Deputy Gaveller for a    
 'gale' - the right to mine a certain  
 area. Few active such mines exist     
 today; one in this area at Danby Lodge
 is worked by two men and produces coal
 for themselves and power stations.    </content>
