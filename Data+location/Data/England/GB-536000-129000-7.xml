		<title>07Highbrook - Church</title>
		<content> All Saints Highbrook, a handsome      
 Anglican church built 100 years ago by
 private benefaction, to save villagers
 the walk to West Hoathly in winter,   
 serves a relatively small but active  
 community. Since 1940 the parish has  
 been combined with West Hoathly, so it
 does not have a full range of services
  each Sunday. It has its own Parochial
 Church council, Church Wardens and    
 distinctive views on worship, guarding
 its independent entity. It remains an 
 important focus of interest in the    
 hamlet of Highbrook and the church is 
 usually well attended.The churchyard  
 contains memorials to the Clarke      
 family, prominent landowners whose    
 fortune was originally based on the   
 Coal Industry. It also contains one   
  old "leaping board" memorial.
