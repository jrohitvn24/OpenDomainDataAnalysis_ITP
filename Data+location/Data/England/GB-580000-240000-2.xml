{          }Belchamp with the 'ch'     
 pronounced as 'sh' means good land or 
 beautiful fields. The three out of    
 four surviving Belchamps  Otten,      
 Walter and St Pauls (which is outside 
 our area) are in an agricultural area 
 which has been farmed for hundreds of 
 years.                                
      Walter means great and Otten     
 little. Belchamp Otten has always been
 smaller than Walter but in the last   
 100 years the population of both      
 village has declined by 2/3rds, both  
 local schools closing in this time.   
    The names are said to be of saxon  
 origin verified by the village of     
 Belchamp St Ethelbert, St Ethelbert   
 being a saxon saint. Belchamp is      
 also said to mean on a ridge (a       
 confusion of a French word) if you    
 take the derivation as being French.  </content>
