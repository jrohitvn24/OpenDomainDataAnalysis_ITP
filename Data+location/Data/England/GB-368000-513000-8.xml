 Most people in our area are farmers.  
 Some young people start farming when  
 they leave school.Two or three men go 
 to work at the police headquarters at 
 Penrith.About two people go to work at
 garages.Four people drive wagons.We   
 have three teachers in the village.A  
 tanker driver lives outside the       
 village who works for the dairy at    
 Appleby.In our area very few people   
 are unemployed. People get jobs from  
 the dairy,police headquarters,shops   
 and banks.The reason there aren't many
 unemployed people is that there aren't
 many people to be unemployed.
