		<content> A.HOSKINS &amp; SON,  THE CARPENTER'S     
 SHOP, WHITTON, FUNERAL DIRECTOR,      
 Records show that  a John Hoskins was 
 a funeral director in 1890. The cost  
 of a funeral then was Â£8..6..6 (now it
 costs several hundred pounds,         
 according to requirements). The       
 business has been handed down from    
 father to son and Reg, the present    
 proprietor, continues to make coffins 
 much as they were in his grandfather's
 day,mostly from oak with elm bottoms. 
 When a person dies they are brought to
 the Chapel of Rest where there is a   
 cold room. Each coffin is made for the
 individual and can have brass or      
 nickel handles etc.(wooden if a       
 cremation is desired). The inside is  
 lined with white material with a white
 satin frill.A shroud of white,pink or 
 blue satin is put on the deceased.    
 Relatives come and view if they wish. </content>
