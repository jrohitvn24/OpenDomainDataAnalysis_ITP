		<content> 1985 has been a very wet year for     
 this part of the country and the      
 farmers have also had to contend with 
 a cold spring and cool summer .       
 Consequently, the harvest of all crops
 is late, by about three weeks . There 
 has been more disease on the crops    
 than normal. Yields are as much as 30%
 down on the 1984 figure in some       
 fields. Quite a lot of the barley and 
 winter wheat were dashed down be      
 exceptionally heavy rain in June, and 
 a recorded two and threequarter inches
 of hail and rain fell in the afternoon
 of 17th June, causing much damage and 
 concern. As a result of this, there   
 was regrowth in the fields and later  
 the weeds also grew through the       
 flattened cereal stalks. However, the 
 modern combine harvester, with a      
 careful hand on the controls, can pick
 up the laying crop.  (See slide)      </content>
