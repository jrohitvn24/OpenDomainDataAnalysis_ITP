		<title>10THE CHURCHES</title>
		<content> The churches at Buxton and at Lammas  
 will be described here.               
 It is interesting to note that the two
 churches, which are about a mile      
 apart, are both dedicated to St.      
 Andrew. They come under the charge of 
 the Revd. Frank Richard Knight Hare   
 M.A.                                  
 Both churches are built of flint with 
 limestone cornering and are in good   
 repair. They have only morning        
 services and both have family services
 once a month.                         
 Both churches date from the 13th      
 century.                              
 Both churches have their own Wardens  
 and Parochial Church Councils.        
 Buxton Church is in the centre of the 
 village whilst Lammas Church is rather
 seperate standing across a meadow and 
 beautifully placed on the banks of the
 River Bure.                           </content>
