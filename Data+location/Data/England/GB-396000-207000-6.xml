		<title>06THE CHURCH,DUNTISBOURNE</title>
		<content> In Duntisbourne Abbots the church,St  
 Peter's,is in the centre of the       
 village on a higher level overlooking 
 the valley of the Dunt.The cream      
 lychgate ,on a central pivot, is      
 particularly interesting .A tree-lined
 path takes you up to the church door. 
 People said church attendance was not 
 high ,except for a few regulars. A    
 Methodist chapel in the village is now
 a garage.In the graveyard , the stones
 are unusual because most of the       
 inscriptions are inscribed on oval    
 plaques instead of on the stone       
 itself.This has meant that many       
 inscriptions are still legible after  
 200 years.There are also daisies and  
 roses growing around the churchyard   
 which add to the picturesque sight.In 
 the tower are 3 bells and a Medieval  
 bell-frame.The Church building itself 
 is mainly Norman.                     </content>
