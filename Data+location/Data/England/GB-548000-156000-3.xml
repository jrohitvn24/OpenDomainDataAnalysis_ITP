		<content>{Post Office}We do not have a main PO  
 in our assigned block but 3 sub-post  
 offices in Dunton Green,Riverhead &amp;   
 Chipstead. There are two collections &amp;
 deliveries a day.                     
{Medical}No doctors or dentists our    
 block &amp; nearly all the children in our
 class go to a large group practice of 
 doctors just outside our area. Most go
 to Sevenoaks for their dentist.       
{Hospitals}We have no hospital either  
 but a small hospital in Sevenoaks is  
 used for minor matters. Other         
 hospitals used from here are Pembury, 
 Tunbridge Wells &amp; Farnborough.        
{Fire}There is a large fire station    
 just outside our area, and the firemen
 sometimes bring their appliance to    
 visit us on request.                  
{Refuse} Dustmen call once a week to   
 collect rubbish which has to be left  
 on the pavement ready for them.       </content>
