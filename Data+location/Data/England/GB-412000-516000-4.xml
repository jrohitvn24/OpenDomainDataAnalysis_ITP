		<content> In 1980 the village sports and        
 recreation ground was opened by the   
 Village Playing Fields Committee. It  
 has a football pitch, a tennis court  
 and various children's games. Further 
 recreation is found near the beautiful
 River Tees.  Access across the river  
 is by the Winston arch ridge built in 
 1763 and survived the floods of 1771  
 which carried off other bridges on the
 River Tees.  There are p-leasant walks
 both east and west along the river    
 where in the spring an abundance of   
 bluebells and primroses blooms.       
 Fishing with one exception is leased  
 to Stockton Angling Association.  The 
 exception is that stretch of the river
 owned by St. Andrew's Church.         
 Villagers only are allowed to fish    
 here.
