		<content>    The Southern Water Authority only  
 look after the low lying areas of     
 Britain and the county councils       
 supervise the rest of the coast.      
    Shoreham is lucky as it has a lot  
 of shingle and this is a good         
 protector as it breaks the force of   
 the sea.                              
    The Shoreham coast at the moment is
 vulnerable because the shingle is not 
 a safe foundation for the houses along
 the beach.                            
    Home life is being threatened      
 because of the lack of funds for sea  
 defences.Now the sea is trying to take
 back it's own land and the developed  
 land is in great danger.The Government
 as yet have not given the funds for   
 protection.
