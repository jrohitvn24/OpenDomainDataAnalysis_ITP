		<title>16THE STUD AND THE COMMUNITY</title>
		<content>    The foals stay at{Hare Park}Stud   
 until they are yearlings, and then    
 they are either put into training     
 (usually locally, at one of the many  
 such establishments in or around      
 Newmarket) or sent to the local sales 
 in Newmarket, which are held between  
 September and November each year.     
    Hay and corn are bought from       
 specialist corn merchants in          
 Newmarket. All the other stable       
 equipment also comes from Newmarket.  
    All the horses and foals on the    
 farm are thoroughbreds and are        
 especially bred for flat racing (of   
 which Newmarket is recognised as the  
 world's capital).                     
    This is an ideal area for the      
 rearing of horses for racing and it   
 contains all the natural and          
 commercial resources for a successful 
 stud farm.                            </content>
