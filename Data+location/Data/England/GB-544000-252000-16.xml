		<title>16Summary of Trumpington</title>
		<content>  The area between Trumpington and     
 Great Shelford is south of the city of
 Cambridge. It is largely a commuting  
 area with most people travelling daily
 to Cambridge and some to London.      
 Trumpington is close to the ringroad  
 and access to the city is good and    
 takes about ten minutes depending on  
 the traffic.                          
  Although there is a bus service many 
 people use private cars. Trumpington  
 also has a lot of through traffic     
 especially since the building of the  
 M11 and this no doubt has increased   
 trade in the village, particularly for
 the garages and public houses.        
  House prices have risen rapidly and  
 it is considered an attractive area.  
 Some houses are very large but there  
 has been more recent building of      
 modest sized semi-detatched houses.
