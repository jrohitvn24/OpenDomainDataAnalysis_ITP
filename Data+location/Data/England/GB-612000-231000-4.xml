		<title>04     The Edme Maltings</title>
		<content>{  }The Edme{Maltings Industry}in      
 Mistley has been going for 101 years. 
    The Edme make syrup for cereals and
{beer.}The syrup is made out of wheat  
 and barley which is grown in East     
 Anglia. They squash the wheat and     
 barley then boil it and then get      
 rid of the water by evaporation. The  
 syrup is put into tins or taken on    
 lorries to other factories.           
    The tins go on a conveyor belt and 
 have their lids put on by a machine.  
 Then they go under the road where they
 have their labels stuck on. Finally   
 the cans are put onto lorries and     
{exported}to the Far East, Middle East,
 Canada and America.                   
    Edme make about 5000 beer and      
 lager kits a day that is 1,825,000 a  
 year.                                 
    The left overs go to farm animals  
 for food.                             </content>
