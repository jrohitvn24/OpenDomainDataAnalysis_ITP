		<content> My area of Stockton is right in the   
 town centre and there are no houses   
 only shops. It smells a bit when      
 'punks' drop smelling bombs. There are
 no parks only a churchyard where I    
 take my dog Sabra for a walk. I am    
 lucky sometimes when I see a wedding  
 taking place, but sometimes I just see
 drunken people. At night the noise is 
 deafening as I live in a pub.

 I live at 18 Dunelm Road, Stockton.   
 Just round the back of my house is    
 Whitehouse Primary School. The houses 
 in the area have all been designed by 
 the owners. We have lived here for a  
 year and the house next door is for   
 sale. {Rachel Babur (12)
