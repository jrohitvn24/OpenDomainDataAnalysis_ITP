		<content>{A local ghost story.}                 
   On the 8th. of April 1985 Mr. Graham
 Bell sighted a ghostly woman, three   
 dogs and a young baby in Hotham Park  
 by the pond shortly before midnight.  
 After 15 seconds they disappeared. The
 ghosts came through the trees and     
 bushes. The woman seemed to be wearing
 18th Century costume. There was no one
 else in the park at the time and Mr.  
 Bell had not been drinking!           
  This is not thge first sighting of   
 ghosts in Hotham Park.  It is possible
 that the ghosts were the previous     
 inhabitants of {Hotham Park House}    
 which was built in 1792.              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
