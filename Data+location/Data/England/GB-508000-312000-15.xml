		<title>15Interview with headmistress.</title>
		<content> The headmistress of the private school
 told us the school used to be farm    
 house in 1965. When her sons were     
 small she began to teach them then    
 some people asked if their children   
 could join so she decided to start a  
 nursey school. There are three parts  
 to the school; the nursery school for 
 2-5 year olds;the junior school for   
 5-11 year olds, and the senior        
 departments for 11-16 year olds. At 16
 they leave. Now there are 400 pupils  
 who travel to the school by coaches or
 car.There are 38 teachers,5 cooks and 
 21 cleaners. She has 11 mobile        
 classrooms and cottage houses and a   
 new senior block.Some children go     
 canoeing on their lake and go on      
 skiing holidays to France or          
 Italy.When they are 16 they have      
 G.C.E. exams. They play musical       
 instruments and have a good choir.    </content>
