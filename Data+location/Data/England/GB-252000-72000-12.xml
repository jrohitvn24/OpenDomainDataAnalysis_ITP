		<content> Residents are very happy to be living 
 where they do, very much appreciating 
 their seclusion and the beauty of     
 their surroundings. They care for its 
 conservation. The general reply to the
 question "What is it like to live     
 here?" was "Fantastic, wouldn't live  
 anywhere else!" There are many young  
 people who are enthusiastic in        
 restoring their properties, preserving
 their woodlands, walking by the river,
 leaving them very little time for     
 conventional hobbies. Because of the  
 remoteness of their homes and lack of 
 public transport, they have to rely on
 the use of their own motor-vehicles.
