		<title>18Visiting Old Peoples Homes</title>
		<content> The people we visited in Old Peoples  
 Homes seemed very happy and enjoyed   
 living there.They liked it because    
 they do not have to worry about paying
 bills and getting shopping.Most of    
 them enjoyed talking,so they have     
 plenty of company if they want it.    
 We enjoyed talking and listening to   
 them because they told us about home  
 and school when they were young,and   
 also about the war.Some of them told  
 us about WW1 as well.Most old people  
 spoil their children.Usually their    
 relations visit them quite regularly. 
 Some old people just sit around doing 
 nothing,but a lot of them have        
 hobbies.The things they enjoy most are
 knitting,gardening,playing cards,bingo
 reading the newspaper and             
 magazines,crosswords,writing letters  
 and watching T.V.
