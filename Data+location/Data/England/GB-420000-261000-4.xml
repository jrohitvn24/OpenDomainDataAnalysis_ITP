 My dad,my brother &amp; I always get up at
 7a.m.and go out to do the feeding.My  
 first job is to let Lassie the dog out
 then she starts singing!Then we have  
 breakfast &amp; bed the cattle down.We    
 drive the tractor to work on          
 log-splitting,rolling,spraying or     
 spinning.It is nearly forage          
 harvesting,at the end of the month.I  
 like driving "Chug" round the yard.   
 On Wednesday 8th.May the day the      
 school goes swimming my brother &amp; I   
 got up very early and played a game   
 called T &amp; T.Then we had breakfast of 
 cereal.Then we watched T.V. Hawk the  
 Slayer was on. Then we waited in the  
 car for Mum to drive us up the road   
 to school.We went into the classroom  
 and played another game of T&amp;T.After  
 a few minutes the bell rang.We went   
 into class and later went swimming.   </content>
