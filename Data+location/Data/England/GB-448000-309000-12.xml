		<title>12CLUBS CHURCH MARKFIELD</title>
		<content> Through the years the Methodist Church
 in Markfield has been a focal point   
 for many people both spiritually and  
 socially.Today the church building is 
 used not only for church activities   
 but also to serve the community in    
 other ways such as a Play Group,      
 Dancing School,Theatre Group,singing  
 groups and children's parties.On      
 Sundays there are two services and a  
 Sunday School for children between 3  
 and 14 years.Fellowship meetings for  
 adults and young people take place    
 through the week and there is an Open 
 Door activities afternoon for the     
 elderly.Within the church there is a  
 healthy balance of young and old and  
 the activities serve to bring them all
 together.
