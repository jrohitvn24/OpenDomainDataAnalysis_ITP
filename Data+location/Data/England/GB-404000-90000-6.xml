		<content>  Our class is taking part in the      
 BBC Domesday Project and we will be   
 grateful if you could help us by      
 answering some questions.             
     We need to put on to the computer 
 disc information about events that    
 effect our area at this time.         
     Could you please let us know how  
 long have you been an MP for our      
 area?                                 
     Are there any events that have    
 happened recently that have effected  
 our area?                             
     Do you see any great changes, that
 will make a difference to Poole,      
 coming in the near future?            
     Can you think of anything you     
 would like to say about this area that
 will be of interest in the future?    
     We thank you for your help and    
 look forward to your reply.
