 The original National school was      
 opened in 1842, but has since been    
 rebuilt and extended as a church      
 school in 1914. In 1978 a new         
 staffroom was built and indoor toilets
 were installed.                       
 Central Heating was installed in 1968.
 Up to 1971 there were only two        
 teachers at the school but now a      
 mobile classroom has been sited  in   
 the playground behind the school      
 building.                             
 The school does not have its own      
 playing field but a neighbouring      
 farmer has allowed the school to use  
 one of his fields. this is marked out 
 as a football pitch inthe winter and  
 an athletics track in the summer.     
 there is a small  playground to the   
 side of the school.
