  Traffic in the town have caused many 
 problems. In the summer tourism brings
 many cars but there is not enough     
 parking space in the town centre.     
 Unfortunately road transport passing  
 through the town has to travel along  
 the promenade which can cause         
 congestion. Trade with the rest of    
 Britain is affected by poor transport 
 facilities. The main road to London   
 the A21 is often not duel             
 carriageway and bends. The main       
 railway line is slow but will soon be 
 electrified and this will reduce the  
 journey by 15 minutes. The road to the
 Channel ports is not always straight. 
 If the Channel Tunnel was built       
 Hastings industry would benefit       
 considerably.
