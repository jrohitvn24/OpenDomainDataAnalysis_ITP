		<title>02  Eastham - Dock Interview</title>
		<content>     The main feature of Eastham       
 village is the {Queen Elizabeth Dock, 
 though it is only 20 years old. Before
 it was built there were fields and    
 ponds where the cattle and sheep used 
 to graze. When the dock was built     
 there were about 70% more ships coming
 in than nowadays. There has been a    
 decline of dock workers coming from   
 the village.                          
   { Dredgers}come into the dock about 
 twice every year, though it depends   
 upon the tide. They clear all the     
 sewage and waste material from the    
 dock, leaving it clear for the ships  
 to come in.                           
     The largest ship coming into the  
 dock fills up the whole of the dock   
 length ways and its bow rests on the  
 bank.
