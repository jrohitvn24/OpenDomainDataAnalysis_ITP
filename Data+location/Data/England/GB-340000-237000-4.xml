		<content> The Madley Earth Station was one of   
 the two Communication Centres which   
 linked an estimated one and a half    
 billion people in the largest pop     
 concert the World has ever known. This
 took place on July 14th 1985 and      
 raised 40 million pounds for the      
 Ethiopian Famine. The concerts in     
 England and USA lasted from noon on   
 July 14th to 4am July 15th.           
   It was truly magnificent to see the 
 people of the world unite in this     
 spectacular way. Never before has     
 there been such a 'girdle of          
 compassion' round the Earth. The      
 plight of the starving Ethiopians has 
 stirred the conscience of the world.  
 The response of ordinary people proves
 that goodness and decency can still   
 triumph over fear, hatred and         
 oppression.
