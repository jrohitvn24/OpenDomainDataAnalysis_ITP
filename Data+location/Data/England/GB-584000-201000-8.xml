		<title>08WHITE HOUSE MANOR MUNDON</title>
		<content>{White House Manor}is a 14th century   
 timber framed mansion. It has 21 rooms
 and it has a large fireplace in the   
 living room which is 6 feet 5 inches  
 in width. They heat the house by      
 gas. One person said "It may have     
 been built by a sheep farmer".The     
 present owners have lived here since  
 about 1980.                           
  The house isn't expensive to maintain
 apart from the heating which costs Â£50
 a week.                               
  The back garden is two acres and     
 in it is an orchard. As well as that  
 they have a 5 acre field. In the back 
 garden is a big pond where ducks nest.
   This pond was where the barges      
 turned round when the canal was in    
 use.                                  
  Outside the house there is a large   
 cannon.                               
                                       </content>
