		<content>  {Mr. Russell}has only ten teachers   
 for his 340 pupils, this is not       
 enough! He would like several more,   
 but in the present financial          
 circumstances, he won't get them. It  
 would be particularly beneficial for  
 the{Infant's Reception}classes to be  
 limited to twenty, so that children   
 might at least get a good start.      
   Mr. Russell thought that teachers   
 should be paid more as theirs is such 
 a very responsible job and currently  
 teachers have been left behind in     
 their comparative pay levels.         
   Mr. Russell fears that there are now
 more children who are badly behaved,  
 but most children are still good and  
 work hard! Some people blame tele-    
 vision programmes for bad behaviour;  
 for example, children see kicking and 
 other violence and copy bad examples.
