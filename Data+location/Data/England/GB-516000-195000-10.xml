		<title>10ELSTREE AERODROME</title>
		<content> The aerodrome was at one time the     
 venue for post-war car racing, but is 
 now a very popular airfield for flying
 private light aircraft. A thriving    
 aero club has attracted members from a
 wide area and alongside the runway can
 be found several small businesses     
 concerned with the maintenance and    
 servicing of these aircraft.          
                                       
 Apart from private use, especially    
 that of learning to fly, there are    
 also companies which deal in shipping 
 light freight by air. Additionally    
 Elstree is the base for{Capital       
{Radio's "flying-eye"}which broadcasts 
 news each morning of traffic jams     
 around London. Within the local area, 
 however, the aerodrome is mainly known
 for its regular air displays, and the 
 sight of small, historic aicraft in   
 the skies is a common one.            </content>
