		<title>02THE LIFE OF THE FARM MANAGER</title>
		<content> I am David Baker manager of the farm  
 on Werrington Park Estate.It comprises
 862 acres of which 100 are for cereal,
 15-20 are for rape,20 for maize and   
 the remainder for silage and grazing. 
 My day begins around 7.00am.,when I   
 organise my 7 staff for their duties.I
 then help to check all the stock which
 consists of 400 ewes,1100 store lambs 
 to fatten and 70 beef, reared and sold
 as stores (Â£700-Â£800 per head).Then I 
 attend to office duties and see the   
 dairymen who milk the 240 cows in a   
 new dairy complex built over the past 
 5 years.As I am a working manager I am
 on call for any emergency arising     
 during the day and meals are taken at 
 appropriate times.In Autumn,due to    
 harvest and new born calves,my working
 day is longer.I now'sponge'the sheep  
 this brings them into heat, and after 
 serving they lamb at the same time.   </content>
