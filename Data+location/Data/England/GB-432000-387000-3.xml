		<title>03BUSES IN SHEFFIELD</title>
		<content>   Buses in Sheffield are very         
 frequent. If you miss a bus you do not
 have to wait long for another. The bus
 fares are very cheap compared to other
 cities like Leeds or Manchester.{The  
{children only have to pay 2p and the  
{adults only have to pay 5p or 10p}so  
 that it isn't much. So people in      
 Sheffield can get around the city very
 cheaply.                              
   The buses are mostly double deckers 
 but{the City Clipper}is a single      
 decker which runs in the City Centre  
 and{is free.}The buses are cream and  
 brown. The double deckers hold about  
 74 people: 69 sitting,5 standing. This
 city is very lucky having a free bus. 
 Not many cities have anything like    
 this.
