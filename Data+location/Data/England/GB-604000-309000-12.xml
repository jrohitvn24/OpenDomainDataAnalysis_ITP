		<title>12Interview with Mr.Fisher.</title>
		<content>     Mr.Fisher is the milkman in       
 Mattishall.He gets his milk supplies  
 from Norwich,and his milk-round is to 
 nine hundred houses in two villages,  
 Mattishall and Welborne.He delivers   
 one thousand,five hundred pints of    
 milk per day. Apart from milk he also 
 sells fruit juice,soft drinks,butter, 
 eggs and cream.He used to compete with
 three other milkmen delivering in     
 these two villages,but now he does it 
 on his own.                           
     Mr.Fisher was born in Mattishall  
 and has lived here for almost fifty   
 years.He has seen many changes,chiefly
 the influx of people from outside this
 immediate area and the resulting huge 
 increase in housing and appearance of 
 modern estates. Also,the building of  
 the new Middle School and Health      
 Centre have been major developments.
