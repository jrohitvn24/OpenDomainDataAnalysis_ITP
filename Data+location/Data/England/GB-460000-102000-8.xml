		<title>08EVENTS IN CASTLE STREET</title>
		<content> These include the Pageants of the     
 early 1900's which took place at the  
 castle from time to time.  After the  
 Second World War these were replaced  
 by the Galas which were held every    
 year and these were finally replaced  
 by the annual fetes which are held in 
 mid June during the Flower Festival.  
 Other well-remembered occurances were 
 the floods between 1912 and 1918 which
 left Castle Street under several feet 
 of water.   1935, and Portchester     
 celebrated King George V's Silver     
 Jubilee by planting an oak tree in    
 Castle Street. In 1980 Castle Street  
 was used as a set for a television    
 programme set in the past called      
 "Brenden Chase".  In 1983 a Son et    
 Lumiere was held at the castle which  
 told the history of the monument.
