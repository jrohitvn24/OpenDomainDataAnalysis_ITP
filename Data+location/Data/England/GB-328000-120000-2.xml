		<title>02HATCH BEAUCHAMP BY_PASS</title>
		<content>   The by_pass was started on April    
 16th 1985 and is nearly finished. It  
 will be in use from June 29th onwards.
 It is three miles long. It is designed
 to divert most of the heavy traffic on
 the busy A358, away from Hatch        
 Beauchamp.                            
   Many people are pleased about the   
 new road,although it will mean that   
 people in West Hatch, wishing to go to
 Hatch Beauchamp will have to go down  
 the very narrow Griffin Lane or travel
 along the by_pass for 4_500 metres. It
 will also cause some people to go out 
 of business,for example the Scrumpy   
 Shop and a Filling Station have       
 already closed. The by_pass will      
 completely change the character of the
 village from being noisy to peaceful, 
 we hope! On June 30th there is to be a
 village party at the playing field, to
 celebrate the opening of the by_pass. </content>
