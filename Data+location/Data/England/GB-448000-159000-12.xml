		<title>12Local Opinions</title>
		<content>    Despite the lack of amenities the  
 general opinion of the residents,from 
 teenagers to pensioners,is that the   
 area should retain it's peaceful rural
 atmosphere.As no form of expansion has
 been planned for the forseeable future
 and only infilling is allowed for     
 house building,there is no cause for  
 alarm.                                
    In the opinion of the farmers,life 
 has become more difficult in recent   
 years.The increase in labour costs has
 reduced the number of employees.A farm
 that once supported 3 families now    
 supports one.The{E.E.C farm policies,}
 particularly over milk quotas have    
 caused great bitterness.To quote a    
 lady farmer,"We used to have a small  
 efficient low cost herd,but with the  
 introduction of milk quotas,our quota 
 was too small to make dairy products  
 economically viable."                 </content>
