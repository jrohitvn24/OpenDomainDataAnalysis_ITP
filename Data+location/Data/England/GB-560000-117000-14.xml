		<content> There is no place of worship in       
 Rushlake Green apart from the parish  
 room where services are held in the   
 winter months. Most churchgoers go to 
 St. Mary's, the ancient parish church 
 a mile away. Many attend the major    
 festivals and family weddings,        
 christenings and funerals, but only a 
 small minority are communicants. There
 is a Strict Baptist chapel at Turner's
 Green and Plymouth Brethren meeting   
 house at Three Cups. Roman Catholics  
 have to go to Heathfield 4 miles away 
 to worship. Some young people go to   
 the Welcome Free Church or the even   
 more evangelical 'break-away' congre- 
 gation meeting, both in Heathfield. So
 far the ecumenical movement has made  
 little impact but Anglicans and       
 Methodists do hold a joint service    
 once a month and there are inter-     
 denominational Lent groups.           </content>
