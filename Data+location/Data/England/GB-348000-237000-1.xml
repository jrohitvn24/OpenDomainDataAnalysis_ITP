 population of approx. 45,000.It is the
 centre of a county mainly involved in 
 agriculture.The name "Hereford" means 
 "army ford"                           
   Our block consists of 50% farmland, 
 45% residential with 5% commercial    
 interests. The River Wye, flowing in  
 an easterly direction, bisects the    
 area. It is crossed by four bridges,  
 one obsolete rail(now used as a cycle 
 track),two road (one built circa      
 1500,one modern built 1967) and one   
 footbridge.                           
   A modern ring road follows the line 
 of the old city walls, parts of which 
 are still visible.                    
  Buses provide good service to all    
 regions and there is easy access to   
 the Motorway system.
