		<title>10ADULT LEISURE</title>
		<content> Leisure pursuits consist mainly of    
 gardening,family outings or visits to 
 pubs and clubs.Quite a large number of
 men in the area are keen gardeners and
 many enter local Leek Shows which are 
 common in the north_east.             
 Pubs and clubs are a favourite form of
 entertainment,especially at weekends  
 when husband and wife often go out    
 together for the evening.Live cabaret,
 dancing and bingo are provided by most
 clubs,while the pubs often offer pool 
 as well as darts and dominoes.The most
 popular drink for women is lager while
 most men are beer drinkers.Prices     
 vary,with the clubs being cheaper than
 the pubs.                             
 Many women and some men prefer the    
 bingo halls of Jarrow and South       
 Shields for their entertainment.People
 who enjoy the cinema have to travel to
 areas outside of South Tyneside.      </content>
