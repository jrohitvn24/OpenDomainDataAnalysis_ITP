 this is one of the games we play.It is
 called{"Polo"},this is the way we play
 it.                                   
    A person stands at the front and   
 then there is a person called the     
 messenger.He goes to the person in    
 front and he says to the messenger{   
{"Flowers"}or something else. Then the 
 messenger goes to the three people and
 tells them what it is. The messenger  
 calls to the person in front who calls
 out{"A flower"}and the person who     
 chooses that flower runs and so does  
 the person in front.The one who gets  
 back to his place first shouts out {  
{"Polo"}and he wins.
