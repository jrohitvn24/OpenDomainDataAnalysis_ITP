		<content> With the exception of some of the     
 marshy land to the north of Kemsley   
 Mill all of the region is high grade  
 agricultural land. Twenty years ago   
 half of the area was covered with     
 orchards growing cherries, plums and  
 pears. Our survey showed that all of  
 the cherry orchards had gone and been 
 ploughed up to plant cereal crops or  
 oil seed rape. Where possible fields  
 have been combined to make larger more
 manageable areas and apart from a few 
 fields which were intensively farmed  
 to grow market garden produce, and a  
 few which still had permenant grass,  
 cereals and rape were the only crops. 
 With the exception of the Coldharbour 
 Marshes we saw very few sheep, no cows
 and a few cattle for fattening. Many  
 chemicals are used in farming today   
 and their effect on the health of the 
 population is underestimated.         </content>
