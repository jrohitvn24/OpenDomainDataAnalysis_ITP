		<title>18W.Lough.Disused Railway.</title>
		<content> Behind my house there is a{Disused}   
{Railway Track.}The sleepers and metal 
 rails have been taken away,so it is   
 quite safe to play there.The over     
 hanging trees make tunnels that shed a
 green light.It seems a secretive place
 and is ideal for making dens.My       
 friends and I usually play around an  
 old stone bridge.Sometimes we hide in 
 the greenery and spy on people.       
 The railway track is very well used by
 local dog owners and elderly people   
 taking strolls.Most people think it is
 a very peaceful quiet area but        
 occasionally the silence is shattered 
 by roaring moterbikes using it as a   
 racing track.Perhaps the only person  
 who doesnt mind the noise is{The Ghost
 who haunts the nearby{White House}for 
 she would be used to the rumbling of  
 the trains.                           
                                       </content>
