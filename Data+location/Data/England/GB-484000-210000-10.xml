		<content>    Weston Turville is a very old      
village,but still in 1985 stories of   
the supernatural are about.            
    The Red Lady: a lady who was       
wearing a red dress was walking her dog
up and down Mill Lane,Weston Turville  
when she needed a rest.There was an old
barn called "Mill Barn".She went inside
and sat on a bale of hay.While she was 
resting bales of hay fell on top of her
and she suffocated.Now she still walks 
her dog up and down Mill Lane.         
    Aston Clinton is a very old village
with an old Roman Road running through 
called Akeman Street.Also there is the 
site of the old moat.                  
    Bedgrove being a very recent       
estate has no old sites at all.
