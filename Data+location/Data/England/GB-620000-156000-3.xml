		<content> Also in Littlebourne is a very active 
 United Reform Church served from      
 Canterbury for Communion + by 2 Elders
 who lead the 2 services each Sunday.  
 During the week there is a Womens     
 Pleasant Hour, house groups for Bible 
 study, videos, discussions and prayer.
 For children there are the Beavers and
 Crusaders.                            
 Ickham Church of St John has a        
 shingled spire an interesting tomb +  
 fine organ. Wickhambreux St Andrew has
 a tower + an avenue of pleached lime  
 trees. They share a vicar but have    
 their own choirs, organists + ringers.
 Ickham has two bells, Wickhambreux a  
 peal. Services alternate. Proceeds are
 shared from the Christmas market held 
 at Ickham and the Wickhambreux Summer 
 fair. Soon one vicar will serve all   
 the Parishes and Stodmarsh.
