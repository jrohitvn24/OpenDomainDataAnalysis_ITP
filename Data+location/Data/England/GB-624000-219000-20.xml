		<title>20LIFEBOAT - WALTON</title>
		<content> The Walton life boat is a 15m Solent  
 with a maximum speed of nine knots.   
 The Walton life boat isn't very old   
 as they got a new boat quite          
 recently. The boat has seven crew     
 members and about five launchers and  
 other helpers. The day to day running 
 of each station is left to the local  
 voluntary committee run by an honoray 
 secretary whose duties include the    
 authorization of each life boat       
 launch. Usually the only full time    
 workman of the station is the mechanic
 who deals with all the maintenance of 
 the craft. The life boat is moored    
 about fifty metres from the end of the
 pier. In an emergency the crew members
 would drive to the life boat station  
 (opposite the pier), get their        
 protective clothing and run down the  
 pier. They go down some steps to a    
 small boat.                           </content>
