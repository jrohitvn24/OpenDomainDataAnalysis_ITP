		<title>05MOTORWAYS M27 AND M3, HANTS</title>
		<content> IN THE AREA STUDIED,THERE IS ONE      
 MOTORWAY_THE M27, LINKING BOURNEMOUTH 
 TO PORTSMOUTH VIA SOUTHAMPTON. THE A33
 FROM SOUTHAMPTON TO WINCHESTER IS     
 PLANNED TO BECOME M3. THESE TWO ALSO  
 LINK UP WITH OTHER MAJOR ROUTEWAYS IN 
 THE SOUTH. MUCH LAND HAS BEEN TAKEN UP
 _THE ACTUAL TRAFFIC LANES ARE, ON     
 AVERAGE,23 METRES WIDE. HOWEVER, THE  
 EMBANKMENTS AND BORDERING LAND MAKES  
 UP MORE SUBSTANTIAL AREAS OF LAND THAN
 THIS. IN GRID SQUARE 0441 0117, THE   
 MOTORWAY SEPARATES BUILT UP           
 RESIDENTIAL AREA OF HIGH_CLASS HOUSING
 FROM THE RURAL LOCATION OF CHILWORTH  
 VILLAGE. MANY OF THESE LARGE HOUSES,  
 WHICH WERE ONCE IN A QUIET SECLUDED   
 AREA, NOW FIND THEMSELVES LOOKING OVER
 THE MOTORWAY AND TOLERATING HIGHER    
 NOISE LEVELS.                         
                                       
                                       </content>
