		<title>13ASTONS COACHES.</title>
		<content>   Aston's coach company which is based
 in Kempsey was formed in 1929. Today  
 the company owns 20 coaches and 2     
 double decker buses.                  
   A good deal of the company's work   
 every day takes the form of           
 transporting people from outlying     
 villages to work or school and 10     
 vehicles a day are allocated for this.
  The company also runs day excurisions
 throughout the year to various parts  
 of the country and it is found that   
 these are most popular with elderly   
 people who would not otherwise have   
 the chance to visit these places.     
  Since 1981 the company has been      
 running its own continental holidays  
 and short excursions and these        
 'packages' have proved most popular.  
 One reason for their popularity is    
 that the 1980's has seen improvements 
 in comfort standards in coach travel. </content>
