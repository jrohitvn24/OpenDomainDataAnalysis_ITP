		<content> The{Blacksmith}-Until about 30 years  
 ago there were 2 blacksmiths in the   
 village,now only 1 remains worked by 2
 brothers who are now the fourth       
 generation.In Victorian times it was  
 all forge work,horse shoeing,making   
 and repairing horse-drawn farm        
 implements as well as making the      
 iron-work and re-bonding wheels for   
 carts and wagons.Now the work is      
 mainly elecric and oxy-acetylene      
 welding,repairing farm machinery and  
 implements,making trailers            
 etc..Forging ironwork using a coal    
 fire and blower is still done but on a
 much smaller scale.The blacksmith is  
 essential to the agricultural industry
 but will also make and repair domestic
 articles.
