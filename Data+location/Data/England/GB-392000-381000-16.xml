 Noggin Farm dates back to 1347 and has
 been lived in by the White family for 
 300 years.Mr.White has worked on      
 Noggin Farm for 42 years.The total    
 area of the farm is 28acres.Mr.White  
 owns 56 cows,all Freisans.On average  
 each cow produces 5gallons of milk per
 day.In winter the cattle are fed on   
 cattle corn,sugar beet and hay.In a   
 good year between 20 &amp; 24 calves are  
 born.None of these are sold,the cattle
 are always sold at their lives end.   
 Mr.White has 5 people working for him-
 1 fulltime,1 part-time and 3 part-time
 on the milk rounds.The milk is bottled
 with a 4 valve bottling machine.      
 Mr.White does not think there will be 
 any major changes at Noggin Farm      
 because it is small.
