		<title>10Highfields Farm</title>
		<content> On Highfields Farm there are 1500     
 pigs- 200 sows, 11 boars and 1300     
 piglets. Two men look after all these 
 animals. They change into clean       
 overalls and boots before entering the
 pens so that no diseases are carried  
 to the animals. A vet visits the farm 
 every 3 months. It is not economical  
 to keep a sow with less than 8 piglets
 in a litter. The farmer has a new     
 machine to prevent sows suffocating   
 their piglets. A fan automatically    
 switches on when the sow stands up.   
 Cold air rushes in making the piglets 
 move away. When the sow lies down the 
 fan stops and the piglets return to   
 feed. They are weaned when 21 days    
 old. They eat dry protein-enriched    
 pellets. Sows are mated again 5       
 days after weaning. Pigs reared for   
 pork are sold at 16 weeks, those for  
 bacon at 24 weeks.                    </content>
