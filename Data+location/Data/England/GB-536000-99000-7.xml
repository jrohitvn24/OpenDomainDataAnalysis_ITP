 one building.The school was previously
 sited in peacehaven &amp; called the      
 Peacehaven Cliff Park temporary coun- 
 cil school.The school moved to new    
 premises in April 1938.The reprograph 
 -ics room used to be the kitchen &amp; the
 children ate at their desks.The compu-
 ter room used to be a cloakroom.      
 The middle class rooms had a partition
 which could be pulled back making room
 for an assembly. The horsa hut was    
 built as a canteen for Canadians      
 during the war.The Library was origin-
 ally the kitchen and the other room   
 the dining area. The main building    
 was extended by two class rooms in the
