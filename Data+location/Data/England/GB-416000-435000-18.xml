		<content>   York House has been built for 30    
 years and has had 27 years of         
 vandalism.When it was first built it  
 was nice but vandals sprayed on the   
 walls,windows were smashed and the    
 lift was always out of order.People   
 complained about the lack of          
 security.People could just walk in    
 through any of the 4 entrances.Many   
 people inside the flats were scared   
 and some left.After many complaints   
 the council gave the go ahead and had 
 it cleaned and repainted.This was     
 stopped because of cuts until 3 years 
 ago.                                  
   York House has now been improved a  
 lot.It has been painted in 2 shades of
 brown and white.There is only one     
 entrance with security guards and 4   
 security cameras.A new lift and       
 windows have been installed.
