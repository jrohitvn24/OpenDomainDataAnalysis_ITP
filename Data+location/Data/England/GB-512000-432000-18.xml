		<title>18  Living on Longhill Estate</title>
		<content>   For a long time there were no       
 telephones, and the{bus service}was   
 not very good. Fewer women worked in  
 the 1950's, and Mr and Mrs Glenton had
 more visitors then than now. The      
{houses}were heated by coal. No one had
 gas fires on Longhill Estate.         
   Mr Glenton is 59 and works as a     
 marine engineer. He works at all of   
 the docks in Hull, and has travelled  
 to many parts of the world working on 
 tugs. At home Mr Glenton likes to work
 in his garden. He grows flowers and   
 vegetables. Mrs Glenton looks after   
 the{house.}She likes to listen to     
 records and Viking Radio. They both   
 like watching TV and swimming. They   
 travel to Haltemprice baths in their  
 car.
