		<title>17LOCAL HISTORY</title>
		<content> LIFE WAS LEISURELY. EVERYTHING WAS    
 HORSE-DRAWN. MOST HOUSES HAD EARTH    
 CLOSETS WHICH WERE CLEANED OUT        
 AT INTERVALS BY MEN EMPLOYED BY THE   
 LOCAL COUNCIL. IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE   
 LATE 1920'S THAT STAINDROP HAD        
 ELECTRICITY. BEFORE THAT A RATHER POOR
 GAS SUPPLY PROVIDED A FORM OF         
 LIGHTING. FEW HOUSES HAD PIPED        
 WATER,MOST DEPENDED ON THE MANY PUMPS 
 IN THE VILLAGE. THE RABY ESTATE       
 EMPLOYED MOST OF THE MEN, OTHERS      
 WALKED TO WORK AT NEARBY PITS.        
 AGRICULTURE EMPLOYED MANY MORE MEN    
 THAN NOW, AGAIN HORSES DOING PLOUGHING
 REAPING AND SOWING. WITH SO MANY      
 HORSES, THERE WAS A NEED FOR          
 BLACKSMITHS AND THERE WERE ALWAYS TWO 
 IN THE VILLAGE. NEWSPAPERS WERE       
 BROUGHT BY HORSE AND TRAP FROM WINSTON
 STATION. CATTLE WERE DRIVEN TO BARNARD
