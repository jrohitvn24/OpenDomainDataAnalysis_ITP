		<title>17New Developments.</title>
		<content>  Despite what may appear, at times,   
 as a gloomy picture, there are{ new   
{developments} taking place in Heywood.
 Within the last two years, a large    
 supermarket has opened, and new shops 
 are planned for the centre. We have a 
 fine{Civic  Hall,}which is used by the
 many amateur societies that flourish  
 in the town. The local cricket team   
 are having a very successful time and 
 amateur sport continues to grow.      
  Industrially, there are problems, but
 new industries are developing,        
 particularly warehousing industries.{ 
{The Textile Industry,}though reduced  
 in size, is still a force in the area,
 and continues to lead the way in the  
 development of {new Technology.}      
 Socially, steps are being taken to    
 overcome the problems of unemployment 
 and a rise in drug taking, politically
 the future is somewhat unsure.        </content>
