		<title>05PUBLIC HOUSES IN CUCKFIELD</title>
		<content>  There are 5 public houses located    
 on the main road running through the  
 village. They are:- The Ship, The Rose
 and Crown, The Talbot, The King's     
 Head and The White Hart. In the 18th  
 Century the London to Brighton coach  
 route ran through Cuckfield and many  
 travellers broke their journey        
 spending the night at one of these    
 inns. The most talked about pub in    
 Cuckfield is the New King's Head built
 early 19th Century. The Old King's    
 Head (coaching inn) where George IV   
 once stayed was demolished early 19th 
 Century. Two ghosts are said to haunt 
 the present building. One is known as 
 'The Grey Lady' who haunts one of the 
 bedrooms. The other is known as       
 'Geranium Jane' so called because her 
 jealous lover is meant to have killed 
 her by dropping a well aimed pot of   
 geraniums on her head.                </content>
