		<content> The main form of transport in         
 Tadcaster is a car.One of the most    
 popular types of car is the Ford      
 Escort.The cheaper form of transport  
 is a bike and people who live in      
 Tadcaster and ride their bikes to     
 work.In Tadcaster you will see        
 transport such as a lorry because the 
 people who work at the brewery use    
 lorries to carry casks of beer to     
 other breweries or pubs.At the        
 brewery  there are 2 different kinds  
 of lorries.They are Bedfords which my 
 dad drives,and long vehicles called   
 articulated  lorries which my dads    
 friend drives.Buses are the main      
 public transport in Tadcaster.        
 They travel to Wetherby, York, Leeds, 
 Harrogate and Selby.It costs you Â£1.20
 to go to Leeds and back by bus.A taxi 
 can only take about 4 people in unlike
 the bus which carries 50-60 people.   </content>
