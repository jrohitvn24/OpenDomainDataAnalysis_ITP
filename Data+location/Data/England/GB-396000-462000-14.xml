		<content> Boys and girls like to play{skipping  
 which is a game where a{rope}is       
 used.The{rope}is held at each end and 
 turned.Another person goes to the     
 middle of the{rope}and{jumps}when the 
 rope reaches the floor.               
 Another game is{"Tig".}One person     
 is{"on"}and has to touch someone else 
 who then becomes{"on".}One of my      
 favourite games is{"relievo",}played  
 with three or more people.The{catcher 
 has to try to{catch}everyone before   
 someone else releases them.The{catcher
 has to say{1,2,3}and the persons name 
 to catch someone,for example if it was
 me he had found he had found he would 
 say{1,2,3, Roseann.}If he finds       
 everyone the{first person}caught would
 be on.If nobody is caught the person  
 who was on would be on again.Other    
 games played include,{hopscotch       
{,netball}and{football.                </content>
