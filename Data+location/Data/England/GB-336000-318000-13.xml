		<title>13CHICKEN FARM NEAR NESSCLIFFE</title>
		<content> We went to the chicken farm at        
 Valeswood and saw hundreds and        
 thousands of chicks.  They were fed   
 automatically by a machine that goes  
 round with chick food so they can     
 peck food out of it.  There are lights
 and heaters to keep them warm too.    
 There was water for them.  There were 
 four sheds each big enough to hold    
 25OO chicks.  The chicks come from    
 Craven Arms on the day they hatch.    
 They stay on the farm for 4O days.    
 They grow very fast.  Then they are   
 sent back to Craven Arms where they   
 are killed and frosen.  If the        
 chickens escape or the food stops     
 going round an alarm goes off.  The   
 farm has been there for l8 years,     
 4 people work on the farm which I     
 think is not very many.
