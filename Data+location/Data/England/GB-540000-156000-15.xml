       IVY COTTAGE                     
In 1920 Mr. William Paine helped his   
firm build two bungalows. He liked     
Biggin Hill very much and wanted to    
live there. In 1922 when he was out of 
work he decided to take another look at
Biggin Hill to find work and he        
succeeded. 1927, William Paine says    
that his house is "semi-detached and   
old". The main part has four rooms 2 up
and 2 down.  The walls were four inches
thick. There were probably 2 bedrooms  
upstairs and a kitchen and a lounge    
downstairs. It had an outside toilet.  
The cottages were 80 years old in 1927.
"Ive Cot" was built in 1847. When he   
bought the cottage they were known as  
No.1 and No.2 Ivy Cottages. His cottage
was No.2,it was called "Ivy Cottage"   
but he called it "Ive Cot" for short.
