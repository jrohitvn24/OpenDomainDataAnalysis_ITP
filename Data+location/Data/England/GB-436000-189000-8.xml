 Grove adults are beginning to form    
 their own societies to which Wantage  
 people are welcome. These new         
 activities are aimed at the young     
 parents' needs, like the Grove Theatre
 Group, formed this year as a breakaway
 from The Harlequins of Wantage. They  
 plan to perform Murder Play by Brian  
 Burton and After Margritte by Tom     
 Stoppard, on June 29th. The Grove     
 Horticultural Society meets monthly.  
 The gardens of Grove are beginning to 
 look established and attractive after 
 10-15 years. The Grove Ladies Social  
 Club are going on a Thames Cruise in  
 June to listen to a talk by an Oxfam  
 Outworker. There are also many classes
 held at the Grove Adult Education     
 Centre ranging from sport to language,
 cooking and the arts.
