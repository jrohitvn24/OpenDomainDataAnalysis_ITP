		<content>  Tourist attractions include:         
 Dartington Hall and Gardens           
 Dartington Cider Press Centre         
 The Cott Inn, Dartington              
 River Dart and walks                  
 Totnes-an ancient town with a castle  
 and many craft shops                  
 The beautiful countryside             
                                       
 I think tourists go to Dartington Hall
 and the gardens to see the old        
 buildings and the beautiful trees and 
 bushes. The best part of the year is  
 the summer when people picnic there.  
 The Dartington Cider Press Centre used
 to be a cider press. Now there are    
 lots of shop including a large craft  
 shop, Tridias(toyshop), Dartington    
 Glass, Global Village selling ethnic  
 crafts, a farm food shop, Cranks      
 Wholefood Restaurant and many others. 
 Nearby is the Dartington Tweed Mill.  </content>
