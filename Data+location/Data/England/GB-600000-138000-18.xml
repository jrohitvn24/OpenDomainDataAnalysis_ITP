 The town has a history of welfare,    
 almshouses used to be available in the
 town centre and a well_established    
 "Old Folks Home" is available now.    
 This is{STANHOPE HOUSE}and caters for 
 a large number of needy elderly       
 people. The residents have their own  
 room but share all the other          
 facilities; this is run by the County.
 A "Friends Association" reads,        
 entertains and organises fund_raising 
 events for the Home. Private          
 enterprise runs a similar House at    
 Kingsnorth. The Fairlawn House at{    
{STANHOPE}is used for "difficult"      
 children, either physically           
 handicapped or emotionally disturbed,
