		<title>10THE WOMAN (POEM)</title>
		<content>{There she is again,}woman of 25 with  
   the face of a forty year old.       
 Battling with her three young         
   screaming kids all stuck up in play 
   school dirt.                        
 She drags them along, her face twisted
   with the pain and self sacrifice of 
   bringing up a trio of kids.         
 She lives a dog's life.               
 Doing the housework-seeing the kids   
 off to school-going to work-picking up
 the kids-making the tea-forcing them  
 off to bed......                      
 The same routine day after day, week  
   after week after week, leaving her  
   for bed shattered, dreading the next
   hectic day.                         
 It's not easy since he left.          
 No more of life's little luxuries, not
   knowing where the next meal is      
   coming from.                        
 Impossible children! A hell of a life!</content>
