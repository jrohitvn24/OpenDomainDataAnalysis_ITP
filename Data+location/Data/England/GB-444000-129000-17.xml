		<title>17SUPERNATURAL FOLKLORE</title>
		<content> These are two local{ghost}stories. One
 is of a frightened scout troop and the
 other about a curious phantom tramp - 
 Both are chillers!In the middle of one
 June a scout troop went to Pinstent   
 Camp near a place called the Masts.   
 The troop made a totempole. The next  
 morning they found the totempole had  
 gone.It had completely disappeared.The
 scouts were very disappointed and     
 decided to make a search.One scout was
 left behind. A little way out the     
 scouts heard a terrible scream. They  
 rushed back to camp and found,to their
 amazement, the totempole had          
 reappeared, whilst on the ground was  
 the scout looking dazed and confused. 
    The Sarum Road, close to the golf  
 course, is{haunted}by a tramp who     
 crawls and murmers "Food - any money?"
 As he crawls he seems to bow three    
 times. On the third bow he vanishes!  </content>
