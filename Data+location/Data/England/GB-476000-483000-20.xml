		<content>     The school normally provides      
 education for children within the age 
 groups 7-11.Classes are organised     
 wherever possible on an age basis in  
 mixed ability groups.                 
     The pastoral care of the pupils is
 normally undertaken by the class      
 teacher concerned. Any special needs  
 of boys and girls due to physical or  
 emotional development are the concern 
 of appropriate senior members,male and
 female,of the school staff.           
     Friendly and caring relationships 
 with the children are developed by the
 teachers on the basis of their        
 professional position"in loco         
 parentis"and discipline is normally   
 enforced by sanctions or withdrawal of
 privileges. When any pupil's behaviour
 causes concern,parents are invited to 
 visit the school to discuss problems.
