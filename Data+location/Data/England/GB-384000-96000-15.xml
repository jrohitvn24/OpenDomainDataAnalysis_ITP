		<title>15     The Milkman.</title>
		<content>        He is a Unigate milkman and his
 depot is at Wool. He has to get up    
 very early to deliver the milk.       
 Sometimes I'm still in bed when he    
 comes and I can hear the bottles      
 rattle as he walks up the garden path.
 He has to stop his milk float many    
 times when he is delivering the milk. 
 He sells lots of other things such    
 as,butter,cheese,cream,eggs,bread,    
 potatoes,real fruit juice,different   
 flavoured yoghurts,apple juice,orange 
 juice,coke,lemonade,soda water and    
 ginger beer. You can buy from         
 him,Christmas hampers, turkey,        
 chickens, bacon and ham.              
        In the springtime he was       
 selling bags of peat.                 
        He collects money for a        
 Christmas Club.
