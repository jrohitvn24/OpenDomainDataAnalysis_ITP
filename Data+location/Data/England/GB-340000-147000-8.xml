		<title>08TOURISM IN THE WEDMORE AREA</title>
		<content>    In our area there are two hotels,  
 both in Wedmore, three caravan club   
 and one camping site. There are eight 
 Bed and Breakfast houses, giving a    
 total of 14 places for tourists to    
 stay.                                 
    From the questionaire we discovered
 the most popular tourist attraction in
 the local area is Cheddar Gorge,      
 closely followed by Glastonbury and   
 Wells. Other attractions are Wookey   
 Hole and Axbridge.                    
    For a day outside the area,        
 thirty-five places were recommended.  
 Bath, Bristol and Weston were the most
 popular. The majority of people were  
 not involved in tourism . Most are not
 conscious of the rise in population   
 when tourists arrive.
