		<title>03THE AMENITIES OF CADEBY</title>
		<content> The village has no shops or inns and  
 since the beginning of 1985 has been  
 deprived of its Post Office.          
                                       
 Morning coffee and afternoon tea      
 facilities are available opposite the 
 church at Jasmine Cottage.            
                                       
 Cadeby is serviced by a mobile        
 greengrocer and fishmonger each week. 
 The mobile library visits every       
 fortnight and the Meals on Wheels     
 service calls daily to one of the more
 elderley residents.                   
                                       
 Concern is expressed by the older     
 residents, the oldest of whom is      
 ninety three years of age, who now    
 have to travel into Market Bosworth to
 collect their pensions.  The lack of  
 an adequate bus service poses obvious 
 problems.                             </content>
