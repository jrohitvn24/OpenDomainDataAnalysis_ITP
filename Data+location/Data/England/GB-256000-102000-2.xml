		<content>    The one thing that cements together
 residents of the area is a liking for 
 their environment, whether they have  
 always lived here or whether they have
 come to live here upon marriage or    
 retirement. There is no village, and  
 most people are farmers, earning their
 living from the land.                 
        Apart from two B class roads   
 the area is divided only by a few     
 minor roads and tracks, which gives a 
 feeling of peace and quietness.       
 Despite the lack of facilities and    
 amenities there is a feeling that     
 the area is a good place to live,     
 where one is not always "running for  
 time".Other reasons mentioned for     
 enjoying living here were the         
 friendliness of the people, and a     
 feeling of safety and security.       
 Residents appreciate their good       
 fortune in living here.               </content>
