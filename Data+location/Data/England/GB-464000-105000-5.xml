  A house belonging to Mr. White is on 
 the top of Portsdown Hill. This was   
 originally built in 1882 but in 1967  
 it was rebuilt. It look down on to a  
 beautiful view. In 1900 it was next to
 the George Inn. Apart from a church   
 and a chalk pit, the landscape was    
 rather bare at that time. Before 1900 
 there were horse drawn carts and in   
 1903 trams travelled up the hill along
 to Waterlooville. This tram service   
 stopped in 1935 because of the        
 increased number of motorized         
 vehicles.                             
  In 1967 Portsmouth City Council      
 altered the traffic system, and the   
 house was pulled down and rebuilt.
