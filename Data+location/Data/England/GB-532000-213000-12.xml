		<title>12ST.LEONARD'S CHURCH, BENGEO</title>
		<content> St.Leonard's is a simple{Norman church
 with 3ft thick flint and plaster walls
 and an 18th century red brick porch. A
{medieval wall painting}has been found.
    Services,from Whit Sunday,alternate
 each week between Holy Communion, 8.00
 and Evensong,18.00.In{winter}it is too
 cold for services but a special one is
 held on St.Leonard's day,November 6th.
    In 1985{The Friends of St.Leonard's
{Church}was set up   a) to maintain and
 improve the fabric of the church and  
 b) to pray, especially for people held
 captive for expressing their religious
 or political beliefs.   (St.Leonard is
 the patron saint of prisoners).       
    Their first project is to embroider
{100 kneelers,}to add something of the 
 20th century.Each will cost Â£10,either
 given by the embroiderer or a donator.
 A local furniture shop will cover the 
 kneelers, hopefully by June 1986.     </content>
