		<title>15HOME LIFE KEEPING PETS</title>
		<content>I have a lovely grey and white rabbit  
called Brighteyes. He jumps out of the 
cage when I open it. I love looking    
after him it is lonely without him. I  
had 4 other rabbits but they died in   
the cold weather leaving Brighteyes.   
My friend has 3 animals. Sam the dog is
black. He eats cooked fresh meat with  
gravy and sometimes a chewy stick. She 
also has 2 black and white cats, they  
are brother and sister.  Spindle has   
had kittens, she had 4 but 2 died then 
she had two who survived. Another      
friend has a 2 year old Alsatian he has
dinner at 4pm and then is taken for a  
walk, this friend also has a rabbit    
which eats rabbit mix, and runs in the 
garden.  Another friend also has an    
alsatian called Rebel. He gets told off
for going upstairs and getting into the
neighbours garden. He is in perfect    
health and is big for his age.         </content>
