		<title>08THE BAKERY AT WEST CAMEL.</title>
		<content>                                       
    The bakery was built in 1903 on the
 A303, and later a cottage was built   
 next door for the workers. The bakery 
 has not changed much, but the original
 coke ovens have been changed to       
 oil.They are steam tube ovens and hold
 164 loaves.The baker buys his flour in
 Bristol.It is mostly made from English
 wheat,but some strong Canadian wheat  
 is bought too                         
    The baker starts work at 3.30am to 
 make the bread and cakes he is going  
 to sell that day.On Saturdays he often
 bakes another batch.There is a shop in
 the bakery for passing trade,but most 
 of his customers live in surrounding  
 villages and three vans are used for  
 delivery.                             
    The baker sells bread,mainly white,
 but brown is becoming more            
 popular.He also sells cakes.          </content>
