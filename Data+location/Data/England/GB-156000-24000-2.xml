		<title>02WHEAL PROSPER MINE</title>
		<content>    At Rinsey there is an old mine. Its
 name is Wheal Prosper. Wheal is       
 cornish for mine. There are a few     
 paths branching off from the circle of
 grass where the old engine house now  
 stands. One of them is just a steep   
 slope, another leads to the car park  
 while the other goes along the cliff  
 top. Along this path is the quarry    
 associated with the mine. Just off the
 beach is a rock called Welloe which   
 can only be seen at low tide.         
    Wheal Prosper Mine was used for    
 mining tin and copper. It was built in
 1869 and was restored in 1970 by the  
 National Trust which owns the         
 surrounding land.
