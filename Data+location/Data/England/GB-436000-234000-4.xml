		<title>04THE ROMAN CAMP,TADMARTON</title>
		<content> THE ROMAN CAMP IS HALF ON USHERCOMBE  
 FARM AND HALF ON THE TADMARTON HEATH  
 GOLF COURSE. ALL THAT CAN BE SEEN NOW 
 IS A SEMI- CIRCLE RIDGE WITH WHITE    
 STONES AROUND IT. IT IS BELIEVED THAT 
 ANCIENT BATTLES WERE FOUGHT THERE AS  
 ARROWHEADS AND KNIVES HAVE BEEN FOUND 
 AND THE BATTLE OF WIGGINTON HILL      
 WAS FOUGHT ONLY 2 KM. AWAY. THERE IS  
 A WELL UNDER A HEDGE IN THE FORT. WHEN
 THE FARMER FROM USHERCOMBE FARM WAS   
 PLOUGHING THE AREA,(THEY ARE ONLY     
 ALLOWED TO PLOUGH 2-3 FEET DEEP),THEY 
 FOUND 2 SKELETONS. ONE WAS JUST A     
 SKULL WITH AN ALMOST PERFECT SET OF   
 TEETH (ONLY ONE AT THE VERY FRONT WAS 
 MISSING). THEY WERE TOLD THAT THESE   
 SKELETONS WERE MALES AND HAD BEEN HIT 
 OVER THE HEAD, PROBABLY WHILE DRINKING
 AT THE WELL. PART OF THE CAMP IS UNDER
 THE LOCAL GOLF COURSE AND SO WILL NOT 
 BE ABLE TO BE STUDIED FOR MANY YEARS. </content>
