		<content>   We live in a very modern and        
 industrious world. For some reason    
 we are always wanting to improve.     
   Computers are in the forefront of   
 industry and pushing forward our      
 achievments.                          
   In the 1940's the first computer was
 developed. It was hard to control and 
 maintain, it was clumsy and broke down
 regularly. It was the size of the     
 school hall and yet could only do     
 simple mathematics (sums?).           
   Today we can store the entire       
 volumes of Encyclopedia Britannica on 
 a laser disk. An impressive advance if
 you think about it.                   
   British Telecom is controlled by a  
 vast amount of computer systems. The  
 weather is processed on a huge        
 computer which answers 300 million    
 questions a second - or so they say.
