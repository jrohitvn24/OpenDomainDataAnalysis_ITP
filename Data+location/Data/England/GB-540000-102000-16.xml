		<title>16St.Laurence's Telscombe</title>
		<content>  St.Laurence's stands on high ground  
above the road. It is of small flint   
faced construction having a square     
tower with a clay tile roof.           
  The present church building dates    
from the early 12th century. The Nave, 
Chancel and north Aisles (with rounded 
arches supported by rounded pillars),  
were built during early Norman times.  
The Chapel and tower being added about 
a century later.                       
  The east and north walls were raised 
to their present height and the chapel 
rebuilt in early Victorian times.      
  Above the Chancel arch and eastern   
window are painted murals executed in  
1905.                                  
  Telscombe's Rectors are recorded from
1337. Although the Telscombe Living was
not officially joined with Piddinghoe  
until 1877 the two churches shared a   
rector as early as 1727.               </content>
