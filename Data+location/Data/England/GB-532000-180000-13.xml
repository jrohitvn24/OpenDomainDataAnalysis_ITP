  In our kilometre square which covers 
Aldgate East and parts of Whitechapel  
and Stepney, we have the recently      
completed East London Mosque which     
reflects the largely Muslim character  
of this part of the borough. There are 
several small mosques too.             
                                       
  Aldgate East has always had a mainly 
immigrant population due to its        
proximity to the docks and also        
historically being the area just       
outside the city gate. This is evident 
even now through the variety of non-   
conformist churches still operative    
here, including methodist / baptist    
missions, Salvation Army Citadel and   
Hostel, Jewish Synagogue and the       
German Church and Hostel of St.        
Boniface.
