		<content> There are two mainline railway tracks 
 running through this section of the   
 map. The more southerly of the two    
 lines runs between Tilbury and        
 Shoeburyness. The other is the main   
 commuter line between Fenchurch Street
 in London and southend-on-Sea. It     
 picks up the southern line in Pitsea. 
                                       
 Much of the land on both lines is     
 banked or cut, enabling the train to  
 run above or below ground level,      
 thereby ensuring the minimum          
 disturbance to the people of Bsildon. 
 When the New Town was first built, it 
 was not served by a Railway Station.  
 People had to travel to Laindon       
 Station, or Pitsea if they wanted to  
 travel by train. Basildon station was 
 opened in 1972.
