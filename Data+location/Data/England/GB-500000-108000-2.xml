		<title>02OLD DEER PARK, ARUNDEL</title>
		<content>                                       
 The Park is little more than enclosed 
 Downland. It is used in parts for     
 grazing sheep thus preserving the     
 short turf which was once a prominent 
 feature of the South Downs. Small     
 crops  of maize, swede, etc are grown 
 to provide cover for pheasants. Long  
 stretches of grassland provide gallops
 for the racehorses from the Castle    
 Stables. Bark tracks have also been   
 laid down for the horses. Small rowing
 boats on Swanbourne Lake offer        
 recreation for all ages. Part of the  
 long main valley is used as a rifle   
 range and red flags are flown at      
 various points to warn walkers when   
 shooting is going on. Some logging    
 takes place when mature plantations   
 are felled.
