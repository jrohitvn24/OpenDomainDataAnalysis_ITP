		<title>19Shopping</title>
		<content> We asked fifty people where they did  
 their shopping.                       
 Forty nine people said that they went 
 to Norwich for their shopping because 
 it was cheaper and because there was a
 larger range of goods available. The  
 price of goods seemed to be very      
 important to people.                  
 However thirty one people said that   
 they used the shops in the villages   
 for small things which they had       
 forgotten. Some of the older people   
 depended upon the local shops.
