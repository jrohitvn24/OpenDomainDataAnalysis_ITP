		<title>17LIFE OF SHROTON CHILDREN</title>
		<content>   SHROTON CHILDREN HAVE TO BE UP EARLY
 TO WAIT AT THE POST OFFICE FOR THE    
 SCHOOL BUS TO TAKE THEM TO FONTMELL   
 MAGNA OR SHAFTESBURY AND THEY ARE AWAY
 UNTIL LATE IN THE AFTERNOON. THE FIVE 
 YEAR OLDS IN PARTICULAR FIND IT A LONG
 TIRING DAY.TO OUTSIDERS THESE CHILDREN
 SEEM LUCKY BECAUSE THEY HAVE SPACE AND
 BEAUTIFUL COUNTRYSIDE IN WHICH TO PLAY
 BUT THERE IS NOTHING SPECIFICALLY     
 PROVIDED FOR THEM. THEY WOULD LIKE A  
 PLAYGROUND WITH SWINGS AND SPORTS     
 FACILITIES. TEENAGERS SAY THAT ALL THE
 ACTIVITIES ARE FOR OLDER PEOPLE AND   
 THEY FIND THE VILLAGE DULL. THEY KNOW 
 THERE IS LITTLE CHANCE OF FINDING JOBS
 HERE AND ON MOST EVENINGS A GROUP OF  
 BORED YOUNG PEOPLE CAN BE FOUND IN THE
 BUS SHELTER OPPOSITE THE PUB. THEY    
 SMOKE AND LISTEN TO THE RADIO TO PASS 
 THE TIME. A FEW CHILDREN ARE AWAY AT  
 BOARDING SCHOOL.                      </content>
