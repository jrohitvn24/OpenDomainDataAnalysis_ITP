		<title>07THE REVELS ON THE GREEN</title>
		<content> EVERY YEAR IN JUNE THE REVELS ARE     
 HELD ON CROXLEY GREEN.  THIS CUSTOM   
 HAS GROWN OUT OF THE THREE CHERRY     
 SUNDAYS THAT WERE HELD IN THE SUMMER  
 IN THE YEARS BEFORE THE 2ND WORLD WAR.
 ON CHERRY SUNDAYS LOCAL PEOPLE AND    
 VISITORS USED TO GATHER ON THE GREEN  
 TO PICK CHERRIES FROM THE WILD CHERRY 
 TREES THAT GREW THERE AND TO PICNIC   
 AND PLAY GAMES.GRADUALLY THE CHERRY   
 TREES DISAPPEARED AND JUST BEFORE THE 
 WAR THE IDEA OF THE REVELS WAS        
 INTRODUCED.TODAY THE REVELS BEGINS    
 WITH A PROCESSION ROUND THE VILLAGE OF
 DECORATED FLOATS.MONEY IS COLLECTED   
 ALONG THE PROCESSION ROUTE FOR        
 CHARITIES.AT THE GREEN THERE IS A     
 CENTRAL DISPLAY AREA WHERE THE REVELS 
 QUEEN IS CROWNED. SHE PRESIDES OVER   
 DISPLAYS BY LOCAL ORGANISATIONS. OTHER
 LOCAL GROUPS PROVIDE STALLS AND       
 SIDESHOWS.                            </content>
