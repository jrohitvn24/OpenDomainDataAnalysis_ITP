		<title>13A Day in the Life...a Mum</title>
		<content> have set jobs to do on particular     
 days.I work for two hours each morning
 and get home shortly after eleven     
 o'clock.                              
  When I get home I start my housework.
 I mostly start by washing the clothes.
 I fill the washing machine,and set it 
 going.While the clothes are being     
 washed,I get on with other jobs like  
 wiping down the worktops and cleaning 
 the bathroom.By this time it is       
 getting on for half past twelve,so I  
 have a bite of lunch and a cup of     
 coffee.                               
  When I have had my lunch,I wash the  
 pots and then I clean and tidy        
 upstairs.My last job is to clean and  
 tidy the front room.                  
  I then like to have half an hour     
 knitting,or reading,or in the garden, 
 depending on the weather,before Paul  
 comes home from school.               </content>
