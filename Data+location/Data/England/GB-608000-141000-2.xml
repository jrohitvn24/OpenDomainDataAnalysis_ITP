		<title>02ST.MARY'S CHURCH,BRABOURNE</title>
		<content>   St.Mary's church at Brabourne is a  
 Norman church,and there is much of    
 interest there.                       
  The church is built mainly of local  
 flint and is heavily buttressed.It is 
 said that the church was beginning to 
 lean over to one side,hence the       
 buttresses and the south chapel and   
 aisle.                                
   A family very much remembered in    
 St.Mary's church,is the Scot          
 family,who have several memorials to  
 their ancestors,the altar being the   
 most obvious example.There are others 
 however,including some brasses on the 
 floor of the chapel,and a heart shrine
 in the chancel.                       
   St.Mary's is very well known for one
 of it's stained-glass windows which is
 recorded as being the oldest          
 stained-glass window in Britain in its
 original position.                    </content>
