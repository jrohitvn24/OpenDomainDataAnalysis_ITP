 mile from the town centre.Parts of the
 buildings orriginate from the{        
{fifteenth century.}There are three    
 schools in all,lower,middle and       
 upper.Pupils have to be over eight    
 years old to board there,you are      
 allowed to board for four days a week.
  In  the summer term there is an open 
 day in which parents can see the work 
 done during the year.                 
  This school is private meaning       
 parents would have to pay for every   
 term spent there.
