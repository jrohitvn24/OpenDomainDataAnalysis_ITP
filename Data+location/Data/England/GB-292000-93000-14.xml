		<content> Breakfast Survey at Ladysmith First   
 School.                               
 On 11th June, 1985, 432 children, aged
 between 5 and 8 years, were asked what
 they had to eat and drink before      
 coming to school. Very few children   
 had anything cooked(bacon, egg or     
 sausage.). A similar percentage (7.8%)
 had porridge. One child had soup.     
 Cereal was very popular. Often two or 
 more varieties were mixed. Weetabix   
 was the most popular. Many children   
 also had more than one drink;often a  
 hot and cold drink. The most popular  
 drink was tea, drunk by 127 children  
 (29%). 125 children had cold milk,    
 often with cereal. Excluding cold     
 milk, hot and cold drinks were equally
 popular. The favorite cold drink after
 milk was orange juice(55 children).   
 With the children white bread was     
 more popular for toast than brown.    </content>
