		<title>09INTERVIEW-SUPERINTENDANT</title>
		<content>Superintendant Embley belongs to       
Whitley Bay police station.His job is  
like a manager's and the men under him 
patrol our surveyed area.              
A policeman in 1985 has to be aware of 
the policing needs in his area.In      
effect he is just a servant to the     
people of Whitley Bay as the police    
force are much more accountable to the 
public nowadays.                       
The Superintendant's job is different  
to the job of policemen on the beat.He 
works from 8:30am to 5:30pm at his     
desk,tied up with paperwork.He is      
also on call 24 hours a day.           
Policing has changed over the years due
the readily available technology       
eg computers.Cars and more             
sophisticated vehicles make the        
policeman of today more mobile.Radios  
are an essential part of the           
policeman's uniform.                   </content>
