		<title>14ANOTHER FAMILY WEEKEND</title>
		<content>My name is Caroline Mills.Ilive near   
the school at Lower Church Farmhouse.On
Saturdays we usually go to Bury to do  
some food shopping.  When I get home I 
help mum to do the cooking.Sometimes my
brother Nick helps mum too, but he     
makes a terrible mess and leaves mum to
clear up.We sometimes go out to see our
Nanny or Grandad.At Nanny's we have    
lunch and she always cooks our         
favourite lunch of pasties and sago    
pudding.In my spare time I usually have
my best friend over.Her name is        
Katherine Greener.She and I play games 
like leap-frog,hide and seek,"it"and   
forty-forty.All these games we play in 
the garden but we also play other games
that we have made up ourselves.In the  
evening Katherine goes home. Then I    
have my supper.After supper,I get ready
for bed,clean my teeth and go to bed.
