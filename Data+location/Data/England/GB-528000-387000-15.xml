		<title>15ROADS THROUGH S.ELKINGTON</title>
		<content>                                       
 The intended route for the urgent     
 Louth by_pass,over farm land at the   
 east of the S.Elkington area, is being
 surveyed at present There are two main
 roads,the A147 from Lincoln and the   
 A631 from Gainsborough and the        
 Midlands. They carry coastal traffic  
 in summer,and lorries daily, some     
 transporting goods produced in Louth. 
 The A631 is a route for airmen working
 at RAF Binbrook.One minor road links  
 S.Elkington with Welton-le-Wold       
 village.Other roads are tarmaced farm 
 tracks,some gated and with cattle     
 grids.                                
 An old carriage way from the Lincoln  
 road to Elkington Hall has almost     
 disappeared,but one whale-bone jaw    
 marks where the gates were hung.
