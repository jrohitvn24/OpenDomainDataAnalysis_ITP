		<content> In our area all the usual methods of  
 sending a message are available. There
 is a Post Office in Frampton Mansell  
 and one in Sapperton. There is a Post 
 Box in Far Oakridge. The mail is      
 collected twice each day, once in the 
 morning and once in the afternoon from
 the Post Offices and Boxes.Most houses
 have a telephone and there is a Public
 Telephone Box in Frampton Mansell.    
 There are two other methods of        
 informing villagers of local events   
 and interesting bits of news.Posters  
 can be displayed in Bus Shelters and  
 in the shop and on Notice Boards near 
 the Church gate.There is a Newsheet   
 for the villagers of Frampton Mansell 
 and Sapperton and in Far Oakridge     
 there is a magazine called What's On  
 which is produced by three            
 volunteers.But most news is passed on 
 when people chat to each other!       </content>
