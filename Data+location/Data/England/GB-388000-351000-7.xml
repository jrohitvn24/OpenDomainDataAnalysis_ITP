		<content>    Near  Ball Green is  the Chatterley
Whitfield mining museum which is  very 
popular with lots of interesting things
to see related to the history of coal  
mining.                                
   The Drift Gallery shows mining from 
the first mines to today, using models 
and machines, to give a clear and      
exciting picture of life in the mines. 
   The Steam Winding Engine which once 
carried coal and miners up and down the
shaft is massive the size and shape are
amazing. It may be working by 1985.    
   But the most exciting part is going 
underground in the mine, with  helmet  
and light,a battery belted around you. 
The shaft goes down a dizzy 717 feet.  
But do not panic because once there a  
guide will show you round the mine     
workings and describe how coal used to 
be mined there. Altogether a unique    
and educational experiance.            </content>
