		<title>01TRENT VALLEY CLIFTON/BEESTON</title>
		<content>   The area as a whole is very varied  
 and has many interesting features.The 
 river{Trent}more or less divides the  
 block into two separate areas.        
    North of the river the{Beeston}and}
{Attenborough}district is a blend of   
 town and countryside including in it's
 facilities a major telecommunications 
 factory ,sports fields,a large nature 
 reserve,grazing land and residential  
 areas.                                
  South of the river again a blend of  
 town and countryside with perhaps the 
{Clifton}housing estate being the most 
 dominant area. Over the last 34 years 
 8,900 dwellings have been built       
 housing a population of 30,000        
 people.This provides a marked contrast
 to the quaint and historic{Clifton    
 Village.                              
  Other features include Trent         
 Polytechnic and Fairham College.      </content>
