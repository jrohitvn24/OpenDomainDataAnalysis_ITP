		<content> Although Havant gives the impression  
 of affluence,there are many problems. 
 Unemployment,particularly of young    
 people,is increasing.In Leigh Park    
 many public areas are subjected to    
 vandalism,costing thousands of pounds 
 to repair.Drug Abuse is increasing,   
 with Heroin-addiction a major problem.
 Solvent abuse is popular among small  
 groups of adolescents.Child-abuse     
 statistics show that Leigh Park has   
 the worst record in Hampshire.        
 The breakdown of marriages is becoming
 common,with resulting social problems.
 Several parts of Leigh Park suffer    
 from housing problems,particularly in 
 early system-built units,where damp   
 rots the fabric.                      
 Self-help organisations have grown in 
 the area,based at Point Seven and     
 Focus 230.
