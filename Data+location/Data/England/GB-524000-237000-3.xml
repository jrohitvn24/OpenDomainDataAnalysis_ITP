		<content> Ashwell has ben officially designated 
 as a {conservation area.}The local    
 council wants to keep the village     
 looking like it does today. In 1985 it
 carried out a{Local Plan}consultation 
 so that villagers had a say in future 
 planning. Strict controls are         
 applied to any new development. New   
 works must{blend in}with the existing 
 architecture and not disturb the      
 conservation area. Ashwell residents  
 strongly support this policy.         
 There are signs that the conservation 
 policy is working. Recent new         
 developments, like Silverlees, have   
 been architecturally sympathetic and  
 the disused{Dixie's Farm}buildings    
 have found new uses as shops or light 
 engineering units. Open space has not 
 been lost and infill housing has been 
 well controlled.                      
                                       </content>
