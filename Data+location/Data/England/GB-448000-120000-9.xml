		<content> The western boundary of the block cuts
 through the village leaving the       
 greater part to the west.This western 
 part consists mainly of modern(post   
 1960s)estates of private housing with 
 some Local Authority development.     
 To the east of the boundary the       
 settlement has developed along the    
 Winchester-Portsmouth road.Here are   
 found some of the older houses in the 
 village,although most are of post 1900
 age.A somewhat incongruous feature is 
 the presence of two mobile-home parks 
 adjacent to the main road.Both have   
 been laid out in disused sand-and     
 clay-pits.                            
 In the south the small hamlet of      
 Fishers Pond extends along Hensting   
 Lane.Here the dwellings are in rather 
 more spacious grounds,some backing on 
 to the lake.                          
                                       </content>
