		<title>13THE HEDGEROW.</title>
		<content>  There are lots of hedgerows in the   
 villages so we decided to try and find
 the oldest. We had to measure and mark
 out a 35 metre length of the hedge and
 count all the different species of    
 bush or tree.                         
  In{Fittleton}we found a hedge that   
 had the following species;{beech,     
{hawthorn, hazel, elderberry and ivy}so
 we believe it must be about{500 years 
{old.                                  
  There were also lots of wild flowers 
 and plants growing in the hedge too.  
 Cowparsley, violets, wild crocus,     
 periwinkle, herb robert, bird's eye,  
 pink and white dead nettle, daisies,  
 dandelions, grasses, nettles, docks,  
 and ferns.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
