		<title>11DAGLINGWORTH QUARRY CONT.</title>
		<content>  It has power steering and could      
 travel at 40 M.P.H unladen. A loading 
 shovel is a kind of digger only much  
 bigger. It has a steel catterpiller   
 track instead of wheels, these give a 
 much better grip. The loading shovels 
 load the dumper trucks with rocks.    
  The Manager of Kingston Minerals     
 is Mr. Smith, he has 11 men working   
 under him. They wear protective       
 clothes including steel caps on their 
 boots and a hard helmet.              
  When the quarry is exhausted a       
 massive hole will remain. This will be
 used as a council rubbish tip until it
 is filled up.
