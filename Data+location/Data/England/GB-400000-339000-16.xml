		<title>16Our Survey of Tean</title>
		<content>In our questioning of 200 people we    
found that most people in Tean now live
in the new housing estates which have  
been built around the village in the   
last 20 years. Most people like the    
area for its friendliness, fresh air   
and country views.Some concern was     
expressed about untidiness and traffic 
noise,but without exception the biggest
recent improvement is the by-passing of
the village(Feb.1985).The greatest     
complaints were about the lack of      
facilities for youngsters both socially
and economically.There was concern     
about the limited shopping in the area,
most people going elsewhere to shop.   
Opinion was divided about public       
transport,some thought it adequate but 
others did not,although the majority   
of people travelled by car.
