		<content> The time is 9a.m.,Matthew and I say   
 goodbye to mum,get our bikes out and  
 cycle to school.We got there at       
 9:10a.m. I hang my bag and coat up in 
 the cloakroom.The bell rings for      
 school to start at 9:15a.m. Our       
 teacher marks the register and a girl 
 gives out some hymn books.We join the 
 infants in their classroom for our    
 service,it is the first and second    
 year juniors' turn to take service.It 
 is about our pets one girl brought her
 rabbit to show us.                    
 After service we have spelling and    
 tables tests.We did hand writing      
 practice and English work until       
 playtime at 10:35a.m. I play rounders 
 with my friends until the bell rings  
 for the end of playtime at 10:55a.m.  
 Back in our classroom we have a Maths 
 lesson and our teacher reads us a     
 story.                                </content>
