		<content>      Education in Marden goes back    
 nearly 400 years. Jane Shelley, whose 
 husband lost his life for taking part 
 in a plot against Queen Elizabeth     
 1st. left provision for a school for  
 the boys of Marden and Sutton. It was 
 founded in 1609.                      
                                       
      The present school was opened in 
 1874. The School Board paid Â£112 for  
 the land and Â£1,478 for the building. 
 At present there is a scheme for      
 remodelling or rebuilding the school  
 and we are sure that the local        
 Education Authority would like a      
 return to the costings of 111 years   
 ago.
