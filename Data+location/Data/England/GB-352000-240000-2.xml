		<title>02HOUSING IN HEREFORD CITY</title>
		<content>    Four distinct types of housing     
 occur in the City of Hereford.        
                                       
   The earliest are very large. Few    
 remain as family homes. Many have been
 subdivided, converted to hotels or    
 nursing homes or acquired as annexes  
 to schools and colleges.              
                                       
    The second category are those large
 semi-detatched houses, erected between
 the wars along the main routes to the 
 city.They are mainly owner occupied.  
                                       
    The council houses erected at very 
 high density during the 1960's and    
 70's account for the third category.  
                                       
    The fourth category includes those 
 low density houses erected during the 
 1980's. They are owner occupied and of
 individual architecture.              </content>
