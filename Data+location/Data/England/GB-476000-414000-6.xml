		<title>06THE WARPINGS.</title>
		<content>      There is a large track of land   
 which extends into our area from the  
 South, called{'THE WARPINGS'}. This   
 name is derived from the old practice 
 of{"warping"}the land. This was done  
 by periodically opening the floodgates
 on the dykes and flooding the land.   
 The floodwaters were then left for a  
 length of weeks until the sediments   
 had settled and thus enriched the     
 land. The process physically{"warped" 
 the land, hence the term{WARPING.}This
 process also encouraged peat to form. 
      In the year{1801}an{Act of       
{Parliament}controlled the operation of
{Warping}and placed certain obligations
 on the landowners rights to "warp".   
      Warping has not been carried out 
 in this area now for many years. But  
 there are still people of more than 70
 yrs. who remember skating on frozen   
 floodwaters around the Warpings.      </content>
