		<title>20Community care in Thurlow</title>
		<content> Thurlow is a typical estate village   
 with a strong feudal feeling in its   
 best interpretation. The owner extends
 a benevolent stewardship covering many
 aspects of the residents' lives. He   
 ensures that roads are snow ploughed  
 in winter, takes steps to protect the 
 ecology, maintains old buildings of   
 special interest, helped to fund the  
 building of the sports pavillion,     
 resurfaced the tennis courts,         
 maintains the sports ground and helps 
 to care for tehupkeep of the church.  
 The estate is the single biggest      
 employer in the village, retaining a  
 benevolent interest in its retired    
 workers. Estate life affects          
 villagers' free time, some acting as  
 beaters during the winter shoots and  
 large numbers supporting the hunt(of  
 which the owner and his wife are joint
 masters)following on horseback,car etc</content>
