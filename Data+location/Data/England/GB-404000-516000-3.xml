		<title>03THE TEES AND FLATTS WOODS</title>
		<content> Once the Durham-Yorkshire boundary,the
 River Tees is in its middle tract.    
 Salmon came up the river till 1930.   
 Crayfish in the river show the water  
 is pure. The river is fished for brown
 trout. Two years ago,creosote from a  
 quarry poured down the river.Fish     
 jumped from the water in agony and    
 died.The river was flushed and        
 restocked.Before the building of Cow  
 Green Reservoir a huge roll flooded   
 the river after rain in the hills.The 
 woods by the river are the remnants of
 the Marwood Chase hunting forest.Lord 
 Barnard (Raby Estates) owns some of   
 Flatts Wood,and Durham County Council 
 the rest.Raby have recently felled    
 part of the woods and are replanting  
 with oak and beech. Other areas       
 replanted about 20 years ago are larch
 ,oak and beech.Deer, squirrels and    
 other animals live in the woods.{     </content>
