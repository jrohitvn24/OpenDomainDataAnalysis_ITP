		<content>The Leaver's ceremony represents the   
last gathering of the 5th yeart pupils 
at the secondary school. Over the years
it has become a tradition of the school
and is much looked forward to by the   
pupils, who spend much time (and money)
on their appearance. Parents and       
friends gather in the school hall at   
about 9.30 and have a short school type
assembly. Afterwards certificates are  
presented by a school governor to show 
that the pupils have completed their   
course at the school, when this is     
finished parents, friends and pupils   
are invited to have refreshements in a 
Very friendly, social atmosphere.      
To keep a record of this event pupils  
and parents take photographs of their  
friends and sign the envelopes in which
they keep their certificates.
