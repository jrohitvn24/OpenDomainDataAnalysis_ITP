		<content>{ Fairham Community College}serves the 
 whole of the community in many        
 different aspects.For parents it      
 offers the chance to catch up their   
 education by taking night school or   
 even day classes with older           
 students(6th Form).                   
  For the elderly there is a day centre
 where they are brought by a community 
 services bus.Whilst they are          
 there,they are provided with meals and
  it also gives them a chance to talk  
 to someone;children from the college  
 also come in and give a hand.         
{ The Peacock Theatre}is a part of the 
 college and stages all productions and
 some other activities,there is also a 
{creche}for the young while mothers    
 go to work or do the shopping.        
  Let us not forget that it is still a 
 school and caters for 11-18 year olds.
