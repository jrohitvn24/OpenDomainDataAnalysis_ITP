		<content> We went to{Hatchford Brook}.It stank. 
 The water was quite clear and running 
 fast. We saw patches of oil. There    
 were rushes,irises and lots of water  
 weeds. There were also                
 sticklebacks,leeches,water            
 snails,catfish and stone loaches.{Low 
{Brook}flows into{Hatchford Brook}and  
 was clearer. We found two frogs. We   
 saw trolleys,keys,tyres,a wheel       
 chair,a lawn mower,an umbrella,glass  
 bottles and cans. We followed{        
{Hatchford Brook}to{Meriden Lake}and on
 to the{River Cole.}By{Meriden Lake}we 
 saw rushes,irises,willows and alder   
 trees. There were some mallards,a     
 coot,white ducks,two swans with four  
 cygnets and some doves. The water was 
 dark and smelly. The{River Cole}was   
 wider,deeper and much faster. We      
 didn't see any fish there, only weed.
