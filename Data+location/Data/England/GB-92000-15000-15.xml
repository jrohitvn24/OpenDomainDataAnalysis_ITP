		<title>15FISHING ON ST.MARTINS I.O.S.</title>
		<content>    In the summer of 1985 there are 7  
 boats fishing from St.Martins,plus    
 four part timers.Only 2 of the 7 are  
 Scillonian registered.The fishing code
 for Scillonian boats is "SC".The rest 
 of the 7 are registered somewhere in  
 Cornwall.Most inshore boats go out    
 about 7 miles to do fishing,they tend 
 to go for hake and monkfish.Some      
 fishermen catch lobsters,crabs and    
 crayfish with pots which are really   
 traps.Damaged fish are placed into the
 pot to lure the crustaceans.Most fish 
 are marketed through Lady Hamilton    
 Fisheries and are sold on the         
 continent.They are transported to the 
 mainland on the ferry Scillonian      
 111.Fish are packed in ice,and the    
 crustaceans are kept in water tanks to
 keep them alive because once they die 
 they go bad very quickly.
