		<title>15A day in the life of a child</title>
		<content> At about 7am I get up and breakfast   
 with the family at 8am. I pack my bag 
 for school. The rest of the children  
 from down the road come to our house  
 and Mom takes us all to school. The   
 doors are usually locked but at 8.50  
 the caretaker opens them. We hang our 
 coats and bags up. I take my reading  
 book and spelling book into the       
 classroom. I write my 4 spellings down
 off the blackboard while Mrs Watson   
 takes the register. Then the whole    
 school goes in for assembly. We have a
 hymn, a story and a prayer. Next we   
 usually have a maths lesson, then     
 playtime followed by SRA. We watch a  
 television programme and have lunch.  
 We have games, playtime and a story   
 before going home.I change into some  
 different clothes and play outside. I 
 have tea then play out again. At 8.30 
 I go to bed.                          </content>
