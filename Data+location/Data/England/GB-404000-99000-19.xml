		<title>19ECOLOGY FERNDOWN HEATH</title>
		<content> On the{heath}beside our school, I have
 looked under rocks and stones and     
 found{slowworms.}The male has a black 
 line along its back but both male and 
 female have a variety of patterns.    
 Mature worms are about 30 cm long and 
 babies about 10 cm. They are born     
 singly. Slowworms feed morning and    
 evening on earthworms, small slugs and
 other insects. They are sometimes     
 mistaken for snakes but are actually a
 type of lizard. Their enemies are     
 cats, dogs, birds and MAN. They are   
 able to grow another tail if          
 necessary.                            
 There are two{ponds}on the heath. We  
 visit them as part of our Science work
 and see many kinds of pond life. If we
 take any animals out of the pond to   
 look at them through a magnifying     
 glass, we must remember to put them   
 back without harming them.            </content>
