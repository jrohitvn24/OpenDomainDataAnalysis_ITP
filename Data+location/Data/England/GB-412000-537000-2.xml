{In 1845 the Weardale Iron Co. started 
{an iron-works, and four collieries    
{were sunk nearby within 6 years. By   
{1860 the population had risen from    
{under 200 to over 3,000 and 2 more    
{collieries had begun work.}The railway
 linked Tow Law with many local towns  
 and though the iron-works and some    
 pits had closed down by 1890, the     
 population was then nearly 4,400.     
{By 1930 all the remaining pits had    
{closed; Tow Law's heyday was over!    
 A small steel foundry was opened in   
 1941 but within 14 years the railway  
 had also closed leaving Tow Law with  
 it's only remaining asset; the cattle 
 mart which had opened in 1882. New    
 homes were built to replace the old   
 pit-cottages but because of the lack  
 of jobs people continued to leave. The
 present population is about 2,200.    </content>
