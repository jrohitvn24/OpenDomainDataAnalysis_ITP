		<title>19A TRAFFIC SURVEY</title>
		<content>  We surveyed the traffic at the mini_ 
 roundabout in Laleham.This roundabout 
 has three roads converging on it.One  
 going to Staines,one goes to          
 Shepperton and the third goes to      
 Ashford.                              
  We were able to make the following   
 observations.In the morning most of   
 the traffic was going towards Staines,
 probably for people to work or shop.  
 In the afternoon most of the traffic  
 was making the return journey away    
 from Staines.The bus service is very  
 limited;we saw only one bus in our 30 
 minute survey.There were very few     
 cyclists probably because they prefer 
 to use the quieter roads along by the 
 river.Most of the traffic was cars but
 there were also vans,lorries and a few
 bicycles.There were hardly any        
 pedestrians.                          
                                       </content>
