		<title>15Lack of open space in Stoke</title>
		<content>Some parents came into school one      
afternoon to talk to us about living in
Stoke.One question we asked them was,  
"Do you think there are enough open    
spaces?"Most of the mums had young     
children and they told us that they    
would like more space for the children 
to play on.They said that it was not   
safe for the children to play near the 
roads.                                 
  We said that we would like more space
because it is difficult to play        
football in the street.There is a small
piece of wasteland by the adventure    
playground but dogs foul it and there  
is often broken glass on it.           
Throughout the area studied by the     
three schools,it became clear that     
there were small areas available for   
the children to play on.However many of
these were overgrown and not fenced off
from the road or littered and fouled.  </content>
