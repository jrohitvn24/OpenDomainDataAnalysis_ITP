		<title>09LIFE IN 85 QUESTIONNAIRE</title>
		<content>Parents were asked for their views on  
Life in 1985.They see violence as      
Society's greatest problem with        
aggressive behaviour,hooliganism,      
mugging and vandalism spoiling people's
lives.The causes are probably lack of  
parental control,general lack of       
discipline,disrespect for law,order &amp;  
authority,&amp; frustration at long-term   
unemployment.The possibility of        
unemployment after leaving school gives
youngsters less incentive to work hard 
at school.Moral standards are declining
manners are worsening &amp; people are     
becoming more materialistic.There seems
to be a greater interest in personal   
financial gain &amp; assets,than in other  
peoples feelings.Public &amp; community    
sprit,friendliness &amp; sociability are   
fast disappearing.Marriages are        
breaking down because of selfishness   
&amp; little thought for the children.     </content>
