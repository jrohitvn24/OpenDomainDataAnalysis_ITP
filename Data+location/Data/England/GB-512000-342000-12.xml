 The land-use in the area is almost    
 exclusively arable in character with  
 the main crops being                  
 cereals,potatoes,sugar beet,peas and  
 oil seed rape. Due to the high quality
 of the land up to three crops of      
 vegetables a year may be harvested.   
 Although very limited some intensive  
 animal rearing does take place        
 particularly chickens and             
 pigs.Irrigation is widely used where  
 potatoes are grown and many farmers   
 have constructed water storage        
 reservoirs.During the construction of 
 the by-pass  supplies of the blue lias
 clay were required and the subsequent 
 depressions were used  as  reservoirs.
