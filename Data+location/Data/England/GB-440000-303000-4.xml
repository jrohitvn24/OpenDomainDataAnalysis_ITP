		<content>   We took some questions about        
 employment &amp; unemployment and asked 20
 people about their employment,and we  
 found that 13 of the people were      
 unemployed while 7 were employed.We   
 asked people if they thought that     
 employment had changed over the years 
 and many said that things had changed 
 for the worst since the Tories came   
 into power.Ten out of thirteen        
 employed people were not in a trades  
 union.The Employment Centre told us   
 that on{9/5/85 }1,974 men and 1,263   
 women were unemployed in the Hinckley 
 &amp; Bosworth region.
