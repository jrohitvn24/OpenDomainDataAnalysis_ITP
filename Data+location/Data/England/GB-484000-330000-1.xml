		<title>01DENTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content>{Denton }is a picturesque village set  
 in agricultural land. It was a        
 thriving village based on open cast   
 iron stone mining in the nineteenth   
 and early twentieth centuries. The    
 mining has now been discontinued but  
 evidence can still be seen in the     
 surrounding countryside.There are     
 low lying fields where the iron stone 
 was removed. The top soil has been    
 restored,however,and crops and grass  
 now grow on the fertile land.         
 Many of the houses are built of iron  
 stone giving them an attractive       
 yellowish colour. Most of the village 
 was owned by the Welby family. Sir    
 Bruno Welby and his family still live 
 in Denton Manor. Many of the older    
 houses have now been sold to private  
 owners who have restored and          
 modernised them inside while retaining
 the original outside appearance.      </content>
