		<content>{The River-keeper}looks after the river
 so that it is the best habitat for    
 trout.The stretch of{the River Wylye  
 he cares for is fished for{brown trout
 by a syndicate of fourteen rods.      
 The trout season lasts from the 15th  
 of April until the 15th of October.   
  The River-keeper has records of      
 all the fish taken from the river,    
 usually between 500-600 trout a year. 
  The river is not restocked, all the  
 fish in the river are wild and have   
 bred naturally. The nearby trout farm 
 stocks Canadian rainbow trout and     
 these develop twice as fast as the    
 native  brown trout. If rainbow trout 
 escape they would drive away the      
 native trout and so they must be      
 regarded as vermin and taken out of   
 the river.                            
  This is a very beautiful stretch of  
 the river to spend a working life.    </content>
