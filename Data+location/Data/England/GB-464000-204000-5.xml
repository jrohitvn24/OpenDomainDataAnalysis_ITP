		<title>05Ghosts at Rycote Chapel</title>
		<content>   Rycote Chapel is a medieval chapel, 
currently maintained by the Department 
of the Environment. In it's more recent
history it has been revisited by some  
of those involved in the chapel's      
illustrious past!                      
   At about 6 o'clock on December 16th 
1973, Mr Morris,the custodian of the   
chapel at the time,saw a lady in       
shining grey.He thought it was someone 
in fancy dress or perhaps someone being
filmed for television.He went to       
investigate and saw her walk straight  
into his office and out of the other   
side,he also realised that HE had      
walked straight through this unusual   
figure.He tried to follow her but round
the next corner she flickered and      
vanished.One theory is that this was   
the ghost of Lady Cecily Heron,daughter
of Thomas More.Another ghost recently  
reported was that of The Milk Maid.    </content>
