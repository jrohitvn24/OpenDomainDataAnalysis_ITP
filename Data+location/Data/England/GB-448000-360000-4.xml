		<title>04Vicki - a typical morning.</title>
		<content> Every morning I get up and I get      
 dressed in my uniform which is a set  
 of clothes that I wear for my         
 school.I then go into the bathroom    
 which is a room that has got a sink   
 which is white and used for putting   
 water in it and you have a wash. We   
 also have a bath which is bigger than 
 the sink, which we can wash our whole 
 body in. After I have washed I go     
 downstairs and have my breakfast which
 is usually milk, cereals and a drink  
 of tea. I then go back to the bathroom
 and clean my teeth. After that I make 
 sure I have everything I need in my   
 school bag and walk to school.        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
