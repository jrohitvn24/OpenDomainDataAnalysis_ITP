		<title>20OPEN SPACES, REIGATE/REDHILL</title>
		<content>    We are lucky to have lots of open  
 spaces. To the north are Reigate Hill,
 Queen's Park &amp; Colley Hill, owned by  
 the{Borough Council &amp; the National    
{Trust.} Pilgrim's Way, with splendid  
 views, runs along the North Downs.    
    In the south west of the block is  
{Reigate Heath}- woods, heathland, golf
 course &amp; a windmill (now a church).   
   {Castle Grounds,}behind Reigate's   
 High St, include the site of the old  
 castle, some lovely gardens &amp; the     
 Baron's Cave. {Priory Park}in Bell St,
 Reigate, has a lake, playing fields,  
 swings &amp; slides.                      
    On{Wray Common,}Redhill, there is a
 windmill. {Redhill Common}has fine    
 views to the South Downs. Some of this
 common was bought by the Council on   
 Lord Somers' insistence to provide an 
 open space to replace land he gave up 
 for the Sewage Works in l865.         </content>
