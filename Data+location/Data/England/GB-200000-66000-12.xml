		<content> We usually hold our Sports Day on the 
 last Monday of the Summer Term. Both  
 teams,Davy(red) and Trevithick (blue) 
 try hard to win the Cup,which was     
 given by the people of the village.   
 Reds wanted to beat Blues especially  
 this year,because Blues had already   
 won the Swimming Gala.We have no      
 Sports Field, but a farmer kindly lets
 us use a field near the school.A      
 parent cuts the grass,but we have to  
 watch for thistles and cow dung.It is 
 good fun with running,sack,egg and    
 spoon,bean bag and obstacle races for 
 each age.This year we had a Mums' and 
 Dads' race.Twenty mothers ran in their
 event.We finished with boys and girls 
 throwing and shuttle relays for each  
 class.Reds won the Cup.
