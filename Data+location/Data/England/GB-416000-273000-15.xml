		<content>  Two{churches,}the Church of England  
 (St.Philips) and the Roman Catholic   
 (St.George &amp; St.Teresa) are in the    
 area and other denominations are to be
 found just outside.                   
  There is a flourishing Council of    
 Churches which promotes inter-church  
 co-operation and unity and members of 
 each church make up a working         
 committee.                            
  Inter-denominational religious events
 are arranged on a regular basis when  
 each church takes its turn to host an 
 event.This is particularly true at    
 Christmas and Easter.                 
  Social events are also arranged to   
 enable members to meet and on         
 occasions raise finances for some     
 universal charity.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
