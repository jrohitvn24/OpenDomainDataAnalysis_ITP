		<title>20CHURCHES IN ST VEEP &amp; GOLANT</title>
		<content>      The church of {St. Veep}has a 57 
 foot tower which houses the only      
 known set of{virgin bells}in England. 
 They were cast in the year 1770. The  
 present building dates from 1336 when 
 it was rededicated by Bishop          
 Grandisson of Exeter.                 
    The church houses eight solid      
 granite pillars, a granite font and an
 altar supported by granite legs. The  
 pulpit is decorated with remnants of a
 rood screen from an Oxfordshire       
 church.                               
{    St. Sampson}is a small church     
 at the top of the hill in Golant. It  
 was built before 1281.The present     
 building was consecrated by the       
 suffragan of Bishop Oldham in 1509.   
     The{methodist}chapel in Lerryn has
 been closed and converted into flats, 
 but the chapel in Golant is still a   
 place of worship.                     </content>
