 three-tier system. From the age of 5  
 children attend either Harlington or  
 Toddington St. George Lower Schools.

 One of the most popular{playground    
{games}is "Coventry". Somebody is "it" 
 and you have to get home without being
 seen. If the catcher sees you he runs 
 home and shouts "Coventry" and you are
 out. First home is "it" next time.    
 The Lower Schools had a simple{school 
{rule}- "Take care of yourself and     
 other people".                        </content>
