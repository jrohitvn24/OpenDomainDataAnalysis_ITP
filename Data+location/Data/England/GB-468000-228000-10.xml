		<title>10THE WILDLIFE OF PADBURY</title>
		<content> This area only 50 miles from London is
 fortunate in its abundance of wildlife
 Foxes abound here as they do in many  
 areas. The disused railway line is a  
 popular haunt for rabbits, perhaps the
 soil here is easier to burrow through 
 than the local clay. Hares can be seen
 in the cornfields. Weasels, grey      
 squirrels, badgers and muntjac deer   
 can be seen from time to time. The    
 tributary of the Great Ouse which     
 winds through the fields is the haunt 
 of water voles, several species of    
 duck, herons and even kingfishers.    
 Swans breed in the area and Canada    
 geese overwinter in the meadows . The 
 disused railway is a haven to many    
 species of insect, particularly       
 butterflies. The Orange Tip,Brimstone 
 Comma,Large White,Common Blue,Peacock,
 Red Admiral,Toroiseshell and Small    
 Copper can all be seen here.          </content>
