		<content> The original house was built in 1850  
 by William Woodgate a retired         
 solicitor living in Tonbridge. In 1871
 George Drummond bought the house and  
 more land. He kept adding to the 3    
 gabled house so that eventually it was
 6 times its original size. In 1917 Sir
 Earnest Cassell bought it and made it 
 a hospital. By 1947 it was a school.  
 Swaylands is now a school for awkward 
 boys.The school has 70 boys and nearly
 as many staff. The school and study   
 centre are run by the London Borough  
 of Barnet. Swaylands has gardens and  
 rockeries and some bushes over 100    
 years old. The swimming pool used to  
 be a rose garden. The farm has 6      
 fields 4 of which have sheep in. They 
 do not have profit growing fields but 
 they do pay their way. The soil has   
 Wealden clay in it which is also good 
 for making bricks.                    </content>
