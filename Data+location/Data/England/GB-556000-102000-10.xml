		<title>10THE ELDERLY IN WILLINGDON</title>
		<content>   Willingdon has a large proportion of
 elderly residents. Reasons expressed  
 for living here include its situation 
 in the South of England (for its      
 climate) and its closeness to         
 Eastbourne.                           
   Old people living alone tend to     
 visit Church Halls and similar venues 
 for leisure activities. Watching      
 entertainments seems to be preferred  
 to active participation in a hobby.   
   The Bernhard Baron Home in Polegate 
 has about sixty residents. It was     
 founded by a brewer and a stag in the 
 forecourt came from the grounds of his
 home. Subsequently it was supported by
 a cigarette manufacturer. It is now   
 run by Quakers.The residents have     
 entertainments provided for them at   
 the Home and appreciate its grounds   
 for outdoor leisure.
