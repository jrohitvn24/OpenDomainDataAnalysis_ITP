		<title>01Shouldham area.</title>
		<content>  Our block consists of farmland and   
 two villages. It is bisected by the   
 A134 road.                            
  The area is basically flat and parts 
 are planted with coniferous woodland  
 part of which is being superceeded by 
 broad leaved trees. The main crops    
 grown are cereals and sugar beet plus 
 livestock. Some of the farms are given
 over to intensive pig rearing and one 
 farm is producing apples and pears    
 with much re-planting being done in   
 the last year.                        
  The South East corner of the block is
 park land belonging to Sir John Bagge 
 of Stradsett Hall.                    
  The children of Shouldham Thorpe     
 attend the village school and the     
 shop/P.O. in Shouldham also serves    
 both villages. Each village has its   
 own church, part of Fincham group.
