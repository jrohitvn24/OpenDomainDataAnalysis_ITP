		<title>06Farming around Mousehole</title>
		<content>    The{farms}around{Mousehole}vary in 
 size from about 50 to 150 acres or    
 slightly more, with only a very few   
 small holdings.  The main produce from
 these{farms}is milk which is processed
 at the St. Ivel Creamary aty St. Erth.
    In order to feed the cattle during 
 the winter much of the land is        
 intensively managed grassland which is
 cropped for{hay and silage}during the 
 Spring and Summer.                    
    Some other crops which are grown in
 the area are{early Cornish potatoes,  
{spring cabbage, broccoli and flowers  
 such as anmemones and violets. The    
{farmers}of this area have the         
 advantage of very mild winters which  
 enables them to produce earlier crops 
 than most other areas of the mainland.
