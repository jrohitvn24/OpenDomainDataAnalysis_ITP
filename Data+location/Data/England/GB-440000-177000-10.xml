 these are{people's main}home.Only 4   
 are second homes. There are many old  
 houses in the area. 34 were built     
 before 1800 and 15 during the 19th    
 century.Between 1901 and 1950 19      
 houses were built.Since then 31 houses
 have been built.About half the houses 
 have 3 bedrooms.There are a few houses
 with 5 or 6 bedrooms. There seems to  
 be no desire to expand housing or for 
 units for light industry and so the   
 village seems to be diminishing.
