		<title>01The Fulwood Area.</title>
		<content> In the Middle Ages, Fulwood was part  
 of a Royal Forest. By the early 1800's
 it was still largely forest and waste 
 land, then in 1850 farmland was bought
 and its development began. In 1895    
 Fulwood became an urban district and  
 since then it has developed as a      
 residential area. Pre-war development 
 tended to follow the line of the A6.  
 After the war large estates grew first
 to the west of the A6 and since 1980  
 on its eastern side.These developments
 are bounded by the M6 &amp; M55 motorways.
 The area to the north and east of the 
 motorways is still largely farmland   
 with small residential developments.  
 Fulwood exists mainly as a residential
 and farming area with little industry.
 It has 3 high schools, 2 hospitals,a  
 barracks, hotels, restaurants, shops  
 and a leisure centre which serve a    
 much wider area.                      </content>
