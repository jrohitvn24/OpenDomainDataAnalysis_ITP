		<title>14THE BROMYARD HEALTH SERVICE</title>
		<content>    Bromyard needs a hospital due to   
 the many old people who live in       
 Bromyard.                             
    Bromyard has a{doctors' surgery    
 with a group practice of four doctors 
 and some district nurses. They treat  
 all illnesses except for emergencies. 
 Due to the distance from Hereford     
 hospitals, the practice needs a       
 comprehensive range of medical        
 supplies.                             
    The main{dental practice,}situated 
 in the High Street, has two working   
 dentists. This practice has been open 
 for over 50 years. People come to the 
 dentist from a 7-mile radius. During  
 the past two years the number of      
 patients has declined due to the      
 opening of another dental practice.   
    Bromyard has two{opticians.}For    
 emergency treatment people go to the  
 Eye Hospital in Hereford.             </content>
