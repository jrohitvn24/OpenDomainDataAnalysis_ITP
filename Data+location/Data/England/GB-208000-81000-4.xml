		<content> During the World Wars'1 and 2'house   
 windows were blacked out with curtains
 so that enemy bombers could not see   
 them.There wasn't a man in Camelford. 
 The women were left to carry on the   
 jobs and take care of everything.     
 Buildings have been changed over the  
 years and here are some of them:      
 Camelford Museum used to be a coach   
 makers. The Library used to be the    
 Town Hall. Bridge Garage was a cheese 
 factory and later a maternity hospital
 The house by Camelford Bridge is where
 a headmaster used to live.The Council 
  Offices were the Boys' Grammar       
 School. The fashions in 1905-1920 were
 ladies in long skirts and swaying     
 dresses. Little boys dressed in long  
 shorts and floppy caps. Life then was 
 much harder than now!
