		<title>05FARMING-DAIRY FARMING</title>
		<content> We talked to a dairy farm worker.They 
 have 194 milkers in their herd,which  
 takes 3 hours to milk daily.The cows  
 which had just calved were in a       
 seperate field resting for a few      
 months.                               
 They use modern milking methods which 
 takes a shorter time.Many fields were 
 used for rough grazing_some were used 
 for silage.                           
 We were told that if the farm produced
 more than their milk quota (Which was 
 1300,000 litres a year) they have to  
 pay the government.If they produce    
 less,they get money back to buy cattle
 so that they can produce more.
