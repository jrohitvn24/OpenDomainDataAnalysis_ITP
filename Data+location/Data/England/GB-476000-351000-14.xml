		<title>14Caravan life in Newark</title>
		<content> The gypsy woman lived in a mobile home
 which was siver and white and highly  
 polished.  She told us that the       
 biggest caravan on the site is 36 feet
 long and the smallest is 20 feet long.
 She was a true gypsy and liked her    
 life in a mobile home. She had been   
 there for two weeks but usually stays 
 for 6 months.  Her weekly costs were  
 about 15 pounds. She had no trouble   
 from lorry drivers. The rules of the  
 site were:                            
 1.All sites must be kept litter free. 
 2.No dogs.                            
 3.All rents paid promptly.            
 4.No subletting.                      
 5.Rents reviewed annually.            
 6.Any person may sell a caravan on the
 site provided the site owner receives 
 10% of the profit!                    
                                       
                                       </content>
