		<content>  Both villages now have only small    
 regular congregations and both        
 experience financial difficulties with
 the upkeep of their churches.         
  At Middleton the main short term     
 problem is that of bats living in the 
 church roof. The only other urgent    
 need is some re-pointing of the       
 steeple.                              
  The church at North Runcton is most  
 unusual being the work of Henry Bell  
 in the 17th century and not the       
 customary medieval building. We spoke 
 to one of the two{churchwardens}who   
 are resposible for the upkeep of the  
 church. We were impressed by the high 
 standard of maintenance and decoration
 of the church interior and were       
 surprised to learn that most of the   
 money for this has to be raised       
 locally.
