		<content>    The Express Dairy collects 385,000 
 litres of milk by tanker from 400     
 surrounding farms every day.The milk  
 is pumped from road tanks into three  
 storage tanks which store 100,000     
 gallons of milk.It goes from these    
 tanks into the cheese factory at a    
 rate of 10,000 gallons per hour.      
 It is pasteurized and pumped into     
 vats.Most of the milk is made into    
 Eden vale chedder cheese plus whey    
 butter and demineralised whey         
 powder.40,000 litres of milk are      
 taken for processing and is put into  
 cartons for milkmen. Milk from the    
 farms arrives at the creamery in the  
 tankers and is then sampled. Some of  
 the milk is made into 5kg or 20kg     
 blocks of cheese.More than 170 people 
 work at the Express Dairy. Our dads   
 work there.          Gayle Ingham
