		<content> This area also has a long tradition of
 connections with the{British Army }   
 based at nearby Aldershot.Hawley Woods
 and Hawley Common, are used as an     
 extensive training areas for the{Royal
{Engineers.}Hawley lake is also used as
 an army sailing base and for military 
 manoeuvres.The large concentration of 
 infant,primary and secondary schools  
 in the area were built to serve the   
 expanding population .The local       
{Frimley Park hospital}serves the local
 area.To counteract the fact that so   
 much land is now required for         
 housing,part of the{Blackwater Valley}
 is now being developed as a nature    
 reserve and recreation area.          
   This once quiet rural backwater is  
 in the 80's,a scene of continual and  
 rapid change,and due to these changes 
 has less{unemployment}than some other 
 parts of the country at this time.    </content>
