		<content> The local people in this area for     
 entertainment mainly go to a{Public   
{house}for either a drink with friends 
 or to play darts or skittles. Fox     
 hunting is held in the area once a    
 year. Many people choose to go into   
 Bristol to watch films or to see plays
 and to dine at restuarants.           
 For sport many people travel to       
 Thornbury Leisure Centre where a wide 
 selection of games are played. The    
 local school around the area hold     
 evening classes where one can learn   
 for leisure different subjects.       
 There are throughout the year village 
 dances and events for the local people
 to attend. Of course the main         
 enterainment of most people is either 
 television or radio.

 parents.                              </content>
