		<title>09THE KENILWORTH BYPASS</title>
		<content> This was built in the early 1970's as 
 a link between Warwick and Coventry.  
 Its construction caused a major impact
 on the largely rural surroudings. G.R.
 320735 - 344760. It intersects with   
 the Stonebridge Highway which runs w-e
 across the northern part of the area. 
 Opposition was based on loss of farm  
 land and noise pollution.The route    
 passed through Coventry Golf Course   
 land and directly through the         
 clubhouse!This is now re-located N.E. 
 of its former site.Noise from the road
 is the main problem and houses in     
 Finham have been given double glazing 
 grants to alleviate this problem.Noise
 is considerable even some distance    
 away on King's Hill.Local tradespeople
 such as Russell's and Smith's         
 nurseries report a marked reduction in
 passing trade.
