 In Fen Park there are many beautiful  
ducks. The water is stagnant because   
of trees shedding leaves and people    
dropping rubbish. The coots were       
abundant,they dived for food but       
the water is now too polluted. The Fen 
should be cleaned out and should       
be properly looked after then there    
would be no reason to cull the ducks.  
 The marsh across the road is being    
improved and made into a nature trail. 
There are many groups concerned with   
local ECOLOGY. Most local schools      
have a Nature club, although there are 
larger groups such as WATCH and The    
Suffolk Trust and the R.S.P.B which    
deals with birds. There are two        
quite rare birds in Lowestoft. They    
are the Black Redstart and the Snow    
Bunting.
