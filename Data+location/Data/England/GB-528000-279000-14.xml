		<title>14NEWMAN'S SHOP, WARBOYS</title>
		<content> The oldest shop in Warboys is called  
 NEWMAN'S. It is over 100 years old and
 it has been kept in its original      
 state. On the shelves there are 20 old
 tea tins with Chinese paintings on.   
 They have kept the old drawers which  
 were used for dried goods such as     
 dates, dried peas and currants. The   
 oak counter is the original and on the
 counter there still stands the        
 original oil lamp.                    
 The shop is now owned by Mrs. Newman  
 who has owned it for 26 years. There  
 is a full-time assistant who still    
 does deliveries on his bicycle.       
 The shop sells lots of things as well 
 as food, including clothes and shoes. 
 During the war the cellar was used as 
 an air raid shelter but now it floods 
 and has to be pumped out whenever it  
 rains and so it is kept empty.
