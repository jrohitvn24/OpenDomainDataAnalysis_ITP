		<content> An area of open common land and       
 woodland. The people who live in this 
 area have commoners rights to gather  
 firewood. The woodland is managed and 
 is a mixture of oak, beech, silver    
 birch and conifers. Carbins Wood has  
 just been bought by the North Moor    
 Trust in 1985 and there are plans to  
 make a nature trail. St.Anns fruit    
 farm is run as part of a unit for     
 young people with special needs. The  
 soft fruit grown include raspberries  
 and strawberries. The apple orchard   
 is being cut down this year as it as  
 proved uneconomic. All the people on  
 the farm are paid the same wages.     
 There are four community service      
 volunteers and ten young people       
 working on the farm.
