		<content> On the Questionnaires that were filled
 in 233 people said they were in       
 full-time employment, 117 said they   
 were in part-time employment and 36   
 people not in employment said they    
 would like to be.There are not very   
 many places of employment in Burton so
 we asked people just how far they     
 travelled daily to go to work-97      
 people said they travelled up to 5    
 miles which would include people who  
 worked in our village and people who  
 travelled to Scunthorpe to work,90    
 people said they travelled between 6  
 and 15 miles and 35 people said they  
 had to travel over 15 miles to their  
 place of work.One person said he      
 travelled 2000 miles and although we  
 did not ask we believe he is one of   
 those people who work in the oil      
 fields of the Middle East.
