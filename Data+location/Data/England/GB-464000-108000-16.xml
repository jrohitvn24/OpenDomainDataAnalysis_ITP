		<title>16GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF AREA</title>
		<content> The area is fairly level and ranges   
 from 38 to 43 metres above sea        
 level.There are no factories or other 
 factors to cause air pollution. A main
 feature of this area is a recently    
 constructed by-pass which has allowed 
 the old A.3 passing through           
 Waterlooville to become a Pedestrian  
 Precinct.  This was officially opened 
 by the Mayor of Havant on 4th May     
 1985. The majority of the area        
 surveyed is open countryside where    
 beef cattle,pigs,sheep and horses     
 comprise the livestock.  However a    
 densely populated block(the Berg      
 Estate)does exist and this consists of
 detached, semi-detatched and flat     
 dwellings.  A breakdown would indicate
 that 14% is woodland,18% residential, 
 62% open land and 6% industry.
