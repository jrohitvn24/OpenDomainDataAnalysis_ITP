		<title>02BELLINGHAM BUSINESS.</title>
		<content> We interviewed three local business   
 people about their businesses.Most    
 would prefer to use local materials   
 but this is not possible.They employ  
 between 5 and 10 local citizens.Most  
 thought that Bellingham would become a
 retirement village rather than an     
 industrial one.One thought that as    
 Kielder Water increased in            
 popularity,so Bellingham's trade would
 increase also.                        
 As business people their thoughts turn
 to unemployment,which they think is   
 terrible.As private citizens their    
 needs are fulfilled by the usual      
 pubs,churches and local facilities    
 that Bellingham has,but they all      
 believe that for a happy environment  
 the warmth and friendliness of        
 Northumbrians are all that are needed.
