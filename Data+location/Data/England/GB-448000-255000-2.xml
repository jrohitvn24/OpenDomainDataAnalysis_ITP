		<content>    Most{Arts &amp; Crafts}practised in    
 Priors Marston are hobbies or leisure 
 time pursuits; but some form a{cottage
{industry}providing additional family  
 income, such as -                     
       Dressmaking,   Carpentry,       
       Furniture Renovation,           
       Curtain &amp; Cushion Making,       
       Upholstery &amp; Soft Furnishings.  
    Many crafts are self-taught from   
 books or have been learned at adult   
 education courses. A weekly{Craft     
{Class,}initially organised through the
 Women's Institute but now run by      
 Warwickshire County Council, has been 
 in operation in the Village Hall for 3
 years. It has been well attended by   
 women in the village and a variety of 
 crafts have been taught -             
       Patchwork,  Quilting,           
       Tapestry,   Canvas Embroidery,  
       Upholstery, Lampshade Making.   </content>
