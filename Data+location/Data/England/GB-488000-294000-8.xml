		<title>08HOUSING IN GRETTON</title>
		<content>Housing in Gretton can be split into   
three different types. Firstly, the    
houses of the old village which are    
situated around the Parish Church.     
These are mainly built of stone and    
originally had thatched roofs, most of 
which have now been replaced by tiles. 
Secondly, in 1920, again in 1931, and  
again in the late 1950's council houses
were added extending the village       
towards the south-east. Thirdly, in the
1970's, Gretton was further extended by
the building of 80 new houses in a     
private estate. The oldest house in the
village is what used to be the Manor   
House. This now needs so much repair   
that no-one lives in it. Gretton       
House, a large stone building which    
used to be a rehabilitation centre     
belonging to the British Steel         
Corporation, is now a home for         
handicapped people.                    </content>
