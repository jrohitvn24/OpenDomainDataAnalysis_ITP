		<content> Ecology has an influence on the area  
 weatherwise. At the time of writing we
 have just suffered a disastrous summer
 following a cold wet spring. This is a
 very windy region maybe because the   
 terrain tends to be flat and open. The
 soil varies, parts are loam and       
 fairly light in contrast to belts of  
 heavy clay.  There are two deciduous  
 woods and some small spinneys dotted  
 over the landscape.Hulcote and Winter 
 Wood are two areas of confined        
 woodland and Winter Wood.The only     
 footpath known to be in general use at
 present, leads off Broughton Road just
 past the old Smithy across land owned 
 by College Farm up to Salford Wood.   
 Birds native to this country and      
 migrants such as the swallow and      
 cuckoo are plentiful.Wild life is well
 represented by rabbits, small animals,
 insects and reptiles.                 </content>
