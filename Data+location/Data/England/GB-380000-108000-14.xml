		<title>14BELLRINGING</title>
		<content> There has been a long tradition of    
 bell-ringing in Okeford Fitzpaine.    
 There are six bells in the church of  
 St.Andrew, of which five were re-cast 
 in 1821 and one added in 1906.        
 The young people are encourasged to   
 learn the bell-ringing skills and the 
 Ridout family have maintained the     
 tradition in recent years.  Of the    
 present comoany of bell-ringers, three
 are still of this family including the
 captain of the ringers.
