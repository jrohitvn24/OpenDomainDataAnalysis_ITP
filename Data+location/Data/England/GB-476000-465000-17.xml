		<content>   As this is a rural area,the use of a
 car is both convenient and essential. 
   A service bus runs one day each week
 to{YORK,}returning after three hours, 
 stopping at{LANGTON}and{KENNYTHORPE   
 en route.During the week a local coach
 company picks up passengers at most of
 the villages,between school runs.     
 People wishing to go to{MALTON }or    
{YORK}at any other time would have to  
 take a taxi. Walking or cycling to    
{MALTON}means negotiating a long hill. 
 During hard winters most roads leading
 towards{MALTON}and{YORK}get blocked by
 snow,leaving the villages cut off.    
   The{SCARBOROUGH}to{YORK}railway line
 runs along the edge of{LOW HUTTON     
 although it no longers stops there.The
 old station house has been sold and is
 now a private house.                  
    The {RIVER DERWENT}has no traffic  
 except for the occassional canoe.     </content>
