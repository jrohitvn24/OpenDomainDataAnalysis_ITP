		<content> MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHOM WE INTRVIEWED 
 EXPRESSED CONCERN FOR THE MAINTAINANCE
 OF A SLOWER PACE OF LIFE IN THE AREA. 
 SEVERAL FAMILIES HAVE LIVED IN THE    
 AREA FOR GENERATIONS AND ARE KEEN TO  
 SEE IT PRESERVED IN ITS PRESENT FORM. 
 HOWEVER, THERE IS AN INCREASING       
 MOVEMENT OF YOUNGER PEOPLE TOWARDS THE
 URBAN CENTRE OF NORTHAMPTON WHERE BOTH
 EMPLOYMENT AND PROPERTY PRICES ARE    
 MORE CONDUCIVE TO THEIR NEEDS.        
 OLDER RESIDENTS EXPRESS A RELUCTANCE  
 TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES IN THE EVENING AS
 THEY HEAR TALES OF PEOPLE BEING       
 ATTACKED, ROBBED OR BURGLED.          
 MOTHERS OF YOUNG CHILDREN FEAR FOR    
 THEIR SAFETY BOTH ON THE ROADS AND    
 FROM MOLESTERS, EVEN DURING DAYLIGHT  
 HOURS ON QUIET THOROUGHFARES.         
 SINCE THE AREA IS FAST BECOMING A     
 DORMITORY FOR NORTHAMPTON, PEOPLE ARE 
 CONCERNED THAT VILLAGE LIFE MAY FADE. </content>
