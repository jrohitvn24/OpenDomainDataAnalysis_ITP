		<title>05Haltwhistle Railway Station.</title>
		<content>    Haltwhistle is on the Newcastle    
 Carlisle railway line.                
    It is a very long station, the two 
 platforms are 387 metres long.  The   
 buildings are painted blue and white. 
 There were wild flowers growing in the
 old sidings and on the wall.          
    There is a man working in the      
 signal box and sometimes the men who  
 mend the railway line stop at the     
 station.                              
    Twenty seven trains a day stop at  
 the station but as it is an unstaffed 
 halt you have to buy your ticket on   
 the train.  It costs{Â£2.40}to go to   
 Newcastle and{Â£1.60}to go to Carlisle 
 on the diesel trains.                 
    People going to work use the early 
 trains and people going shopping.  All
 the children going to the High School 
 at Haydon Bridge from Haltwhistle     
 travel by train.                      </content>
