		<content>                                       
 Most pupils get up soon after seven   
 and put on their uniform,which is a   
 dark blazer or sweater,a white shirt  
 and a tie.After breakfast some pupils 
 watch television before walking to    
 school,which starts at nine.First the 
 register is called,then they have     
 assembly where they sing hymns and say
 prayers.Then their lessons begin.They 
 have seven in the day,four before     
 dinner and three after.Some lessons   
 are interesting,but many are boring.  
 Most teachers are strict but some are 
 fun.Pupils have a break in the morning
 and play in a yard.Most pupils usually
 have dinner in school,either their own
 food or a school meal,but this summer 
 they all have to go home as their     
 teachers are not supervising them.Most
 pupils think education is important   
 but many do not like their school day.</content>
