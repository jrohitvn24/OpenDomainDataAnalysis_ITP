		<title>09Market Hill-the market today</title>
		<content> Every Thursday a market is held in the
 market square.People in vans come to  
 set up stalls on which to put their   
 goods.There are around a dozen        
 different stalls selling              
 toys,crockery,clothes,vegetables      
 plants and foodstuff.Many of the goods
 on the market are new from factories  
 or fresh from market gardens.Mum goes 
 there every week and she says it is   
 better than shops because it is much  
 cheaper .The stall holders start to   
 pack up at about 5 o'clock pm.        
  The market is hundreds of years old  
 and is very successful.The market has 
 recently been brightened up with new  
 paving and plant borders.             
  With the Magistrates Court behind,the
 Market Square looks most picturesque  
 on a Thursday morning in Summer.
