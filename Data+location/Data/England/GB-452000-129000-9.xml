		<content> The Itchen Valley Flower Show takes   
 place annually in July.               
 There is one public house in our      
 block called {'The Percy Hobbs'. }This
 pub was originally called the 'New    
 Inn' but was recently renamed after   
 its oldest regular customer who is 85 
 years of age. This pub has a little   
 trade from Easton but draws most of   
 business from the nearby Caravan      
 Site.It has a flourishing summer trade
 with facilities for children.         
 Licensing Hours are:                  
 Weedays: 10.30am -2.30pm              
           6.00pm-10.30pm              
 Sundys:  12.00pm -2.00pm              
           7.00pm-10.30pm.             
 Licensing Hours could change in the   
 near future. A strong lobby of        
 opinion wants flexible opening hours  
 as in Europe.                         
                                       </content>
