		<title>15 DAILY LIFE: A MILKMAN</title>
		<content>   The milkman starts work at about    
4.30 a.m. First he loads up the float. 
It is powered by battery so it is quiet
as it goes round the streets. At the   
dairy he loads crates of bottles onto  
the float, then he starts his round.   
   He drives the float to the street,  
then puts the milk bottles on people's 
doorsteps. He has an order book which  
tells him how many pints of milk to    
deliver. He also sells cream, bread,   
yoghurt and fruit juice. On Fridays and
Saturdays he collects money from his   
customers. In the week he stops work at
about 1.30 p.m.                        
   Back at the dairy he unloads the    
empty bottles that he picked up when he
left the full ones. The float has to be
charged up again ready for the next    
day. The job is well paid, but hard in 
winter.                                
                                       </content>
