		<content> The 1981 Census tells us that in the  
 Slaithwaite/Marsden area, the level of
 social wellbeing is 'below average'.  
 Less than 4% of the households have   
 six or more people in them and rhe    
 average person per room ratio is below
 0.60.Below 0.5% of the population are 
 of West Indian or Asian origin.       
   Our own survey showed that most     
 people in each household belong to the
 same nuclear family with few in-laws  
 or dependents living in.An estimated  
 25% of the population of the block are
 pensioners and most like to lead an   
 independent life.They own or rent some
 40% of the Victorian and Edwardian    
 terraced properties in HillTop.Others 
 live in the bungalows in Olney Street 
 and Mona Street designed by Kirklees  
 Council for pensioners.Many were born 
 here and used to work locally.They    
 have no intention of moving away.     </content>
