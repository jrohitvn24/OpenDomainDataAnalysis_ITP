		<content> This area is almost entirely          
 agricultural,the land being rich and  
 fertile ,well drained and crossed     
 numerous minor roads and farm         
 tracks.Most farms rear cattle ,either 
 for dairy produce or beef and one     
 family ,the Wannops ,have a farm whose
 acreage is over 1100.They have many   
 relatives who also own farms.(see     
  Linstock Castle Farm)                
      Some of the farmers interviewed  
 said they were reducing their dairy   
 herds because of E.E.C regulations and
 switching to beef instead.In this area
 farmers agreed that a farm must be at 
 least 150 acres to support a          
 prosperous dairy herd.                
  The average size of fields in this   
 area is 5 hectars.Our land covage     
 survey shows a predominamtly grassland
 area _either grazing or for silage.
