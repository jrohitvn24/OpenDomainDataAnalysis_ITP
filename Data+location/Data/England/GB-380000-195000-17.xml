		<content> The "Hunters Hall" pub dates back     
 about 500 years with existing         
 buildings up to 400 years old.  It was
 a Coaching Inn, with stables, on the  
 Gloucester-Bath turnpike road.  Its   
 site also includes the old Smithy and 
 Village Hall.  The road, now the A4135
 from Dursley to Tetbury still brings  
 customers from these two towns and    
 from Nailsworth and Wotten-under-Edge,
 attracted by its reputation as a      
 friendly free-house with excellent    
 beers and historic buildings.  The pub
 is used by local customers but would  
 not be viable on village trade alone. 
 The Hunter's Hall Retaurant is in the 
 "Good Food Guide" and attracts custom 
 from even further afield and provides 
 a range of food from sandwiches to    
 three course meals.  It has a good    
 reputation in the surrounding area.
