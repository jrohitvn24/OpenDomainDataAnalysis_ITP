		<content> The{market}in Wokingham started over  
 700 years ago acquiring a reputation  
 for fat fowls. A change occured in the
 late 19th century when the market     
 became renowned for poultry but then  
 began to decline.                     
 This {decline}was increased by the out
 break of World War Two but the market 
 still sells cheese, eggs, fish and    
 vegetables today.                     
 The annual Wokingham {Carnival} was   
 first held in 1929 with all the       
 proceeds going towards local          
 charities. The event is still held at 
 the Cantley ground and attracts a     
 large proportion of the community.    
 Scouts and Guides parade through the  
 town on St Georges Day and on other   
 special occasions. There are also     
 frequent {parades }by the youth groups
 in the towns churches.
