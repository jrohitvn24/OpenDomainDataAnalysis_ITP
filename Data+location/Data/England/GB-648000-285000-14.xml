		<content> There are 3 officially recognised farm
 campsites in the area. Reasons for    
 tourism being proximity of sea, Oulton
 Broad, local scenery and historic     
 buildings. There are no regular public
 transport services through Henstead or
 Rushmere. The A12 is the nearest      
 regular bus stop route northwards into
 Lowestoft or south to various towns   
 and ultimately to Ipswich. Every      
 Tuesday a bus leaves Henstead at      
 9.30am returning at noon to carry     
 shoppers into Beccles. 19% of the     
 sample study group used a taxi service
 from time to time, the firms being    
 based in Lowestoft. Private transport 
 is therefore essential. 75% of        
 households studied owned a car, 35%   
 had 2. 95% of cars were in daily use. 
 31% of households owned a motorcycle  
 /moped, 80% used daily. 75% had bikes 
 66% were in daily use.                </content>
