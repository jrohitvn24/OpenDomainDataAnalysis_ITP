		<content>     There is not much employment in   
 the Ebberston, most people work       
 outside of the village. The main work 
 in the area is on farms. In the       
 village we have a Builder, two Joiner,
 Painter and Decorators, a Woodworker  
 and a Blacksmith's. The Foxholm Hotel 
 and the Grapes Inn are also           
 buisnesses which employ village       
 people. The caravan site at the Carr  
 House Farm provides some employment.  
                                       
     There is only Electricity in this 
 area, if you want to use gas you must 
 have bottled gas.
