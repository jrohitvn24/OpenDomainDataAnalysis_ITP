 covering the SE quarter of the        
 block.It is a commuter town with many 
 people commuting to nearby large      
 towns.It has a compact shopping centre
 with new and old buildings. Wednesday,
 market day,and Saturday are the       
 busiest days.There are large private  
 estates at NE and SW ends of the      
 town.The council estates are scatte-  
 red about the town with large estates 
 in Little Drayton.To the South of the 
 town is the Tern Valley which  has    
 proved a natural barrier to           
 development.The A53 trunk road splits 
 the area from the NE to SW corners.A  
 3km by-pass  carries passing traffic, 
 avoiding the narrow town centre       
 streets. The remains of the station   
 and disused railway tracks are all    
 that is left of the railways. Dairy   
 and arable farms surround the town.   </content>
