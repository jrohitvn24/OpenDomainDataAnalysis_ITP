		<content>  Every morning I get up about 7       
o'clock and have a game on my Amstrad  
computer.  When I have finished getting
changed, my mother cooks my breakfast. 
When it is twenty to nine, I go to     
school. We have French or reading, then
maths. We have English after play and  
dinner at 12.30.  In the afternoon we  
do art and  craft.  I like school but  
I like it better when I return home I  
soon go out and play football.  When   
we have finished I go to the shops and 
buy a drink.  Then I go home, watch    
television, go upstairs and listen to  
Duran Duran.  Then I have tea and go   
out again.  I come inside at 8.30 watch
television to 9.00, then go to bed,    
when I just remember to learn my       
spellings. Then I fall asleep.         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
