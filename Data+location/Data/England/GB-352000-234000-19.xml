		<content>{Holme Lacy House}is just outside the  
 village, but what happens there is    
{quite important to the villagers}as   
 they will be affected by the{traffic  
 and the{opportunities for work.       
 Several of the older people had worked
 there when it was being used, some in 
 the grounds and some indoors.   None  
 of them liked it being empty, and most
 had some{ideas about its future.      
 Although some thought it might be     
 turned into a{school}or{flats, a      
{hospital}or some sort of{leisure      
{place -}such as a{country club}or a   
{health farm}- many thought it would   
 be bought by{someone rich.  }Most     
 thought it should be used usefully, as
 a{community home}or for the{good of   
{the people of the county,}with        
 suggestions of a{youth hostel,}an{old 
{people's home,}a{hotel}or a{holiday   
{home.                                 </content>
