 he likes them to win especially if my 
 team loses.                           
   After half time the whistle went and
 we started to play, as the game went  
 on I thought that Tottenham would     
 lose, but they scored and I stood up  
 and cheered like mad with the rest of 
 the fans it was a really exiting      
 feeling to be there with all those    
 people cheering my one greatest team. 
 By the last five minutes Tottenham had
 given away a penalty so I thought it  
 was going to be a draw but Wolves     
 missed and the ball went over the bar 
 much to my relief. Then the referee   
 blew the whistle for the end of the   
 match, I cheered and shouted for my   
 team had won.This was one of the most 
 exiting days in my life and the one I 
 remember best of all.
