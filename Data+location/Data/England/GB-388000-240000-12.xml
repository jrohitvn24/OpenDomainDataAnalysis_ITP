 The Cider House known as 'The Monkey' 
 is in the hamlet of Woodmancote near  
 Defford. It has a special old recipe  
 for cider, but it is now produced by a
 wellknown Hereford Cider maker. A     
 local inhabitant, now 81 years old,   
 says the cider is nothing like it used
 to be:  "One and a half pints and you 
 could be flat out".                   
{STRENSHAM MILL.  }                    
 There has been a corn mill on this    
 site since the 15th century. It was in
 use at least until last century.There 
 was a serious fire in 1958 and it was 
 largely rebuilt. It has a been a      
 private dwelling for many years. It   
 has extensive views from all the      
 windows. The owner lets river moorings
 to private boat-owners at so much a   
 foot of boat, and each plot is well   
 kept with lawns and trees.            </content>
