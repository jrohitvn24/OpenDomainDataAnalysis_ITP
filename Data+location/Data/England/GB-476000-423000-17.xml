		<title>17Shopping in the Area.</title>
		<content> Altogether we found only four shops in
 the area that we were studying.One of 
 these shops,a Post Office,was in      
 Reedness.In Laxton there was another  
 shop,also a Post Office,while in Hook 
 there were two shops,a Post Office and
 a Village Store.All the Post Offices  
 had a general counter and catered for 
 the day to day needs of the people in 
 the area that they served.The Post    
 Office in Hook also had an Off Licence
 Department.The Village Store at Hook  
 is also the local Newsagent.In all the
 villages local tradesmen called in    
 their vans selling goods such as wet  
 fish,meat,bread and fried fish and    
 chips.The Humberside County Council   
 Mobile Library also paid regular      
 visits.For main shopping needs people 
 have to go to the nearest large       
 town,Goole,or even further to         
 Hull,Doncaster or Scunthorpe.         </content>
