		<title>17West Wratting: Some Pets</title>
		<content> One of the residents sheep was ill and
 he was not sure what was wrong with   
 it. This is one of the orphans which  
 he bottle-fed a few winters ago and as
 a lamb followed him about the house.  
 Now and again a couple of them have to
 go to market, which makes him a bit   
 sad.  He doesn't get much for them,   
 but since he was a shepherd in the    
 war, he has kept a few ewes of his    
 own. Booboo is a tame bantam, who     
 lives a life of luxury compared with  
 the Rhode Island Reds in the pens down
 the garden. She's the freedom of the  
 flower and vegetable garden and       
 normally lays freely apart from this  
 year. Maybe she doesn't like the      
 chilly weather either. Booboo roosts  
 on the washing machine at night. She  
 strolls in around dusk and a newspaper
 is provided for her to sleep on.
