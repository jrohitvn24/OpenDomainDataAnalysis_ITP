		<title>05THE READING ROOM IN YANWORTH</title>
		<content>{    About  1900 Lord Eldon had built a
{Reading Room as an early working men's
{club. }One of  Yanworth's  oldest  men
 recalls how  from six to nine at night
 men  over 20  could  enjoy  the  daily
 newspaper, dominoes, bagatelle etc.   
 Usually  no children  were allowed and
 then only with their fathers.    Women
 were  only admitted to  hear the local
 M.P. at General Election meetings.    
     In 1938 Lord Vestey  restored  and
 enlarged the building in commemoration
 of George V1's  coronation.   Changing
 attitudes  and   interests   saw   the
 building used for village  dances  and
 concerts. For a time there was a small
 band and choir  of  local  people.   A
 shepherd's  son is  remembered for his
 violin playing.                       
     Recently there has been a  further
 extension and outside a barbecue built
 to cater for modern tastes.           </content>
