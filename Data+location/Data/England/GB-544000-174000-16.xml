		<content> The alarm clock wakes us up at 6.30.My
 husband has to leave home by 7.00 to  
 be ahead of the traffic build up on   
 Shooters Hill.I call my daughter at   
 7.30 and drive her to school at       
 8.50.It is sometimes difficult to     
 cross the jam on Bellegrove Road.I    
 stay in school as a parent helper     
 until lunchtime,guiding the children  
 in the use of the school              
 computer.After lunch  I feed our      
 Yorkshire Terrier and take him for a  
 short walk.                           
 Housework takes up the afternoon until
 it is time to collect Diane from      
 school at 3.35.We often do some       
 gardening or put our computer on until
 teatime.My husband is a self_employed 
 carpet fitter and tea-time depends on 
 his arrival home.We watch             
 T.V._starting with the 6.00 News.We   
 go to bed at 11.00 usually.           </content>
