		<title>01Castle Acre Northwards</title>
		<content> Castle Acre (population about 1000) is
 picturesque with many flint and tiled 
 houses.  Its ruined 11th C Castle (and
 Priory in adjoining block) attract    
 tourists.  It is a Conservation Area. 
 Over 40 new houses have been built in 
 the last 10 years, bringing in new    
 blood.  Its school (infants) is       
 threatened with closure.  There is no 
 industry here and indigenous          
 employment is mostly connected with   
 agriculture.  Other inhabitants work  
 in nearby towns.  Unemployment is low.
  Nearby is the hamlet of Newton       
 (population less than 50).  Outsided  
 the village the countryside rolls     
 gently, ranging from 100 to 150 feet  
 above sea level.  Trees are mainly    
 found in shelter belts and            
 characteristic round coppices.
