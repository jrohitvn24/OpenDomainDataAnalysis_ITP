		<content> There is little employment in the area
 other than a few jobs in service      
 industries and agriculture, dairy and 
 arable farming. The only light        
 industry is a sawmill. There is some  
 employment in horticulture, an orchard
 and a nursery. The majority of jobs   
 are in service industries, the        
 Bluebell railway (a preserved steam   
 railway catering for tourists), a     
 small Roman Catholic language and     
 finishing school and a retirement     
 home. Domestic service provides jobs  
 for cleaners and gardeners in the     
 several large houses; the owners work 
 outside the area, often commuting to  
 London.
