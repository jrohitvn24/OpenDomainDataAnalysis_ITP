		<content>     On a typical day I get up about   
 seven o'clock and I have to make my   
 bed, brush my hair and make my        
 sandwiches.                           
                                       
     I have to be at school by nine    
 o'clock. We have an integrated day at 
 school, which means that we choose    
 when we do our maths, language and    
 topic work.                           
                                       
     When I go home at three o'clock I 
 play outside. I have my tea at about  
 seven o'clock and after I have played 
 out for a while I have a bath and then
 watch television until I go to bed at 
 about nine o'clock.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
