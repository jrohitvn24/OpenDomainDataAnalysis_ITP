		<content>  Corse and Staunton have separate     
 parish councils. Mr Dent is Chairman  
 of Staunton Parish Council and Mr     
 Lewis of Corse Parish Council.        
 The councillors are elected every 3   
 years. They look after the footpaths  
 and discuss whether new houses ought  
 to be built.                          
  The Forest of Dean District Council  
 at Cinderford is responsible for      
 refuse collection once a week, drains 
 and sewers.                           
 The County Council in Gloucester is   
 responsible for the police, education,
 fire service, roads and the library   
 van.                                  
 When we have general elections our    
 school is closed for the people of    
 Corse to vote in. Staunton people vote
 in Staunton Church Hall. Our Member of
 Parliament is Paul Marland, M.P. for  
 West Gloucestershire.                 </content>
