		<title>06WEST VALE AREA</title>
		<content> Three points of interst about West    
 Vale are Clayhouse, North Dean Wood   
 and Calderdale Way.  Clayhouse is a   
 fine 17th century house with aisled   
 barn, once owned by the Clay family   
 and now headquarters of Calderdale    
 Museum Service.  There is a room of   
 information for the North Dean Nature 
 Trail which starts and finishes here. 
 The wood is dominated by oak and      
 birch trees.   North Dean Wood Charity
 appears in records in 1757 applying   
 profits from wood sales to help local 
 poor.   The warden of the trail and   
 nature reserve is based at Clayhouse. 
 He organises guided walks and a young 
 people's weekly nature group.         
 The Calderdale Way starts and finishes
 at Clayhouse.  It was established in  
 1974, first major recreation path in  
 Britain, 50 miles long. It stretches  
 throughout Calderdale.                </content>
