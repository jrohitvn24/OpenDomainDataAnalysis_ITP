		<title>04FARMING: CROPWELL BUTLER</title>
		<content> The majority of this high quality     
 fertile land is level and well        
 drained, and is farmed on the arable  
 system. The crops are milling wheat,  
 malting barley, oil seed rape &amp; sugar 
 beet. There are two large owner-      
 occupied farms, based at The Grove &amp;  
 The Rookery. There is a livestock     
 enterprise on the grass and parkland  
 surrounding the house at The Grove on 
 which fifty Limousin beef cattle are  
 fattened. The farms employ 3 or 4 men,
 living within easy access. All the    
 farms in this area use many tractors  
 costing Â£26,000 each and some employ  
 contractors with specialised equipment
 especially for sugar beet. The corn is
 combine harvested, every farmer having
 at least one harvester; the large corn
 growers having several. Some arable   
 farms have drying facilities for corn 
 crops which yield about 2 tons/acre.  </content>
