		<title>13Our School 2</title>
		<content> Our school day is from 8.55 to 3.00pm.
 We come to school five days a week,   
 doing such things as reading, writing,
 mathematics, art and craft, music, p.e
 and topic work. Some mums come in to  
 help us. There are various clubs after
 school, that we can take part in.     
 These include cricket, football,      
 gymnastics, rounders, netball, chess  
 and craft work. We spend the whole day
 at school. We have our lunch at       
 school, either a packed lunch or a hot
 dinner. We have 2 cooks and 2 helpers 
 in the kitchen. 100 dinners are cooked
 each day. Dinners are also cooked for 
 the old people. We have 5 dinner      
 ladies who look after us at lunchtime.
 Groundsmen come in every Thursday.    
 They cut the grass, mark out the track
 and carry out general gardening       
 duties. They use a tractor mower to   
 cut the field .                       </content>
