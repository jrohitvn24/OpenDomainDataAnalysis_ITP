		<title>16Racial Minorities</title>
		<content> The majority of those who form this   
 group are of Indian or Chinese (Hong  
 Kong) origin. They form a very small  
 percentage of the total population.   
 Adults are in business, (Chinese      
 people having take-away foot outlets, 
 and Indians small general shops)      
 Indian shops are open during the day  
 until quite late; Chinese shops mainly
 at night. All have moved into the area
 in recent years. Elder people are     
 first generation immigrants and some  
 adults (especially Chinese) speak     
 little or no English. Some of the     
 children were born in England and they
 have differing views. One Indian girl 
 likes the friendliness of the people. 
 One Chinese would like to return to   
 Hong Kong eventually. Some families   
 have relatives in England, whom they  
 visit. Native traditions and religions
 are preserved &amp; families like privacy.</content>
