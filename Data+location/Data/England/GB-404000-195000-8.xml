		<content>  "I approve of the way the village is 
 changing. I'd like to see more        
 changes, so there'd be some more      
 employment for young people. I often  
 go up to Cirencester to see friends,  
 go shopping and see the doctor. I     
 don't use town much for anything else,
 because there's enough going on in    
 Cerney.                               
  "For entertainment I go to the Cosy  
 Club (Cerney Over Sixties). There we  
 go on evening trips and theatre       
 visits. I also play skittles and I get
 out quite often. I might go out for   
 the day to visit friends. A friend    
 would pick me up in his car and take  
 me out.                               
  "I used to do some nursing, then I   
 was a home help for old people. I     
 worked in Cirencester Hospital. I     
 didn't earn a lot, and worked long    
 hours."                               </content>
