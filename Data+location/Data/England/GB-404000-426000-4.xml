		<content>{Lumb Mill-reported by Mrs S Beaumont  
 About 100 years ago a woman jumped    
 from the loft window killing herself. 
 She is believed to walk around the    
 mill, now a private house, once a     
 year. The electric cooker occasionally
 turns itself off and on and the timer 
 bell goes off on its own.             
{Lower Shaw Booth-reported by Mr S Cann
 In the 1600s the house was owned by a 
 privateer. He brought home a black    
 slave who was converted to            
 christianity but when he died he was  
 refused burial by the church and was  
 buried in the barn by the house which 
 he is said to haunt.                  
{UFO sighting-reported by Mrs F Marsden
 About 7 years ago Mrs Marsden saw a   
 cigar-shaped object in the sky above  
 the moor by Castle Carr Road.  It was 
 orange and remained stationary. It was
 visible for 10 minutes.               </content>
