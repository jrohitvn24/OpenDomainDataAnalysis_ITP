		<content> In the heart of Middleton village is a
 small croft donated by the Waterhouse 
 estate and converted into a children's
 playground with a tarmacadam surface  
 for the two swings and the war        
 memorial lawn. A committee arranges   
 fund raising functions including talks
 of local interest, band concerts,     
 whist drives, discos.                 
 Two residents have an excellent       
 collection of vintage cars. These     
 provide considerable interest and are 
 frequently seen around the village.   
 The High Peak Hunt meets in the       
 village twice a year, providing a     
 colourful and lively occasion.        
 Visitors and tourists come from far   
 and wide to enjoy the features and    
 qualities described in this survey.   
 Special provision includes two picnic 
 sites, waymarked footpaths and cycle  
 routes and scenic routes for cars.    </content>
