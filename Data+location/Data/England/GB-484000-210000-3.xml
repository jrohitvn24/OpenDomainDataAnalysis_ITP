With a bright painted door,            
And a rambling rose,                   
And friendly neighbours,               
And open fires,                        
And a pigeon-loft in the yard.         
                                       
        Weston Turville Houses.        
  Some of the houses in Weston Turville
show the local history.There is the old
manor house near the Norman  church,   
which dates back to  Georgian times.   
There are examples of 16th century     
thatched cottages which once belonged  
to farm workers. There are Victorian   
houses such as the old rectory in the  
village. Weston Turville is still      
continuing to grow, with all types of  
housing being built.There are examples 
of detached houses,semi-detached       
houses, maisonettes and council        
houses in the village.                 </content>
