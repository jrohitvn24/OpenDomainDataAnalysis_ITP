		<content> 11.00am. We came home and watched a   
 programme on T.V. I didn't know what  
 it was called because we started      
 watching it in the middle. It was very
 good. It was about a brother and      
 sister who were singers and the sister
 had a very valuable necklace and some 
 men were trying to get it.            
 12.15pm. We got in the car and went to
 Bristol. We parked in a multi-storey  
 car park and met Mummy at the Wimpy   
 Bar. (This is a food bar and I had a  
 cheese burger and chips and coke.     
 Yummy!).                              
 1.30pm. We left the Wimpy Bar to buy  
 Rebecca and myself some shoes. We went
 to a few more shops in town but could 
 not find any shoes to fit me, so we   
 went to Staple Hill.                  
 5.10pm. We found some shoes. They were
 red and had a strap which you could   
 turn round to make the shoes slip-ons.</content>
