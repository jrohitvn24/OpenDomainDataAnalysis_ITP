  Otley Hall is a large building       
surrounded by a moat. There is evidence
of pargetted plaster and the half      
timbered and brick-studded building is 
crowned by high roofs and towering     
chimneys. It was the Gosnold family    
home from 1440-1674. They were typical 
Renaissance landed gentry and gentlemen
adventurers, hard-headed justices and  
squires whose sons voyaged to the New  
World, waited upon the King at court or
served their county in the Commons,    
year after year amassing lands, silver,
jewels, money and prestige, marrying   
into the East-Anglian nobility, Bacons,
Wingfields and Tollemaches, and        
occupying estates in all parts of      
Suffolk.                               
  Within the Gosnold family Bartholomew
