		<title>11FOLKLORE IN NORTH TYNEDALE</title>
		<content> The most famous legend connected with 
 this area is{"The Long Pack".}The     
 story goes that in 1723 the owner of  
{Lee Hall},a Colonel Ridley, was away  
 in London and left the house in the   
 charge of a maid-servant named Alice  
 and two male servants name Richard and
 Edward. One afternoon{a pedlar}called 
 requesting a nights lodging and when  
 this was refused he obtained          
 permission to leave his large pack    
 overnight. Later, whilst Alice was    
 examining the pack she saw it move,   
 and she called Richard and Edward. The
 latter brought a large gun called     
{Copenhagen}and emptied the contents of
 the barrel into the pack. Immediately 
 groans were heard and blood flowed    
 from the pack, where a man had been   
 concealed. The three servants were    
 sure that an attack on the house would
 be made by the mans accomplices.      </content>
