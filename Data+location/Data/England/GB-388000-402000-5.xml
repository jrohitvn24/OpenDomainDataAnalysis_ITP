  St. John's Church, Werneth has not   
 changed since it was built in 1811.   
 Now it is being changed into a Youth  
 Training Centre because of all the    
 Asian people around there, who do not 
 go to church. The walls of the church 
 are strong and the council thought    
 that they could use the structure for 
 something useful for the people around
 that area.                            
   I myself think that the church      
 should not be changed. It is such a   
 nice church, with beautiful stained   
 glass windows and people should be    
 proud of it.
