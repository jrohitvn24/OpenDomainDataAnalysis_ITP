		<content>   The farmer's day has no set hours as
 the weather and the length of the day 
 decide what can be done.The farmer    
 told us about one day in July.        
   The day begins at{5 a.m.}First the  
 farmer has to check the irrigator and 
 move it to another part of the field. 
 After this, the animals are checked.  
 At{7.30}the farmer sets the men to    
 work and gives them their orders for  
 the day. After breakfast there is     
 office work to do and telephone calls 
 to be made.                           
   From{8 a.m.}to lunch everyone is    
 occupied lifting potatoes. from       
 lunchtime to teatime the sugar beet   
 must be weeded and the plants which   
 have run to seed  must be pulled out. 
   About{5 p.m.}the cattle feed is     
 checked.After tea, the irrigator      
 must be moved again.
