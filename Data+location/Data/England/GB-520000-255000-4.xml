		<title>04Farming in Abbotsley</title>
		<content> The house we live in is 400 to 500    
 years old.Life on a farm starts about 
 seven o'clock in the morning,we don't 
 have any breakfast as soon as we get  
 up because the cows,cattle and calves 
 need feeding and milking,my mum       
 does that by hand.We keep half the    
 milk for cooking and making butter.We 
 feed the cows and cattle on rolled    
 oats and barley,my dad also puts in   
 nuts.My dad and Uncle John muck out   
 the yard once a year.The muck is put  
 on the land to help the crops         
 grow.Farmers work seven days a week   
 and about twelve hours a day.The only 
 animals my dad has on the farm are    
 horses and Fresian and Hereford       
 cattle.We buy most of our calves from 
 Derbyshire.They are usually only one  
 week old and they are fed either on   
 a bucket,bottle or put on one of the  
 cows.         (Continued on page 5)   </content>
