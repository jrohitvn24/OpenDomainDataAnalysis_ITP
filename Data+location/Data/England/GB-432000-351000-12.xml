		<content> There are quite a lot of farms in our 
 area and one of them is Wiggonlea     
 Farm.It has 133 acres of land.50 acres
 is for silage,10 acres is for arable  
 crops,another 30 is for barley and 43 
 for pasture.Wiggonlea Farm had quite a
 few cows to go to market for meat.Lots
 of the farms aren't really farms at   
 all,infact some are deserted.Packhorse
 Farm is a cottage.In the 1800's       
 Packhorse Cottage kept gunpowder for  
 Crich quarry.The powder was taken     
 along the road by donkeys.That is how 
 Jackass Lane got its name.Round       
 Packhorse Cottage,all the fields      
 belong to different people.Some are   
 farmers,some are landowners,and some  
 just make money from the crops they   
 grow there.
