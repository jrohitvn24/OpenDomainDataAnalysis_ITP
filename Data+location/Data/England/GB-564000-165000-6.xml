		<content> There are two theatrical groups which 
 are called The Meopham Players and The
 Cobham Amateur Dramatic Society known 
 as CADS. The Meopham Players put on   
 three plays each year. Also every     
 other year The Meopham Players put on 
 a pantomime. People who are interested
 in dancing go to Gravesend. There are 
 no Morris Dancers in Meopham but      
 Morris Dancers do visit Meopham and   
 dance on the Green.  There is an Early
 Music Group but there are no longer   
 any choral groups.
