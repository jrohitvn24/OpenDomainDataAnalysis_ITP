		<title>08Shopping in the Rural Area</title>
		<content> After a lapse of 4 years the village  
 shop opened again 3 years ago and is  
 much appreciated.  It is well stocked 
 and run by a friendly concerned ex -  
 nurse;it is a meeting place           
 particularly as newspapers and        
 magazines are collected daily.The     
 business just pays for itself and the 
 prices are not high,but fortunately   
 the post office section is profitable 
 and anything which altered that would 
 have a detrimental effect on the whole
 community.                            
 There is also a travelling grocer,a   
 local greengrocer,butcher,a fresh fish
 van and 2 fish &amp; chip vans.Rington's  
 tea and the mobile library call       
 fortnightly.Nosterfield relies        
 entirely on these travelling shops.The
 nearest supermarkets are in Bedale and
 Ripon but Masham (4.5kms) has a useful
 range of shops.                       </content>
