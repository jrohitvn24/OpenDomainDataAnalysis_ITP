		<content> The Church of St Lawrence is situated 
 in the small parish of Folke and      
 serves  Alweston, Haydon, North       
 Wootton and Folke.  The church dates  
 from l29l but only the Tower of that  
 period remains - the remainder was    
 rebuilt in l628 and restored in l875. 
 The walls are of local rubble and free
 stone dressing and the roof is of     
 stone slates.  The interior is of     
 Gothic style.  Of the original five   
 bells in the tower two remain, one    
 cast in l628 and the other in l777. A 
 cross and chain hangs in the church   
 carved from one piece of limewood and 
 consisting of 769 links, carved by    
 Reverend Mayo Thornhill.  Regular     
 services are held at 8 a.m., ll a.m.  
 and 6.30 p.m. on alternate Sundays and
 Sunday School every Sunday morning.   
 The graveyard is full and burials take
 place at North Wootton.               </content>
