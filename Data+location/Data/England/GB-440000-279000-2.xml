		<title>02A BRINKLOW SCHOOL CHILDS DAY</title>
		<content> My cockerel crows in the morning and  
 wakes me up at 7 o'clock.My goats go  
 bananas because they want to get out  
 of their pen.I have golden porridge   
 for breakfast and after I've got      
 dressed I feed the animals,ducks,hens 
 and goats too.It's pretty hard because
 they keep butting me.I go to school   
 and read my book and then we have     
 assembly.After that I do my work and  
 then go out to play.I carry on with my
 work until dinner time and after the  
 last play Mrs.Bond reads us a story.I 
 go home and see if my snails are      
 alright then I change and go outside  
 to play.When it is dark I go to bed   
 with my little brother Joe and the    
 next morning I would say - another    
 hard day.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
