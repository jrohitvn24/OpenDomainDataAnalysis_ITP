		<title>02HOUSING IN ASTLEY BRIDGE</title>
		<content> Our area of Astley Bridge was once a  
 small village.Some of the area's      
 houses are well over a hundred years  
 old.Many of these are stone terraced  
 and were originally built to house the
 mill workers.                         
 Through the years the population of   
 Astley Bridge has grown;red brick     
 terraces have been built instead of   
 stone.New estates of semi-detached and
 detached houses have been built to    
 house the new population who work     
 further a field.There are three blocks
 of flats in our area,none of which are
 tower blocks.                         
 Some of the older houses have now been
 demolished, but no new houses have    
 been built on these sites. In fact the
 only new building work in  progress at
 the present time involves the building
 of old people's bungalows.
