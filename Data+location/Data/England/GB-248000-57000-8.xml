		<content> Poole Farm which belongs to Plymouth  
 City Council, covers 32 acres.  The   
 farmer also rents 146 adjoining acres 
 from the Property Services Agency. He 
 runs it as a commercial stock farm.   
 Casual labour is employed at harvest  
 time.  About 8O home bred pedigree    
 South Devon cattle are kept for beef  
 and about 12O in-lamb ewes are bought 
 in Autumn.  There are sufficient      
 out-buildings to over-winter most     
 animals under cover.  The farmer aims 
 to be self-sufficient in hay, silage  
 and kale, but buys barley and cattle  
 nuts.  He hires machinery to make     
 big-bale silage.  The farm is         
 surrounded by residential areas and it
 is used for military training so farm 
 animals are quite used to people but  
 trespassers do damage fences and      
 disturb wildlife.  At present there   
 are no plans to develop the land .    </content>
