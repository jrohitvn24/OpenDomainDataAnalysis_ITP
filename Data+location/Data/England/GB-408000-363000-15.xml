		<content>     At home we watch television.  I   
think that plays an important part.    
It's rather silly, I know, to depend on
a piece of machinery for entertainment.
                                       
     In Longnor there are quite a lot  
of activities.  On Mondays many young  
people go to the Youth Club at         
Warslow.  On a Tuesday there is a      
Young Farmers' Club.  Brownies are on  
another day and there are other        
community gatherings. The chip shop is 
open every night except Monday and     
Thursday.  There used to be occasional 
discos but they don't happen any more. 
                                       
     I play in the Warslow Silver      
Band. We go round pubs at weekends and 
sometimes I can't  do my homework.  We 
play hymns; my favourite is 'Thine be  
the glory'.
