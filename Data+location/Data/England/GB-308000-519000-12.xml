		<title>12LAMPLUGH CAMPING SITE.</title>
		<content> The Inglenook caravan and camping site
 has been running for 6 years. The site
 is run by 3 people their jobs are:    
 cleaning the toilets, taking bookings,
 working in the shop, doing repairs and
 clearing the rubbish from the site.   
 The shop sells food and drink. The    
 site closes from the 14th of November 
 to the 1st of March. The people that  
 run the site own 5 caravans that stay 
 there permanently. There are another  
 16 caravans that stay there           
 permanently but other people own them.
 If you are on holiday you can take    
 your own caravan or tent and stay at  
 the site. There were 5 caravans that  
 people had brought to the site when we
 were there. They had 180 people in    
 Whit week. More people caravan at the 
 site than camp. It is a popular site  
 and people who have been once often   
 come again.                           </content>
