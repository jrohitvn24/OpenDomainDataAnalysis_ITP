		<content> Rockland St.Mary started off as a     
 small,farming,brickmaking village.It  
 seemed way out in the country then,   
 when Norwich wasn't so big,but now it 
 is only a few miles away from the     
 outer suburbs of Norwich.The type of  
 housing is very mixed and there is a  
 great variety of age.However,most of  
 the houses were built in the early    
 1930's at the centre of the village   
 and the newer houses surround         
 them.This suggests the village started
 developing and enlarging after the    
 1930's.Even so,development of the     
 village can not be too extensive as   
 there has been a"Green Belt"order     
 placed upon the village ordering all  
 occupents not to build or extend      
 houses any further behind the street  
 than it is at the moment.In the       
 village there appears to be 2 age     
 groups,the young and the elderly.     </content>
