		<title>10The village of Lullington</title>
		<content>   Lullington is a small nucleated     
 village situated in the quiet rural   
 backwaters of S.Derbyshire. The 1981  
 census recorded a population of 123   
 but this figure was once much higher. 
 In 1851 there was a population of 303.
 In fact it was an estate village and  
 much of the present day structure is a
 result of the villagers dependence on 
 the employment provided by Lullington 
 Hall and its farms.                   
   Several of the buildings in         
 Lullington relate to it's history.    
 Lullington Hall stables were converted
 into an elegant detached house in     
 1967. Other buildings retain exterior 
 brickwork indicating their original   
 function. For example the blacksmith's
 and wheelwright's cottage. In fact it 
 appears to have been an almost self   
 sufficient village.
