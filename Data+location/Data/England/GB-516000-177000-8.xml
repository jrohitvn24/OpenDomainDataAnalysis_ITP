		<content> This is a new development of shops,   
 factories and warehouses on the Great 
 West Road where the Firestone factory 
 used to be. There is a large W.H.Smith
 "Do It All". Wang, Racal and Black and
 Decker have also moved in. The ware-  
 houses have their numbers in various  
 colours to show the different areas.  
 Yellow 6 is 50,000 square feet and the
 Bee Gees made a video in it. There is 
 also a squash club with six courts, a 
 public house &amp; a small shopping area.
