		<content>                                       
In and around Kettering there are about
50 Punks.  They are young people ( 16- 
20 yrs) who like loud music with lots  
of drum playing by groups like Sioux   
and Exploited.  Many dress in weird    
clothes, often black, which can be     
expensive leather or second hand.      
Kettering Punks go to Leicester or     
London for clothes.Hair is often black,
yellow,red or green, shaved at the     
sides and mostly sticks out from their 
heads.  They put soap on it, crimp it  
back comb, lacquer and gel the roots.  
Girls use bright stage make up. The    
Punk we interviewed said she likes     
being stared at.  Although she is      
clever there is no job for her.  It is 
not because of what she wears because  
at an interview she wears ordinary     
clothes and brushes her hair flat.
