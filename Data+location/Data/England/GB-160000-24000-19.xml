		<content> In Porthleven there are all kinds of  
 shops although it is a small village. 
 There are three butcher shops,.three  
 supermarkets, two chip shops and two  
 wet fish shops.                       
    We have two small corner shops, two
 newsagents, five gifts shops for      
 tourists and an angling centre, a     
 diving centre and a Chandlers. There  
 is also a pottery and a forge making  
 wrought iron gifts.                   
    We have several general stores, one
 baker's shop, one chemist and two     
 greengrocers. There is also a second  
 hand shop and two clothes shops, one  
 of which sells wool. We also have a   
 Handy Man's shop and a Building       
 Supplies Store.                       
    There is an Estate Agent, a Post   
 Office and two banks, Lloyds and      
 Barclays, which only open a few       
 mornings a week.                      </content>
