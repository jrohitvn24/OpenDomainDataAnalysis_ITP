		<content> Roydon Manor House was the Dower House
 of the Brockenhurst Manor Estate. The 
 Brockenhurst Manor House itself stood 
 in Brockenhurst Park from the middle  
 18th Century until it was demolished  
 in 1958 to be replaced by a modern    
 building in 1962.                     
     The owner of Roydon Manor House is
 Mr E.J.F.Morant whose family have been
 Lords of the Manor of Brockenhurst    
 (and of Ringwood) since l770. The     
 Brockenhurst Park estate was sold by  
 the Morant family in l959.            
     The farm attached to Roydon       
 comprises 280 acres and a further     
 170acres in the adjacent parish of    
 Boldre is rented. 90 head of beef     
 cattle are kept for which the         
 principal buyer is the local butcher. 
 The wheat and barley grown is chiefly 
 exported through the new grain dock at
 Southampton.                          </content>
