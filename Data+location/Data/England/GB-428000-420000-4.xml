		<title>04THE NEW PILOTS CLUB</title>
		<content> Pilots is the name of a club for      
 children.Pilots began in Mr.and Mrs.  
 Brandwood's extension.When it started 
 there were only 10 people in it.My    
 sister was one of those people.It     
 increased up to 35 people.They go on  
 camps,walks and play games.Now it is  
 held in a church in Wakefield called  
 Zion.When you join Pilots you get a   
 badge and a book.One Sunday you go out
 to the front  and say a promise.In    
 your book you have to do things like  
 help people and read parts from the   
 Bible.Sometimes you get a badge to say
 you have done it.The first test is to 
 read from the Bible.Its starts at 6:00
 pm to 8:00 pm or 9:00 pm for people   
 over 11 years old.I really have       
 enjoyed going to Pilots.
