		<content> In 1985 the management of Launde Park 
 Wood (803038) was taken over by the   
 Northants District of the Forestry    
 Commission. The wood had been         
 neglected and their intention is to   
 improve the quality of the timber.    
 The northern part was planted in the  
 1920's and now has too many trees with
 low quality stems. Thinning will be   
 needed in order to improve the quality
 of the ash and to bring it on to      
 decent timber.                        
 The southern part was planted in the  
 1960's with oak and conifer in the    
 same area, the idea being that the    
 conifers will mature first and be     
 removed leaving the oak to grow on    
 into good timber. The conifers in the 
 southern part are approaching maturity
 and should be felled. Small quantities
 of ash poles are removed from the wood
 for fencing.                          </content>
