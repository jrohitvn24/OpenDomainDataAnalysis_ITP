		<title>13FAMILY LIFE IN THEALE</title>
		<content> In our family my Dad gets up at 06:30,
 goes down stairs and has breakfast,   
 then gets into his car and goes to    
 work in London. At 07:00 my sister    
 gets up, has breakfast, makes her     
 sandwiches and feeds our animals. She 
 gets her books ready for school and   
 waits for friends to call for her and 
 leaves for school at 08:10. My Mum    
 gets up next. Finally I get up at     
 08:00, get my sandwiches and have my  
 breakfast. Then I get ready for school
 and leave at 08:35. My Dad is a       
 company secretary. My Mum is just a   
 housewife but also does upholstery and
 china restoration. My sister and I    
 come home from school at 15:30. My Dad
 finishes work at 18:00 and gets home  
 at 19:30. My sister and I go to bed at
 21:30 and my Mum and Dad go to bed at 
 23:00.
