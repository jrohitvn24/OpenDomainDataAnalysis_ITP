		<content>   The flat open areas of the fens may 
 at first appear to be inhospitable    
 places with their carefully laid out  
 fields and long straight roads.       
   However this is far from the case   
 the whole area abounds with wildlife  
 and fauna. The ditches and dykes are  
 refuge places for some of our rarest  
 plants and butterflies alongside the  
 common rushes and reeds.              
   The drains attract large numbers of 
 migrating birds including canada and  
 greylag geese, pintail and mallard    
 duck, and bewick swans.               
   In the water fish live in great     
 numbers, tench, carp, rudd, bream,    
 perch, pike, eels and a newcomer caus-
 ing some distress zander.             
   Occasionally otters can be seen and 
 some wild mink. Rabbits and hares are 
 common as are foxes although badgers  
 are sadly scarce.                     </content>
