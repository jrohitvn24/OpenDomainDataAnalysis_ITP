		<content> Employment within the whole of this   
area is mostly in the service          
industries with some in the primary    
industry of farming. Manufacturing     
industry is not much developed except  
in the area of High Brooms close to the
railway. Here a small industrial       
estate, the Haslemere Estate, has been 
built (and is still being expanded) in 
what was the quarry for the High Brooms
Brick and Tile Works which ceased      
production several years ago.          
 The factories include many engaged in 
printing, some light engineering, car  
servicing works, depots for oil storage
and parking areas for fleets of vans   
and lorries of local firms. There is   
also a large Cash and Carry and a shop 
selling building and decorating        
materials.  When we surveyed the area  
there were many empty buildings        
waiting for a buyer.                   </content>
