		<title>19TEESDALE FIELD COURSE</title>
		<content> Children from St Johns Chapel,        
 Rookhope and Frosterley schools went  
 on a field course to Middleton. All   
 together there were 26 children and   
 one teacher from each school. We      
 stayed from Monday 10th June to Friday
 14th June at Middleton Field Study    
 Center which was originally a school. 
 After breakfast we walked to places   
 such as Gibson's Cave, High Force and 
 Grassholme Reservoir .We had a packed 
 lunch and came back for tea.We were   
 then allowed a short time for         
 recreation before we had to copy up   
 the day's work in our diary. There    
 were three dormitories. For recreation
 we played rounders, football and      
 cricket. The teacher kicked the       
 ball in to the River Tees and we lost 
 it. Next year the schools will go to  
 Beamish Hall for their field course.
