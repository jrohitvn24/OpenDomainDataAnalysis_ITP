		<content> My first hobby is horse riding.I have 
 been greatly interested in animals    
 ever since I was little so when I was 
 nine I started riding.For my eleventh 
 birthday I was given a pony by my     
 parents.He is called Cider and is four
 years old.Since then Ihave learned a  
 great deal more and to be honest I    
 have fallen off a great deal more too.
  I go to Harlequin Studios in         
 Peacehaven where I do rock and        
 roll,disco and modern.I am in the rock
 and roll team which consists of nine  
 people and is called Harlequinade.I go
 to lessons three times a              
 week.Harlequinade has recently        
 represented England in Belgium where  
 we came first in the show dance teams.
  Every Friday we go to Guides where we
 do all sorts of interesting           
 things.                               
                                       </content>
