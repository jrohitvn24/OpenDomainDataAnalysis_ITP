		<title>16Visit to Withington Hospital</title>
		<content> On Tuesday 25th June a group of       
 fourteen children from our class went 
 on a visit to the hospital. We were   
 taken around the hospital by a Miss   
 June Isherwood, Personnel Officer.    
 We went to the old Workhouse Chapel   
 which is now used as a store, but it  
 will eventually be made into a        
 conference hall. The chapel, we       
 discovered, is a listed building which
 means that it is of historical value  
 and cannot be knocked down.           
 From the chapel we walked down the    
 main corridor of the hospital. It is  
 3/4 mile long. At the end was the     
 Maternity Unit where we met a Nursing 
 Officer called Mrs.Durkin. She        
 explained to us the daily role of a   
 nurse or midwife. She took us to the  
 Delivery Suite where we saw a baby    
 girl only ten minutes old. The father 
 told us his wife would call it Lyndsay</content>
