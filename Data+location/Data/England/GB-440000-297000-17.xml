		<title>17Legend of the White Lady.</title>
		<content> A long time ago,  a young girl,from   
 Daddlington,used to play and sing     
 around a well,which was in front of an
 old cottage. This angered the old lady
 who lived in the cottage. One day she 
 told the girl to drop a stone down the
 well and count how long it took to    
 reach the bottom. When the girl did   
 this,the old lady pushed her down the 
 well.                                 
     When the old lady died she was    
 buried in white clothing,and her white
 horse was also killed and buried with 
 her. The children of Dadlington are   
 still told this story. It is said that
 she haunts this area and has been     
 called the White Lady of Dadlington.  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
