		<content>{ FEELINGS ABOUT THE LOCALITY.}Based on
 the replies of ten parents of primary 
 school children to a questionaire.    
                                       
{LIKES.}Larger gardens, south facing   
 aspect, open spaces. Proximity to work
 place . Fast access to motorways,     
 areas of natural beauty and the       
 facilities of big cities. Living and  
 housing costs are reasonable. Friendly
 neighbours. Cheshire countryside.     
 Social and sports clubs.              
{                                      
{DISLIKES.}Bus service (half hourly and
 none after 6pm). The New Town.        
 Shopping City. Traffic. ICI and the   
 concentration of the chemical industry
 locally; sight and smell of factories 
 and their effect on the atmosphere.   
 Disappearance of beautiful countryside
 for factories and housing estates.
