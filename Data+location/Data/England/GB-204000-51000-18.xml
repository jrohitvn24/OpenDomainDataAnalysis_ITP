 farmer who lives in the area about his
 life.                                 
      A day in the life of Mr. George, 
 a farmer, begins at around 7:00am. by 
 him getting up. He then checks his    
 stock, and makes sure the troughs are 
 full. He eats breakfast at 9:15. Mr.  
 George is a part-time farmer; he is a 
 seed merchant and sells to farmers in 
 Mid-Cornwall. During the day, he      
 checks nhis vegetables, and hedges and
 ploughs his fields. Tired after the   
 days work, Mr. George retires to bed, 
 usually at about 11:00pm.             
       Mr. George is an arable farmer; 
 he has 12 bullocks. Grasses are the   
 main crops he grows on his farm, but  
 he also grows sweetcorn, leeks, winter
 cauliflowers, and cabbages.
