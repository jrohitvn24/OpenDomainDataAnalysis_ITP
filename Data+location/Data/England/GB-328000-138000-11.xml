		<content> About 850 pupils attend the Chilton   
 Trinity comprehensive school. We study
 a variety of subjects including       
 mathematics, sciences, English and    
 foreign languages, history, geography,
  music, crafts and physical           
 education.                            
 Pupils are often taught in 'sets'     
 according to their ability in a       
 particular subject.                   
 Some pupils travel up to ten miles to 
 attend our school.                    
 Midday meals are available in the     
 school canteen and many children bring
 home_made sandwiches.                 
 A Sports Hall is under construction   
 and will be opened in the autumn of   
 1986. This will add to the recreation 
 facilities available to the school and
 the local community. The cost of      
 building the Sports Hall approaches   
 Â£500,000.                             </content>
