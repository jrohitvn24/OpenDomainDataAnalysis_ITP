		<title>02THE COASTGUARD SERVICE</title>
		<content> Hornsea Coastguard covers the area of 
 sea and coast in our block. We went to
 see Coastguard Davies. He showed us   
 around the Lookout Station. Most of   
 his equipment for observation or      
 communication.When we were there we   
 heard over the radio from a coble in  
 trouble off Filey Brig.Its propeller  
 had dropped off.The Filey Inshore     
 Rescue Boat had gone to tow it back to
 safety. Mrs.Knapp,an Auxilliary Coast 
 Guard came to school to tell us about 
 her work. Many accidents are caused by
 holidaymakers who don't know the      
 dangers here.Often they are blown out 
 to sea on air-beds or else they try to
 use inflatable dinghies which are not 
 safe.She showed us the Rescue Land    
 Rover which was full of all kinds of  
 rescue apparatus. The Coastguard can  
 send for Lifeboats and even the Rescue
 Helicopters from Leconfield. M.Baker  </content>
