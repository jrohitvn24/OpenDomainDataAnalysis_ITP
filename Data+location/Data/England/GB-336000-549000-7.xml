		<title>07Why people move to Dalston</title>
		<content> We have done a survey to find out how 
 many people moved out of all of the   
 juniors in our school There were 37   
 juniors in our school that moved to   
 Dalston and there are 92 juniors in   
 the whole of our school . The main    
 reason why they moved was because of  
 their father's job and there were 16  
 giving that reason altogether The     
 second reason was because they wanted 
 bigger houses, 4 people moved to      
 Dalston because they wanted better    
 houses, 3 people moved because they   
 liked the school and 2 people moved   
 because of family health, 1 person    
 wanted to move because of their       
 mum's job and 1 person moved because  
 they wanted to be near some friends.
