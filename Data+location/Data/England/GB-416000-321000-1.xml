		<title>01Rangemore District Survey</title>
		<content>   The area I live in is quite rural   
 with some scattered farms and a small 
 village called{Rangemore.}The land is 
 undulating with a few small ponds and 
 lakes amid the fields and woods.      
   Two main roads cross the area. One  
 runs north to south, and it is joined 
 by another, from{Tatenhill,}in the    
 east.                                 
   There are two estates in the area,  
{Rangemore Park}and{Byrkley Park.}A    
 large country house,{Rangemore Hall,} 
 is in the centre. It was once the home
 of{Lord Burton,}but in 1954 was opened
 by Staffs County Council as the       
{Needwood School for Partially Hearing 
{Children.}                            
   In Rangemore there is a{primary     
{school, church, shop and post office, 
{club, hotel}and{recreation field.     
   There is also a small{chocolate     
{factory}amidst this farming community.</content>
