		<title>12RECREATION AT SOUTHSEA</title>
		<content>    In the summer there are a lot of   
 elderly people who like to stroll     
 along the beach or sit and watch the  
 sea.   We spoke to several joggers who
 said they were keeping fit.{Metal     
{detecting}is also a pastime.(It seems 
 that after storms, valuables such as  
 rings and coins are uncovered and     
 washed up on the beach.)              
  { Fishing}appears to be popular on   
 the pier(allowed from May-October)and 
 along the beach we saw swimmers,small 
 fishing boats,sailing and paddle      
 boats.(The last are worked by the feet
 like a bicycle.){Windsurfing}(using a 
 sail on a surfboard) is popular       
 between South Parade Pier and Eastney 
 Barracks.    Many people we spoke to  
 had come from other parts of          
 England(the big cities particularly)  
 and from other countries such as      
 France, Italy and America.            </content>
