		<content>{North Street}leading to  our school   
 is a terraced street of 31 houses.    
 Arkwright and Strutt, needing housing 
 for their mill labour built it between
 1771 and 1780.Houses are liked by     
 their occupants for their thick walls,
 friendly atmosphere and proximity to  
 schools and shops.Its a good street   
 for children to play on as it is a    
 dead_end leading to a field.People    
 don't like the hordes of tourists     
 "gawping" in their windows.They also  
 would prefer not to see houses on the 
 other side of the street.But the thing
 they disliked most was no outside     
 alterations are allowed in a          
 conservation area,though many have    
 made internal alterations.Most houses 
 now contain an upstairs  bathroom, 3  
 bedrooms, kichen, lounge.Some now have
 toilets down stairs.
