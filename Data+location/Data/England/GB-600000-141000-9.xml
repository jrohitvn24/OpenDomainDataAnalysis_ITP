		<content>From an 11 year old boy:               
'Computers are one of my favourite     
occupations whilst I have nothing else 
to do. I read a lot of books of all    
kinds and play many board games such   
as Chess, Monopoly, Subbutteo (a foot  
ball game), Battleships, Dover Harbour 
and many more. I  play football,cricket
tennis and other games in the garden   
with my brother. I like to ride my     
bicycle a lot. I enjoy electronic games
such as Astro Wars, Munchman, Crazy    
Kong and Frogger. I also like to play  
my Space Invader game on my watch'.    
It is perhaps only in the past 20 years
that electronics have affected every   
home. Putting the first man on the moon
back in 1969 has had even greater      
effect than that first thought of.     
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
