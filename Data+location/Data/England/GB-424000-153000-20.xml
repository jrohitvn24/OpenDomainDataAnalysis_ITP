 Saxon Rise- the name was given to this
 area  because when the foundations of 
 the houses were being dug the workmen 
 came across a number of Saxon graves. 
 The remains and artefacts are now in  
 Devizes museum.                       
 Mill Lane- this lane down to the      
 possible site of the mill which served
 the village in Saxon times.           
 Penny Hill- the hill leading to the   
 church. On the green here the custom  
 of Bun and Penny was maintained until 
 it went to Court Farm.                
 Sunton- this is a corruption of       
 Southtown. Originally Sunton was the  
 southern part of Collingbourn Kingston
 and children living there had to go to
 school in Kingston.
