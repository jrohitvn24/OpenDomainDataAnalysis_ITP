 population are{retired people}and     
 therefore elderly.There are many small
 areas that make up Braunton including 
{Wrafton,Velator and Saunton.}All have 
 large housing estates.Around the      
 village there is a lot of{beautiful   
{countryside}and this is one of the    
 main reasons Braunton is popular.The  
 majority of people have average size  
 houses,cars and pets-these include    
 dogs,cats,rabbits,hamsters,and        
 tortoises.A lot of people who reside  
 in this area live on their own, and   
 don't have any family in Braunton.The 
 local population,although friendly,   
 tend to avoid tourists,a minority of  
 whom spoil the local area with both   
 litter and at times,noise.
