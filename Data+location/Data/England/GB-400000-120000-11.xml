		<title>11HORSE BREEDING: BOWERCHALKE</title>
		<content> Race horses are bred for flat racing  
 BREEDS - Blonde Aquitaine. Five mares 
 go away for foaling and serving and   
 return pregnant. Horses remain until  
 old enough to train, then they go     
 elsewhere. They can be seen being led 
 around lanes &amp; bridle ways, as they   
 approach 2 years old. After their     
 racing career, males are sold and     
 fillies are retained for breeding.    
 One of the enjoyable activities       
 associated with the rearing, is       
 visiting race meetings where the      
 horses are running, sometimes as often
 as 3 times a week. Their performance  
 is keenly watched.
