		<content>  Once I was going up the stairs at my 
 Nan's house.When I got to the top I   
 walked across the landing.Then I      
 heard the same noise that I did when I
 walked up the stairs.It was coming    
 from the attic.                       
  So I walked down the stairs,I stood  
 at the bottom and listened for        
 something.Then I heard the same       
 noise.It was coming from the attic    
 again.So I opened the door and ran    
 very fast through the living room then
 through the kitchen and outside.      
  My nans house is about 150 years old 
 and used to be a pub called 'The Bell'
 .Quite a lot of people have heard it  
 and seen it.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
