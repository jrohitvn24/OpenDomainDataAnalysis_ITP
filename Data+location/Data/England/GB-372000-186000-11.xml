		<content>    WHEN I COME HOME FROM SCHOOL,I     
 CHANGE INTO MY OLD CLOTHES AND GO AND 
 PLAY IN THE GARDEN FOR ABOUT HALF AN  
 HOUR.I USUALLY PLAY ON MY BIKE OR PLAY
 ON THE SWING,AND THEN GO AND GET SOME 
 THING TO EAT.THEN WE MIGHT DECIDE TO  
 GO FOR A RIDE ON OUR BIKES WITH MY    
 MUM AND DAD.WE SERVICE OUR  BIKES     
 BEFORE GOING OUT,OUR  FAVOURITE PLACE 
 ISA TRAIN BRIDGE IT'S NOT VERY WIDE   
 NO WIDER THAN THE LENGTH OF ME.IT'S   
 QUITE NEAR A TUNNEL SO WE WATCH THE   
 TRAINS COMING OUT AND GET THEM TO BLOW
 THEIR HORNS,THEY USUALLY DO.WE STAY   
 THERE FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR TO AN    
 HOUR.                                 
    THEN WE GO BACK HOME AND HAVE A    
 REST AND THEN WE MIGHT GO OUT IN THE  
 CAR AND FIND A FOOTPATH OR A WOOD AND 
 GO FOR A WALK OR JUST RIDE AROUND IN  
 THE CAR.AFTER THAT WE'D COME HOME AND 
 HAVE TEA.                             </content>
