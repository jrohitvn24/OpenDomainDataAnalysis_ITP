		<title>05Typical farm,north Upottery.</title>
		<content>   A working farmer,whose land lies in 
 the middle of the valley area,says    
 that his farm carries 60 cows,mostly  
 Friesians with a few Ayrshires.He     
 reckons to produce about 260 litres at
 each milking,which is collected for   
 the Milk Marketing Board and taken to 
 Chard in the blue tankers we see often
 in our lanes.                         
   He also keeps 10 sows,whose piglets 
 he sells when they are about 10 weeks 
 old,together with any calves,in the   
 markets at either Honiton,Axminster or
 Taunton.                              
   In the winter he buys in 50 sheep   
 from Scotland for fattening.          
   Poultry he keeps only for the family
 table.
