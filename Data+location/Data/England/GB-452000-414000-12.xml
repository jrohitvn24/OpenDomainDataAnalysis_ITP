		<title>12NOTABLE EVENTS.</title>
		<content>   Two events of significance are      
 worthy of record for the year 1985.   
{END OF MINER'S STRIKE.                
   The strike,fought on the issue of   
 pit closures,came to end in March.    
 Much hardship was endured bythe mining
 families,but,in this area brought the 
 mining community closer together. One 
 notable feature was the degree of     
 support given to the miners by their  
 wives and families,especially here by 
 the Campsall,Askern and Norton Women's
 Support Group who organised soup      
 kitchens,Xmas parties,fund raising    
 activites etc,.Support for the hard   
 pressed families also came from the   
 Parish Council and from the Borough   
 Council who provided free meals for   
 children so entitled both during term 
 time and during the school holidays.
