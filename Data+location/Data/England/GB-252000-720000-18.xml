		<title>18OUR PIG FARM - BALQUHIDDER</title>
		<content> I live on a pig farm with 5 acres of  
 land. We go by the name of Matyjasek  
 and son and we employ one worker who  
 has been with us for a very long time.
 Mr Matyjasek senior originally came   
 from Poland and is now retired. We've 
 roughly 100 pigs, all Landrace. They  
 are kept in sties in a large building 
 with a pipeline to feed them. We also 
 have a farrowing house where pregnant 
 pigs are taken to give birth. A sow   
 can normally have up to 15 babies.    
 During the next 6 months we fatten up 
 these piglets and they go to the      
 slaughterhouse for pork. They usually 
 go to the slaughterhouse at Gorgie in 
 Edinburgh but sometimes they go to    
 Dunblane and Glasgow. We fatten them  
 with a special type of pellets &amp; swill
 which we collect from lots of places  
 in our Bedford lorry. One of the most 
 interesting places is Perth Prison.   </content>
