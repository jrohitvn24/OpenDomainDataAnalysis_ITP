		<content>   A secondary school pupil writes: I  
 use the 146 bus from Keston to Hayes. 
 This single-decker bus runs from Downe
 to Bromley North station. Routes 119  
 and 138 which also run through Hayes  
 are served by double-deckers, the 138 
 has recently returned to a            
 double-decker.  The 119 was until     
 recently an open-backed bus with a    
 conductor who collected the fares.    
 The new buses have two doors, the     
 passengers get on at the front,pay the
 driver and get off at the centre      
 doors. The 146 runs infrequently as   
 there are not many passengers. A      
 private company is to start operating 
 the service soon.                     
   There are few taxis in this area as 
 the public transport is good enough   
 and many own cars. Hayes people use   
 three rail stations: Hayes, West      
 Wickham and Bromley South.            </content>
