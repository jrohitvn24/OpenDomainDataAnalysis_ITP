{          }There are two return bus   
 routes through our block going from   
 Stiperstones to Shrewsbury and        
 Bishop's Castle to Shrewsbury. From   
 Bishop's Castle to Shrewsbury there   
 are six buses in and seven buses out  
 on week days. On Saturdays there are  
 seven in and six out and on Sundays,  
 four each way. From Stiperstones to   
 Shrewsbury there are four in and five 
 out, taking about forty minutes each. 
{AMBULANCE SERVICE.                    
 If there was an emergency, it would   
 take an ambulance 25-30 minutes to    
 get from the station in Shrewsbury to 
 Snailbeach. They have 73 ambulances.  
{THE FIRE SERVICE.                     
 Our nearest fire station is at Worthen
 , roughly 7 miles from our school.    
 It would take roughly fifteen minutes 
 to get from Worthen to Snailbeach.    </content>
