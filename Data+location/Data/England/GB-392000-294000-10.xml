courts. A wide variety of indoor games 
are played; badminton, basketball,     
volleyball, netball, tennis, table-    
tennis, five-a-side soccer and roller  
skating. On weekdays the centre is used
by schools between 9-00a.m. and 6-00   
p.m. From 7-00p.m. to 10-00p.m.,and    
Saturday afternoons, &amp; Sunday mornings,
it is available for use by the general 
public either as clubs or individually.
During school holidays recreational    
courses are organised for children,    
adults and families. It is possible to 
hire some sports equipment and the     
centre is well booked. Interestingly it
is people who live outside the area who
use most the facilities offered.       </content>
