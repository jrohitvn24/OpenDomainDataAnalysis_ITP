		<title>12Police and Crime in Shelford</title>
		<content> In the Shelford Police force there are
 two plain clothed policemen and three 
 detectives.There are also two         
 uniformed policemen.Everyday one      
 policeman patrols eleven villages.Two 
 policemen work on an eight hour shift.
 The most common crimes in Shelford are
 assaults and theft.When the policemen 
 are on patrol they carry no           
 weapons.The more professional burglers
 operate during the day.Most fines in  
 Shelford are accidents not arson.One  
 case of arson was when a bus shelter  
 was burnt down.The main age range for 
 these crimes are eleven to            
 seventeen.The area had a wave of glue 
 sniffing.Therefore shops will not sell
 glue to the children,unless they have 
 a note from their parents,or they are 
 over eighteen.Alot of bikes go missing
 as well as cars.There is generally no 
 vandalism.                            </content>
