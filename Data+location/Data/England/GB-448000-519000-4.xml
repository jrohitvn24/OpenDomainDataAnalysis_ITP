		<title>04HOW THE TOWN HAS CHANGED</title>
		<content>    Middlesbrough has changed a lot    
 since 1830. The population has risen  
 considerably, an the town has moved   
 outwards to house all the people.     
 A new, bigger town hall has been      
 built. The council first built lots of
 houses near the town. When even more  
 people came they had to knock the     
 houses down to build shops.           
    There are three main shopping      
 arcades now. Transport has changed a  
 lot. There are now deisel trains that 
 can go very fast.Toll booths that used
 to be on many of the towns roads have 
 now been abolished, and more and more 
 people own cars.There is a big, new   
 bus station too.
