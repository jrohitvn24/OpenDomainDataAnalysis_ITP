   At the end of the second world war, 
Cliffe was a small community of        
about l,OOO people, built around St.   
Helen's Church. Thatcher's Lane at the 
far end of the village received its    
name from a small farm that used to be 
situated there.  At Norwood Corner     
there was a cinema which the local     
people called 'The Globe' but this was 
closed and pulled down.  The Co-op,    
which you can still see, used to have  
a bakery, but it has closed now.       
Further up Church Street there was the 
Methodist Church. It closed down in    
l973 . During the post war period      
there have been several different      
shops in  the village including a      
group called the Cliffe Market. There  
was a train station on the outskirts   
of Cliffe which closed in l96l.        </content>
