 Oxhill Torrent whilst Whatcote lies   
 close to Wynyates Brook. Whatcote has 
 three remaining ponds,the largest     
 called Wellpool was cleared in 1983,  
 another was the Wheelwrights pond, the
 third behind the church is very old.  
 Oxhill has several Hornton stone      
 houses remaining,two with thatched    
 roofs, whilst Whatcote has 8 original{
 Blue Lyas or Hornton Stone houses left
 but has 9 modern rebuilt or barn      
 conversions.The remainder are brick.  
 About 70% of the trees were elms all  
 killed by {Dutch Elm Disease}leaving  
 the lowland areas relatively bare.All 
 of the roads are based on{Drove Roads}
 with wide grass verges which are a    
 mass of wild flowers in spring and    
 summer if left uncut.
