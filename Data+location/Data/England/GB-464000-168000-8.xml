		<title>08TRANSPORT - BURGHFIELD</title>
		<content> Quite a few people use cycles.  Some  
 people are doing their cycling        
 proficiency badge.  There is only one 
 bus service in the area we are working
 in.  Most people have got cars:  not  
 many people use public transport.     
 There is a bus stop near the triangle.
  There are no Garages where you can   
 buy cars in our area.  Some people    
 hire minibuses like Burghfield taxis. 
 Bikes are very useful for going around
 Burghfield.  A lot of people have got 
 two cars.  Theale railway station is  
 also used a lot for transport because 
 it is the only station in the area.   
 There is also the M4 which leads to   
 South Wales or London.
