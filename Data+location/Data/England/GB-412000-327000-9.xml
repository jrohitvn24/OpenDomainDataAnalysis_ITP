		<content> The upper ground above the woods was  
 forested until the mid 19th century,  
 so most of the farms there are        
 relatively recent. Many of these      
 buildings have their date of          
 construction highlighted in           
 contrasting bricks on their walls. It 
 is noticeable that the roads and field
 boundaries in this part of the area   
 are very straight.                    
                                       
 In the centre of the village there is 
 a spring known as The Fountain which  
 bears the inscription:{               
{  WHILE COOLER WATERS HERE YE DRINK   
{  REST NOT YOUR THOUGHTS BELOW        
{  LOOK TO THE SACRED SIGN AND THINK   
{  WHENCE LIVING WATERS FLOW           
 More recently a new sign has been     
 posted by the medical officer for     
 Uttoxeter Rural District Council:     
{  THIS WATER IS UNFIT FOR DRINKING    </content>
