		<content> In Whiteparish common the bird that is
 most famous is the Nightingale.The    
 Nightingale sings as much in the day  
 as night.The Nightingale is a woodland
 bird,the cock birds arrive from Africa
 in mid April and they are the singers,
 the Female birds arrive ten days      
 later.The nightingale's song is easily
 recognised in the woods.One of the    
 Nightingale's notes is deep and       
 another is a drawn out note.The       
 Nightingale is not an easy bird to    
 see. It conceals itself in the        
 undergrowth and builds it's nest in   
 the leaves and grasses on the ground. 
 The mothers can be aggressive in      
 defence of it's young.                
 Other birds that we have seen in our  
 area are the Lapwing,the Heron and the
 Kingfisher.
