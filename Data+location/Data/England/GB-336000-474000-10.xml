		<title>10The Sandguide</title>
		<content>   Cedric Robinson has a unique job-he 
 is the official guide for Kent Sands, 
 on the northern side of Morecambe Bay.
   The Sandguide is a traditional post,
 given to somebody who has a special   
 knowledge of the treacherous and ever-
 changing sands. The job is to guide   
 parties over the sands, along a 'path'
 linking Kents Bank with Arnside.This  
 route was used by coaches many years  
 ago and recently Cedric guided a party
 of horse drawn coaches led by Prince  
 Philip.In summer Cedric takes many    
 groups of walkers.                    
   Cedric comes from along line of     
 fishermen and still follows this work 
 at times. He lives in a humble cottage
 near the shore,where his wife breeds  
 Chihuahua dogs.Cedric has written two 
 books about his lifestyle and has been
 featured in television programmes.
