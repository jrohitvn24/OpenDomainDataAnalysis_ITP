		<content> There are several ghostly manifesta-  
 tions in the area. Monmouth is the    
 highest ranked. His carriage and      
 outriders are to be seen by the       
 Friends' Meeting House. Amongst sev-  
 eral houses haunted are Manor House   
 Farm which has a rather nice young man
 who visits. An unnamed house has two  
 ghosts. One, a little old lady who    
 tucks the children up, and the other a
 rather unpleasant man who whispers. To
 the East of Load Bridge, many people  
 have heard the sounds of fighting and 
 dying men. Many attribute these sounds
 to the Civil War, but they could      
 easily be a hang-over from the Roman  
 occupation, or even the Spanish       
 Armada. A large black dog haunts Wet  
 and Dry Crouds, disappearing after    
 crossing Littlefields lane.
