		<title>09SANDFORD SCHOOL: AMENITIES</title>
		<content>  The school provides a number of      
 extra-curricula facilities. For sport 
 they have playing fields and tennis   
 courts. They have had an Olympic      
 high-jumper and a tennis player who   
 played at Wimbledon.                  
  For art they have two rooms, a       
 specialist art room and a pottery     
 room. For science their own fully     
 equiped laboratory.                   
  They do drama but have no stage or   
 lighting facility. For technical      
 studies they have a woodwork room and 
 a design room.                        
  The school has a formal timetable,   
 however it is very flexible and can be
 altered by the teacher depending upon 
 the situation.                        
  The school is designed and run so    
 that the pupils when they leave it    
 will have the same prospects as       
 children from any other school.       </content>
