		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO OUR BLOCK</title>
		<content>This block,on the outskirts of         
Ashford, is primarily a farming        
area.The undulating landscape contains 
a large proportion of the Hinxhill     
Estate and the Mersham Hatch Estate,   
the latter being owned by the          
Brabourne family.A part of Hatch Park  
falls within this block,and this       
amenity is enjoyed by the children     
looked after by the Caldecott          
Community.12.39 hectares of the        
Houchin Estate was sold to the South   
Eastern Area Health Authority for the  
site of the William Harvey Hospital.   
The population of this block is low,   
comprising one village- Hinxhill-with  
only 17 houses and a church. The area  
of greatest density is The Street,     
Willesborough. Over the rest of the    
area housing is scattered dwellings    
attached to farms.Communications are   
along narrow country lanes.            </content>
