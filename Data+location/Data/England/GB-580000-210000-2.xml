		<content> The area being largely agricultural   
 land is home to much wildlife.        
 Evidence of the existence of fox,     
 rabbit, deer, squirrel and hare is    
 abundant. The River Blackwater ensures
 the existence of fish such as tench   
 and perch and water creatures such as 
 rat. The birds observed include crow, 
 blackbird, robin, cuckoo, pigeon and  
 migrating birds such as swallow, swift
 and martin. The climate of Essex is   
 fairly dry with cold east winds.      
 Reservoirs to conserve rainwater for  
 irrigation of crops also attract      
 birdlife. The footpaths marked on the 
 O.S. map are recognisable but often   
 overgrown. Pollution from the trunk   
 road to the north is minimal but the  
 regular spraying of crops is of       
 concern to conservationists. Trees in 
 the area include oak, willow, beech,  
 sycamore, poplar, ash and fir.        </content>
