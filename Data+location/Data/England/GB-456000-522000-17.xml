		<content> 54 old people live in wheatacres      
 permanently,30 people in day care.The 
 problems they face are ill health and 
 shortage of money.They've got 3 cooks,
 3 kitchen assistants,4 domestics,     
 6 night staff ,12 care attendants and 
 1 temporary.These are all staff they  
 have.all of the staff enjoy working   
 there but have some trouble with diff-
 icult people.                         
 There are 50 rooms in the building and
 1 self-contained 3 bedroom flat.      
 They have a set meal but the fussy    
 ones can have different things.For    
 supper they have tea and biscuits.They
 have a few nights with entertainment  
 with a choir singing and a man plays  
 the piano.If they could change the    
 building they would make it on 1 level
 so there wasn't any stairs.They have  
 enough old people as it is.They occasi
 nally go on trips around the area.    </content>
