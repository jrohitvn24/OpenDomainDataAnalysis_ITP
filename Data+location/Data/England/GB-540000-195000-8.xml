		<content>  Within the total forest area of 6,000
 acres there are four main varieties of
{trees:}oak, hornbeam, beech and birch.
 It was a{Royal Forest}until 1882 when 
 there were many deer in it. But now   
 with the pressure of the modern       
 society on it the few surviving{red   
{deer}have to be protected in special  
 areas.                                
  Many years ago rich landowners tried 
 to{enclose}large areas of the forest  
 for themselves. This meant that the   
 local people could not lop the trees  
 for firewood. Many people fought      
 against this, including Thomas        
 Willingale. The trees could be lopped 
 at head height{(pollarding)}or at     
 ground level{(coppicing).             
  There are many{ponds}within the      
 forest, the largest of which is       
 Connaught Waters named after Lord     
 Connaught, a nephew of Queen Victoria.</content>
