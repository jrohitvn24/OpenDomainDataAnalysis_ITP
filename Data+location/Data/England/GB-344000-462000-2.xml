		<content> Morecambe began to grow as a holiday  
 resort in the mid 19th century and    
 reached its peak in the 1950's. Its   
 popularity has waned since then       
 because of the growth in foreign      
 package holidays. Despite this it     
 still offers much and is particularly 
 popular with Scottish visitors. In    
 addition to the usual seaside         
 attractions it has many unique        
{attractions. One is the multi million 
{pound Leisure Centre. Others include  
{the sunsets and spectacular views     
{across the Bay to the Lakeland Hills. 
 The season is short but in an attempt 
{to extend it the illuminations go on  
 in mid-August until early October. The
 carnival is staged early season and a 
{Folklore Festival in August.          
 Unfortunately if the weather is wet   
 then there is very little indoor      
 entertainment.                        </content>
