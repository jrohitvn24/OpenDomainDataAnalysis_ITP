		<title>10Samares Manor</title>
		<content>{Samares Manor}is an old Manor house in
 the parish of St.Clement; nowadays it 
 is a tourist attraction. Samares Manor
 is the home of the Obbard family; it  
 is surrounded by a small park and farm
 land. The house is private but the    
 grounds are open to the public.       
{Samares Manor has the ancient right to
{the reef south of Jersey called the   
{Minquiers.}There is a small island    
 called{Maitresse Isle}which has on it 
 a number of fishermen's huts. At low  
 tide many rocks are exposed and it is 
 a good place for low water fishing. In
 the past if anything was washed ashore
 on the Minquiers it would go to       
 Samares Manor, that was the law and   
 that is why the Minquiers are a part  
 of Jersey. The French have challenged 
 this ancient right but the{           
{International Court at the Hague}ruled
 in Britain's favour in this dispute.  </content>
