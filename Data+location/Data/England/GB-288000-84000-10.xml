		<content> KENNFORD IS A STREET VILLAGE, A FINE  
 EXAMPLE OF HOW A ROUTE CAN DICTATE A  
 SITE. IT IS SITUATED ON THE ROUTE OF  
 THE OLD EXETER TO TORQUAY ROAD. THIS  
 WAS BYPASSED IN 1931 AND THIS BYPASS  
 FURTHER BYPASSED IN THE LATE 1970S.THE
 ROAD USED TO BE THE SCENE OF LONG     
 TRAFFIC QUEUES IN THE 1960S EACH      
 SUMMER SATURDAY AS HOLIDAYMAKERS      
 HEADED FOR HOME USING THE EXETER      
 BYPASS. WITH THE COMING OF THE        
 MOTORWAY TRAFFIC NOW SPEEDS BY AT     
 70MPH. AT THE BOTTOM OF HALDON HILL , 
 THE A38 HAS AGAIN BEEN BYPASSED       
 LEAVING AN OLD TOLL HOUSE DATING TO   
 AROUND 1870. THE A38 AND THE A380 FORM
 THE TWO MAJOR HIGHWAYS IN THE AREA    
 CARRYING ALL FORMS OF ROAD TRANSPORT. 
 TRAFFIC IS ALWAYS HEAVIEST IN THE     
 SUMMER WHEN THE TOURIST INDUSTRY IS IN
 FULL SWING.                           
                                       </content>
