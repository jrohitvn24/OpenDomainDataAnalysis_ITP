		<title>11DRAYTON BASSETT VILLAGE</title>
		<content>-The village of Drayton Bassett        
 (o.s. 1900) contains 245 houses and   
711 people.  The village centre around 
the green contains the parish church   
of St. Peter, the village school       
(built 1905) with 40 pupils on roll,   
and the General Stores/Post Office.    
The village has few amenities: a       
workingmen's club, the Womens Institute
hall, one public telephone box, a small
recreation/park area and visits from   
the mobile library.  The houses in the 
centre are the oldest in the village.  
Moving outwards (N.and E.) the houses  
are more widespread, these areas being 
expensive Birmingham computer-belt     
property.  Further out there is arable 
farmland and woodland.  The village has
expanded greatly in the last 20 years  
and future development is planed (75   
private houses behind the church)      
despite some local opposition.         </content>
