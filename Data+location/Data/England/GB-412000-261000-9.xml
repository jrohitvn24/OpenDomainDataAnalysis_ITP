		<title>09A SCHOOLDAY - Wootton Wawen</title>
		<content>      I am Anna Jarmy, a girl living at
 Mappleborough Green, five miles from  
 Wootton.  One Friday morning I got up 
 and dressed.  I went down to breakfast
 for which my brother Timothy and I had
 cornflakes and toast.                 
     We went to school by car, arriving
 before 9 a.m. We first went swimming  
 and then started class lessons at 10  
 a.m. We had to write out and learn    
 our weekly spellings. After play we   
 had Mathematics, at which I am good,  
 and at noon I had to forecast the     
 weather. I studied the temperature,   
 the type and amount of cloud, the wind
 and air pressure. Then I used the     
 computer to make a forecast.          
     After dinner at school we had an  
 English lesson, followed by Art and   
 Craft. At 3.30, school ended.  We said
 a prayer, said good-bye to everyone   
 and went home.                        </content>
