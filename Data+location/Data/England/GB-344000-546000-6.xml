 BARROWLING FARM                       
                                       
 The workers on the farm are J. and R. 
 Fiddler, who have worked on the farm  
 for 27 years. The farm was built in   
 1600. The workers are self employed   
 and earn an average wage. For farm    
 work they need skill but              
 qualifications are not all that       
 necessary. They work ten hours per day
 and therefore are not left with much  
 leisure time. The jobs they do on the 
 farm vary from the milking of the     
 cattle to general farm working. On    
 Barrowling Farm there are 160 cows, 35
 acres of barley and 125 acres of grass
 which is used for silage, hay and     
 grazing.
