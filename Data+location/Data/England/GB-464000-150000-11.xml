		<title>11Travelling in Basingstoke</title>
		<content>{ Travelling around Basingstoke}is an  
 awkward thing because there is so much
{traffic}and so many{roundabouts.}The  
 M3 Spur Road joins the Ring Road at   
{Blackdam Roundabout.}We counted about 
 1680 vehicles going round it in one   
 hour.When there is a{traffic jam}you  
 just have to sit in the car and wait  
 for your turn to move. Then when it's 
 your turn to move you move quite      
 slowly. When there is no traffic jam  
 the cars go whizzing round there.There
 are up to 450{accidents}yearly,bad    
 ones too.Sometimes they are just minor
 ones but they all cause alot of       
 trouble like dents in your car,people 
 dead and hurt and sometimes even with 
 brain damage. It is dangerous to cross
 the{Ring Road}and you could easily be 
 knocked over.There are several{subways
 and{foot-bridges}around Basingstoke.
