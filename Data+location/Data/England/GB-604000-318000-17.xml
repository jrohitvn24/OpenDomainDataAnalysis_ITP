		<title>17Sparham Church</title>
		<content> The 15'th century tower of St. Mary's 
 church is a landmark in the Wensum    
 valley. Sparham is one of four        
 parishes in the care of one rector,   
 the others being Elsing, Bylaugh and  
 Lyng where the modern rectory is      
 situated. Church and village news is  
 circulated through the four parishes  
 by the duplicated magazine "Hill and  
 Vale" (Sparham on the hill, the others
 in the valley)                        
 A growing interest in campanology has 
 led to the revival of bell ringing in 
 Sparham where the three bells, cast in
 1726, were rung again for the 1985    
 Harvest Festival. Future hopes are    
 that 2 lighter bells will be found to 
 replace those sold in 1776 to make a  
 complete ring of 5 again and an upper 
 floor will be installed in the tower  
 to facilitate ringing and encourage   
 more Sparham folk to take up this art </content>
