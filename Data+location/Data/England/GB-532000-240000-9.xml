		<title>09Therfield Heath</title>
		<content> Royston Heath is an area of grassland 
 to the south-west of Royston. It is   
 really called Therfield Heath because 
 most of it is in the parish of        
 Therfield. It has been used for many  
 different things. King James 1 liked  
 to hunt hares and birds there. Later  
 there was a racecourse on the Heath   
 which was more popular than           
 Newmarket,and it has always been used 
 for grazing sheep.                    
   Now the Heath is used for all sorts 
 of games: football, cricket, rugby,   
 tennis, shooting and golf.  There is a
 sports club and a golf club. In winter
 many people go sledging on the Heath. 
 In summer it is good for having walks 
 and picnics.                          
   It is very important that we should 
 preserve the Heath. It is very        
 important to the people of Royston.
