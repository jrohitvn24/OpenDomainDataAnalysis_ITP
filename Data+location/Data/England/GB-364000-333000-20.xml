		<content> Sports facilities in the area are     
 limited to two soccer pitches, two    
 bowling greens, an outdoor swimming   
 pool and school facilities but the    
 area is well served by a Rugby Club,  
 Sports Centre and a Cricket,Hockey and
 Squash club in adjacent areas.The town
 soccer club is disbanded because a    
 ground cannot be found.This has been  
 the centre of argument for some time  
 in sporting circles and the local     
 press.At this moment local councils   
 favour land at Greenfields as sports  
 grounds.Other groups would prefer land
 at Farcroft to be developed.While the 
 debate continues the two local adult  
 teams play at Palethorpes Factory     
 Ground and at the Recreation Ground in
 Buntingsdale Road.
