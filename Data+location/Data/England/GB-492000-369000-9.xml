  {Buses:}residents thought that the   
 service is regular and very frequent. 
 It is served by Lincolnshire Road Car 
 and Lincoln City Transport.On weekdays
 there are 32 buses from St. Mark's bus
 station to Birchwood,with 12 on       
 Sundays.                              
  {By-pass:}this was welcomed for the  
 easier access it would bring.One      
 resident hoped it would reduce the    
 ammount of lorry traffic using        
 Birchwood as a short cut to Doddington
 road.Birchwood Avenue was hought busy 
 and dangerous.                        
  {Cars:}in the 7 Enumeration Districts
 where council housing was dominant,   
 42% of households owned 1 car and 3.5%
 owned 2.In the 4 E.D.'s where private 
 housing dominated 62% owned 1 car,26% 
 owned 2. (Information from census     
 1981).                                </content>
