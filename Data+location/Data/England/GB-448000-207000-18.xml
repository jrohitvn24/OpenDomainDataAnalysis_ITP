		<content>   Port Meadow is a low lying common   
land,down one side runs the River      
Thames.In winter the river floods and  
if it freezes people go skating on the 
ice .In the spring the flood water     
helps a lush crop of grass which the   
horses,cows and geese feed upon.       
   Sheep are not allowed to feed on the
meadow because they cut the grass too  
short so the cows can't get at it.Once 
a year the sheriff has a roundÂ£up of   
all the livestock on the meadow and if 
some are not claimed he sells them.The 
few geese that are kept there are very 
fierce;Wild Brent geese mix with       
Greylags and White Fronted tame ones.  
    Port Meadow has been a place of    
scientific interest since 1952.Apart   
from the livestock,there is an         
abundance of wildlife: herons,         
waterÂ£rats, foxes, Shelducks,          
    Garganies and Firecrests.          </content>
