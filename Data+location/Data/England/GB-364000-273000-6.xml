		<title>06The New Sports Hall</title>
		<content> The Sports Hall was finished in       
 February, 1985 and has been open since
 then. It was officially opened by the 
 former English cricket captain, Bob   
 Willis, on 25th of June. We waited in 
 the main hall at Lacon Childe for him.
 The chairman of the management        
 committee, Mr. Heath introduced Bob   
 Willis and everybody cheered and      
 clapped. In his talk he made an appeal
 to us to use the Sports Hall fully.   
 Then he pulled the string and the     
 curtain opened to show the plaque. He 
 later looked at the facilities with   
 us. There is tennis, badminton, bowls,
 football, netball, basketball, volley 
 ball, cricket, table tennis, weight   
 lifting, gymnastics and an exercise   
 bike. On the cricket pitch everybody  
 cheered when Bob bowled an over.      
 People then took photos, got his      
 autograph and shook hands with him.   </content>
