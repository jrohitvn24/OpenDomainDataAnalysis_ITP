     The cattle are kept out at grass  
 between the beginning of May and the  
 end of October and brought in for     
{milking twice a day}.On some farms    
 when they have recently calved they   
 are milked 3 times a day.They are     
 moved inside in the winter and fed on 
{silage,hay,straw,brewers grains and   
{the concentrates}which are fed at     
 milking times in the summer.The       
 concentrates are measured and fed acc-
 ording to the milk production of the  
 cow.The grass is cut for{silage}2,3,or
 even 4 times a year and is stored on  
 some farms in large black polythene   
 sacks,as well as in large mounds under
 polythene weighed down with tyres.    
{Straw}also used for bedding is usually
 brought from the south as little is   
 produced in Cheshire.
