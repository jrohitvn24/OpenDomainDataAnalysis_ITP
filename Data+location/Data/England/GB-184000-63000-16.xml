		<title>16AN AMERICAN IN TREGURRIAN</title>
		<content> I am Cliff Ancelet.When I first got   
 here I was overwhelmed by the traffic 
 driving on the left.To me it was the  
 wrong side.The first thing that       
 shocked me about my house was its     
 age,over 250 years old.I was used to  
 living in new houses.After 3 weeks I  
 only noticed the high cliffs,in       
 America I had not seen any.I made     
 friends with the only 2 kids in the   
 village ,in America I had at least 10 
 friends.I played in the open fields   
 and hedgerows which I had never seen  
 before.I usually played in woodland   
 areas in America.In Tregurrian we play
 in an old abandoned house across the  
 street.We visit a swamp across from my
 house to watch the newts,water        
 voles,magpies and pygamy shrews.I like
 it here although it is different from 
 Virginia.
