		<title>01SOUTH BEDFORD :1</title>
		<content> The part of Bedford south of the river
 is one of outstanding interest.       
 Bedford's origins are post-Roman and  
 the town plan was laid down in the    
 tenth century. Much of this plan still
 remains today in the town centre, both
 north and south of the River Great    
 Ouse. The town was fortified against  
 the Danish invaders and to the south  
 of the river, this involved the       
 construction of a bank and ditch,     
 King's Ditch.                         
                                       
 Outside this fairly small area, there 
 was little development until the 19th 
 century when large numbers of houses  
 were built along and off Ampthill     
 Road.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
