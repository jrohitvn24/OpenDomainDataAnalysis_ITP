		<title>04WHY I MOVED TO CHRISTCHURCH</title>
		<content> My family moved down here because of  
 my Dad's job.He works for Abbey Life. 
 We used to live in Surrey in Walton-  
 on-Thames.My Dad worked in London     
 before but now he works in            
 Bournemouth.He used to travel by      
 train.We have lived here for nine     
 years and are glad to be here;we would
 never go back.Bransgore is the name of
 the place I live now;it is quite a    
 large village although boring for     
 people around twelve years and over.I 
 go to Twynham Comprehensive School in 
 Christchurch.It is about four miles   
 from Bransgore.I travel by bus to get 
 there every day.Christchurch is a     
 better place to live because it has   
 more shops and play areas.It is near  
 the sea and the New Forest.Where I    
 used to live I was miles from the sea.
