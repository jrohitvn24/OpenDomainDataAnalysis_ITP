		<title>17Filleigh farms survey</title>
		<content> Most people keep hens.  Some keep     
 their eggs and some sell them locally.
 Some people keep ducks and geese as   
 well.  If people own lots of land they
 sometimes keep horses for riding.     
 The most popular tractors used on the 
 farms in Filleigh are Massey Ferguson,
 International and Ford.  Other types  
 used are John Deere, Fordson,         
 Universal, Lambourghini and Dexta.    
 On some farms computers are used.     
 Some are used for feeding the cows the
 cake during milking.  The cake comes  
 down a chute into a trough for each   
 cow at milking time.  The farmer types
 in the number which is branded on each
 cow, then the right amount of cake    
 comes down.  Some computers are used  
 for dairy management and monthly cash 
 flows.
