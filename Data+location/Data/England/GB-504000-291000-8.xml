		<content>Nearly  everybody   in  our   area  has
a  garden  near  or round  their house.
Some  people have  pieces of land  away
from  their  house  called  allotments.
Trees and bushes  you  can  find on the
side  of the road and some  people have
them in their gardens.                 
Flowers are special  in lots  of  ways.
They give  honey.   They  have  a  nice
smell, look nice and make people happy.
The best thing about  them is that  you
can get different types and all  shapes
and sizes.                             
Vegetables are one of the  many  things
that we grow in the garden.     We grow
vegetables to  eat.     They  are  also
good  for  you.   Some trees give nuts,
some give fruit,  and  some  give  much
enjoyment to children for  climbing and
and  to climb  and  for  people to  sit
under out of the sun.
