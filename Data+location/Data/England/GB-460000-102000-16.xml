		<content> These ships were dozens of Japanese   
 spies who inspecting all the other    
 ships. During the War, Portsmouth     
 Harbour was mainly occupied by        
 remnants of the French fleet, which   
 included the largest submarine at that
 time, which even had its own portable 
 aeroplane. In this War Britain lost   
 much of her Empire which resulted in  
 the decline in size of the Royal Navy.
 Many of the ships still remaining from
 the 1937 Fleet Review were sent to be 
 scrapped in Scapa Flow in Scotland.   
 At the next Fleet Review in 1953, to  
 mark the coronation of Queen Elizabeth
 II, there was only one battleship     
 compared to the twenty-five           
 battleships of 1937.  Mr King blamed  
 this reduction in size on the amount  
 of people the battleships had to      
 carry.
