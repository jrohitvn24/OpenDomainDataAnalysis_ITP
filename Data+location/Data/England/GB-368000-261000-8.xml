		<content> Nearly ninety per cent of the area is 
 farmland and the majority of the farms
 are now quite large.{Sir Francis      
{Winnington}of Shelsley Beachamp owns  
 much of the land to the east of the   
 B 4204 between Clifton-on-Teme and    
 Sapey Common.This land is farmed by   
{tennant farmers}and there is an       
 increasing tendency for traditional   
 farmhouses to be sold as private      
 dwellings leaving the land to be      
 farmed by one of the major tennant    
 farmers.The{Steps Farm}on the edge of 
 Clifton Village and the{Field House}at
 Upper Sapey are recent examples of    
 this.There are still farms which have 
 been run by well established families 
 for many years and names such as      
{Yeomans,Edwards}and{Carpenter}are     
 likely to be part of the local farming
 scene for many years.
