		<title>16Tickhill Corn Mill A</title>
		<content> This building recently worked but is  
 now boarded up and derelict.The{miller
 who used to work the mill came to talk
 to us.He told us how the mill was     
 worked by his Grandfather before him. 
 The mill was always used by the{      
{farmers}from villages around Tickhill 
 eg.Rossington,Wadworth,Harworth and   
 Stainton.Often the corn was left      
 outside the mill by the stone steps.  
 Eventually corn was only made into    
 meal this{fed the animals}in winter   
 and summer.Forty years ago the water  
 wheels were replaced by{electricity}as
 the water in the mill pond silted up  
 and could not give enough power.Up to 
 1983 the mill was used.Then the miller
{retired}the owner,Lord Scarbrough     
 decided to{sell}this property.Many    
 channels had to be looked into as     
 planning is special.
