		<content>   The lock is a favourite place for a 
 walk in the summer to watch all the   
 boats.                                
  The locks were built by the City of  
 London to by_pass the weir.The first  
 one was built in 1814 and then        
 re_built in 1908.In 1857 the lock was 
 given to the Thames Conservancy.The   
 river was used in years past by many  
 ships and barges carrying goods such  
 as coal and wood.Now it is used mainly
 by pleasure craft.About 40 000 boats a
 year go through the lock.             
  Around the hook,the big bend in the  
 river,there were many weirs to give   
 power to mills.None of these remain   
 now,except for place names.
