               As has been previously  
 indicated,there are approximately six 
 hundred residents of pensionable age  
 living within the{Parish}boundaries.  
 The local committee of{Age Concern}is 
 very active in looking after the      
 welfare of those who wish to take     
 advantage of its help.This committee  
 runs the{"Over Sixies Club"}which     
 meets socially once a week in the     
{Selwyn Hall}and currently has a       
 regular attendance of between 40 and  
 50 members who get together for a chat
 and enjoy tea provided by one of the  
 many organisations in the village.In  
 the summer months regular outings are 
 arranged and usually well supported.  
{Meals on wheels}are also available    
 twice a week for those who require    
 this service.                         
                                       </content>
