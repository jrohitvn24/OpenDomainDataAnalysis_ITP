		<content> Leisure in the 80's consists of       
{keeping fit and eating healthy food.  
 To keep their bodies in shape,people  
 are joining{sports clubs}while they   
 are still young and are taking up     
{jogging.}Keeping fit is the trend and 
 aerobic classes are popular.          
                                       
 In our area are a number of{football  
{clubs}and I belong to one called      
 Curley Park who I play for between    
 September and May.                    
 Girls can play{netball}or{hockey}for  
 the school,and in summer both sexes   
 can do{athletics.                     
                                       
 There are about four{youth clubs      
 around here and that is a common place
 for children from about 10-18 to

 two months and they are very popular  
 for children.                         </content>
