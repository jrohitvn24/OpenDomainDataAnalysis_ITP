		<title>19FIELD TRIPS, BURSTON AREA</title>
		<content>GROUP 1:                               
A most enjoyable exercise, once people 
discovered who we were and what our    
purpose was, they were very helpful and
showed great interest in the project.  
GROUP 2:                               
What impressed us about this area was  
how quiet and peaceful everywhere      
seemed. Although it was the time of the
school holidays, no noise was heard.   
GROUP 3:                               
We walked in the rain through muddy    
gateways, over fields, and talked to   
farmers.  It is lovely green country-  
side with mellow brick farmsteads.     
GROUP 4:                               
Our walk across fields and along narrow
lanes afforded views of the beautiful  
scenery.  The stillness was broken only
by grazing cattle and startled rabbits.
