		<content> Will be the first purpose built       
 sports centre in Hull when finished.  
 The centre is being built out of the  
 money raised by the City Council's{   
 lottery.They intend the facility to   
 cater for people of all ages and to   
 allow people to participate in a wide 
 range of activities.                  
 The large{multisports hall}:          
 badminton, gymnastics, football,      
 cricket, table tennis, trampoline,    
 body building, etc.                   
 The{indoor swimming pool}will be like 
 an island in the Pacific Ocean(palm   
 trees, artificial sand, waves).       
 This will be a fun pool for all the   
 family and not a racing pool like     
 Hull's others.                        
 There will also be facilities for     
 sunbeds, squash, bars and much more.  
 The sports centre will be a non profit
 making enterprise for the ratepayers. </content>
