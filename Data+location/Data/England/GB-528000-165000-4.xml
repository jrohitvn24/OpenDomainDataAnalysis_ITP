		<title>04MY DAY AT A SECONDARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content>     I am 12 years old and go to Wall- 
ington High School for Boys. At 8 a.m. 
I leave home,  and arrive at school    
half an hour later.  After our form    
master has marked the register we go   
to the Hall for Assembly - a hymn,     
reading from the Bible, and prayers.   
     English is our first lesson today 
and goes quickly.  Then we have French,
followed by Science and then a  break  
of 15 minutes to play outside. We cont-
inue Science experiments, have one more
lesson (Geography), and then it is time
for lunch - I am famished!             
     After lunch is Music (learning to 
play the recorder), then Maths, and    
lastly my favourite Classical Studies  
where we learn about the Greek gods.   
      School finishes at 3.45 unless   
there is a games practice for rugby or 
cricket.We usually have an hour's home-
work, and then my time is my own.      </content>
