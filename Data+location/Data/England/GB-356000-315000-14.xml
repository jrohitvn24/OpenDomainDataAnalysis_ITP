		<title>14CIVIL WAR HIGH ERCALL</title>
		<content> In 1645 the Civil War started. It was 
 King Charles and his Cavaliers against
 Oliver Cromwell with his Roundheads.  
 Oliver Cromwell had a siege on High   
 Ercall Hall for 2 weeks but the       
 Royalists forced them out. The Hall   
 became a fortress for King Charles. On
 July 4th 1645 there was a second siege
 with 1100 men. 100 men were killed and
 350 Roundheads captured. There were   
 only 3 Garrisons of King Charles in   
 Salop. They were High Ercall,         
 Bridgnorth  and Ludlow. High Ercall   
 fell first, then Bridgnorth and then  
 Ludlow. But there were still Cavaliers
 in the Hall so the Roundheads went    
 back to the Hall with a battery of    
 cannons and battered the Hall for 9   
 hours. Then the Hall surrendered. Sir 
 Richard was find Â£16,687 13 shillings 
 and 3d. By Richard Thompkinson and    
 Nicholas Willoughby                   </content>
