		<title>03TRANSPORT AT PURTON STOKE</title>
		<content>                                       
 A woman who lived in the Post office  
 at Purton Stoke said that the         
 Cheltenham bus company runs the bus   
 route but it says on the timetable    
 that Thamesdown Transport Service     
 does the route.                       
 The bus comes at {9.22am}and leaves   
 the village at {9.24am }and gets back 
 to Wootton Bassett at{9.56am}.The bus 
 leaves Wootton Bassett at{11.30am}and 
 gets back at {12.02pm }.The bus comes 
 once a week, that's on a Friday.      
 The woman said they are very lucky to 
 have a bus once a week because some   
 villages have no buses                
 Near the bus stop there is a derelict 
 garage .                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
