		<title>16Changes within a lifetime</title>
		<content> The adults{interviewed}listed a       
 variety of changes that had happened  
 in Clovelly in their lifetime.  At    
 school "you had to sit at your desk   
 all day";"there used to be a wall     
 between the boys and girls playground"
 and someone said "I had to walk 2     
 miles to school every day 40 years    
 ago".  Many commented on the amount of
 fresh people who have come here to    
 live but that the place itself had not
 changed.  More people have cars; more 
 have bathrooms in their houses and it 
 was said that more people can swim    
 nowadays.  Fewer people go to church  
 today.  Someone thought there were    
 fewer flowers and varieties of flowers
 today.  There also used to be a big   
 passenger steamer call here regularly 
 and more dances in the old days.      
                                       
                                       </content>
