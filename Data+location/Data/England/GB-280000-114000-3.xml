		<content> Most people of working age in         
 Witheridge have been able to find     
 employment.Mole Valley Farmers employ 
 eighteen people , a small soft toys   
 factory employ six , the local garage 
 employ twelve and various other small 
 business employ up to six people each.
 A number of people travel to work     
 mainly to Tiverton , South Molton , or
 Crediton and Exeter.These people have 
 a variety of jobs ranging from        
 secretarial to engineering.There are  
 very few professional people in the   
 village - the doctor , four vets and a
 few teachers.                         
     The village badly need more light 
 industry in order to attract young    
 people to the area.This age group     
 cannot afford to travel too far to    
 work and tend to live nearer their    
 work.
