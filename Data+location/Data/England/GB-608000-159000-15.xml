		<title>15Transport Depot, Dargate.</title>
		<content> An international transport depot is   
 situated at Dargate Farm, Dargate.    
 Articulated container lorries depart  
 from here each week to many           
 destinations in Europe.  The vehicles 
 only return to their depot perhaps    
 once in a week, which does reduce the 
 inconvenience to local inhabitants.   
 Dargate residents are only aware that 
 the depot is there when they meet one 
 of the lorries round the narrow lanes 
 or hear the refrigerating compressors 
 on the containers of food working     
 during the night.                     
 The Company employs three             
 administrative staff, one fitter and  
 apprentice plus several drivers.  Only
 three of the staff live in the        
 village.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
