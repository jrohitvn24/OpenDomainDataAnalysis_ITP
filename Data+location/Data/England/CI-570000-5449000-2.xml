		<title>02MONT ORGUEIL CASTLE (1)</title>
		<content>    On a soggy Wednesday 26th June 1985
 2nd year set one (Humanities) of      
 Grainville School braved the elements 
 and set off to Mont Orgueil Castle    
 (Mount Pride), or Gorey Castle as it  
 is often called. We arrived, after    
 fifteen minutes of travelling, at the 
 early 13th century castle. It is built
 on a natural mound and overlooks{Gorey
{harbour}to the west and{St.Catherine's
{Bay}to the north, with sea stretching 
 out to the south and east to the coast
 of France.                            
                                       
    The castle was originally built for
 defence against the French, but as one
 of the wax-works scenes depicts it was
 later replaced by{Elizabeth Castle, } 
 because with the invention of cannon  
 it could easily be captured if the    
 enemy managed to reach the hill       
 overlooking the castle to the west.   </content>
