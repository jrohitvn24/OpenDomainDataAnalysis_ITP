		<title>16PAGHAM PARISH COUNCIL</title>
		<content> We wrote to the Clerk and Executive   
 Officer of Pagham Parish Council.  He 
 told us that just recently the        
 Government has carried out a{boundary 
{review}which has meant that a part of 
 the parish has been transferred to    
 Aldwick Parish Council.   This is the 
 second time that this has happened.   
                                       
 The Parish Council{owns and maintains}
 bus shelters, public seats, lighting, 
 litter bins, notice boards, a car     
 park, a play area at Hook Lane/Sefter 
 Road and play equipment for part of   
 the foreshore with seats and walkway. 
                                       
 The council has two{employees;}the    
 clerk, who is part time, and a casual 
 labourer employed to clean the bus    
 shelters and, during the summer, the  
 foreshore and play area.
