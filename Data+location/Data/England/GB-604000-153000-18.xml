		<title>18A DAY IN THE LIFE OF.</title>
		<content>   In the morning when I wake up I have
 my breakfast and then I get dressed.  
 Then I wash and brush my teeth and set
 off for school.We travel to school by 
 car. At 9-00 a.m. a teacher blows a   
 whistle and we all lead into class. We
 get our hymn books and we go straight 
 to assembly.We spend most of the day  
 working but we have playtime at 10-40 
 a.m. for 20 minutes and we stop for   
 lunch at 12-00. I bring sandwiches to 
 eat.We finish school at 3-15 p.m. and 
 we go home in the car. When I get home
 I usually play with the cat and have  
 an ice pop. At 6-30 p.m. my Dad comes 
 home and we all have tea together.    
 After tea I watch the television or   
 have a bath. I go to bed at 8-30 and  
 read for a while  before going to     
 sleep.
