		<title>13Social Concerns - Yardley</title>
		<content>Our area is mainly housing,Therefore   
matters of concern revolve around      
questions of amenities and general care
of the area.The condition of the       
pavements is something many people     
were anxious about.The general feeling 
is that people parking their cars on   
the pavements make the situation       
worse.Litter also troubles             
residents.There is a feeling everyone  
should take responsibility for         
remedying this.People feel there is a  
need in the immediate area to provide  
more amenities for leisure, especially 
for young children and teenagers.      
People are afraid the problems of      
vandalism and petty crime will worsen  
if facilities are not improved.        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
