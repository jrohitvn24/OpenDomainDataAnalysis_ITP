		<content>{Farmers around the gravel and landfill
 sites are affected by rubbish carried 
 by the wind eg.dormant seeds,and      
 bones/litter caused by scavenging     
 birds,especially crows.The litter is  
 picked up by livestock causing        
 sickness,even death.Mr.Webb has also  
 been troubled by thistle and poppy    
 seeds,but the company are helping in  
 their control.Mr.Smith,however,has a  
 more serious problem in the           
 fluctuating level of his well.When    
 Ryton Gravel Pits Lake was established
 as a permanent site,it was first lined
 with clay to keep the water level     
 static.However,during the dry period  
 summer 1983 to winter 1985,the water  
 level continued to fall for no other  
 known reason,hence the present        
 monitoring.Gravel workings present a  
 safety hazard as they tempt people to 
 swim.Some fatalities have occurred.   </content>
