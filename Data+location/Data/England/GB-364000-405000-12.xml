 In Westhoughton many houses are       
 still{heated by coal}as a lot of      
 people still prefer an open fire.The  
 coal is{delivered}to the houses by the
 coalman,who has a very dirty and      
 tiring job.He needs to be dressed in{ 
{strong clothes and boots},and he wears
 a sleeveless leather overall across   
 his back,to protect it from the sharp 
 edges of the coal.The coal is         
 delivered to the houses in{sacks},    
 which are emptied into{coal bunkers or
{coal sheds}.The householder carries   
 the coal into the house on a{shovel}. 
    The coalman we interviewed has been
 working at the job for 7 years,and    
 delivers coal to {300 houses}a day.
