 is one of{mixed farming and managed   
{woodland.}The woods are mainly oak and
 chestnut{copses.}The{grassland        
 supports Friesian cattle and some     
 sheep and horses. Some fields were    
 used for hay and silage in 1985; the  
 rest were sown with{cereals}like oats,
 barley and maize. One field had sugar 
 beet. Much of the land is privately   
 owned by Glover's Farm and Worsham    
 Farm.                                 
    The{only large industrial works}in 
 our block is the{brickworks}at Turkey 
 Road. Originally started as the       
 Lunsford Works about 1914, it is now  
 part of{Redland Bricks Ltd.}It makes 4
 types of brick from local clays and   
 employs around 80 people.
