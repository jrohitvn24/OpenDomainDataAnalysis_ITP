  The land in this block is            
 predominantly flat and agricultural   
 with a small area of coniferous       
 woodland owned by the Forestry        
 Commission, and approximately 400     
 acres of sand quarries.               
  The former Great North Road, now the 
 A638, runs North to South and at one  
 time caused heavy congestion in the   
 centre of Bawtry.  The traffic now    
 uses the A1M which lies to the West.  
 The main East-coast railway line also 
 runs through the block.               
  There are two centres of habitation, 
 Bawtry and Austerfield.  Bawtry is a  
 small thriving dormitory town lying 8 
 miles South of Doncaster.  Austerfield
 is a village of under 500 inhabitants 
 situated a mile North East of Bawtry  
 on the A614.  Aircraft from RAF       
 Finningly frequently overfly the area.</content>
