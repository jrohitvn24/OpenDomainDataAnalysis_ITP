 to the church and was built in 1853.In
 1967 it became an area school taking  
 children from a number of villages    
 including Pilton, West Bradley, North 
 Wootton and East Pennard. At that time
 it was enlarged with a new hall,      
 kitchen and mobile classrooms. Today  
 the school has 183 children aged 4 to 
 11. Some come over 5km to school each 
 day and are transported by a local    
 coach and mini-bus firm.              
    The school feeds four secondary    
 schools in Shepton Mallet,Glastonbury,
 Wells and Ansford with new pupils. The
 staff comprises six teachers, the head

 facilities include a covered swimming 
 pool, playing field, adventure        
 playground and a range of computers
