		<title>04BISHOPSBOURNE VILLAGE (2)</title>
		<content> Unlike many villages where the addit- 
 ion of modern housing has increased   
 the population, Bishopsbourne, with no
 new development, has seen its populat-
 ion decline steadily, reaching an est-
 imated low for the village of 80 in   
 1975 since when it has risen slightly.
 Many of the residents are middle-aged 
 or retired and this is partly due to  
 the lack of suitable housing for young
 families. In the village there is no  
 through traffic, street lighting, car-
 parking areas, pavements, schools,    
 doctors and hardly any employment. The
 Mermaid Inn is very popular, serving  
 excellent bar meals. It attracts many 
 visitors which adds to the parking    
 problems. In 1984 the local forge     
 re-opened; thus reviving a link with  
 "Ye forge at Burnes"(Domesday Book).  
 The Smith specializes in high class   
 architectural iron work.              </content>
