		<content> Most of the owner occupied houses are 
 on mains water linked to the Thirlmere
 - Manchester pipeline but nearly all  
 the Estate farms use their own spring 
 water. Everyone has electricity but   
 there is no gas. Most cooking is done 
 by electricity though there are some  
 'Aga style' cookers which may run on  
 oil. There are just a few microwave   
 ovens but most people have freezers.  
 All families have washing machines    
 and some have dishwashers. Most people
 have access to a car for shopping and 
 much is done in Lancaster or at the   
 Post Office in Dolphinholme, where    
 pensions are collected with the help  
 neighbours. Two travelling shops visit
 twice weekly - a baker and a butcher  
 who carries a variety of other goods. 
 The library van visits the area and   
 there is a police station here but no 
 doctor's surgery nearer than Galgate. </content>
