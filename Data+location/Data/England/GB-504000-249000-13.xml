		<content>   This is how you play{Three Bad Eggs.
 Player 1 has a ball. Players 2,3,4    
 etc. pick a subject and choose a type 
 of the subject. For instance          
 'motorbikes':Suzuki,Honda,Yamaha etc. 
   They tell Player 1 what types they  
 have chosen, but not who chose them.  
 Player 1 then picks one of the types  
 and throws the ball in the air.  the  
 player whose type it is runs to catch 
 the ball and shouts stop. Meanwhile   
 Player 1 runs forward with the rest.  
 When they have stopped the player who 
 has caught the ball takes three steps 
 forward and throws the ball at a      
 person's legs. If it misses he has got
 a {bad egg},if it hits then the person
 hit is "it" plus a{bad egg}. If you   
 have three{bad eggs}then you go       
 through the{torture machine}three     
 times, which involves tickling. Then  
 you start again.                      </content>
