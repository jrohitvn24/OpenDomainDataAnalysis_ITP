		<title>01GENERAL INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content> The dominant feature in the area is   
 the Englefield Estate, which has at   
 ita centre a house and a deer park.   
 The Estate built and owns Englefield  
 village and owns almost all of the    
 farmland. The area contains the rivers
 Pang and Bourne and their vallies,    
 hence giving the area its undulating  
 characteristic. The village of        
 Bradfield is dominated by its         
 independent boys boarding school.     
 There is a comprehensive and two      
 primary schools in the area. The      
 workhouse at Bradfield is now used as 
 a mental hospital largely catering for
 mentally handicapped adults. The main 
 north-south road, the A340, carries   
 traffic between Pangbourne and Theale.
 It crosses the M4 which runs east-west
 through the area but has no access    
 points. In the north of the area there
 is a Nature Conservancy area.         </content>
