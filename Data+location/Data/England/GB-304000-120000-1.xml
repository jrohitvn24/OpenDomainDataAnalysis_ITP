       Our area is on the edge         
 of Somerset and is little known. We   
 have very little through traffic; the 
 lanes are all very narrow and         
 twisting, with high hedges. It is     
 hilly country, the hills becoming     
 steeper as you travel north.          
       The buildings are mainly farm   
 houses and cottages. There are very   
 few modern buildings in the area.     
 'New' houses tend to be old buildings 
 which have been converted.            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
