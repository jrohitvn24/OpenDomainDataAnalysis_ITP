		<content> CHICHESTER METRO STATION              
{Chichester Station}is right next to   
 our school.Buses stop right outside   
 the station so that people transfer   
 from buses from the town suburbs to   
 the {Metro}system.                    
{The Metro Station}was recently built  
 from 1981 to 1983.When they were      
 building the metro a lot of our       
 playground was destroyed and was made 
 shorter.Workmen were always coming    
 into our yard and this went on for    
 months on end.                        
{Chichester}is typical of most metro   
 stations on{Tyneside}.There is easy   
 access, a newsagent's shop, ticket    
 machines and maps of the system.The   
 stations are unmanned and everything  
 is automatic.Once on the system you   
 can transfer from train to bus or     
 ferry.It is called an{Integrated      
{System.}A child pays only 5p fare.    </content>
