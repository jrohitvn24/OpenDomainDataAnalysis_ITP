		<content>   South Axholme is our comprehensive  
 school and it is attended by 900      
 pupils. It has a three storey main    
 building,a separate south block,      
 and many other out buildings. There   
 are many different mixed ability      
 classes in the first year, named after
 important local people such as Wesley,
 Franklin, Herewood, Newton and        
 Tennyson. After the first year        
 children are put into sets of similar 
 ability for their working groups.     
 Children come to South Axholme from   
 all the villages in the southern part 
 of the Isle of Axholme. They spend    
 five years at South Axholme after when
 they usually go on to John Leggot     
 sixth form college or North Lindsey   
 Technical College in Scunthorpe if    
 they want to continue their Education.
