		<title>01A Brief Outline of the Area</title>
		<content>{The area we have been allocated lies  
{approximately two miles to the north  
{of Hastings.The land rises to a high  
{ridge and therefore the main east to  
{west road across our 12 kilometre     
{grid is called The Ridge.}There are   
 large areas of mainly deciduous       
 woodland notably Maplehurst Wood,Park 
 Wood ,Coghurst Wood and St. Helen's   
 Wood. The areas of woodland are       
 punctuated with areas of permanent    
 pasture and grass land.{South of The  
{Ridge there is a great deal of housing
{both private and council owned.In the 
{extreme South West corner of our      
{alloted area lies the picturesque     
{Bucks Hole reservour .Shopping        
{facilities are at Silverhill which is 
{at the south west end of this area and
{at Ore which is at the south eastern  
{corner.
