		<content>  The{N.E.of England}has a reputation  
 for heavy drinking among the men. One 
 short street in the area has four{    
{public houses}within a distance of a  
 few hundred metres. They are old      
 buildings and are left over from the  
 days when there was lots of{heavy     
{industry}in the area and the workmen  
 needed to clear their throats of dust 
 and grime.                            
  One of the oldest{working men's      
{social clubs}in the area faced closure
 early this year until it was rescued  
 by{Gateshead Football Club}joining it 
 in a partnership. The cost of building
 new premises a few years ago had left 
 it with debts of Â£20000 which it could
 not afford to repay. Is this a sign of
 changing times and habits?
