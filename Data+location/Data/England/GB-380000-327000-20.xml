		<title>20Farming around Eccleshall</title>
		<content> The river Sow valley irrigates and    
 drains a large acreage of rich meadow-
 land, making this a principal Midland 
 dairy-farming area. A neighbouring    
 milk collection depot, originally     
 founded by Cadbury's, is now used by  
 the Milk Marketing Board. Large       
 numbers of store cattle graze some of 
 the land, with smaller numbers of     
 sheep, pigs and poultry, including a  
 few rare breeds of sheep. Wheat and   
 barley are main crops, with oilseed   
 rape an alternative which makes use of
 the same machinery for harvesting.    
 Eccleshall is a centre for subsidiary 
 farming trades: machinery sales and   
 repairs, a transport company, black-  
 smith, sales of seeds and animal      
 foodstuffs, medicines and chemical    
 requirements, and a thriving          
 veterinary surgery.
