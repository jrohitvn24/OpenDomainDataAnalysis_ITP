		<title>11THE PARISH COUNCIL</title>
		<content> In the parish of Tedburn there are 10 
 parish Councillors, elected every 4   
 years. Meetings are held once a month 
 and are open to the public who are    
 invited to bring their problems and   
 comments. Councillors work closely    
 with the community dealing with a     
 variety of local problems; providing  
 street lighting, lights that don't    
 work, highway maintenance, refuse,    
 environmental, etc. An important part 
 of its work is consultation with the  
 District Council on planning matters. 
 It endeavours to put its case on      
 behalf of the local community before a
 decision is made. The parish council  
 is involved in road safety            
 committees, Parish Emergency Work,    
 etc. Parish councillors have a pride  
 in their local community and concern  
 for its future. The only paid member  
 is the Clerk.                         </content>
