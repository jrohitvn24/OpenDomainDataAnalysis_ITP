 7.30am.I prepare breakfast,my         
 husband and two daughters wash and    
 dress.After breakfast and seeing my   
 husband go to his occupation as an    
 engineer,and my daughters to thier    
 respective senior and junior schools,I
 complete the daily chores. Afterwards 
 I go for a walk to a point of local   
 interest, visiting a friend for coffee
 on the return journey. Home for       
 mid_day to prepare lunch I accompany  
 my youngest daughter to school to     
 perform voluntary, general auxilary   
 duties. Return home at 3.45pm.to

 my husband to Drama classes.The day   
 ends with family  conversation, or    
 occasionally, television viewing.
