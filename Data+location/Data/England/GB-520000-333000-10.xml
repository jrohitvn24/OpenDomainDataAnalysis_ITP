		<content>     The school (Quadring Primary) is  
 on the boundary of Donington and      
 Quadring. It was built in 1725 or     
 1726. It educates 46 children at the  
 moment. There are two teachers. One is
 Mrs. Featherstone who teaches the     
 infant class and the other is Mr.     
 Dainty ,the headteacher and teacher of
 the junior class. The school starts at
 9.00 a.m. and finishes at 3.15 p.m.   
     On Tuesday afternoons we go       
 swimming in Spalding. After swimming  
 mums listen to us read and do sewing. 
 Wednesdays itis recorder, Thursday    
 mums hear us read again and on Friday 
 it is violin. The school runs very    
 happily and busily. With netball,     
 football and chess teams it is rather 
 hectic.
