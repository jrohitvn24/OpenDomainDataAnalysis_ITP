		<content> My dad is a bricklayer. He builds     
 houses and sometimes factories and    
 flats.A bricklayer's nickname is  a   
 "bricky" and my dad has been a        
 "bricky" all of his working life.The  
 tools that he needs for his job are a 
 spirit level,which tells him whether  
 his bricks have been laid level or    
 not;a trowel,which he uses to put the 
 cement on the bricks,a pointing trowel
 to smooth the bed of mortar between   
 each layer of bricks, and a lump      
 hammer which he uses to knock a wall  
 down or to make a hole in a wall.     
 Mortar is used to hold the bricks     
 together and is made from mixing      
 sand,cement and water together. This  
 can be done either by hand using a    
 shovel or in a machine called a cement
 mixer. Bricklaying is a very skilled  
 job and you have to train for a long  
 time before you are good at it.       </content>
