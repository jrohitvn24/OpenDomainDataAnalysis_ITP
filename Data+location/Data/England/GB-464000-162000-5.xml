		<content> Traditional birthday teas with party  
 games are still enjoyed by many       
 children. However, outings to local   
 pleasure areas are becoming more      
 common. "Inflatables" proliferate this
 year. In the home many parties rely on
 a hired entertainer or video film.    
 Barbecued food is popular for summer  
 birthdays. Cakes in the shape of      
 numbers are quite common but many     
 children request cakes based on       
 favourite television programmes:-     
 Thomas the Tank Engine, Super Ted,    
 Postman Pat or the Wombles. For       
 presents, BMX bikes, electronic games,
 cassettes with accompanying texts are 
 popular. Another new trend is a robo- 
 machine which changes from its        
 original shape of car or aeroplane    
 into something different - robot or   
 dinosaur, simply by pulling and       
 twisting various parts in sequence.   </content>
