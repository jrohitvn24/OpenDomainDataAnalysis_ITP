 many people say;"Oh marry a           
 farmer,they are very rich!".But       
 they don't realise that it is hard    
 work.                                 
   Here is a timetable of his average  
 days work:{                           
{8a.m.}He gets up and has his breakfast
{8.40am.}He goes around and feeds all  
 the animals in turn,around the farm   
 buildings.                            
{9.40am.}He then feeds the animals out 
 in the fields.                        </content>
