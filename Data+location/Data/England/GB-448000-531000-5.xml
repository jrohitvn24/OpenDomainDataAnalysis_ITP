		<content>{10.  What was she doing before she    
{came to Hartlepool?}  In 1927 she was 
 fitted as a pontoon atached to an oil 
 fuel depot and in 1929 she was moved  
 to Pembroke Dock to serve that purpose
 until 1979.                           
{11.  How long has it been in          
{Hartlepool?}  The Warrior has been in 
 Hartlepool 5 years, she came in       
 September 1979 and she has been in the
 Coal Dock ever since.                 
{12. Why is it here?} The Warrior is   
 here to undergo repairs and at the end
 of June 1985 there was a small fire on
 board which will delay repairs.       
{13.  Where is the H.M.S. Warrior?} The
 H.M.S. Warrior is in old Hartlepool at
 the Coal Dock which was used for      
 bringing in coal.
