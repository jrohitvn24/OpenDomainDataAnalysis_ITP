		<title>12BOUGHTON PUBS</title>
		<content> Boughton Monchelsea has two pubs, the 
 'Albion' and the 'Cock Inn'.          
 The 'Albion', situated in the middle  
 of the village, was built about 1800  
 on the site of an older               
 coaching-house, its first recorded    
 owner being a farmer in 1812. For many
 years it was used as a posting-house. 
 The present landlords, not long in    
 residence, are keen to keep the local 
 trade, but are also busy trying to    
 build up the food side of the         
 business. The pub is plain but        
 traditional in style and popular with 
 the locals.                           
 The 'Cock Inn', an attractive         
 weatherboarded building dating from   
 about 1400, stands on the long        
 straight Heath Road between Coxheath  
 and Langley. It is used mainly by     
 passers-by, and so is not really in   
 competition with the nearby 'Albion'. </content>
