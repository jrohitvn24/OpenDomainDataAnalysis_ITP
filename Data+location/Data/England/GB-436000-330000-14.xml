		<content> Close by the Municipal Sports ground  
 are the Regional Swimming Pool and    
 Moor Lane Sports Centre.              
   The Sports Centre is used for       
 squash, badminton, table-tennis,      
 weight lifting, trampolining, judo,   
 indoor athletics and even old time    
 dancing. It is used by people of five 
 years old and upwards. More men than  
 women use it. The weight lifting is   
 used most often by the Afro-Carribean 
 nationals as a body-building exercise 
 and the Asians are especially keen on 
 power lifting.                        
   The Regional Swimming Pool is used  
 by the general public and also by     
 local swimming clubs for their weekly 
 training sessions and for holding     
 Galas. There are two pools, a teaching
 pool and the main pool. There is a    
 diving board in the main pool.
