		<content>Allimore Green Common is a conservation
area  where plants and insects are kept
safe from harm.It is a 61/2 acre field 
which belongs to the Staffordshire     
Conservation Trust lying just outside  
Haughton and is looked after by Mrs    
Leigh, who lives in Eccleshall.The area
is unploughed,undrained grazing land   
which is rich in plants and insects and
has many rare species.At the back of   
the field is a little pool which stays 
wet when the weather is hot and so the 
plants survive.One of the plants we    
especially wanted to see was the       
Spotted Orchid which has pink petals   
with purple spots.Marsh Marigolds,Spear
Thistles,Milkworts,Ragged              
Robins.Birdsfoot Trefoil.Fairy         
Flax,Marsh Valerian,Southern Marsh     
Orchid,Black Medick are also to be     
found.
