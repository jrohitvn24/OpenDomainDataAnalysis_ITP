		<content>  Godsfield Chapel                     
 The chapel was built in the 12th or   
 13th century by the Knights           
 Hospitallers and consists of the      
 priests two storey house with a       
 squint to the altar and the remains of
 a chimney, attached to the chapel.    
 All is in a fair state of             
 preservation, privately owned and     
 surrounded by gardens now, but would  
 have been beside the ancient main road
 from Winchester, Englands capital, to 
 Farnham and London with plenty of     
 pilgrims passing and destitute persons
 to whom the Knights offered food.     
 There is a local legend that there was
 a tunnel between Godsfield and        
 Abbotstone village and treasure was   
 found at the Godsfield end and was    
 given to a London museum.  One man    
 remembers seeing the Abbotstone end of
 the tunnel when a boy!                </content>
