		<title>08A Day In My Life</title>
		<content>   Every  Sunday my brother comes and  
 wakes me up when I'm asleep. Sometimes
 I read a book. When Craig comes in I  
 pretend I am asleep and I look out of 
 the corner of my eye to see what he is
 doing. Then I wake pretending I have  
 been asleep. He tells me to read Pussy
 in the Well which is his favourite    
 rhyme. I recite it over and over      
 again. When mum gets up Craig rushes  
 to his bedroom and pretends he was    
 asleep. When mum knocks on the doors  
 we wake up. After that we have a      
 shower get dried and dressed then we  
 go down and have breakfast.I then go  
 upstairs with a duster in my hand to  
 dust my room. After that I play or go 
 to the market. Then my brother asks if
 he can play with me. I say yes so we  
 play Guess Who. Then we play I Spy.   
 After that we play with lego. After   
 dinner I play my guitar and watch T.V.</content>
