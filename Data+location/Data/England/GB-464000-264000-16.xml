		<content>   Four years ago, a group of children 
asked the Quarry Management Committee  
for a play area in the wood by the     
Quarry, but it was not possible        
because it would be necessary to put up
a fence, so that no one could fall in  
the Quarry, to satisfy the Insurance   
Company.                               
   The Parish Council leased an area   
of land beside West Road from the      
National Trust, for the Play Area      
Committee. The Committee Members have  
been cutting down the trees (coppice)  
to make a track for B.M.X. bikes. They 
are now waiting for a tractor to come  
along and winch the tree stumps out.   
Part of the area will be used for a    
climbing frame and slide for the       
younger children.                      
   Our Headmaster is the Chairman of   
the Committee. Money has come from the 
Parish Council and from Fete Funds.    </content>
