 In Gainford there is a variety of     
 styles of housing. Around the{village 
{green}the housing is terraced. Along  
 High Row, rich{Georgian merchants     
 built their houses and settled down in
 Gainford coming from Darlington. There
 is some{Victorian}housing scattered   
 around the village, near the old      
 railway line. South View was built in 
 the 19th century as boarding houses.  
 Eden Crest, Station Court and Orchard 
 Grove are all{council housing.}Balmer 
 Hill, Station Court and Academy       
 Gardens are more recent modern        
 developments, built during the last   
 twenty years. In Gainford today there 
 are no new developments being built,  
 except for Snow Hall and an old       
 farmhouse being renovated and         
 re-furbished and being sold as new    
 houses.                               </content>
