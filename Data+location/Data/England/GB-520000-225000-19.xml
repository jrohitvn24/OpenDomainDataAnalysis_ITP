		<title>19STEVENAGE- LOCAL POLICEMAN</title>
		<content> Our Neighbourhood policeman is P.C    
 Locke. He lives in a house near to    
 Woolenwick Schools where his children 
 went until they were 11 years old. He 
 visits our school every term to talk  
 to the fourth year classes.           
   He tells them all about his job in  
 the area. He usually goes everywhere  
 on his bike and he has a personal     
 radio so that he can contact his      
 control and they can keep in touch    
 with him. He has to use a code of     
 special numbers to let the station    
 know where he is and what he is doing 
 and to get help if he needs it.       
   Sometimes he talks about crime or   
 shows films. He usually helps the     
 children to do a play about the police
 at work and he takes the class around 
 the local police station and shows    
 them the cells and all the offices and
 other rooms and how to use the Telex. </content>
