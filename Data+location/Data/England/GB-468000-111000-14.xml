 made a limited company in 1933. Mr.E. 
 Edney established the business with   
 A.T.Smeads. Turf is grown around the  
 New Forest, West Sussex and Surrey.   
 They have supplied places such as {   
{Wembley Stadium, Windsor Castle and   
{Wimbledon.}They also export to        
 Germany, Jersey and France. The turf  
 costs about 60p per square yard and   
 comes from established pastures. After
 the land has been cultivated it is    
 resown and used again. Butser Turf let
 their farmland to farmers who allow   
 their sheep to graze. The company     
 advertises in the local press and     
 Yellow Pages as far as Cornwall but   
 their lorries are their best          
 advertisement. When the company       
 celebrated their 50th anniversary in  
 1983, they calculated they had sold {
