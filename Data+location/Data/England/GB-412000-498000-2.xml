		<title>02HUDSWELL VILLAGE</title>
		<content> The village itself has developed over 
 the years along both sides of the main
 street, and apart from the Pub,       
 School, and Village Hall, the         
 buildings are mostly cottages in      
 differing styles of construction and  
 architecture.  The Post Office is a   
 converted dwelling.  There are only a 
 small number of modern houses.  Farms 
 line the main street at both ends of  
 the village.  The Church of St.       
 Michael and All Angels, is at the West
 End of the village where the road runs
 into the surrounding moorland.        
 A small play area in the village      
 contains some swings.  The School is  
 for children up to Secondary School   
 age.  Entertainment is home-made, a   
 Folk Group meet at the Pub weekly.    
 Sheep farming is the local industry.
