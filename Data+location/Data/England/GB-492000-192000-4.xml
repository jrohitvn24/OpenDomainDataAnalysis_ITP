		<title>04The Gipsy Site.</title>
		<content>  There is a{Gypsy site}along the      
 Amersham Road.At present there are    
 four cars under repair on the site    
 as well as nine caravans.The mud      
 covered site is untidy and besieged by
 stinging nettles and thistles.        
  The Gypsies previously lived on a    
 site in Gerrards Cross but were       
 ordered to leave and moved to their   
 present site.This was for a period of 
 six weeks only,they have,however,been 
 at the present site for a year.       
  At Gerrards Cross they paid Â£10 a    
 week for the site which had           
 toilets,showers and hot and cold      
 running water.At the latter site they 
 pay Â£8 per week for cold water only.  
 For showers and baths they travel into
 Slough,the nearest town.              
  The situation seems desperate as     
 living conditions are squalid.They    
 would like to return to the old site. </content>
