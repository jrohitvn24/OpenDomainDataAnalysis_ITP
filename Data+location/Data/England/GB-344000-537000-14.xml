		<title>14BRACKENBURGH HOME FARM</title>
		<content> Reference should be made to our       
 photograph of this farm.  The         
 structure is an interesting example of
 the way in which farming has developed
 in this area over the last few        
 generations. Originally, the farmstead
 was constructed to cater primarily for
 dairy production, which was conducted 
 on a fairly extensive scale, as the   
 buildings indicate.  Today, they all  
 stand empty of cattle of any kind,    
 despite their excellent design, as it 
 is preferable for this farm to have   
 gone over exclusively to grain and    
 cereal crop production.  The buildings
 are used today for storage and sacking
 of grain, and to house machinery and  
 equipment.
