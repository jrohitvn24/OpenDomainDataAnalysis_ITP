		<title>12HORTICULTURAL SHOW</title>
		<content> First held  1884. Popular annual event
 ( 3rd Saturday in August) supported by
 local  gardeners  &amp;  craftsmen.    Has
 horticultural,  floral - art,  crafts,
 domestic  &amp;  children's  sections.  On
 17th August 1985,  after weeks of poor
 weather ,   bright  day  brought  many
 visitors  to the Endowed School to see
 the show  and  watch the sports.  This
 year  it  was  too costly  to have the
 usual band  &amp; fancy-dress parade.  860
 exhibits ( 143  from  children )  were
 displayed  by  121  exhibitors .  High
 standard   was   reached   throughout.
 Trophies, diplomas, seedsmen's awards,
 special  &amp; money prizes were presented
 by the President during the afternoon.
 Expenses  are high and there is always
 a  loss on the Show,  reduced somewhat
 by  profits on  a  plant stall &amp; teas.
 Smaller shows  are  held twice yearly,
 mainly for the Society's 100 members. </content>
