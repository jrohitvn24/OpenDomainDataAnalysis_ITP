		<title>04Christ Church,Redhill</title>
		<content> Built in 1844,Christ Church still     
 plays an important part in Redhill    
 life.It is part of Wrington parish but
 has its own priest-in-charge with a   
 parsonage in the village.             
   This year(1985) the old school bell 
 was dedicated at the harvest          
 thanksgiving and set up in the church 
 porch.The bell had been used for 110  
 years at Redhill school,which closed  
 in 1984.                              
   There is a plaque in the church     
 porch which states that 250 of the 315
 seats are declared to be "free and    
 unappropriated for ever".This was     
 because two ecclesiastical societies  
 made grants of Â£80 and Â£90 towards the
 church building in 1844.
