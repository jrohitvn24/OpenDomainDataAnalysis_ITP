		<content>   The Exmoor National Park is a       
 beautiful place and C M, which lies on
 the western edge, attracts visitors   
 from all parts of Britain and overseas
   There is plenty of holiday          
 accomodation including six hotels, one
 with a ballroom and swimming pool.    
 There are a number of Guest Houses and
 a Motel.  Close to the beach there are
 two caravan parks, both with full     
 facilities including a pool.  Off the 
 old coast road there is a camping site
 with space for 100 tents and touring  
 caravans.                             
   On the main Seaside Car Park, which 
 has space for 154 cars, there is a    
 Tourist Information Centre, next door 
 to a Motor Cycle Museum which has     
 amongst it's exhibits a motor cycle
