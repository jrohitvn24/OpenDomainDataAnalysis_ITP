		<content>    Many of the farms in our area are  
 owned by the{National Trust,}and the  
 farmers have secure tenancies,        
 although their way of life can be     
 harsh and demanding. Long hours of    
 work are common, and this affects     
 family life. Families find that free  
 time is at a premium, and much of     
 their coming together as a family is  
 through work, rather than leisure     
 activities, e.g. everyone helps at    
 haytime, gathering and shearing.      
    Even leisure pursuits are often    
 related to farming e.g. following the 
{Coniston foxhounds.}Wives are often   
 earners of extra income through "bed  
 and breakfast". Although home life in 
 its traditional sense is often        
 limited, these fell families have a   
 unity of purpose which many might     
 envy. Quarrying families have a more  
 regular, but similar life style.      </content>
