		<content> BAPTIST CHAPEL.                       
 There is a small Baptist Chapel in the
 High Street in Teversham.  The date   
 above the door shows 1858, presumably 
 this is the date of building. It is   
 constructed of the same local brick as
 are the terraced cottages on each side
 of it.                                
 HOLYCROSS CHURCH.                     
 Leaving Teversham and onto the A 45   
 road going towards Cambridge one comes
 to the Holycross Church, C. of E.,    
 almost opposite the City cemetry. This
 is a modern building of red brick,    
 built as a 'daughter' church to the   
 Parish church of Fen Ditton.          
     In the City cemetry, mentioned    
 above, is a small 'Chapel' used almost
 exclusively for funerals.             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
