		<content>{The Rev.D.Martin}was ordained 14 years
 ago. He started as the curate of      
 Sedgely , then became Rector of All   
 Saints, Worcester before coming to {  
{St.Mary's Church, Madresfield.}He     
 performs about 40-50 weddings per     
 year, and holds 10-11 funerals per    
 year. He enjoys his work. There has   
 been a church in Madresfield since    
 before 1852. The first church ( a     
 Norman building ) was dismantled in   
 1852, and a new church erected on the 
 same site, which is now marked by a   
 stone cross. This church only survived
 12 years, due to faulty foundations.  
 The present church was erected on a   
 new site using materials from the     
 second church. It was consecrated in  
 1867.                                 
 By Thomas Walker and Michael Parsons.
