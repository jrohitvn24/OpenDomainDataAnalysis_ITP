		<title>05SOME RARE BIRDS OF OVERY</title>
		<content> The Avocet is quite a rare bird in    
 many parts of Britain and even here in
 Norfolk.  At Overy Staithe we are     
 lucky enough to have one or two       
 visiting occasionally.  The Avocet is 
 a wader, its colour is black and white
 and it has a long curved beak which it
 uses to probe for food in the mud and 
 sand.  The Heron is quite popular in  
 Norfolk but is still a rarity in most 
 of Britain.  Herons are also waders   
 and their food is fish.  Sometimes    
 they have been known to steal goldfish
 from people's ponds.  The species of  
 gull and Overy are the Great          
 Black-backed Gull, the Herring Gull,  
 Black-headed Gull and Lesser          
 Black-Backed Gull.  They are all      
 scavengers.  The Terns that nest on   
 Scolt Head Island near Overy are:     
 Arctic Tern, Common Tern and Sandwich 
 Tern.                                 </content>
