		<content>    The area is crossed by two main    
 roads though neither is very busy.    
 The Penrith to Wigton route across the
 North East corner carries goods from  
 and to Silloth and Wigton from all    
 parts of the country.  Local traffic  
 comprises farm feeds and stock move-  
 ment to and from local markets.       
    Cattle imported from Ireland       
 through Silloth docks pass through at 
 certain times of the year.            
    There is now only one bus a week on
 market day to the local town of Wigton
 However mobile shops visit the village
 on three days a week.  A grocer and a 
 baker visit twice and a butcher once. 
    Parkhead Limestone Quarry is at    
 present open and run by a company from
 the North East of England.  A small   
 tonnage of stone is processed and used
 by farmers and contractors for road   
 building.                             </content>
