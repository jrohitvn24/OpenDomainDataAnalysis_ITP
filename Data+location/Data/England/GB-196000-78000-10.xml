		<content>  Men on the Lifeboat have to wear a   
 rubber suit which goes from their feet
 to their neck,and they wear a jacket  
 and cap to protect them.Once John and 
 two others had to go to the bottom of 
 the cliff and rescue a doctor who had 
 fallen over and broken his back his   
 two legs and one of his wrists.       
 Instead of him being in a wheelchair  
 for the rest of his life,he was       
 walking again.                        
  The Lifeboat would be at the bottom  
 of the cliff if one of the cliff      
 rescue team happened to fall.         
  If the Lifeboat was needed two rocket
 maroons would be fired everybody in   
 the Lifeboat should run down to the   
 Lifeboat house. The first three there 
 get there suits on and go on the      
 rescue .Then we go as fast as we can  
 on the rescue.
