		<content> We interviewed three people in yates  
 ave to find  out about their cars. We 
 also went Norman road and Quarry      
 close.Every one we visited had a car. 
 Most people like their car and need   
 them to get to one place or another.  
 The most popular make of car was a    
 ford, either sierra or cortina. A lot 
 of people have special nicknames for  
 their cars. None of the people we     
 interviewed had new cars, in fact the 
 average age of the cars was 15 years  
 of age. When asked if they thought    
 their car was good value, all of them 
 thought they had got a fair deal.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
