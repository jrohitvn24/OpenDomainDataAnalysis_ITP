		<title>11HUNTING ETC.AROUND DUNSFORD.</title>
		<content> This area and others around it were in
 the past owned by local squires.The   
 land was used for farming but the     
 owner retained hunting,shooting and   
 fishing rights.These activities still 
 give pleasure to many people. The     
 local foxhunt meets and there are     
 other hunts.Shoots for pheasants are  
 organised and there is fishing in the 
 River Teign.Pheasants are bred then   
 set free but rabbits,hares,foxes and  
 deer breed naturally and take their   
 food from the wild but occasionally   
 when their natural food is scarce they
 will spoil crops or kill stock.Some   
 form of control then becomes necessary
 A local farmer whose land adjoins an  
 area of woodland said "I like deer.   
 They do little damage but when the    
 numbers increase and they become a    
 nuisance we enjoy a joint of vension."
