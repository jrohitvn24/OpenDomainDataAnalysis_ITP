		<title>18The River Avon at Hanham.</title>
		<content> The River Avon,below Hanham Court is  
 popular for recreation.There are two  
 pubs which overlook the lock and weir 
 and are stops for boat trips from     
 Bristol Docks.The area is also called 
 Hanham Mills because it was the site  
 of a corn or grist mill for over 800  
 years,probably built by the monks of  
 Keynsham Abbey.Londonderry Wharf,once 
 known as "Jacky Whites"is further down
 river towards Bath. Rings were set    
 into the walls of Bath stone for      
 mooring. It is now hard to trace      
 the course of the sidings except where
 the branch rose to join the Avon Wharf
 line near Willsbridge where earthworks
 are clear.Horse drawn wagons and      
 trains would have transported coal to 
 barges where it could be shipped      
 around England.Now it is used as a    
 picnic spot.
