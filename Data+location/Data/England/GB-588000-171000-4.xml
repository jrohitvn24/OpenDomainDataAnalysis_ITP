		<content>    In Rushenden it is sometimes good  
 fun but sometimes it is boring. I play
 on my bike or skates. I wish it had an
 ice-rink like Gillingham. I play round
 the shops and in the playing field    
 with my sister and friends. We like to
 play{Sticky Toffee.                   
    You start with one person crossing 
 their hands and all the others each   
 hold a finger. Then she calls out all 
 the names of the people holding her   
 fingers. When she gets to the last one
 they all run away. If she catches one 
 of them they have to stand still with 
 their arms out until another person   
 crawls between their legs and releases
 them.                                 
    I hardly ever watch television. I  
 mostly play in my spare time.
