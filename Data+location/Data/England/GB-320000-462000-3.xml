		<title>03PIEL CASTLE</title>
		<content> Piel Castle was built in the 12th     
 century by the monks of nearby Furness
 Abbey.It was built as a point to      
 prevent smuggling from Scotland and   
 Ireland.However,the Monks used this as
 an excuse to smuggle goods            
 themselves.Piel was also a garrison to
 help prevent foreign                  
 invasions,especially from Scotland.   
 In 1327,the Monks rebuilt the castle  
 with a great keep and inner and outer 
 baileys.In 1487,a rival to King Henry 
 7th , called Lambert Simnel,landed at 
 Piel with a force of 8000 men.He      
 attempted to take the throne but he   
 was unsuccessful.With the dissolution 
 of Furness Abbey in 1537 the castle   
 has steadily passed into ruin.It is   
 now possible to visit the castle if   
 you take the Ferry from Roa Island.
