 I DID A SURVEY ON MUSIC WITH ALL THE  
 FIRST YEAR PUPILS, WHO ARE 12 YEARS   
 OLD.                                  
 THESE ARE THE RESULTS, FROM ABOUT 100 
 PUPILS.                               
 27 PUPILS SAID THAT THEY PLAY A       
 MUSICAL INSTRUMENT                    
  9 PUPILS PLAY A{WOODWIND INSTRUMENT  
  3 PUPILS PLAY A{BRASS INTRUMENT      
  4 PUPILS PLAY A{PERCUSSION INSTRUMENT
  9 PUPILS PLAY A{STRINGED INSTRUMENT  
 100 PUPILS LISTEN TO{"POP"}MUSIC      
 10 PUPILS SING IN A CHOIR             
 55 PUPILS SING IN THE HOME            
 THERE ARE NOT MANY PUPILS THAT PLAY   
 INSTRUMENTS, BUT THERE ARE LOTS OF    
 PUPILS THAT LISTEN TO MUSIC.  NOT MANY
 PUPILS SING IN THE CHOIR, BUT LOTS OF 
 PUPILS SING IN THE HOME.              
  MUSICAL YOUTH IS A WELL KNOWN {POP } 
 GROUP.                                </content>
