		<content> The people of this area like both the 
 rural atmosphere and the convenience  
 of good road and rail links with      
 places of employment and amenities.   
 However, several people suggested ways
 in which the quality of life could be 
 improved such as better pavements,    
 restrictions on dogs, a local police- 
 man to prevent rubbish dumping and    
 vandalism, and the end of further     
 building development.The major        
 complaint was that there were no local
 facilities for the large numbers of   
 teenagers who have grown up here. But 
 the people who chose to move here to  
 provide a pleasant home life for their
 families are generally satisfied and  
 have no desire to move away.
