I get up in the morning and go and see 
if my mum and dad are awake.  Then I   
will go back to bed and read a book.   
In five minutes mummy comes in to my   
bedroom and tells me to get up and get 
dressed.  When I have done that I will 
go downstairs and have my breakfast of 
Rice Crispies and two pieces of toast. 
After that I will go upstairs and wash 
my hands and face then I will brush my 
teeth then I will go downstairs and    
get my school bag ready for school.    
When I have got my bag ready for       
school I will ring Kirstie up to see   
how we are getting down to school.     
When I have talked to Kirstie I will   
brush my hair and then go to school.   
When I get to school I will wait in    
the playground until the bell goes.    
Then we will all go to Assembly.
