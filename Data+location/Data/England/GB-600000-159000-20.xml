		<content> Faversham,while aware of its past is  
not always limited by it.Once an       
important market town and port it      
functions today as a low order service 
centre.                                
 Shopping is dominated by convenience  
goods and there is intense competition 
from other towns.Some fear that        
Faversham is becoming a village,       
although market stalls have brought    
some hustle back to the centre.        
 Industry,once varied and important is 
now declining but the breweries still  
thrive.Population growth is slow,      
limited by the Kent structures plan,and
the town remains on the fringe of the  
commuter belt.                         
 Much has been done to preserve the    
past in Faversham but LONDON still has 
a strong influence on the town that    
lies in a rich fruit and vegetable belt
between the down and the marshes.      </content>
