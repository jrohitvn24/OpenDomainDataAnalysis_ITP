		<title>16ROSEHILL SCHOOL, RAWMARSH</title>
		<content>   Our school was built in 1911 and is 
 built of red brick.  It is the largest
 primary school in Rawmarsh, this means
 it has the largest number of children.
 It used to have eight classrooms round
 the hall but now it has only seven. In
 the mid 1960s extensions were built   
 on.  They were the indoor toilets, the
 headmaster's office, the medical      
 office and two more classrooms.  One  
 of the original classrooms was        
 converted into a P.E. equipment area. 
 There have been three headmasters     
 since 1911.  They were Mr. Ingham, Mr.
 Bedford and Mr. Branston.  Our present
 headmaster has been here since 1965,  
 which is just 20 years.  In the year  
 ending July, 1985 there are two first 
 year, two second year, two third year 
 and three fourth year classes.  This  
 year 72 fourth year pupils are leaving
 to go to three comprehensive schools. </content>
