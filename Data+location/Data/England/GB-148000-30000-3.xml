		<title>03A DAY IN THE LIFE OF EMMA..2</title>
		<content> Sometimes we have Games or listen to  
 poems and stories. Each day we have a 
 play-time at 10.30 a.m. and at        
 2.30 p.m. We have another break at    
 mid-day for a meal, either a packed   
 lunch or a lunch made in the school   
 canteen. When we have finished l play 
 in the school field or play-ground or 
 on the patio. On Mondays I have a     
 recorder lesson which I enjoy.        
 Sometimes I play the bass xylophone.  
 The bus collects us at 3.45 p.m. each 
 day. When I get home I tell my Mum    
 about my day at school. We have tea   
 and I watch television, or play with  
 my friends or go to dancing lessons.  
 At 8.00 p.m. I have a bath and get    
 ready for bed at 9.00 p.m. Before I go
 to sleep I have a good read.
