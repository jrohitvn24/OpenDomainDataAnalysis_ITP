		<content>                                       
 This part of North_East Leicestershire
 is mainly an arable farming area.     
                                       
 Crops grown include wheat, barley,    
 oats, and some oil seed rape.  These  
 are grown on the south_eastern slope  
 from the main plateau above Ragdale   
 Village.                              
                                       
 Mixed with the crops on the south_    
 eastern slopes there is intensively   
 managed grassland.  Such grassland is 
 also to be found in the valley through
 which the Ox Brook runs.              
                                       
 Enclosed rough grazing is to be found 
 in the quite deep valley to the north_
 east and also on the slopes as the    
 valley rises to the north_east end of 
 the plateau.                          
                                       </content>
