		<content>{St. Michael's College,}a very well    
 known Preparatory Choir School of high
 repute in the musical world, founded  
 by Sis Frederick Ousley in 1856, sadly
 closed  on July 14th.1985. The number 
 of pupils required to make the school 
 financially viable was at least 80 and
 at closure had fallen to 47 boys and  
 girls in the Preparatory school and 18
 in the Pre-Preparatory Department.    
 Despite tremendous efforts by the     
 Warden,the  Revd. A.F.Walters, his    
 Staff and pupils parents to reverse   
 the trend the numbers had fallen      
 consistently over the previous five   
 years and the Governors had no        
 alternative but to close the school.
