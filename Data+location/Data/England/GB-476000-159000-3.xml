		<title>03Eversley Folk-dance Club</title>
		<content>    The Folk-dance Club was founded in 
 1929 by a group of people including   
 the lady we talked to, Mrs. Yeomans.  
 She told us that there were fifteen   
 members then but now there are about  
 forty. Before they acquired their     
 gramophone they danced to a comb and  
 tissue-paper band. The entry fee was  
 6d but now everyone brings 25p.       
    The club meets every second Tuesday
 in the village hall and their caller  
 is also secretary. The club performs  
 twice a year, once in the summer and  
 once at Christmas. The members' ages  
 range from twenty-one to over forty.  
 The club often meets with other clubs 
 in the area for a pleasant social     
 evening.
