		<title>20Problems of the area</title>
		<content> The main problem that people in the   
 area were concerned with was not being
 able to get into Cheltenham and       
 Tewksbury. Bus services have been cut,
 a private bus service does operate,but
 it does not give a realy good service,
 people must rely on cars. School      
 children have to go long distances on 
 a school bus. There are no shops in   
 the villages, this is a great         
 disadvantage. There are few           
 entertainments, this is particularly  
 hard on the young. One person said    
 "Living her is a pain in the neck",   
 but others like the peace of the      
 countryside. They fear any plan to    
 build any large estate or factory in  
 the area. Some people resent the      
 motorway which splits the area and    
 makes a continual drone. Most people  
 liked living in the area.
