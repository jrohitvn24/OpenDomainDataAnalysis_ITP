		<content> We do not have a police station in our
 area but come under the control of    
 Liskeard station. At night the control
 is based at Launceston. Villages have 
 been given their own{community        
{constable}who takes  special care of  
 his area. His duty day usually runs   
 from 9 a.m.to 5 p.m., but sometimes he
 works in the evenings. The area is    
 usually quiet but one problem is      
{vandalism.}A large amount of damage   
 has been done in the last year. Local 
 people say that it happens because we 
 do not have a policeman living in the 
 village. To help beat the vandals each
 Community Constable now has the help  
 of a Sergeant. The policemen in our   
 area are part of the{Devon and        
{Cornwall Constabulary.}They patrol the
 area in cars and keep in touch by     
 radio.
