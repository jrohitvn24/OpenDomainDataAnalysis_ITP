		<content>    The area mainly consists of gently 
{undulating ground}rising to{120-130m.}
 Most of the soils are of glacial      
 origin and were created by extensive  
 deposition of{sands, clays and gravels
 as ice melted at the end of the Ice   
 Age.                                  
                                       
    There is a{broad, flat floored     
{valley}running in a N.N.W-S.S.E       
 direction towards the south-western   
 margin of the area. This may well have
 been formed by glacial melt-water. Man
 has made use of this{natural routeway 
 since it is occupied by the{Shropshire
{Union Canal (Llangollen Branch).}The  
 canal is a major feature of this      
 sparsely populated area.
