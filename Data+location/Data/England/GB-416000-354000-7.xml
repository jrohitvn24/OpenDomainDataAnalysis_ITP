		<content> My dad's shop is called Old Farmhouse 
 furniture. He's got three people who  
 come to work at about 8 o'clock and go
 at half past five. There are another  
 three people who work part-time.      
 My dad or someone who is part-time do 
 pine-stripping to get the old paint of
 the furniture.                        
 There are two vehicles, a car and a   
 van for deliveries.                   
 My dad now does fitted kitchens out of
 pine. Our shop is actually an old farm
 barn.                                 
 Keith works most of the time making   
 pine furniture. My dad makes quite a  
 lot of dressers. Roger is the best.   
 He's been here nearly as long as my   
 dad in the shop.                      
 I'm going to work in my dad's         
 workshop.
