		<content> Most of our parents are working in    
 Caring Jobs.These include nurses and  
 care assistants in hospitals, Social  
 Services' attendants, home helpers,   
 and a school transport attendant for  
 a special school. We live close to the
 General Hospital and also to the Giant
 Mental Hospital at Winwick which is   
 one of the biggest employers in the   
 area.                                 
                                       
 Some of our parents are in service    
 jobs like car repairing,lorry mending,
 serving in shops,clerking and driving.
 No body did an actual manufacturing   
 job but one is a packaging worker and 
 the lorry driver works for a brewery. 
 Only two parents are self employed.   
 One fits double glazing and the other 
 is a taxi driver.
