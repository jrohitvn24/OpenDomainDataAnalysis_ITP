		<title>19Home Life in Melchbourne</title>
		<content> The twelve working households in      
 Melchbourne are of necessity two car  
 families. One particular housewife    
 drives 280 miles a week, taking       
 children to and from school and their 
 various activities and doing the      
 weekly shopping.                      
 This particular family moved into the 
 village 3 years ago and concentrated  
 all their efforts into restoring their
 old farmhouse to its original state,  
 taking great care to maintain its     
 charm and character. The old bread    
 oven was discovered whilst            
 replastering and the original kitchen 
 floor tiles were removed and carefully
 replaced after damproofing.           
 The warmth of this timber framed      
 building is reflected in the happiness
 of the family and the scene of        
 children playing, the pet ducks       
 contemplating their pond. Idyllic.    </content>
