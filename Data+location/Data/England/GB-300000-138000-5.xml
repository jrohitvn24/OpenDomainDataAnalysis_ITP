		<title>05WORKING ON A DAIRY FARM.</title>
		<content> Joanne Fosters dad is a dairy farmer  
 and he gets up about five o'clock in  
 the morning.  He milks the friesian   
 cows and sends the milk off. He feeds 
 the cows on cake and kale as well as  
 hay and  silage. Mr Foster and his    
 friend Andrew start milking at 6 a.m. 
 They go to the fields to gather the   
 cows up and drive them into the       
 milking parlour. At 7 a.m. a tanker   
 comes from Wellington to collect the  
 milk and then it goes to other farms. 
 After he has milked the cows he has to
 clean the parlour out. Then he takes  
 all of the cows out and puts them back
 into the field. He puts all of the    
 electric fences on so the cows won't  
 escape and then he makes sure that the
 grass is all right to eat. He also has
 to milk the cows again in the evening.
 Each cow gives 6 litres of milk at a  
 time.                                 </content>
