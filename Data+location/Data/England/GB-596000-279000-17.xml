		<title>17ICE-CREAM MAKING, HOPTON</title>
		<content> Thompsons started selling ice-cream   
 three years ago as the milk from their
 six cows was not enough to sell by    
 itself.  On average there are three   
 helpers.  The ice-cream is made in    
 the dairy by mixing together milk,    
 cream, egg-yolk, sugar and powdered   
 milk and  heating to pasteurise it.   
 Then it is put in a machine that beats
 and freezes it. All the ingredients   
 are home produced and as natural as   
 possible.  They make strawberry,      
 chocolate, vanilla, coffee and walnut 
 and rum and raisin flavours; vanilla  
 is the most popular.  Ten gallons can 
 be made at once in five to six hours. 
 Ice-cream costs Â£1.85 for one litre.  
 The product is sold to shops, hotels  
 and restaurants locally and to fairs  
 on a Victorian style stand. The       
 busiest time is in the summer         
 especially on Saturdays.              </content>
