		<title>14FISH IN ABBERTON RESERVOIR</title>
		<content> Abberton Reservoir is an ideal habitat
 for freshwater fish. Plantlife and    
 insects are abundant, providing food  
 for a large population. Angling takes 
 place on those banks of the reservoir 
 which are not too steep.              
 All common species of fish are        
 represented: Pike, Perch, Roach,      
 Tench, Eel and Bream. Some of the fish
 are very large. Pike have been seen   
 that are as large as a ten year old   
 boy is tall and as thick as a man's   
 thigh. The maximum weight of a pike   
 caught in the reservoir is 33 pounds. 
 In the summer months algae forms over 
 a large area of the surface of the    
 water and this nourishes the insect   
 population and in turn benefits the   
 fish.
