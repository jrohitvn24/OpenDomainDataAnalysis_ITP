 The farmhouse,situated opposite       
 Harford church,is 18th century.Its    
 water supply comes off of the moor.   
 Eric Pearse came here to live in 1962 
 He has been farming for 50 years,     
 having taken over from his father.He  
 starts work at 6.00am and finishs at  
 5.00pm.He has 150 acres on which he   
 keeps 78 breeding cows and 25         
 followers(young breeding cattle).The  
 breeds are Hereford crossed with      
 Galloway and Limousine crossed with   
 Galloway.He chose them for their      
 ability to withstand the tough Dart-  
 moor weather.He also keeps sheep.     
 He does not grow crops,except hay,    
 which he feeds to the animals.His     
 favourite job is feeding the cattle,  
 and his worst is cleaning out the pig 
 houses.He has now given up pig-keeping
 and concentrates on cattle and sheep. </content>
