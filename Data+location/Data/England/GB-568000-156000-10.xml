 facilities and well-kept sports       
 grounds at Cobdown (Ditton) for its   
 employees and pensioners. Other

 running costs. A new clubhouse was    
 built in 1985 for Reed Int. Sports and

 used has been taken over by Reed      
 Catering Services. The new premises   
 include a room for dances, discos and 
 dinner parties. There is a kitchen,   
 meeting room and 4 changing rooms. The
 "77" Pavilion has a laundry for kit,  
 dining room/kitchen for teams catering
 for themselves, and 10 changing rooms.

 6 football, 4 cricket &amp; 4 hockey      
 pitches, 6 tennis courts, 2 bowling   
 greens and a nine-hole golf course.
