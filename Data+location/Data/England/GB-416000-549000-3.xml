		<title>03OUR SCHOOL DAY</title>
		<content> Before 9 o'clock we put our dinner    
 cards in and go out to play.Later in  
 class we do spellings and sometimes we
 race with our teacher.On Fridays we   
 present badges and House shields.     
    When it's Maths we do good things  
 like Fractions.Children who haven't   
 done enough work stay in.After play   
 it's Swimming and we go in a Watson's 
 bus to meet Mrs Hill at Catchgate.Next
 we return for dinner,will it be nice  
 or horrible? On Friday lunchtimes we  
 play records.                         
 What will it be next? We'll have to   
 wait and see.We could be doing the {  
{Domesday Project.}After play we have  
 Games,T.V.Music or Craft.At hometime  
 if we've had 100% all week we go home 
 10 minutes earlier.                   
 A day in school is never boring.
