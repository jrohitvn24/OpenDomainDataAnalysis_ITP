		<title>19Shopping in Newark</title>
		<content>       When a survey was taken on the  
 shopping in Newark, both men and women
 were interviewed but the men felt they
 were unable to comment on the shopping
 facilities because they rarely do     
 the shopping for their household. The 
 general view was that there are a     
 sufficient number of shops in most    
 categories except clothes. Also more  
 teenage shops are needed. The market  
 is popular and is thought to be very  
 well equipped with plenty of variety  
 of stalls.  Food is very cheap on the 
 market. Most people prefer to use     
 supermarkets and shop locally because 
 it is convenient. The most popular    
 shopping days are Wednesday, Friday &amp; 
 Saturday which are market days. Many  
 shops close on Thursday afternoons and
 all but a few (newsagents, Halfords)  
 are closed on Sunday.
