		<title>12Interview: a local resident</title>
		<content>         Mr. Cyril Williams            
 Mr. Willams lived at Home Farm        
 Filleigh when young.  At school he    
 played marbles and hoops in the       
 playground.  There were about 40      
 children in the class.  In class they 
 mainly did reading, sums and writing. 
 There were no meals at school.  The   
 country children brought their own    
 food and ate it outside in the porch. 
 He recalls "I was lucky to get good   
 food.  Some children had very little. 
 Their clothes were very drab by todays
 standards - stiff shirts, collars and 
 dark suits.  There wasn't much fun at 
 school.  We had to work hard doing our
 work on slates and slate pencils and  
 had writing books when we reached the 
 higher standards.  I was rude to the  
 teacher and I had two stripes with the
 cane.  I think you will find this in  
 the record book.                      </content>
