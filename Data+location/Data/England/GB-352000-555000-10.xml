		<content>     There were 4 main events in the   
 1985 Church social calendar; the first
 on 22nd February when a "Tatie Pot"   
 supper, followed by slides, was held  
 in the Watson Institute.   In June a  
 "Songs of Praise" evening was held    
 when Parishioners, led by the WI      
 choir, joined in singing their        
 favourite hymns.                      
                                       
     On 15th June 6 teams competed in  
 the annual Inter-Village Knock Out    
 Competition.  The games vary from     
 year to year - this year it was       
 rounders. Any profits from the        
 associated stalls and teas go to help 
 the running of the Parish Church.     
                                       
     In early October there was the    
 Harvest Supper following the          
 Thanksgiving Service in the Church.
