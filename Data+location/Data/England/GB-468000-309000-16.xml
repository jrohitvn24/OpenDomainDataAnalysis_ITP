		<content>  Research fot this D- Block was       
 carried out by 2B3 students (1985)    
 from Wreake Valley Community College. 
 Most if the research was carried out  
 on two day fieldtrips into the area.  
 these were memmorable days, and       
 despite torrential rainfall on both   
 days good fun was had by all. As a    
 class we would like to thank all the  
 local residents in Barsby and South   
 Croxton who spent theit time talking  
 to us and provided us with the        
 infomation.                           
  The infomation was typed into the    
 computer by Simon Oakes of the sixth  
 form.
