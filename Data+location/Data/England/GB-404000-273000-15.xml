		<content> During the summer term we held a      
 Sponsored Silence for 30 minutes &amp; a  
 Bring &amp; Buy Sale  to raise money for  
 the Bradford Fire Fund. In our Dinner 
 hour we sat in silence thinking about 
 how the fire, started by a cigarette, 
 swept through the football stand      
 killing or injuring many people. We   
 all did the silence! The next day we  
 had the sale. We raised {Â£380. }      
 Our drama group entered the Redditch  
 One Act Play Festival.Our play was    
 called,"The Most Unsuccessful Bank    
 Robbery."One of our girls, Daniella   
 Hunt,wrote and produced the play.We   
 did the lighting and the scenery      
 ourselves with the help of the Palace 
 Theatre staff.We won the Radio Wyvern 
 Drama Cup for the Best Younger        
 Competitors. {M Green }
