		<content>Some games we play in 1985.            
RED ROVER.                             
You need 5 or more people in two       
groups facing each other. You call     
someone over by singing,"RED ROVER,    
RED ROVER, WE CALL (name) OVER." The   
person runs and tries to break through 
the hands, if they do they can take a  
person over to their side, if they     
don't belong to that group. Keep       
playing until no-one remains in the    
other group.                           
BRITISH BULLDOG.                       
Choose 1-3 people to stand in the      
middle of a large area, these people   
have to try to catch the remaining     
people, who can only run across the    
ground when told to do so. When        
captured you may put up a fight, but   
when lifted off the ground you must    
help your captors. The game continues  
until everyone is caught.              </content>
