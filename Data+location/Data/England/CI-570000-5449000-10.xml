    Gorey harbour is a lively and      
 friendly place, with its little       
 fishing boats and yachts. It is one of
 the most popular places where lots of 
 holiday-makers visit. It has a wide   
 variety of sea-birds, ranging from    
 herring-gulls to oyster-catchers, and 
 there are lots of locals trying a spot
 of fishing. Gorey harbour also has its
 own cafes, shops and restaurants which
 are much praised for their shellfish, 
 including crabs, lobsters, oysters,   
 mussels and langoustines.             
    There are coach tours, visits to   
 Mont Orgueil Castle, and at night time
 it is a pleasure to see the castle    
 completely floodlit and the lights of 
 the shops and houses reflecting in the
 water.
