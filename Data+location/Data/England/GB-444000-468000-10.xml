		<title>10GAMES CHILDREN PLAY,PART 2</title>
		<content>{ Apart from the usual sort of games   
{that children play outside such as    
{cricket,rugby and soccer (association 
{football) there are also the more     
{imaginative sort such as Blocky 1-2-3,
{War,Gestapo,British Bulldogs and      
{Harris Hunts.                         
{  Blocky 1-2-3 is a game that requires
{one person to have a block or base.The
{other players are given time to hide. 
{The Blocky is supposed to move from   
{his post to give the other players a  
{chance to return to the Block and     
{shout Blocky 1-2-3 and their name.    
{  Harris Hunts is a game that requires
{one player to get into a rage and run 
{away carrying something valuable to   
{the other players. If they manage to  
{catch him within ten minutes then he  
{has to pay a forfeit; if the children 
{are very rough they may make him hold 
{a nettle for five seconds.            </content>
