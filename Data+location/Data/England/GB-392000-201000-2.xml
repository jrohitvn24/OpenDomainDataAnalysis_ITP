		<content>  We like living in the country because
 there is a lot of open space and its  
 very green everywhere. You can go     
 exploring and play where there is no  
 one to disturb you. I expect when we  
 are older we will want to go to discos
 and things like they do in Stroud but 
 at the moment its much better as it   
 is. The nice thing about the country  
 is that everybody knows everyone else,
 which is very nice for the children.  
 When we are in trouble we know that we
 can go to anyone for help. When new   
 people move into the village they very
 soon meet everyone else and the       
 children soon make new friends. For a 
 small village there is quite a lot to 
 do if you are a grownup, too. There   
 are lots of clubs to join. We must    
 take care of country villages so that 
 everyone can enjoy them.
