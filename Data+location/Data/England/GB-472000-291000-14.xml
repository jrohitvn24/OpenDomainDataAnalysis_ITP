		<content>   You need a car if you live in this  
 area because there are no shops. Our  
 nearest train service is in Market    
 Harborough.If you want to go to London
 you would go to Harborough to catch a 
 bus or train.Lots of people use       
 bicycles.There are very few buses     
 going through our villages.A few go   
 daily to Market Harborough,but not on 
 Sundays.
