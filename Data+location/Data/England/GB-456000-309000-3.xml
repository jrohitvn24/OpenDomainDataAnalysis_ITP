		<title>03A NEW FAMILY IN BIRSTALL</title>
		<content> We moved here a month ago because my  
 Dad, who is a manager, was getting    
 tired of driving down here every day  
 from{Chesterfield.}We had only one    
 car, a Cortina, which was expensive to
 run.                                  
    At 8.30 on Sunday, we get up, eat  
 breakfast and drive to Chesterfield on
 the M1 in our{Morris 1000.}We go to my
 auntie's and my nanan's house. After  
 lunch we go to the Parish Church      
 Cricket Club. I am the scorer until   
 3.20 when I make the teas and my      
 friend takes over the scoring. This   
 has caused some interest at my new    
 school because I am a girl and I know 
 more about cricket than the boys! At  
 6.00 the game ends and we all go to   
 the{Cricketer's Inn.}Later we have a  
 sandwich at my nanan's and by 7.30 we 
 are back on the motorway to Leicester.
