		<title>10FARMING IN THE AREA</title>
		<content>  The Barford - Burcombe area is gently
 hilly chalkland. The open countryside 
 is predominately arable. Mainly cereal
 growing is practised on a             
 non-rotational basis, being totally   
 dependent on fertilizers and chemical 
 sprays.                               
  Towards the river the land supports  
 livestock, mainly sheep, as the ground
 will not support arable here, although
 this has been attempted in the past.  
  Farming in the area is mainly        
 controlled by large estates, which are
 highly mechanised and employ few      
 workers - tractor drivers and         
 shepherds are among those employed.
