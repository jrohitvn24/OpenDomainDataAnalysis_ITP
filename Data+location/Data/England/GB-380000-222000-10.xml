		<content>THE PROBLEM OF FALLING NUMBERS         
 Sandhurst Church of England Primary   
School faces closure in 1987. At 22 the
number of children on roll is consid-  
ered too small and next year there will
be even fewer. Such small numbers raise
problems, for example there are only 4 
boys in the school football team.      
 The infants are taught in a separate  
temporary classroom and the 16 juniors 
are together in the main schoolroom.   
School dinners are also eaten in this  
room, they are cooked in Gloucester and
brought in daily by a van.             
 All ages mix well, community spirit is
an important result of life in a small 
rural school. This will be lost if the 
children have to travel away to another
school. Unless more families with young
children move to Sandhurst it will be  
impossible to save the school although 
the villagers want to keep it open.    </content>
