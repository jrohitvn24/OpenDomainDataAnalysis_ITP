		<title>09THE VILLAGE OF OTTRINGHAM</title>
		<content> Ottringham has actually decreased in  
 population and is only slowly         
 increasing now, with the development  
 of nearly all the residential         
 buildingland available. The original  
 Ottringham has remained little changed
 for years with its village hall,      
 institute and games room. St. Wilfreds
 church of England towers above the    
 main street, once a large congragation
 sadly depleated as is the Methodist   
 church. Having two public houses, one 
 having a restaurant, two shops and a  
 Post Office, we have some visitors but
 generally it is a village that prefers
 to remain undeveloped and quiet. It   
 has provided well for itself having a 
 playing field and equipment, several  
 clubs and organisations for old and   
 young and a great sense of community  
 spirit.
