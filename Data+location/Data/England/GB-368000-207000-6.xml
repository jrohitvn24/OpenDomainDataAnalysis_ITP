		<content> THE ARRETON COW IS A HUNDRED YEAR OLD 
 TRAMP STEAMER WHICH HAS BEEN PARKED IN
 BULLO PILL HARBOUR FOR THE LAST THREE 
 YEARS.GRADUALLY THE SILT FROM THE     
 RIVER SEVERN LEFT THE ARRETON COW ON A
 SIX FOOT HIGH MUD BANK.THE OWNER,MR   
 STAMP,HAD GOT A CONTRACT FOR DREDGING 
 IN THE BRISTOL CHANNEL AND HAD TO     
 SPEND THREE WEEKS DIGGING THE OLD     
 SHIP OUT.THIS WAS BEING DONE WITH A   
 JCB.MR STAMP HAD SPECIALLY EXTENDED   
 THE ARM BY FOUR FEET TO REACH OVER THE
 SIDE DEEP INTO THE MUD;THE HOLD OF THE
 ARRETON COW WOULD BE USED TO CARRY THE
 MUD FAR OUT INTO THE BRISTOL          
 CHANNEL.THE LAST TIME WE WERE         
 THERE,THE ARRETON COW FLOATED FOR A   
 FEW MINUTES ON THE HIGH TIDE.THE      
 ARRETON COW WAS ABOUT TO START A NEW  
 LIFE.
