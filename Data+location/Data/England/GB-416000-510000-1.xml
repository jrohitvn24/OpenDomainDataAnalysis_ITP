		<content>  At the  start  of  this  century, the
 hamlets of{Stanwick, Carlton}and part 
 of{Forcett}formed part of the         
 extensive estates of the {Duke of     
{Northumberland.}Ten  years after the  
 death of{Eleanor, the Dowager Duchess,
 the farms, lands and houses  were sold
 at an{auction} held in {Darlington} on
{6th. Oct. 1921}and were bought largely
 by the former tenants.These properties
 have,  over the years,  passed down to
 their descendants. {Stanwick Hall} was
 demolished  shortly after the sale and
 only some  ancillary buildings such as
 the {stables and  laundry}still remain
 today; these having been {converted to
{housing.} Only a few  new houses  have
 been built in recent years in Stanwick
 most of the  building work  has  taken
 place in Carlton and Forcett. The{area
{thus  remains} much as it was, {wholly
{rural.}                               </content>
