 Our survey area is rural,             
 predominently farmland used for       
 pasture, crops other than grass and   
 rough grazing. The main residential   
 area is Dunton Bassett, where the     
 local primary school is situated. Most
 of the houses are owner-occupied,     
 detached and over 20 years' old. The  
 area is served by three churches as a 
 joint benefice based at Leire. There  
 is little unemployment within the     
 area, although few people work        
 locally, most travelling to other     
 centres of employment. The roads in   
 the area are mainly country lanes     
 linking the villages and farms. There 
 is one major trunk road (A426) and a  
 motorway (M1), both of which run      
 North/South through our survey area.
