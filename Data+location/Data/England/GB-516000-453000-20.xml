		<content>   Skipsea has an Anglican Church and  
 a Methodist Chapel. The Church stands 
 high at the West end of the village   
 close to Castle Hill. It was first    
 built in 1196,then on an artificial   
 mound, probably from sea cobbles which
 had been taken from the nearby castle 
 which was demolished in 1220.The style
 is Early English, with a chancel nave,
 side aisles and tower. It holds 250   
 but the present congregation is about 
 20, plus a Sunday  School of 12 run by
 Miss Ulliott. The  vicar is Rev.John  
 Simson.The Wesleyan methodist chapel  
 was built in 1910 on the site of the  
 original built in 1848. It holds 90 &amp; 
 has a regular congregation is about   
 20. There used to be a Congregational 
 Church built in 1801 but this has gone
 now.There was also a strong Quaker    
 group in the C18th.Where they met is  
 still called Quaker House.            </content>
