		<title>07 Knowle Fields Garage</title>
		<content>  The Knowle Fields Garage is situated 
near Weethley and owned by Mr. Gee.It  
opens at about half past seven untill  
quarter to seven at night,but on       
Sundays it opens at eight and closes at
one in the afternoon.As they live on   
the premises Mr.and Mrs.Gee start work 
as soon as they get up.                
  The customers are mainly just passers
by,but some local people also use the  
garage.As well as selling petrol and   
cars they do repairs and hire out      
vehicles.Petrol brings the most money  
especially in the summer.              
  Originally the site was a farm,then a
transport cafe,then the Gees turned it 
into a garage,but they still kept nine 
acres of land.They have two employees; 
one to work the petrol pumps and the   
other to help in the workshop.
