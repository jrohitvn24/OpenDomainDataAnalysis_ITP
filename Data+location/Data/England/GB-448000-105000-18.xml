		<content>  We did a survey on employment.We went
 round the classes and asked the       
 children what their parents do for a  
 job.                                  
  More women seem to have a{part_time }
 job than men,but more men seem to have
 a{full_time}job than women. 35% of men
 and 45% of women have a part_time job.
 95% men and 22% women do a full_time  
 job.In most familes{both parents}work.
 Interestingly,there were quite a few  
 men who had both a full and part-time 
 job. The most common jobs were those  
 involving{skilled work,health,navy}and
{marine workers}.Most of the skilled   
 workers work at Ford in Eastleigh.    
 There are a lot of marine workers     
 because we are near big rivers and the
 sea.                                  
{ Unemployment}is quite low compared to
 some other areas.Only 3% of parents   
 were unable to find employment.       </content>
