		<content> There nare no facilities within the   
 block for education of the 11+ group, 
 the majority who travel daily by bus  
 to the Comprehensive School at        
 Wells-next-the-Sea some 6 miles from  
 the village.  A sixth-form centre for 
 A-level studies is available at       
 Fakenham High School, again 6 miles   
 away, and a daily bus is provided.    
 The Norfolk College of Arts &amp;         
 Technology at Kings Lynn (22 miles    
 distant) offers a wide range of       
 further education opportunities, and  
 training in practical skills for the  
 16+ age group.  Students are collected
 by bus from the village.  A varied    
 selection of evening classes is       
 available at the above mentioned      
 centres, but no transport is provided.
  There are Public Libraries at Wells  
 and Fakenham, and a mobile library    
 visits the village once a month.      </content>
