MANY OF THE GAMES CHILDREN PLAY        
IN THE PLAYGROUND ARE GAMES THAT  HAVE 
BEEN TAUGHT TO THEM BY OLDER CHILDREN. 
THESE GAMES HAVE NEVER BEEN WRITTEN    
DOWN SO THE WORDS CAN OFTEN DIFFER     
SLIGHTLY FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION.
THE CHILDREN USUALLY STAND IN A CIRCLE 
HOLDING HANDS,THEN THEY MOVE AROUND IN 
A CLOCKWISE DIRECTION CHANTING THE     
WORDS AS THEY MOVE AROUND.MANY OF THE  
GAMES HAVE AN HISTORICAL THEME, SUCH AS
RING A RING O ROSES AND LONDON BRIDGE  
IS BURNING DOWN. THIS TYPE OF GAME WAS 
ONCE VERY POPULAR BUT NOW THEY ARE     
DYING OUT BECAUSE CHILDREN HAVE MANY   
MORE THINGS TO OCCUPY THEM SUCH AS     
TELEVISION AND COMPUTERS.IF A          
GENERATION OF CHILDREN DO NOT LEARN    
THESE GAMES THEN THEY WILL BE LOST     
FOREVER WHICH WILL BE VERY SAD.
