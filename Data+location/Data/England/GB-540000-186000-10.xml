 Ilford's industry is centred mainly   
 around Plesseys. They deal with war   
 heads, torpedoes, bombs, engines,     
 parts of planes and parts of          
 boats. Radar is another thing that    
 Plesseys deal with. A radar is        
 something that tracks down guided     
 missiles. They send radar systems and 
 guided missiles all over the British  
 Isles and abroad too. Plesseys employ 
 a large amount of people so it helps  
 keep down unemployment in Ilford.     
 Howard's is a chemical industry that  
 was originally based in Ilford.       
 During the building at Uphall pieces  
 of Roman pottery and coins were       
 found. In 1916 they added Aspirin to a
 long list of pharmaceutical products.
