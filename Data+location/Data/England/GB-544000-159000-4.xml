		<title>04 GREEN BELT-BIRTHDAY WOOD</title>
		<content> {The Metropolitan Green Belt} was     
instituted to protect areas of "Great  
Landscape Value" surrounding urban     
cities and the countryside around. Much
of the attractive woodland in this area
owes its continued existence to this   
legislation.                           
 {Birthday Wood}- on private land at   
Hillside Farm, Rushmore Hill, is a good
example and has one very interesting   
tree within it,a {Californian Redwood},
known locally as {"the Birthday Tree"},
planted to mark the birth of a child,  
children call it the "Punch tree"      
because of its soft, resilient bark.   
The tree is quite a height but not yet 
the size of those in California that   
are over 320 feet high and 3000 years  
old.  The flora in Birthday Wood is    
prolific and some rare specimens such  
as the "Lady Slipper Orchid" have been 
reported.                              </content>
