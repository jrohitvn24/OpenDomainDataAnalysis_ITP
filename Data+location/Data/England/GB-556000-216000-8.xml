		<content> Records show there was a shed for     
 shoeing horses on the site in 1644;   
 also that a smith's shop was pulled   
 down at the beginning of this century.
  The present business probably started
 about that time - mainly for the      
 repair of agricultural machinery.     
 The current proprietor is Norman      
 Furneaux.  He took over the business  
 in l980 from Ernest Clarke with whom  
 he had collaborated on various        
 assignments over the previous 20      
 years.  These included decorative     
{wrought iron work}for churches and    
 cathedrals, notably screens for the   
 Lady Chapel at Bury St. Edmunds       
 Cathedral and railings and roses for  
 the Elizabeth and Mary monument in    
 Westminster Abbey.
