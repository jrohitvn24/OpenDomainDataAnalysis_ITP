		<content> Compton Abdale is a pretty cotswold   
 village that sits in a valley.   A    
 small clean stream splashes along the 
 side of the village road.   At the    
 crossroads in the centre of the       
 village there is a carved stone head  
 of a crocodile with stream water      
 gushing out of its mouth.   From the  
 crocodile a steep path leads up to the
 old church of St.Oswalds.   The old   
 post office is now a house called Ye  
 Old Post House.   The old mill is now 
 disused and someone is now converting 
 it into a house.                      
 There are no young children in Compton
 Abdale and no school.   Most people go
 shopping in either Cheltenham or      
 Cirencester.   The bus goes on        
 Thursday and Saturday to Cheltenham.  
 There is a social club on Thursday    
 nights.
