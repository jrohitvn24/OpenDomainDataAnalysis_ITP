		<title>02The village blacksmith.(2)</title>
		<content> The village{blacksmith}endeavours to  
 keep his prices reasonable and charges
 Â£14-Â£15 regardless of the size of     
 horse. He realizes that if he became  
 too expensive people would hesitate to
 own horses and his business would     
 suffer. He earns a good living by     
 working hard but feels 'brain more    
 necessary than brawn'.                
 His family have planted a chestnut    
 tree for him to stand under but as yet
 it is only 3ft. high!                 
 There used to be 5{forges}in the      
 village but now he is the only one.   
 There has been a long history of the  
 craft in this village. He gives       
{employment}to one                     
{apprentice.}The apprenticeship lasts  
 for 4 years but the apprentice's work 
 is of such a high standard that the   
 blacksmith has asked to become a      
 partner in the business.              </content>
