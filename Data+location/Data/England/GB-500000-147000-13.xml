		<content> Most of the owners in White Lane,     
 Little Warren Close and Chilworth have
 lived there for twenty to thirty      
 years. The main fuels used are gas,   
 oil and electricity. Normally three   
 meals are eaten in the day and the    
 main meal is usually eaten in the     
 evening. A roast is popular on        
 Sundays. The main evening             
 entertainments are television,        
 computing, music and watching video   
 recordings.                           
                                       
 Most people have burglar alarms and   
 safety locks on windows. Dogs and cats
 are the most popular pets, and dogs   
 are sometimes used as guard dogs. The 
 residents own one or two cars mostly  
 of foreign make, although the Rover is
 also popular. The average family size 
 is five, but most of the children have
 either left home, married or got jobs.</content>
