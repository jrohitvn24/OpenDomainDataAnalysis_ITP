 Wormhill Farm is a{175 acre}holding.  
 The farm has been in the Johnson      
 family for over 50 years.{Mr John     
{Johnson,}the present owner,decided to 
 collect old machinery over 20 years   
 ago.Today he has over{30 horse drawn  
{ploughs}the oldest dating to{1710.}   
  Much of the restoration work has been
 done in his own workshop,Mr Johnson   
 having to learn the art of wheelmaking
 from a local wheelwright.             
  There is a large collection of other 
 machinery,household articles and early
 farm tools.                           
  In 1980 the Museum was opened to the 
 public and the money raised is given  
 to the{Hereford College for the Blind}
 to help purchase something useful for 
 the visually handicapped.
