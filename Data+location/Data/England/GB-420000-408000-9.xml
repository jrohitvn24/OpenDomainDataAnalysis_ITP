		<title>09Shopping habits</title>
		<content> The{shopping habits}of the villagers  
 are  investigated  in  order  to      
 understand their importance to the    
 area. Goods chosen were bread  and    
 furniture.{BREAD:}people tended to go 
 to the nearest place as each village  
 had at least one bread shop. This was 
 for freshness and convenience. Other  
 larger  towns  eg.  Huddersfield,     
 Wakefield and Barnsley also influenced
 the purchasing of bread because of    
 competitive prices, specialist shops  
 and convenience of  multi-purpose     
 shopping.{FURNITURE:}these goods are  
 not required as often and are thus    
 obtained  further  afield  because    
 variety, price  and reputation  of    
 suppliers are  more important  than   
 convenience when spending a lot of    
 money. Leeds and Manchester compete   
 for custom.  Delivery  areas  also    
 influence the range of these goods.   </content>
