 In our school we have a recorder group
 and choir. The recorder group play in 
 assembly nearly every day. Sometimes  
 the recorder children go to a festival
 at Devizes. We play different types of
 recorders like a tenor,a treble or a  
 descant. At the moment the top group  
 are playing a piece called Scarborough
 Fair and another one called, "O I did 
 climb a tree-top" which is a German   
 folk song. The choir went to the City 
 Hall on December the 10th 1984 where  
 they sang Christmas Carols. A few of  
 the choir are also in the village     
 church choir.
