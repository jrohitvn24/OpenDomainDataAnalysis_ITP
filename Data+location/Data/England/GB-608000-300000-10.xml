		<title>10THE RAILWAY STATION</title>
		<content>{   Wymondham Railway Station}is       
 small,with 2 platforms, and is not    
 manned. A number of the buildings are 
 let to outside firms and the platform 
 windows are covered with plywood.     
    It is part of the Breckland line,  
 and therefore one of the many stops   
 between Norwich and Cambridge. The    
 Norwich to Liverpool Street trains    
 sometimes stop at Wymondham. The      
 Norwich to Birmingham train passes    
 through but does not stop.            
    The station is used mostly for     
 shunting, where trucks collect Super  
 Shell, Grain and Cement from          
 Whitemore, March and return them to   
 Wymondham for distribution. Shunting  
 times are 7.15 - 8.30 a.m. and 2.45 - 
 5.00 p.m. daily.                      
    There is a manually operated Signal
 Box, where three local men work in    
 shifts.                               </content>
