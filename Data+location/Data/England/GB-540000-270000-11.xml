		<title>11Retirement in Willingham</title>
		<content> There is one retirement home in the   
 village called{Willingham House.}All  
 the residents come from within a      
 fifteen mile radius and they are aged 
 70 and upwards. They have their own   
 rooms and share communal lounge and   
 dining facilities and are looked after
 by a{matron and staff.}The home is set
 in attractive grounds where the       
 residents enjoy sitting out in good   
 weather. The{Friends of Willingham    
{House}help to organise recreational   
 activities and arrange visits to such 
 events as concerts at the local       
 school.                               
 Most of the residents have relatives  
 living locally but there is often no  
 room or facilities for them to be     
 looked after at home.                 
 Some elderly people live in rented    
 accommodation provided by the{Josiah  
{Smith Homes}charity.                  </content>
