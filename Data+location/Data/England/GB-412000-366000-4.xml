		<title>04LEAD MINING IN MONYASH</title>
		<content>{ Monyash}was the centre of the        
 lead-mining industry in the{High      
{Peak}area of Derbyshire.There         
 are about 20 disused shafts and       
 probably many more that have been     
 forgotten about.These are particulaly 
 dangerous.Grassy mounds can be seen in
 many places.These are the remains of  
 the 'deads' _ waste from the old      
 mines.                                
    The{Barmote Court}met at the{Bulls 
{Head}(now The Hobbit Inn) twice a     
 year.{Hillocks and Knotlow Mines}were 
 mined from 1702 until the last half   
 of the 19th century.The village grew  
 because of the lead mining.Local      
 industries grew to support the        
 lead-miners _ candle-makers,          
 rope-makers,blacksmiths and pubs.     
    Mr{Charlie Millington}who died in  
 1968, aged 90, was the last of the    
 Derbyshire lead-miners.               </content>
