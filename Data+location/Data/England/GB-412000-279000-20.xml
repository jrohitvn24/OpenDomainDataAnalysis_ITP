		<title>20Houses and Home Life</title>
		<content> The impression when walking around the
 block is one of quiet, tree lined     
 streets with private houses ranging   
 from small to mansions. There is very 
 little council owned residential      
 property and no council estates. House
 prices vary from Â£28,000 to 100,000   
 and although the majority of houses   
 are 40 to 50 years old there are a    
 number of fairly small modern estates.
 Most houses have gardens of not less  
 than 80 feet and many considerably    
 more. There are a number of three or  
 four storey blocks of flats. These    
 again are privately owned and in the  
 luxury catagory. Retired or single    
 people live here in the main.         
   A door to door survey showed that   
 nearly all homes contained TV, video  
 and home computer and virtually all   
 families owned a car, many owned two.
