		<content>The cutting season lasts from November 
to March (or May at the latest).Only   
the straight lengths can be used for   
fencing.The rest, poor quality known as
'rough wood', is sent to Chartham Paper
Mills for pulp for paper making.The    
woodcutters rely on cutting rough wood 
in the summer.The men take the lengths 
of chestnut back to their yard.They are
then put into bundles of 25 palings and
wired together by special machines to  
sell to firms in Scotland, Nottingham  
and Kent.Much of it is sent back to    
Kent for use as snow fencing           
on the side of motorways and           
highways.The men used a chainsaw and a 
saw bolted on to the front of their old
tractor and driven off the tractor     
engine.The tractor can also be used for
transporting the lengths out of        
inaccessible areas of the wood to      
waiting trucks.                        </content>
