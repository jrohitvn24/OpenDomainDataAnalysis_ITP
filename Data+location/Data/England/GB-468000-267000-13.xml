		<content> THERE ARE NO RESIDENT DOCTORS OR      
 PHARMACISTS AT EITHER HOLDENBY OR     
 SPRATTON, THE NEAREST CHEMIST BEING AT
 KINGSTHORPE THREE MILES AWAY.         
 AT SPRATTON THERE IS A SURGERY HELD IN
 A PRIVATE HOUSE, THESE DOCTORS        
 OPERATING FROM GUILSBOROUGH AND       
 BRIXWORTH.  THEY DO HOWEVER OPERATE A 
 VERY GOOD DRUGS DELIVERY SERVICE,     
 WHICH IS APPRECIATED VERY MUCH BY THE 
 LOCAL OLDER PEOPLE, WHO HAVE NO       
 TRANSPORT. THE MORE ELDERLY CITIZENS  
 ARE MAINLY VERY HEALTHY DUR TO THE    
 SLOWER PACE OF LIFE IN THE COMMUNITY  
 AND ALSO THEY HAVE PLENTY OF FRESH    
 FRUIT AND VEGETABLES GROWN BY THE     
 VILLAGERS.
