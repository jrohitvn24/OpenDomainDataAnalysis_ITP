 A clifftop plateau of 61 feet average.
 Stone hedges devide the fields which  
 average 3 acres.Although two farmers  
 are taking out hedges to make         
 average 10 acre fields.               
 The North west corner of the block    
 is higher and has large boulders      
 scattered about with very little      
 soil and sparse scraggy               
 vegetation.It has probably never      
 been cultivated.                      
 The centre and south has better soil  
 and grows good grass and barley.      
 The buildings are of stone and cob    
 with slate roofs.                     
 Many small concrete buildings were    
 left by the RAF after the second      
 world war                             
 Modern plastic based paint is being   
 increasingly used for protection..
