		<title>11TILLINGTON MILL FARM SHOP</title>
		<content> The farm shop is near Newbold.The     
 farmer grows his own vegetables but he
 buys in his fruit.He always picks     
 fresh vegetables each day.Every       
 morning he gets up about five o'clock 
 to get the fresh vegetables and he    
 opens the shop at eight o'clock sharp.
 The vegetables are still wet with the 
 morning dew.We always enjoy his       
 vegetables and so do the animals.He   
 has cows to look after as well as the 
 shop.Also there are two horses in a   
 field by the river.
