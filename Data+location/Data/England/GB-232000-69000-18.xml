		<title>18Mining In Callington</title>
		<content>{  East Cornwall}was one of the most   
{important mineral mining areas}in the 
 world in the nineteenth century.      
   Mining died and mines fell into     
 disuse when the price of tin slumped. 
   In the late 70s world mineral prices
 rose and mining companies started to  
 prospect new lodes around old mines   
 again. In the Callington area,        
{Southwest Minerals}chose sites at{Haye
{South, Blogsters and Redmoor mines}to 
 prospect.                             
   By the early eightes people became  
 used to seeing mining machinery coming
 into the locality. In 1985 Redmoor    
 took the most promising prospect.     
 Under the{managing directorship of Mr.
{Gerald Pengelly.}South-West continue  
 to peospect with a view to mining in  
 the future.
