		<title>03FARMING ON ALSTON MOOR (1)</title>
		<content> SHEEP.                                
{Scottish Blackface}and{Swaledale}sheep
 are the most popular around Alston    
 Moor because they are the most        
 profitable on hill land.              
 The most popular rams are the         
{Bluefaced Leicester}and Swaledale     
 whose progeny are much sought after   
 by buyers from the south, who come up 
 and buy the lambs cheaper than they   
 could buy a lowland breed. The        
 Bluefaced Leicester is favoured by    
 the farmer whose land is on the       
 lower fells.The ram lambs are usually 
 castrated and sent away to be fattened
 for meat. The Swaledale ram is for the
 farmer with very rough fell land who  
 wants to keep some of the (Gimmer)    
 female lambs to maintain  the numbers 
 in the flock.Sheepdogs are absolutely 
 essential on a hill farm.
