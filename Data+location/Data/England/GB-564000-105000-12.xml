		<title>12Marshland Weather</title>
		<content> The  weather on the levels is         
 constantly changing.It seems          
 unpredictable, even by                
 weathermen.There is quite often some  
 low cloud causing dull weather ,but of
 course you always get the occasional  
 stream of sunshine from the           
 heavens.The wind on the flatlands is  
 strong as there aren't many tall trees
 to shelter you.It is quite dangerous  
 to be out walking on the marshes in a 
 storm as you are very likely to be    
 struck by lightning and seriously     
 injured.In winter the snowy gales whip
 you and dark clouds spread a feeling  
 of depression over the land and the   
 marshes look cold and unwelcome but as
 spring sets in beauty returns, getting
 ready for the hot summer.
