		<content> The children in{KILMINGTON PRIMARY    
{SCHOOL}join children from other       
 village schools in the area for some  
 activities.  This year we have        
 been going to Musbury for sport and   
 games activities with Musbury and     
 Shute Primary Schools.   We have also 
 had a 4-day residential trip to       
 Plymouth with Dalwood School, and have
 combined with other schools for a     
 joint sports day and reorder-playing. 
{SHUTE PRIMARY SCHOOL                  
 There is also a primary school at     
 Shute, the next village.   The school 
 is of similar size and organisation.  
{KILMINGTON PLAYGROUP                  
 A playgroup is run in the village hall
 every Monday morning for children of  
 pre-school age.                       
{SECONDARY SCHOOLS.} At 11, the        
 children usually transfer to Axminster
 Secondary School or Colyton Grammar.  </content>
