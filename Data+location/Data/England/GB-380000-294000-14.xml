		<title>14MOVING TO THE SEISDON AREA?</title>
		<content>   With the difficulties attendant upon
new building there is little           
opportunity for people wishing to move 
into this area except in the village   
of Seisdon itself.   Many of the farm  
cottages are "tied", which means that  
they are not generally available and   
can be occupied only in connection     
with the tenant's employment.   Other  
cottages are occupied by local people  
who have lived in the area all their   
lives and who are likely to remain     
there.   These houses come on the      
market usually only on the death or    
changed circumstances of the occupant. 
   Some houses have been bought and    
modernised by townspeople who wish to  
live in the country and commute to the 
town for work.   However, this is not  
an area of weekend cottages and most   
houses, once  acquired are occupied on 
a permanent basis.                     </content>
