		<content>    We have been talking to Mr.Wells   
 who  is eighty five years old.He says 
 when he was a school boy he played    
 rounders and hopscotch but he never   
 played football.The school did'nt     
 have the big playing field that we    
 have now.There were two doors one for 
 the boys and one for the girls.On the 
 farm he did everything.He has had a   
 milking machine since 1965 but before 
 that all milking was done by hand.He  
 had 4-6 cows which took him 10-15     
 minutes each to milk.He fed some of   
 the milk to the calves.Mr Croft had   
 the bull it was a Lincoln Red.He      
 worked with everything.He went hunting
 foxes on a horse and the horse was    
 called Furious. Mr. Wells also had    
 working horses that did the ploughing.
