		<title>08LOCAL HISTORY OF CORHAMPTON</title>
		<content> Around 70 A.D. Romans landing at      
 Southampton moved inland over         
 Corhampton Down and camped there      
 naming it Beati Mundae (most blessed  
 place in the world).About 200 years   
 ago a woman of low repute waylaid and 
 robbed travellers disposing of the    
 bodies in the well of her cottage. She
 became known as Betty Mundy and the   
 lane is still Betty Mundy's Bottom.   
 The route changed to Sailor's Lane.   
                                       
 The site of an old fortress on        
 Stephen Castle Down has been confirmed
 by aerial photographs.                
                                       
 The Church ceremony of Beating the    
 Bounds (walking the parish boundary)  
 still takes place every spring at     
 Rogationtide.                         
                                       
                                       </content>
