		<title>01CASSOP &amp; QUARRINGTON AREA</title>
		<content> The area is situated East of Durham   
 City.Although it now appears to be    
 rural it was a centre of both coal    
 mining and quarrying until recently.  
 Two limestome quarries are working and
 the last pit closed in 1983.The block 
 is mainly rolling countrside with     
 cattle grazing the hill pastures of   
 the magnesian limestone escarpment    
 and barley growing on the lower       
 land.The two princpal settlements are 
 Cassop &amp; Quarrington Hill,each of     
 around 300 houses.They are mainly     
 council houses built around 1940 as   
 replacments for the colliery housing  
 of around 1850.Old Cassop, a cluster  
 of farms,is the original village and  
 a farm remains in Old Quarrington a   
 ancient settlement.Despite the fact   
 that the villages have few amenities  
 and little employment there is a      
 strong sense of community ,few leave. </content>
