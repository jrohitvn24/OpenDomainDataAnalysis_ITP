		<title>01OUR D-BLOCK</title>
		<content>   Our D-block is situated in the heart
 of rural Devon which is demonstrated  
 by the fact that{farming}is the only  
 industry in the area.                 
                                       
   Amenities are virtually non-existent
 and all people who live in the D-block
 have to travel to the nearest towns to
 supply their daily needs.             
                                       
   In our study of our D-block, we have
 looked at the ways of life of various 
 people - a schoolgirl, a farmer and a 
 village. We have also looked at how we
 live, looking at clothes, food and    
 homes.To finish our study, we looked  
 at farms, collecting information from 
 questionnaires that the children      
 compiled.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
