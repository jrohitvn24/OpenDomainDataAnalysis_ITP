		<title>12PAPWORTH'S STORAGE (ii)</title>
		<content> The cost of storage is worked out on a
 tonnage of square foot basis,per week,
 month or year or at a fixed contract  
 price for up to 3 years.The storage   
 units are laid out in long rows with a
 rail track running alongside each row,
 sunk into the concrete so that lorries
 can pass over easily.80% of the       
 freight comes by rail and is          
 distributed localy by lorry.Fifteen   
 people work at Papworths, all living  
 locally.This includes 8 people from   
 the previous Sugar Beet Factory on the
 site,the general manager, 2           
 secretaries and 5 workmen.A new       
 storage                               
 unit will be ready in October to hold 
 24,000 tonnes of Interventian Wheat.  
 With the river as a boundary to the   
 site on one side,expansion into       
 wharfage is planned.
