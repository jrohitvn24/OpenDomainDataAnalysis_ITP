		<title>03THE PARISH CHURCH.</title>
		<content>   The Parish Church is dedicated to   
{St. Jude,}and is reputed to have been 
 built by the first{Lord Tollemache}in 
 1836 - the same year as the school.   
 It is rather unusual in that it is    
 built North to South instead of East  
 to  West, as is the usual custom for a
 Church.  The reason given for this is 
 that{Admiral Tollemache -}father of   
 Lord Tollemache - wished to walk      
 through his own entrance gates of     
{Tilstone Lodge}and straight into the  
 Church.                               
   It is built of stone with a slated  
 roof - wood panelled on the inside.The
 interior is simply furnished.The organ
 is situated in the balcony at the rear
 of the Church.                        
   The present incumbent is the{Rev. A.
{Reece}who became Vicar of the Parish  
 in 1980 following the death of the    
 previous Vicar -{Canon A.D. James.    </content>
