		<content> This factory was founded in 1947 by   
{Mr Cross}and{Mr Sansam.}They make     
 patterns for any{three dimensinal     
{shapes in wood,metal or plastic.      
 They receive designs from customers,  
 then produce a wooden pattern to      
 send to a{foundry}for making{castings.
   The industry is dependant on the    
{skills of the workforce}using a range 
 of{hand tools}together with jigsaws,  
 grinders, sanders etc.{Thirty five    
 people work there. They have forty    
 machines. They work between thirty    
 nine and forty six hours a week. They 
 never work at night. Job satisfaction 
 is very high and men very rarely      
 leave.                                
{  Cross and Sansam's}are one of the   
 few pattern makers of their type  in  
 the country.
