 Oast Houses                           
 These are either one two three four or
 five kilns, the kilns being round or  
 square, very few of them in this area 
 are still used for hop drying, mostly 
 they are used as general stores or    
 converted to living accommodation and 
 sold off from the farm                
 Haymans Hill                          
 This was originally Hangmans Hill but 
 no trace of a gibbett could be found  
 Hop Picking                           
 This was a great annual event with    
 hordes of people coming usually from  
 the East End of London to live in the 
 Hopper Huts which are now seen in many
 places although not used for this     
 purpose                               
 Pickers would usually come in family  
 groups of up to four generations,many 
 babies were born in huts or barns     </content>
