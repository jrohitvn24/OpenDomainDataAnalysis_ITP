		<title>06A TRIP TO THE BLACKSMITH</title>
		<content> The trip to the blacksmith's was very 
 good because it showed you how to make
{horseshoes. }His name was {Mr Laidlaw 
 and he worked in{Avon}at a forge.     
 Mr Laidlaw was a very nice man because
 he showed us how to do it.  The back  
 shoe has two clips because it has     
 pressure in more than one place and   
 the front shoe has only one clip      
 because there is only forward         
 pressure.                             
                                       
 We asked him some questions and one of
 them was "do you make any other things
 like gates and candleholders?"  His   
 answer was that he used to make things
 like that but he does not do it any   
 more because he has not got enough    
 time!
