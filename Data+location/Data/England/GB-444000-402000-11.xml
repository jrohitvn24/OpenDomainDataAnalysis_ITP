		<title>11MINING TRAGEDY IN GOLDTHORPE</title>
		<content> On November 11th 1984 at 1.10 pm. a   
 terrible accident happened in         
 Goldthorpe, South Yorkshire.  Three   
 boys were picking coal on a railway   
 banking.  They had been before with   
 their dad (Mr. Holmes) but they wanted
 to go on their own with their friends.
  Mr. Holmes told them not to dig      
 underneath the banking. When suddenly 
 it fell right on them.  Jimmy Rawson  
 who was passing by heard the cry,     
 "Help! Help!" He rushed over to them  
 and started digging but the rest of   
 the banking fell on Jimmy, breaking   
 both his legs.  Another boy Darren who
 was with them ran for help to Paul's  
 and Darren's house and shouted for    
 their dad, Mr. Holmes. who didn't     
 believe him at first, but he ran out  
 in his slippers.  Digging frantically 
 he tried to get his two sons out.     
 Unfortunately Darren was already dead.</content>
