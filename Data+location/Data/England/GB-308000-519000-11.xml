		<title>11LAMPLUGH FELL FARM</title>
		<content> Cockley Gill has: 117 acres, 1 acre of
 woodland, 37 cows, 26 calves, 17 hens,
 200 Swaledale sheep, 250 lambs and 4  
 tips (rams). The farmer likes looking 
 after the sheep and cows. His tractors
 are used to make hay, silage,         
 spreading muck and fertiliser and     
 feeding the stock there is a David    
 Brown and Massey Ferguson tractor. The
 sheep are clipped in June. When the   
 sheep have been sheared the fleeces   
 are sent to the British Wool Marketing
 Board, Carnforth. The wool is sold to 
 people who spin the wool and make     
 jumpers and rugs. Another important   
 job is to look after the cattle and   
 feed them. The cows aren't milked     
 because it is a fell farm and the     
 calves are sent away for beef. The    
 Lister's have lived on the farm for 8 
 years now. The farm has a lot of grass
 to keep the cattle.                   </content>
