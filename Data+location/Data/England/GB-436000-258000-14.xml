		<title>14RECREATION-HOBBIES&amp;INTERESTS</title>
		<content> In our survey of children and adults  
 in Harbury we discovered that 95% had 
 a hobby or special interest.  The most
 popular hobby is football which       
 attracted 27% of the boys' vote.  When
 asked they said they got a lot of     
 enjoyment from it and many said one   
 day they hoped to play for their      
 favourite football clubs.  Tennis was 
 the most popular sport for girls      
 because of the strong Junior Tennis   
 Club in Harbury.  The hobbies ranged  
 from pebble collecting to bird        
 watching, wind surfing to bee keeping.
  Most people spent between l and 6    
 hours per week on their interest.     
 Some hobbies were expensive           
 particularly when special equipment   
 had to be bought.  Some people had    
 only begun their interest in the      
 last few months - one man had been bee
 keeping for 49 years.                 </content>
