		<title>18Rail &amp; Bus Travel Hollington</title>
		<content> The main railway line from{Hastings to
{Charing X}passes through our area.    
 The journey altogether takes about    
 1hr.45min. There are about 22 trains a
 day each way; leaving every hour and  
 more often at rush hour times for     
 London workers. They all stop at      
{Crowhurst}station. Last year the big  
 Victorian station buildings here were 
 pulled down, and a small ticket office
 put up. They are working on replacing 
 the old diesel trains with an{electric
 system, and hope to be finished in    
 1986. The journey will then be quicker
 and more comfortable. A disused track 
 (once going to Bexhill) can be clearly
 seen at Crowhurst.                    
 A good{bus service}runs to Hollington 
 along Battle Road (at least 7 an hour)
 It costs 45p from Hastings centre. 4  
 services (5 buses an hour) go to Tesco
 There are no buses to Crowhurst.      </content>
