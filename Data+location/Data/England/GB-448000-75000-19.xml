		<title>19Blackgang-A World of Its Own</title>
		<content>                                       
 Blackgang Chine is brilliant. I think 
 that it is the best place on the      
 Island. I like the illuminated        
 Blackgang at night. It is a world of  
 its own. The maze is good- I wish I   
 lived next door to Blackgang Chine.I  
 feel sad that it is crumbling away.The
 Island would never be the same without
 it.                                   
 Over 5000 bushes were used to make    
 the maze. It was first constructed in 
 1963.                                 
 The Dabell family have always         
 owned it. Thousands of tourists every 
 year go to see it. The Cowboy Town is 
 good, everything in it looks real,the 
 Blacksmith,General Stores, Sheriff's  
 Office and Jail.Dinosaur Land is fun  
 with full size dinosaurs. Blackgang   
 Chine is great,I enjoy the maze best.
