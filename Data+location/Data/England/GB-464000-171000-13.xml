		<title>13TRANSPORT(1).CALCOT,READING</title>
		<content>    Transport is very good in the      
 Calcot area.                          
    Locally there are quite regular bus
 services running either directly into 
 the town of Reading,or to Newbury in  
 the other direction,or indirectly to  
 those places via other areas and      
 villages.                             
    Once in Reading there is an        
 excellent train service which will    
 enable one to travel to any part of   
 the country.The train service running 
 through Tilehurst station allows      
 access to the Oxford/Paddington line. 
    From Reading station one may take  
 the special bus to Heathrow airport,  
 from which one may catch a flight to  
 any part of the world.                
    The close proximity of the M4      
 motorway enables residents of Calcot  
 and Tilehurst to travel easily and    
 quickly to the East and West.         </content>
