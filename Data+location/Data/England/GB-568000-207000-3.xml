		<content>   A prominent feature of the area is  
 the great{diversity of schools,}      
 ranging from one built over 90 years  
 ago to others constructed in the past 
 few years.They include neighbourhood {
{primary and comprehensive;}also there 
 are{2 Secondary Selective}and a{R.C.  
{comprehensive}school,large proportions
 of the{intakes}of which live{outside  
{the district.                         
   Equally varied is the{housing, old  
{and new,Council owned and Private,    
 with the newer property on the        
 outskirts of the area gradually eating
 away{farmland}once producing some of  
 the{finest wheat}in the country.Within
 these houses mingled with{East Anglian
{dialects,}can still be heard the tones
 of{Rhondda}and{Tyne,}a reminder of    
 folk who came to the town to seek and 
 indeed to find work in the economic   
 depression prior to World War 2.      </content>
