		<title>18GROVE VILLAGER'S ATTITUDES.</title>
		<content> The chief topic of local village      
 interest centres on the Church.While  
 accepting that a village the size of  
 Grove is too small to support its own 
 vicar,the villagers generally believe 
 that a 'shared vicar',with genuine    
 interest in the village,could over the
 years have maintained regular Services
 and provided leadership for united    
 village events.With the               
 current'quota'still to be raised and  
 general repair and maintainance work  
 overdue,it is regretfully generally   
 accepted that the Church faces        
 closure.Only the one warden in office 
 and te eight or so regular            
 participants in the twice monthly     
 Services appear to work seriosly for  
 the cause.Memories of the older       
 villagers are stimulated by the       
 converted two schools,blacksmith's    
 cottage and kennels.                  </content>
