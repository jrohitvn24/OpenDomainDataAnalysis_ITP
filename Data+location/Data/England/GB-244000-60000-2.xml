		<title>02St. Mary's Church, Tamerton</title>
		<content> The church has almost been destroyed  
 by fire six times.  The last time was 
 in 1981.  It was noticed by a passing 
 motor cyclist.  The roof of the church
 was on fire.  When the firemen arrived
 they let the fire burn.  The vicar    
 asked the firemen why they were not   
 putting out the flames.  He was told  
 that it would make the flames go down 
 into the building and cause more      
 damage.  After several hours the fire 
 was brought under control.  There are 
 a series of carved wooden roof bosses.
  Those in the nave and south aisle are
 thought to be of 15th century origin  
 and a number of them show a face or   
 head with leafy stems growing out of  
 the mouth.  The disastrous fire which 
 destroyed the roof of the nave and    
 much of the roof in 1981 miraculously 
 did not seriously damage the bosses.
