		<title>06Sibton Park Cricket Club</title>
		<content> In 1963 Sibton Park Cricket Club was  
 founded. My Dad (B E Woodhams) used to
 be Vice Chairman of the Cricket Club, 
 but he does not play cricket any more.
 Mark's father D Rawlings still plays  
 though. During the iwnter of 1969 the 
 pitch was flooded and was then used as
 an ice-skating rink until it all      
 melted. There is now a bar in the new 
 pavillion, called the Wet Wicket, and 
 when Mark and I sometimes watch the   
 match we buy a few drinks there. The  
 new pavillion was officially opened by
 the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr      
 Robert Runcie in 1981. The Club has a 
 very nice pitch and coversw at least  
 half a square mile. On one side of the
 pitch they have got a practising      
 stretch for the junior members of the 
 Cricket Club.
