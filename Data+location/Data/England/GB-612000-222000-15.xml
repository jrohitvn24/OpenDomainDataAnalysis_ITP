		<content>   We went into one of the three       
 village shops and talked to a lady who
 had worked there for 6 years.  She    
 gets up at 6.30am but does not have   
 any breakfast.  The shop opens at     
 8.30am and closes at 5.30pm. She      
 prefers the Â£ coin to the Â£ note as it
 is easier for counting in the shop.   
 The lady gave us some prices of items 
 in the shop, eg. bread 46p, butter    
 55p, cheese Â£1.40 per lb., flour 62p  
 and oranges at 13p each.              
   A retired man in the village wakes  
 up at 7.30am.  His hobbies are bowls, 
 gardening and photography.  He has    
 lived in a bungalow for the past 5    
 years, and likes the area. He dis-    
 likes the Â£1 coin but does like the   
 20p coin. For breakfast he eats egg,  
 bacon and toast.
