		<content>    Local people feel that because     
 traffic has increased the area is     
 noisier. There are more outsiders as  
 commuters from Reading and London have
 bought houses, particularly since the 
 building of the M4 motorway.          
   There have also been many changes in
 th countryside. In the last 20 years  
 myxamatosis killed many rabbits and   
 Dutch Elm desease has killed the      
 trees. New trees were planted in 1983.
   The bus service has been taken off  
 because too few people used them. The 
 majority of the residents own private 
 cars. The greater volume of traffic in
 recent years has led to the widening  
 of single lane tracks. One of the     
 complaints of the residents is the    
 shortage of street lights.
