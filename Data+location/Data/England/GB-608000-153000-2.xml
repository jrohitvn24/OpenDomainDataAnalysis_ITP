Tales'.                                
Titled 'Chaucer in Chartham',it        
included a medieval feast in a marquee 
adorned with the coats of arms of      
many guilds and crafts.The feast       
included trenchers of bread and the    
traditional suckling pig.There was     
music played by minstrels,and          
roving players read from the Old       
English version of Chaucer,and the     
Wife of Bath sang a merry tune.
