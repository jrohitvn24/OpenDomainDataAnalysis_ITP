		<content>   During the latter part of the last  
 century a large amount of gravel was  
 excavated to the west of Rickmansworth
 some of which went to help build the  
 London Underground System.The holes   
 left filled up with water from        
 underground springs making two lakes, 
 Batchworth and Bury Lakes.These and   
 the surroundings area of about 100    
 acres are known as the Aquadrome.It   
 forms part of the Colne Valley        
 Regional Park and is located alongside
 the Grand Union Canal. There is a     
 recreation ground with swings,        
 roundabouts and slides for children.  
 There is a free car park and numerous 
 paths for walkers around the lakes.   
 There are facilities for swimming,    
 windsurfing, water ski-ing and an     
 active sailing club.It is popular in

 kept as nature reserves.              </content>
