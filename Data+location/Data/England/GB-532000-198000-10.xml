 Sunday is the only day that my family 
 are together. We wake up at 7.30am and
 have a cooked breakfast. Then we get  
 the paper. At 9.20am we go to St.     
 Michael and All Angels' Church. At    
 10.30am we go to Edmonton Swimming    
 Pool. After we have been swimming we  
 go home and get our dog, Annie, and   
 take her to either Hilly fields or    
 Whitewebbs Parks. When we get home we 
 have lunch. Usually we have either    
 roast lamb or roast pork. Once every  
 two months we have roast beef. After  
 lunch we watch television or use our  
 computer. At 3.00pm we either go to my
 Nan's or she comes to us. At 5.00pm I 
 feed my rabbit, Topsy, then I have    
 something to eat. At 9.00pm I usually 
 go to bed.                            
                                       
                                       </content>
