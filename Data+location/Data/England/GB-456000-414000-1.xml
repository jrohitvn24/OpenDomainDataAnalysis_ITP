		<content> This area includes two small villages 
{Moss}and{Fenwick.}The surrounding land
 is used for{farming,}mainly crops but 
 with some pasture for dairy and beef  
 cattle.{Moss}is the older village but 
{Fenwick}has developed as the land was 
 drained and became farmable. The      
 course of the{River Went}has been     
 altered to avoid the winter flooding  
 of this very flat, low-lying land. One
 of the farms specialises in horse     
 showing and another pig breeding. The 
 only true industry, the local{        
{brickworks}closed in the early 1900s. 
 There is a sewage works for Askern,   
 Moss and Fenwick. Shire horses bred   
 in this area are sold all over the    
 world.
