		<content> The Parent Teacher Association at     
 Belmont Primary School started in     
 1980. A new{committee}is elected each 
 year. If parents have a child at the  
 school they are members of the        
 Association until their child leaves. 
 The P.T.A. raises money to help pay   
 for extra{equipment}to assist in the  
{education}of the children. Of the many
 events it has held the hardest to     
 organise was a seven mile race and fun
 run. This was difficult because it    
 involved  most of the villagers and   
 also the police.                      
 The P.T.A. has supplied many things   
 for the school including climbing     
 ropes,video recorder, spirit          
 duplicator, tee shirts for sports,    
 part of the cost of a holiday for     
 juniors at Whitley Bay,a cupboard for 
 the computer and part of the cost of  
 the{computer}itself.                  </content>
