		<title>03EMPLOYMENT IN GENERAL</title>
		<content>As in many parts of the UK in the '80's
employment is a problem. In a rural    
area this is added to by lack of public
transport, so people without their own 
vehicle have to rely on car sharing or 
to working for companies who provide   
buses to pick up their staff from sur- 
rounding villages. Barningham has a    
daily Eastern Counties Bus Service, if 
unreliable, Market Weston does not.    
Even so work is available if the will  
&amp; intiative is there. There is season- 
al work in farming, fruit &amp; potato     
picking etc. There is a local loyalty  
in giving work to the many small       
businesses &amp; self employed people in   
the villages. For many it is necessary 
to travel to the larger villages such  
as Stanton where there are industrial  
estates or to the towns &amp; cities,      
some commuting as far as London.
