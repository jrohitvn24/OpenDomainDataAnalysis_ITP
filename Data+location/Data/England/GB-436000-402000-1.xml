		<content> WE DID A TOUR OF THE COMPLETE AREA IN 
 OUR SCHOOL BUS. MOST OF THE TIME WE   
 SEEMED TO BE PASSING THROUGH FARMING  
 LAND BOTH ARABLE AND PASTURE. WE      
 DIDN'T SEE ANY SHEEP BUT THERE WERE A 
 FEW HORSES AND COWS IN THE FIELDS. WE 
 ALSO PASSED THROUGH THE DOVECLIFFE AND
 WOMBWELL WOODS WHERE THE NEW SPRING   
 LEAVES AND BLUEBELLS MADE THEM LOOK   
 VERY ATTRACTIVE. THE HOUSING ESTATES  
 WERE MOSTLY COUNCIL HOUSES INCLUDING  
 BUNGALOWS, AND SOME PRIVATE RESIDENCES
 WERE SCATTERED AROUND. THE CENTRE OF  
 WOMBWELL WAS VERY BUSY WITH SHOPPERS  
 AND TRAFFIC. AWAY FROM THE SHOPS      
 EVERYWHERE LOOKED DRAB EXCEPT WHERE   
 SPRING FLOWERS AND BLOSSOMS WERE      
 BLOOMING. WE SAW SWOME SMALL FACTORIES
 IN WOMBWELL BUT ONLY ONE MINE. COAL   
 MINING IS THE MAIN INDUSTRY AND THE   
 RESULTRANT GRIME COULD BE SEEN        
 EVERYWHERE.                           </content>
