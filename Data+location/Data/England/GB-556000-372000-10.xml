		<title>10FARMING OLD AND NEW</title>
		<content>{Mrs Johnson}has lived here all her    
 life.She lived at a farm called       
{Fairfield}very near the seashore.The  
 farm was different years ago.There was
 only grassland and one ploughed field 
 that they grew corn in.The farmer     
{threshed the corn}with a threshing    
 machine and made stacks of straw for  
 the{cows,sheep,and pigs}to eat in     
 winter.The corn was bagged and sold to
 the corn merchant who sold it to a    
 station.The cows were milked twice    
 a day,morning and night by hand.The   
 cream was churned into butter and     
 shaped with scotch hands.They kill the
 pigs by hand and salted them for      
 bacon.They{sheared the sheep by hand  
 and sold the wool.A{horse}pulled a    
 plough.Now a{tractor}is used.Now only 
 cows ,milked by machine,are left.All  
 the grassland is now ploughed for     
{wheat,barley,and}rape.                </content>
