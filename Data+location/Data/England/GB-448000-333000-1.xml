		<title>01THE TRENT AND EREWASH</title>
		<content>  This area borders the Rivers Trent   
 and Erewash and includes the areas of 
 Attenborough, Chilwell, Long Eaton and
 Toton all of which lie almost midway  
 between Nottingham in the East and    
 Derby in the West.                    
  In the north of the area the land    
 rises to 61m and forms low sandstone  
 hills.The main route between          
 Nottingham and Derby runs through this
 area, bisecting the North South routes
 of the M1, Railway and the Erewash    
 Canal.                                
  The central area slopes to the Trent 
 flood plain.Most of this area has been
 developed for housing although the    
 central area is taken up by an        
 Ordnance Depot at Chilwell.           
  The southern area is made up of the  
 Trent floodland. At Trent there is a  
 large railway junction where the      
 rivers Trent and Soar meet.           </content>
