		<title>18THE ARTS</title>
		<content> The arts are well served in           
 Cirencester with many opportunities   
 locally to either participate or      
 spectate.The old brewery in the centre
 of town has been converted into an    
 Arts Centre known as the{Cirencester  
{Workshops.}Nearby is the{Niccol Centre
 which is open all day. It is for old  
 people to do their hobbies and enjoy  
 the day.The age range is 55 and over. 
 More women than men go to classes.The 
 most popular classes, in order, are   
 woodwork,painting,stone carving, clay 
 modelling,drawing and design,         
 calligraphy, cookery and batik.They   
 also have a theatre and exhibitions.  
 There are lots of work shops to do    
 these things in.Some people volunteer 
 to help since they are too young to do
 classes. You can also buy tickets for 
 plays and concerts which are held in  
 the theatre.                          </content>
