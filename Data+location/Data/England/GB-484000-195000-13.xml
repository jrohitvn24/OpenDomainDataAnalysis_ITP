		<content>    At least 90% of all households use 
North Sea gas for heating.Double       
glazing and cavity wall and loft       
insulation are increasingly being used 
to cut down fuel bills.Experimental    
solar panels are still very rare (see  
slide from Naphill).                   
    The homes of the 1980s are full    
of electrical equipment to make        
housework, cooking,gardening and       
do-it-yourself renovations as easy and 
efficient as possible.Almost every     
home  uses a washing machine (with 70% 
also a tumble dryer), a freezer,       
refrigerator and vacuum cleaner.Food   
processors,toasters,sandwich makers,   
coffee makers,electric knives and      
many other gadgets speed up food       
preparation.About 25% of homes in our  
survey use a microwave oven and a dish 
washer.                                
    Power tools are in constant use.   </content>
