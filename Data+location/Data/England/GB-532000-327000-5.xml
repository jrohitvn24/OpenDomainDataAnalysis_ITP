		<title>05Houses around Holbeach Bank</title>
		<content> There is a housing development along  
 Roman Bank filling in all the gaps    
 between the other houses. There are   
 36 new houses and 53 older ones. Some 
 houses are nearly 200 years old. The  
 new houses have been built on         
 wasteland, allotments or places where 
 old buldings were. Many people say    
 that more people will mean more       
 traffic which is a danger to children.
 The houses are crowded round the      
 narrow roads so you cannot see the    
 traffic. It is a problem passing      
 parked lorries. Some people say that  
 the new houses do not fit in with the 
 landscape and others say more shops   
 and wider roads will be needed. The   
 new houses are causing problems.      
 People are coming to live here because
 they have found jobs in the area and  
 because houses are cheaper than in    
 other parts of the country.           </content>
