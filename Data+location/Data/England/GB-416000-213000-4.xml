  Most of the houses in{Sherborne}and{ 
{Windrush}are built of Cotswold stone  
 and many of them have Cotswold        
 stone tiles on the roof.The tiles are 
 small at the ridge and big at the     
 eaves.The Cotswold stone was quarried 
 from now disused quarries near by.    
 Cotswold stone is very rough and cream
 in colour when it first comes out of  
 the quarries.It is sawed and smoothed 
 out to build houses.Some of the houses
 have concrete tiles and others have   
 slates.Many cottages have dormer      
 windows.These are windows that stick  
 out from the roof.The Cotswold stone  
 turns grey when it is older and blends
 into the landscape.
