		<content> One of the popular clubs in the       
 Kevington/St.Mary Cray area for girls 
 of between 7 and 16 is the majorettes.
 The majorettes practice every Thursday
 at Kevington School for 2 hours at a  
 cost of 30p a session. During this    
 time they practice baton twirling and 
 learn moves like "platters","figure of
 eights", "spinners" and "pompoms". The
 majorettes take part in carnivals,    
 parade at village fetes and old       
 peoples homes and take part in        
 competitions as far away as Denmark.  
 The boys of a similar age group       
 usually make up marching bands that   
 accompany the majorettes at their     
 performances.
