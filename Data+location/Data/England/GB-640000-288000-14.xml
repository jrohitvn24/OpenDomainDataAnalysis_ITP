		<title>14 Beccles Church Tower.</title>
		<content> The Tower of St Michaels Parish Church
is built apart from the main church    
because the land is not firm enough to 
hold its weight near Puddingmoor.It was
bought in 1972 with a 1795 penny.      
$68,000 was raised to pay for          
exterior restoration.It is 95 feet high
and if one climbs the spiral stairs one
can see the bell chamber and 10 bells. 
 The tower is 15C. and of interest are 
buried in the churchyard-Rev. Edmund   
Nelson and Catharine Suckling,parents  
of Horatio Lord Nelson.Also buried     
are George Crabbe the poet and Sarah   
Elmy of Beccles.[Mira].                
 From the top fine views of the River  
Waveney,Norfolk marshes and the old    
towns rooftops can be found.There is a 
safety rail around the top now!
