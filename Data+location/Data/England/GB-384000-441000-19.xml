		<title>19INTERVIEW WITH BLACKO FARMER</title>
		<content> We interviewed Mrs.Ison, the farmer at
 Brown House. Every morning she gets up
 at six o'clock and milks the cows, she
 has a farm man to help. She has sixty 
 cows which give 200 gallons of milk at
 their best - she is allowed a quota of
 200,000 litres a year by the          
 government. She has just bought a     
 Limousin Heifer which cost 1,800      
 guineas (1,890 pounds). This is a     
 French breed of cattle and Mrs.Ison   
 wants to try and build up a new herd  
 from this. After milking the cows are 
 left to graze while the farmer cleans 
 up. In the daytime the farmer has many
 jobs like dry-stone walling, diking   
 and fencing. In the summer time the   
 farmers have jobs like cutting grass, 
 collecting it and thistle mowing. In  
 the evening the cows have to be milked
 again. Mrs Ison goes to market at     
 Otley.                                </content>
