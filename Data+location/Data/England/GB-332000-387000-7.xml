		<content> Liverpool first traded with Ireland   
 importing hides etc. and exporting    
 coal. Later trade developed with      
 Africa, America, Australia and other  
 countries. Liverpool traded in        
 tobacco, rum, sugar, flour, fruit and 
 played a large part in the Slave      
 Trade. As ships became bigger         
 Liverpool's first docks were abandoned
 and bigger ones had to be made. When  
 container ships were developed the    
 docks were either too small, too      
 shallow or wrongly equipped and so    
 they fell into disuse, silted up and  
 became derelict. There is an          
 increasing interest in redeveloping   
 the docks and projects undertaken     
 recently have included the Freeport,  
 International Garden Festival, Albert 
 Dock Village, the Maritime Museum and 
 now, planned for the future, the      
 Northern Tate Gallery.                </content>
