		<title>19A PRIMARY SCHOOL, HARROW.</title>
		<content>  The building was originally a boys'  
 boarding school until taken over in   
 1969 by{St.Teresa's, Hatch End.}Now,  
 it is one of the 55 primary schools   
 in Harrow. The ages range from 3 to 12
 years and the subjects include        
 Science, French, Home Economics, Craft
 and Fabrics. The school recently      
 obtained a computer. Soon, the school 
 will move and the site will be used   
 for housing and recreation.           
  There is no 11+ exam in Harrow and   
 the children move onto 1 of the 11    
 high schools. Changes in teaching have
 given each child more attention,      
 responsibility and varied activities  
 in classes of 25 pupils.              
  Mr. Forcer, headmaster of St.        
 Teresa's qualified after taking the   
 Matriculation exam and a 2 year       
 teaching course. Today, a teacher     
 needs 2 A-levels and a degree.        </content>
