		<content> This area of East Anglia is mainly    
 arable.There are a few sheep and some 
 dairy herds of cows.Around Stisted    
 most of the fields are liad to barley,
 wheat and maize.Further to the west   
 oil seed rape is a major crop.Due to  
 the smaller amounts of chemical       
 spraying on rape the poppies have     
 reappeared in this crop. Intensive    
 farming has meant the dissapearance of
 many hegderows in the area.There are  
 also large areas of pasture.The farms 
 are mostly run by tenant farmers and  
 are owned by 2 or 3 firms or          
 individuals.Stubble burning is seen   
 everywhere in late summer.
