		<content> Puzzling to find the roostings that   
 once were Boyatt Wood                 
 Symmetrical footpaths meander across  
 bridges, pass rows of shops,          
 Heading towards the towering,crescent 
 centre piece of the Community.        
 Mothers and Fathers,toddlers and the  
 elderly,together                      
 Join with the schoolchildren,and      
 follow their respective flight paths, 
 Illuminated by a series of white      
 planets,                              
 Guiding the community into this curved
 majestic meeting place.               
 The entrance screen at the end of the 
 crescent                              
 Is approached with a sense of awe and 
 wonder,                               
 Rising up like the great West door of 
 near-by Winchester Cathedral.         
 As you pass through the porthole      
 entrance doors,                       </content>
