		<content> The Itchenor Sailing Club was founded 
 in 1927 by visiting Londoners and to  
 this day the majority of members are  
 from the London area. The Club has    
 about 1200 active members restricted  
 to those sailing the nine different   
 classes of craft.                     
 The Club owns the freehold of the     
 Clubhouse and its grounds and all the 
 members share in is maintenance.      
 There is racing every weekend for the 
 various classes of craft.  There is an
 Annual Regatta and two weeks racing   
 for Junior members during August.
