		<content>   The name Cheesden is believed to    
 have been derived from 'kis' which is 
 pronounced locally as 'chis' and 'den'
 meaning a deep narrow wooded vale of a
 rivulet.'kis' means gravel.           
   The valley is quite remote from the 
 nearest town BURY. The surroundings   
 are quite desolate. The only          
 commercial premises in the area are 2 
 public houses and a mobile shop.      
   The New Inn has quite a good trade  
 but it relies on good weather to      
 attract people from outside the area. 
   The area used to be a thriving      
 community in the early 1900's. The    
 mills and the houses of the mill      
 workers are still there today but they
 are unoccupied and in ruins.
