		<content>We went to Dewhurst wood and saw these 
trees:Holly,Hawthorn,Oak,Ash,Beech and 
Sycamore. There are hundreds of baby   
frogs and we saw a Curlew . The ground 
was covered with moss,roots,bracken,   
peat,dried leaves and a brook. We      
saw these flowers:Bluebells,Foxgloves, 
Blackberries,Rosebay,Willowherb,Speed- 
well,wildrose,Wildrhubarb,Tufted-vetch,
Cowparsley,Goose-grass,Red-campions,   
Thistles,ramsons,Ivy,Nettles and moss. 
There was a very steep bank.We saw a   
skull of a Crow,we saw lots of names   
on a big Oak tree. It was very         
marshy and there was a lot of rubbish  
including an old bed and a lot of tins.
The ground was very boggy. There were  
a lot of ditches,the stile was broken  
so we had to slide under.
