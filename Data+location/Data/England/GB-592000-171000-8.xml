		<content>  The area is well served by a variety 
 of sports and social clubs,although a 
 good deal of activity takes place in  
 the nearby Sheerness Leisure Centre.  
  There are, however, facilities for   
 soccer,rugby,cricket,horse riding and 
 an area used for hand gliding on      
 occasions.Probably the most widely    
 used facility is the links 9 hole golf
 course which is situated close behind 
 the marshy area which is found close  
 to the seafront.                      
  Probably one of the most widely used 
 areas is that along the newly built   
 seafront wall and the clifftop path   
 above,which both give access to the   
 beach below.Walkers of all ages make  
 the fullest use of this area and,were 
 the actual beach itself to be cleared 
 up,the whole area would become very   
 pleasant indeed.
