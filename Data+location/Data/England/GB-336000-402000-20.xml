		<content> Maghull and Lydiate exist as two      
 separate communities joined by two    
 main communication routes,the A59 road
 wich physically splits the communities
 in half and the Leeds_Liverpool canal 
 which played a large part in the      
 earlier development of the            
 communities.Both are thriving areas   
 and Maghull with its modern Town      
 Square and newly opened Town Hall has 
 a particular sense of identity.       
 Modern housing estates combine with   
 inter war houses and cottages and farm
 buildings some of which date back to  
 the 16th century.Shops and other      
 facilities are plentiful,there        
 thriving youth clubs and a well       
 appointed library and health          
 centre.The young complain there is not
 enough to do and vandalism is not     
 unknown but,compared to many parts of 
 Merseyside,it is a pleasant area.     </content>
