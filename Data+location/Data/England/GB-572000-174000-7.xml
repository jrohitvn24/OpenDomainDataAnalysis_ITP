    Every school day I get up at 8     
o'clock in the morning and get washed  
and dressed for school.For my breakfast
I have coffee and a biscuit.When it is 
8.52 I go to school,which starts at    
9.00.When I get to school I feed the   
animals and we have morning lessons    
like maths and reading. At 12 o'clock  
we have our lunch,I have packed lunch. 
Sometimes we have P.E. in the afternoon
or we do project work.We are doing a   
project on the Domesday Book and we    
have drawn a plan of our classroom and 
a picture of the front of our house.   
Some of us have planted seeds to grow  
and we are doing a book on frogs and   
chicks too.At the moment we have got   
some eggs in the incubator.When we go  
home at 3.10 I have my dinner then I   
read or watch television before I go to
bed at 7.00.                           </content>
