		<content> the land in and around Marsh Green is 
 being bought up and built on so       
 gradually the village is growing. The 
 old thatched cottages are being       
 replaced with new tiled houses. Marsh 
 Green is now made up of several       
 thatched cottages, a row of council   
 houses and a lot more newer houses. It
 has a bus stop, a telephone box and a 
 post box. Apart from this there is    
 really not a lot. There are 2 bus     
 routes through Marsh Green one to     
 Exeter and one the other way through  
 West Hill to Ottery St Mary and       
 Honiton.
