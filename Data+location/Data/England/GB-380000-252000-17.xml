		<content> The school opened in Pitmaston House  
 (built in 1830s) Malvern Road, in 1948
 to accommodate 23 children overspill  
 from St John's school.                
 The present number on role is 503,    
 with 17 staff, occupying school       
 buildings constructed in 1955 &amp; 1971  
 behind Pitmaston House(now the        
 Teacher's Centre)                     
 Ironically, 43 children came from St  
 John's school in September 1984,      
 following it's closure.               
{St.Clement's School}is an old         
 foundation, having been opened in 1816
 by the church from which it takes its 
 name. Originally there were three     
 departments, Infants, Junior boys and 
 Junior Girls, but over the years they 
 have been merged into a Primary School
 serving children from 3 to 11. It is  
 now an aided school with 286 children 
 and 10 staff.                         </content>
