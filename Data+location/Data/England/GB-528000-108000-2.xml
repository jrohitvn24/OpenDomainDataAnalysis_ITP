		<content> My favourite dinner is sausage beans  
 and chips and for pudding I like      
 butterscotch tart best.In afternoon   
 school we watch junior maths.Then we  
 play rounders.After play we have a    
 story read to us. At present it is    
 Stig of the Dump by Clive King.       
 At 3.15p.m. we put up our chair an    
 sing good afternoon.                  
  After school I play . I ride my      
 B.M.X. bike and also play in my       
 paddling pool. I have hamburder and   
 chips or a salad for tea. Then i do my
 recorder practice and after this watch
 television. My favourite programmes   
 are Dog Tanyon, Doctor Who , and the  
 Kenny Everett show. I read a book in  
 bed and go to sleep at 8.30p.m.
