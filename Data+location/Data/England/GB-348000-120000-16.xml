		<content>  Mr. Foot started teaching in         
 1955,about 30 years ago.He has been in
 Westfield Comprehensive School.       
 Before,it was a girl's High School and
 Mr. Foot taught there for 2 years.    
 He teaches mathematics and religious  
 education.The harder for him to teach 
 is marginally R.E.The curriculum has  
 changed,for example;R.E. has a much   
 broader base,now dealing with other   
 things besides the Bible.Maths is both
 traditional and modern.               
 He lives 17 miles from the school and 
 travels there by car.He arrives at    
 8:20 a.m,15 minutes earlier than he   
 has to.He holds a Christian Union at  
 lunchtime (1:30 p.m),and a hedge      
 cutting session in Summer.
