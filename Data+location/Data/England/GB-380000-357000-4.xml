		<content> Rode heath is in the parish of Odd    
 Rode.Odd Rode used to be part of      
 Macclesfield Forest.In old English    
 Rode or "Rod"meant a clearing.Odd     
 derives from the name of a person     
 thought to be a man named Hod hence   
 Hod's Rod became Odd Rode.            
 Scholar Green derives its name from   
 the way in which farms were written   
 in the time of Edward 1.(Scolehalc or 
 Scolal)These terms are Scandinavian in
 origin which can be explained by the  
 Wirral and surrounding areas being    
 places of fairly intense viking       
 settlement.The Green part is self     
 explanatory.                          
 Rode Heath had been important for the 
 production of salt for over two       
 hundred years.The opening of the Trent
 and Mersey canal led to an expansion  
 of the community.This industry has    
 ceased and so have the salt workings. </content>
