		<title>17FARMING</title>
		<content> The area studied was made up of a vast
 area of farmland with some woodland   
 and little housing. Some of the farms 
 studied show this area to be important
 for arable farms growing large fields 
 of wheat and barley with other crops  
 like oil-seed rape, potatoes, peas and
 sugar-beet. The farms studied included
 Lamb Farm, Elm Farm, Park Farm, Earls 
 Hall, and Frowick Hall. All were      
 arable farms some of which had little 
 livestock. The Turkey Farm was the    
 only real place which you could say   
 was important for animals. The farms  
 were all quite big with large fieds   
 and had areas of woodland and copse   
 breaking up the landscape which was   
 either flat or gently roling. When we 
 studied the farms we saw lots of      
 machinery in the sheds. Some of the   
 barns and sheds were new but many old 
 buildings remained.                   </content>
