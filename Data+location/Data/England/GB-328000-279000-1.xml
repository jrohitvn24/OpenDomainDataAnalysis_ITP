		<title>01General View of Clun Area</title>
		<content> The block has the village of Clun at  
 its centre and apart from this        
 settlement it is a purely agricultural
 area. The area inside the block has a 
 population of about 1000. It is an    
 ancient settlement dating back to     
 Saxon times and the signs of its long 
 history are all around. The street    
 layout is a Norman grid plan. The     
 surrounding area is outstandingly     
 beautiful, consisting of undulating   
 hills, made up of patchwork fields and
 mixed woodland. The area is dominated 
 by agriculture. Farms vary in size    
 from under 100 to over 1000 acres and 
 are all of the mixed type combining   
 livestock(mainly cattle &amp; sheep) and  
 arable(cereals). The reletively       
 isolated position of the area has     
 enabled it to maintain its traditional
 character without a disproportionate  
 number of commuters or holiday homes. </content>
