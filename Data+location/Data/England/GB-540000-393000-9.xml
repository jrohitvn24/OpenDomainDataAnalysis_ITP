		<content> .GOING TO THE YMCA by PETER JACKLIN.  
 WHEN I WENT TO THE YMCA IN GRIMSBY.I  
 WENT TO HAVE A LOOK.I ASKED THE PERSON
 IN CHARGE OF THE BMX TRACK HOW MUCH IT
 WAS TO TAKE A BMX ON THE TRACK.HE SAID
 Â£1.50.THE NEXT DAY I BROUGHT MY BMX.  
 AND HE GAVE A TICKET TO BE IN A RACE. 
 I GAVE HIM MY Â£1.50.THAT NIGHT AT 5.30
 I WENT TO MY FRIENDS HOUSE IN GRIMSBY.
 WHEN IT WAS 5.45 I WENT ON MY BIKE TO 
 THE YMCA.WHEN I GOT THERE THE MAN SAID
 TAKE YOUR BIKE UP THE HILL AND PUT IT 
 IN LINE WITH THE OTHER BIKES.THE RED  
 FLAG WENT DOWN.THEN THE RAMP WENT DOWN
 WE WENT DOWN THE HILL AND DID THE     
 TABLE TOP AND ONE BOY FELL OFF.THEN   
 ANOTHER BOY WENT OVER HIS HANDLE BARS.
 THEN WE WENT OVER THE LAST JUMP.THEN  
 IT WAS THE FINISH LINE.I CAME         
 THIRD.THEN I GOT A DRINK.THEN WE WENT 
 HOME AND HAD MY TEA.
