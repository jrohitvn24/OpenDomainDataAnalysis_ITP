		<title>15A FARMERS DAY cont</title>
		<content> tanking ,rolling and harrowing and    
 re-seeding.At very busy times of the  
 year,like silaging time,the farmer has
 to work from very early in the morning
 to late at night,cutting the grass and
 bringing it in to the silo to be      
 stored for winter feed for the cows.  
  At 4 pm it is time to milk the cows  
 for the 2nd time.Ben,the sheep dog,   
 runs off eagerly to round the cows    
 up.While the cows are being milked    
 ,the farm worker moves the electric   
 fence to give fresh grass for the     
 night .Afternoon milking is usally    
 finished by 5:30pm but after the      
 evening meal there are still jobs to  
 be done such as looking at in - calf  
 cows ,looking at the fields to decide 
 which field the cows are going in     
 next.It can sometimes be a long and   
 tiring day  but most farmers enjoy it.
