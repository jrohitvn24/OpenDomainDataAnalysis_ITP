		<content>  Dairy farming is now the main source 
 of income.There are approximately 700 
 acres of grass,silage and hay,150     
 acres of corn, 50 acres of fodder beet
 with 40 acres of turnip providing     
 winter fodder for the herds.There are 
 three large dairy units at Henshears, 
 Bickham and Gilles. The change from   
 beef to dairy cattle was as a direct  
 result of government financial        
 incentives but as government has      
 introduced milk quotas which are      
 expected to be reduced beef is being  
 reintroduced. Wheat and barley are    
 also grown wheat as a cash crop and   
 barley for use on the farms the       
 resulting straw is also used on the   
 farms. In October any remaining grass 
 is let for sheep grazing.
