		<content> Horse-Eye Level partly comes under the
 Rape of Pevensey, separates the town  
 of Hailsham from Pevensey Marshes     
 proper and skirts the village of      
 Herstmonceux. It is predominantly     
 farmland with enclosed rough grazing  
 but where advance has taken place on  
 the marsh some crops are now grown. A 
 feature of the area is fields         
 separated by dykes. In 1977 it was    
 scheduled a site of special Scientific
 Interest for Flora and fauna, and     
 notified under Section 23 of the      
 National Parks and Access to          
 Countryside Act 1949. Public Transport
 is sparse and apart from a small part 
 of a Council Estate and a residential 
 Caravan Park, housing is cottages and 
 farm houses. Being so close to        
 Hailsham and Eastbourne the area is   
 used for recreational activities by   
 people from outside the area.         </content>
