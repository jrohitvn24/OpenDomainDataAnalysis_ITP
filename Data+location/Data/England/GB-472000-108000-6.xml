		<content> This is a{dairy farm}of 40 acres,     
 there are 30 cows and replacements are
 reared on the farm, at present 11     
 calves.  5 acres are used for growing 
 kale and the remainder is grassland.  
 The grass leys are reseeded every four
 or five years.                        
 The farmer has one tractor which he   
 uses for general work round the farm, 
 he uses contractors for cutting silage
 and other larger tasks.               
 Buildings include a milking parlour,  
 covered yard, and barns for the       
 storage of straw etc. The cattle stay 
 in the covered yard during the winter 
 and are fed on silage and kale. The   
 farmer owns the land and is the third 
 generation of his family to live on   
 the farm. He feels the climate is     
 particularly good and the soil is a   
 clayey loam.
