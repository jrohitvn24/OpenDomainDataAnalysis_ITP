		<title>16Scotter County School</title>
		<content> The school (built by{Lindsey C.C.})   
 was opened in{1932}as an all age      
 school.It had 150 pupils and 8 staff. 
 In 1958 it became a Primary school    
 with 175 pupils.At present there are{ 
{300}pupils on roll with 10 teachers   
 (including the headmaster).There has  
 been a drop of{about 100}pupils in the
 last 5 years,with a reduction of 4    
 staff.At the age of 11, pupils can    
 transfer to{Huntcliff Comprehensive   
{School,Kirton Lindsey}or take the     
 County Examination of Selection to the
 High School in Gainsborough.Delay in  
 implementing a Comprehensive system in
 Gainsborough has caused much confusion
 and difficulty at Scotter.            
   The school is also used by outside  
 organisations in the evening.These are
 Parent/ Teacher Association,Brownies, 
 Girl Guides and also as an Adult      
 Education Centre.                     </content>
