 is a residential area,with large      
 expensive houses.It is surrounded by  
 picturesque scenery but does not have 
 many public services such as telephone
 boxes and a local bus service.Most of 
 the residents have two or more cars.  
  There is extensive building work     
 going on,mostly of houses.Despite it  
 being a residntial area,there is not a
 lot for young people to do;there is   
 one park,one{cricket ground and one   
{public house}.As well as these        
 amenities there is a garage and a     
 special school.The area is a          
 commuter region with the businessmen  
 driving to Beaconsfield to{travel}to  
 London by train.Demand for houses is  
 high so therefore houses are          
 expensive.The main shopping centre is 
 Beaconsfield with the new 'Waitrose'  
 superstore.                           </content>
