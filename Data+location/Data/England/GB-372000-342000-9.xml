		<content>{Woore Cricket Club,}which plays in the
 South Cheshire League, has been a part
 of village life for many years.       
 It has reached the quarter-final of   
 the{Haig National Competition,}but has
 not done as well in Knock-out cricket 
 recently as it did some years ago.    
 Attempts are being made to re-start   
 a{village football team,}which, in    
 pre-war years, played on the field now
 occupied by the school.               
{The badminton club}runs two teams in  
 local leagues, and plays in the       
 Victory Hall.                         
 A group from the village cleared the  
 tennis court behind the Manor House,  
 and that is back in use as a{tennis   
{club.                                 
{The bowls club}has a new green, thanks
 to the Swan Hotel and plays in local  
 league.                               
 There has been great revitalisation!  </content>
