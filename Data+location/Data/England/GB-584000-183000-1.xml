		<title>01The Beecroft Art Gallery</title>
		<content> The Gallery is situated in Station    
 Road, Westcliff-on-Sea, opposite the  
 Cliffs Pavilion.It is 85 years        
 old.Originally it was two houses with 
 seven floors.Then it became The       
 Warwick Hotel.Mr. Walter Beecroft     
 bought it and turned it into an Art   
 Gallery.It is now a Charitable Trust  
 administered by Southend Council.There
 are 2090 paintings.It is not open     
 every weekend as there is only one    
 full-time member of staff to run it;  
 but there are almost 60 volunteers    
 helping, mainly elderly folk living   
 nearby who love Art.There is only one 
 part-time cleaner.It's most famous    
 painting is-"On the Stour" by John    
 Constable which is normally kept in a 
 safe.There are lots of pictures of Old
 Southend, and many postcards and books
 on sale.
