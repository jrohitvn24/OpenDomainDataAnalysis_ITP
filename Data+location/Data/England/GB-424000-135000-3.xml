		<title>03Oil Pipeline Project</title>
		<content> Five months work for a Â£4O million    
 project to lay a pipeline underground 
 from Fawley S.Hants to Seison near    
 Wolverhampton. Esso had to negotiate  
 with 420 landowners in this scheme.   
 In this area 6 farmers have been      
 affected. The pipeline 14"(35cms) in  
 diameter carries white oil products,  
 petrol, paraffin, jet fuel, and diesel
 Batches of these are pumped           
 consecutively without break of flow.  
 It is estimated that 500 million      
 gallons annually will be pumped       
 through.  Construction working width  
 60feet wide: soil replaced in right   
 sequence, ie;subsoil, topsoil.        
 Temporary wooden fencing erected until
 new hedges have grown up to replace   
 those removed. Restrictions on        
 building works and tree growth within 
 10 feet of buried pipeline remain in  
 force for ever.                       </content>
