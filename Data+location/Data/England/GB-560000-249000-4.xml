		<content>     The two main villages in this area
 are West Wratting with a population of
 450 and West Wickham with a population
 of 380. Most of the people live in the
 villages or in houses attached to the 
 main farms.                           
     There is a mix of elderly, new-   
 comers and a few people who have      
 always lived in the villages. The     
 area contains a mixture of social     
 classes.                              
     School children from the whole    
 area attend Balsham Primary School or 
 Linton Village College. These are both
 out of the area and the children      
 travel by school bus.                 
     The oldest inhabitant of West     
 Wratting is a man aged 96 years.      
     The only "holiday homes" are a few
 near Weston Green owned by the more   
 elite.
