		<content> It is a little village in North       
 Norfolk.It's a very old village with a
 tremedous amount of history.Many years
 ago there used to be a priory.It has  
 fallen into ruins and is now called   
 the Abbey.Mr.and Mrs.Gurney live      
 there.The Gurneys own the majority of 
 both villages.Also there is a         
 friary.The Wileys live there.They are 
 not nearly as important as the        
 Gurneys.I enjoy living in             
 Walsingham.There are a great many     
 half_timbered houses.These were built 
 in the 1400's.Walsingham is famous for
 it's pilgrims.Thousands come at the   
 same time.There is a peaceful river   
 that runs through both villages.The   
 railway came in 1850.It is now closed 
 and its place taken by a narrow gauge 
 private railway.
