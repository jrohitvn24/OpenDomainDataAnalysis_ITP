		<title>13SHEEPSCOMBE SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Our school is very small.There are 9  
 in the infant class and 16 in the     
 junior class. We have a lot of help   
 from our teachers because we are so   
 few and also it is usually very quiet.
 We have many chances to play football,
 cricket and rounders but often there  
 are not enough children to make a good
 team. When we acted a masque this term
 everyone had more than one role to    
 play. We worry that if the school gets
 too small it will close. Joe likes    
 doing English because it makes him    
 think, and handwork because he can    
 make good things. Iain likesmaths,    
 English, science, drama and handwork. 
 He says the best thing about school is
 tht you learn what you have to do in  
 life, like when you have to make a    
 hard decision you will know what to   
 do.Everybody likes going swimming on  
 Mondays at Gloucester.                </content>
