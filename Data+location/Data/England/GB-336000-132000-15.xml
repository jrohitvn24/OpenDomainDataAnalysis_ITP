		<title>15George Inn, Middlezoy</title>
		<content> The George Inn, Middlezoy is a 17th   
 Century coaching inn. It is owned by  
 the licencees Mr and Mrs D Stewart.   
 Many of the village's social and      
 recreational activities take place    
 there. Skittles and darts are popular 
 games and there are local teams for   
 both. The pub also has bar billiards  
 and American Pool tables. As the pub  
 is a free house the landlord is able  
 to offer a selection of beers and     
 other drinks from a variety of local  
 breweries.                            
 The George Inn has a reputation for   
 providing good food which is all home 
 cooked by Mrs Stewart. They are also  
 able to offer bed and breakfast. Local
 groups such as the W.I. and the P.T.A.
 occasionally hold functions at the    
 George, because it is such a popular  
 venue.
