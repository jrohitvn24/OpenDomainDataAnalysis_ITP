		<content>{Language;local dialect:}the village   
 dialect could be described as one     
 reflecting the Merseyside district as 
 a whole. It has lost much of its      
 distinctive South Lancashire accent.

 Because my eyes aren't as good as     
 before.She towd me,"get thee sen tert 
 docter."She told me,"take yourself to 
 the doctor."This example is readily   
 understood by the older Contonian,less
 well by the young.{City Influence;}   
 the strongest influence on the way    
 language is spoken and sometimes      
 written in the village, is the        
 Liverpool accent.{Common useage;}ar or
