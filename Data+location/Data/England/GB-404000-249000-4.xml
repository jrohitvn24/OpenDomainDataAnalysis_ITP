		<content> Our school isn't very big.We have four
 classrooms but one is used as a       
 library.We have a hall where we do    
 games and eat our dinner.             
   The infant class has children who   
 are aged from four to six year olds.  
   The next class is the middle        
 class with children who are aged from 
 six to eight year olds.               
   In the top class the children are   
 from the age of eight to eleven.In    
 the whole school there are 85         
 children.                             
   The winter uniform is a grey skirt  
 or trousers,a white or grey shirt and 
 a maroon and silver tie.The summer    
 uniform is a pink and white checked   
 dress for the girls,but the boys wear 
 their winter uniform.                 
   We learn English, mathematics,      
 history, geography, science and games 
 at our school.                        </content>
