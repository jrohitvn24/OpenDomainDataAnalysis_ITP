		<title>08Birmingham-Worcester canal</title>
		<content> The Birmingham-Worcrster{canal}was    
 begun in l79l and finished in l8l5 as 
 the company kept running out of money.
 It was a very important means of      
{transport}for the local community.    
 Nowadays it is not used for the       
 transport of industrial goods but is  
 used by people who use barges as a    
{leisure activity.} Alvechurch Marina  
 is where a lot of the barges are      
 moored.   Part of the canal has had to
 be re-routed because of the M42       
{Motorway}being built across this area.
 The canal is also good for fishing and
 many{anglers}catch perch, roach and   
 carp in  it.   The fishing permit is  
 granted by the Birmingham Angling     
 Association.
