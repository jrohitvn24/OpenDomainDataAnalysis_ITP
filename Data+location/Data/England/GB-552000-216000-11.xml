		<title>11Hatfield Broad Oak Families</title>
		<content>{Information compiled from an informal 
{survey of 25 families with children at
{school on 9 July, 1985.   }           
   The size of families ranges from 2  
 to 7 persons living in the same house.
 Out of 56 adults 48 go to work, 17 in 
 the village and the rest in other     
 places to which most of them travel by
 car. The bus and train services (the  
 latter from Bishop's Stortford) are   
 used only occasionally and not on a   
 daily basis.                          
   With the exception of a few children
 who are at private boarding schools   
 the older children in the village go  
 to eight or nine different secondary  
 schools in Bishop's Stortford, Harlow,
 Newport and Stansted Mountfitchet,    
 travelling by school coach or car.    
   In the 25 families of our sample    
 there are 43 cars, 4 motor cycles and 
 68 pedal cycles.                      </content>
