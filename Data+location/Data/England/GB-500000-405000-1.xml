		<content>       Our area lies immediately to the
 east of the River Ancholme and twenty 
 eight kilometres south of the River   
 Humber.   The county boundary between 
 South Humberside and Lincolnshire     
 crosses the area from east to west.   
 The land is low lying and is drained  
 by a network of ditches taking water  
 towards the River Ancholme.  {Arable  
{farming} is the main activity with    
 barley, wheat, sugar beet and rape    
 being the main crops.                 
                                       
      To the north west of the block   
 lies part of the {market town}of Brigg
 which  grew up at a point where it was
 possible to cross the Ancholme Valley 
 before successful {drainage }of the   
 land.  Brigg serves the surrounding   
 rural area and has a cattle market on 
 Tuesday and street markets on         
 Thursdays and Saturdays.              </content>
