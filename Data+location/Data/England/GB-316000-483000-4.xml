		<title>04THWAITES VILLAGE POLICEMAN</title>
		<content> Opposite our school there is a police 
 station. We went to interview the     
 policeman and asked  him some         
 questions about his job. On a typical 
 day he visits his section office      
 (Millom Police Station) to write      
 reports, answer telephone enquiries   
 and tell his supervisor what he has   
 been doing and to get instructions. He
 then goes on foot patrol. He has to   
 deal with community policing, road    
 traffic offences, and traffic         
 accidents. He also has to check on    
 property and tell people about gun    
 regulations. He travels about sixty   
 miles in a day. Every year he trains  
 some children from Thwaites School for
 their Cycling Proficiency test. The   
 policeman gets to know all the        
 children at school and they all know  
 him.
