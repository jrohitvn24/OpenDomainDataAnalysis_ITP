		<content>  In our area there are two villages,  
{Bayford and Little Berkhamsted.}Both  
 are relatively small. The nearest     
 large towns for shopping and employ-  
 ment are Hertford, Hatfield, Welwyn   
 Garden City.                          
  There are very{few amenities.}There  
 are three bus services, but only one  
 runs daily.There is also Bayford Rail-
 way Station, on a main line into      
 London. Private transport is          
 essential.                            
  This is primarily a{farming area,    
 with eight farms. There is also much  
{woodland,}the amount is usual for such
 a low-lying area in the South-East.   
 There are ten woods.                  
  There are also some good{footpaths}in
 this hilly area.                      
  Of particular interest to{visitors   
 are 2 Parish Churches and the Folly.
