          We visited Holy Well where we
 asked the Headmistress if we could ask
 her some questions about the school.  
 The school was built in 1830, there   
 are two classrooms and there are two  
 permanent teachers and one part timer.
 There are thirty four children and the
 children get to school by: taxi, cars,
 and bicyles. The school catchment area
 includes Lake, Eastacombe and         
 Harracott.There is no connection with 
 the school and the{Holy Well}just     
 outside the school grounds.The only   
 connection with Tawstock Parish       
 Council is one governor and the       
 Council own the war memorial garden on
 the boundary of the school.
