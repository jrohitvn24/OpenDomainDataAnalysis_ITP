In such a rural community a pre-school 
playgroup is very well supported, there
being 24 children on the books at the  
end of the Summer Term 1985.As well as 
enabling the children to mix, it is    
also a place for Mums to meet each week
and have a cup of coffee and a chat.   
  There are many different activities  
for the children,sit and ride          
toys,slide,trampoline and many table   
games,also many artistic               
outlets,painting(which can be very     
messy),plastercine,collage and drawing.
The Mums pay 60p per child each morning
and the children enjoy milk and        
biscuits before going home.            
The playgroup is affiliated to         
Shrewsbury Playgroup Association
