 Reserve is owned by the RSPCA and is  
 in Peter James Lane, Fairlight, East  
 Sussex.                               
                                       
 The oldest tree in the Reserve is a   
 cherry and is about 250 years old.    
 Most of the trees are about 50 years  
 old.   Silver birch, sweet chestnut,  
 oak and hazel are the most common     
 trees here.   The most important tree 
 is the oak as it attracts up to 300   
 different species of insects.   The   
 most common plants are bracken and    
 bluebells.   The smallest animal found
 here is the shrew, and the smallest   
 bird is the goldcrest.                
                                       
 The Reserve has a hospital unit where 
 about 350 injured animals and birds   
 are cared for and released each year.
