		<title>10Flora/Fauna in Rathmell NW</title>
		<content>    There are numerous varieties of    
 flowers, trees, animals and birds.    
    Most of the{flowers}are common     
 ones, but there are scores of         
 varieties in the hedgerows to the east
 and on the{heathland}to the west.     
 There are several wooded areas, some  
 quite dense.{Deciduous trees          
 predominate but there are{coniferous  
{woods}too. These trees grow in the    
 valleys of the becks and are most     
 numerous in the eastern part of the   
 block. The trees in the western part  
 are more isolated and grow mainly by  
 farmhouses to give them some          
 protection.                           
    The{birds}vary from crows,         
 starlings and blackbirds to pheasant  
 and partridge. There are also many    
{wild animals}including badgers, hares,
 foxes and rabbits.
