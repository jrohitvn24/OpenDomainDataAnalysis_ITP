		<title>16Playtime Games at School</title>
		<content> The games I enjoy the most are British
 Bulldog, Dub Dub and chain-tag.       
                                       
  The most popular game is British     
 Bulldog, the rules are, you have a    
 long stretch of playground and one    
 person is 'on' and he or she then     
 stands in the playground with the     
 others at one end. The person calls   
 out someone's name and they have to   
 run from one end of the playground to 
 the other without being 'tagged'. If  
 you don't make it, you join the person
 in the middle and the winner is the   
 last person to be caught.             
                                       
  Other games played include Skipping, 
 conkers (in the Autumn), throwing and 
 catching a tennis ball, ball-tag,     
 football and off-ground tag.
