		<title>19Watford: The Railways</title>
		<content> Watford is a major station on the     
 old London-Midland-Scotland Railway.  
 In 1984 Watford Junction Station      
 redevelopment was started beside the  
 present station buildings.These       
 buildings were in their day a         
 modernisation of the old Watford      
 Junction Station, part of which can   
 still be seen on the NW side of the   
 St. Albans Road bridge.               
 Two branch lines make a rail link     
 with Croxley Green and St. Albans.    
 The main line provides an inter-city  
 service between London(Euston) and    
 Glasgow. The shortest journey time    
 between London and Glasgow is 5 hours 
 14 minutes. Watford also has a London 
 Underground station.It is on the      
 Metropolitan Line which runs as far   
 as Aldgate in the East End of London.
