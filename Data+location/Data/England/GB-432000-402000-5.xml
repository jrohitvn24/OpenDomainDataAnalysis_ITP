		<title>05A WORSBROUGH LANDMARK</title>
		<content>{Black Rock}has been part of Worsbrough
 for hundreds of years, or so it is    
 said.  It is a landmark in the Ward   
 Green/Worsbrough Common area, a huge  
 black rock with a flat top.  There are
 many tales about it.  Some think it   
 was blown there.  Some believe it was 
 a hospital as there are arches in it. 
 It is a place where young people in   
 the area go.  They do everything      
 there. They paint slogans and pictures
 on it.  On top there is a skull and   
 crossbones.  At one side they have    
 made a scene of a waterfall.  They    
 fight over it and one group takes     
 possession of it.  Ward Greeners fight
 the Worsbrough Commoners and kids from
 Worsbrough Bridge help the Ward       
 Greeners, but, after the fight,       
 everyone goes there just the same, no 
 matter who wins.
