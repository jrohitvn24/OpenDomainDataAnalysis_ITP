		<title>03 CAMPING-THE SHAWS &amp; GUIDING</title>
		<content> {"The Shaws"} is sited in the village 
of Cudham and is used by the London and
South-East England Region of the {Girl 
Guides Association}. Its 98 acres of   
fields and woodland contain 19 camping 
plots and 3 Pack Holiday Houses for use
by Brownies.  There are 2 main camping 
areas. The upper site contains the camp
shop, Warden's house and Brownie huts. 
This is separated from the lower site  
by a strip of woodland, at the south   
end of which is the Camp Fire Circle.  
 The site is habitat for much wildlife,
other than Guides and Brownies! The    
girls camping there have been known to 
have their foodstores stolen by badgers
in the night. Foxes and Grass Snakes   
are also residents.                    
 1985 marked the {75th anniversary of  
the Guiding Movement} and on July 6th, 
6,000 Guides and Brownies converged on 
Cudham to celebrate the anniversary.   </content>
