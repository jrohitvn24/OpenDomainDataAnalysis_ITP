 ound the river.Victorian Era came and 
 the present bridge was built.The      
 previous bridge was destroyed by      
 floods and rebuilt in 1675.The Grammar
 school was built in 1611 in Manor     
 Sqaure but is now in Farnley Lane.    
 The Poor House was moved from Cross   
 Green in 1873 and an Imfirmary added  
 in 1907.   By Benjamin Rhodes.        
 New estates have been built like      
 Riverside in the mid-1970's.The       
 Whartons Middle School was built in   
 1975.The market is known to have been 
 attended and maintained for 700 years.

 re-established.
