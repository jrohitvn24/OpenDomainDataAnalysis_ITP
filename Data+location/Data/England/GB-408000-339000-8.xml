		<content>   Riverside is a very large house l29 
years old. It used to belong to the    
Heywood family and stands in l40 acres 
of land but 65\70 acres are rented out 
to local farmers. The house is the     
school where the children work and live
and in the grounds are houses for the  
headmaster and staff. There are sports 
grounds,swimming pool and gardens.There
are l6 acres of woodland, 2 woods      
containing coniferous and deciduous    
trees. One is called Badger Wood       
because  they can be seen playing at   
night with their cubs. A fox and his   
vixen bring out their cubs to play on  
the school lawn. A public footpath runs
through the wood so we can see the wide
variety of birds and small animals     
which have their home in the wood.     
    The front porch and an archway are 
very old and are listed buildings and  
cannot be destroyed.                   </content>
