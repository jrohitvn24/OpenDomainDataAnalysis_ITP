 WE INTERVIEWED A FARM WORKER IN       
 WOOTTON ST. LAWRENCE.HE HAS WORKED ON 
 THE FARM FOR THIRTY THREE YEARS, AND  
 THE FARM IS AN ARABLE FARM.THERE ARE  
 FIVE THOUSAND ACRES OF LAND BUT THEY  
 ONLY FARM TWO THOUSAND ACRES OF       
 LAND.TO WORK ON A FARM YOU NEED TO GO 
 TO AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE.IF YOU HAVE   
 BEEN BROUGHT UP ON A FARM YOU DONT    
 NEED TO GO TO AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE    
 BECAUSE YOU WOULD HAVE MORE           
 EXPERIENCE.THE ONLY CHANGES THE FARM  
 WORKER WOULD LIKE IS TO STOP CROP     
 SPAYING BECAUSE IT IS BECOMING A      
 HEALTH HAZARD.ALTHOUGH THE FARM IS AN 
 ARABLE FARM THEY STILL BREED BEEF     
 CATTLE.THE FARM WORKER IS QUITE HAPPY 
 WITH THE MONEY HE EARNS AND IS ALSO   
 VERY HAPPY WITH HIS JOB.
