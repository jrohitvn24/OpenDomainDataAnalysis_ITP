 Charnwood was founded in 1975 with 12 
 members. It expanded as the years went
 by and is now Loughborough's main

 international runners over the years.

 We use the{University}track which has 
 a curcuit of{400 metres}and also the  
 University pavillion which has        
 changing rooms and a big hall.My dad, 
 Steve Hawkins, is treasurer.He looks  
 after the money.The track is open from
 6.30pm until approx.10.00pm.We go as a
 family group but only my father and I 
 run.Mum takes the money at the door.  </content>
