		<title>13CHESTNUT COPPICE PLANTATIONS</title>
		<content> The Romans were the first to introduce
 chestnut trees to Britain from Italy  
 nearly 2000 years ago.  Now the       
 growing of chestnut trees is a        
 substantial part of the forestry      
 programme of the{Cowdray Estate,}where
 they are grown on the{lower greensand 
{soil}from{Buddington Farm}across to   
{Lodsworth.                            
 The chestnut trees are planted four to
 five feet apart as coppice plants in  
 plantations, on a south facing slope  
 because they need full sunshine for   
 growth.  They need a hot, dry summer  
 and a warm, wet winter.  When the     
 trees are well-established the trunks 
 are cut down to ground level, to a    
 stump or stool.  Clusters of shoots   
 then grow out from the stool.  The    
 shoots are cut when of sufficient     
 height.  In the warm Summer of 1976,  
 they grew 12 feet high.               </content>
