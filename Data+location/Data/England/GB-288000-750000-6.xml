		<title>06A gamekeeper's work.</title>
		<content> Depending on the time of year a       
 gamekeeper usually starts work very   
 early in the morning. The job that Mr.
 Calder likes best is{shooting;}       
 especially at the beginning of        
 September. He shoots about 30 or 40   
 deer a year, sometimes less. These are
 mostly Roe Deer. The meat is sold to  
 the game dealer and the heads are     
 sometimes mounted and given to the    
 people who shoot them. Mr. Calder     
 works on 6 \ thousand acres. Half of  
 this is hill and the other half is low
 ground for shooting pheasants.He      
 doesn't have any bother with poachers 
 except for hill lochs and river       
{poaching}for salmon or trout.Now and  
 then he is bothered with buzzards and 
 eagles which try to take the pheasant 
 chicks.He rears over 1000{pheasants   
 each year.Altogether he has a very    
 interesting life.{                    </content>
