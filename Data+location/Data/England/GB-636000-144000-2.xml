   This farm is situated at the North  
 Western corner of the D. Block.It is a
 mixed farm- rather small -only 500    
 acres. The owner,Mr.Lyons,works there 
 with the help of three other workers. 
 He grows 250 acres of barley,100 acres
 of wheat and 150 acres of grass for   
 fodder.He also has 175 cattle which   
 are a mixture of Sussex,Aberdeen      
 Angus,Hereford and Friesian.          
                                       
   In the harvest season Mr.Lyons uses 
 all his machinery - tractors,combines 
 and binders as this is the busiest    
 time of the year. The farm produces   
 about 900 tons of corn each year and  
 they have to make sure it is dry by   
 using dryers or the dealers will not  
 buy it if it is too damp.
