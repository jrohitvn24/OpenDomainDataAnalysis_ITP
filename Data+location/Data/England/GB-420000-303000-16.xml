 As the name suggests Tamworth's most  
famous building is both a Castle and a 
Museum.                                
 It is {open} every day except Friday  
and Sunday morning from ten in the     
morning until five-thirty. On Sundays  
it is open from two until five-thirty. 
Adults pay sixty-five pence and        
children twenty pence.                 
 The castle was bought by the town in  
1897, the year of Queen Victoria's     
Diamond Jubilee, and two years later   
the Museum opened.                     
 In the {Great Hall} there is some     
chain mail and weapons, an Elizabethan 
dress and some furniture. The wall has 
oak panels. The largest item is a Tudor
Table. Upstairs is a variety of rooms. 
The Long Gallery has a history of      
Tamworth including the Saxon Mill.
