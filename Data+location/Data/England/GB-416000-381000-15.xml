		<content> Today is Thursday! As usual my husband
 Stuart is up with the lark at 6.30 and
 all set to go.  My feet usually hit   
 the floor at about 7.20! A quick      
 breakfast and off with our retriever  
 Shelley for her morning mousing trip  
 in the old quarry.                    
 On arriving downstairs to the smell   
 of my daughter Rachel's bacon butties 
 and my son Mark's burnt toast, I hold 
 a useless conversation with them as   
 they are usually battling it out with 
 words or glued to breakfast           
 television.  Rachel usually brings her
 favourite rabbit in for a quick hop   
 round the room while I eat my one     
 slice of Bovril on toast.  (My diet is
 ruling my life!)  She then feeds the  
 two gerbils, ten goldfish, stick      
 insects, dog and the other rabbit.    
 We go our separate ways at 8.35.
