		<title>15Hanchurch Residential School</title>
		<content>Hanchurch Residential School is        
situated at the edge of Hanchurch      
village. It is bordered by an expanse  
of arable land. The ninety year old    
special school is closing in July 1985.
It was opened in 1819 by the Duchess of
Sutherland to provide holidays for     
miners' children. It was adopted by the
Local Education Authority in 1919 and  
has since provided special care and day
education for sick and socially        
disadvantaged children. Thirty six     
children normally stay in the school   
for a period of twelve months. For     
economic reasons it is now planned to  
incorporate such children either into  
their local school or another special  
school. Officials suggest that over the
last twenty years the general standard 
of living has increased and fewer      
children have special needs. The church
hope to reopen it as an independent one</content>
