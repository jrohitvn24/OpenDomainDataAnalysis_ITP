		<content> The class structure of the British    
 society is even apparent in this small
 section of the country. It is much in 
 evidence in the military ranks and    
 among the civilians too. Income       
 depicts status and status depicts     
 quality of life. The wealthier        
 residents can afford large houses,    
 powerful cars, world travel and       
 speculating on the stock market. Lower
 down the income bracket a comfortable 
 life is still possible if there is    
 more than one wage earner in the      
 family. Many families own two or more 
 cars and enjoy a holiday abroad once a
 year. Only those who are unemployed   
 and rely on the government for their  
 weekly allowance have a day to day    
 existance, having enough money for    
 necessities only. Thankfully these    
 families are in the minority.
