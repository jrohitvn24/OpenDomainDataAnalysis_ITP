		<content>  In the North-West of our block lies  
 several new private housing estates   
 which make up{Kingston Park Estate.   
 Much farmland has disappeared in the  
 last 10 years with extensions to this 
 estate.Only 1 field now separates this
 estate from the large council estate  
 of Newbiggin Hall.                    
  Close to Kingston Park Estate is the{
{Airport Industrial Estate}named after 
 Newcastle Airport which is 2.5 miles  
 away. Originally this estate was      
 composed of large{distribution plants 
 such as those for Newcastle Breweries 
 and Northern Gas.Subsequently,many    
 more service industries have been     
 established in{small factory units.   
 Several units are sub-divided into    
 smaller units for one-man businesses. 
  Although some units remain vacant,the
 estate is still expanding.
