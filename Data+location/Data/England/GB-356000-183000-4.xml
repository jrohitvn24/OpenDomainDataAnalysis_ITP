		<content> The inhabitants are very conscious of 
 the need to conserve our habitat and  
 many are actively involved. One half  
 acre site has been planted by Avon    
 Wildlife Trust for a local farmer with
 2oo native deciduous trees. These will
 be gradually thinned out to leave a   
 wood of larger broad leaved trees.    
 The oak sapplings are  enclosed in    
 square plastic cases 1.5 metres high  
 and 7.5 cms. wide, shown to induce    
 faster growth.                        
   There are many footpaths and        
 bridle_paths in the area but because  
 of the clay beneath these are very    
 muddy after heavy rain.  The local    
 W.I.and other organisations arrange   
 members' walks on some paths to ensure
 these are kept open.  Some have been  
 lost through disuse.  The farmers     
 maintain the footbridges   where paths
 cross ditches or rhines still in use. </content>
