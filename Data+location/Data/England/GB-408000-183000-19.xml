		<title>19New housing on the Expansion</title>
		<content> Over 10 different builders are        
 currently building on the expansion , 
 some{6000 houses}having been built in 
 the past 9 years . Most are simple    
 traditionally built brick and concrete
 houses with extensive use of          
 insulating blocks and{loft insulation 
{in the move to save}energy although   
 surprisingly no builders offer double 
 glazing as a standard feature .       
 Prospective buyers are attracted by   
 downstairs toilets , double garages   
 and one builder offers a free cooker  
 as an added incentive.{Country names  
 like "Westbury Down" and "Oak Meadows"
 are given to sites to promote a rural 
 feeling the irony being that the      
 houses have been built on top of the  
 real countryside . One builder        
 admitted that a{bottle of whiskey}was 
 the prize for the employee who thought
 of the best site name!                </content>
