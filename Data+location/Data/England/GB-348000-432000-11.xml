		<title>11Merry Tree Farm.</title>
		<content>     This farm is situated off {Miller 
Lane,Cottom}.A Mr.and Mrs Taylor have  
rented this farm over the last eleven  
years.Now they are being forced to     
leave their farm.Even now they are     
looking for new premises to restart    
their business again.The reason they   
are being moved out is because Lea and 
Tanterton are merging together as one. 
     The farm covers approximately     
{50} acres.The land is mainly used for 
{grazing},there are no vegitables grown
on the farm as they discovered there is
more profit to be made from animals.The
{livestock} consists of fifty dairy    
cows, eight pigs,twenty five           
geese,ducks and chickens.              
     The land is being used for        
housing.Mr.and Mrs.Taylor were quite   
happy to stay where they were for the  
rest of their lives,but they have to   
move on.                               </content>
