		<title>07  Barham's Disused Railway.</title>
		<content>The Elham Valley Railway ,from         
Canterbury to Folkestone, was opened   
in 1884 and was closed in 1947,when it 
became uneconomic,due to improved road 
travel.It followed a winding route     
passing through Barham.This proved to  
be very useful during World War II,    
when the Boche-Buster gun was kept on  
the line.It had a range of 18 miles,but
could fire in all directions if moved  
along the track.The gun was kept in a  
tunnel in Bourne Park,which had been   
built originally because the owner     
had not wanted to see a railway go     
through his ground.The "cut and cover" 
method was used for the tunnel.Barham  
station was in Heathfield Way,built    
on the site of the track,which together
with Fox Way was named after railway   
workers who lived in cottages on       
Railway Hill.The signal box can be seen
at Arter Bros. garage on the A2.       </content>
