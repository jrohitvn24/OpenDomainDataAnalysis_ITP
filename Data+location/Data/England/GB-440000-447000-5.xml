		<title>05WETHERBY LIBRARY</title>
		<content> This is one of 75 public libraries in 
 the Leeds area, it is staffed by eight
 people - one of whom is a qualifed    
 librarian. Pensioners and mothers with
 young children use the library during 
 the morning, school children come in  
 after school and teenagers and working
 men and women come in the evening. At 
 any one time there are about 11,000   
 books on the shelves and a similar    
 number on loan. About 1000 books are  
 lent to the 250 or so borrowers every 
 day. Other services offered by the    
 library include school visits - so    
 that children can learn how to use the
 library and visits to play-groups for 
 story-telling. Tourist pamphlets and a
 local societies register is kept in   
 the library. There are large print    
 books for the partially sighted and   
 books on cassettes for the blind. A   
 meeting room is available for hire.   </content>
