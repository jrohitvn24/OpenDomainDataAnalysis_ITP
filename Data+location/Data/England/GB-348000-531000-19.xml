		<content> I go to George Bowmans stables        
 which is near to where I live..Most of
 the time I help cleaning the stables  
 out, and sometimes I go riding in the 
 training school.George Bowman is the  
 local horse team driver.He once took  
 the Duke of Edinburgh round Lowther   
 Horse Trials.He is good friends with  
 the Queen.He has two boys one called  
 Brian &amp; the other called Andrew.Andrew
 also goes horse riding. I spend       
 nearly all my spare time watching     
 him training the horses in the        
 training school.After he has finished 
 training them he washes them down with
 the hosepipe. I usually hold the      
 horses for him.We then put them out in
 the fields and then clean the stables 
 out.Then we give them clean water and 
 food.We then put them in to the       
 stables and go home.
