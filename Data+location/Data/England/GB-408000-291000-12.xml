		<title>12THE GUIDED BUS ERDINGTON</title>
		<content> Before the 1950's public road         
 transport in the area was by tram.    
 They had an overhead cable which had  
 electricity running through it. They  
 ran on tracks which were sunk into the
 ground. They turned over to buses for 
 public transport in the 50's. The bus 
 did not have to run on tracks and was 
 powered by a diesel engine. They are  
 mainly double-deckers but some of the 
 buses were single-deckers. On later   
 buses instead of getting on at the    
 back of the bus you get on at the     
 front. When the bus stops the driver  
 opens the doors automatically. In 1984
 they tried an experiment which is a   
 kind of bus called "Tracline 65" which
 ran along tracks and normal roads. The
 bus had 2 arms which fitted to the    
 side of the tracks.  The driver could 
 take his hands off the steering wheel 
 but he doesn't for safety reasons.    </content>
