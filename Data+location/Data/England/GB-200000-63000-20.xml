		<content> Most of the work for the Domesday     
 Project was done by ten of us.(in     
 blue).This meant that it was easy for 
 us to get out to see our twelve       
 squares.We have learnt a lot more     
 about map reading. Our biggest problem
 was feeling that we did not have      
 enough time.Mrs. Springham wanted us  
 to do everything but because the      
 computer played up we have been       
 delayed.                              
 We send best wishes to the children of
 100 years from now -{2086AD.}Lanivet  
 village will still be here but we     
 wonder about the school.

{The other 53 children contributed in  
{some way and so did the teachers. }
