		<title>13Children's Pastimes</title>
		<content>   The children say that the thing they
 most dislike about living in this area
 is that there are not enough friends  
 living nearby. Some of them often feel
 isolated and lonely.                  
                                       
   Their favourite games are football, 
 riding bicycles, and a game called    
 Elastics. This is played by making a  
 series of jumps in and out of a large 
 loop of elastic. They also enjoy      
 looking for creatures in the stream,  
 in holes in dry stone walls, and in   
 hedges, fields and woods. When the    
 snow falls, they use sledges and      
 plastic sacks for tobogganing on the  
 slopes.                               
                                       
   Children's pets include ponies,     
 dogs, cats, rabbits, ferrets, goats,  
 ducks, tropical fish, budgerigars and 
 canaries.                             </content>
