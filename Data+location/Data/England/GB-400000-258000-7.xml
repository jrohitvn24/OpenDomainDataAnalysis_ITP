		<content> Most of the houses, with the exception
 of some farmhouses, were built circa  
 1950. Over the years these have had   
 considerable improvements made to them
 adding extensions, installing central 
 heating and making alterations to both
 the interior and exterior.            
                                       
 There appears to be a house for those 
 farms which are still working for the 
 farmer and his family, but a          
 proportion of those on non-working    
 farms are now used as private         
 residences. Some farms are worked by  
 tenants who occupy the house but      
 most are owned.                       
                                       
 Home ownership in the majority with a 
 very small number of council          
 properties providing accommodation.
