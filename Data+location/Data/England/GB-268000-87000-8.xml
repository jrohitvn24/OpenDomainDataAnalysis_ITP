		<title>08EMPLOYMENT IN/ROUND CHAGFORD</title>
		<content> The opportunities for Employment in   
 Chagford and District are very limited
 being restricted to those in{tourism, 
{agriculture}and{service industries.   
 No heavy or light industry of any note
 exists and many people commute into   
{Exeter, Newton Abbot}and{Okehampton   
 for work. Individuals are known who   
 travel daily to{Totnes}and{Barnstaple.
 Many local people are engaged in{farm 
{work}of one kind or another and this  
 is probably the single most common    
 form of employment.  The situation for
 school_leavers is not very hopeful and
 where there isn't the opportunity to  
 take over the family business the only
 alternative is to look outside Chag_  
 ford.  The summer holiday season does 
 provide some opportunity for{casual   
{labour}for young people but one has to
 be fortunate to obtain regular local  
 employment.                           </content>
