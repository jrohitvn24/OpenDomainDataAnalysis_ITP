		<title>01A landscape of our area</title>
		<content>The area covered by our survey includes
three villages.They are Keele,Knutton  
and Silverdale.The latter was once the 
largest village in England.            
The area is geologically complicated.  
There is one major syncline and an     
anticline which have effected coal     
mining.The area is rich in             
coal,blackband iron ore,clays and      
sandstone.Standing on the Keele Hills  
to the South and looking North, the    
Apedale Fault is a major feature which 
changed the landscape and made coal    
mining possible.                       
As the years have passed transport and 
roads have improved.Although the LMS   
railway once carried passengers into   
Silverdale and Keele,sadly the line is 
now only used by the Colliery.         
Housing has been modernised and extends
in many directions.New factories have  
brought some industrial developments.  </content>
