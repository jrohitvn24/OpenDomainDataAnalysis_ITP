		<content> One of the main trunk roads A.6 runs  
 through the village of Hathern linking
 light industry in our area to easier  
 accessability of nearby airport.It is 
 a very busy road which is a           
 dual_carriageway needed to accomodate 
 large lorries and overseas            
 containers.The rest of the roads are  
 Broads more for the carrying of       
 inhabitance traffic to homes.In our   
 alloted area we have a bridge that    
 carries the M.1 motorway that links   
 London to Scotland.We have a canal    
 used now mainly for pleasure          
 boats.There is also a passenger train 
 track in the area.There is a bus      
 transport system with bus_stops in    
 every area.There are more buses in the
 morning and evening to carry people to
 and from work.
