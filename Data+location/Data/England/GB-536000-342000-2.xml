		<content>   There are no ancient buildings in   
 the block except the three churches of
 Fishtoft, Freiston and Butterwick.    
   Fishtoft Church is called St.       
 Guthlac's and is linked to Crowland   
 Abbey. It has a white flagpole on top 
 of the tower which is paid for by the 
 docks at Boston because it is marked  
 on sailor's charts. It has a very good
 set of bells. The elms around the     
 church have just been cut down because
 of Dutch Elms Disease.                
   Freiston St. James is another very  
 fine church with some Norman work, but
 is mainly much later. It has a lot of 
 brickwork in it and is not set on a   
 mound like Fishtoft.                  
   Butterwick St. Andrew is the least  
 interesting church because very little
 of it is original, many repairs and   
 renovations having taken place in the 
 last 200 years.                       </content>
