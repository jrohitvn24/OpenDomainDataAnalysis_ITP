		<title>12HOME LIFE IN PANTON</title>
		<content>{PANTON }has a very small community and
 the family life within that community 
 tends to be very traditional. In urban
 areas it would probably be considered 
 very old fashioned with the wife      
 cooking the meals and ensuring that   
 her husband has them on time. In urban
 areas where the husband and wife might
 both be employed outside the home this
 pattern is being eroded. Where there  
 are children in the house then the    
 need to transport them to school det- 
 ermines a fairly rigid routine as many
 travel on school transport which keeps
 to a strict timetable and if the      
 children miss that transport then they
 usually have a day off school. Most   
 domestic routines will have an early  
 start because of the time needed to   
 travel to work or school.
