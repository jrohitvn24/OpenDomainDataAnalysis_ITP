		<title>13Jersey Royal Potato 2.</title>
		<content>   In recent years both dead and live  
 beetles have been found on the beaches
 but have not attacked the crops. The  
 potato season is from late May until  
 early July. The farmers take their    
 crops to one of the l2 packing        
 stations where they are graded into   
 Mids and Wares and then weighed and   
 put into 25 kilogram sacks.  The bags 
 are stitched and put onto one ton     
 pallets, which are sent to the harbour
 for export. Only so many tons of      
 potatoes can be handled by the English
 market each day without the price     
 dropping so, when this tonnage is     
 reached, a stop-digging order is      
 imposed to maintain the price.  The   
 industry is very important to Jersey. 
 Last year ll-l2 million pounds        
 worth of potatoes were exported. The  
 Le Maistre station in Trinity packs up
 to 800 tons per week, all for export. </content>
