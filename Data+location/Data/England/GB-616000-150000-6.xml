		<content> Despite its small population, the     
 community has an active social life   
 with dances, discos, coffee mornings, 
 jumbles sales and other fund-raising  
 events. There are several clubs: Youth
 Club, Drama Group, Football, Cricket, 
 and a Horticultural Society which arr-
 anges talks, film shows, outings and  
 an annual Flower Show. However, these 
 groups could not flourish without add-
 itional support from other villages.  
 One popular annual event is the Sheep 
 Dog Trials which attracts competition 
 from all over the country. Stalls and 
 sideshows, which raise money for the  
 church, are added attractons. There is
 a football field, a cricket pitch and 
 a recreation ground for the children. 
 The Village Hall, known as The Conrad 
 Hall, was named after Joseph Conrad   
 (1857-1924) who spent his last years  
 at "Oswalds", a house by the church.  </content>
