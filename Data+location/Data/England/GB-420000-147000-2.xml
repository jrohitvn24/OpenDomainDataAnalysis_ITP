		<title>02TIDWORTH LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content>  Tidworth is set in a slight valley to
 the West of a ridge-line. The land    
 surrounding the built-up area is      
 lightly wooded with large open spaces 
 reaching out towards Salisbury Plain. 
 The ground is predominantly chalk and 
 well drained. At Chalk Pit Hill there 
 is an ancient burial site and also the
 Tidworth pumping station which pumps  
 water to the village. There are many  
 large grassed areas in the village    
 and sportsfields are scattered over   
 the area. Once on the training area to
 the West the landscape becomes an open
 plain with low scrub and grassland.   
 There are small areas of forestry.    
 The River Bourne runs through the     
 village from North to South but it is 
 only a small stream; dry in Summer and
 flowing in Winter and Spring. The area
 is well tended with new trees and     
 flowers planted regularly by the Army.</content>
