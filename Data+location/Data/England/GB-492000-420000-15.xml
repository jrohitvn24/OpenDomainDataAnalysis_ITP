		<title>15WINTERINGHAM METHODISM</title>
		<content> In  1978  a  small,  modern  Methodist
 Church was built. This replaced a very
 large chapel  built  in  West  End  in
 1891. Since  1823  there have been two
 other Methodist chapels opened  in the
 village the most recent in 1978. Serv-
 ices are held each Sunday  morning and
 evening with an  average  congregation
 of  30.  About 35 children  attend the
 weekly  Sunday  School.  Each  month a
 family service is held which is atten-
 ded by other  denominations.  A  large
 barn behind the church has been  reno-
 vated  and  is  used  for  parties and
 functions.    Anniversaries  are  well
 attended  and  followed by teas in the
 barn.  Each  year  a Field Day is held
 with  sports   events  for   children,
 stalls, teas and fancy dress. Trophies
 are awarded for the sports. Wintering-
 ham is part of the Scunthorpe Circuit,
 a shared ministry of six parishes.    </content>
