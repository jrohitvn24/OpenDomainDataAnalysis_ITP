The Flower and Vegetable Show has      
become an annual event. For many years 
there was a Village Carnival, but this 
eventually ceased. Ladies from the W.I.
decided that an event similar to the   
Carnival, that could bring all the     
villages together, was needed. The     
Haywood Flower and Vegetable Society   
was formed, and a committee established
to organise a show. The Countess of    
Lichfield became the President, and    
presented the first cup. Since the     
first show many other people have      
donated prizes. All local organisations
are invited to become involved. The    
society, which has grown in popularity,
is now in its sixth year, and has been 
extended to organise The Rose and Sweet
Pea Show, which may well become another
annual event.
