		<content>{FITTED KITCHEN FURNITURE-}This is a   
 2-man business.The men who run it have
 only been in business for 5 weeks.    
 Previously they were redundant from a 
 similar firm.They use a new material  
 called chipboard covered in "melamine"
 (a hard plastic available in many     
 colours).Chipboard is high density    
 compressed wood chippings and glue.The
 units are made complete in the        
 workshop and fitted into the home.    
{THE FABRICATING COMPANY}employs 3     
 people.Most of the jobs involve       
 welding which requires special        
 training.Products include steel       
 narrowboats,sheet metal farm trailers 
 and fibre glass sailing dinghies.After
 the 1982 recession work is just       
 beginning to increase.The working week
 is 45 hours and it is difficult to    
 find skilled welders who will accept  
 the other work associated with it.    </content>
