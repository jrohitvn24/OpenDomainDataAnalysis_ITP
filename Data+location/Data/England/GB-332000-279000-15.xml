		<content> Clunton is the second largest village 
 in the group of villages comprising   
 Clunbury Civil Parish. It stands on   
 both sides of the road running from   
 Craven Arms to Clun.                  
    The river Clun bounds the village  
 on the south side. It varies in depth 
 from a few inches to several feet.    
 There are trout, bullheads, minnows,  
 crayfish and sticklebacks to be found 
 in various stretches of the river.    
 River birds are moorhens, kingfishers,
 dipper, heron, sandmartin, wagtails   
 and mallard.                          
    A stream flows from above Gunridge 
 to join the river at the Green. Water 
 voles may be found in the stream.     
    Heavy rain causes periodic flooding
 into one cottage during which time the
 owner has to move upstairs.           
 The village has a cafe, caravan site  
 and a packaging factory.              </content>
