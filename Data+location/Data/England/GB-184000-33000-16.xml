		<title>16Shopping Facilities</title>
		<content> As this area of the Roseland Peninsula
 is fairly isolated,very few large     
 businesses have developed.There is a  
 fairly steady trade in the shops from 
 local customers,but in the summer the 
 trade increases a great deal.         
{Shopping Facilities.}                 
 The majority of the shops in the area 
 stock only the basic needs of the     
 customer.Shopping,such as the buying  
 of furniture,clothing and other large 
 items,must be done in St.Austell,Truro
 and Falmouth.                         
 There are clothing shops in St.Mawes  
 itself but,these are very expensive   
 and tend to sell fairly traditional   
 styles.Also they do not stock a great 
 variety of items.The sale of clothing 
 is fairly slow as shops do not have   
 large numbers of customers to keep    
 large stocks or different styles,nor  
 can they follow fashions as stock{PTO </content>
