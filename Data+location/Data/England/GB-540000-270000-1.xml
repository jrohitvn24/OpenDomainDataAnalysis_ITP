		<content>{Willingham, a Fenland Village.}       
 This block includes most of the       
 village of{Willingham}and an area     
 between the village and the{River     
{Great Ouse.}The area is mainly        
 agricultural land with some fruit     
 orchards and market gardening. It is  
 low lying fen land, the highest point 
 being no more than 6 metres above sea 
 level. The village of Willingham with 
 a population of approximately 2700, is
 situated about 10 miles north of the  
 university city of{Cambridge.}It is   
 well served by the main road network, 
 being near the end of the M11 motorway
 and within a few miles of the A1 trunk
 road. The remains of an{Iron Age fort 
 can be seen at Belsar's Hill. The     
 village has expanded rapidly in recent
 years, many of the residents working  
 in Cambridge.
