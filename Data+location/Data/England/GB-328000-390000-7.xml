		<content> smuggling,when men crossed from       
{Wallasey}to what is now the M53       
 motorway.Bidston Hall first came into 
 the hands of the{Vyner}family in the  
 late 17th century.                    
{Sir Robert Vyner}was the creator of   
 many of the regalia now used in       
 coronations.For this he was paid the  
 fortune of Â£31,978 in 1680.The same   
 family also built a 22ft cockpit for  
 sport,which still stands near the     
 hall.The hall was restored in the     
 1960's and is still a family home.    
 Regarding schools,evidence from a will
 suggests a school existed before 1603.
 A school was built in 1636 and then   
 again in{Hoylake Road}in 1837.This    
 school still stands.The old school    
 building was destroyed on 13th March  
 1941 by German incendiary bombs.Now   
 the site houses two new buildings.
