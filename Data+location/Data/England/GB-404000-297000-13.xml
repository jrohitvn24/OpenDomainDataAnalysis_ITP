		<title>13Computers and Calculators</title>
		<content> A computer has a plastic keyboard with
 buttons that have letters on. You type
 in a word. In the end you can make a  
 program that draws pictures and       
 things.{There}are{12 people with      
{computers}and{23 people with          
{calculators}in our class of{26        
{children (Mrs Wilson's).}You can get a
 tape recorder and have a taped program
 to put it. It loads and you can play a
 game with the keys or a joy stick. A  
 calculator is a sort of mini computer 
 except you add up and take away and   
 multiply by and a few other things. In
 Mr. Walsh's class of{29 children,     
{14 have got computers                 
{and 25 have got calculators.
