		<title>03EVIDENCE OF  RURAL HISTORY</title>
		<content>  Two centuries ago the occupants of   
 the cottages at Bottom o'th' Moor,    
 used to be hand loom weavers.The looms
 were housed in the cellars or on the  
 ground floor. Other locals wer        
 employed in the bleaching industry, at
 either Harwood Vale or Firwood works. 
 The "Green" was the centre of the     
 cottages at Bottom o'th' Moor. It was 
 used for Sunday School field days and 
 other events. The Bolton and Bury     
 boundary follows Blackshaw Brook      
 across Breightmet golf course.        
  At Arthur Lane farm ther is evidence 
 of the old law concerning glass tax.  
 This can be seen in the barn as the   
 windows are bricked up. Adjoining the 
 farm is a reservoir where skating     
 parties were held by Thomas Hardcastle
 who was the owner of the Firwood      
 works. Two other reservoirs near Red  
 Lane have now dried up.               </content>
