		<title>19ST.NICHOLAS &amp; ST. FAITH CH.</title>
		<content> THE NAME{ST.NICHOLAS}IS QUITE RARE IN 
 CORNWALL. APART FROM THE ONE IN       
 SALTASH THERE ARE ONLY 3 OTHER        
 CHURCHES WITH THIS NAME IN THE WHOLE  
 OF THE COUNTY. ST.NICHOLAS IS THE     
 PATRON SAINT OF SAILORS.              
 THE CHURCH TOWER WAS BUILT BY THE     
 NORMANS BUT THE BATTLEMENTS WERE      
 REMOVED IN 1730. IT WAS ONLY A CHAPEL 
 OF EASE UNTIL 1881 WHEN IT THEN BECAME
 THE PARISH CHURCH OF SALTASH. THE KEYS
 OF THE CHURCH WERE KEPT BY THE MAYOR  
 AND THE CHAPLAIN WAS PAID BY THE      
 CORPORATION. THE BELL ROPE WAS CHARGED
 ON THE RATES BUT THE CORPORATION WAS  
 RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL REPAIRS ON THE    
 CHURCH.                               
 THE LAST TREES AROUND THE CHURCH WERE 
 REMOVED IN 1962 TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE  
 GRAVEYARD.
