		<title>17New Housing...Marchwood</title>
		<content> Marchwood has three{new housing       
{estates}.Some are still growing in    
 size.They provide housing for all     
 sorts of people,from first time buyers
 to families with several children.Many
 of the occupiers do not live in       
 Marchwood, but in Totton or           
 Southampton.The number of houses in   
 Marchwood has doubled during the last 
 15 years.                             
         The houses vary from one      
 bedroomed flats to 4 bedroomed  houses
 which can cost nearly Â£60,000.Most of 
 the houses are detached.In one type of
 three bedroomed house, there is a     
 built in garage,a lounge leading to a 
 dining room and a well eqipped        
 kitchen.                              
      The estates are attractively laid
 out.The roads are curved,and there are
 turning spaces for cars.
