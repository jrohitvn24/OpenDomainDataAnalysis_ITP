		<title>19Wolsingham Social Concerns</title>
		<content>   A major concern is the future of    
{Hollywood Hall,}a small hospital      
 converted into a psychiatric home for 
 the elderly.The number of wards has   
 already been reduced and total closure
 would mean transferring patients to a 
 psychiatric hospital over 20 miles    
 away.This would involve job losses in 
 an area with over{20% unemployment.   
 Opposition to the closure has been led
 by local trade unions,the District    
 Council and the local M.P.The closure 
 of Hollywood would leave only one     
 small hospital for the old in         
 Weardale.                             
   There is also concern that Weardale 
 might be used for{dumping nuclear     
{waste}in disused lead mines.Though    
 there are no mines in Wolsingham, all 
 waste would have to travel through the
 area.                                 
                                       </content>
