		<content>{THE ASSISTANT MANAGER-MARTON QUARRY.  
{************************************} 
 The company's policy is to appoint a  
 general quarries manager for the whole
 country and then appoint assistant    
 managers at each quarry. High         
 qualifications are necessary rather   
 than local knowledge and the present  
 assistant manager is a young graduate 
 whose home is in London.              
  The job is obviously a stepping stone
 in his career, giving him grass-roots 
 experience. This is evident in the    
 mundane daily operation of the quarry.
  A knowledge of geology is obviously  
 necessary in the reading of test bores
 and local geological maps, but this is
 only a small portion of the work which
 is mainly administrative or the       
 maintenance of equipment.The assistant
 manager feels that the present quarry 
 "still has a few more years in it".   </content>
