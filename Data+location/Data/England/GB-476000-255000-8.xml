		<title>08   Religion  in  Wootton.</title>
		<content>   From our questionnnaire we found    
that the largest single group who      
replied to the question on what        
religious group they belonged to were  
Church of England. About half that     
number were Roman Catholic with a few  
Methodists, Church of Scotland and some
given only as "Christians". There were 
also a number, roughly the same as the 
number of Roman Catholics, who said    
that they had no religious beliefs.    
   Less than one third of the people   
who had religious beliefs said that    
they were regular attenders at         
services.                              
                                       
   We interviewed a local clergyman.   
He said that the most important parts  
of his job were making people think    
and keeping them cheerful.
