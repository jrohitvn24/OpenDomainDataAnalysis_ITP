		<content> During the month of June 1985, an     
 ornithological survey was carried out 
 in the Beaulieu Heath Western area    
 adjoining the A326. The site covered  
 twelve square kilometers of land      
 consisting of heathland, bog areas,   
 Forestry enclosure, woodland, farmland
 and conurbations with the ESSO        
 refinery complex. The habitat within  
 the survey site was varied            
 accomodating a large resident species 
 as well as catering for Summer and    
 Winter visiters.In addition the areas 
 adjoining the S.W.,S. and E sides of  
 the site have a wealth of excellent   
 habitats. With such a rich area it is 
 not surprising to locate a large      
 number of resident and visiting       
 species. Although winter visiters have
 not been mentioned R.S.P.B. records   
 show that they are as prodigeous as   
 the Summer species.                   </content>
