 bloke his drink but when Igot there he
 was dead."                            
    He has never had any money problems
 like peole saying that he has charged 
 them too much.                        
   He has had to throw out a few drunk 
 people who have come from parties.A   
 lot of people visit the pub.          
    He does not have a children"s room 
 but he does have a garden with swings 
 in it.                                
    He owned three other pubs in       
 Cheltenham before he came to the Royal
 Oak.One of these was the Garrick's
