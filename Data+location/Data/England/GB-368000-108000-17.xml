		<title>17Treasure Trove at Pulham</title>
		<content> Mr.S.Drake,a young man farming at     
 Grange Farm,was checking one of his   
 fields before drilling barley,when he 
 turned up a coin which looked unusual.
 He washed it,made some enquiries and  
 discovered he had found a "noble" _ a 
 thin gold coin.During the next 6      
 months he dug up 95 nobles,2 half     
 nobles and 3 quarter nobles.The       
 British Museum confirmed that the     
 coins dated from 1354(Edward III's    
 reign) to 1434(Henry VI's reign) and  
 were probably buried in 1434.After    
 some delay the Treasure Trove was     
 deemed to belong to the man who had   
 dug it up and on whose land it was    
 found.In 1985 the coins fetched       
 Â£63,000 at auction _ a very lucky day 
 for Mr. Drake!
