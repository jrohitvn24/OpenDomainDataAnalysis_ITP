		<title>18THE LINCOLN FESTIVAL.</title>
		<content>{Lincoln Festival of the Arts}is now in
 its {fourth  year }and  it is the main
 festival  in the  region. From the 1st
 of May to the 19th there  are hundreds
 of activities going on  but the actual
{procession}is the  best. It marches up
 from  the {Cornhill }to the{Cathedral.
 Parties  of  bands, fire eaters, large
 and  small  costumes, masks, placards,
 puppets  and  pictures  make  up  the 
 procession. Tourists  watch, often    
 walking  beside  them. When they reach
 the  centre  of  the  town  at  the   
 Cathedral, the{May  King and Queen}are
 crowned by a  celebrity. They sit on a
 throne  decorated  with  flowers  and 
 watch country dancing around a Maypole
 beside  them. The  main  bulk  of  the
 festival, is made up with{music}(folk,
 blues, jazz, rock  and  classical ),  
{theatre, poetry, film}and{exhibitions.
 Pubs, galleries and churches are used.</content>
