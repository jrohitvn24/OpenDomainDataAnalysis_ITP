 The River Stour flows into the sea    
 just east of Richbourgh Power Station.
 Many small pleasure boats sail up and 
 down the Stour. Larger boats such as  
 waste-paper boats, small coastal oil  
 tankers and timber boats can reach as 
 far as the town of Sandwich.  Beacons 
 have been set up to guide large boats 
 away from the muddy banks.            
 On the south bank is Shell Ness which 
 is maintained by the N.T. and Kent    
 Trust for Nature Conservation and the 
 R.S.P.B. and has been made into a     
 restricted area and Nature Reserve.   
 Access to the Shell Ness is only      
 possible from Sandwich as there is no 
 bridge.The spit which forms Shell Ness
 is set aside mainly for the Sandwich  
 Tern and Kentish Plover which breed   
 there regularly each year.
