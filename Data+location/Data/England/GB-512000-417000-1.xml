		<content>{East Halton County School }has three  
 classes in 1985.{Class 1}is for the   
 oldest, aged from 9 to 11,{class 2}is 
 for those who are aged from 6 to 8,   
 and{class 3}is for those aged from 5  
 to 6. This year there are only 42     
 children in the school, last year     
 there were 65.                        
    I like a small school better       
 because you can get lost in a big one.
    I like Physical Education, Art and 
 Craft best. One of my friends likes   
 Mathematics best.                     
    It is a very old school built in   
 1872. Even my dad came to it when he  
 was little.                           
    From the outside the school looks a
 bit like a church. Inside there are   
{four}classrooms, we use one as a hall 
 for P.E. We sit on metal framed chairs
 with plastic seats and write on       
 plastic covered tables.               </content>
