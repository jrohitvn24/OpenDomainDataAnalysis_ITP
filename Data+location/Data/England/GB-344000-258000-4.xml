		<title>04WORK IN WEST LEOMINSTER</title>
		<content>   Employment in this area is almost   
 solely connected with agriculture,    
 with the exception of a small food    
 processing plant and a small          
 structural steel fabrication unit     
 producing mainly agricultural         
 buildings.                            
   There is a high level of casual,    
 seasonal work connected with          
 hop-planting and picking, fruit       
 picking and potato harvesting.  This  
 labour was traditionally supplied by  
 travelling gipsies, but although there
 are still some of these travelling    
 families to be found, students and    
 housewives now provide the greater    
 part of the seasonal labour force.    
   Those not employed in agriculture   
 have to travel either to Leominster or
 Hereford to find employment.          
   Unemployment is high and wages are  
 generally low.                        </content>
