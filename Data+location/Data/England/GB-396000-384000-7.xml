		<title>07THE A6 ROAD</title>
		<content> Most people object to the noise of    
 traffic on the A.6, but some are glad 
 of it because it helps them to get to 
 and  from work quickly.  Old people   
 are frightened because they cannot    
 cross the road fast enough.   There   
 should be more play areas for children
 to keep them off the roads.    It is a
 very busy road and there is a lot of  
 noise, even at night when people are  
 in bed.  People often shop away from  
 the A.6 because it is so busy.  In    
 Disley the A.6 cuts the village in    
 half and there is only one pelican    
 crossing.
