		<content> The building is very smart. We expect-
 ed bricks and cement scattered about. 
 It was the complete opposite.  The    
 garden was well-kept and tidy with a  
 neat lawn and shrubs.  The owner said 
 the{Council}had ordered that the site 
 should look well cared-for.  Tiles are
 on the roof where it faces the road.  
 The company owns an apple orchard at  
 the back. The man gives his employees 
 free apples in autumn.  Outside the   
 building is an old petrol and diesel  
 pump.  These pumps are still in use.  
 There is an old office, but it is not 
 in use.  The site used to be a saw    
 mill.  Every day a lorry comes to     
 collect{plumbing and bathroom equip-  
{ment}because the Lewisham showrooms   
 are not big enough to hold it all.    
 People come here from around Kent and 
 Sussex to buy their goods.
