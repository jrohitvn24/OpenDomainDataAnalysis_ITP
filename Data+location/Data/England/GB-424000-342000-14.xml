 This is an unusual house because it is
 the only one in the area built of blue
 stone, which is found in Middleton-by-
 Wirksworth. There is a later addition 
 of brick. There is theory that the    
 house was originally a Public House   
 hence the unusual name. Mr George     
 Smith who lives here  is a relief     
 postman &amp; small farmer. He has no     
 grumbles about the local gypsies &amp; has
 grown up with them. Dutch elm disease 
 was very prevalent here. All the dead 
 trees are cut down &amp; replanting of    
 oaks has taken place. There is mains  
 water, electricity,&amp; septic tank.     
 Mr.Smith was born at Kingsgrove Farm  
 nearby. The land is owned by          
 Brailsford Estates.
