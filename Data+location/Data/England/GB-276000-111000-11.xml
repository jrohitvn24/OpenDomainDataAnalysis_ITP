		<title>11E.WORLINGTON POST OFFICE</title>
		<content> The Post Office has a thatched roof   
 and it is over 400 years old.It used  
 to be just a shop but the old post    
 office closed down and moved into the 
 shop about 20 years ago.The whole     
 building is under alarm because of    
 burglars.The post comes before school 
 and there are collections at 9a.m. and
 3p.m. Mr and Mrs. Corley who own the  
 Post Office at the moment have only   
 been living there for eight           
 months.Every fortnight they order     
 things to sell from the shop.They open
 at 9.00 until 1.00 then 2.00 until    
 5.30. On Thursday and Saturday they   
 only open in the morning.Mr. and Mrs. 
 Corley not only run the Post Office   
 but they sometimes take people to     
 places if there is no transport and   
 they also book for the Parish Hall and
 put up posters for the public.
