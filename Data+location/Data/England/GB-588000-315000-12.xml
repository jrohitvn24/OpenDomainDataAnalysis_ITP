		<title>12 INDUSTRY-FUTURE IN LITCHAM</title>
		<content>Our ideas of future development in the 
area of Litcham   are to extend it so  
more modern housing can be built.      
More farming equipment is needed.This  
would produce more jobs for the        
unemployed.These workers can live in   
the new houses.                        
 Roads need improving as they are in   
such bad state especially small by     
roads.This is caused by lorries,farm   
machinery and bad weather.             
 Litcham would be a good place for     
light industry as it is near coastal   
ports and near Fakenham.This would     
supply more jobs for youngsters and the
unemployed.                            
 Litcham would need more amenities for 
children and adults.There are two pubs 
at the moment,if there were sports     
centres and clubs this would all mean  
that all the family could enjoy        
thenselves together.                   </content>
