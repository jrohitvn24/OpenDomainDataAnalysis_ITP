		<title>03TRANSPORT IN PRIVETT</title>
		<content> One regular bus service operates      
 between Winchester and Petersfield    
 along the A272, picking up passengers 
 at the West Meon Hut, a walk of 2-3   
 miles for the Privett villagers.  From
 the village one bus in each direction 
 takes and returns school children and 
 those whose business is in Alton.  On 
 Wednesdays the yellow Plus Bus takes  
 shoppers to Petersfield market, making
 extra use of a school bus.   For the  
 scattered Privett families a car is a 
 necessity. Most housewives drive to   
 the shops,doctor, dentist and share   
 the school run. Transport is an aspect
 of country-dwelling which brings most 
 problems.  Well-catered for during    
 their school years, young people need 
 to travel longer distances for        
 employment.  At l6 most youngsters    
 use mopeds and they will learn to     
 drive as soon as legally possible.    </content>
