      Wide belts are liked by both the 
 children and the teenagers.They are   
 very fashionable at the moment. Medium
 belts are preferred by adults,and     
 narrow ones are popular with all ages.
{COLOURS.}                             
       Blue is the colour most worn in 
 this area.Pink,being very fashionable,
 is a close runner up.Quite popular are
 the colours red,grey,white and black. 
 Green,yellow and brown are only       
 sometimes worn. People rarely wear    
 lemon,maroon,ginger,turquoise or      
 purple.Nobody in our survey ever wears
 anything orange.                      
        White is a favourite with the  
 young,but not the adults.Green is     
 rather liked by adults,but not by the 
 young.
