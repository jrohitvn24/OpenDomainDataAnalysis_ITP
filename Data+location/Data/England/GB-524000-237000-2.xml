		<content> There have been settlements in the    
 survey block since prehistoric times. 
 Traces of a{prehistoric hill-fort and 
{field system}have been found at Arbury
 Banks, about 1 Km. south-west of      
 Ashwell centre. There are ring ditches
 and enclosures at Slip End, about 2Km.
 east of the village.                  
 In the middle ages Ashwell was an     
{important market town.}Remains of this
 can be seen in the large 14 Century   
 Church and the half-timbered Tudor    
 building which now houses the Museum. 
 Other buildings of historical         
 significance include the 14 Century   
 Foresters' Cottages; 15 Century       
 Bear House; the 16 Century St. John's 
 Guildhouse, Dixie's Farm and Duck Lake
 Farm;the 19 Century Rectory and the   
 Tudor Chantry House.                  
 All these give a period flavour to    
 Ashwell (see also page 19)            </content>
