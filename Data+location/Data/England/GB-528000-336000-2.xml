		<title>02A Day in My Life</title>
		<content>    I am an 11 year 0ld boy and I live 
 in the country with my parents and    
 brothers and sisters.At 7:15 every    
 morning I get up and prepare for      
 school.I usually wear grey trousers,a 
 blue T-shirt and a grey pullover.After
 breakfast my brother and I cycle to   
 the bus stop which is about a mile    
 away from the house.The bus picks us  
 up at 8:30am and takes us to Kirton   
 Primary School with several other     
 children.When we arrive there we play 
 in the playground until the bell rings
 and lessons begin.We start with       
 Assembly and then have mathematics,   
 English,science,history or geography  
 and sometimes P.E. or games.We do     
 quite a lot of art and craftwork after
 eating our packed lunch.Ay 3:15 the   
 bus takes us home again,and we cycle  
 to our house.After tea I play with my 
 friends or watch T.V. until 9:30.     </content>
