		<content>   This block is in the{Vale of York   
 about 7 miles West of the city,       
 straddling the main A59 road and BR   
 line between {York}and{Knaresborough.}
   The land is extremely flat and      
 almost entirely devoted to arable     
 farming.  The survey was carried out  
 in November 1985 so many fields were  
 lying ploughed and bare.  What crops  
 were sown were primarily sugar beet   
 (there is a processing plant a few    
 miles away) and winter wheat.  Much of
 the rest of the land is given over to 
 grassland, either intensively managed 
 or rough grazing.                     
   The Southern border of the block    
 includes part of{Marston Moor}which   
 was the site of an important Civil War
 battle in 1644, resulting in a key    
 victory for Parliamentary forces.
