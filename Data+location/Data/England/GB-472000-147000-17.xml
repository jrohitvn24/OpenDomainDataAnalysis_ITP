		<content> BECAUSE OUR AREA IS A RURAL ONE THERE 
 ARE ALWAYS NUMEROUS BIRDS TO BE SEEN. 
 BESIDES HAVING FIELDS, WOODS, AND     
 HEDGEROWS THERE ARE ALSO HOUSES SO THE
 AREA ATTRACTS A VARIETY OF BIRDS THAT 
 THRIVE IN DIFFERING ENVIRONMENTS.  ON 
 A JUNE DAY A GROUP OF US SAW THE      
 FOLLOWING BIRDS WHILE STANDING IN THE 
 SCHOOL GROUNDS: PIDGEON, CROW, ROOK,  
 JACKDAW, BLACKBIRD, THRUSH, ROBIN,    
 CHAFFINCH, BULLFINCH, SPARROW, DUNNOCK
 AND SWALLOW (THIS BIRD HAD A NEST     
 UNDER THE EAVES OF THE SCHOOL ROOF).  
 BESIDES SEEING THESE COMMON BIRDS FROM
 THE SCHOOL GROUNDS, WHEN WE WALKED IN 
 DIFFERENT PARTS OF OUR BLOCK, WE SAW  
 GREEN WOODPECKERS, KESTRELS, SWIFTS,  
 HOUSE MARTINS, WRENS, WILD DUCKS AND  
 GEESE, SWANS AND COOTS (THESE WATER   
 BIRDS WERE ON THE VILLAGE POND). WE'VE
 NOTICED A LARGE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER
 OF JAYS IN THE AREA THIS YEAR.        </content>
