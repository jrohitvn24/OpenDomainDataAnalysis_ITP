		<title>20A TRANSECT ALONG PLYMYARD AV</title>
		<content> If one were to travel from the        
 northern end of Plymyard Avenue to the
 southern end a journey of just under  
 two miles it is possible to detect in 
 the nature of the houses the          
 changes that have gone on in the whole
 area in the last 70 years.            
                                       
 At the north end there are still to be
 found some large Victorian villas     
 although some of these have either    
 lost their very extensive gardens to  
 more modern housing developments or   
 been pulled down entirely to make way 
 for a smal estate of exclusive houses.
 In the 1930's much of the southern end
 of the avenue was a very wet marsh and
 supported only one pig farm.Today all 
 that has changed and a modern private 
 estate of detached ,semi-detached and 
 dorma bungalows fills in all the      
 remaining space.                      </content>
