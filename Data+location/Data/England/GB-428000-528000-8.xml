		<title>08My Saturday in Chilton.</title>
		<content>   On a Saturday morning my brother and
 I get up at 8 o'clock, get washed,    
 dressed and have our breakfasts       
 (Weetabix and a hot cup of tea). We   
 then go down to the newsagent's to get
 our Dad a paper.When we get back we go
 into the living room to watch the     
 television. After this we will go and 
 call for our friends to play football 
 on the school field.                  
   At 12 o'clock we go home to get our 
 dinners, which may be fish and chips. 
 After dinner we go to Bishop Auckland 
 to have a look around the shops. I    
 sometimes buy a computer game with my 
 pocket money.                         
   When we get back home at about 3    
 o'clock all the football teams will be
 kicking off. We watch the television  
 and when the scores are read out we   
 make a note of them all.
