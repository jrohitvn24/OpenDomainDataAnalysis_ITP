		<title>20MARKET STREET - HEDNESFORD</title>
		<content> In the 1920s Market Street served a   
self-sufficient mining community. The  
Anglesey Crescent was built as a bus   
station and the railway provided       
transport to Walsall and Rugeley.Locals
travelled by bicycle and horses pulled 
milk floats. In the 1930s the miners   
suffered hardship and the two pawn-    
brokers were well used. Residents can  
see little change in the main street   
but notice a marked difference in the  
attitude of the community to each      
other. The sense of community was      
tremendous in the mining town ,but is  
missing today.There was no vandalism   
and horseplay was in good spirit. Today
this has changed.
