		<content>   Mr Harry Barber,77 was born and bred
 in the village. He remembers Balderton
 as a pleasant rural spot with many    
 green fields. There were at least ten 
 farms and Main Street was often       
 crowded with animals being taken to   
 Newark market.                        
   He recalls the pen in Pinfold Lane  
 where stray animals were kept until   
 being claimed by their owners. Next to
 the John Hunt School was the Wash Dyke
 which gave drovers the chance to wash 
 their cattle.                         
   It was from the Cock Inn that the   
 horse bus departed. Another bus left  
 from Milton Street.                   
   The large houses in Balderton owned 
 by the brewing and brick making       
 families often opened their gardens to
 the public, and many charities        
 benefitted from the money raised.     
 Little vandalism existed at the time. </content>
