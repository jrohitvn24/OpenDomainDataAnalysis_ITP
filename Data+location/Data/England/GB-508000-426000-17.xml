		<title>17HULLS MUSEUMS</title>
		<content> Hull certainly seems to like its      
 Museums. There are 3 Museums in the   
 city centre each dealing with a       
 different aspect of Hulls history. The
 most popular is also the most central,
 the Town Docks Museum, housed in the  
 old Dock Offices which were built in  
 1871.  The theme here is a maritime   
 one, with special interest in whaling,
 137,000 people visited last year.  On 
 the old High Street are 2 museums one 
 based on Wilberforce House containing 
 furniture and things to do with the   
 slave trade which William Wilberforce 
 helped abolish. 54,000 people visited 
 it last year.  Finally there is the   
 Transport and Archiology museum housed
 in the old Corn Exchange.  Together   
 with old forms of transport we have   
 some of the best Roman Mosaics in     
 Britain and 54,600 people visited last
 year.                                 </content>
