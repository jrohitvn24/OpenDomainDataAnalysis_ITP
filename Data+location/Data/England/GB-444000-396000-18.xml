		<title>18THOMAS HILL, VANGUARD WORKS</title>
		<content>   Thomas Hill is situated at the side 
 of the railway line.  It is a small   
 firm which manufactures locomotives as
 well as rebuilding and servicing them.
 Their workshops also service heavy    
 duty diesel engines for earth movers  
 and cranes.                           
   If a locomotive was something wrong 
 with it, it is taken to Thomas Hill by
 lorry.  Once there the locomotive is  
 taken into the workshop and stripped  
 down so the men can find out what is  
 wrong.  When it has been repaired, a  
 lorry comes to take it back to its    
 owners.  A crane lifts the engine on  
 to a lorry.                           
   When Thomas Hill build a new        
 locomotive they use Rolls Royce       
 engines.  Locomotives from Thomas Hill
 can weigh from 25 to 75 tonnes and go 
 all over the world.
