		<title>02HINXHILL ESTATE FARM 1</title>
		<content>Hinxhill Estate Farm covers a total    
area of 640 hectares.100 hectares of   
this land is not farmed due to the     
position of marsh,woodland and an      
area of peat bog which is situated     
through a part of the farm.The land    
running through Hinxhill Farm is       
varied. It is made up of gault         
clay,greensand, chalk and the peat     
which is 6m in places.This peat can be 
treated and fenced off but it is more  
economical to just let grass cover it. 
The strip of peat soil is very acidic  
and the wooden fence posts would be    
destroyed in a very short time. It was 
considered that it could be cut up and 
used for fuel purposes but again it is 
not economical to do so. In the last 20
years the size of the average field has
greatly increased. This is due to      
hedgerows being torn up to make way for
the entry of large machinery.          </content>
