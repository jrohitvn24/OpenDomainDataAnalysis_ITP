		<title>05DONNA'S SCHOOL DAY</title>
		<content> Friday morning,school 'YUK',as soon   
 as I got to school the buzzer went    
 (schoolbell).Quickly I went into the  
 classroom where I saw Rachael White   
 sitting on a chair giggling to        
 herself, I asked her what the joke was
 she replied "Darren T. did an enormous
 burp,".While we were still laughing,  
 Mrs.Wells walked in and threatened us 
 Then Mrs.Wells asked Samantha and     
 Jenny to give out the maths books!    
 Suddenly someone burst out laughing it
 was Martin Hunt he was looking through
 a plastic camera Rachael poked me in  
 the ribs and said,"Whats going on?"I  
 replied,"Theres some rude pictures in 
 that camera."Rachael then asked "who's
 camera is that?" "Clive Andrew's"I    
 said.Mrs. Wells suddenly shouted"BE   
 QUIET".In the afternoon we did some   
 sewing, at the end of school I said to
 Rachael "See you on Monday".          </content>
