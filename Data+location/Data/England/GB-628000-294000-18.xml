		<title>18RELIGION:WOODTON</title>
		<content> Woodton Anglican church is in the     
 Depwade Deanery in the Diocese of Nor-
 wich.Since 1926 the parish has been   
 linked with Bedingham but in 1964 it  
 was joined with Hempnall,Topcroft,    
 Morningthorpe,Fritton,Hardwick &amp; Shel-
 ton so it is ecclesiastically one of 8
 in the Hempnall Group of parishes     
 which in 1985 joyfully celebrated 21  
 years together.There are 2 full-time  
 priests,one living in Woodton,the     
 other in Hempnall.The staff is aug-   
 mented by a non-stipendiary priest,an 
 educationalist resident in Topcroft;  
 several retired clergy;&amp; a team of lay
 ministers who help with both pastoral 
 &amp; liturgical work.The C13 building has
 a nave &amp; chancel,plus a south aisle.  
 The tower is a typical round Norfolk  
 one,possibly Saxon with a C14         
 octagonal top.A vestry was added in   
 the 1920s;the 6 bells rehung in 1984. </content>
