		<content> Every Kilometre square in this area   
 includes arable grassland.  Sheep     
 predominate over cattle, though there 
 are a few herds of freisians, which   
 are mostly reared for the production  
 of beef. Only one farm  of the l5 in  
 the area has a milking herd. Crops    
 grown include wheat, winter barley,   
 flax and oil seed rape.  These crops  
 are harvested betwen June and August  
 for the corn and rape, and the flax in
 October - all by combine harvester.   
 If the corn is wet it is dried before 
 marketing.  One farm has a dryer.  The
 grass is cut and made into silage in  
 spring and in the summer is cut for   
 hay, both being used for cattle fodder
 during the winter.  There are four    
 market gardens growing vegetables and 
 flowers, one supplying direct to the  
 trade and the rest either selling from
 the premises or supplying retailers.  </content>
