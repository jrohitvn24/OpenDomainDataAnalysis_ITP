		<content> The politics of the area are not      
 particularly causing any problems in  
 the area between neighbouring towns,  
 as the majority of the people are     
 Supporters of the Labour Party.The    
 area has always been a Labour strong  
 hold and the Conservatives have yet   
 to be accepted as M.P.'s for the local
 area.                                 
   The community does take an active   
 part in politics, and meetings of the 
 Labour party are held frequently in   
 the local libraries, but the other    
 parties are only heard of at election 
 times.
