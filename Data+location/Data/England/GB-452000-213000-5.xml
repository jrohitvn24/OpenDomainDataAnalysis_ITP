This village,about two miles SE of     
Islip,is strung out along a side road  
which ends abruptly on the edge of     
Otmoor.There are two farms,a pub called
the Plough,a small church,and a pie    
factory in one of the farm             
buildings.There is a good playing      
field and sports pavilion,and a small  
garden centre in the grounds of the    
school which was closed many years ago 
and is now a private house.            
      An old rhyme believed to date    
from the Otmoor riots starts like this:
    I went to Noke                     
    and nobody spoke                   
and ends like this:                    
    But when I went to Beckley         
    There they spoke directly          
No indication is given of allegiances. 
Some sources attribute this rhyme to   
the Civil War period.                  </content>
