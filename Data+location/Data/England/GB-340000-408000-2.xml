 During 1982 the Council agreed to     
 explore the possibility of entering   
 into a Town Twinning arrangement with 
 a European town.                      
 In 1983 the Council decided to        
 formalise a twinning agreement with   
 Cergy_Pontoise in France.             
 Cergy_Pontoise lies 20 miles north    
 west of Paris and is similar to       
 Ormskirk and West Lancashire in that  
 the population is about 110,000 and   
 contains a new town similar to        
 Skelmersdale with a population of     
 40,000. as well as a number of small  
 villages in it's vicinity. Pontoise is
 a market town like Ormskirk and       
 although it is so close to Paris it is
 in open countryside and a rich        
 agricultural area similar to the West 
 Lancashire Plain which surrounds      
 Ormskirk.                             </content>
