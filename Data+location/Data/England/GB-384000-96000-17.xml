		<title>17     The Church</title>
		<content>      Most of the church was built in  
 the fourteenth century with           
 alterations and additions during the  
 sixteenth and nineteenth centuries.It 
 is dedicated to St. Nicholas. Until   
 1972 it was a Chapel of Ease to Bere  
 Regis. Now it is part of a group of   
 parishes called Red Post. The vicar   
 is the Rev. Hugh Maddox. There is a   
 parochial church council which looks  
 after  the church . Besides services  
 on a Sunday there is a Sunday School  
 and a Mothers Union.                  
        The  church bells are not safe 
 to ring at the moment, so money is    
 being collected to repair them and to 
 do other repairs around the church.   
        The churchyard is closed and   
 people are now buried in the new      
 cemetery at Broadclose.               
        We had a sponsored walk and    
 collected Â£120 for the church.        </content>
