		<content> Our block is mainly rural with some   
 very muddy footpaths through the      
 fields,nearly all puddles in April.No 
 snakes were seen and no lives were    
 lost.Less than a quarter is housing,  
 comprising two villages;the larger    
 one,Stainforth has about 7500 people. 
 The smaller,Fishlake about 1000.      
 Stainforth ,as Stenforde is mentioned 
 in the first Domesday Book.The first  
 houses in Stainforth were near the    
 river Don,and then the canal,because  
 of the importance of canal traffic.Our
 village stainforth used to be one of  
 the main stops on the Don.Stainforth  
 has a market charter dating from      
 1348.Hatfield Colliery was first      
 started in 1911.From 1926 the         
 population soared because people      
 flooded in from other areas to work in
 the pit.
