		<title>07SOILS OF FELTWELL</title>
		<content>   The earliest settlement at Feltwell 
 was built on the edge of the chalk    
 escarpment where it sloped gently down
 to what was then marshy fen, suitable 
 only for rough grazing in summer and  
 for cutting peat as fuel. The economy 
 was pastoral until changing           
 agricultural needs brought in arable  
 crops to the chalklands. Draining of  
 the fens began in the 17th century but
 it was not until the Second World War 
 that much of the black fen was finally
 cleared of scrub to become some of the
 richest land in the country. The peat 
 has wasted away so much that much land
 is now below sea level and farmers    
 plough up the fen clay which was the  
 seat earth for the forests which grew 
 in the district in prehistoric times. 
 The trees which formed the peat are   
 often ploughed up and are called 'bog 
 oak' by local farmers.                </content>
