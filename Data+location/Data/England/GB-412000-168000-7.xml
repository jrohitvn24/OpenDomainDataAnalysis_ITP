		<title>07The River Kennet</title>
		<content> Wiltshire's chalk country is often    
 parched in the summertime. When the   
 water has sunk into the chalk which   
 holds it like a sponge, it reaches the
 greensand and the clay which lie      
 beneath it. The water cannot sink     
 through the clay. Consequently it     
 breaks out of the ground in springs   
 at places where the greensand is      
 exposed, either in the Kennet valley  
 or along the edges of the chalk       
 covering.                             
 If you study a map of this area, the  
 villages have clearly grown up around 
 rising springs. The{River Kennet}has  
 water meadows on either side. In the  
 meadows the water table is only just  
 below ground level. The volume of     
 water in the river is increased by    
 springs at Kennett, Lockeridge, and   
 Clatford. In the winter the ground is 
 flooded by the swollen river.         </content>
