		<title>15RELIGION IN LINTON</title>
		<content>   There are three churches in Linton, 
 the Church of England,the United      
 Reformed Church and the Salvation     
 Army Citadel.There are 3 services     
 held each week.Linton has 3 vicars    
 who take the services,most of which   
 are held on a Sunday.In an ordinary   
 service there are hymns,readings from 
 the bible,prayers and sermons from    
 the vicars.Halfway through the        
 service there is a collection.The     
 money they raise is used for hymn     
 books and bibles.There are also other 
 ways that they raise money,by coffee  
 mornings,jumble or garage sales.About 
 300 people attend church each week.   
    The churches are looked after by   
 wardens who cut the grass and clean   
 the pews.                             
    In church a Sunday school is held  
 for children.The main religion in     
 Linton is Christian.                  </content>
