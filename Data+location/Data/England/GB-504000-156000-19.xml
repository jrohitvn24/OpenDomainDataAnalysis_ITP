		<title>19ROLE OF THE CHURCHES.</title>
		<content> Of the three churches in this Block,  
 Ockham is the subject of a Special    
 Feature.  Wisley is a tiny Norman     
 church and Ripley was rebuilt but     
 keeps its Norman chancel. Pyrford is a
 very active Parish with two churches  
 just outside the area although only   
 10% of the population are regular     
 churchgoers clergy remain influential 
 in local affairs. Many non-residents  
 visit and attend Ockham. Most villages
 in the area are nominally C.of E.;    
 there are also non-conformists and    
 Roman Catholics. Ripley has Methodist 
 and a Baptist chapels. A minority are 
 agnostic or are apathetic, mostly     
 amongst Ockham's newcomers. All church
 goers are keen to maintain a christian
 community in the four villages. Most  
 marriages take place in Church; most  
 funerals are cremations.
