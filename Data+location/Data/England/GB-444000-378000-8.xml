		<title>08A Killamarsh Miner</title>
		<content> We walked there with our teacher and  
 talked to the Miner in his home. He   
 told us that in his spare time he     
 likes watching football, gardening and
 swimming. He goes swimming in         
 Eckington Baths. He has lived in      
 Killamarsh for nine and a half years. 
 He enjoys working down the Pit but    
 doesn't enjoy Night Shift. His job is 
 a Supervisor. When the strike was on  
 he didn't like it because the other   
 men wanted him to go on strike but his
 Union weren't on strike so he couldn't
 He had nothing to do when he was on   
 strike but he still got paid. He told 
 us that in the pit they hold the roof 
 up with steel girders and sometimes   
 just ordinary timber. High Moor Pit,  
 where he works, has Trackless Vehicles
 which run along the Galleries carrying
 materials to the Coal Face. The coal  
 is removed from the pit on conveyors. </content>
