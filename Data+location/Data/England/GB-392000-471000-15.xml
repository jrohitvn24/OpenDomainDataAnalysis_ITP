		<title>15FLOWERS IN LITTONDALE</title>
		<content>   The most widespread wayside flower  
 in summer is sweet cicely, replaced   
 later by meadowsweet and meadow       
 cranesbill. As well as the more common
 flowers, ox-eye daisy, scabious,      
 valerian, Jacobs ladder and harebell  
 are found on uncut verges. Primrose   
 and cowslip still occur but are       
 decreasing. Giant bell-flower, the    
 rare Saracen's woundwort and lilies of
 the valley are found. Kingcups,       
 mimulus, wood aven and brooklime are  
 found by streams, bird's-eye primrose,
 butterwort and mountain pansy on      
 fellsides along with thyme, milkwort, 
 tormentil and rockrose.  Betony grows 
 on damp pastures.  In the grikes on   
 the limestone pavements wood anemone, 
 wood-sorrel, hart's-tongue fern and   
 herb robert survive as relics of      
 ancient woodland as well as on the    
 valley bottom.                        </content>
