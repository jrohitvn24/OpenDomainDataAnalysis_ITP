		<title>10Didbrook in 1950</title>
		<content>{Didbrook}in 1950 was a thriving       
 village whose inhabitants enjoyed 3   
 shops and a blacksmith. The shops     
 comprised of a butcher, situated next 
 to the school; the baker's shop where 
 the bread and cakes were baked on the 
 premises; and lastly Mrs. Innes' sweet
 shop. In the middle of Didbrook was   
 the blacksmith who was much in demand 
 from the surrounding farms. He also   
 had a petrol pump which had a winding 
 handle to dispense the petrol. Almost 
 all the villagers were employed by the
 farms and{Stanway Estate,}but the     
 railway was also a major employer,    
 thereby keeping village life very     
 close. Transport was provided by      
 trains and a local coach company,     
 Harrisons, who provided a bus service 
 on a Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.
