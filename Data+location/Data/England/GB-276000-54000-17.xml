		<title>17Old Mills in Harbertonford</title>
		<content> There are several large mills in      
 Harbertonford which are no longer used
 as mills.  I live in one that has been
 converted into sort of flats.  It is  
 very nice but rather unusual.  The    
 rooms have very high ceilings.        
                                       
 In the mill next to our block of flats
 they restore pine doors and furniture.
 They have a huge tank that they dip   
 the furniture in to remove all of the 
 old paint.  They have got some nice   
 kitchen tables and dressers.          
                                       
 The next mill along is used as a      
 warehouse.  They store animals feeds  
 in there.  Not hay but bags of        
 concentrated feed like horse nuts, cow
 cake and chicken pellets.             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
