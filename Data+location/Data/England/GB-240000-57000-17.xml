		<title>17CHILDREN'S LEISURE</title>
		<content> WE SURVEYED 64 CHILDREN BETWEEN THE   
 AGES OF 8 AND 10 YEARS TO FIND WHAT   
 THEY ENJOYED DOING IN THEIR SPARE     
 TIME. HERE ARE OUR RESULTS:-          
 FOOTBALL  28  MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS 35  
 CHESS     18  LISTENING TO MUSIC  41  
 MARBLES   39  WATCHING T.V.       59  
 ATHLETICS 35  STAMP COLLECTING    22  
 READING   50  CUBS/BROWNIES       29  
 DANCING   13  RIDING BIKE         53  
 SWIMMING  45  GYMNASTICS          29  
 SNOOKER   26  YOUTH CLUB          16  
 FROM THIS WE DECIDED THAT WE MUST LIVE
 IN QUITE AN AFFLUENT AREA. MOST       
 CHILDREN PREFER OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES    
 WHEN THE WEATHER PERMITS. THERE ARE   
 VARIED INTERESTS RANGING FROM         
 ORGANISED PERSUITS TO PERSONALLY      
 INITIATED HOBBIES. WE CONCLUDED THAT  
 MANY ADULTS ARE PREPARED TO SPEND     
 THEIR OWN LEISURE TIME TO HELP        
 CHILDREN PERSUE THEIR OWN INTERESTS.  </content>
