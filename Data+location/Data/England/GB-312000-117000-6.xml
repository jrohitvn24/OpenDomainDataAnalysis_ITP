		<title>06The M5 Motorway</title>
		<content>   The constuction of the Wellington   
 section of the M5 motorway between    
 Chelston and Willand began in 1974 and
 was completed in October 1976.        
   A survey was taken on the morning   
 of Friday 5th July.Fifeteen minute    
 samples of the North and South bound  
 carrigeways were taken.               
   Most of the holiday traffic was     
 travelling North. There were 3 mobile 
 homes, 22 caravans, 22 cars with      
 evidence of luggage and 2 camping     
 trailers travelling North.Ther ewre no
 mobile homes,11 caravans, 19 cars with
 luggage and 2 trailers travelling     
 south.Normally traffic at this time of
 the year is coming southwards.The     
 reason for these different results is 
 that people were travelling home in   
 the early part of the morning and     
 those coming on holiday had not yet   
 reached this part of the country.     </content>
