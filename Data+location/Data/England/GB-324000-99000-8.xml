		<title>08DALWOOD READING ROOM</title>
		<content> The Reading Room in Dalwood was built 
 originally to hold books for which    
 there was no room in the school, as a 
 library. A plaque outside the Reading 
 Room reads 'This Institute was founded
 by Miss Susan Wakley on land given by 
 Miss M. Brown'. It is said that the   
 room was built to keep men out of the 
 pub.The room is now regularly used by 
 eleven men as a snooker room, with    
 darts, table tennis and cards. Women  
 are allowed to join but no women come.
 There are no books there now.         
   The Reading Room was built in 1903. 
 It is solidly built of stone with a   
 high beamed roof. One school governor,
 Mr Harry Lawrence has been going to   
 the Reading Room for twenty seven     
 years since he was a boy.             
   The room is now only used on        
 Wednesdays.
