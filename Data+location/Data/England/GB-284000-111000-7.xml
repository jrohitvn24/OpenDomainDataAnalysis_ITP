		<content>   Machinery and electricity are vital 
 and used extensively. Small units have
 one tractor each. Larger units have   
 three or four plus trailers, loaders, 
 mowers, dung-spreaders, combine-      
 harvesters, balers, etc. Stationary   
 equipment such as milking-machines,   
 grain-augers and mills add to the     
 large capital investment per hectare. 
 Contractors are hired for most of the 
 silage-cropping and harvesting and for
 the bulk of the hedge-trimming.       
 Family labour is used on all farms.   
 The farmer and a son or daughter      
 share all outdoor work. This means    
 twice-daily milking, tending of stock 
 and calf-rearing. With lambing,       
 cultivations and harvesting this      
 amounts to an average twelve-hour day.
 The wife also contributes a few hours 
 daily. Four farms each employ one man 
 costing Â£7500 yearly, net wage Â£5000. </content>
