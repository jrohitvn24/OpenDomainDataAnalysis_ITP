In Yardley Hastings Primary School     
there are 2 classes with 35 children   
all together, 15 in the infants and 20 
in the juniors with an even number of  
boys and girls. They have quite a      
small playground but a big playing     
field. For their lunches they use the  
hall across the road,they  also use    
this hall for P.E and  assemblies.They 
do not have any hot   dinners,all the  
children bring  sandwiches. When the   
school goes out on  trips, the         
Headteacher books the minibus  which   
they share with 13 other village       
schools.In 1984 the school was given a 
computer, and the disc drive and       
printer were bought from the proceeds  
of the "Yardley Hastings Society"      
annual fete. The old school house next 
to the school is used as the           
secretaryÂ£s office and store room      </content>
