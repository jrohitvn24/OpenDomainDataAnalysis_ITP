		<title>02PRINCIPAL FEATURES: QUINTON</title>
		<content>   This block is centred around the    
 villages of{Upper and Lower Quinton,  
 which lie just North of{Meon Hill,}at 
 the northern limit of the{Cotswolds.  
 Being very near the borders of Gloucs.
 and Worcs. the area reflects much of  
 the character of the Vale of Evesham. 
 (the Vegetable Garden of England)     
   The land use is predominantly for   
{farming,}especially cereal crops and  
 pasture.Other{influences,}however,    
 include the Royal Engineer{army base  
 at Long Marston Depot, the tourist    
 centre of Stratford upon Avon, and the
 semi-redundant{airfield ,Long Marston.
   Local housing is mixed council,     
 services, private, modern &amp; historic. 
   A small number of indigenous        
 villagers has been added to greatly by
 these and other influences and so the 
{population is very mixed,}including a 
 large number of service families.     </content>
