		<title>16Recreation &amp; Tourism</title>
		<content> Recreation is limited to walking and  
 fishing which in turn are tourist     
 attractions. The summer sees tourists 
 in the area for the beautiful scenery 
 and peace. In a minor way cycling and 
 horse riding take place. Local        
 footpaths have been signposted by the 
 Council to encourage walking. An old  
 flour mill &amp; bakery has been          
 renovated &amp; is an attraction as a     
 restaurant. Some people follow        
 recreational pursuits out of the area.
 There are darts &amp; pool teams at local 
 pubs. Gliding is taught on the old    
 airfield at Strubby which is also a   
 heliport. Kart racing also takes      
 place. The caravan park at Woodthorpe 
 provides a 9 hole golf course,        
 fishing, bowling &amp; swimming in an open
 air pool. There aare sometimes artists
 in this area painting in both oil and 
 watercolour.                          </content>
