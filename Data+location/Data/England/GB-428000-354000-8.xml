		<content> I woke up on Monday morning at 4      
 25am. It was light  outside and my    
 quilt had fallen off my bed. I pulled 
 it back on and there lying on the     
 floor were three{presents.}"Great" I  
 thought and a card extra big. I       
 decided I should leave it till the    
 proper morning about 8 00am. But some 
 how I could'nt. I went into my mum's  
 bedroom and I took my{presents}with   
 me. I put them down on the bed and    
 woke my mum up. She said I could open 
 them in my room so I went to my room  
 and opened them. There were some      
 sandals and a{little pony purse. My   
{best present}came five days later a   
 Raleigh{bike}mauve with three  gears. 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
