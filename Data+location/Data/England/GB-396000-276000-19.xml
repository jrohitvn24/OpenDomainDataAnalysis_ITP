		<title>19Transport in Rubery</title>
		<content>      Most homes in Rubery have a car. 
 In a school survey 71% of pupils      
 parents have a car which they use     
 regularly. This is not surprising     
 since a lot of the parents of the     
 children at this school in fact work  
 at the nearby Austin Rover Plant      
 building the Metro car.               
     Cars then are the predominant form
 of private transport, hence the       
 village of Rubery being bounded on the
 one side by the M5 Motorway, and      
 indeed a dual carriageway going       
 straight through the middle of the    
 village.                              
     There is no direct railway station
 which serves Rubery village, the      
 nearest being  at Bromsgrove or at    
 Longbridge. The area is however well  
 served by regular bus services which  
 go to nearby Bromsgrove and           
 Birmingham.                           </content>
