		<content> A major tourist attraction at Old     
 Warden is the Swiss Garden.It was     
 built in 1832 and completed by 1834 by
 Lord Ongley.In 1796 before becoming a 
 multi_millionaire,he was a train      
 builder.He later bought 9 acres of    
 land.Lord Ongley was born on 3rd      
 October 1771 and owned what is now the
 Shuttleworth estates.                 
 The legend is that Lord Ongley had    
 a Swiss girlfriend, and he built the  
 garden for her which included a Swiss 
 cottage.Another legend  is that Lord  
 Ongley's Swiss girlfriend had a       
 son who died of pneumonia aged 9.Lord 
 Ongley was so shocked that he built a 
 marble slab under an oak tree which   
 included a marble book that had a poem
 written in it.The boy is buried nearby
 where a cross marks his grave.The     
 Swiss Garden is now open to visitors  
 with 750_800 people each week.        </content>
