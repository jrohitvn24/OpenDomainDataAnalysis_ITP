		<title>09Changing Times In Garston</title>
		<content>   I can remember that where there is  
 new Iceland Frozen Food Centre on     
 Speke Road once was a Woolworth Store.
 They have now completed a new{By-pass}
 which has done a great deal to make   
 Garston quieter. Where the old        
 Lennon's{Store}used to be on Speke    
 Road they have opened a new Woolton   
 Carpet Centre. Workmen are also       
 putting in a{new clock}in St.         
 Michael's Church tower whilst others  
 are building a{new Sports Centre}on   
 Garston Park. Lennon's new Store has  
 already been taken over by Gateway    
 Foodmarkets. There used to be a Public
 House called Mona's Castle at the     
 junction of St. Mary's Road and Speke 
 Road. It has now been demolished and  
 some benches and litter bins have been
 put there. Some billboards have been  
 erected and a small area has been     
 grassed over.    ANDREW MACOY (9)     </content>
