		<title>17SEATS ON THE FORESHORE</title>
		<content> A project that{Pagham Parish Council} 
 has been very busy with lately, is the
 purchase of an area of foreshore      
 adjacent to the Pagham Yacht Club, to 
 enable a concrete footpath, leading to
 a hard standing, to be constructed on 
 the foreshore.  A number of seats will
 be built on this hard standing.       
                                       
 It will then be possible for the      
 elderly and infirm, including people  
 in wheelchairs, to gain access to the 
 foreshore and to be able to enjoy the 
 amenity of the beach the same as other
 people.   This will mean that the     
 council will have been able to provide
 such seating at each end of the parish
 foreshore; it was able to do the same,
 early in 1980, at the beach between   
 Viscount Drive and Channel View.
