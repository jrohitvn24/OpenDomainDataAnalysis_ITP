		<title>03Life of a Wroxall farmer.</title>
		<content>  My grandad is a farmer. He has a 110 
 acres, with 58 cows and 42 heifers, 40
 are Friesians and 18 Ayrshires. He    
 rears his own calves and they come    
 into the stable when they are about 2 
 and a half years old.He milks the cows
 at six o'clock in the morning and at 3
 o'clock in the afternoon.Most days 2  
 ladies do the milk round from 9 a.m.  
 to 12 a.m. He employs a girl to wash  
 the milk bottles in the morning.      
  Grandad does the hay making as soon  
 as the weather looks settled in June. 
  He has worked and then farmed for 46 
 years.He says the biggest changes are 
 that now he has milking machines and  
 farmers keep more cows than they did. 
 They use fertilizer on the grass to   
 make it grow more to feed the extra   
 cows. He also used to use horses where
 as now he has tractors.
