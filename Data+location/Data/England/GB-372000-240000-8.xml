		<title>08A District Nurse's Daily Lot</title>
		<content>  The day begins at 8am. with a series 
 of phone calls. Today the first is    
 from a colleague requesting visits    
 to her patients on her day off. A call
 from a relative asking me to call on  
 her sick husband. Equipment gathered, 
 and the answerphone switched on, away 
 at 8.30am. First to a paralysed lady  
 needing much nursing care; next onto  
 another lady to re-dress her ulcerated
 leg .Next the surgery, discussing     
 patients' needs, and to collect some  
 dressings. Then a call to give an iron
 injection, on again to remove post-   
 operative sutures, another injection; 
 help with a bath, more post-operative 
 dressing, followed by reassuring a    
 worried relative. After more calls,   
 home to any recorded messages, writing
 up patients' notes, and phone calls to
 doctors etc.Finally equipment and     
 'black bag' are sorted for tomorrow.  </content>
