		<title>12The Residents of Brownsea.</title>
		<content> There are thirty inhabitants  on      
 Brownsea and they have lived there for
 periods varying from twenty-five years
 to two days.Most of them love it there
 and would not like to leave,but a     
 minority would.One man moved to the   
 island because of his job,left it,and 
 has now been glad to return.Of the    
 thirty inhabitants,twenty-two are     
 permanent residents and the others    
 live there in the summer only.One     
 person was there when the island was  
 first opened to the public by the     
 National Trust.It used to be very     
 overgrown then, so it has changed very
 much.                                 
 There is a chief warden,who is in     
 charge of the whole island,and a      
 warden who is in charge of the nature 
 reserve.The cafe owner has lived on   
 the island for three years and there  
 are shopkeepers,guides &amp; receptionists</content>
