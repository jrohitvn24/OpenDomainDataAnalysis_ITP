		<title>04THE FARMER</title>
		<content> The farmer has been at Weeley Lodge   
 Farm since 1942. He started off with  
 180 acres &amp; it has gradually grown to 
 480 acres over the years. To look     
 after all this, he only employs two   
 young lads on his farm to operate all 
 the machines.                         
 He grows mainly cereals with peas as a
 break crop. There are 2 sorts of wheat
 &amp; 3 of barley. He rotates crops       
 anticlockwise so the peas don't come  
 round any more than every 5 years. The
 farmers try to help each other because
 his neighbours swap their farmyard    
 manure for his straw which he brings  
 back by trailer to his farm.          
 One thing that concerns him is that   
 the increase in wheat grown over the  
 last 8 years has risen from 15 to 24  
 millon tons. There is a wheat mountain
 building up &amp; there are not enough    
 people to eat it all.                 </content>
