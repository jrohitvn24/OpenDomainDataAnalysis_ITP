 many shopping facilities. There is the
{Market Place, Haymarket Centre}and the
{Department Stores}eg{Co-op, Marks &amp;   
{Spencers}and{Lewis's.                 
 The Haymarket Centre is particularly  
 important as it offers indoor shopping
 facilities incorporating many well    
 established stores such as{C&amp;A, BHS,  
{Littlewoods}and{International.}There  
 are also shops not so well known      
 nationally eg{All Kinds}and{Zodiac.}  
 Inside the Haymarket there are stairs,
 escalators and lifts linking the two  
 floors to a roof car park. Seating    
 facilities are provided along with    
 cafes and restaurants. The presence of
{Security Guards}ensures a pleasant    
 atmosphere by curbing vandalism and
