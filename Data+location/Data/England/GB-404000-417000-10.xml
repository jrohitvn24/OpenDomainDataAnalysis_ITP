		<title>10RURAL AREAS OF STAINLAND</title>
		<content>      {Withens End}and{Ringstone Edge} 
 are on the hill top and are mainly    
 covered by moorland. There is only    
 one house and nine farms in the whole 
 area. At{Withens End}there is a       
 working quarry, called Clock Face     
 Quarry. At{Ringstone Edge}the only    
 things of interest are the reservoir,a
 gliding club and an old Cairn Circle. 
      Another area which is very lonely
 is{Scammonden Road. }Here the only    
 noise comes from the motorway which   
 can be seen in the distance. The      
 fields are used for cattle and horses.
 There are only a few houses and these 
 are old and built from stone.         
   {Marsden Gate}is on a hill top.You  
 can see all the way to Wakefield from 
 here.A new radio mast has been built  
 here for Pennine Radio.It covers the  
 Yorkshire area. The M62 passes through
 this area.                            </content>
