		<title>19SHOPPING IN THE COUNTRYSIDE</title>
		<content> Shopping in the country is very expen-
 sive because the shops are smaller and
 have to charge more.That is why most  
 people do their bulk shopping in      
 towns.There are three shops in our    
 village which sell food and odds and  
 ends but mainly we go to the nearby   
 towns.The most popular town is Persh- 
 ore,then Tewkesbury, then Cheltenham. 
 Most people go to more than one town. 
 Usually we go in a car so we can take 
 the shopping home easily, anyway we do
 not have much of a bus service.Some of
 the large supermarkets are just out-  
 side towns so that parking is much    
 easier.The most popular shopping day  
 is Saturday.In our class most people  
 go shopping with the whole family     
 together.Sometimes we have to go far- 
 ther away to get larger things but we 
 don't go too far.Most people from our 
 class go to the village shops alone.  </content>
