		<title>16Cleeve Abbey</title>
		<content>      This beautiful old builiding in  
 its truly lovely setting is a well    
 known{tourist attraction.  }This is   
 how it is described in the local      
 guide.                                
      "Washford is the place from which
 to visit the splendid remains of      
 Cleeve Abbey, the only{Cistercian    }
 foundation in Somerset, and once the  
 most flourishing monastery in the     
 county.   Today, under the            
 guardianship of the{Department of the 
{Environment,}this treasure in stone is
 carefully preserved, though at one    
 time it housed cattle and farm        
 implements.   There are marvellously  
 preserved cloisters, refectory,       
 chapter-house and common room."       
     {The grounds of this Abbey provide
{the venue for the local First Schools 
{Festival of Country Dancing.          
                                       </content>
