		<title>16TRANSPORT AROUND BYFIELD</title>
		<content>MOST PEOPLE IN OUR AREA USE CARS AS    
TRANSPORT ALTHOUGH SOME OCCASIONALLY   
USE PUBLIC TRANSPORT AND SOMETIMES RIDE
OR WALK.PUBLIC TRANSPORT IN BYFIELD IS 
VERY INEFFICIENT AND SOME PEOPLE DON'T 
LIKE IT BECAUSE OF THE CIGARETTE SMOKE.
IMPROVEMENT FOR THE MAIN ROAD IS VERY  
POPULAR AND  ONLY ONE PERSON THAT WE   
ASKED SAID IT DID NOT NEED IT.FINALLY, 
WE FOUND THAT MOST PEOPLE IN OUR AREA  
TRAVEL TO DAVENTRY.IN THE PARISH OF    
BODDINGTON THEY HAVE NO PUBLIC         
TRANSPORT.THEY HAVE A BUS SERVICE FOR  
SCHOOLCHILDREN BUT OTHERWISE THE PEOPLE
USE CARS OR BICYCLES AS TRANSPORT.
