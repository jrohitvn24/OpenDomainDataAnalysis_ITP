{The school is over 160 years old .}It 
 could have been a barn because the    
 roof is very  high so wheat could have
 stored in it. The windows are high and
 there are bricked in parts that could 
 have been doors high in the walls for 
 the wheat to be loaded into the barn. 
{On the 26 of July 1921 the Corbets    
{sold the school to the churchwardens  
{of the parish of Childs Ercall in the 
{county of Salop.}Class  one is made of
 wood it is a demountable building and 
 was built about tewnty years ago when 
 there were 100 children in the school 
 but there are only 35 now.The number  
 of children dropped there are now 22  
 infants and 13 juniors but there are  
 many babys being  born in the village 
 so we hope the number of childen in   
 school will go up over the next few   
 years.                                </content>
