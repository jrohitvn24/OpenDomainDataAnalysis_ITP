		<title>13EMPLOYMENT IN BIRCH</title>
		<content>  In a survey which we conducted in    
 school we found that most fathers     
{worked}in Colchester because it is    
 fairly close to Birch and there is a  
 bus service into town. The fathers who
 work in Birch work  on the{farms.     
 Several parents work for local        
 building firms and at the sand pits in
 Stanway. Some small firms use the out 
 buildings near Birch Hall. 12 fathers 
 travelled more than 26k from Birch,   
 some{commute}to London by train       
 although some drive there. A{shopping 
 centre has opened in Stanway.         
  Over half the mothers worked, some   
 part time. Most work locally so that  
 they can be at home when their        
 children come back from school. Many  
 have no{transport}and the bus service 
 is infrequent. A lot of mothers worked
 at home or in other peoples' houses in
 and around Birch.                     </content>
