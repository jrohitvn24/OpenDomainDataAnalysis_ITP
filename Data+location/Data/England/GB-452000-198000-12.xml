person in goal and 2 on the pitch, if  
the ball goes outside the 18 yard area 
one of the 2 people on pitch may take  
a shot .If it gets past the person in  
goal it will be a point to the people  
on the pitch.If the person in goal     
catches the ball without it touching   
the ground it will be a point to the   
person in the goal.Inside the 18 yard  
area you can only score points with a  
header or a volley.The first person to 
10 points wins.

person is Â£it'; first he has to count  
to a hundred while all the others
