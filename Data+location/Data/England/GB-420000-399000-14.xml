		<title>14Hunshelf's future?</title>
		<content>  Although this is a small rural area, 
 there is a considerable amount of new 
 development planned.A new water system
 is "in the pipeline" and there is to  
 be a new television mast to improve   
 reception of Channel 4,although public
 opinion is generally that reception is
 good enough already.                  
  The Council intend to resurface roads
 and improve pavements,and there is a  
 plan to set up a picnic area for      
 weekend motorists.A new housing estate
 is on the drawing board.Probably the  
 biggest project for the future is the 
 building of the Stocksbridge by-pass. 
  The face of Hunshelf seems set to    
 change soon.Will it be entirely a     
 change for the better-or will the     
 alterations destroy the character and 
 landscape of Hunshelf?
