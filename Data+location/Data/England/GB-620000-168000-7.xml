		<content>We play in the bushes and we found an  
old carpet to make it really           
comfortable.One day we found a linnet's
nest and quite near to it a chaffinch's
nest.As lunchtime approaches we make   
our way home for lunch.Usually we have 
a hamburger in a roll and maybe        
chips.If the weather is sunny and warm 
we go to the beach after lunch.I'm     
quite a good swimmer and I like living 
near the sea.We often take a picnic    
with us to eat on the beach.Louise     
likes to look in the rock pools and we 
often find starfish stranded when the  
tide is out. There are many interesting
things to find on the beach.At about   
six o'clock we go back home and Louise 
usually leaves about eight o'clock.I   
might watch T.V. for a while until I go
to bed around nine.I always read a book
in bed until Mum comes to switch off   
the light.                             </content>
