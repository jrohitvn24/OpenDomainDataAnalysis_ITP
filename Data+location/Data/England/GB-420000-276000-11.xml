		<title>11Transport around Balsall (1)</title>
		<content> Balsall Common is situated between    
 Coventry, Birmingham, Redditch, and   
 Leamington Spa. Motorways including   
 the M1, M6, M5, and the proposed M40  
 surround Balsall Common on three sides
 none of them more than twenty miles   
 away.The A452 runs right through the  
 centre of the village so there is     
 easy access to any jobs elsewhere. It 
 also means that heavy snow in         
 Winter is quickly cleared from the    
 roads. But it also gives              
 disadvantages, for the heavy vehicles 
 disturb the foundations of buildings, 
 the lead in the air is quite a lot and
 the noise is terrible especially at   
 nights. Parking facilities are quite  
 good because there are spaces marked  
 outside the shops but unfortunatly    
 there are always a lot of delivery    
 vans parked outside them.There is also
 a car park opposite the station.      </content>
