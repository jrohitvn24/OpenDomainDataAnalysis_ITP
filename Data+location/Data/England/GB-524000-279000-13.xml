		<content> This area forms part of the North     
 Cambridgeshire constituency which has 
 historically been conservative, in    
 line with most of rural               
 Cambridgeshire.  Local government     
 services are provided by              
 Cambridgeshire County Council who are 
 responsible for road maintenance,     
 street lighting, library and education
 services and the emergency services,  
 and Huntingdonshire District Council, 
 which is the Housing, Planning and    
 Refuse collection authority.  The area
 covers part of 4 parish councils,     
 namely those of Upwood and the        
 Raveleys, Wistow, Kings Ripton and    
 Broughton.  A Parish Council is       
 responsible for providing and         
 maintaining play areas and public     
 lighting where it falls below the     
 highway standard required by the      
 Cambridgeshire County Council.        </content>
