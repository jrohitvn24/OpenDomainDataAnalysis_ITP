 area requires a smaller workforce in  
 1985 because it has become a highly   
 mechanised industry.The farmer and    
 his wife run the farm, larger farms   
 employing one full-time agricultural  
 worker. School leavers do not find    
 opporunities in farming unless they   
 belong to a farming family.{West Hele 
{Rare Breeds Survival Trust}specialises
 in breeding rare breeds of pigs and in
 the farmshop sale of high quality pork
 products. The centre employs five     
 people Three ancilliary {part time    
{jobs}are found at the{school.}Three   
 part time{postmen}work locally. On the
 whole residents have to find work in  
 the nearby towns of{Chulmleigh, South 
{Molton}and{Barnstaple}.There are  a   
 few {self-employed}handy men and      
 recently a thatcher.
