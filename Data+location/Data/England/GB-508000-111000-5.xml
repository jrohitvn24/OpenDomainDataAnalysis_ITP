		<content> St. Joseph's Dominican Convent, The   
 Abbey, Storrington, is a small Roman  
 Catholic mixed boarding and day school
 for children aged three and a half    
 years to eleven years.  It was founded
 in 1953 by the Dominican Sisters in a 
 Tudor building at the foot of the     
 South Downs, formerly the home of the 
 Ravenscroft family.                   
 Windlesham House School, Highden,     
 Washington, is a mixed boarding school
 founded in 1837 in a Georgian building
 and has been under the control of the 
 Malden family throughout its          
 existence. The present Headmaster is  
 the great-great-grandson of the       
 founder.  The school was formed into a
 Charitable Trust called the Malden    
 Trust in 1963, and offers a wide range
 of activities for over three hundred  
 pupils in mixed classes.
