		<content>   Most people have cars because there 
 are only two buses a day and because  
 it is quick and quiet. There is one   
 main road called the{B4368.}The road  
 is fairly straight from{Clun}to{Little
{Brampton.}The most popular car makes  
 are{Ford}and{British Leyland.}The most
 popular car colours are metalic blue  
 and silver. Most people have medium   
 sized cars.                           
   There are lots of military jets and 
 Hercules (Big cargo planes) flying low
 in this area to practice flying under 
 the radar. People complainin a lot    
 about the disturbance. There is one   
 petrol station in{Aston-on-clun}and a 
 Mazda car show room next door. The    
{B4368}is the widest road and is coated
 in tarmac, as are most of the smaller 
 roads. Some of these are only single  
 track.                                
                                       </content>
