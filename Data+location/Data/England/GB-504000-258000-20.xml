		<title>20Road Verge Nature Reserves</title>
		<content> There are 14 road verges in the County
 of Bedfordshire that have been        
 designated as nature reserves, one of 
 which is in Thurleigh. The designation
 is due to the presence of flowers that
 are scarce in the countryside. The    
 reserves are managed to maintain their
 wildlife interest by the Community    
 Programme team, YouthTraining Scheme  
 and the Bedfordshire Conservation     
 Volunteers. The reserve has many      
 species of attractive and uncommon    
 plantsincluding, tall broomrape,      
 yellow rattle and bee orchids. This   
 year the scrub was removed to ensure  
 the continuous growth of these plants 
 and the verges have been marked with  
 new posts and signs so that people    
 will know where they are.
