		<content>   We talked to pensioners who attended
 the Luncheon Club each Wednesday.     
 They were appreciative of the service 
 as it allowed them to buy a good meal 
 at a low cost and make many new       
 friends. We also visited the Playgroup
 which caters for children aged 2-5 and
 about 25 children attend each day.    
 They enjoy various pre-school learning
 activities and playing on slides and  
 climbing frames.                      
                                       
   Future plans for the Centre are to  
 improve the present services and to   
 help those in the Community who cannot
 easily get to the Centre at present. A
 shopping service for the infirm and   
 disabled has already been initiated   
 and a handyman and hairdressing       
 service will start soon. The first    
 edition of their magazine was         
 published in June l985.               </content>
