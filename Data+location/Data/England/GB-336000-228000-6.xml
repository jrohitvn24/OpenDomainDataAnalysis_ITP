		<title>06RIVER DORE AND DULAS BROOK</title>
		<content> The{ River Dore}gets its name from    
 "dwr", the{Welsh}word for water. When 
 the{Normans}came they thought the     
 locals were saying " d'or" meaning    
 golden so it became Dore and the area 
 is now called the{Golden Valley.}It   
 flows through{Abbey Dore}to{Pontrilas 
 where it joins  the{River Monnow.}It  
 provides water for the sheep and      
 cattle grazing along its banks and    
 sometimes floods, making the land     
 rich. Some of the trees along the     
 banks are being cleared to make the   
 river faster and deeper.{Dulas Brook  
 runs from{Dulas}through{Ewyas Harold  
 to{Pontrilas}where it joins the{Dore  
 and the{Monnow.}It is usually not deep
 enough to row a boat down but there   
 are pools deep enough to swim in.     
 After heavy rain it quickly rises and 
 becomes deep and fast enough to knock 
 a child off its feet.                 </content>
