		<content> The original part of the village      
 mainly consists of stone built houses 
 which front directly on to the        
 pavement.Until recently these were    
 owned by the Leadenham Estate,but a   
 number of these have now been sold    
 off.Many of the old cottages have been
 modernised but have retained their    
 character and thick stone walls.As the
 village lies in a conservation area   
 there are restrictions on the         
 alterations which can be made to the  
 buildings and to the walls.Recently,  
 development has taken place towards   
 the north end of the village with,    
 around 1963, the building of the      
 bungalows in Queensway and the houses 
 in North Road.During the last few     
 years,the development called Waterloo 
 Paddock has been completed.These are  
 modern houses,brick built,set back    
 from the road,each having a garage.   </content>
