		<title>10Green Belt Festival</title>
		<content> Up until 1984 the famous Green Belt   
 Festival was held in the field        
 adjacent to Odell Great Wood. Thiswas 
 an annual event that lasted over the  
 Bank Holiday Weekend.It was a         
 Christian Festival with a difference. 
 It is open for all ages, but mainly   
 tended to attract the young teenage   
 people. Readings and songs of a       
 religous nature took place, but with a
 young flavour. The instruments used to
 accompany the singing were guitars and
 drums, which are more readily linked  
 with rock and roll, than hymn singing.
 People going to the festival camped   
 over the holiday and used to bring    
 great activity to an area that is not 
 inhabited by many people. One year    
 Cliff Richard was at the Festival. The
 celebration has now grown so large in 
 popularity that it has moved to a     
 larger site in Northamptonshire.      </content>
