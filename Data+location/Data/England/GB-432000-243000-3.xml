		<title>03ATTITUDES IN TYSOE - 1</title>
		<content> The general attitude of people living 
 in Tysoe in 1985 seems to focus on    
 awareness of our society as being     
 materialistic, reflected in factors   
 such as wishing to be better off, to  
 acquire more possessions, with self   
 coming before the community. There is 
 also a tendency to live for the       
 present without due regard for the    
 future, believing that the future is  
 something which those living in the   
 present need make no preparation for. 
 However, the fact that there is       
 concern both over the high level of   
 unemployment which exists now and over
 the threat of nuclear war, suggests   
 that the 'living for today' attitude  
 is not totally prevalent. There is a  
 belief that the future to some extent 
 depends on actions of the present.
