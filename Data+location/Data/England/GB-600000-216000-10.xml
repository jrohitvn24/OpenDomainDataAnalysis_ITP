		<title>10LANGENHOE PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Our{school}is 106 years old and it was
 damaged in the{Essex Earthquake}of    
{1884.}It needed tie rods on the walls 
 to hold it together. In the winter of 
{1984}our roof was retiled. The workmen
 were to re-use as many of the old     
 tiles as possible and so removed them 
 very carefully. We found that as well 
 as{Victorian}tiles, some of them were 
{Tudor,}taken from a building which was
 pulled down about the time the school 
 was built. A local historian believes 
 they were made locally as there is    
 evidence that a kiln existed in       
 another part of the village.          
 The original school building had 2    
 classrooms. Nowadays we use one room  
 as a classroom, hall and canteen and  
 the other as a library, staff and T.V.
 room. As the pupil numbers have       
 increased, we now have 2 relocatable  
 classrooms in addition.               </content>
