		<content> Although R.A.F Molesworth is outside  
 our survey area,it has a great affect 
 on our villages,because of the        
 controversy  about siting Cruise      
 Missiles of the American Airforce     
 in this country.There is a lot of     
 protest from the C.N.D. movement and  
 other groups and peace camps were set 
 up.This has meant that there have been
 many more people in the               
 area,particularly Easter 1985 when    
 there was a demonstration of 5,000    
 people. There are a lot more police   
 about as well . many of the local     
 people do not like the campers being  
 here,but many people do.They have     
 mostly been moved on by the police    
 butmore demonstrations are planed for 
 the future.The Ministry of            
 Defence has erected a huge perimeter  
 fence at the base.The missiles are due
 to arrive in 1988.                    </content>
