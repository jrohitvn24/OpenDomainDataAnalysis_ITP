{Bishop Goodwin Junior School}is the   
 only Church of England school in      
 Carlisle. The present building has    
 been open since 1972 and before that  
 the school was on a site now occupied 
 by a supermarket.                     
      Our school is an open plan design
 in two units either side of a hall.   
 Each unit has four classes who share  
 the resources between them. Also on   
 the same campus is Bishop Goodwin     
 Infant School. Most of the present    
 fourth year have been to both schools.
 In 1985 Mr. D.J. Thomas retired after 
 being the Headteacher of the junior   
 school for eighteen years. The pupils 
 who left for secondary school         
 performed {"Joseph and his Amazing    
{Technicolour Dreamcoat"}a musical, by 
 Andrew LLoyd Webber and Tim Rice.
