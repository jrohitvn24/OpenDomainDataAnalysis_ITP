 The Cheshire Oak factory is in a      
 converted  cow shed in Burwardsley    
 which is rented from the Bolesworth   
 Estate. The two partners wanted to    
 start making furniture.They began  the
 business in March 1985. At the moment 
 they are making house furniture and   
 garden furniture and for Christmas    
 they are going to make toys. The woods
 they use are oak and mahogany and in  
 the shed are stacks of wood and       
 machinery.There is no smoking allowed 
 because there would be a risk of a    
 fire starting. My mum said, "I love   
 the wood and making things out of it."
 As  for the future they said that     
 people wanted quality furniture and   
 they could sell their furniture at    
 home and abroad. The shavings are too 
 hard for animal bedding, so far they  
 have not found a use for them. Simon. </content>
