		<title>15THE ROLE OF THE CHURCH 2</title>
		<content>  The vicar is also aware of the need  
 for his involvement in the secular    
 activities of village organisations.  
  There are normally three or four     
 services every Sunday;two or three in 
 Puddletown and one at St.Johns,       
 Tolpuddle.The family service is the   
 best attended.The congregations have  
 generally increased over the last ten 
 years.At the present there are 197    
 names on the parish role .There is    
 very little variation in the size of  
 the congregation throughout the year  
 although they are particulaly large at
 festival times.His other duties       
 involve attending weddings,funerals   
 and baptisms.
