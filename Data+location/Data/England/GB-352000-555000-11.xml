		<content>     The 12 farms in the study area    
 cover a total of 1985 acres.   The    
 size of farm ranges from 65 to 410    
 acres with an average of 165 acres.   
 Of this total, 482 acres were left as 
 permanent or rough pasture, 1185 acres
 were classified as improved pasture   
 and 278 acres as arable.              
     There were 1178 cows, the majority
 grazing on the flatter land in the    
 west of the area.   Sheep were mainly 
 located on the steeper, poorer quality
 land towards the east where one farm  
 owned 2325 of the 3614 total for the  
 area.   One farm had 12 horses.       
     The farms had a total of 30       
 tractors, but only 2 combines as most 
 of the limited amount of cereal       
 harvesting is done by contractors.    
 Nine farms had their own haymaking    
 equipment.                            
                                       </content>
