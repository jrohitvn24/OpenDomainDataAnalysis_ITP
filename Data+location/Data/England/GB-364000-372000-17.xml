		<content>   COMMUNICATIONS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN VERY
 IMPORTANT IN NORTHWICH.THE FACT THAT  
 IT WAS A GOOD POINT TO CROSS THE RIVER
 WEAVER ON THE WAY TO CHESTER AND COULD
 BE DEFENDED EASILY ARE THE REASONS THE
 TOWN GREW IN ROMAN TIMES.             
   IN MORE RECENT TIMES COMMUNICATIONS 
 BY ROAD CROSSED AT NORTHWICH (OVER THE
 RIVER WEAVER) MAKING THE AREA ONCE    
 AGAIN A MAJOR COMMUNICATION CENTRE.THE
 RIVER WAS WIDENED TO ALLOW FOR THE    
 PASSAGE OF CARGO VESSELS FROM THE SALT
 MINES AT WINSFORD.ALSO SWING BRIDGES  
 WERE ERECTED TO ALLOW ROAD AND RIVER  
 TRAFFIC TO MOVE FREELY.               
 MANY PEOPLE COMMUTE DAILY TO LIVERPOOL
 AND MANCHESTER AND IN A SMALL SURVEY  
 THAT WE CARRIED OUT,86% OF HOMES HAD  
 TELEPHONES,AND 92% HAD AT LEAST ONE   
 CAR.THESE FACTS SHOW THE INCREASING   
 IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNICATIONS IN THE   
 NORTHWICH BLOCK IN 1985.              </content>
