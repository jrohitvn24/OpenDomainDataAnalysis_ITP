		<title>08Employment in the Ufton Area</title>

  The pattern of employment has not    
changed significantly since an earlier 
enquirey by schoolchildren in 1969.    
  As in 1969 the main occupations of   
residents employed in the area are     
connected with farming. This does not  
apply to more than a dozen people,     
however,since the majority commute to  
employment in the larger towns of      
Coventry; Royal Leamington Spa and     
Warwick amongst others. The closure of 
the School and Petrol Station has      
further reduced the possibility of     
local employment since 1969.           
  Apart from agriculture some part-time
work is available at the local public  
house whilst the garage; boarding      
kennels and riding stables employ two  
or three others.
