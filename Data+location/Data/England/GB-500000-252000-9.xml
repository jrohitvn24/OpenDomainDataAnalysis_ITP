		<title>09Occupations in Clapham</title>
		<content> My dad is a policeman and works at the
 R.A.E. in Clapham and my mum works in 
 Kempston as a Health Visitor.   Nearly
 everybody has a job except for a few  
 unemployed people.   These are places 
 where some of them work Ampthill,     
 Bedford, Biggleswade, Cambridge,      
 Clapham, Harrold, Kempston, London,   
 Luton, abroad, travelling and many    
 more.   We have one factory up Green  
 Lane called M. and S. Packaging.      
 They make boxes and record sleeves.   
 Not many people work in Clapham       
 because it is small and there are not 
 very many jobs.   There are not many  
 shops because there isn't any room to 
 fit them in.   Twenty two grownups    
 work at Ursula Taylor School and they 
 have to look after about 14O          
 children.                             
                                       
                                       </content>
