   At the mill there are lots of sewing
 machines and they use them to sew the 
 kites and hobbyhorses.                
   They make about a hundred{kites}a   
 day and there are ten different kinds 
 of kites. They also make hobby        
 horses, wigwams, beach bags, bean     
 bags, and dog and cats beds.

 country.                              </content>
