		<title>01General Review NE Woking.</title>
		<content>  The area is traversed from south-west
 to north-east by the Portsmouth-London
 railway, the Basingstoke canal and the
 A320 road from Woking to Chertsey.It  
 consists of the north of Woking town, 
 the Sheerwater industrial estate and  
 parts of the villages of Woodham and  
 Pyrford. The north is mainly heathland
 common and wood, with small farms and 
 golf courses. The housing is varied   
 with expensive private property in the
 south and council houses and mixed    
 property around the edge of Woking    
 town. There is a NHS hospital as well 
 as a private hospital. Several large  
 properties have been converted into   
 homes for the elderly and small       
 private schools. The first mosque in  
 England, dating from 1889, is located 
 near the railway in the south and     
 forms the focus for a large Asian     
 community in the area.                </content>
