		<title>16A BUSY LIFE ON THE FARM</title>
		<content> MY BEST FRIEND HUGH MORRISON LIVES ON 
 A FARM.THE FARM IS NEAR THE AMESBURY  
 ROUNDABOUT. THE MAIN ANIMAL IS SHEEP. 
 AT THE MOMENT THEY HAVE ABOUT 500     
 SHEEP AND 1000 LAMBS.THE MAIN TIME OF 
 THE YEAR IS LAMBING,AT THIS TIME OF   
 THE YEAR MORE PEOPLE COME TO HELP.A   
 SHEEP USUALLY HAS TWO LAMBS. DURING   
 THE YEAR THEY ALSO SHEAR THE SHEEP 2-3
 TIMES.IN THE SUMMER THEY DIP THE SHEEP
 TO PREVENT MAGGOTS. LAST YEAR         
 MR.MORRISON BOUGHT A NEW CIRCULAR DIP 
 WHICH MAKES THE JOB EASIER. THEY ALSO 
 PRODUCE GRAIN SUCH AS WHEAT, BARLEY,  
 MAIZE AND OIL- SEED RAPE.             
 IN THE LATE SUMMER EVERYONE GOES INTO 
 THE FIELDS TO PICK THE WILD OATS,     
 THIS IS A LONG AND BORING JOB, BUT IT 
 MUST BE DONE. WHEN THE CORN IS RIPE   
 THEY GO ROUND WITH A COMBINE HARVESTER
 COLLECTING ALL THE GRAIN.
