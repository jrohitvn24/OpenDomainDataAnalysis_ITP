		<title>08BRAILES ANNUAL VILLAGE FETES</title>
		<content> There are two notable events in       
 Brailes.                              
   The first is St. George's Church    
 Fete, held on the Village Playing     
 Field in June. Gaily decked stalls,   
 competions, games and children's      
 sports are the main attractions.      
 Visiting entertainers usually provide 
 a special feature and afternoon teas  
 are served in the Village Hall.       
   In August the second and much larger
 event _ The Brailes Show _ takes      
 place. The day begins with a Horse    
 Show and Gymkhana. The Flower Show    
 Marquee opens in the afternoon,       
 together with various stalls, side_   
 shows, competitions, a dog show and   
 football to entertain the large       
 crowds. The Show attracts many        
 visitors and competitors from a wide  
 area.                                 
                                       </content>
