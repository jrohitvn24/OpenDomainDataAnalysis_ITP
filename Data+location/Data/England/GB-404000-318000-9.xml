		<title>09TEACHERS' DISPUTE, RUGELEY</title>
		<content> The national teachers' dispute in     
 1984/85 was caused mainly by a low pay
 offer following low pay rises in      
 recent years and by the proposed      
 inclusion of voluntary activities in  
 teachers' employment contracts. The   
 teachers take their own lessons but do
 not cover for absent colleagues; as a 
 result pupils have been sent home for 
 half a day 2-3 times a term. Teachers 
 do not supervise school meals or      
 breaks and leave the premises to avoid
 accepting responsibility for pupils'  
 activities. Many out of school clubs  
 and sports have ceased. The dispute is
 not total, younger pupils are little  
 affected and field trips are still    
 held. Teachers are losing respect,    
 some pupils have become militant and  
 have left classes. Dinner and break   
 supervision may soon resume in        
 anticipation of settlement.           </content>
