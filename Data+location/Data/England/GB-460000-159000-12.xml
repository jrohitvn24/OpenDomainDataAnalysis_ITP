		<content>  1985's argument in Tadley is a battle
 between the Southern Electricity Board
 and S.P.A.R.E.(Stop Pylons Across our 
 Rural Enviroment).The S.E.B. want to  
 put up pylons between Newbury and     
 Bramley passing through Tadley.Many   
 people have objected to this and      
 formed the group S.P.A.R.E.           
     The S.E.B. have to supply         
 electricity in the cheapest possible  
 way.                                  
     The background to the present     
 problem is that in 1974 it was        
 estimated by S.E.B. that Newbury would
 be needing more electricity at the    
 rate of 6% a year.This was to come    
 from Bramley Frith.Pylons were decided
 as the method and local land owners   
 were approached to sign wayleaves to  
 give permission for pylons to be put  
 on their land.Most agreed,some        
 objected.                             </content>
