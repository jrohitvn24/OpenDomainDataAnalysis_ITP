		<title>05FRECKLETON BY-PASS</title>
		<content> The village of Freckleton has been    
 involved in a battle for a            
 multi-million pound by-pass. The      
 residents feel they have been snubbed 
 in the campaign to have a route placed
 around the village. The village, which
 straddles the busy A584, had its dream
 three million pound scheme dropped in 
 1982 by the Labour County Council.    
 Councillor Rigby, one of the          
 Freckleton residents said, "The row   
 has been going on for nearly 30       
 years and still no solution has been  
 found. Not only has Freckleton to cope
 with the inconvenience caused by      
 aircraft noise, but also 6000 cars    
 crawl through its centre for 2 hours  
 every morning and evening". These are 
 the employees of the Warton Division  
 of British Aerospace. Heavy lorries   
 also use the road.
