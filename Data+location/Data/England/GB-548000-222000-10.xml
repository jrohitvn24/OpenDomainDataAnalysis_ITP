		<title>10We don't get bored!</title>
		<content> Our main source of entertainment is   
 watching television. Our favourite    
 programmes include films and cartoons.
 When we get bored with television we  
 like to go and play outside with our  
 friends.Some of us like to go to the  
 recreation ground where we play on the
 swings or play football and sometimes 
 we play 'hide and seek'.              
 When we are on our own some of us play
 records, read or sketch something.    
 Our{hobbies}include many things.Some  
 of us like to go to the local swimming
 pool especially in the summer months. 
 Many of the boys enjoy playing on     
 their BMX bikes and even some of the  
 girls do some scrambling.             
 At home we find many interesting      
 moments going through our collections 
 of various things like stamps,rubbers,
 key-rings and model-cars. Some of us  
 play games on our computers.          </content>
