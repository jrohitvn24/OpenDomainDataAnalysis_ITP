		<title>10THE FARMING YEAR</title>
		<content> The early part of the year is spent   
 feeding and tending the stock. Cattle 
 have silage, sheep have hay and all   
 the animals have concentrates as      
 supplementary feed. Lambing starts at 
 the end of March and continues until  
 early May. In May the cattle kept     
 indoors come out to grass. In June    
 silaging is done.  The making of      
 silage on a large scale has only been 
 introduced into the Dales during the  
 last ten years. Hay-making is in July.
 Sheep are sheared in June/July and    
 there are two compulsory dippings     
 before August. In August the lambs are
 weaned and in September and October   
 lambs are sold and new ewes are bought
 in. The local word for ram is "tup"   
 and for ewe "yow". In November and    
 December winter feeding begins        
 again.Milking is done daily on the    
 farm.                                 </content>
