		<content>   Our Domesday Project Area around the
 villages of Upper and Lower Bentley is
 mainly a{farming}one .The primary land
 cover in every kilometre square is    
 grassland,some used for actual grazing
 some cut for silage.Scattered around  
 the area are fields of crops,including
  cereals and vegetables,and deciduous 
 ofwoodland.The Thrift is the largest  
 area of trees,but this being chopped  
 down.Eventually this will be replaced.
   {Buildings}in the area are very     
 scattered.Apart from Upper and Lower  
 Bentley and Woodgate,which are small  
 communities with some residential     
 buildings,the remainder are twenty _  
 eight farms spread across the twelve  
 squares.Thus the region is not higly  
 populated. The only amenities in the  
 area are a{public house}and a small   
{garden centre}.
