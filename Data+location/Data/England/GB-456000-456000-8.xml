		<content>     When I woke up at 9.00am my mum   
 had already gone to work. I got up,   
 listened to the radio and got dressed 
 and washed.Then I went to the shop for
 my dad with Nicola my sister.We got   
 back at about 10.30am and watched the 
 end of a television film called       
 "Little Mo".                          
     We had lunch at 12.40pm.After that
 I played tennis outside.At 2.00pm. I  
 went to a badminton club at Clifton   
 Hospital.Badminton finished at 4.00pm 
 and when I returned home I played on  
 the computer.At 5.45pm. my dad went   
 for my mum at work.We had our tea at  
 6.30pm and I played on the computer   
 again.At 7.50pm. I watched            
 television.After that I played        
 "Connect 4" and "Guess Who" with      
 Nicola and then I got a drink and went
 to bed.
