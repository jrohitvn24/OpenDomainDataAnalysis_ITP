		<title>03THE STROUDWATER CANAL.</title>
		<content>      The Stroudwater Canal ran just   
 south of the A419.It joined the River 
 Severn to Stroud.The canal was        
 completed in 1779 and was built to    
 bring coal to Stroud from Shropshire, 
 Staffordshire and the Forest of Dean  
 for use in the woollen industry.It was
 about 9 miles long.The last barge came
 to the gas works,just to the east of  
 our area,in 1941.After that it became 
 silted up because of lack of use.In   
 1954 parts of the Canal were sold and 
 filled in by the local Council.       
      We interviewed Mr.R.Nott,        
 secretary to the Stroudwater          
 Navigation Company,which still owns   
 most of the canal.He is also involved 
 with the Canal Trust which was formed 
 in 1972 and is restoring the canal    
 with the permission of the Canal      
 Company.
