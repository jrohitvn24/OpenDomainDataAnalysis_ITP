		<title>10Completion of Lavant School</title>
		<content> In 1972 a new school was built in Mid 
 Lavant because the original school    
 built in 1855 was too small.Plans were
 drawn for the whole school to be      
 built, but because of cutbacks in     
 school building only part of the new  
 school was built. The goverment built 
 extensions to a lot of schools in West
 Sussex, in the same order as the      
 initial building. The new extension   
 building actually started. The new    
 extension was put off for many        
 years. Then in June 1984 the building 
 actually started. The new extension   
 consists of two classrooms, clockrooms
 a hall and library. Everyone in school
 watched the building grow for a year. 
 Then on June 3rd 1985 the extension   
 was finished and Lavant School became 
 one school once more.
