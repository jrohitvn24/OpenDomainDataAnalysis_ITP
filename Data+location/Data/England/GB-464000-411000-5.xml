		<content> A survey of a sample of the different 
 types of dwelling houses showed the   
 following approximate proportions.    
 Detached,1/8; Semi-detached,1/2;      
 Terraced,1/4; Bungalow or other, 1/8. 
 More than half the properties are     
 owner-occupied. About one-tenth of    
 houses date back to the turn of the   
 Century, but most of the building     
 developments occurred in the years    
 following the end of the two World    
 Wars.Nearly half of all the properties
 were built after World War Two.Over 90
 % of all buildings are brick-built. It
 is normal to find dwelling houses with
 both front and rear gardens.
