		<content> We came to the gateway by the motorway
 (B4) and saw ahead of us an arching   
 tunnelway of trees.We saw Chestnuts,  
 Oak,Silver-Birch and Beech trees. A   
 foot path led us through fields of    
 wheat and barley into a small wood.In 
 the field were electricity Pylons .In 
 front of us was the farm house in     
 Maidenbower Farm. All around us were  
 wild flowers-cowparsley,honeysuckle,  
 blue-bells,priwinkle,bird's foot, and 
 wood sorrel.There were buttercups,    
 daisies,thistles, dandelions, clover  
 and nettles. we saw lots of insects   
 too moths, caterpillars,butterflies,  
 ladybirds,horseflies,hover flies and  
 daddy long legs.On our way home we    
 heard a black bird singing in the     
 distance and we saw a robin in a tree.
 A flock of starlings flew over our    
 head as we got in the mini-bus to go  
 home.                                 </content>
