		<title>01BERRINGTON  "D"   BLOCK</title>
		<content> This is a{rural area,}based upon the  
{Parish of Berrington,}3 miles from the
 County town of{Shrewsbury.}Berrington 
 village has only 12 houses and most of
 the people live on the{Cross Houses   
 post war Council Estate. Recently some
 of these have been purchased by the   
 tenants. Berrington is 1 mile off the 
 main road at Cross Houses and still   
 has the Church, the School and the    
 Parish Hall. Both Berrington Post     
 Office and Shop closed in the 70's and
 are now at Cross Houses. The physical 
 separation between the original centre
 based at Berrington and the newer,    
 larger centre at Cross Houses gives   
 rise to some feelings of difference.  
{Brompton}hamlet is between Cross      
 Houses and the{River Severn.          
 Little recent development in the area 
 has increased the problems associated 
 with rural depopulation.              </content>
