 with a few small areas given over to  
 grazing. 3 farms keep beef cattle &amp; 3 
 keep sheep. One farm rears turkeys for
 the meat trade, and another rears and 
 releases game birds for shooting. The 
 largest farm consists of 730 acres of 
 arable land and was once 3 farms. At  
 one farm 83 acres of grass have been  
 sown and at another a small           
 experimental crop of borage has been  
 grown for vegetable oil and found to  
 be successful; but the main crops gown
 are; wheat, barley, peas, beans, oil  
 seed rape and potatoes. Artichokes are
 also grown for seed and as game bird  
 cover. The farm buildings are         
 generally well maintained, both for
