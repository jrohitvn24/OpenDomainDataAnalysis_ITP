		<title>10Farm houses</title>
		<content>                                       
 Most of the farm houses in this area  
 are made of bricks.They were easily   
 available from the brickworks in the  
 area.The exceptions are the more      
 substantial old houses like Manor     
 Farm, built around 1820, and Raskelf  
 Farm.Quite a lot of recent building   
 has taken place again mainly in brick.
 This is either where the farmer has   
 demolished the old buildings and had a
 bungalow built, as at Lund Farms, or  
 where a new market garden has been set
 up,as at Three Gables.Signs of        
 prosperity are the number of modern   
 extensions to existing property:      
 double garages,rooms designated       
 'computer rooms' and ponies in the    
 fields for children.Farm houses       
 predominate in the area with even the 
 main street in Raskelf having four,   
 together with groups of Farm cottages.</content>
