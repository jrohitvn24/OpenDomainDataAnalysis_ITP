		<title>13The village schools.</title>
		<content>   Both Melling and Arkholme have their
 own C.E.Primary school. They are both 
old schools. Melling has had extra     
classrooms and a kitchen built within  
the last 20 years. Numbers of children 
in Melling have dropped in recent years
from 70+ to 30 with 2 teachers&lt;19 boys-
11 girls>. Arkholme has 3 teachers for 
58 pupils in small rooms. Dinners are  
provided in both schools by their own  
cooks. A mini- bus brings children to  
Melling from 4 other villages and hill 
farms. Both schools have weekly swim-  
ming lessons at Hornby baths and an    
evening club. Parents come in to help  
with the craft,music, computer,and     
gardening. We take part in competitive 
sports with other small schools in the 
the Lune valley. For mutual help the   
staff of these schools  meet regularly 
and are setting up a pool of resources 
which the schools can all share.       </content>
