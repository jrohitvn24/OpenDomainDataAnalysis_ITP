		<title>10BUILDINGS IN THE AREA</title>
		<content> This block is particularly interesting
 because it is made up of 3 contrasting
 areas. Firstly there is{MARPLE,}a town
 of great variety of housing and shops 
 dating mainly from Victorian times    
 with several recent housing           
 developments.                         
 Secondly there is the more village    
 type atmosphere of{MARPLE BRIDGE}with 
 200 year old stone built property at  
 its centre and one main shopping      
 street. This too, is now surrounded by
 much modern housing.                  
 Thirdly moving out into the green belt
 area of{MELLOR}the balance between the
 old stone property and the newer      
 houses is much more even. There are no
 estate type developments and very few 
 shops, but there is a large farming   
 community. The oldest building in the 
 whole district is{MELLOR CHURCH.
