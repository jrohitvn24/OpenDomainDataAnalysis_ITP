 Parish, formed in 1979, consisting of 
 eight widely scattered hamlets lying  
 mainly on high ground on the north    
 west boundary of the New Forest,      
 dropping to farmland in the Avon      
 valley to the west and sloping away to
 a wide vista of open heathland to the 
 east.                                 
 The centre of parish life is at Hyde  
 with its church built in 1954, chapel,
 the primary school, the cricket club  
 and the village hall.The population   
 of about 1000 people comprises some   
 New Forest families of longstanding,  
 forests commoners and those working on
 traditional small holdings and in     
 recent years others who have retired  
 into the area or younger people who   
 work in neighbouring towns. Originally
 the houses were of cob and thatch  or 
 brick and tile, more modern houses    </content>
