		<content>   In Britain there is a National      
 Health System{(NHS)}which provides a  
 subsidised medical service for every_ 
 one.This system runs on a percentage  
 of tax,which the common tax_payer     
 contributes.Treatment,e.g.dental,and  
 prescriptions are paid for by the NHS 
 until the person reaches 18.Norwich is
 the Authority responsible for the     
 Southwold and Reydon area.

{GENERAL HEALTH.}                      
   There are three doctors responsible 
 for Southwold,who are available full  
 time.There is a local hospital in     
 Southwold that caters mainly for the  
 geriatric patients,but also has a     
 physio-therapy unit for out-patients  
 as well as residents.The hospital can 
 accommodate{17}patients.The patients  
 who need hospital care in the area go 
 to the two nearest hospitals.         </content>
