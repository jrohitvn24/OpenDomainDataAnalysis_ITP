station,it broadcasts to Banbury,      
Basingstoke,Cirencester and Swindon.It 
was opened on the 29th of October      
1970.It is small as it only three      
studios in Summertown and one in Walton
street.                                
  They employ forty-two people, twelve 
of them are the presenters.            
  They do all sorts of programs:sport  
,music ,travel and news.They also      
record requests.This is how it         
works:when you press a white button it 
records your message.(This is used     
frequently).They broadcast twelve hours
a day and use a hundred miles of  tape.
  We did a survey to see how many      
parents listen to it:out of twenty-five
 eleven listen in the morning this     
means 44% listen to it.                
  Radio Oxford has good sports coverage
and good coverage of events.           </content>
