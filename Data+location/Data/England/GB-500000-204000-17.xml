		<content>{LOCAL TRADE. }                        
 The hotel is used by local people     
 mainly at the weekends for dinner     
 dances,private parties,Sunday lunch   
 and wedding receptions.There are about
 16 or 17 of the latter in the Summer. 
 In addition local societies such as   
 the Round Table and the Lions have    
 meetings there in the evenings.       
 There are three pubs in Bourne End,two
 on the A.41 and one by the canal.All  
 are old buildings and attract custom  
 because they are picturesque.         
 The publicans described their         
 businesses as 'fair weather trade'that
 is people flock to them in Summer but 
 otherwise they rely more on passing   
 trade and the  business man's lunches.
 Nowadays pubs provide attraction other
 than food and drink.The past year has 
 included disco's,scalectrix display,  
 Beaujolais run,New Year fancy dress.  </content>
