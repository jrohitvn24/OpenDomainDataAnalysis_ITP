		<content> A Bridge Too Far For The R.A.F.       
                                       
 On the 15th February 1985 a large     
 lorry pulled up near our school with  
 two Police escorts. Then we heard a   
 loud chugging sound. We all rushed    
 outside and saw an R.A.F. Chinook     
 helicopter. The helicopter was to lift
 an 80ft beam into place at Fen Bridge 
 which was used by John Constable on   
 his way from East Bergholt to Dedham  
 Grammar School. The 80ft beam,        
 weighing 12 tons, had come from       
 Holland to Harwich on a cargo ship.   
 The R.A.F. tried four times to put the
 beam in place but it was impossible   
 because of the draught from the rotors
 of the helicopter. Now we are waiting 
 for them to bring a crane to do the   
 job.                                  
                                       
                                       </content>
