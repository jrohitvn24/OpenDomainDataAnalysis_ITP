		<content>    The block of 12 sq.kms. covered by 
 our study represents a generally flat,
 quiet, rural corner of Cambridgeshire-
 pleasant and safe for the children    
 yet, ironically, only 7 miles from the
 Nuclear Base at Molesworth.           
    It is an arable farming area, with 
 the main settlement being focussed    
 on the village of{Gt.Staughton,       
 (pop. circa 700)  situated on the main
 A45 from Northampton to Cambridge, and
 smaller settlements in the hamlet of  
{Dillington}and the southern outskirts 
 of{Perry.                             
    In Gt.Staughton there is a Parish  
 Church, Village Hall, a thriving      
 Primary School, a large Playing Field 
 and basic shops and amenities.        
    There is a wealth of clubs and     
 social activities, and a rich         
 community spirit is enjoyed.
