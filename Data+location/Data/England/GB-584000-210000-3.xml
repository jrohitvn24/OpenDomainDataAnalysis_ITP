      The United Reformed Church was   
 built by James Cottee in 1830 and     
 sold 25 years later to the            
 congregationalists. An increased      
 congregation necessitated the building
 of a new brick built church which was 
 opened in 1871. It became a U.R Church
 in 1972 when the Presbyterians and    
 congregationalists combined.          
                                       
      The present minister has been    
 here for 21 months and during that    
 time many alterations and improvements
 have been made to accomodate an       
 increasing congregations, the average 
 size of which is 40 adults and 25     
 children.
