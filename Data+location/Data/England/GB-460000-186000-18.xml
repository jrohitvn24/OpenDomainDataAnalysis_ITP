		<title>18TRANSPORT:WALLINGFORD BYPASS</title>
		<content>Traffic in Wallingford is its greatest 
problem.In a recent survey on the      
bridge a total of 302 vehicles passed  
in 30 minutes.220 cars,47 vans,29      
lorries and 6 busses.Juggernauts       
driving along the narrow high street   
are a source of danger,noise,damage and
pollution.Wallingford has long         
campaigned for a bypass and it appears 
that this will happen in the 1990s.    
The proposed bypass includes a new     
bridge over the Thames as well as road 
construction.The bridge would be just  
south of Carmel College.A bypass       
would obviously be of great benefet    
to Wallingford but there are objections
from loacal tradespeople               
,conservationists and residents who    
live near the route.
