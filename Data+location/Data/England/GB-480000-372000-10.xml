		<content> As would be expected, farming, chiefly
 arable is the main industry in this   
 sparcely populated rural community.   
 Various crops are grown including     
 cereals, rape, potatoes and other     
  vegetables and of couse the breeding 
 of livestock. However there are       
 several small businesses in this area 
 which are closely connected  to       
 agriculture. In Dunham on Trent and   
 Ragnall there is an Agricultural and  
 'Do it Yourself' supplier, two        
 agricultural merchants, a metalworker 
 and a builder and in Newton on Trent, 
 which is the larger village there is a
 potato merchant, a road haulier,a     
 timber merchant, a farm implement     
 manufacturer,and agricultural engineer
 and a tractor/car mechanic who        
 operates from premises once used by   
 the village blacksmith.
