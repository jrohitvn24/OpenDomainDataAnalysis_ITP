		<content>     IN THE SCHOOL YARD ONE OF THE     
 GOOD GAMES IS "COPS AND ROBBERS".     
 THERE ARE TWO TEAMS,ONE TEAM ARE      
 COPS AND THE OTHER TEAM ARE ROBBERS.  
 THE COPS LET THE ROBBERS GET AWAY     
 AND THEN CHASE THEM.IF THEY CATCH     
 THEM THEY PUT IN A PLACE THE WE'VE    
 DECIDE TO BE THE PRISON.IF ANOTHER    
 ROBBER TOUCHES A ROBBER IN PRISON     
 THE ROBBER CAN GET OUT OF PRISON.     
 THE COPS BECOME THE ROBBERS WHEN      
 THEY HAVE CAUGHT ALL THE ROBBERS.     
                                       
   ANOTHER GOOD GAME WE PLAY IS ROUND  
 ERS IN THE YARD WITHOUT A BAT.THE BA  
 TTING TEAM HIT THE BALL WITH THEIR    
 HANDS.THE FIELDERS THROW THE BALL     
 BACK TO THE BOWLER WHO STUMPS IT ON   
 THE BOWLERS CIRCLE AND THEN THE RUNNER
 IS OUT IF HE IS IN BETWEEN THE BASES. 
 THE TEAM THAT WINS IS THE TEAM THAT   
 HAS THE MOST ROUNDERS.                </content>
