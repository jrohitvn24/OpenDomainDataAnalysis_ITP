		<content>Station. The group prepared their      
questions carefully beforehand and     
recorded the answers on tape or in     
their reporters notebooks. All visits  
were reported to the class in an aural 
form and after discussion a written    
report was compiled. Information was   
collected through observation and      
questioning                            
Members of the community came into     
school or were interviewed at their    
workplace or home. Their cooperation   
was remarkable. All data was entered in
a data file.                           
Finally it was not until the following 
term that the pages for the Domesday   
Project were written. It proved an easy
task after so much first hand learning.
