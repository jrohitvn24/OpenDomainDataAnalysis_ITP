{The Early Purple Orchid}grow in       
 fertile soil in woods, meadows or     
 chalky grassland. They flower from    
 April to early June. We saw some when 
 we were walking though the woods, the 
 ones we saw were about 50 cm high and 
 they were light purple. There were    
 about six in a row near the path. They
 have long spikey leaves which grow    
 from the base, with purple blotches.  
 Orchids are quite rare in             
 Hertfordshire.
