		<content> One of the most popular children's    
 games is skipping.Two girls hold      
 the end of the rope while any amount  
 of girls queue up to skip.There are a 
 variety of rhymes to sing while       
 skipping. There is also French        
 skipping. Two girls who are end stand 
 opposite each other with a piece of   
 thick elastic around the backs of     
 their legs while the skippers jump    
 over the elastic from side to side    
 reciting the rhyme.A game which most  
 boys play is marbles.Each boy has a   
 separate amount.One of them throws a  
 marble,which both then try to hit.The 
 winner throws a marble and the whole  
 activity is repeated.Another game is  
 Bulldog.One boy is "on" while all the 
 other boys line up and one boy is     
 elected to run a certain distance not 
 being caught.If he succeeds all the   
 other boys do the same.               </content>
