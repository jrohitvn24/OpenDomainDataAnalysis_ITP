		<title>04The Village of Barston</title>
		<content> Barston is a small village.It has many
  old houses with beams to support     
 them. Some houses have sunk into the  
 ground making them crooked.The windows
 in the houses are very small and they 
 have criss cross patterns on them.They
 are called leaded windows.The village 
  has a village pump which is no longer
 in use.Beside the pump is a ruined old
 pound where they kept stray animals.  
 The farmers had to pay to get them    
 out. The village has a post office and
 general stores.The village has a small
 pub named the Bulls Head.There is a   
 house there called The School House.It
 may have been something to do with an 
 old school.There is no school there   
 now.
