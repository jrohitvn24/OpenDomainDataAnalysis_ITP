		<content>{Cheshire,}a leading dairy county, is  
 now seeing many changes.  Large       
 Friesian herds are interspersed with  
 increasing flocks of sheep.  The      
 changes comply with supply and demand 
 and meet E.E.C. regulations.  There is
 too much milk produced so farmers have
 become very specialised or turned to  
 mixed farming methods. {The Orchards,}
 a very successfuly farm, has been     
 voted Dairy Farm of the Year.         
 Grassland is widespread with potatoes 
 being produced to meet increasing     
 human demand.  An average of 3 workers
 per farm shows man's dependence on    
 modern machinery, the most valued     
 being the Herringbone Milking Parlour 
 and tractor.  The average farm        
 surveyed was 146 acres and the age,   
 135 years.  A recent trend shows farms
 being sold and the land divided into  
 bigger farms or for development.      </content>
