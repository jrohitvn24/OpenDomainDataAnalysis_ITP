		<title>17Singleton Church.</title>
		<content> The Church dates back to before 1000  
 A.D. It was owned by the great Earl of
 Godwine(who gave his name to Goodwood)
  ,father of King Harold.The present   
 church is mostly the same as it was in
 Saxon times,except for the            
 aisles,which were added later.The nave
 walls are Saxon.If you stand in the   
 central aisle,you can see the upper   
 window over the chancel arch which lit
 the room below the bell tower.This    
 window has still got the original     
 medieval glass in it.If you look      
 back,then you will see the Saxon      
 doorway. There are a number of tombs, 
 several of which are the tombs of     
 members of the Fitzalan family. The   
 Fitzalans were the Earls of Arundel.
