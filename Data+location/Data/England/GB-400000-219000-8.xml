   The puppies do not start hunting    
 until the September after their first 
 Christmas on the farms.When they come 
 back they put them on "couples"with   
 older hounds.The couple is a two piece
 of leather with a chain between.This  
 is to give the puppies education.     
   Out hunting the Master wears a red  
 jacket,white breeches and black riding
 boots.Children out hunting wear a     
 Tweed jacket,white breeches and black 
 riding boots.                         
   They start cub hunting as soon as   
 the corn is cut.They sometimes hunt on
 foot when the ground is too hard with 
 frost or covered with snow.
