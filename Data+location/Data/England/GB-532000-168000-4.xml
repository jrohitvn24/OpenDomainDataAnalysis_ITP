		<content>   The typical penge inhabitants view  
 of Crystal Palace National Recreation 
 Centre depends on his/her athleticism;
 for sporting types it is a godsend,   
 while for the not-so-energetic at     
 least the surrounding park, with its  
 zoo and lake, are fine for a pleasant 
 stroll.                               
   Sports Council research shows that  
 the 'regulars' who use their          
 facilities without being affiliated to
 any club, come from within a          
 three-mile radius (indicating that a  
 fair number of Penge inhabitants are  
 enthusiastic, if not extremely        
 athletic). Martial Arts are now one of
 the major participation sports...could
 this be a reflection on the public    
 reaction to street crime in the area?
