		<title>05TRADE: THE MARKET SQUARE</title>
		<content>{Potton Market Square}is an attractive 
 place for tourists. It is a small     
 town. There is one{bank.}I like Potton
 Market Square because of the old      
 buildings. In the square there are new
 flats called{Lions Court.}I would have
 liked Potton Market Square if the     
{Shambles}were there. The Shambles was 
 in the middle of the square and used  
 to contain a number of shops. It was  
 pulled down when the building became  
 unsafe and in a bad state of repair.  
  There are eight food shops and there 
 are fifteen non food shops. There is  
 one{Post Office}and there is a{library
 in the middle of the square. On the   
 Market Square there were many gardens 
 but now there are none. Altogether    
 there are 26 shops and there are four 
 roads leading into the square. There  
 are red bricks on the buildings.
