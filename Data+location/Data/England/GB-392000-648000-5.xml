 Horncliffe United Reform Church has   
 its origins in the Evangelical move_  
 ment in the Church of Scotland in the 
 early part of the nineteenth century. 
  Built in 1853,ten years after the    
 Disruption,as a congregation of the   
 Synod of the Presbyterian Church in   
 England,the preacher at its opening   
 service was thge hymn_writer, the Revd
 Horatius Bonar,at that time minister  
 of the Free Church of Scotland in     
 Kelso.                                
    The building, of local stone,was   
 erected to  replace the barn origin_  
 ally used by the congregation,and the 
 woodwork inside the building was the  
 work of the local carpenter.The manse 
 was first occupied in 1860,having cost
 Â£317 13s.to built.The hall was erected
 in 1905,having been part of the       
  Glasgow Exhibition of 1905.          </content>
