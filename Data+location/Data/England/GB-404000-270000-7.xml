		<title>07Where do people shop</title>
		<content> Most people shop in Reditch.  Around  
 24 that we inteviewed shoped at       
 Redditch.  They probably shop at      
 Redditch because it is quite near and 
 it has almost everything there.       
 Alvechurch is the nearest town to     
 rowney Green but only 3 people we     
 interviewed went shopping in          
 alvechurch.  This was probably because
 Alvechurch is quite small and dosen't 
 have many good shops.Birmingham       
 is the nearest large city to Rowney   
 Green. Most people who shop in        
 Birmingham probably work there because
 only 3 people shop in Birmingham.     
 Bromsgrove is a small town where 3    
 people shop but Bromsrove has more    
 shops than Alvechurch but not as many 
 as Redaitch.  North field is another  
 place were people shop North Field is 
 the place were least people shop.  In 
 Solihull 3 people we asked shoped.    </content>
