As so much of the population is from   
other parts of the country, a wide     
variety of accents can be heard within 
the area, from North Scottish, through 
South Scotland, Cumbria, Northumbrian, 
Yorkshire, the Midlands, right through 
to London, Wales and the West Country. 
DIALECT                                
The "Lanky Twang" (local dialect) can  
still be heard from the older          
inhabitants. Phrases like "Whee'r ta   
bahn?" (Where are you going) or "Tha   
gret niddi'ommer", (You stupid fellow) 
cause confusion among  newcomers who   
have to use their discretion in many   
cases, not liking to show their        
ignorance.                             
FOREIGN LANGUAGES                      
All families in the area speak English,
at present. Most children are taught   
French or German at Secondary School.  </content>
