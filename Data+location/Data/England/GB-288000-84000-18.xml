		<title>18Woodlands surrounding Kenn</title>
		<content> The area around Kenn and Kennford is  
 covered with many types of trees. In  
 the main the land used for farming has
 trees in clumps, mainly of the        
 deciduous type, such as oak, beech and
 chestnut. There are still the remains 
 of elm trees to be found, trees that  
 died in the late 1970's after being   
 attached by the Dutch Elm Beetle. Some
 farmers have planted new trees in     
 their place, which at the moment are  
 very young and immature trees. The    
 trees in their clumps in and around   
 the fields give protection to farm    
 animals during inclekent weather. The 
 trees on the Haldon escarpment tend to
 be coniferous type, mainly Scots Pine.
 The woodlands of Haldon come under the
 care and protection of the Forestry   
 Commission. This timber is used either
 for building or papermaking. Small    
 animals and deer abound in the woods. </content>
