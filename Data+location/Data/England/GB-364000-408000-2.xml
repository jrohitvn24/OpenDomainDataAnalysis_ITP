		<title>02Eating Out around Horwich</title>
		<content>   Most people in the area use their   
 local{fish and chip shop}as a         
 substitute for home cooked meals. Few 
 people do not use this amenity. Many  
 people also use the{Chinese and Indian
{Take-aways.                           
                                       
   A small number of households have a 
 completely vegetarian diet but the    
 vast majority have a varied diet.     
                                       
   Within a five mile radius of the    
 town centre there are a variety of    
 eating houses. These include the      
 Beehive{Cavalier Steak House}which is 
 on Chorley New Road, the{Appenzel     
 which is on Babylon Lane about three  
 miles from Horwich and the{Yew Tree   
 which is situated in the Rivington    
 countryside near Horwich.
