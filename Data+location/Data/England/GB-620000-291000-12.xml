		<title>12Farming - a gamekeepers year</title>
		<content> In{Spring}the{gamekeeper}prepares for 
 the years shooting by{penning}        
{pheasants}to lay eggs to be hatched.  
 Birds are fed{special pellets to make 
{the eggs fertile.} During the Summer  
 the young pheasants are reared and the
 gamekeeper spends much time carrying  
 food and water to the young birds and 
 watching for and destroying vermin.{In
{Autumn the shooting season begins.    
 The gamekeeper continues to feed the  
 birds and completes his organisation  
 of the shooting days. His main task is
 to recruit and organise teams of      
{beaters who raise the birds for the   
{guns.} The life of a gamekeeper is    
 lonely, but healthy and rewarding.  He
 develops a keen interest in the       
 natural world and has much freedom to 
 organise his daily programme of work. 
{Two gamekeepers are employed on the   
{Morningthorpe Estate.                 </content>
