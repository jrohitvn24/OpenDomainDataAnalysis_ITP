		<title>15A Possible Future?</title>
		<content>   One very interesting development for
{Heywood} emerged from the work done by
 the children of St. Joseph's School.  
 It is possible that Heywood is        
 becoming a {Dormitory town,}especially
 for Manchester. Several factors point 
 in this direction. There has been     
 considerable private housing          
 development, close to the{ Motorway,} 
 at Hopwood, yet there has been no     
 major industrial development. There is
 a much greater amount of {Storage     
{space,} which uses the Motorway. This 
 is borne out by the work of the {Fire 
{Brigade}which now concentrates on     
 Storage and on the Motorway.(See p.16)
 A survey of {Housing} in the area     
 showed that many people living there  
 worked away, mainly in Manchester, but
 also in Leeds, Wigan and Warrington.It
 may be that the {Future} of Heywood   
 lies in this direction.               </content>
