		<title>11HOME LIFE</title>
		<content> In 1985 a normal day of childs life is
 like waking up,having a               
 wash,breakfast,getting dressed andthen
 going to school.School finishes at    
 about 3.30pm.After school some people 
 have hobbies like                     
 Brownies,Guides,Gymnastics,swimming   
 etc. Once we get home we may go out   
 play with our friends or have tea.    
 Sometimes we have friends to tea.If we
 are lucky we have friend around to    
 spend the night. In the holidays if we
 think the weather is nice we might be 
 taken out to the seaside orsomewhere  
 else.If it is rainy we normally stay  
 in and watch T.V. or play a           
 game.Sometimes we might help our      
 mother do some housework or help our  
 dad clean the car or do the garden.   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
