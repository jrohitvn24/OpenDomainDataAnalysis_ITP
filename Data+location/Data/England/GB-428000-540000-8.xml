 My house is a bungalow.It is about ten
 years old.Its position is nearly at   
 the end of the street.                
   My house is made with               
 brick,metal,wood,glass and plaster.It 
 has eight rooms,a bathroom,a          
 lavatory,a lounge,a kitchen,a games   
 room,and four bedrooms.It also has a  
 hall.                                 
   At the back and at the front of my  
 house are two gardens,they are both   
 fairly big,the front garden is about  
 30 meters square,at the back about 40 
 meters square.                        
   My house has a garage built onto the
 side.The garage also acts as a shed   
 for keeping tools and leftover paint. 
 The house has a total of ten windows  
 including three facing farmlands      
 towards Cassop and sherburn. STUART
