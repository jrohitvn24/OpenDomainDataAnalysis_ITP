		<title>02Waking Up</title>
		<content> I wake up at about seven thirty. I    
 either wake up on my own or dad wakes 
 me up. I have a bedroom to myself.    
 It's a small one but it's cosy. I've  
 got a single bed, one cupboard, a     
 small armchair that I upholstered     
 (repaired) and varnished. It is       
 usually tidy. I shall explain about my
 house. It's an old  pub called  Rose  
 and Crown in a small village called   
 Dinnington. It's quite a big building.
 I usually lie in bed and grumble      
 before I get up. I wear pyjamas in    
 bed.  These are a sort of trousers and
 jacket. Then I go to the bathroom and 
 have a wash and brush my teeth. Then I
 get dressed. First I put on my socks  
 and pants then I put on my trousers,  
 shirt, tie and jumper then I put on my
 shoes and brush my hair.
