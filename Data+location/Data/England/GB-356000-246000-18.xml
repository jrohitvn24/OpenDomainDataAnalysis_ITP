		<title>18Transport in the Felton Area</title>
		<content> The National Bus Company provides a   
 bus service between Bromyard and      
 Hereford on the main road passing     
 through the area, but the settlements 
 of Ocle Pychard and Felton are badly  
 served.  A private bus service        
 operates on Wednesdays and Fridays,   
 making one journey in each direction  
 on these days through Felton and      
 Preston Wynne.  Most families have two
 cars or more.  Motor cycles are used  
 by younger people and even tractors   
 are occasionally used for social      
 visits.  Cycles are mainly used by    
 young children, but some field workers
 use them for local journeys.
