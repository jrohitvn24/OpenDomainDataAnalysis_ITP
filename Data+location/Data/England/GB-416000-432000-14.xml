		<title>14UNDERCLIFFE CEMETERY</title>
		<content>    On  its  opening  in {1884,} it was
 described as{"one of the most striking
{and beautiful features of the town."  
  In its 25 acres, planned by landscape
 gardener W.Gay,are many fine monuments
 of granite,marble and stone.     These
 were put up in memory of dead citizens
 some of whom are famous in the history
 of   Bradford  {e.g.  Mawson,    joint
{architect of the  Wool Exchange  &amp; the
{Town Hall;  Milligan, the First Mayor;
{&amp; Illingworth, a textile manufacturer.
                                       
   The cemetery is  now  no longer used
 for  burials.     Although  the  views
 over  the city  are still magnificent,
 the grounds themselves in recent years
 have become neglected.    Fortunately,
 public  concern   to   preserve    the
 cemetery  as a piece of  local History
 has led to its purchase by the Council
 with plans to restore it.             </content>
