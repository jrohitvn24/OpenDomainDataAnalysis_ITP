		<content> I get up at half past eight and get   
 ready for{school.}My school bus comes 
 at ten past nine. We have playtime    
 until half past nine then I go into   
 class. We get swimming and I went in  
 the deep end for the first time. We   
 come back from swimming and get a     
 playtime. We did a table square and   
 saw a dead hedgehog. Then we go to    
 dinner. We get out of school at four  
 o' clock. I get home at twenty to     
 five. I go home on the second run. I  
 do some of my homework when I get     
 home. Then I have some tea and go to  
{Brownies.}I was going to get a badge  
 but it hadn't arrived. Then at eight  
 when I get out I do the rest of my    
 homework. Then I watch TV and go to   
 bed.
