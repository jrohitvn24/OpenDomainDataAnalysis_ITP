		<content> Mrs Wright has been{warden}for 3      
 years. She carries a bleeper around.  
 If there is an{emergency}it will      
 bleep. There is a wooden thing with   
 the numbers of the rooms on. If a{lady
 goes out she would put the out sign   
 on. In the kitchen was a gas cooker.  
 The{residents}were not allowed to use 
{gas cookers}but the kitchen had one   
 just in case they could not use       
{electricity.}There was a bath and a   
 shower in the{bathroom.}We visited the
 longest staying resident. Her room was
 very tidy. There was a tiny{kitchen   
 with a tiny half cooker. She had her  
 own{televison}and bathroom. She was   
 83 and had lived there 18 years. She  
 cleans her own{flat}and has a{garden. 
 Upstairs is a spare room for visitors.
 There is a{standing lift}to go        
 upstairs. There is a trolley{library. 
 The housing service was open in 1967. </content>
