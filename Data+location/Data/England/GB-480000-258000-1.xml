		<content>   Our area is important because it    
 contains{4 villages}with a total      
 population of well under 3000.        
                                       
   It has variety - arable land, an    
 aquadrome, old churches, new roads, an
 aggregate works.                      
                                       
   Within that framework there are old 
 customs and traditions that are still 
 observed and at other times examples  
 of where parts of the{HISTORY}of a    
 village have been obliterated.        
                                       
   Campaigns, external and internal    
 change to buildings too!              
                                       
   All have combined to make a         
 significant impact on the lives of    
 villagers on the edge of a{market town
 in the{East Midlands.
