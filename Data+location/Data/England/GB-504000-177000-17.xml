		<content> The agricultural land in the area is  
 mainly grade 1 land (very fertile). It
 grows such things as potatoes,        
 cabbages, barley and wheat. Much of   
 the produce is sold locally. The      
 building of the airport has affected  
 the farmland because it has changed   
 the level of the water table and made 
 it less fertile. The area between     
 Holloway Lane and the M 4 was once    
 also grade 1 land. This area was then 
 used  as a refuge dump and later      
 returned to farmland. However, it was 
 not good enough to farm and is now    
 used to graze horses. It collects     
 large amounts of water and yet cannot 
 be built upon for 15 years.           
 Restrictions are now much stricter and
 the Greater London Council are        
 determined to resist pressure to build
 on farmland
