<title>21Thundridge Old Church</title>
<content>

Corrections and additions made to the existing article "Thundridge Old Church":  &lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />The original village of Thundridge was a km or so east of its present position. All that remains of the old settlement is the ruined C15th tower of the old church and what is left of a C17th moated manor house called Thundridge Bury (knocked down in 1811). The church was known as "All Hallows and Little Saint Mary" and was (in 1853) demolished, to be replaced by the new church of St. Mary, in the new Thundridge location. Most of the stone from the old church was used to renovate Sacombe Church, which is why so little remains. The site was a popular picnic spot in Victorian days, but today it is overgrown. The graveyard is now difficult to walk through, but we were able to read some of the gravestones. The oldest dated back to the early 1700s and some have been moved to Ware museum for safekeeping and display. The church tower is in a dangerous state, but you can still see the C12th doorway. It is a shame to see the former church so badly looked after.   &lt;br />
