		<content> Mr.Lay farms the land around          
Netherton. He grows 750 acres of       
barley,maize, sugar beet,turnips and   
300 acres of grassland for sheep and   
cattle. There are also fields of pigs  
owned by the Pig Improvement Company   
which is based near by.                
 Most houses in the village are made   
from Cotswold stone with brick corners 
for strength.There are many dry-stone  
walls.These are built by hand without  
cement.In the garden of the old farm-  
house are 8 brick beehives.Baskets can 
be placed on each platform for hives.  
Openings to the front and rear allow   
easy access to the garden flowers.     
 The village and farm have changed     
little over the last 200 years.Only    
machinery has changed.40 years ago     
Mr.Beck ploughed the land with a team  
of horses.He ploughed 1 acre of land   
a day.Now tractors and combines do it. </content>
