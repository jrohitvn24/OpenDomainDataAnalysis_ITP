		<title>13A FARM BORDERING WHITLEY</title>
		<content> Woodbank Farm has 55 acres. We have 45
 cows and three heifers.Our dog fetches
 the cows every morning and night      
 except in the winter because they are 
 kept inside.The{two}cats live in the  
 implement shed, we give them milk     
 every night and they hunt the rest of 
 their food. We have a shed at the back
 of the garage where we keep 11 hens   
 and we keep a broody one in the       
 shippon. We have one cow trailer that 
 carries calves to Chelford Market on  
 some Mondays.  We grow apples, pears, 
 plums and damsons, and sometimes      
 strawberries for ourselves,and we grow
 silage or hay for our cows. We have 44
 black and white cows and one brown and
 white cow.Mr F and Mrs F work the farm
 on their own, but get help from their 
 neighbours when harvesting silage and 
 hay. There is a large wood in the     
 middle of which there is a rubbish tip</content>
