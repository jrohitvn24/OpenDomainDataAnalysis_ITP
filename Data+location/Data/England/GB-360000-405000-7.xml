Caroline Midgley and Anita. I was on   
Ann and Jeanettes team . When it was   
time for the other team to bat,  the   
whistle went so we said they could have
their turn next playtime. The classes  
all lined up to come into school and we
came in as age groups with junior 4    
first.  We had a maths test with Mrs.  
Henry then she finished reading the    
story which we started on Monday. Then 
it was dinnertime we played rounders   
and then went into school for our      
dinner. After dinner we played rounders
on the field until 1.15 then we came in
