		<title>09Saint Helena's Church.</title>
		<content> This monumental but ugly building     
 dominates the Lundy skyline.It was    
 completed in 1897 and fulfilled the   
 dream of the island's owner the Rev.  
 Hudson Grosett Heaven- although it    
 ruined the family financially.        
 The church,far too large for its tiny 
 congregation,has always been more     
 symbolic than practical.              
 Weather damage is very evident with   
 limestains on the brickwork lining and
 tiles lifting off the floor.However   
 the tradition of worship is maintained
 -mainly by holiday makers and visiting
 clerics.The old vestry now has a bed  
 to provide over-night accomodation.   
 When we were there the bleakness of   
 the church was lightened by vases of  
 wild narcissi.One group of children   
 attended evensong and despite the lack
 of accompaniment they enjoyed the     
 singing and the service.              </content>
