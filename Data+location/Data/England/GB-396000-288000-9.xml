		<title>09SHOPPING AT SAVACENTRE</title>
		<content>  Savacentre is a large hypermarket in 
 Oldbury. It sells thousands of        
 different items and is usually very   
 crowded. Savacentre has 11 aisles and 
 32 check-out points. Each check-out   
 has a conveyor belt where items pass  
 the check-out person. The price of    
 each item is then entered into a till 
 and you are given a receipt for the   
 things you have bought. The           
 hypermarket has a very large car park 
 for its' customers and even sells its'
 own petrol. People come from a very   
 large area to shop at Savacentre      
 because it sells so many different    
 things and often the prices are a     
 little cheaper than in other shops.   
 Savacentre is very close to the       
 motorway which also helps customers   
 reach it more easily.
