		<content>   This is an area of hills, valleys,  
 woods and heathland, but you can also 
 see where humans have been at work!   
   Between Bramley and Wonersh there is
 the Bramley stream, a tributary of the
 Wey which is just outside our area.   
   There are extensive mature woodland 
 areas characterised by oak, beech and 
 coniferous plantations.Grassy farmland
 is found where the soil is neither to 
 sandy or too chalky.                  
   The predominance of natural         
 woodland and the continuing existence 
 of the more traditional small fields  
 with trees and hedgerows create, not  
 only a variety of landscapes, but also
 an intimate human scale where there   
 can be sympathy between land use,     
 landscape, the countryside dweller and
 the recreationalist.
