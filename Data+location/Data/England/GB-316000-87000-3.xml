		<title>03MILL FARM BRANSCOMBE.</title>
		<content> Mill Farm is in a valley between two  
 streams. It is called Mill Farm       
 because it has a mill driven by a     
 water wheel, which was used until 70  
 years ago.It has still got the        
 workings.Mill Farm is rented from the 
 Nationel Trust by Mr and Mrs Denning. 
 Mr Denning milks a heard of about 30  
 cows.The milk is sent to Honiton      
 Express Dairys to be made into cheese,
 yoghurt, cream and butter.There are   
 also 24 heifers and about 30 calves.  
 Mr Denning takes his cattle to        
 Axminster Market.In the winter the    
 cows are fed hay which has been made  
 from the fields in the summer.There   
 are 112 acres of land at Mill Farm,   
 some woodland but mostly rough        
 pasture. Vistors come to stay for bed 
 and breakfast in the summer at Mill   
 Farm.
