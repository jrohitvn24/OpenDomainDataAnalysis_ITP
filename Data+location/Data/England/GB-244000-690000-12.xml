		<title>12THE GRAHAMS of BUCHANAN</title>
		<content> In 1682 James,the 3rd marquis         
 purchased this estate from the        
 Buchanans. In the 1850's Buchanan     
 castle now a ruin,was built. It was   
 designed by William Adam. In 1935 this
 house proved to be too large and the  
 Grahams moved to Auchmar just past    
 Milton of Buchanan on the way to      
 Balmaha.                              
  The emblem of the Grahams is the     
 laurel and their motto 'Ne oublie'.   
  The present Marquis of Graham has 2  
 farms now in the estate. He is a very 
 keen farmer. His estate has about 1 or
 2 thousand acres. He has a flock of   
 about 1000 sheep and about 350 cows.  
  He has 3 of a family,2boys and 1     
 girl. Their ages are 13,11,and 9.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
