		<title>10SALISBURY MARKET</title>
		<content> Salisbury Market has about 100 stalls.
 On Market days coaches bring in       
 shoppers from surrounding villages.   
 The Market held by Charter from 1290, 
 forbids the holding of any other      
 market within 6.4 miles.              
 One lady has been coming to the market
 for 25 years, she told us that it is a
 very good market. She needs to arrive 
 at the market early to set up her     
 stall. There were many people buying  
 and selling goods when we visited the 
 market. It was very busy. Most of the 
 stalls sell clothes but some people   
 were busy buying their vegetables and 
 fruit. We saw many people selling     
 flowers and plants for the garden. We 
 also saw one man selling computer     
 cassettes.                            
 Some of the stalls are put up around  
 the Medieval Poultry Cross.
