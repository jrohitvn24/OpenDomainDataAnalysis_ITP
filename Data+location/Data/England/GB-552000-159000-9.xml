		<content>                                       
   "The Horns" is a fifteenth century  
building. Before it became a pub the   
buildings were three cottages. There   
are two fireplaces which have been     
partly bricked up but they are still   
very large..                           
   The opening hours are really two    
days for the workers. They get in 20   
barrels of beer at a time. The people  
who run the pub have been there for    
over 11 years and have lots of helpers.
   We asked what the most popular drink
was. They gave us four answers: whisky,
gin, bitter and lager. The most        
expensive drink was a port n' brandy.  
The busiest day is Saturday. They have 
lots of people who enjoy the pub who   
come in from everywhere. They sell 556 
pints of beer a day.
