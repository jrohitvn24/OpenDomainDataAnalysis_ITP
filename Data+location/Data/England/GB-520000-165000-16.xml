		<content>A GROUP OF LOCAL PEOPLE WERE           
INTERVIEWED TO DISCOVER THE DIFFERENCES
IN LIFESTYLES BETWEEN THE 1930'S AND   
THE 1980'S.THESE RESIDENTS MOVED INTO  
THE AREA IN 1938 WHEN MANY OF THE      
HOUSES WERE BUILT.IN THOSE DAYS THERE  
WERE NO GARAGES OR FLATS AND VERY FEW  
LOCAL SHOPS.NEW RESIDENTS IN 1938 WERE 
TREATED TO FREE DELIVERY OF GROCERIES. 
A NEW HOUSE IN 1938 COST BETWEEN 700   
AND 900 POUNDS.IN 1985 THE SAME HOUSES 
COST BETWEEN 65000 AND 90000 POUNDS.   
DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR THERE WAS A
GERMAN AND ITALIAN PRISONER OF WAR CAMP
NEARBY.                                
"WHEN YOU WALKED PAST THE CAMP YOU FELT
SO SAD",SAID MRS.TREVAN,A LOCAL PERSON.
THE GENERAL FEELING WAS THAT,ALTHOUGH  
THE AREA HAS CHANGED A LOT PHYSICALLY  
FROM FIELDS AND TRACKS TO HOUSES AND   
ROADS,IT IS STILL A VERY PLEASANT PLACE
TO LIVE.                               </content>
