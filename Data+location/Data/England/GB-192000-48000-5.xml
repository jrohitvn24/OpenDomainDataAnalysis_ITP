		<title>05School Services in Grampound</title>
		<content>  Grampound School is a church school  
 which means that the Rector of the    
 church comes into school every week to
 teach the fourth year juniors.He is at
 all the services we have in church.We 
 go to the church in the village which 
 is called St.Nun's.It is a small      
 church but very pretty.We always go to
 church on Ascension Day.              
  The service we enjoy the most is the 
 one we hold at Christmas. Sometimes we
 have a Carol Service or a Christingle 
 service.Some years we dress up and act
 out the Christmas story.One year we   
 held up large cards to spell the word 
 Christmas then talked about what each 
 letter could stand for as regards     
 Christmas activities and customs.At   
 the end of every school year we have a
 special service to say goodbye to the 
 children who are leaving the school.
