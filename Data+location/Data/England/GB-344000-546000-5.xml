		<content> We found that most of the people we   
 surveyed had quite a lot of spare     
 time. Most people played sports such  
 as squash, badminton, keep-fit,       
 swimming and walking. They did these  
 regularly and were mainly in a club.  
 As these facilities are not available 
 in Low Hesket, they are mainly done in
 Carlisle. There was a Playgroup, and  
 the Church organised meetings and     
 clubs, coach trips and disco's. The   
 price is the same as they would pay in
 a town. Alot of people went to the    
 local Public House, which is the Rose 
 and Crown, quite regularly but some   
 people travelled to High Hesket to the
 Public House there.
