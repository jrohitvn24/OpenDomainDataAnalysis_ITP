		<content> The grass is then carted back to the  
 farm and stacked in a clamp where it  
 ferments and becomes{silage.}I then   
 wait for it to rain to make the grass 
 grow for the next time. To help it I  
 spread fertilizer on all the grass    
 several times during the summer.      
                                       
 Winter is different and harder. The   
 cows are inside all the time so food  
 has to be taken to them several times 
 a day. They also need bedding. This   
 involves rolling out a large round    
 bale between every 25 cows so that    
 they keep clean.                      
                                       
 Most of the cows calve during the     
 winter months so any new arrivals have
 to be cleaned up and cared for. The   
 calves stay with their mothers for a  
 few hours until they have had a drink 
 of colostrum.(continued)              </content>
