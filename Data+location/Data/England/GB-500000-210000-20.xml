		<title>20LOCAL ISSUES.</title>
		<content> These issues feature in local POLITICS
 as arguments between landowner farmers
 and the general public.               
 ENCLOSURES:Some farmers have sold off 
 small plots of land as enclosures for 
 privately owned horses to graze.They  
 are able to do this without asking for
 planning permission as Government     
 LEGISLATION allows for land_use to be 
 changed if the enclosure is less than 
 5 acres.This is annoying many people  
 as planning permission is required to 
 alter a house but not a field!        
 STUBBLE BURNING:Villagers complain    
 each year about this practice.They    
 fear that one day homes will burn too.
 Calls are being made for farmers to   
 stop this tradition. Drivers also     
 complain about the smoke adversely    
 affecting visibility on local roads.
