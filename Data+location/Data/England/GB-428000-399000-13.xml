		<title>13Wortley Village</title>
		<content> Wortley stands on high ground         
 overlooking the River Don and is on   
 the main Sheffield to Halifax road. It
 is a very old village. People were    
 even living here in Anglo-Saxon times 
 and it is mentioned in the Domesday   
 Book. The houses have changed very    
 little since they were rebuilt by Lord
 Wharncliffe about 150 years ago. They 
 are made of stone with stone flagged  
 roofs and look very quaint. They are  
 clustered round the church which was  
 first built in the 14th century.      
 People who worked on the estate lived 
 in them and their children went to the
 school that the earl built. Most of   
 the people who live there now are     
 retired. There are some new houses    
 but the residents work away from      
 Wortley either in the steel works or  
 in the surrounding towns.
