Cowlinge has no railway, the nearest   
town is eight miles away. From Monday  
to Friday, an early morning bus comes  
into the village and takes workers from
here and neighbouring villages to their
work in Haverhill. Every Wednesday a   
coach comes into the village taking    
shoppers into Bury-St-Edmunds. By      
walking 1.25 miles to the main road    
there is a very limited service of     
buses to Haverhill and Bury-St-Edmunds.
It is,therefore,essential to have      
private transport for most residents to
get to their place of work.
