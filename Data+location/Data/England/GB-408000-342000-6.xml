		<title>06The Stone Mason in Ellastone</title>
		<content>There is a Stone Mason in the area.They
make big round balls and mouldings out 
of large pieces of rock. Six people    
work there.The workers mostly live     
in Uttoxeter. There were only four     
people four years ago. The work is     
done by hand with electric hand tools  
to help. It is very skilled and        
delicate work.                         
The yard has been open 14 or 15 years. 
The hours they work are 8.oo am        
till 4.30 pm.The things they often     
repair go to churches.They also        
make stone  windows frames, chimney    
pots, stone stair cases.               
They use lime stone and sandstone      
which they get from the local          
quarry. They had to cut a big stone    
very neatly and tidily.
