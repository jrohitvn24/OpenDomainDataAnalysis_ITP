		<title>16CHERRY BURTON-A HOBBY</title>
		<content> I learnt the rudiments of spinning and
 weaving during my training as an      
 occupational therapist.Weaving is a   
 particularly effective therapy but the
 1st stages of spinning proved too     
 difficult.Later the proud owner of a  
 large black sheep,producing quantities
 of wool inspired my husband to        
 construct a splendid spinning wheel   
 and me to relearn the technique to    
 produce an acceptable yarn for        
 knitting Guernseys for my sailing     
 family.Nowadays my mixed flock enables
 me to spin yarn in many shades.It is  
 plyed into 2 ply on the wheel.After   
 washing it is stretched and dried for 
 knitting.It is satisfying to recognise
 members of the flock in individual    
 garments.My ambition is to weave my   
 own yarn on a large foot power loom,  
 but this will have to wait until I    
 have more time.                       </content>
