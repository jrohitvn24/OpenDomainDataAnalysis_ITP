		<title>03ATTITUDES TO SCHOOL</title>
		<content> School takes up a good deal of an     
 individuals life, at least twelve     
 years (which isn't exactly fun.) I    
 just about survived the last seven    
 years of it.                          
 I thoroughly understand why many      
 people dislike school. Getting up     
 early and listening to teachers for   
 five hours is not at all enjoyable.   
 People who enjoy that sort of thing   
 are commonly known as ("swots!")      
 Some teachers see school as a place to
 make progress. I see it as a place you
 go to where you absorb as much        
 information as possible until you get 
 to the point where you explode. But   
 that's just my opinion, shared by the 
 rest of the first year puipls.
