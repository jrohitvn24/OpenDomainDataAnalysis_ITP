		<title>09The Golf Club</title>
		<content>The golf course was built in 1914.The  
club opens at 07.30 and closes at      
20.00 in the Winter and 21.30 in the   
Summer.The course is 180 acres of      
trees,flags,putting holes and grass,   
excellent for playing on.The club has  
only a few professionals at present    
and a few famous members.The game is   
very popular.Now there are 832 members 
in all categories juniors,non-playing, 
social and over-seas players.          
Approximately there are 61 members     
ready to join and 41 employees.The     
members mostly come from Beaconsfield  
but some come from elsewhere.For       
members it costs 12 pounds for 1 round 
of golf.They cut the putting holes with
a special tool like a cork screw.The   
manager has worked at the club for 5.5 
years and thinks a lot could be        
inproved but they do very well.
