		<content>  {Mrs. Pritchard}is St.Anne's school  
 governor. She attends all the school  
 activities and has never missed a     
 meeting. She also is on the Wyre      
 Forest District Council, and sits on  
 other committees too numerous to      
 mention. She was{Mayoress of Bewdley  
 1934-41 and 1949-50. In 1964 she was  
 awarded the{M.B.E.}for service to the 
 community. What is interesting about  
 her is her age. She has never         
 disclosed it, not even to the press or
 close friends but we think she is over
 95. This year she will retire from the
 board of governors after{50}years of  
 service.                              
   The tragedy in her life was the     
 wounding of her husband in the last   
 month of World War I, which left him  
 crippled until his death. Mrs         
 Pritchard carried on his dedication to
 local community work.                 </content>
