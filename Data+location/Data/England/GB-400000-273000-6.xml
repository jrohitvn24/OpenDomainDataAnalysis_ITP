		<content>{St. Michael's Church,}Cofton Hackett, 
 was built in l330 for the people who  
 lived in nearby Cofton Hall and the   
 surrounding farms.   It is a small    
 church, approximately thirty people   
 attend each Sunday.                   
 The vicar, Rev. I. Aveyard, is the    
 vicar of St.Andrew's Church, Barnt    
 Green, also.                          
 As there is a{churchyard}at St.       
 Michael's and not at St. Andrew's,    
 some of the people of Barnt Green are 
 buried at St. Michael's.              
 It is a very  pretty little church and
 with; the surrounding farmland ;it    
 makes the{landscape}very attractive.  
 It plays a very important part in the 
 lives of the people of Cofton Hackettt
 although it is some distance out of   
 the village.
