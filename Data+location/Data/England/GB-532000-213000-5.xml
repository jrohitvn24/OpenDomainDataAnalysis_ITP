		<title>05WARE PARK WOODLAND, WARE.</title>
		<content> Ware Park has many old trees, mainly  
 oaks,limes and beeches which had been 
 neglected until recently. Many elms,  
 wiped out by{Dutch Elm disease,}have  
 been felled and new trees planted.Part
 of an avenue of limes still exists. It
 used to stretch from Bengeo Street to 
 Glaxos in Ware. The remaining shallow-
 rooted limes have grown too tall and, 
 sadly, five have fallen in high winds.
 Only drastic surgery can save others. 
   Recently,{a tree surgeon}was allowed
 to set up his 5 acre base and build a 
 home on the edge of the woods. To mark
 his son's 1st birthday, he planted an 
{arboretum}of 1-yr-old trees.To replace
 elms, he has planted{Southern Beeches 
 which have grown 2\m in 5 years but he
 thinks they may outgrow their roots.  
  {Animals}in the woods include foxes, 
 grey squirrels, pheasants, partridges,
 rabbits, badgers and muntjack deer.   </content>
