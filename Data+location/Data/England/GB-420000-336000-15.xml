		<title>15CLAY PIGEON SHOOT</title>
		<content>    The shoot is a private club only   
 for club members. The shoot is near   
 the Ostrich Inn, in a field.          
    People take their own guns and some
 people take their own dogs.           
    The people shoot for fun, they     
 don't want to  shoot real birds. They 
 shoot clay pigeons instead. A clay    
 pigeon is a clay disc.                
    Some people go to watch them       
 shoot. They go on Sundays. On         
 Saturdays they set it up.             
    My brother works on a trap. A trap 
 is something that holds clay pigeons. 
 A trap makes the clay pigeon go up in 
 to the air. Some traps have seats. To 
 work a trap you have to pull a lever  
 with a clay pigeon on and then you let
 go of the lever and the clay pigeon   
 flies into the air.
