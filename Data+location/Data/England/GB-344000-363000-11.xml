 James and on his Saints day in July   
 each year a festival is held in his   
 memory.Children,their parents and     
 Sunday School teachers gather around  
 the Village Green carrying posies and 
 bunches of flowers.At 3pm a procession
 led by the Choir,the Rose Queen and   
 her retinue the Rector and children   
 moves to the Church grounds where many
 villagers are gathered.At the end of  
 the service the children take their   
 flowers and place them on any untended
 grave in the graveyard.This ancient   
 ceremony gives a great deal of        
 pleasure to the old people of the     
 Village and is a Thanksgiving to God  
 for the work of the Church in the     
 Village Community.Prayers and hymns   
 are also sung on the ancient{Beating  
{of the Bounds Ceremony}which takes
