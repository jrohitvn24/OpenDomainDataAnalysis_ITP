		<content> Sisley Leisure Industries are based at
 Pivington Mill. They make and produce 
 miniature working models of cars for  
 children. At Pivington Mill they      
 assemble all the parts which are made 
 at New Romney.                        
  The shell is made from fibre glass   
 and the vehicle is powered by an 8 h.p
 lawn mower engine. The cars top speed 
 is 25 m.p.h. and a gallon of petrol   
 lasts for 100 miles.                  
  The cost of the cars starts at Â£300  
 for a kit and go to Â£3000 for the top 
 of the range model.                   
  Sisley Leisure sell their vehicles to
 London stores such as Harrods, Hamleys
 and Selfridges who export to mainly   
 Arab countries. For this reason all   
 the cars are left-hand drive. The     
 models range from go-karts  and       
 buggies to Range Rovers.
