		<title>18An Ordinary Day (Cont.)</title>
		<content> evenings a week either to netball or  
 to meetings, but the nights I stay in 
 I try to finish work in time  to sit  
 down and watch the ten o'clock news.  
                                       
 When Dennis comes in , he has his     
 dinner and we sit andchat over a glass
 of wine before collapsing into bed    
 about mid-night. We do occasionally go
 out socially midweek but usually we   
 see friends for a meal or go to a     
 dance or the theatre on Saturday      
 evenings.                             
                                       
 Tonight I'm exhausted and gld to get  
 to sleep. I've just dropped off  when 
 suddenly I sit bolt upright. As Dennis
 asks me what's up I reply "Domesday". 
 He looks at me a bit odd and asks if I
 have been taking the latest film on   
 nuclear scenarios too much to heart.  
 Two hours later and here I am.....!   </content>
