		<title>14AN ARABLE FARM IN WADDINGTON</title>
		<content>   Lowfields Farm covers 520 acres. It 
 is owned by two brothers, one of whom 
 independantly runs a 20 sow pig unit  
 and fattens a few beef cattle. In 1985
 the farm grew 200 acres of wheat, 160 
 of barley, 40 of rape, 52 of sugar    
 beet, 30 of protein peas and a few    
 acres of potatoes. Sugar beet was the 
 most profitable crop. The price for   
 potatoes did not justify the effort.  
   One of the brothers' sons works on  
 the farm, the other having become a   
 gamekeeper. A daughter works there as 
 part of a Y.T.S. scheme. There are no 
 other workers, though one of the wives
 does the book-keeping.                
   Every day is different depending on 
 the season but each working day lasts 
 at least from 8.00am to 8.00pm. The   
 most important factor is the weather  
 since it is one of the few things the 
 farmer cannot control.                </content>
