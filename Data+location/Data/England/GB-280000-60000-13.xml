               My day begins with      
 feeding the chickens and then I have  
 my breakfast. After breakfast I feed  
 the pigs and they eat crushed barley ,
 and then I take the dog for a walk    
 down the lane. Next I pick up the eggs
 and take them home. I have a wash and 
 Mum takes my brother and me to school 
 by car.                               
        After school I arrive home at  
 3.50 and watch television until 4.30. 
 Then I feed the pigs and they eat     
 lettuces, potato peelings, tea-bags,  
 egg shells and rotten tomatoes.After  
 feeding the pigs I watch television   
 again. I like the cartoons best of    
 all. After tea I feed the chickens and
 pick up the rest of the eggs.  I      
 ride my bike and the dog follows me.  
 If there's time I help Dad with the   
 welding in his workshop.              </content>
