		<content> Many of the people interviewed in     
 Teversham chose to live there because 
 of their love for the countryside and 
 the quietness of village life, and    
 they were also near to the city.      
 We found that the older residents who 
 were well established used the village
 shop more than the relative           
 newcomers, who tended to shop in the  
 Cambridge supermarkets and also found 
 liesure facilities to their taste in  
 Cambridge. Teversham village has a    
 strong branch of the Royal British    
 Legion for ex-servicemen, and it also 
 boasts a "Conservative Club", as well 
 as the usual village organisations.   
 Many of the residents found pleasure  
 in tending their gardens and looking  
 after their houses and cars.
