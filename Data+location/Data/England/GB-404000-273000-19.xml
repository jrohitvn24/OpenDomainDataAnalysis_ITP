		<title>19BECKETTS' EGG PRODUCTION</title>
		<content> At Heath Farm they have about 50,000  
 battery hens. Each hen lays about 5-6 
 eggs a week. The hens are fed on food 
 trays called chain feeders. They have 
 110 grains including maize,soya and   
 wheat. Their water comes from pipes at
 the back of the cages. There are five 
 hens in each cage and they are cleaned
 out automatically twice a day because 
 there are fewer diseases if the cage  
 is clean.On the Free Range unit there 
 were several 1000 hens.At Chapel Green
 Farm they have got 25000 chicks. The  
 chicks that we saw were only 1 day old
 so they were very small.They are fed  
 on food called chick mash which con-  
 tains maize,wheat and vitamins.Water  
 comes from hanging dishes.Becketts    
 sent millions of dried eggs to help   
 starving people in Ethiopia.They      
 employ about 100 local people.{M.Green
