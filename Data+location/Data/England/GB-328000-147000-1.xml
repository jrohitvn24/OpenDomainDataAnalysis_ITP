		<title>01OUR NEW AMBULANCE STATION</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
 We are having a new ambulance station 
 built in Burnham-on-Sea right next    
 door to St. Andrew's School, so the   
 children spend much of their playtimes
 watching the builders at work.        
                                       
  It will provide garages for four     
 ambulances and there will be eight    
 rooms in the ambulance station. These 
 include male and female changing      
 rooms, crews' duty room, utility room 
 and blanket store.                    
                                       
  The new ambulance station is due for 
 completion on 16th December 1985, and 
 will cost around Â£180,000. It is      
 necessary to replace the existing     
 facilities at the Burnham War Memorial
 Hospital which are no longer adequate.
