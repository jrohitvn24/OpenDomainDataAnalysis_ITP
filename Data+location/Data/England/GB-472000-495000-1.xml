		<content>{Rosedale Abbey}is a small             
 village surrounded by heather and     
 bracken covered moorland. There is no 
 Abbey but a small part of a Cistercian
 Priory remains .At the turn of the    
 century it was a thriving{iron mining 
 community. Ruins of the mines may     
 still be seen in various parts of the 
 Dale.                                 
 Being an area of great natural beauty,
 many of the cottages are now holiday  
 homes.                                
 The main{occupations}of the Dale are  
 farming,forestry and tourism.         
 Some of the residents commute to      
 their places of work in Pickering,    
 Malton and some even in to            
 Middlesborough. Other people have work
 abroad and thus are able to live      
 in the more remote areas.             
 A small number of people have chosen  
 to retire into the area.              </content>
