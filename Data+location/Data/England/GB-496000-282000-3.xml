		<title>03SUDBOROUGH CHURCH</title>
		<content> Sudborough Church is a post-Norman,   
 l3th century church. It is relatively 
 large for the size of the village,    
 about l4O inhabitants. It is          
 transeptal in shape and was built on  
 the site of a Saxon church using some 
 of the original stones.               
    Behind the altar lies Sir Robert De
 Vere, standard bearer to the Earl of  
 Salisbury, who fell in battle against 
 the Saracens on a crusade in 1249. The
 church seats 100 to 120 and is in the 
 diocese of Peterborough.              
    It houses a magnificent clock which
 has no face or hands but chimes each  
 quarter. There is also a font made of 
 lead and covered with a carved wooden 
 lid. In the northern transept are two 
 14th century brass rubbings, depicting
 a man, his wife and their eleven      
 children.
