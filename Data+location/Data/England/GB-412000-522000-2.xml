		<title>02Buckhead Opencast Mine.1.</title>
		<content> Work at the opencast started at the   
 end of 1979,after public meetings and 
 amid much complaint from local people.
 By digging 1400 bore holes the site   
 engineers and geologists knew that    
 they would be able to take coal,      
 profitably, from an area of some 400  
 hectares, covering 16 coal seams.     
  Seventy men are employed on the site,
 but although it is an N.C.B. project  
 each process is contracted to other   
 firms, under the direction of the     
 N.C.B. site engineer and his deputy.  
  Visitors to the site must be         
 impressed by the caring attitude, held
 by the engineers, for the local       
 environment.They have been  most      
 careful to avoid any pollution of     
 nearby streams by storing waste liquid
 in deep lagoons, and they have        
 established good relationships with   
 local people.                         </content>
