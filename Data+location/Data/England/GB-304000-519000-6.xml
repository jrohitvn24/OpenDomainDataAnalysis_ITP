		<content> SOUTH MOSSES:                         
 South Mosses is built of stone and is 
 about two hundred years old. It is an 
 arable farm. They grow some crops,    
 barley,potatoes and turnips but these 
 are just for their own use to feed the
 animals. There are 600 acres of land  
 altogether and lots of machinery;     
 baler, several tractors, forage       
 harvester, silage trailer and muck    
 spreaders.                            
                                       
 Summary:-                             
 The other farms in the area are very  
 similar. Some have public water supply
 and one has its own spring well. The  
 type of farming is much the same on   
 all the farms; mainly cattle and sheep
 with few crops. The buildings are made
 of stone and some are over 300 years  
 old. Extensions or outbuildings have  
 been completed in concrete blocks.    </content>
