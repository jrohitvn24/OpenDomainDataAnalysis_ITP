		<title>11CATHOLICISM IN CLEATOR MOOR</title>
		<content> Mostly older folk attend Mass. Altar  
 boys wear a cassock  and  cotter which
 is a blue robe and white top.Sometimes
 at special masses they  wear  albs and
 carry acolytes  and the  cross  bearer
 goes at the front. The  masses usually
 last about an hour. The  priests often
 try to make  the  sermons  interesting
 and popular. The priests robes vary in
 colour acording  to the  time of year.
  At Christmas the priests wear white. 
  At Easter they wear red.             
  At Whit week they wear green.        
  At a funeral they wear purple.       
  At a baptism they wear white.        
 Our priests govern our school.        
 Nearly at the end  of mass  we recieve
 our  Lord. The priest that offers Mass
 mixes the  water  and wine, blesses it
 and drinks it.
