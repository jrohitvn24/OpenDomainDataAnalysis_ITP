		<title>13CIVIC AMENITY SITE, HESSLE</title>
		<content> The site is used for the disposal of  
 household refuse from the surrounding 
 area. The site, above the Humberfield 
 Quarry, consists of nine containers   
 and three compactors. The containers  
 are six metres long, two and a half   
 metres tall and hold fifteen tons of  
 waste each. The site handles 300 tons 
 of waste per week. The electrically-  
 powered compactors compress the waste 
 at a pressure of 2,800lbs/sq.in.,     
 causing the waste to be forced to the 
 back of the containers. There are     
 separate containers for soil and      
 rubble, metal, waste oil and large    
 household items. Bottles are collected
 according to their colour in "bottle  
 banks", and there is another container
 for metal cans. This is so that they  
 may be re-cycled. Once the containers 
 for waste are full they are taken down
 to the landfill site for disposal.    </content>
