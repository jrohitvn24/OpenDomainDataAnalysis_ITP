		<title>10LEEDS-LIVERPOOL CANAL</title>
		<content> The canal,which is 127 miles long, was
{built by  Sir Benjanin Gott's}        
 engineers to carry cargo. Today,it is 
 mainly used for{leisure cruising.}The 
 4th year children went on the canal   
 as part of the Humanities course.     
 The hired narrow boat was 70 feet     
 by 4 feet and had been equipped for   
 leisure cruising. The maximum speed   
 allowed was 4 mph to prevent the banks
 from being damaged by wash. We        
 encountered several{locks}which we    
 opened manually.One series took almost
 an hour to climb. Travelling the canal
 we passed Armley Mills, Kirkstall     
 Abbey and old factories.We saw a half-
 sunken ice breaker, no longer needed. 
 In one day we travelled from {Leeds   
{Basin to Rodley.}We were able to      
 experience what conditions were like  
 in past times.
