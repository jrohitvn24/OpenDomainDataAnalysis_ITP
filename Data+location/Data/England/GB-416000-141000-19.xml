		<title>19Police in Bulford</title>
		<content>  I interviewed Sergeant Durnford to   
 find out how Bulford Village/Camp is  
 policed.Bulford has no living in      
 policemen, but a sergeant and four men
 based in Amesbury have an office at   
 Bulford Camp.Because of the military  
 presence there is a strong liason     
 between the Royal Military Police and 
 the Civilian Police.Minor crimes on   
 Camp are dealt with by the M.P.'s.    
  Stealing from cars, meters, occupied 
 and unoccupied houses are the major   
 crimes.As too is the stealing of cars 
 left unattended whilst soldiers are   
 on exercise.Of great concern is the   
 number of sex offences involving under
 age girls.There is no serious drug/   
 solvent abuse problem.                
  The policing is done by mobile and   
 bicycle and there is always a back up 
 by Traffic Division in Salisbury for  
 more serious incidents and accidents. </content>
