		<title>17Beverley Eagles Jazz Band</title>
		<content> The Beverley eagles were formed in    
 1977. The first competition was in    
 1980 and our uniform was not good     
 enough to win many dress medals.      
      In the second season we did much 
 better, winning roughly 150 medals and
 8 trophies.  This was a great         
 improvement from the season before.   
 From then on we started winning nearly
 every competition.  On Saturdays we   
 performed at galas to raise enough    
 money to pay for transport.           
      This season started in early May 
 and we had a good start by becoming,  
{"Band of the Day",}in the first       
 competition.                          
      This year's uniform is white -the
 fanciest of the lot.  Kazoo players   
 wear red, drummers wear blue and the  
 banner section wear yellow.
