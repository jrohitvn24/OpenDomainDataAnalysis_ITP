		<content>                                       
   P.C.Hayward came to talk to us about
 the police force and what they do and 
 how they do it.P.C.Hayward has 1 stud 
 on his shoulder to show that he is a  
 constable.A sergeant has 3 stripes on 
 his arm ,an inspector has 2 studs,a   
 chief inspector has 3 studs and a     
 superintendant has a crown.           
   A policeman has to have a truncheon 
 and handcuffs just in case things get 
 out of hand.                          
   Policemen don't always put people in
 jail they help lost people.           
   Policemen can have cars,motorbikes  
 or bicycles.                          
 A policemans day is sometimes busy and
 sometimes not.He picks up reports of  
 crimes on his radio.He puts down car  
 numbers.He goes for walks or rides on 
 his bicycle to check everything is    
 alright.Some police are women.        </content>
