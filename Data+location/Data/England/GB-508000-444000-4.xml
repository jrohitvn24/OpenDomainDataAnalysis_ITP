		<content> Leven is a typical East Yorkshire     
 village.The older cottages which front
 the main road are built from bricks   
 made from local clays.They are        
 yellowish brown in colour. The local  
 brick has a high salt content &amp; many  
 older buildings show salt marks, the  
 brick also crumbles easily. The older 
 properties have red pantiled roofs.   
 About twenty years ago the village    
 expanded on both sides of the A165    
 with two small residential housing    
 developments.These are of three &amp; four
 bedroomed semi-detatched &amp; detatched  
 houses &amp; bungalows.These homes are    
 built in red or yellow bricks with    
 modern tiled roofs &amp; gardens.There are
 621 households in Leven 85% of which  
 are owner occupied.
