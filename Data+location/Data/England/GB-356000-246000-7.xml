		<title>07Hop Farming in Felton Area</title>
		<content> Hop flowers which grow on a vine      
 approximately five metres high are    
 used for the brewing of beer.         
 Rosemaund Experimental Farm and six   
 other farms grow hops in this area.   
 The different varieties grown are     
 Fuggles, Challenger, North Down and   
 Zenith.  The total area is 57.5       
 hectares.  The hops are harvested by  
 machine and at the farms are dried by 
 oil-fired burners and bagged under    
 pressure in 50 kg pockets.  Drying    
 time is approximately eight to ten    
 hours.  The hops are sold several     
 years in advance to the breweries.    
 The future of the hop as a crop is    
 uncertain.  The hop virus Verticillium
 wilt has claimed two farmers' hops in 
 the past year and the disease is      
 eradicated by grubbing up and not     
 replanting for at least five years.
