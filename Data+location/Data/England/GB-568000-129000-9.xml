		<title>09Pocket Money - ages 9 to 11</title>
		<content>    We asked the children in our class 
 about their pocket money. Two children
 did not get any while one receives as 
 much as Â£3.00 a week. Kerry and Mark  
 don't lose out because they get       
 sweets, drinks, ice cream etc. instead
 of pocket money. The median weekly    
 amount is Â£1.00 and the mean Â£1.35.   
 Girls do better than boys getting 20  
 pence more on average.                
    Most of the pocket money is saved  
 for things like holidays, presents or 
 more expensive things like watches or 
 remote control cars.                  
    Of Zoey's Â£1 pocket money she      
 spends 60p on sweets like chocolate   
 bars and chewing gum and 40p on pop   
 stickers. These are pictures of       
 different pop groups. You buy a book  
 to put the stickers in. Five stickers 
 cost 20p. The book tells you about the
 groups as well.                       </content>
