		<title>14MOTORWAY AND ROADS</title>
		<content> Our area is very close to the {M1     
{motorway}and this road can be seen    
 from several parts of our blocks.  We 
 counted the number of vehicles going {
{south} for five minutes.   There were 
 76 cars, 39 lorries and 15 vans.      
 From 1400 hours to 1405 hours we      
 counted the number of vehicles        
 travelling {north.} There were 51     
 cars, 51 lorries and 14 vans.   Our   
 nearest point of {access}to the       
 motorway is approximately three miles 
 from Kiveton.   This nearness might   
 prove important for industrial or     
 residential development in the future.
 Within our area we are adequately     
 served by good wide roads.
