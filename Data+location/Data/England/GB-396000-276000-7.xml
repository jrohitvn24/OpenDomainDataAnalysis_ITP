		<title>07Rubery in the late 1800's</title>
		<content> Rubery village at this time was made  
 up of a few cottages and shops        
 including a Post Office at the bottom 
 of the village, four public houses,   
 about nine farms, one clay pit and the
 Rubery Hill quarries.There was also a 
 nailers' warehouse at the bottom of   
 Cock Hill Lane.                       
{Rubery could even boast of having its 
{own railway station, but the most     
{dominating feature was the newly built
{Rubery Lunatic Asylum(as it was then  
{called), which was opened on 4th      
{January,1882.                         
 The station was about half a mile from
 the village, at the bottom of Holly   
 Hill and over-looked by The Cock Inn.
