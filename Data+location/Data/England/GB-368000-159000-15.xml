		<content> Tunley Recreation Centre, built in    
 1960, is a detached single storey     
 building situated near the centre of  
 the village, next to the football     
 pitch. The centre is the venue for    
 many village activities fund raising  
 dances discos, weekly bingo sessions  
 for the football club and private     
 functions such as wedding receptions. 
 A play group meets daily for the      
 pre-school age children. The local    
 village ladies frequently hold coffee 
 mornings at the centre.               
 The centre is also used by local pop  
 groups and bands who practise there.  
 Interested villagers attend weekly art
 and craft courses there.              
 The centre's organising committee meet
 monthly to discuss fund raising       
 activities and to produce the centre's
 newsletter.
