		<content>      The school is called Fir Ends    
 because the previous building was     
 originally built at the end of a large
 Fir wood and when the new school was  
 built the governors and head wished to
 retain the old name.                  
     The school serves three parishes, 
 Kirklinton,Scaleby and                
 Hethersgill.Originally it only served 
 Kirklinton and Scaleby but due to     
 falling numbers Hethersgill school    
 closed in 1984 and the catchment area 
 of Fir Ends was extended to include   
 Hethersgill.                          
      The school was built to hold 83  
 pupils and in 1985 has a population of
 79.These are taught by the headmaster,
 two full-time teachers and  two       
 part-time.It is a primary school and  
 takes children from the age of 4+ to  
 11. At the age of 11 children move on 
 to Secondary schools nearby.          </content>
