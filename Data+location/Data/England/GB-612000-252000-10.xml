		<title>10Rambling in Coddenham</title>
		<content> Coddenham and Hemingstone have a      
 wealth of paths indicated on Ordnance 
 Survey Maps. Unfortunately, some are  
 almost impassable, especially during  
 summer. Only a minority of landowners 
 maintain the rights of way. However,  
 things could change as there is a     
 growing interest within the local     
 community and the authorities, to     
 improve rambling in the area. One     
 example is the development of the     
 Gipping Valley Walk from Stowmarket to
 Ipswich which skirts our area. The    
 Suffolk County Council, Babergh and   
 Mid-Suffolk District Councils with    
 help from the countryside Commission  
 and the Manpower Services Commission, 
 are to plan circular walks along the  
 route, two of which occur in our area.
 These will be well maintained and     
 waymarked.                            
                                       </content>
