		<content>     We are on second sitting for lunch
 and I have two potatoes and some mince
 and an apple which I finish rather    
 quickly.  At break I fool around by   
 the tennis courts.  Next we have PE   
 lesson.  It is tennis.  I am partners 
 with Charlotte but I keep hitting the 
 ball too high.  Next we have RS with  
 Mrs Gay (Christian Aid) today.  Then  
 we have History which I like.  We have
 a quiz and the two sides draw.        
 Afterwards we have hymn practice.  We 
 sing and sing until the last bell goes
 at 4.10 and then we go home to        
 homework and tea.
