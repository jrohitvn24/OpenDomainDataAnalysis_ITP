		<title>12New building work in Gayton</title>
		<content>                                       
At the time of last census in 1981,    
the population of Gayton stood at      
495 with 112 people (approx. one       
quarter) under the age of 18. As these 
children grow up and marry, many who   
wish to will not be able to stay in    
Gayton. The main reason is that the    
houses are so expensive. Over the last 
two years, the cheapest house to be    
offered for sale was 62,000 pounds and 
even a small terraced cottage wouldn't 
sell for under 60,000 pounds. These    
would be outside the price range of    
most first time buyers. Because a      
"Green Belt" surrounds Gayton the only 
houses being built are those on the    
sites of those previously demolished   
or in gardens of existing ones.        
In 1981 there were 179 dwellings in    
the village - this is not likely to    
increase by many in the future.        </content>
