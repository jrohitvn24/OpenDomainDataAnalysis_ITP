		<title>03BROCKET HALL - PART TWO</title>
		<content> In 1805 William Lamb married the young
 Caroline Ponsonby, the only daughter  
 of the Earl of Bessborough.  She was  
 born in 1785 and lived with her       
 grandmother, Lady Spencer, at         
 Devonshire House in London.  At first 
 the newly-weds were happy, but Lady   
 Caroline lost her heart to Lord Byron,
 the poet.  They became good friends   
 but their friendship ended in 1813.   
 She wrote her first novel called      
 "Glenarvon" in which Byron was        
 criticized.  She kept it a secret from
 everyone except a governess, and      
 worked by candlelight in Brocket Hall 
 at the dead of night.  When Byron read
 "Glenarvon" he made harsh remarks     
 about it and soon the remarks were    
 passed on to Lady Caroline.  She      
 stayed on at Brocket Hall in virtual  
 solitude for the rest of her life.
