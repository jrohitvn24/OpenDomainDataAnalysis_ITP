		<title>13CHILDREN'S GAMES</title>
		<content> Here are some games I like to play in 
 the playground.Electric               
 chairs,tig,chocolate,leap-frog and    
 stuck-in-the-mud.Leap-frog is a game  
 where some people bend down so that   
 they hold onto their knees or ankles  
 and  wother person runs up to         
 them,places their hands on the other  
 persons back and jumps over him.They  
 carry on taking it in turns.          
   Electric chairs is a game where one 
 person lies on the ground with their  
 legs bent in the air. nother person   
 sits on the first persons feet who    
 pushes their legs upwards.The person  
 sat on the feet flies up into the air 
 and either lands on their feet or     
 their bottom.                         
   Tig is a game where someone is on   
 it.Everyone runs away and that person 
 tries to touch or "tig" them.
