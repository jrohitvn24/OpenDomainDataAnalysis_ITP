		<title>08A LORRY DRIVER'S DAY</title>
		<content> My Dad's name is Les and he is a lorry
 driver. He gets up at 2 in the        
 morning. He has some corn flakes and 2
 pieces of toast then he puts on his   
 boots, unlocks the door and goes out. 
 It is about 6 or 7 miles from out     
 house to the yard at Beddington. The  
 lorry that he drives is a DAF 2500    
 turbo intercooling. The firm he works 
 for is Superdrug, and the car he      
 drives is called an Astra 1600 G1     
 Estate. My Dad then goes off to the   
 shops that he has to deliver to. He   
 has been up about 5 hours when I get  
 up. Sometimes he has to travel long   
 distances. He delivers nappies,       
 sweets, shampoo, baby powder and      
 razors. He comes home at 4.15 and has 
 a cup of tea and a chat with my Mum.
