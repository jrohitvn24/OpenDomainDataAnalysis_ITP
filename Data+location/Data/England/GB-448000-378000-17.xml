		<title>17A WALK NEAR HARTHILL</title>
		<content> Down by the canal we went,the rain    
 pouring,the mud getting more sludgy as
 our 6-mile walk began. Puddles started
 to get bigger, and the splashes on the
 surface of the canal looked sharp and 
 fierce. Now and again a coal train    
 would go past nearby.In some of the   
 clear bits of the canal I could see   
 the shadows of some pikes.We went     
 under a few bridges, one called       
 Devil's Hole Bridge (I've still to    
 find out why it's called that) and we 
 saw quite a few locks.I didn't feel   
 all that wet but I was.Soon we reached
 Kiveton Park Station, then through    
 more puddles, and eventually back to  
 Harthill. Up the farmyard, down the   
 street, back to school; into the warm 
 classroom, and then it was letting    
 water out of shoes time.
