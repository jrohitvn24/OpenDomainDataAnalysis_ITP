		<title>14The School</title>
		<content>     There is only one school in the   
 D-Block,called the Burlington School. 
 It was founded in 1877 as an all-age  
 school for the children of the workers
 at the nearby Burlington Slate        
 quarries, and is now a primary school 
 with about 90 children on roll,boys   
 and girls aged from 4 to 11. It is    
 a church school,being voluntarily     
 controlled by the local Anglican      
 church of St. Cuthbert's,with the     
 local vicar being involved in both    
 teaching and administration.          
        There is no secondary school in
 the D-Block,but the children (or their
 parents) do have a choice of secondary
 schools which they can attend -in     
 Dalton, Ulverston, Coniston, or       
 Barrow.
