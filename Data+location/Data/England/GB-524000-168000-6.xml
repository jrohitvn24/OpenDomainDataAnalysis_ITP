		<content>   There are many different types of   
 Holy Places in Wimbledon,the most     
 abundant being churches .There is one 
 Synagogue along Worple Road,a Mosque  
 in Wimbledon Park and a number of     
 churches.In Copse Hill there is an    
 Anglian church ,in Edge Hill there is 
 The Sacred Heart; a Catholic          
 church.Along Worple Road there is a   
 Methodist church.Opposite the         
 Synagogue there is a Christian Science
 Movement church,and in Mansell Road   
 there is the Trinity United           
 church.There is Emmanuel Church,this  
 is probably the most beautiful church 
 in Wimbledon.There is a Baptist church
 along Queens Road,opposite the police 
 station.                              
   Wimbledon is,I think a very         
 religious                             
 area with Christianity _in all shapes 
 and forms being the dominant religion.</content>
