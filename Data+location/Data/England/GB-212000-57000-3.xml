		<title>03MARINE LIFE IN LERRYN RIVER</title>
		<content>       Several species of fish are     
 found in the river.                   
      {Sea-trout}and{salmon}are        
 indigenous to the river and spawn in  
 it's upper reaches. However to help   
 maintain the stocks of these fish,    
 especially the salmon, the{South      
{West Water Authority}operate a fish   
 breeding programme in the river where 
 it runs through the Boconnoc Estate.  
      The fish are{stunned}and  the    
 eggs and sperm removed and            
 artificially fertilized. In this way  
 thousands of embryos are produced and 
 put in{hatcheries.}When the{fry}are   
 large enough to give them a good      
 chance of survival, they are released 
 into the{river}from where they{migrate
 to their feeding grounds in the open  
 sea. Ultimatelty some of the mature   
 fish will return to the river to      
{spawn.                                </content>
