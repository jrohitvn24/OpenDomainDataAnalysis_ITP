		<content>   {Manor Farm}is in the small village 
 of{Gamston.}It is farmed by Mr. Potts 
 and his son. They have lived there for
 fifteen years. The farm at present    
 covers 148 acres but there are fears  
 that much of it will be used for a new
 housing development in the near       
 future.                               
    The farm buildings are very old and
 were once the stables of a posting    
 house for horse-drawn vehicles        
 travelling to Nottingham. On the wall 
 of one of them has been carved Ruth   
 May 1826-October 1837. Mr. Potts      
 thinks she may have been a servant    
 girl who worked there for that time.  
 Mr. Potts also has a very interesting 
 collection of old farm tools.
