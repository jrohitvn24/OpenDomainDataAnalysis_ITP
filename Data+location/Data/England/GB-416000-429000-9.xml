		<content> On Sunday morning I attend church.It  
 is situated on Church Street and is   
 called the{Moravian Church.}I do not  
 attend church as often as I did when I
 was younger.I usually only attend     
 church when we have a parade which is 
 the first Sunday in the month.I also  
 attend the 9th Bradford Company{Girls 
{Brigade}who are associated with our   
 church.There are 4 groups in our Girls
 Brigade;Explorers,Juniors,Seniors and 
 Brigades.I am a Senior.I started to go
 when I was 5,now I am 13.The Girls    
 Brigade motto is{'Seek,Serve and      
{Follow Christ'.}Our chuch service     
 lasts for half an hour for children   
 but adults stay for 45 minutes.I enjoy
 family services at church because     
 mothers bring their children to join  
 in the service.
