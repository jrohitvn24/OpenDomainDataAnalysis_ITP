		<title>13APLEY ESTATE NR. KEMBERTON</title>
		<content>  The stock includes an annual turn    
 over of 800-900 beef cattle which are 
 sold direct to an abattoir in         
 Albrighton. There are 134 sows whose  
 piglets are kept until they are       
 weaners when they are sold to other   
 farms for fattening. There are 120    
 pedigree rams sold for breeding to    
 other farms and there are some        
 commercial sheep. 3,000 partridges are
 kept for a syndicate shoot.           
  The estate is farmed using a         
 traditional crop rotation of 1 year   
 and 3 year cycles which reduces the   
 need for large quantities of          
 artificial fertilizer. A variety of   
 machinery is used enabling only 16    
 full time labourers to be employed who
 all live on the estate. Casual labour 
 is employed at peak times.
