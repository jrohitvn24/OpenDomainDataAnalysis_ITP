		<content> The Lewes Road Sawmill in Scaynes Hill
 has been in operation since 1710.At   
 first it was a family business,now it 
 is owned by Cotswald Building ltd,the 
 manager is Mr T Budgen.It has 33      
 employees and uses 3 lorries.They buy 
 their wood from 2 or 3 importers and  
 use wood such as Canadian cedar and   
 Swedish wood which comes in a raw     
 state.From this he makes extensions,  
 sheds,chalets and greenhouses.The high
 grove chalet is the most popular      
 product.They do not export their goods
 although they used to.In the last year
 they have had 3 accidents but for 15  
 years before they had none.As they    
 store a lot of wood there is a great  
 fire risk so there are many hoses and 
 extinguishers.When they order wood    
 they state what size they want,they   
 get some in metres cubed and cedar    
 comes in standard(metric).            </content>
