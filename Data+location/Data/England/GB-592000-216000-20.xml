		<title>20OUR IMPRESSIONS OF L.MARNEY</title>
		<content> Although Layer Marney is only a few   
 miles from the large village of       
 Tiptree and from the town of          
 Colchester, nearly all the dwellings  
 are away from the main road. This     
 means that it is still very rural in  
 appearance and in reality. It has     
 little through traffic _ it is mostly 
 local, agriculturally connected,      
 commuter, or visitors to Layer Marney 
 Towers. There is a small boatbuilding 
 business specialising in fibre_glass  
 construction and an antiques fair is  
 sometimes held. Nearly all the people 
 we spoke to reported very little      
 village community life; the main      
 problem being a lack of a centre to   
 the village and no central meeting    
 place. About five years ago there was 
 a young mothers' group, but this does 
 not exist now.There are twisting lanes
 with some houses at the end of tracks.</content>
