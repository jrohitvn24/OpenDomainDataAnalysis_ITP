		<title>01Summary of a rural area</title>
		<content>This block is a lightly populated rural
area of the County of Warwickshire.It  
is situated south of Birmingham just   
N.W. of the town of Warwick.           
                                       
The area is surrounded by expanding    
conurbations. It is essentially still a
farming area but is also considered a  
very desireable place to live. Commu-  
ters are prepared to pay much higher   
prices to escape nearby town congestion
                                       
This block contains information on the 
mixing of:farmers viz commuters;       
original buildings viz modern          
expensive houses; and farming locally  
viz driving to work.                   
                                       
There is also general information on   
exactly what it is like to live here in
July 1985-from strawberry picking to   
driving BMW'S!                         </content>
