		<content> This is a farming area.The farms are  
 mainly Dairy and Beef.Recently,       
 however,farming has begun to          
 change.Dairy farmers have been        
 restricted by Milk Quotas and Beef    
 farming is no longer very profitable  
 because of high interest rates on     
 loans.So, many farmers are turning to 
 Arable farming, growing wheat, oats,  
 barley and maize.                     
 Frost farm is a typical farm in this  
 area.The man who own's the farm can't 
 afford to sell beef cattle,so he      
 started to grow crop's to supplement  
 his income. At present he has 42      
 bullock's.Frost farm is 17o acres of  
 land. The farm house was built in     
 1650.They have 25 chickens.Their      
 machinery includes 4tractors, 1forage 
 harvestor,1bailer and a sprayer  to   
 name just a few .
