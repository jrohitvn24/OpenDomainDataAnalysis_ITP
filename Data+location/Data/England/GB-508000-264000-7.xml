		<content> The young mother, who lives at the Old
 Post House,Wood End had moved from a  
 busy London Street. She liked the     
 quieter life and country. It was like 
 being on holiday living there. The    
 garden contained poppies, irises,     
 honeysuckle, pansies, forget-me-nots  
 etc. An old Turkey oak stands the     
 gate.                                 
 Her young children had a Playgroup at 
 the Village Hall.                     
 A bus stopped to take young school    
 pupils to Riseley and senior pupils to
 Sharnbrook.
