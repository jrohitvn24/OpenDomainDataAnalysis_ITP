		<content>   The home life of the majority of    
 villagers is the traditional English  
 way of life.Most households have a    
 married couple and their children,few 
 have grandparents living with         
 them.Most of the families live on The 
 Elms, a modern coucil estate which is 
 close to the school,Post Office,chapel
 and the church.Alongside The Elms is a
 group of Old Peoples Bungalows.       
  The family diet consists of          
 traditional simple foods cooked by the
 lady of the house. Most of the fresh  
 fare is grown in the gardens with the 
 fish and meat obtained from mobile    
 shops or in nearby towns. Bread and   
 cakes are baked in the village shop.  
  There is an annual village produce   
 show each July which demonstrates that
 the domestic and gardening skills are 
 still highly valued.
