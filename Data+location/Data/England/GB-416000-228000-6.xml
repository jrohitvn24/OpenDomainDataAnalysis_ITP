		<content> From newspaper advertisements during  
 the summer of 1985 average house      
 prices were discovered to be as       
 follows:                              
 1 bed. barn conversion - Â£42 000      
 2 bed. cottages - Â£49 000             
 3 bed. detached chalet-bungalows      
 modern construction - Â£58 000         
 3 bed. detched new cottages Â£65 000   
 Quarry House set in 8 acres of grounds
 -Â£250 000                             
 It is most unlikely that a young      
 couple could purchase a family home in
 the area other than a council house   
 for less than Â£55 000.There is a total
 absence of properties suitable as     
 starter homes.In fact the market &amp;    
 design of new homes in the area is    
 aimed at the upper end of the market  
 particularly retired people.Inevitably
 unless there is a drastic change in   
 policy the young will be forced out.  </content>
