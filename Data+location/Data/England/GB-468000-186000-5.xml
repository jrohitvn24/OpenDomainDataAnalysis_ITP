		<content>In our rectangle there are 5 pubs.     
The Bull Inn was built in 1301. The    
maximum people that can stay is 14.    
There is a design on the wall that     
was made in Jacobean times. There      
are some pudding stones which were     
markers for the ancient Britons.       
The Bull used to be a coaching inn.    
I don't know how old the Carpenters    
Arms is but it was there in 1882. The  
carpark used to be a garden and a      
pig sty.                               
The White Hart The White Hart is a     
hotel and was built in 1600. It has a  
restaurant and a garden.The other two  
pubs are called The Five Horse Shoes   
and the Sun.
