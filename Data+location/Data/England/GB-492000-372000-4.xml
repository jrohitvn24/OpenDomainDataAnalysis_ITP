 Ferry Lane starts at the Stones Arms  
 public house on the High Street in    
 Skellingthorpe village, and ends at   
 the Fossdyke. It is approximately one 
 and a half km long and runs eastwards.
 It is called Ferry Lane because there 
 used to be a ferry at the end to cross
 the canal but this is no longer the   
 case.                                 
 Most of the land on either side of    
 Ferry Lane is agricultural where      
 potatoes, corn and sugar beet is      
 grown. There is also a pig farm and a 
 field in which there are sheep and a  
 donkey. Also along the lane is a      
 sewerage works and a slaughter house.
