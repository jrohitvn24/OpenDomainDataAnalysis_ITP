		<content> In the past twenty-five years there   
 have been quite a few changes in the  
 area. The three main villages have    
 grown in size as it has become more   
 popular to live in a local village    
 instead of in the town. This has meant
 a great deal of change for our school 
 at St. Mewan. The increase in numbers 
 resulted in the school being enlarged 
 in two main phases adding many extra  
 classrooms to the school site.        
 The increase in the tourist trade has 
 meant a lot of extra traffic through  
 our area and the two main roads to    
 Truro and Newquay have been widened   
 and levelled. The village shops and   
 post offices have tended to suffer    
 because of this increased mobility and
 many have closed down. Some of the    
 Clay Pits have closed for economic    
 reasons but the sites are still used  
 for other purposes.       (Mike Yates)</content>
