		<title>12Things to do in Kirkby</title>
		<content> These are many different kinds of     
 entertainment in Kirkby. The sports   
 centre caters for most sports such as 
 football, weightlifting, squash and   
 many others. There was a cinema, but  
 this is now used for bingo. The       
 adults can also go to pubs and clubs. 
 The youngsters attend the many youth  
 clubs in the area such as Centre 63.  
 Here they play table tennis, pool,    
 football and have discos.             
 Some of the schools such as Ruffwood, 
 run clubs for their pupils. These     
 include weightlifting, photography and
 discos.                               
 The very young children attend the    
 cubs, brownies, guides and scouts.
