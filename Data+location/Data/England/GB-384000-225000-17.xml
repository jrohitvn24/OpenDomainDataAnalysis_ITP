		<title>17    LOCAL VIEWS AND ISSUES</title>
		<content>   The school took out a tape recorder 
 to record the views and attitudes of  
 people living in the area.            
 We asked one inhabitant if there was  
 any crime. He said no, but then added 
 that the church candlesticks had been 
 stolen 8 years ago. There were no     
 policemen at either place, and the    
 police house at Coombe Hill was closed
 3 years ago and the policeman sent to 
 Ashchurch near Tewkesbury. Some of the
 local people did not like visitors    
 because they thought they left        
 litter.The Gloucester Journal and the 
 Evesham Journal are local weekly      
 papers and some people take The       
 Gloucestershire Echo, an evening paper
 from Cheltenham. Most people had a    
 radio and/or television.{SEVERN SOUND}
 is a local  commercial radio station.
