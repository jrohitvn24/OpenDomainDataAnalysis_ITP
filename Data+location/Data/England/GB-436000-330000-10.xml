		<title>10Housing - Shelton Lock,Derby</title>
		<content> 300 years ago only one house stood in 
 Shelton Lock, then in the early 20th  
 century houses spread along the main  
 roads followed by a huge increase of  
 housing because of the development of 
 Rolls Royce and the railways.There is 
 about every kind of housing but mostly
 bungalows, modern terraces and        
 detached houses. The land was mostly  
 fields before the houses were built.  
 There are a few warden controlled     
 flats, an old people's home next to   
 Shelton Junior school and a children's
 home nearby. An OAP welfare centre is 
 in some new houses next to the Bridge 
 Inn. Because of the expansion of Derby
 there are a lot of new houses and     
 flats being built here.
