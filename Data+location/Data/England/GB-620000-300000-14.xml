		<content> Swainsthorpe, Swardeston, and Stoke   
 Holy Cross have their own parish      
 councils, Dunston being included with 
 the latter. Parish councils have very 
 limited powers but can levy a local   
 rate for very small things.           
 All the area falls within the area    
 administered by the South Norfolk     
 District Council. This deals with such
 matters as public health, refuse      
 collection, building and planning,    
 sanitary inspection and also rents out
 houses to people.                     
 Norfolk County Council administers the
 more major areas of health, education,
 highways and police, etc.             
 The area is included in the South     
 Norfolk Parliamentary constituency,   
 the member for whom is Mr John        
 McGregor, of the Conservative party.
