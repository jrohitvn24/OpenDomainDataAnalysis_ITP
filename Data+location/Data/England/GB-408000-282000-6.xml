		<content>We carried out a questionnaire survey  
into Home Life. We found that in our   
area most people had lived there for   
more than 8 years and knew their       
neighbours well. Milk is delivered to  
the door. Most famillies have one meal 
together at night, some eat take away  
food. English is spoken most, also     
Punjabi,Gujerati,Hindi and Bengali.    
Dogs were the most popular pets.       
  In the home men/boys are expected to 
do the decorating, gardening, car      
washing and general repairs. Women and 
girls are expected to do the washing,  
ironing, washing-up, baby sitting,     
cooking, cleaning the house and        
shopping.                              
  All homes surveyed had a television  
and all but one had a radio. One quarte
of the homes surveyed had a video.
