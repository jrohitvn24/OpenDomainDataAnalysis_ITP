		<title>06Noah's Ark Farm</title>
		<content> Our block is 56% rural and 44%        
 residential. Noah's Ark farm is a     
 typical  small farm in our block. The 
 farm we visited had 35 acres. They    
 keep 60 beef cows and sell them after 
 twelve months. On most farms the      
 busiest time is June and July with hay
 making. They have three stages of hay 
 making, cutting, tedding and baling.  
 In our block there are nineteen       
 different farms. Their animals eat    
 15,000 bales a year. They are highly  
 mechanized with two tractors, a       
 tedder, a baler, a sowing machine and 
 a cutter. When they first get their   
 calves at a week old they disbud      
 their horns by burning them out       
 completely. They used to keep 30 milk 
 cows but it was too much work with the
 milking in the evening and in the     
 morning.                              
                                       </content>
