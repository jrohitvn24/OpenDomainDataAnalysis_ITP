 The principal home of the English Red 
 deer is the Exmoor National Park      
 although there are herds on the nearby
 Quantocks and in the Lake District.The
 deer are born on a desolate part of   
 the moors such as the "Chains"in mid  
 June.The hind usually gives birth to  
 only one calf but twins have been     
 known.In October during the{rutting}  
 season the stags can be heard roaring 
 or{"bolving"}as they fight to maintain
 their ascendancy.The deer's natural   
 food includes wild plants but they    
 also consume farmers' crops and are a 
 pest.High fences are erected to keep  
 them out.Hunting with Staghounds is a 
 popular socisl activity which helps   
 control the deer though some think it 
 cruel.
