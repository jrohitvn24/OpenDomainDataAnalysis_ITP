		<title>08The Queen's Champion</title>
		<content> The Champion lives at Sonvelsby, a    
 scattered village and parish 2 miles  
 south of Horncastle. It has 153       
 inhabitants. 2142 acres are owned by  
 Sir Henry Dymoke, the Queen's         
 Champion. The park has an entrance    
 known as the Lion Gateway, a stone    
 arch with a rampant lion on top. It   
 was probably built by Sir Robert      
 Dymoke in the early 16th century.     
 There is no school or chapel or real  
 centre of Sonvelsby. It does not have 
 a Parish Council but a parish meeting 
 is held once a year. Robert Marmion   
 had the manor given to him by William 
 the Conqueror. When he died he left   
 the title and manor to his daughter   
 Joan who married John Dymoke. The     
 present lord of the manor is the 17th 
 Dymoke to live there. He is required  
 to go to Coronations only.
