		<title>07POLLUTION IN WHITTON</title>
		<content> The three commonest types of pollution
 in our area are noise fumes and       
 litter.                               
 The main sources of noise in our area 
 are aircraft, cars aand lorries. The  
 aircraft noise is so bad because we   
 live  only three miles from Heathrow  
 Airport which is one of the busiest in
 the world.Traffic noise is worst      
 near the busy Chertsey Road where     
 there is a constant flow of cars,     
 lorries and other vehicles. Traffic   
 also pollutes the air with harmful but
 invisible fumes. One form of pollution
 which is very common is litter. In    
 many roads you find sweet wrappers,   
 tins and  bottles even though litter  
 bins are provided. This is more of a  
 problem in Whitton High Street and    
 other main roads than in the quiet    
 residential streets.
