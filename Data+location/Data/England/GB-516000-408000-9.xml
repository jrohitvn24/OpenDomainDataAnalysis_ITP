		<title>09A KEELBY SATURDAY</title>
		<content> A normal Saturday morning for me is   
 that I would get up at half past 10   
 (because I am very lazy).I get down   
 stairs about 25 mins to 11 and watch  
 The Saturday Morning Picture Show     
 until quarter past 12.At about half   
 past 10 (the same time as me) my mum  
 and dad get up.If we all get up late  
 we have breakfast about quater past   
 11.For breakfast I normaly have a bowl
 of Rice Krispies and 1 or 2           
 crumpets.After breakfast I go back to 
 my bed-room and change out of my night
 clothes into my day clothes.          
 After dinner I normally have a game of
 tennis with Esme.Icome in about five o
 clock and have my tea which is usually
 a salad with fish.When I have finished
 my tea I watch the television.At about
 half past 7 an Ice cream van comes    
 round and I sometimes have an Ice     
 cream.                                </content>
