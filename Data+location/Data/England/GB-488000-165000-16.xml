		<title>16SWINLEY PARK, BRACKNELL.</title>
		<content>   The trees in{Swinley Park}are mainly
 coniferous, the area being a          
 plantation for the Sawmill.  Others   
 include oak and silver birch, some    
 more than 500 years old.  Near the    
 Sawmill{foresters}regularly fell the  
 smaller, weaker trees, and chop off   
 the lower branches to give the larger 
 trees more room to grow.  They use    
 chain saws and wear helmets, visors,  
 ear protection and thick, strong      
 gloves.                               
                                       
   Near the Sawmill there used to be   
{clay pits.} These were supplying      
 brick-works nearby.  Two cottages were
 knocked down in 1978 for the Sawmill  
 to be built.  These were on land      
 belonging to Blanes Farm and Blanes   
 Allotment.  In the centre of Swinley  
 Park are the{ruins}of a large house   
 with the remains of its garden.       </content>
