		<content>  The church's priory name is{Le Rice}.
 Inside the lynch gate there was a     
 plaque which said,"{Built in 1109.    
{Rebuilt by Norman Cooper.Born 1902,   
{died 1976.}"                          
  The church itself has still got its  
 very old door which is nine hundred   
 years old and was there in{Norman     
{times}.Before sailors went off to war 
 they would go to the church and with  
 their penknives they would make a line
 on the door. After the war,if the     
 sailors survived,they went back to the
 church and made another line so that  
 both lines made a cross. This was     
 a sign of thanks that God had guided  
 them safely through the war.          
  The church is quite big and at one   
 end of it there is a{spiral staircase.
 Under the stone floor in the church   
 there are people buried.
