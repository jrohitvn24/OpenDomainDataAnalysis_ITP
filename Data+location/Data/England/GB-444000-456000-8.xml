  Whixley Hospital was built in 1903 to
 1906.It was built on a Roman site     
 called a barfs.It was a sort of burial
 ground.It was built for inebriates but
 in the first world war it was used    
 for keeping soldiers.The patients they
 have are mentally handicapped.They    
 have 132 patients and 130 staff.In the
 day they learn to do art and craft.   
 Some people assemble ballbearings.    
 Others help staff make beds. They are 
 not locked in. The hospital may close 
 in about 8 years so that the inmates  
 can be in a community not a hospital. 
 The hospital owns some property in    
 Green Hammerton and Whixley.  They    
 have trees round the grounds for land-
 scaping.  Sometimes the patients go   
 on trips to Butlins or away with      
 relatives. The hospital is the biggest
 employer in the area.                 </content>
