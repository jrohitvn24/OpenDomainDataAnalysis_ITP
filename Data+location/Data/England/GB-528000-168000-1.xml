		<content> This Domesday Block comprises part of 
 each of Greater London Boroughs of    
 Merton and Croydon.  Its Northern     
 boundary at Streatham Common meets the
 outer southerly limits of Inner       
 London. The Block is quite a built-up,
 suburban area, though sprinkled fairly
 liberally with open common land and   
 parks.                                
 The houses in which people live vary  
 from estates of densely-packed        
 three-storied flats to spacious       
 Victorian dwellings that would have   
 housed families and many servants at  
 the turn of the Twentieth Century.    
 The area has a rich historical past - 
 with recorded information on certain  
 features dating back to the 13th      
 Century. There is a rich diversity of 
 ethnic background amongst the block's 
 population.                           
                                       </content>
