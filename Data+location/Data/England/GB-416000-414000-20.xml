 area, the smallest of 104 pupils and  
 the largest of 850. There are two     
{Roman Catholic}schools and one{Church 
{of England}school. All of the schools 
 are{comprehensive, mixed schools.}The 
 oldest was given its charter in 1608, 
 and the newest schools were built in  
 the 1970s.                            
    One school was used for housing    
 soldiers during World War Two. Another
 is a purpose built Middle School. The 
 smallest has six classrooms and five  
 teachers; the largest includes        
 laboratories, workshops, has fifty    
 teachers and a swimming pool on site. 
    Five schools worked together on the

{Juniors, Moldgreen Juniors, St        
{Joseph's Juniors and Lepton Middle
