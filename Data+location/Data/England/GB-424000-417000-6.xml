		<content>    At{Thornhill}there's a{park}called 
 the{Rectory Park.} It's quite a big   
 park.  There is a{golf course,}where  
 you can hire{clubs}and play golf.     
    Further down in the park there's a 
{lake.} People used to go{swimming}in  
 it, but it's{fenced off}now.          
    Thornhill's got a lot of hills, and
 the park is on a hill.  There's lots  
 of{trees}and{flower beds}all over the 
 park.  There aren't many things for   
 the{children}to play on, but there's  
 lots of{grass}to play{games}on.       
 People have{picnics}on the grass.     
 There's a{shop}nearby for sweets as   
 well.                                 
    If it starts to{rain}when you're at
 the park there is a{shelter}to go     
 under until it stops. There is a{car }
{park}which is{free}of charge.  There's
 also a block of{toilets,}which are    
 supplied with washbasins.             </content>
