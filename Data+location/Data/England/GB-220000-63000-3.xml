		<title>03POPULATION IN DOBWALLS</title>
		<content> DOBWALLS IS A SIZEABLE AND GROWING    
 SETTLEMENT.IN NOV. 1985 IT HAD A      
 POPULATION OF 1620.THERE IS PLANNING  
 PERMISSION FOR A FURTHER 90 DWELLINGS 
 GIVING AN ESTIMATED POPULATION FOR    
 1990 OF 1860.                         
  RETIRED PEOPLE USED TO MAKE UP THE   
 MAJORITY OF THE INHABITANTS. THERE IS 
 A COUNCIL SHELTERED HOUSING SCHEME,   
 AND MANY PRIVATELY BUILT BUGALOWS.    
 HOWEVER A NEW ESTATE, WHICH WHEN      
 COMPLETED WILL CONTAIN 160 DWELLINGS, 
 HAS THE FIRST TIME BUYER IN MIND.     
 THERE ARE NOW MANY MORE FAMILLIES,MANY
 WITH SMALL CHILDREN.                  
  SUCH A SHIFT IN AGE STRUCTURE HAS PUT
  PRESSURE ON THE RESOURCES OF THE     
 VILLAGE AND ALSO GIVEN HOPE FOR THE   
 FUTURE.FOR SOME THOUGH, SUCH RADICAL  
 CHANGES IN THE NATURE OF THEIR        
 COMMUNITY RESULTS IN TENSIONS SIMILAR 
 TO THOSE IN NEW TOWNS.                </content>
