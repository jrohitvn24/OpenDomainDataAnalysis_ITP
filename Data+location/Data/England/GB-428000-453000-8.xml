		<title>08 HOW HARROGATE IS CHANGING</title>
		<content> In recent years a conference centre   
 and conference centre hotel have been 
 built. Special events are organised to
 attract people at different times of  
 the year:The International Youth Music
 Festival (Easter),Spring Flower Show  
 (April), Yorkshire Show (July),       
 International Festival (July/August), 
 Antiques Fair(September). Harrogate   
 remains a popular place to visit.     
 Local opinion is divided over the     
 development of the town:many feel the 
 new conference centre;many are angry  
 over the building of a new superstore 
 near the town,which may cause traffic 
 problems; and many feel strongly that 
 the proposed northern bypass will     
 erode the green belt around the town. 
 Whilst the councillors are trying to  
 move with the times,some locals feel  
 the changes are making Harrogate a    
 less attractive place for visitors.   </content>
