		<title>02PEOPLE OF FELTWELL</title>
		<content>   Since 1960 many new houses have been
 built. People moved to Feltwell from  
 London, Hertfordshire and Essex (32%  
 of all the people we asked) Also many 
 Americans live on the base, some rent 
 houses in the village. 26% came from  
 the surrounding villages, 8% were born
 here.                                 
   We found that people moved to       
 Feltwell for several reasons. 28%     
 moved here for a better house, 46% for
 their job but 25% moved to Feltwell to
 retire. (many from London and Essex)  
 Some move here because it's cleaner   
 and quieter.                          
   Most Americans stay here for three  
 years but some leave the air force    
 and stay on. Most people who come to  
 Feltwell like it and stay for many    
 years.
