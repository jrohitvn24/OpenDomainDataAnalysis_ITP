		<content>    We found that many of the local    
 villages had an 'ing' as part of their
 name, such as Margaretting and        
 Ingatestone, and decided to try to    
 find out why. A large area SW of      
 Chelmsford, near the R. Wid, seems to 
 have been known as Gigingas, possibly 
 meaning the 'ing' of Gawo. 'Ing' seems
 to mean district or possession.       
    After the Norman conquest, the     
 districts were divided up and most    
 were identified by the new owners     
 name. Mountnessing came from the      
 Mounteney family (Mounteney's         
 ing);Ingatestone was probably Ing-at- 
 stone, which refers to the Roman      
 milestone and Fryerning is derived    
 from its association with the Knights 
 Hospitallers (The Hospital of St. John
 of Jerusalem) who held a small        
 possession there. Members of religious
 orders tended to be known as friars.  </content>
