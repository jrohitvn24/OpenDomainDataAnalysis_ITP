     {Minley Manor}is a house of       
 historical interest. It was built in  
 the 1860s by Raikes Currie, a wealthy 
 banker. He built it in a French       
 chateau style. Substantial alterations
 were made in the 1890s. The landscaped
 grounds include the spectacular       
 Wellingtonia and Lime Avenue, 500     
 yards long. The War Office bought the 
 Minley estate in 1936. Today it is    
 occupied by the Royal Engineers.      
 Public access is normally limited to  
 the annual events of the Fete and     
 Extravaganza.                         </content>
