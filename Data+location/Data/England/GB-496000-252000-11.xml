		<content> The village of Stevington can be      
 reached by road from three            
 directions,east,west and south.Public 
 transport consists of a bus service   
 which runs to and from Bedford five   
 times every day except Sundays.On the 
 main A.428 road buses run to Oxford,  
 Cambridge and Northampton calling at  
 intermediate villages.A large number  
 of families have one car,some have two
 and a few have three (but usually     
 belonging to grownup children).Pedal  
 bicycles and motorbikes are also      
 popular especially among the younger  
 people.Special buses transport the    
 children to schools in Bromham,Oakley 
 and Sharnbrook.
