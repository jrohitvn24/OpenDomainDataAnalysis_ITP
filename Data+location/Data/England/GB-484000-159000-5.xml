		<title>05The Arena Sports Centre</title>
		<content> In Camberley you can always find      
 something to do from swimming to going
 to the cinema. Quite a lot of the     
 facilities are well used, for example,
 the new{sports centre}- the Arena -   
 where you can go to swim, roller      
 skate, play badminton and squash or   
 to use the gym.                       
                                       
 Beside the sports centre is a{large   
{park}with an all-weather pitch for    
 football, rugby, hockey, and cricket. 
                                       
 Benches are situated around the park  
 for spectators. If the children get   
 bored whilst their parents are        
 watching the sport they can spend     
 their time in the children's play     
 area. In another part of the park     
 there are four tennis courts and a    
 nine hole putting green.
