		<content> 52 years ago St. Austell was mostly   
 fields and cultivated land,with very  
 few buildings.Extensive building has  
 taken place,mainly                    
 housing,particularly to the north of  
 the railway line. An increased        
 population has created extra traffic  
 and therefore more polution.          
 Mrs.Harris kept cattle,horses and     
 goats in her fields at Sandy Hill.    
 She has sold the fields and 130 houses
 are going to be built there.          
 There is a stream running through the 
 field.It is going to be protected for 
 future generations and a conservation 
 park will be constructed around it.The
 area contains rabbits,voles,hedgehogs,
 pigeons,slow worms and owls.There are 
 also holly blackthorn and beech trees.
