		<content> The underlying rock of the whole area 
 is clay of one type or another except 
 by the Fairham Brook which is river-  
 ine alluvium. Towards the W and NW is 
 grade 2 land, coarse loamy over clayey
 which has minor limitations that re-  
 duce the range of suitable crops or   
 interfere with cultivation (about 15% 
 of the block). The land either side of
 Fairham Brook is grade 4, waterlogged 
 blue-grey clay soil and liable to     
 flooding. Most of the block (75%) is  
 grade 3 land; around Wysall the under-
 lying rock is mixed chalky and reddish
 boulder clay which gives a loamy and  
 clayey soil, with a similar soil type 
 around Widmerpool. The area between is
 chiefly clayey and demands careful    
 management. There are no large woods  
 but several plantations of mixed trees
 totalling 5% of the area. The rest of 
 the block (3%) is residential.        </content>
