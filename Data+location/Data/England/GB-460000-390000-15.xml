		<title>15THE A.1 MOTORWAY</title>
		<content> Children at the C.of E. school wrote  
 to Nottinghamshire County Council and 
 to the Mininstry of Transport to find 
 out about the A.1 Motorway.They found 
 out that the motorway which is 15     
 miles long was built as a Bypass for  
 Doncaster between 1959 and 1961.The   
 cost of the road then was nearly Â£6   
 million and today the cost would be   
 far greater than that.The road was    
 built by a firm called                
 Cubbitt,Fitzpatrick and Shand under   
 the supervision of the County         
 Council.Some people know this road as 
 the Doncater Bypass and it is greatly 
 used today.
