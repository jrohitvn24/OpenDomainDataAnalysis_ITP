		<title>10FAMILY LIFE IN HASTINGS</title>
		<content>  There are many different life styles,
 but for a working family each morning 
 is busy. Most schools and industry    
 start between 8 and 9, so the day     
 starts about about 7. The family will 
 meet again in the evening when        
 probably the main meal will take      
 place. Entertainment may be watching  
 television or videos. Others may go   
 out to a pub or a club.               
  The family will relax more on the    
 weekend. Shopping, gardening, painting
 or sport will take up time. Saturday  
 night is the busiest night in the town
 centre.                               
  Religion is still important on Sunday
 but more and more entertainment and   
 trade is opening.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
