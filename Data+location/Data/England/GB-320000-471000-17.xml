		<title>17Guide celebrations cont.</title>
		<content> Our district commissioner saved the   
 candle until the next week when we had
 another celebration on Askam beach    
 with all the brownies and guides in   
 our district to pass on the birthday  
 candle.The guides collected fire wood 
 to build a campfire.They also made a  
 guide trefoil  in sand to put the     
 birthday candle in.The brownies had a 
 sand castle building competition while
 the guides were busy collecting       
 firewood.The sandcastle competition   
 was very hard to judge. There were    
 some very attractive ones.The winner  
 had shells on it,it was very good.    
 After the competion they played "silly
 games".Towards the end of the evening 
 we had a campfire and then tried to   
 light our birthday candles but it was 
 very windy so the candles blew out.   
 Even so every one enjoyed themselves.
