		<title>03BUILDINGS IN COLLINGHAM</title>
		<content> In the 1900's only a few buildings    
 stood in Collingham,the station which 
 was axed in 1963 was used to take     
 cattle and a post office was on       
 the main road.On Church Lane stood a  
 shop called 'Shack Affairs'which was  
 owned by Scotts of Harrogate.On the   
 Wetherby Road, where the Barley Corn  
 inn is now there used to be a cafe and
 near to this there used to be a camp  
 site.In the Old Star Restaurant there 
 were boxing fights on Friday nights.  
 Collingham has changed quite a bit,   
 there are new estates like Milbeck    
 Green and Delvar Close.Hastings court 
 has been built which is a parade of   
 shops.Oppisite the shops flats have   
 been built and a garden centre has    
 also been built near to the Old Star  
 Restaurant .Lady Hastings school has  
 been built recently so has the Doctors
 Sugery,also the Memorial Hall.        </content>
