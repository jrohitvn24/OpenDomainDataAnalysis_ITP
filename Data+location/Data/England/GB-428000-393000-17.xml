		<title>17VILLAGE ATTITUDES</title>
		<content> Many young people in this area think  
 that there is not enough to occupy    
 them,that the Youth club caters only  
 for young teenagers  and the public   
 house is the only place left. Night   
 clubs and Discos are to be found in   
 Sheffield but that is 7 miles away and
 late night transport is a problem.    
  The elderly in the area look back    
 with nostalgia,remembering the village
 as it was,small,stone built,where     
 every one knew each other and life    
 centred around the church,chapel or   
 school. The young parents would like a
 nursery school attached to            
 Oughtibridge,cuts in authority        
 spending prevent this. The middle aged
 residents are concerned by the        
 continual building of new dwellings in
 the area and the increase in traffic  
 on the main road.
