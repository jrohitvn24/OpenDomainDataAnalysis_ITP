		<content> Building thought to be about 150 to   
 200 years old and it has always been  
 public house as far as knowledge goes.
 it was part of Crayke estate, until it
 changed hands and was extensively     
 renovated in early 1960's. It has     
 changed hands three times since then..
 The land to rear of building and      
 outbuildings was used as stockyard.   
 The buildings have since been         
 developed to form self catering       
 cottages but retaining their original 
 structure. it was renovated in style  
 befitting its era and therefore is    
 quite an unusual establishment. It    
 takes residents in the tradition of   
 country inns and also serves real ale.
 It has a busy dining room to cater for
 the influx of visitors to the area and
 the changing eating habits of local   
 residents. Eventhough it attracts     
 visitors it forms the hub of village  </content>
