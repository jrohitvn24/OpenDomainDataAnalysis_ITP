		<content>             Culmstock appears in the  
 original Doomsday book as Culmstocha. 
 The present name translates as 'the   
 stock farm on the Culm'showing that in
 many ways it has changed little since 
 its Saxon origins for this is still a 
 farming area with land mainly given   
 over to grazing.                      
             The village itself has a  
 number of interesting features.Perhaps
 the most famous of these to outsiders 
 is the yew tree which grows on the    
 church tower.Thought to date from the 
 early l800s R.D. Blackmore ,who lived 
 in the village from l835 to           
 l84l,refers to it as part of his      
 boyhood memories.Although the         
 records of the church itself are      
 scanty it has Saxon origins and the   
 registers of Baptism,Marriages and    
 Burials date from 1645.
