		<title>19THE HESELTINE CRISIS</title>
		<content> The rural and unspoilt parishes of    
 Warfield and Binfield  are at present 
 under the threat of large scale       
 development which would completely    
 transform them. Michael Heseltine as  
 Minister of Environment endorsed a    
 plan to build 8000 houses in Central  
 Berkshire, 4000 in the Bracknell area.
 Locally the plan is known as          
 HESELTOWN.                            
 The Northern Parishes Action Group    
 (NORPAG) is leading the campaign      
 against the development. Patrick      
 Jenkin the present Minister of the    
 Environment and local M.P Andrew      
 Mackay became interested in the plight
 of these parishes, the latter gaining 
 the support of 86 M.P's in the        
 Commons. They have attracted the      
 public's attention to this problem    
 through use of the media.
