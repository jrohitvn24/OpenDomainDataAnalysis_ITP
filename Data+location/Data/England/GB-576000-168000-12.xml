		<title>12Shopping</title>
		<content> From our school window we can see a   
 variety of shops including a butchers,
 an electrical shop, a Co-op and a shoe
 shop.                                 
 Shopping is an essential part of      
 present day life because people shop  
 nearly every day. We haven't any      
 fields of our own and we need to buy  
 things from other parts of the        
 country, or from other countries of   
 the world. Gillingham's fields havs   
 been built on with many buildings.    
 I enjoy shopping very much. The best  
 bit I like about shopping is looking  
 at all the different things that I    
 like, but I don't like my Mum dragging
 me about which I hate. Shopping is    
 very local to  everyone (I like       
 shopping and I'm sure everyone else   
 does as well) in this part of         
 Gillingham.
