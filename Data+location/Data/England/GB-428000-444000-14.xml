		<title>14TYPICAL FARM-HAREWOOD AREA</title>
		<content>   The average size is 200 acres,of    
 mixed farming.Dairy cattle,pigs and   
 sheep are kept,the latter fattened for
 sale.Maize,wheat and barley are grown 
 for animal fodder.The land is GradeIII
 farming land,the soil being a medium  
 loam.The buying and selling of animals
 and other products is at Otley,Pannal 
 and Wetherby markets.The farmers work 
 from 6a.m.to 7p.m.with little manual  
 help.Machinery used includes tractors,
 drills,forage and combine harvesters. 
 Fertilisers are essential today,      
 mainly pesticides and fungicides.Over 
 the last decade farming has become big
 business and is one of Britain's most 
 essential industries.                 
   Most farmers were not in favour of  
 the proposed motorway through the area
 though some felt it was better to use 
 the poorer land here,than the GradeI  
 land on an alternative route.         </content>
