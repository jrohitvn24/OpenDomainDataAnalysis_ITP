		<title>02Nursery schools</title>
		<content> Nursery schools are education for     
 under fives.There are four nursery    
 schools in our area.They are situated 
 on the Chase,Kings Avenue,Slade Road  
 and York Road.They take under fives   
 only.Two of the schools take children 
 all day and two just half a day.They  
 play with pastry and sand and do a lot
 of activeties outside if the weather  
 is nice.They sing and play games like 
 lotto and dominoes.The nurseries get  
 the children ready for school.If you  
 dont book quickly into a nursery      
 school,you may be disappointed and you
 may have to wait a year or two because
 they are fully booked .They have easy 
 books in which the children have to   
 match the different shapes.
