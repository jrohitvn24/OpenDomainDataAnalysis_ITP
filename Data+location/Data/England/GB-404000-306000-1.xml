		<content>     Burntwood is an urban parish of   
3,719 acres, consisting of Chasetown,  
Chase Terrace and Burntwood.Adjacent is
the parish of Hammerwich. The parishes 
lie north of the Black Country and to  
the south of Cannock Chase.            
     Until the opening of the first    
coal pits in 1849, the population of   
approx. 700 was housed in the four main
hamlets of Burntwood, Edial, Woodhouses
and Hammerwich, and the main industry  
was nailmaking. The local coal industry
brought about a rapid population rise  
to over 8,000. Today there are approx. 
30,000 residents in the area.          
     The parish has good shopping      
facilities, a public library, 3 parks  
and a large recreation centre. There   
are also 10 churches of different      
denominations. Nearby, the Chasewater  
resevoir has become a favourite resort 
for water sports.                      </content>
