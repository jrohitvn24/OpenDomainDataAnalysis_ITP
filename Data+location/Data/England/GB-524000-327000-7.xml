		<title>07"Moby Dick"- The Chippy.</title>
		<content>      The name of our house is West    
 House.  The property has stood for    
 around 70 years.  We don't know too   
 much about the place because we have  
 only lived here a year.  We are also  
 new to the area (from Littleport).    
      At the beginning it was a grocery
 shop.  The road outside was a dirt    
 track but it is now a busy A 16 road. 
 Some years later,a lady bought it and 
 turned it into an antique shop.  It   
 has been a fish and chip shop for only
 two and a half years.  Mr.Walker had  
 it for eighteen months,then we came   
 along.                                
      It is a good business but very   
 hard work-a 24-hour a day job.  Still,
 we enjoy it very much.                
      Trade is very good throughout the
 year and the fish and chips are as    
 good as any in the neighbourhood.
