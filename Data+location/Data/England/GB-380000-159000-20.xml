		<title>20The Canal</title>
		<content>  The Kennet and Avon Canal runs       
 through our town and is a portion     
 ofthe Avon navigation which formed    
 part of a route from Bristol to       
 London. The canal fell into disuse    
 with the coming of the railway, the   
 decline of quarrying and the woolen   
 industry.                             
  Now the canal is being reborn. This  
 resurrection is a fantastic feat of   
 planning and organisation by          
 enthusiasts dedicated to re-opening   
 the sludged up, leaking, decrepit     
 canal. Already many pleasure boats    
 abound. They are mainly privately     
 owned, small, powered, cabin cruisers 
 and commercially run narrow boats     
 converted for passenger travel. The   
 canal is now an exciting growth area  
 and it has begun to live again.
