		<title>10Leisure activities.</title>
		<content>   There are a number of ways that     
 people can spend their leisure time in
 the local area.                       
   Most of the men in Chilton go to the
 'Chilton and Windlestone Working men's
 Club' in their spare time. Here they  
 can relax or play snooker or          
 billiards. The women can play Bingo in
 the club and on certain nights there  
 is a disco.                           
   Our local junior school is used by  
 the Community Association and is      
 called the Community College. On an   
 evening adults can go to the Social   
 Club here. If they like sport they can
 play such games as squash and         
 badminton. Cricket and football can be
 played on the field at the back of the
 College.                              
   Jogging and walking are popular     
 pastimes as is allotment gardening.
