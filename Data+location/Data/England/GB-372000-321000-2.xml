		<content> WAS MAINLY MOSSES AND LEAF LITTER.    
   UNDER THE CANOPY OF AN OLD BEECH    
 TREE, WHICH COVERED AN AREA OF ABOUT  
 THREE HUNDRED SQUARE METRES, WE FOUND 
 THAT SUNLIGHT WAS ABLE TO PENETRATE   
 DOWN THROUGH THE BRANCHES AS SHORT    
 GRASSES, MOSSES AND WOOD SORREL WERE  
 ABLE TO GROW. SOME HONEYSUCKLE WAS    
 ALSO GROWING  ALONG THE EDGE OF THE   
 CANOPY. AMONG THE SOFT SPONGEY LAYERS 
 OF BEECH MAST AND LEAF LITTER WERE    
 DIFFERENT FUNGI SHOWING THAT IT WAS   
 DAMP. SPIDERS, ANTS AND WOODLICE WERE 
 SEEN UNDER DEAD BARK. UNDER AN OAK    
 TREE CANOPY WERE OAK SAPLINGS,        
 BRAMBLES AND ELDER ABOUT ONE METRE    
 HIGH, TOGETHER WITH NETTLES FOXGLOVES 
 AND GRASSES. ON THE GROUND WERE DEAD  
 LEAVES AND ACORNS, TWIGS AND RABBIT   
 DROPPINGS. EVIDENCE OF MAN IN THIS    
 PART PART OF THE WOOD WAS SHOTGUN     
 CARTRIDGES AND TRUCK TRACKS.          </content>
