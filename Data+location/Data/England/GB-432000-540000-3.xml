		<content>      Some birds are very big and some 
 are small. Some birds hunt for food   
 like owls, sparrow hawks, and herons. 
 Some people like birds and some do not
 like birds. Farmers do not like crows 
 because they eat their crops. Some    
 farmers shoot the crows and rooks.    
 When the farmers are ploughing their  
 fields, the crows and Rooks Land      
 behind the tractor to feed on the     
 freshly disturbed ground creatures.   
      The area's most common wild birds
 are the sparrows, magpies, rooks,     
 starlings, and thrushes. There are    
 still many hedgerows in the area, and 
 these support a wide variety of bird  
 life.                                 
      The ornithologist Lofthouse made 
 an extensive collection of birds of   
 the area. Many of these are preserved 
 and cared for by the County Museum    
 Service.                              </content>
