		<content>   Lassington Court and Astman's Farm  
 lie north of Highnam. Astman's was in 
 the original Domesday Book and is     
 today a dairy farm. In recent years   
 Lassington Court has changed to       
 specialise in dairying also.Both farms
 rely on family labour;three           
 generations working at Lassington,    
 whilst at Astman's the problem of     
 labour has resulted in the farmer     
 adjusting his operation and acreage   
 to match his own desired workload.    
   Such operational changes reflect    
 responses to the changing economic    
 climate but may leave recent          
 buildings and equipment unused or     
 underused.
