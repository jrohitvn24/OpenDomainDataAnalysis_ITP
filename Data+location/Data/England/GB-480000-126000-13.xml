 at haslemere and the other at liss.   
 the eldest boy is at hollycombe school
 while the 3 year old attends the local
 playgroup twice a week. the garden is 
 mostly lawn surrounded by a shrubury  
 giving plenty of play area. we have a 
 allotment near the pottery for growing
 vegetables. we are involved in the

 field committees. regular shopping is 
 done at shottermill or petersfield,   
 with guildford or chichester for major
 items. our milk is delivered by       
 milland dairies. we enjoy local events
 such as school sports day, the barn
