		<content> POLICE CONSTABLE POWELL lives in the  
 POLICE HOUSE in the village and keeps 
 the peace.He is popular and enjoys    
 being part of the community.He is     
 occasionally called out to bad crimes 
 but on the whole it is a peaceful     
 area.There are one or two young people
 of between 14 and 17 years of age who 
 get frustrated with little to do in   
 the village and who look for trouble  
 but really there is little CRIME.There
 are about 2 MOTOR ACCIDENTS a week to 
 which P.C.POWELL is called.It is too  
 large an area for a BICYCLE PATROL so 
 a police van equipped to set up road  
 blocks and mark off roads is          
 used.Partridge Green is a WAR DUTY    
 STATION with a NUCLEAR ALARM SYSTEM   
 connected to the fire station.
