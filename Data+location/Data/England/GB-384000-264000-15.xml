		<title>15SCHOOL LIFE AT SYTCHAMPTON</title>
		<content> The children usually go on school     
 trips in the summer. Parents come in  
 to teach games: football in the       
 winter, cricket and tennis in the     
 summer. The school also has many      
 fund-raising events such as car-boot  
 sales, jumble sales, summer fetes and 
 coffee mornings. The parent teachers  
 Association helps with these events.  
 At Christmas the children put on a    
 concert for people to come and watch. 
 Many old ladies come to watch but they
 also have a long chat about what they 
 did when they were at school. The     
 children start school at four and a   
 half years of age and they leave      
 school when they are nine. The lessons
 begin at 9.20 and they finish at      
 3.00pm. They have lunch at twelve.
