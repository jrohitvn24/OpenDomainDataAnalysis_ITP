 a) Local      17 people               
 b) 5 miles     6 people

       _____CONCLUSIONS_____           
                                       
     AFTER LOOKING AT THE RESULTS, I   
 CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT MOST      
 PEOPLE CAME TO THE COMMON TO WALK OR  
 EXERCISE THEIR DOGS.   MOST CAME      
 BECAUSE THEY LIVE NEARBY.  THE        
 MAJORITY CAME 2 OR 3 TIMES A YEAR.    
 MORE THAN HALF OF THE VISITORS LIVED  
 LOCALLY.                              
     THIS CONCLUSION IS PARTICULAR TO  
 THESE TWO DAYS.  AT OTHER TIMES THE   
 RESULTS MIGHT BE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.
 I WAS SURPRISED THAT 3 PEOPLE HAD     
 TRAVELLED 20 MILES TO THE COMMON.     </content>
