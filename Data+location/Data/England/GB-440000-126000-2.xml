		<title>02A History Of The Farm</title>
		<content>  Centuries ago ,{Hays Wharf}, a London
 company made a good living on the     
 south bank of the River Thames . But  
 this business came to an end , and    
 they sold land near London Bridge .   
 With the proceeds they bought some    
 farms , one of them was the{Hursley   
{Park Estate}, just south of this area.
 It was built in 1801 by the Cooper    
 family . Hays Wharf thus became a     
 Property Company . In 1974 they were  
 taken over by{St.Martins Property     
{Corporation}, and a year later this   
 became a subsiduary of the{Kuwait     
{Investment Office}. Even though the   
 land now belongs to Arabs , the same  
 man runs it as when it was owned by   
 Hays Wharf . It is used as a livestock
 and arable farm .
