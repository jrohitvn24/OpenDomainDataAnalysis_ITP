		<content> From wherever you stand in the        
 villages you notice how flat the land 
 is and how the roads have been raised 
 on banks to stand some three or four  
 metres above it.The land is disected  
 by dykes.There is very little woodland
 but the major kind of tree is Oak.The 
 fields are large and the majority     
 still have hedges to mark their       
 boundary.The fields contain much      
 natural wildlife and the poacher is a 
 person who still exists today.The     
 landscape is spoilt by an electricity 
 sub_station which stands on the       
 outskirts of Walpole St.Peter and is  
 visible for a number of miles.The     
 outstanding  feature however as one   
 travels towards the villages is in the
 church tower of Walpole St.Peter      
 church and the trees that surround it 
 and the rectory.
