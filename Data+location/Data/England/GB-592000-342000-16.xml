   I get up about 7.30 a.m. to go to   
school and put on my school uniform    
which is a grey skirt, blue shirt and  
blue jumper.  For breakfast I have     
Frosties and a drink of lemonade.      
   School lessons start at 9.10 a.m.   
but before I go to school I take my dog
for a walk.  At half past ten we have a
15 minute break and then stop for      
dinner at 11.55.  In the afternoon     
school lasts from 1 to 3.30 p.m.       
   After school I change into my jeans,
then either play swingball with the    
lads next door or go to the shop for   
some groceries before 7 p.m. as it     
closes then.  Before going to bed at   
10 p.m. I watch T.V.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
