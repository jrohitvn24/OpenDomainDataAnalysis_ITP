		<title>17COAL REPLACES PEAT</title>
		<content> The reasons for the decline, were the 
 opening of the new collieries whose   
 coal was more efficient for burning   
 than peat, the opening of the         
 Stainforth and Keadley canal, which   
 partly destroyed the boating dykes and
 meant payment of dues on the overland 
 carriage of peat to the River Don.    
 Finally the enclosure act, although   
 preserving the peat on Thorne Waste,  
 accelerated moorland reclamation and  
 peat working waned. The use of peat as
 a fuel also declined, but the trade   
 revived in the 1880's as the peat was 
 used as animal litter, especially as  
 bedding for horses.                   
   In 1899, 120 Dutchmen were employed 
 on Thorne Waste working for           
 the Griendtsreen company who had the  
 peat trade on Thorne Waste. The Peat  
 Moors Litter Company took over from   
 Grievst.                              </content>
