 The Alpha Gallery,opened 18 months ago

 with the owner selling her own hand   
 painted furniture and slowly expanded 
 as other artists and craftsmen        
 appeared.Now the gallery sells the    
 work of{artists from Somerset and     
{Dorset.}Objects include{paintings,    
{pottery,glassware,carvings,sculpture, 
{jewellery,smocked and knitted garments
 all of high quality.Prices range from 
 a few pounds for a silver necklace to 
 several hundred pounds for a bronze.  
   Village people are also active.There
 is a{sculptor,a musical instrument    
 maker, a maker of{stained glass,}an   
{embroideress}of high standing,several 
 talented{flower arrangers}and an      
{active handicraft group}in the Women's
