		<title>17A FAMILY WEEKEND 1</title>
		<content> On Saturday I got up at about 8.30.   
 I got washed and dressed and went     
 downstairs for my breakfast which Mum 
 had cooked.We had:                    
 Cereal(Corn Flakes)and Bacon and Egg. 
 I watched the Saturday morning TV show
 until about ten which had music and   
 cartoons.I had to go out then to the  
 Community College to pay for the      
 events in the Summer Playscheme I     
 wanted to go in for.I found my Mum had
 to sign the sheet so it was back home 
 again.Got it done eventually.         
 My friend called around and we went   
 into the town(Kingsbridge).We looked  
 in all the shop windows for the       
 'odd-objects' competition which is    
 part of the 'Fair Week'.              
 Back at home we had a 'Veal and Ham'  
 pie for lunch.I did the washing up    
 with my Dad.He usually works on Sat., 
 he's a plumber) but he had today off. </content>
