		<title>05THE VILLAGE SCHOOL</title>
		<content>  We go to{Sir John Moore}School.There 
 are three teachers and 69 children    
 between the ages of 5 and 11.         
 As a pupil I like the school very much
  There is an infant class,a lower     
 junior class and upper junior class   
 which I am in.The school was built in 
 1697 and is one of the oldest in      
 Leicestershire.                       
  We have very different lessons,Maths,
 English,Topic (history and geography),
 Quest(R.E.), Spelling Workshop,Reading
 Workshop,Art, Music, Games,and Science
  The main room is the hall.We have    
 assembly and games in there. Near that
 is the art room where we do art,sewing
 and pottery.On the other side of the  
 hall is my classroom and the library  
 where we also have{television}and the 
{computer.}The lower juniors are in a  
 mobile classroom outside and the      
 infants classroom is behind the hall. </content>
