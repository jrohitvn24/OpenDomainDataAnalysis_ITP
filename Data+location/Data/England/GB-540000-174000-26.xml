<title>26A day in a life</title>
<content>

On Saturday morning I woke up and put on my slippers and dressing gown, and went down stairs. I still felt a bit tired. I had my breakfast and then got dressed.&lt;br />&lt;br />I went to Sidcup with my mum and dad to see the Saturday School I may go to. I felt a bit nervous when I got there. &lt;br />&lt;br />We went back home to pick up my brother and then we went to Bromley. When we got there it was it was pouring with rain so we waited 10 minutes and then got out of the car. I thought there was going to be a flood. &lt;br />&lt;br />After doing shopping I went to my Grandmaâ€™s. We had some dinner and then left to go home.&lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
