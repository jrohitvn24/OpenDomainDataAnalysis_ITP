 IN 1897,AND THE LAST TRAIN RAN ON JUNE
 7,1963. THE OLD STATION AT BLAGDON CAN
 STILL BE SEEN NEXT TO THE RESERVOIR.  
 IT IS NOW A PRIVATE HOUSE.THE PLATFORM
 IS STILL THERE AND YOU CAN SEE THE OLD
 LIGHTS AND THE WAITING ROOM.          
    AT BURRINGTON YOU CAN SEE THE      
 STATION MASTER'S HOUSE AND NEXT TO    
 THAT THE OLD RAILWAY BRIDGE. THE      
 STATION HAS GONE COMPLETELY BUT YOU   
 CAN SEE WHERE THE TRACK TURNS A       
 CORNER. IF YOU GO UNDER THE BRIDGE YOU
 CAN STILL SEE THE SMOKE MARKS ON THE  
 ROOF. THE NEARBY BRIDGE THAT THE      
 TRAINS WENT OVER WAS BUILT IN ABOUT   
 1860.                                 
    THE RAILWAY WAS USED TO CARRY      
 FREIGHT SUCH AS MILK AND CATTLE BUT IT
 ALSO CARRIED PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY     
 DAYTRIPPERS.IT WAS CLOSED DOWN IN 1963
 WHEN IT BECAME TOO EXPENSIVE TO RUN.  </content>
