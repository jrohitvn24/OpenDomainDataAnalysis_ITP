		<title>06NEWHAVEN TOWN'S PROSPERITY</title>
		<content> There are 4 banks, Lloyds, Midland,   
 Nat. West and Barclays, and 3 building
 societies, Leeds Permanent, Woolwich  
 and Nationwide.  The town obtains     
 money from the cargo boat fees and    
 this prosperity is growing.  Types of 
 cargo include citrus fruit, grapes,   
 potatoes, tomatoes, oranges, meat.    
 Unfortunately more businesses have    
 closed down in recent years than have 
 opened.  When Vacco, Fergusons and    
 Shopper's Paradise closed many people 
 lost jobs.  The largest employer is   
 Parker Pen Company.                   
 New businesses have opened on Denton  
 Island, making VCRs and computer      
 components.  The area's prosperity    
 depends on the harbour attracting     
 cargo boats, the continuation of the  
 Dieppe Ferry service, fishing, influx 
 of new light industry and the success 
 of the new shopping precinct.         </content>
