		<content> Westleigh is a large house which      
 stands in 10 acres of grounds.6 acres 
 are owned by the Lancashire C.C.and 4 
 by the Regional Health Authority.The  
 house is used as a disaster planning  
 headquarters and sits on top of a     
 nuclear bunker.Westleigh makes plans  
 for peacetime disasters such as Rabies
 outbreaks,flooding,oil pollution,     
 industrial emergencies and the Heysham
 Nuclear Power station if anything     
 should go wrong.In wartime it would   
 become a nuclear bunker which would   
 become the control centre for the     
 Lancashire area of Region 10          
 (Lancashire,Cumbria,Greater           
 Manchester,Merseyside and the I.O.M)  
 The Lancashire region has a standby   
 headquarters near Lancaster and 12    
 other district centres, 363 community 
 centres and 10 mobile units.{
