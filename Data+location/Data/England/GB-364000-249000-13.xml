		<content> This block is within the area         
 administered by the Avenbury Parish   
 Council, which in turn, is answerable 
 to the Malvern Hills District Council,
 in the county of Hereford and         
 Worcester. Services for this area are 
 concentrated in Malvern, though there 
 is a local office in Bromyard.  The   
 parish council has worked hard and due
 to their pressure there is a mains    
 water supply (under the control of the
 Welsh Water Authority), electricity,  
 sewerage, and a fortnightly refuse    
 collection. In this area there are    
 three justices of the peace, one of   
 whom sits on two benches.  The area is
 well sign-posted.
