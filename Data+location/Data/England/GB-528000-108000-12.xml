		<content>  This information that the shops exist
 because they provide for day to day   
 needs which would not justify a       
 journey to Brighton Town Centre.      
{HOLLINGBURY.}The houses of Hollingbury
 are mainly council homes although some
 have been bought.They are nearly all  
 semi-detached houses with modest      
 gardens.They are built out of red     
 brick although some have been         
 plastered over and others painted.Not 
 many houses had garages although      
 garages could be rented.              
{WESTDENE.}The houses nearer Eldred    
 Avenue are the oldest part of         
 Westdene.This area was built in the   
 1930's.The houses have a part timber  
 frontage.Higher up nearer Westdene    
 school the houses were built in the   
 1960's.Bungalows and two story houses 
 surround the area,usually brick and   
 replacement windows.                  </content>
