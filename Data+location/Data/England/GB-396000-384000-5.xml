		<content> The pollution in New Mills/Disley area
 is bad.When people eat a packet of    
 crisps they just throw the empty      
 packet on the floor.There is a        
 fine of Â£50 if you throw litter on the
 floor.The rubbish that people dump    
 everywhere is disgraceful.There should
 be more bins around New Mills.        
 The stream near our school is full of 
 wood,metal,tyres and it looks an      
 awful sight.There should be a few     
 skips in New Mills.If people have     
 rubbish that won't fit in the dustbin 
 they should ask the dustbin men to    
 collect it.The River Sett is polluted 
 with dye caused by the mills and the  
 fish are killed because of this.On the
 A.6.road there is a lot of car fumes  
 and noise this affects the people who 
 live near there.
