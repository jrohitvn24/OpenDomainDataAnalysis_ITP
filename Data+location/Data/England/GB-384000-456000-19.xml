		<title>19Hellifield Playing Field</title>
		<content>    In 1979 Hellifield Parish Council  
 were approached to provide land and   
 facilities for village recreation.    
 Several abortive attempts had been    
 made since 1924.                      
    A piece of derelict land was leased
 from Craven District Council in 1980  
 and a Management Committee of 7       
 villagers coopted.Over Â£1000 has been 
 raised annually to maintain and equip 
 the field,after clearance by the      
 villagers.                            
    The long term plan is to provied   
 children's adventure equipment,tennis 
 court,bowling green,and pavilion      
 /social club.The wooden play equipment
 ,seating and field oven/barbecue have 
 been produced by village craftsmen and
 local school children. Mowing and     
 other maintenance is done voluntarily.
 Much use has been made of second_hand 
 and donated materials.                </content>
