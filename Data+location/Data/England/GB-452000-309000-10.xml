		<title>10THE ANSTEY GALA.</title>
		<content> In August there is nearly always a {  
{Gala}. It starts off with a big       
 parade. In it are 3 bands all wearing 
 different costumes. There are a lot of
 floats and near the very back of the  
 parade in a green truck there is {The 
{Anstey Gala Queen}with her 2          
 attendants. She sits on a throne and  
 above her she has a decorated hoop.   
 The paradegoes all the way round      
 Anstey and back to the recreation     
 ground. There are stslls and sometimes
 there is an open top mini_bus. If the 
 weather is really nice the gala has a 
 bouncy castle and a Tug_of_War        
 competition.                          
 Everyone has a great time.
