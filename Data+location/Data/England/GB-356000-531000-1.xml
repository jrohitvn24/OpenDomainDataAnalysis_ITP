		<content> Langwathby is on the western side of  
 the Pennines.Edenhall is on the west  
 side of the river. It is a beautiful  
 area with wide views over the hills to
 the Lake District.The word "wath"means
 ford and this was a crossing place    
 before there was a bridge.The river at
 Langwathby is fairly wide and shallow.
 It is noted for fishing.We can catch  
 salmon,brown trout,sea-trout,eels and 
 grayling.There are lots of river birds
 water-hens,herons,swans and ducks. We 
 see the swifts and swallows diving for
 flies resting on the surface of the   
 water.We sometimes see mink.There are 
 not many holiday cottages in the      
 villages which makes it easier for    
 local people to stay here.There is a  
 very special wind called the Helm.It  
 is a strong gale blowing in from the  
 Pennines.It has a dense,white cloud   
 bar along the top of the Pennines.    </content>
