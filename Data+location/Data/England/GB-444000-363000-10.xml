		<title>10TRANSPORT IN HARDWICK</title>
		<content>  Only{Hardstoft}and{Glapwell}were     
 reported as being served by{public    
{transport.}These{bus services}earned  
 comments ranging from "good" to       
 "erratic". For a large number of the  
 population the nearest bus-stop is    
 between two and four miles away. A    
{school bus service}does operate in the
 area, the nearest schools being at    
{Heath}and{Bramley Vale.               
  Taking into account the lack of      
 public transport, it comes as no      
 surprise that almost all the residents
 own, or have access to, a{car.}This   
 then is the primary mode of transport 
 and is essential for those employed   
 outside the area.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
