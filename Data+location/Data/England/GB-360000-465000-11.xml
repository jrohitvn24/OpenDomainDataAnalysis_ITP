		<title>11Samantha's Day, Wray</title>
		<content> I woke at 8 a.m. and went downstairs  
 for breakfast of cereal, toast and    
 coffee. I had my hair brushed and put 
 into a long plait. It only took me a  
 few minutes to walk to school. At     
 school we had assembly, then went to  
 our desks to do some maths. At break, 
 we played Robin Hood.                 
 After playtime we worked on our heart 
 projects. For dinner, we had sausage  
 rolls and chips. At 12.55 a taxi came 
 to take three of us to guitar lesson  
 at Hornby Primary School. Back at     
 school later we did English until     
 playtime when I worked on the         
 computer. Afterwards Mrs Blackwell    
 read from 'The Poacher's Son'.        
 After school, I went with Dawn to our 
 den in Spout Wood. After tea, I played
 tennis at Dawn's. When I went home, I 
 had a bath and then watched television
 until bedtime at 8.30.                </content>
