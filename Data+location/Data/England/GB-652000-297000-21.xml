<title>21Corton Church</title>
<content>

In 1986 the vicar was Chair of Governors of Corton School. he reported his early reception in the church was not well received (he was a socialist). Some of the parishioners at his first sermon in the church tried to shout him down and asked him to leave. Apparently this was a local Corton tradition which was known as "vicar bating! and had been particularly prevelant during the 1960s"&lt;br />&lt;br />He survived this unauspicious beginning and faced down this minority of parishioners - going on to be a popular village clergyman of Corton.&lt;br />
