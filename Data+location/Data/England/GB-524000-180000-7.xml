		<title>07Maida Vale</title>
		<content>A residential area crossed by very     
broad tree lined avenues,as in the case
of Elgin and Sutherland Avenues.These  
Avenues are lined by large,end of the  
19th century buildings broken up into  
flats.                                 
Paddington Recreation Ground is one of 
the few grassed areas in this locality.
It also has swings and roundabouts,a   
very small flower garden,a cycle track 
and tennis courts,and a newly built all
-weather playing surface for ball      
games.                                 
the B.B.C. Studio,Maida Vale,which is  
much used for music recordings,is in   
Delaware Road.                         
Overall the East side of this block is 
more "gentrified",more like St.John's  
Wood over the Edgeware Road;while the  
Western side is more cosmopolitan,more 
definitely North Paddington.
