		<content> Longfield does not have a hospital of 
 its own;residents must go to either   
 Dartford or Gravesend. The nearest    
 casualty department is at West Hill   
 Hospital,Dartford. Many residents are 
 in a position to afford private health
 care and there is a private hospital a
 few miles away in Fawkham.            
 Primary health care is provided from  
 within Longfield by General           
 Practitioners. Attached to these      
 doctors are nurses,and health         
 visitors,                             
 who visit patients in their own homes.
 The National Health Service funds the 
 hospitals and provides the doctors and
 nurses. Prescription charges are      
 currently Â£2.00 per item.             
 Prescriptions are dispensed by the    
 chemists in Station Road.
