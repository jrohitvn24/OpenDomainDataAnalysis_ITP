		<title>03THE VILLAGE OF HATT</title>
		<content> This village has grown from nothing.  
 The land was purchased by a speculator
 who has developed it for housing over 
 the last twenty years.Future plans are
 delayed by a sewage embargo.          
 Hatt is populated by retired people   
 and commuters,the latter working in   
 the Navy or Devonport Dockyard.       
 The only shop is a Post Office selling
 stationery and limited foodstuffs.The 
 garage on the A388 has an Austin/Rover
 franchise and sells petrol and does   
 repairs.                              
 Most children aged 5-11 go to Landulph
 School while those aged 11+ travel by 
 bus to Saltash or Callington
