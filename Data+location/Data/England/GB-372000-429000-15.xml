   The largest employer in the area is 
Joseph Arnold of Bridge Street Works,  
Church. Originally started in 1903 as a
small family printing firm over a      
grocer's shop, it moved first to       
Oswaldtwistle and then to the present  
site. Still expanding, a new four      
storey development was officially      
opened by Princess Diana in 1983.      
   Today 970 people are employed,      
fairly evenly divided between men and  
women, over the full age range. 250 of 
these work a four hour evening shift.  
   Over 60 million greetings cards are 
produced each month as well as numerous
gift products and wrappings. The cards 
are printed in English, French and     
German with a large proportion being   
exported.
