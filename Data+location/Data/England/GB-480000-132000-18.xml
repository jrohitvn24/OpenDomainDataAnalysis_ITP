		<content> Our immediate area is one of elderly  
 people. We do not have the security of
 young people next door or across the  
 way to call upon in a crisis. We are  
 self-reliant folk. We are not the     
 village people at all, we mostly come 
 from London. However, we take part in 
 village activities with enthusiasm,   
 rather dividing the community into    
 two, the true villagers and the       
 'foreigners'. How did this happen?    
 Probably because of tempting bungalows
 advertised in London. It is fine at   
 first for the newly pensioned couples;
 good gardens and allotments near at   
 hand for Dad and many activities for  
 Mum to join. But time, and perhaps one
 of the couple, passes on and the      
 garden becomes a burden rather than a 
 pleasure. So they leave the village   
 and the area becomes one of constant  
 change.                               </content>
