		<content> Mr Sapsford's hobby is doing up old   
 cars.He was born in Hankham but his   
 family haven't always lived           
 there.A change that Mr Sapsford hads  
 noticed is that there is a lot more   
 houses used to be.House is only 21    
 years old,he built it near the Nursery
 because of his old job at the         
 Nursery.He goes shopping at langney on
 average once a week.His cars been in  
 films such as "sherlock holmes",he has
 a ROLLS ROYCE and a bently and he     
 sometimes uses them for weddings.One  
 of the noticeable events recently has 
 been the wedding at Mr and Mrs        
 Glessings house.Another is the        
 argument over thew Pevensey-by-pass.He
 doesn't rely on a bus service and if  
 there was a village shop he would     
 definatly use it.He has always been   
 interested in engernearing so that is 
 why he began on old cars.             </content>
