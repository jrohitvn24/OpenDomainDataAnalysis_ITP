		<title>09The Village Postmaster.</title>
		<content> Mr.Lord owns the only Post Office in  
 our area. He opens at 9.00am and      
 closes at 12.00 noon for lunch, then  
 re-opens at 2.00pm and closes for the 
 night at 5.30pm. Unlike most places   
 his half day closing is on Tuesday .  
 His Post Office is  nearly opposite   
 the pub.They bought the Post Office in
 1971. The other things on sale include
 confectionary, groceries, sweets, ice 
 creams and some shoes and clothing. We
 thought it might be difficult for him 
 to get enough time for a holiday so we
 asked him, " How do you arange your   
 holidays? " and he said, " Well, we   
 have to arange our holidays when we   
 can get someone to act as relief for  
 us." We don't think he gets many      
 holidays.
