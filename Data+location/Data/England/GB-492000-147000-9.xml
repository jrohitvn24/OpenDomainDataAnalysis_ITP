		<title>09THE MARWICK HALL PUTTENHAM</title>
		<content> Before 1959 the village used the old  
 school (replaced in 1903) as a{village
{hall.}It was small and became very    
 dilapidated and Miss Jean Marwick     
 offered land for a new hall.          
                                       
 Nine sponsors contributed a third of  
 the money needed and after help from  
 the Ministry of Education, the village
 raised the rest either by subscription
 or by holding fetes, dances, jumble   
 sales etc.                            
                                       
 When Miss Marwick died her executors  
 carried out her wishes and so the hall
 was named after her. It has three     
 times won the trophy for the Best Kept
 Village Hall in the competition held  
 by the Surrey Voluntary Service       
 Council.                              
                                       
                                       </content>
