		<content> Every year in July we have a carnival 
 called Dicker Day when people come    
 from Upper and Lower Dicker and the   
 surrounding areas.The procession of   
 floats assembles at Michelham Priory  
 and travels through the village to the
 village field.I was to be king for a  
 day. There were lots of tractors and  
 trailers waiting to be judged.As we   
 approached the field we saw hundreds  
 of people lining the road.The queen   
 and I opened the fete together and    
 drew the tickets for the raffle.It was
 an enjoyable day and I felt very      
 royal.
