		<title>09SALTBURN SEAFRONT &amp; TOURISM</title>
		<content> In recent years Saltburn's seafront   
 has become more popular appealing more
 to day trippers than long stay holiday
 makers.Chalets are available along the
 seafront .Visitors can walk along the 
 cliffs, promenade and rockpools. Other
 activities include surfing, swimming, 
 sunbathing, fishing and the sandy     
 beach is good for children. In the    
 summer season cafes and amusements    
 open. The Italian Gardens and woods   
 are a major attraction. The beaches   
 are well used by people of Saltburn   
 as well as visitors from nearby towns 
 and coach trippers from further away. 
 Long stay visitors use the caravan    
 site in Hazel Grove and the few guest 
 houses which are available. Saltburn  
 is part of the Cleveland Way and its  
 Youth Hostel provides accommodation   
 for those interested in exploring its 
 natural environment.                  </content>
