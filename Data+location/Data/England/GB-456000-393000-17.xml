		<title>17LIFESTYLE IN TICKHILL</title>
		<content> Tickhill is not very varied in its    
{fashion}of dress.There are a few mods 
 about who dress in long khaki coloured
 coats,tight jeans and boots.Quite a   
 lot of adults go around in sunglasses,
 designer{clothes}and drive posh cars. 
 Most of us wear tight,bleached or grey
 jeans and jumpers.At the moment white 
 jackets and trousers are the "cool"   
 look for boys.Girls wear long,straight
 or short skirts as well as jeans      
 depending on the occasion.We all      
 listen to{pop music}whether it is on  
 television,radio,records or cassettes.
 On Saturdays most of us go into town  
 either to buy things or just to have a
 look around.Sunday is the most boring 
 day of the week because hardly        
 anywhere is open.People often go to   
 visit their relatives on a Sunday as  
 it is a day off for most people.
