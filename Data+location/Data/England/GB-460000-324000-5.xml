		<title>05EMILY'S DAY IN WILLOUGHBY</title>
		<content> A typical Thursday for me would be to 
 wake up 7.45.a.m, to actually get out 
 of bed at 8.00.a.m. and then have my  
 breakfast of cocoa pops at 8.15.a.m.  
 After I'd brushed my teeth and hair   
 and washed I would go and call for    
 Charlie.Then I would wait at Charlie's
 until school starts. We always go to  
 school at  quarter to nine but school 
 starts at 9.oo.a.m. When we get to    
 school we wait until 9.00.a.m. then we
 usually read for about quarter of an  
 hour. After that we have something    
 like handwriting and then television  
 at 9.30.a.m. Our television at the    
 moment is about "The Night Swimmers"  
 by Betsy Byars. Then for about twenty 
 minutes we'd do something like maths. 
 At 10.30.a.m. we have play . We'd     
 probably play Port and Starboard; it's
 a really good game. Then when we come 
 in we do a bit more maths.            </content>
