		<title>08Eastrop Park in Basingstoke</title>
		<content> We went to{Eastrop Park,}it is very   
 good there with lots to look at,      
{benches}to sit on,{two small lakes}and
 pretty flowers, which I think{old     
{people}would like to look at.  There  
 are lots of things to{play}on too.  On
 one lake there was a{swan}and four    
{ducklings. }Some{children sailed}their
{model boats}on the other lake.  When  
 we had had a good look around we had  
 our{picnic lunch. }We saw a man{raking
 the lake.  He told us that it was his 
 job to keep the lake free of{litter.  
 The water was very{dirty}but I could  
 see some{tadpoles}and little{fish.    
 The{activities}for children are       
{swings, slides}and a{rope climbing    
{frame}called a{spider. }I thought this
 was great, it was made of{red rope}and
 was very{bouncy. }It was shaped like  
 the{Eiffel tower. }The{toilets}there  
 were convenient.  By Katy Bates.      </content>
