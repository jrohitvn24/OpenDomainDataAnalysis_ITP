		<content>{CHURCH OF ST.PETER 6 ST.CLARE}dates   
 back to the Norman Conquest.The oldest
 gravestone seen is dated 1776.It seats
 120 people, &amp; Dr. David Pym is our new
 Rector.The spire was once struck by   
 lightening,&amp; was rebuilt with no new  
 stone, so it is a funny shape.There   
 are bullet holes in the main door from
 the Battle of Edgehill.One Rector was 
 a half brother to King Henry 3rd.There
 are only 3 bells,and a lot of money   
 has been spent in restoring the Church
 in 1985.The{Chapel}was started in     
 1838,&amp; the font was presented by Mrs. 
 R.Alexander in 1842. There's a balcony
 &amp; a big stove for heating.It is very  
 clean &amp; very plain,and belonge to the 
 Methodists. There are some Roman      
 Catholics in the grid area, &amp; they    
 havw to go to Church at Avon Dassett, 
 over the hill, which is very steep &amp;  
 dangerous in icy weather.             </content>
