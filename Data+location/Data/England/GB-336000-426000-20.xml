		<content> The attitudes of people in Lytham     
 towards their area is generally       
 complimentary.Transport services are  
 considered expensive but good.As far  
 as the younger generation is concerned
 there is virtually nothing for them to
 do.The leisure activities for the     
 older generation are considerably more
 numerous.                             
   The majority of houses in Lytham are
 pre-l920 and are considered desirable 
 properties.The most common houses in  
 Lytham are Victorian terraces.The more
 modern houses being true bungalows,   
 large houses and flats.House prices in
 Lytham range from Â£l6,000 to Â£l20,000.
 At present Lytham is expanding with   
 more people moving into the Community 
 than leaving.However,there is little  
 if any room for development since the 
 completion of the South Park Estate   
 commenced in l970.                    </content>
