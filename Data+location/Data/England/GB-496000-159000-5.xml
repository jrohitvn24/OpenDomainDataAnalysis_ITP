		<content>      {Millbrook Animal Centre         
      {R.S.P.C.A. Headquarters.        
   We visited the centre on July 3rd   
 1985.It is the largest established of 
 the R.S.P.C.A. Headquarters homes,    
 having been given in 1965.            
   We were shown round by a lady who   
 had worked there for 6 years and knew 
 the system well.The centre covers 17.5
 acres and has accomodation for{guinea 
{pigs}and other small animals.At       
 present they have two baby{deer}which 
 well meaning people have'saved' from  
 the local area although they had      
 merely been left for the day by the   
 does;in addition there is ample       
 housing for{dogs}and a modern{cattery.
   The staff arrive at 8.30 in the     
 morning and let the dogs out of their 
 indoor pens into their runs.At about  
 9a.m. the dogs are fed Vitalise and   
 Tripe,with puppy mix for the{puppies. </content>
