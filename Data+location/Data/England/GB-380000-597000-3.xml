		<content>{Education}for the children of the area
 involves much travelling.On reaching  
 high_school age,young people must     
 decide whether to{travel daily}to     
 Ponteland {or board}at Haydon Bridge. 
{Here are the thoughts of 2 teenagers }
 "The prospect of a journey of 60 miles
 a day did not appeal.Boarding has its 
{disadvantages:}being away from home,  
 and the restrictions imposed become   
 tedious.{Advantages}_  I have         
  taken part in many out_of_school     
 activities I would otherwise have     
 missed and boarding has prepared me   
 for leaving home to further my        
 education."  {"The journey to school }
  on icy roads is often boring and     
 monotonous.I have less time for re _  
 creation or homework.I don't regret   
 living near Rochester_I  feel I am an 
 individual not just a member of       
  another nuclear family in suburbia." </content>
