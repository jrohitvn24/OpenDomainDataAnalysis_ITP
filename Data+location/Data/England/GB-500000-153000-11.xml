 in possession of the Weston family    
 until 1920. It has since been owned by

 Getty. In 1980 estate sold to Anglo-  
 Texan Property Company, then leased to

 inspiration and motivation behind the 
 exstensive renovation of the house and
 landscaping the garden. Seeger moved  
 pemanently abroad having set up Sutton
 Place Heritage Trust with three aims -
 to preserve and maintain the house and
 1000 acres of land (some land leased  
 to farmers), to encourage performing  
 and visual arts,to provide an area for
 conservation.It is no longer a family 
 home.The Estate is open to the public 
 by appointment only for the following 
 activities - ecology walks, garden and
 house tours, art exhibitions and      
 concerts followed by teas and dinners.</content>
