		<content>     The {census  figures}for the{civil
{parish of Yanworth}included the estate
 buildings etc. at Stowell Park.   With
 this small exception, the  census area
 very   conveniently  also  corresponds
 with this study area.                 
     Again very conveniently _ with the
 same exception  _ {the study area}to a
 very  large  extent {corresponds  with
{the boundaries of  one of  the largest
{privately owned and  run  agricultural
{estates in the county, (c.5040 acres).

 aspects of living  in  rural Yanworth.
 For example, of the 45 households only
 about two were owner occupied and none
 were rented from the council.  With  a
 negligible number of privately  rented
 properties {almost all the  population
{live in tied agricultural cottages.The
{result has been  an unspoilt landscape
{with  a farming orientated population.</content>
