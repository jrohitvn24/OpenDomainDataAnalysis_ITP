		<content> There is very little tradingas        
 distinct from industry in this        
 area.The Eastfields area has only a   
 handfull of shops.In the area there   
 are only two shops.Both are 'cornor   
 shops'inthat they sell a large range  
 of day-to-day products, from food and 
 drink to clothing.Both are run by     
 Asians with great success.This lack of
 shops is often a great complaint but  
 the planners still see that housing,  
 shops and industry all need to be kept
 separate.                             
 The fengate site is mainly            
 industrial.However there are a number 
 of units which first began to service 
 the wholesale trade and then began to 
 attract retail business e.g. tyre     
 fitting, paint and                    
 'Do-It-Yourself',car garage/repairs   
 and heating services.
