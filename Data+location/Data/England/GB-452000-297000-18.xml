		<content> I come back to get my sandwich box.   
 We go into the hall, sit in our       
 places and say grace, then I eat my   
 sandwiches.                           
  When everybody has finished we go out
 to play. After which Mr Keeling takes 
 the register and says what were going 
 to do in the afternoon. We have drama,
 R.E,games P.E and art. We usually have
 a story or a game before we go home.  
   My sister waits for me while I get  
 ready then we both go to my mums car. 
   When I'm home I call for my friends 
 Samantha, Rebecca,Emma, Rachel, Nicola
 and Anna. When I've played for a while
 I go in for my tea. Sometimes I go out
 to play again. Otherwise have a bath .
 Then I read a book,play a game or     
 watch television. Then I go upstairs  
 and clean my teeth,and at 9o'clock I  
 go to bed.                            
                                       </content>
