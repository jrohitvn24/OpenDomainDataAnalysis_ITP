		<title>08FRUIT FARM WORKER</title>
		<content> My Dad gets up at 6am,has breakfast   
 and briefly watches TV.At 7.10am he   
 goes to work at the fruit farm,where  
 we live.He begins by ploughing,       
 spraying or picking.In the Summer at  
 8.30am the ladies arrive to pick      
 strawberries,raspberries,apples and   
 pears.My Dad drives the tractor with  
 cages and bolt bins to collect the    
 fruit.After a tea break at 10.30 he   
 might spray unripe fruit or clean     
 fruit by drenching.At 12 noon he stops
 for lunch,begining again at 1pm,when  
 he loads lorries,then continues       
 picking,spraying or ploughing.At the  
 end of the afternoon,he collects the  
 fruit which has been picked during the
 day.From 6 to 7pm he does some        
 drenching.At 7pm he comes home,has tea
 and goes out gardening.At 10pm he     
 comes back in and goes to bed.
