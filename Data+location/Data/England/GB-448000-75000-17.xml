		<title>17A Niton Undercliff Tragedy</title>
		<content> The local inhabitants were saddened   
 to learn one November morning in 1984 
 that the famous Sandrock Hotel had    
 suffered severe fire damage during the
 early hours.The Hotel,built in 1790,  
 had had many distinguished visitors   
 including Queen(then Princess)        
 Victoria,who at the age of 15 stayed  
 there. The event made a great impact  
 on the local children one of whom     
 wrote:"I think the Sandrock is        
 destroyed  completely and I don't     
 think there  will be another one like 
 it.It's just ruined,shattered and a   
 big lump of charcoal.It's empty,spooky
 and an unhappy sight.Just think how   
 upset the people and the manager were 
 when it was burnt down.It was 194     
 years old.I bet Queen Victoria would  
 be upset too,(if she lived now)! I    
 feel really sad about it because my   
 uncle used to play in a band there."  </content>
