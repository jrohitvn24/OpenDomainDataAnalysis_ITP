		<title>16My House By Edward Wright</title>
		<content>   My house was built in about{1900.}It
 has a hall, kitchen, cellar, dining   
 room, lounge, bathroom, three bedrooms
 and an attic bedroom, which I share   
 with my brother. My house is built of 
 stone with a grey slate roof and bay  
 windows.                              
    My Mum and Dad have owned the      
 house for fourteen years. The family  
 who owned it before us were Dr. and   
 Mrs Flint and their two daughters who 
 owned it from 1951 to 1971.           
    Mr. and Mrs. Thomson lived here in 
 about 1940 and a Mr. Dawes owned the  
 house after her. Mr. Davies was gassed
 in his sleep when a boulder rolled    
 down from the hill side and broke a   
 gas pipe that led to the house. The   
 garage was used as a{undertakers}and a
{joiners}by Mr. Herbert Wragg until    
 about 1930. On the drive there was a  
 hut where the joiner kept his wood.   </content>
