		<content>{ Industry}in Barrow began with        
 shipping out iron ore that had been   
 mined inland. There were only a few   
 cottages here then. In the 1840's the 
{railway}came to Furness. Up to then   
 the area had been very remote. Then   
{iron-making}was started in 1857, and  
{ship-building}using iron began in     
 1870.                                 
                                       
  Today, ship-building is still the    
 most important industry in the town.  
 The shipyard, called Vickers, was     
 nationalised by the Labour Government 
 some years ago. Now there are plans by
 the Conservative Government to privat-
 ise it again.                         
                                       
  About half the working people in     
 Barrow work for Vickers.
