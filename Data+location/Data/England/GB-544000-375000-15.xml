		<content> A Day in my Life.                     
 I wake up in the morning and switch on
 the television for{TVAM.}When the     
 adverts come on I have my breakfast   
 which is three{Weetabix mashed up with
{hot milk.}For school I mainly wear    
 jeans, tee shirt and a plain jumper.  
 School starts at nine o'clock to which
 I walk every day. We have our dinner  
 at 11.50 and I go home for a meal     
 which is nearly always salad. Half    
 past three is home time and when I get
 in I switch on the television. I      
 always have a hot tea which is mainly 
{meat, mashed potatoes and carrots.}I  
 go to bed at nine  o'clock but I read 
 for half an hour. Wednesday is a very 
 special day for me because I have     
 tennis coaching at the{Queen Elizabeth
{Grammar School}for an hour.
