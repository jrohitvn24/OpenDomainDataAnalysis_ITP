		<content>   The Anglican Church of{St.Mary the  
{Virgin}is Rolvenden's oldest building.
 It is looked after by the Parochial   
 Church Council which has 17 members.  
   This year there was a new Vicar in  
 the Parish, Rev. Peter Hammond. He    
 replaced Rev. John Wright, who had    
 been the Vicar for 10 years.  In the  
 Church there is a list of Vicars which
 goes back to the year 1244, when John 
 de Waddenton was Rector.              
   On Sundays there are usually four   
 services in the Church. (8 a.m. Holy  
 Communion, 10 a.m. Family Service,    
 11 a.m. Matins(Morning Prayer) or Holy
 Communion (sung) and 6.30 p.m.Evensong
 (Evening Prayer)                      
   There are also baptisms, marriages  
 and burials at the Church.  Because   
 the Church is so old there have been  
 many burials in the large churchyard, 
 which is a quiet, peaceful place.     </content>
