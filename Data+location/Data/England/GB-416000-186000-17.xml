		<title>17SOUTH MARSTON NOTES</title>
		<content> Most of the houses were built in the  
 20th century but many were built in   
 the 19th century. Many of the         
 Victorian houses are made of stone but
 some are made of bricks. There are 201
 houses in the villlage and a large    
 proportion are detached. Two new      
 estates have been built within the    
 last 18 months, one of which is on the
 site of the old Manor House. Church   
 Farm is one of the few surviving      
 pre-Victorian houses. There are some  
 old South Marston families still      
 living here today. The most notable   
 are the{Sansums}and the{Larges.       
 Our most notable personality was      
{Alfred Williams,}"the Hammerman Poet",
 who died in 1930. Alfred built his own
 house from material taken from a      
 derelict lock of the Wilts &amp; Berks    
 Canal. The house survives today and is
 called{"Ranikhet".                    </content>
