		<content>  Dairy-farming and stock-rearing are  
 the main branches of farming in this  
 area with some sheep and pig-rearing, 
 a small acreage of arable land (mainly
 barley) and some egg production.      
  With the exception of "Oddo Farm"    
 farms are worked by the family.       
  Most fields are small and enclosed by
 stone walls. The making of silage has 
 increased in recent years but some    
 farmers still gather hay only.        
 Mechanisation increases from year to  
 year.                                 
  Milk is collected daily by a milk    
 tanker and taken to a bottling plant  
 in Sheffield.                         
  Livestock markets are at Bakewell    
 and Uttoxeter.
