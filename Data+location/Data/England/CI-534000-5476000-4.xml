		<title>04Harbour Marina Development</title>
		<content>    Work began in 1984 on a Â£16 million
 multi-purpose to develop the beautiful
 north arm of St.Peter Port harbour.   
    Due for completion in 1988 this    
 scheme will provide a new 20 acre     
 marina with moorings for 800 local and
 visiting boats.                       
    One thousand new car-parking spaces
 will be created and a roundabout to   
 ease traffic congestion into the town.
    These will be increased facilities 
 for local marine trades, berthing     
 areas in the existing harbour will be 
 improved by dredging and new space for
 containers and ro-ro traffic.         
    Some 80 workers have been directly 
 involved as well as backup from       
 quarrymen, lorry drivers etc.         
    Guernsey's Board of Administration,
 which is responsible for the project, 
 is confident that it will be of major 
 long term benefit to the Island.      </content>
