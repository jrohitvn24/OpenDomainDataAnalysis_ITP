		<title>11Shopping around Ruan Minor</title>
		<content> Out of all the people in the class    
 most of them do some shopping in this 
 area and most of them also do some    
 shopping away.There are three shops   
 here.One shop is the greengrocer's    
 which sells fruit, vegetables and     
 flowers.The other two shops are called
 A.P.T. and Spar.They both sell        
 food,sweets,cards and things you need 
 in the house like soap.People have to 
 shop away to get things like furniture
 and clothes.Some of the places people 
 go to are Helston,Falmouth,Truro and  
 Penzance.It is difficult unless you   
 have a car because there is only one  
 bus a week.                           
 I used to live in Penzance but now I  
 live in Kuggar.The main difference    
 between Penzance and here is the      
 number of shops. Penzance has a lot   
 more people.                          
                                       </content>
