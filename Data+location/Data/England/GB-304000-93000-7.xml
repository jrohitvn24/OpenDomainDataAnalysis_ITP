		<title>07The Knoll</title>
		<content> The Knoll is approximately 500 years  
 old and is in Marsh Green(square 9),  
 which was originally a settlement in  
 Saxon times.The house is made of cob  
 which is a mixture of earth, stone and
 straw.It was first made as four       
 cottages, then they were converted    
 into two houses.After the First World 
 War it was changed to one house.Joined
 to the house is a Smithy which was    
 built for farm labourers. Separating  
 the house and the road there is an    
 orchard.At the bottom of the drive    
 there is a store which is at least 100
 years old and very rare.In the kitchen
 there is an iron fire which is about  
 200 years old and is thought to have  
 been made in France or Belgium.In the 
 lounge there are some alcoves which   
 were put there in Queen Anne's reign.
