		<content>         As in most places in the      
 British Isles there has been a vast   
 expansion of numbers of children in   
 schools,which has now,and continues,to
 grow smaller.There are eight junior   
 schools in our survey area including  
 one Roman Catholic and two private.   
         These in turn send their      
 pupils to two main comprehensive      
 schools and again there are three     
 private schools in our survey area.   
         The sixth form college which  
 originated as a 'poor' school in the  
 last century,has this year amalgamated
 with the local Technical College      
 forming one new Tertiary College.     
         Two of the comprehensive      
 schools are designated community      
 schools and their facilities are very 
 well used by the populace.
