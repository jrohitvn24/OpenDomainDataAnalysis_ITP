		<content> High above the valley called 'Crocks  
 Bottom' stands the ramparts of        
 Blackers Hill Camp, a prehistoric     
 earthwork which may have served to    
 guard the Fosse Way from the west.    
 Only parts of the ramparts and dyke   
 can now be traced mainly on the north 
 and western edges.  part of he hill   
 was known as 'Fairey slats' but       
 unfortunately the reason for this has 
 been lost.  Close to the earthwork is 
 Blackers Hill Farm.  A seventeenth    
 century house which until recently had
 been let to fall into bad repair.  In 
 the last few years however it has been
 successfully repaired an modernised.  
 The area is full of evidence of       
 occupations through many centuries, it
 is good to see some people still      
 remain.
