		<title>12North Newington Village (2)</title>
		<content>  The village has only had water on tap
and mains electricity for the last 20  
years. Some of the people who live in  
the village do travel a distance to    
work. The Headteacher of our school    
lives in this village. It is a very    
quiet place without much traffic.      
  The village is about {4 miles from   
Banbury}, the nearest town, and        
surrounded by lovely countryside.      
  There are still people living in the 
village who have been there all their  
lives. If you take a walk up to the    
allotments on a warm summer day, you   
are almost certain to meet one of these
{old pensioners}. They will happily    
talk for hours about how life used to  
be when they were young themselves.
