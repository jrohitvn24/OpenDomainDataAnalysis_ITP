		<title>07A PADSTOW PART-TIME FIREMAN</title>
		<content> I get up at about 7 o'clock and have  
 my breakfast.At half past 8 I go to   
 work.I am a builder and decorator with
 my own business but wherever I go I   
 make sure that I have my pocket       
 bleeper with me just in case there is 
 a fire and I need to be contacted.    
  At 10 o'clock I stop for a short     
 break and then drive into Wadebridge  
 to get some wood.Lunch is at 1 o'clock
 but, before I can start, the bleeper  
 goes off and I rush to the new fire   
 station, opened last year, and change 
 into my uniform.I am the fire engine  
 driver and we hurry to put out a gorse
 fire at St. Eval.I go back home to    
 finish my lunch and then return to my 
 work.After tea I go back to the       
 station for Drill Practice from 6.45  
 until 9 o'clock.After Practice I go to
 the pub with the other firemen and    
 return home at 10.30 and go to bed.   </content>
