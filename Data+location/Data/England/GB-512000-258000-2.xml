		<content> The geologyof this area makes it very 
 valuable for wildlife. It consists of 
 Boulder clay overlying Great Oolite   
 Limestone. In places the limestone is 
 close to the surface. The limestone   
 has been quarried to provide the      
 building stone that is so             
 characteristic of the villages of the 
 Upper Ouse Valley of Bedfordshire.    
 The area isone of gently rolling      
 countryside. There is a major belt of 
 woodland running through the area.    
 This belt of broadleaved woodlands is 
 a very important landscape feature.   
 The combination of these woodlands and
 the local topography makes for very   
 attractive scenery; this area has been
 designated as being of Great Landscape
 Value in the County Structure Plan.   
 The antiquity of these woodlands adds 
 considerably to their importance from 
 a wildlife viewpoint.                 </content>
