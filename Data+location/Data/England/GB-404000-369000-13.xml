		<content> There is no longer a railway station  
 in the area. The {Cromford &amp; High Peak
{Railway}used to run through from south
 east to north west serving the        
 quarries but also carring pssengers.  
 But as the quarries closed so did the 
 railway. There were no more passengers
 after{1954.}Now people have to rely on
 the bus service.                      
 The {185}goes from{Fairfield}up to    
{High Peak College.}There are extra    
 buses in the morning to take students 
 to the college. At night there is only
 one bus an hour. The{192}&amp;{733 (Trent)
 &amp;{593 (Andrews)}all go up Harpur Hill 
 Road on the way to {Chelmorton &amp;      
{Monyash}7 times on weekdays.You can   
 get to{Buxton to Hartington}on the{422
 service 5 times a day and to{Millers' 
{Dale &amp; Castleton}on Saturdays &amp; Bank  
 Holidays. Most people walk or drive.
