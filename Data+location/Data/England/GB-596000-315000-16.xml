		<content> When our teacher attended Gressenhall 
 School in the 1940's, most of the     
 children's fathers were involved with 
 work on the land and none were        
 unemployed. Now because of increased  
 mechanisation on farms very few now   
 have work connected with the land     
 although this is still a rural area.In
 a survey taken from 67 children we    
 discovered that most of our fathers   
 are connected with the building       
 trade.This is not surprising as       
 Norfolk is one of the fastest growing 
 areas in the country and the villages 
 of Beetley and Gressenhall are        
 expanding.There are two local building
 firms R.Duffield of Gressenhall and   
 E.Melton &amp; Sons of Beetley.           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
