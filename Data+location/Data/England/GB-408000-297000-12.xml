		<content> On Friday, June 21st Mr Shelly came to
 see us.He is a member of the Inner    
 Magic circle,Past President of the    
 International Brotherhood of Magicians
 and of the British Magical Society.He 
 was very clever at magic and tricks.He
 came because we found out that he     
 lives in the area we are surveying so 
 we wrote to invite him.He showed us a 
 trick with cards.He had six to start  
 with,threw three away,but still had   
 six left!Another trick was to put some
 water in a beaker,put a piece of paper
 on top,then turn the beaker upside    
 down,the water stayed in it.Then he   
 cut some rope and made it join to     
 gether again. His final trick was to  
 drop a piece of blue tissue and when  
 he picked it up it was a Union Jack!  
 His number plate was MAG 11C. It      
 nearly spells magic.
