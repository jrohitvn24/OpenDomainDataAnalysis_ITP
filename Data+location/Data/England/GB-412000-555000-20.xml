		<title>20HAMSTERLEY MILL ESTATE</title>
		<content>   The estate also includes the mill   
 from which the estate gets its name.  
 This has now been converted into a    
 house. We have no shops or amenities  
 which a village would have, but still 
 I would not like to live anywhere     
 else. Most of our evenings are spent  
 either walking the dogs on the Derwent
 Walk or playing in the garden. I      
 sometimes have to help my mother in   
 the garden, which is quite large, and 
 I enjoy fruit picking in the orchard.
