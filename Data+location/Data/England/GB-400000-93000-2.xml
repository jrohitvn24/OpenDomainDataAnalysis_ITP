     When I wake up which is about 7   
 o'clock,I just lie there for about ten
 minutes.Then I go downstairs and have 
 a cup of tea and a bowl of cornflakes 
 with my brother.                      
     Then we both go upstairs and get  
 dressed.By now my dad is usually up   
 and my mum is always up before me.    
 After we've dressed,I go downstairs   
 and pack my bag for school-it's full  
 of homework,if we were unlucky the    
 night before!My dad is usually        
 downstairs having his breakfast when  
 my brother and I leave for school at  
 about half past eight.                
      Then it's school.Oh well,never   
 mind!                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
