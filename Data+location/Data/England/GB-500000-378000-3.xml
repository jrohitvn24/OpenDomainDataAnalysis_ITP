		<content> Interview with Mr. Dodsworth, a farmer
 from Welton. #######################  
 What would have been a typical day in 
 your life 25 years ago?               
 We were milking about 15 cows then,   
 with buckets.  We were growing a      
 variety of crops, oats, potatoes,     
 sugerbeet and grass.                  
 What about today?                     
 We are milking about 60 cows now with 
 machines. We only grow wheat and      
 barley now, not such a wide range of  
 crops.                                
 What sort of entertainment did you    
 have?                                 
 We chased the girls, went to dances   
 and the cinema and about the same     
 things you do now. The cinema was in  
 Lincoln and cost about 25p , much     
 cheaper than the Â£2.20. now.
