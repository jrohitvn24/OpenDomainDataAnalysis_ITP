		<title>19PENNS LODGE HISTORY</title>
		<content>    This house, in the Parish of       
 Brinkworth, has connections with the  
 Penn family. William Penn 1644-1718   
 was the founder of Pennsylvania. Penn 
 was a Quaker and was often persecuted 
 for his beliefs. In 1618 Penn's father
 Admiral Sir William Penn died and his 
 son obtained from Charles II's govern-
 ment,in lieu of his father's claim    
 upon it,a grant of territory in North 
 America. This land was called PENSIL- 
 VANIA in honour of the Admiral.William
 Penn sailed for America in 1682. He   
 planned the building of Philadelphia  
 and governed the colony justly. He    
 took up the cause of the negroes and  
 heartily condemned the slave trade.   
 Penn made several journeys to England 
 to improve the negroes lot. He even-  
 tually sold his American Rights to the
 government.His grave is in the grounds
 of Jordons Meeting House,Beaconsfield.</content>
