		<content> One of the most interesting things    
 that has stayed constant over the     
 years,has been the in which the       
{Population}has tended to stay within  
 this same area.When we did a survey,we
 found that most of the{families}were  
 able to say that their relatives had  
 lived in the district for as long as  
 they could remember.Indeed when we    
 looked at some{local records}we kept  
 on coming across the same family names
 over and over again.                  
 Many of the local place names also    
 give reminders of the past.for        
 instance{Tollgate,}which marks the    
 sight where the tolls were paid,and   
 the{Green}which has seen public       
 hangings and the burning of witches.  
 Even today many families find that    
 they tend to stay within the area,some
 thought that it was the close         
 connection with the sea.              </content>
