		<content>   When you read this page, we wonder  
 what year it will be. 2085?  2185?    
 We wonder who you are, what age, and  
 where you are reading this.           
   We travelled to our block by minibus
 which seats about 15.  Do you have    
 cars and the dirty combustion engine? 
 How fast and how far can you travel?  
 What sort of breakfast do you eat?  Do
 you still have eggs?  Do you still eat
 meat? Are there places called Schools 
 or do you learn everything by         
 computer? Do you have watches with    
 hands? We have lots of machinery in   
 our homes, but do you have robots?    
   We live in houses with gardens. We  
 wonder if you have space for gardens  
 to grow flowers. Are there fields of  
 wheat and orchards with fruit trees?  
   Do you have democracy?              
   We wonder....                       
                                       </content>
