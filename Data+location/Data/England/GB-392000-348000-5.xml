Also in the area of Bagnall there is a 
Mushroom Farm.In the farm there are    
long sheds;here the mushrooms are      
grown.The mushrooms are sold to        
wholesalers and also to shops.The      
noticable change is that the farm is   
modernised with up to date sheds which 
have heating generated by Coal.        
   The farmer who owns the farm told us
that he uses specially made compost to 
grow the mushrooms in.He has also done 
other types of farming but finds this  
type more profitable by far.           
   Most of the orders are done over the
phone and the mushrooms are either     
delivered or collected by the customer.
   The mushrooms are grown all the year
round due to the fact that they are    
grown in specially heated sheds.
