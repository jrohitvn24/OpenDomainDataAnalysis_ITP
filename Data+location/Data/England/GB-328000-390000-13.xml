		<title>13My Mum when she was my age.</title>
		<content> My Mum's name is Lyn. When she was    
 nine she lived in Tyrer Street at     
 number 2. In the house were two       
 bedrooms, no bathroom,one living room 
 and one back kitchen.My mum went to{  
{Gautby School}.She wore navy blue     
 Knickers,yellow and black ties and a  
 uniform.She says my school is a more  
 modern school than Gautby because they
 had two playgrounds.The school meals  
 were nice.You got saoup,dinner and a  
 pudding.They cost 2 shillings and six 
 pence a week and you could go there   
 for your meals in the holidays.When   
 she went back to school she played    
 rounders,tick,hoola hoops,top and whip
 marbles and leapfrog,skipping and     
 jacks.She went to the beach and the   
 park.She used to watch lots of        
 different programmes.She has one      
 brother and two sisters.
