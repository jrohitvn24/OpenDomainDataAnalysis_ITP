		<title>15MY VILLAGE: RAWNSLEY</title>
		<content> {Rawnsley}is a very untidy place but  
it is a very pleasant place to live    
because there is little traffic, it is 
quiet and it is close to{Cannock       
Chase}. The trouble is there are a few 
vandals  who damage places like our    
park. They spray paint all over the    
slide, they kick fences down, and they 
trample trees down. I think they should
appreciate things in life.             
  The council has decided to get extra 
help to repair damaged and dilapidated 
buildings and to clean and tidy        
community areas. Most of the housing is
council owned but a few have been      
bought from the council. A new village 
has been built with better houses that 
are more carefully looked after. It has
two football pitches and a park.
