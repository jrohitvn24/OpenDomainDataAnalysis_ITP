		<content> The only other convenience is a       
 travelling library which comes around 
 on the Wednesday of every third week  
 at 2.10 p.m                           
 Several buses owned by a private firm 
 travel each way from Yeovil to Marston
 every day and there is a late bus each
 Saturday.                             
 No petrol can be obtained in the      
 village,the nearest station is either 
 Mudford or Queen Camel.               
 The main road through the village has 
 no street lighting,no speed limit and 
 two very sharp bends which make it    
 quite dangerous.                      
 It is a noisy place because of the    
 heavy road traffic passing through and
 as it is on the fligth path for       
 Yeovilton Naval Air Base planes are   
 constantly flying overhead.           
 Most of the house are too expensive   
 for young married people to buy.      </content>
