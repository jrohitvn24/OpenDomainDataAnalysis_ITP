		<title>06A NEW HALL FOR CRUDWELL</title>
		<content> In 1983 village people began to       
 propose that{a new village hall}should
 be built.It was felt that{the existing
{hall was not big enough}and also as   
 there is only one room it is only     
 possible for one thing to take place  
 at a time.The{lack of parking         
{facilities}makes it very dangerous    
 especially at playgroup time.Fund     
 raising started in 1984 and so far{a  
{total of Â£3,600 has been reached.}This
 has been from a variety of sources,   
 including a very successful{donkey    
{derby}held in June 1985 and a{dance   
 run by the Women's Institute.The      
 position of grants is being           
 investigated by a small committee and 
 charity status will be sought.The     
 present{total cost of a new hall is   
{about Â£65,000.}It is hoped that the   
 new  hall will include facilities for 
 sports such as badminton.             </content>
