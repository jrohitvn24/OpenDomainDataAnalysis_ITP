		<content> TODAY, MANY MOTHERS HAVE TO WORK ALL  
 DAY AND ARE NOT ABLE TO SPEND MUCH OF 
 THEIR TIME PREPARING MEALS AND DOING A
 LOT OF COOKING.MEALS TEND TO BE MADE  
 FROM FOOD WHICH IS READY PREPARED OR  
 COOKED AND THEN DEEP FROZEN.THIS IS   
 CALLED CONVENIENCE FOOD.MANY PEOPLE   
 HAVE BOUGHT DEEP FREEZERS WHICH HOLD A
 LOT OF FOOD AND CAN BE KEPT FROZEN FOR
 MANY MONTHS.HOWEVER, YOU MUST PLAN    
 YOUR MEALS IN ADVANCE BECAUSE THE FOOD
 CAN TAKE SEVERAL HOURS OR EVEN DAYS TO
 DEFROST READY FOR COOKING.A NEW TYPE  
 OF COOKER CALLED A MICROWAVE OVEN IS  
 OFTEN USED TO DEFROST FOOD AND COOK IT
 QUICKLY. IT CAN DO IT IN MINUTES      
 RATHER THAN HOURS.                    
 CONVENIENCE FOODS ARE VERY USEFUL FOR 
 OWNERS OF CAFES OR SMALL HOTELS WHERE 
 THEY DO NOT HAVE REGULAR MEALS TO     
 PREPARE. I STILL PREFER FRESH FOOD.
