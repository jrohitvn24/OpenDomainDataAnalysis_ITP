		<content> Local children get up in the week at  
 about 7.30a.m. Their breakfast is     
 usually cereal and a drink. They are  
 at school from 8.50a.m. to 3.15p.m.,  
 where they have assembly, maths,      
 language, games and P.E., art and     
 craft, music, science, environmental  
 studies and topic work and watch      
 occasional educational television     
 programmes. In the morning they have  
 15 minutes playtime, and at lunch-time
 75 minutes. About half the children   
 have school lunch and the rest have   
 packed lunch. After school they watch 
 television for about an hour. After   
 tea they often play outside in the    
 summer for about 2 hours. In winter   
 they watch more television. Bed-time  
 is usually 9.30p.m..
