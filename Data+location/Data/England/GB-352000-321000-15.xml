		<content>     Using the information we had back 
 from the{questionaires}we found out   
 that 85 out of 200 homes didn't have  
 any pets at all, the rest did.        
     {Goldfish}were the most popular   
 pets. 93 out of 115 homes had one. 89 
 homes out of a 115 had a dog and 75   
 had a cat. There were 16 homes with   
 rabbits and 8 homes with birds.The    
 least popular pets were{tortoises,    
{snakes, lizards}and{stick insects.    
 Only 2 homes had each of these. 30 out
 of the 115 homes that had pets had 4  
 or more.
