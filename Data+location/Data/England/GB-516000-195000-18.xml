 "I came to Borehamwood in 1952, so I  
 have lived here for 33 years. The main
 changes I have seen are the massive   
 increase in population and a steady   
 growth in the number of shops.        
 Of course, there have been some less  
 satisfactory changes - now there's    
 very little to do in the evenings     
 apart from going to one of the many   
 pubs. I really miss the cinema since  
 it closed - going to a film at the    
 Civic Hall doesn't have anything like 
 the same atmosphere. Also the cost of 
 things has changed out of all         
 proportion - when I came here you     
 could get into the cinema for twopence
 (1p.) and to the football ground for  
 threepence! You can't do that these   
 days!"
