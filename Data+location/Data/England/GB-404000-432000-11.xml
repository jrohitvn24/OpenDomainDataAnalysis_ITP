		<content> Denholme block ranges from{l,4OO      
{feet}a.s.l.to{75O feet }a.s.l.        
 Generally hilly, with deep {cloughs}  
 (or valleys) down from the rough      
 moorland.  The rock is {millstone grit
 used for dry stone walls, with        
 evidence of boulder clay and coal     
 measures.  The soft water here        
 attracted the woollen industry.       
 The {prevailing winds} W.and S W. give
 a bracing, sometimes severe climate.  
 The sun DOES shine, even when the     
 valleys are shrouded in mist, and in  
 contrast, the village is occasionally 
 cut off by snow.                      
 Bilberries, heather, cotton grass grow
 on the moor, inhabited by rabbits,    
 foxes and curlews.  Yet by the more   
 sheltered Doe Park reservoir wood     
 anemores, milkmaids can be found, and 
 swifts,swallows and owls make their   
 homes here.                           </content>
