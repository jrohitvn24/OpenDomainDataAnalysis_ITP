		<content> Richard and Julia are finding out     
 about what people do in their spare   
 time,if any.We asked some old people  
 some questions and here are the       
 answers we finally received.Most of   
 the people we interviewed like going  
 to the church,and like going to the   
 services held at the church.Then they 
 can meet their friends regularly.Quite
 a few people like working and going to
 the farm.The farm owns the stables and
 it is next to the Easthorpe Hall.A few
 people we interviewed like going to   
 see their friends somewhere in the    
 village. Cycling was not a very       
 popular subject.There were one or two 
 people who had hobbies that we did not
 have on our particular list at the    
 time.There were five old people who   
 enjoyed playing board games because it
 filled their time up when they are at 
 a loose end.                          </content>
