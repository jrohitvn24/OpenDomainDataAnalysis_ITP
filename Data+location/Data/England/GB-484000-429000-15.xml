		<content>  Just opposite our school there is a  
 big house belonging to Dr.Mackensie.  
 At the side of the house there used to
 be a surgery, where everyone who was  
 ill went to see the doctors. Two years
 ago a new health centre was built in  
 the next village of Gilberdyke. It is 
 very good. The doctors wanted a heart 
 monitor for the new centre but they   
 did not have enough money to buy one. 
  So my mum, Mrs Waddingham, who plays 
 for the local darts team, said that   
 she would organise a darts tournament 
 to raise money for the heart monitor. 
  The money was soon raised and the    
 darts teams asked the doctor to come  
 to accept the cheque for the monitor. 
 The doctor presented my mum with a    
 trophy as her team won the final      
 match.My mum said that it was  hard   
 work raising the money.
