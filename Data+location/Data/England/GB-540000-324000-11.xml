		<content> Because of the scattered nature of the
 population of this area transport and 
 communication pose their individual   
 problems.Car ownership is extremely   
 high, and it is not unusual for a     
 family to own two or more vehicles.   
 Often this is necessary as there is   
 little public transport away from the 
 main roads, and because of the        
 distances involved and the open nature
 of the countryside, it is not always  
 practical to use a bicycle.Micro-chip 
 technology has been of great value in 
 recent years enabling long distance   
 field communications on the larger    
 farms,and many farm vehicles are      
 equipt with radios and telephones to  
 enable their drivers to be in constant
 touch with their base.This saves much 
 time and money.
