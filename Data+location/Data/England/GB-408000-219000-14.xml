		<title>14Farming at Westfield</title>
		<content> Westfield farm, 375 acres in area, is 
 of arable, sheep and bulls. The wheat 
 is sold for milling, but the barley is
 kept on the farm and ground to feed   
 the bulls. The bulls are taken to     
 Northampton market, as the local      
 Andoversford market does not deal with
 bulls. Wool from the sheep is         
 collected by the Wool Marketing Board 
 and taken to a central depot in       
 Yorkshire. A few chickens are kept for
 eggs for domestic consumption. On one 
 field there is a small c/l caravan    
 site taking a maximum of 5 vans. A tap
 for water and an emptying pit is      
 provided. Bookings have been down in  
 the past 2 or 3 years, due mainly to  
 redundancy in the Midlands. Urban     
 workers used to come to the Cotswolds 
 for weekend breaks.
