		<title>12St. George's Church</title>
		<content>{ST GEORGE'S}was built in 1885 so today
 is celebrating its centenary.It       
 commemorated its centenary with 7     
 mystery plays organised by members of 
 the church.There were also parties and
 services which the Bishop             
 attended.Special mugs and magazines   
 were produced.The present church was  
 rebuilt because the original had      
 problems with an old wooden           
 spire which was falling down one      
 hundred years ago.The Lych Gate still 
 remains from medieval times.It is     
 thirteenth century and is one of the  
 oldest in the country.
