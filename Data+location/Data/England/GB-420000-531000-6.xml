		<title>06INDUSTRY 2. BRICKMAKING</title>
		<content> The largest employer within this block
 is the brickworks at Todhill, run by  
 STEETLEY BRICKS LTD.( 150 approx.).   
 Brickmaking was often associated with 
 mining because of the sedimentary clay
 found in coal measures; sand for re_  
 fractory bricks, shale or heavy clays 
 for engineering bricks.               
 As the mines closed Steetley, whose HQ
 is at Newcastle under Lyme, took over 
 the brick making operations in the old
 colliery railway sheds at the place   
 where the donkey engines hauled up the
 coals from the drift-mines in the     
 river valley. Raw-materials suitable  
 for bricks are still readily available
 hence the quarries at Newfield.       
 Steetley still produce eng.bricks from
 local shales, plus many domestic types
 inc quality facing &amp; "hand-made".     
 The BSC.,Newfield plant for ref-bricks
 now closed: recession in steel making.</content>
