		<content>  On Tuesday  at 5.45 I go to {        
{Brixington Blues.}We pay 30p each week
 and one pound every year for          
 membership.We start by warming up and 
 then have a practice match.The people 
 who help out are Mr Trail, Mr Haysom, 
 Mr Starr and Mr Payne.                
  In the summer we play at school and  
 in the winter we play at the Marine   
 camp at Lympstone. Jeff tells us which
 matches we will be playing and who    
 will be in the team. We have an A and 
 B team.                               
  Every season we have a{presentation} 
 at the{Farmhouse Inn.}There is a disco
 and players receive medals. Also there
 is a raffle . The money raised is used
 to buy gear. Last season Brixington   
 Blues got into three finals and won   
 them all.
