		<content>{Hartington}has a health centre at     
 Church St. which serves the village   
 and surrounding area, 200 square miles
 in all. This covers Derbyshire and    
 Staffordshire. There are two doctors  
 and because the practice see people   
 from two health authorities, there are
 two district nurses. Medicines are    
 dispensed at the surgery because there
 is no local chemist shop. Patients can
 be seen at 14 open  surgeries in      
 Hartington or at the 4 per week held  
 at Longnor. There is also an          
 appointment system from 9 to 10 each  
 morning. Besides an ante-natal clinic 
 there is a baby clinic which sees     
 babies and children for immunisation  
 and general health advice.
