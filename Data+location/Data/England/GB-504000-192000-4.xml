		<content>   We interviewed P.C. Pinkney who     
 enjoys his work, although it can get  
 tiring. Police do a 2 year course to  
 qualify; but they never stop learning 
 throughout their career. Murder is    
 very rare in this area, although it   
 has happened. There are many petty    
 thefts and burglaries by both         
 professional and young occasional     
 criminals.Road accidents are more     
 common in winter than in summer and   
 some are hit and run offences. There  
 are assaults caused by drink or drugs 
 (drugs are on sale here).Some police  
 officers have been assaulted, a few   
 seriously. The police deal with a lot 
 of lost property including dogs. Lost 
 dogs are taken in, kept for 48 hours  
 and then sent to the kennels. All     
 police stations are linked through the
 H.Q. telex. The nearest Crown Court is
 at Watford.                           </content>
