		<title>01FARMLAND SOUTH OF BASCHURCH</title>
		<content> Predominently a rural farming         
 community with undulating land rising 
 slightly towards the west. The River  
 Perry, a tributary of the Severn,     
 flows in a south-easterly direction   
 across the north east corner of the   
 area. Where also the War Brook flows  
 south to join the Perry near Heaton.  
 Three small villages, Little Ness,    
 Yeaton and Grafton and one hamlet Nibs
 Heath are linked by minor roads. The  
 'B' class road from Shrewsbury to     
 Baschurch crosses the north east      
 section of the area. Straddling it are
 the old halls, farm buildings, new    
 dormitory accommodation and teaching  
 blocks comprising the Shropshire farm 
 institute providing local employment  
 for agricultural workers, domestics   
 and some teachers. A girls public     
 boarding/day school Adcote is situated
 in several acres of its own grounds   </content>
