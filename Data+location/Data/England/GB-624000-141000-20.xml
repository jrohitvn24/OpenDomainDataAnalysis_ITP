		<title>20CURRENT ISSUES IN ALKHAM</title>
		<content> Alkham is a dormitory village and is  
 kept so by the conservation policy by 
 which it is covered.Only infilling of 
 housing is allowed and consquently few
 new people move into the village.The  
 age of villagers is always increasing 
 and this is reflected in the clubs and
 societies within the village. The road
 through the Alkham valley, the B2060  
 is too narrow for safety especially in
 the village itself but no plans are   
 yet established to build a by-pass.   
 Speculation about the future Channel  
 Tunnel  have given cause for some     
 concern but as yet no plans definitely
 effect the village. In the near future
 little or no changes in the village   
 are expected.                         
                                       
 Work on the Alkham Valley area was    
 undertaken by St.Mary's CEP School,   
 Folkestone,Kent.                      </content>
