		<content> At the bottom of our school field we  
 have a climbing frame which we climb  
 on in fine weather.Our field is       
 sloping so it is not very good for    
 foot ball and sports day.Netball is   
 played on the tarmac which is also    
 used for play times in the winter.    
  We sometimes play catch and the boys 
 play football and cricket.We have a   
 craze on Queeny at the moment.        
 A row of children pretend to have the 
 ball behind them but one person is    
 actually holding it.The person stand- 
 ing out in front has to guess who's   
 got the ball when they say,           
 "Queeny,Queeny who's got the ball?"   
 We play lots of ball games.Hopscotch  
 is played with a ball or stone and    
 marbles and conkers are popular in    
 season.The girls like to play French  
 skipping with elastic.
