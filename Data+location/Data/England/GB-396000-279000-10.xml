		<content> Many families in the area own or rent 
 a television,video recorder or stereo 
 system which are used in evenings and 
 weekends as the main entertainment for
 the family.Video films rented very    
 cheaply are a great favourite.Outside 
 the home adults favour Bingo and the  
 pub.Children prefer playing outside   
 the home or in the small wooded       
  or countryside areas.Their favourite 
 toys seem to be roller-boots and      
 B.M.X. bikes.Some are interested in   
 the new craze of break dancing or in  
 traditional sports such as footbal    
 There are occasional family outings to
 the cinema,or to eating places such as
 Macdonald's.Some go to Midland        
 football matches or to increasingly   
 popular sports such as ice hockey and 
 basketball - both sports prominent    
 within the City of Birmingham.
