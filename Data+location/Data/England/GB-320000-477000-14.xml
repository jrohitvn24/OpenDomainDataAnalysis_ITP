		<content> Askam Town Band (1985)                
    The South Cumbria Musical Festival 
 was held between 26th-30th March      
 inclusive. This dedicated band worked 
 very hard in rehearsals leading up to 
 the competition and achieved          
 considerable success. In the solo     
 entries, the quartet and full band    
 catagories all marks were above 80%.  
    Following this achievement the Band
 was invited, on 31st March, to share  
 in the celebrations for the Millom    
 Band's 125th anniversary. During the  
 afternoon the bands played in the     
 church at a special service and later 
 that evening they again joined forces 
 for a concert at Millom Conservative  
 Club.                                 
    The Band maintains its continued   
 popularity by giving musical support  
 to various local functions on request.
