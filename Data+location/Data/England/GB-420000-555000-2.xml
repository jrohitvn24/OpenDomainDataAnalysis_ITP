		<title>02FARMING IN GATESHEAD AREA</title>
		<content> There are 8 farms in the region       
 surrounding the three main areas of   
 population,Marley Hill,the Causey and 
 Kibblesworth.The farms were owned by  
 Lord Ravensworth's or the Earl of     
 Strathmore's families for many decades
 The National Coal Board bought land to
 extend its coalmining. Opencast mining
 took place at Old Ravensworth and     
 Kibblesworth.Now most of the farms are
 owned and worked by individual farmers
   They are mainly small mixed arable  
 farms which because of their size do  
 not benefit from the European Economic
 Community.It is the large farms that  
 really benefit because grants are paid
 on a percentage basis.                
     Machinery is becoming faster and  
 more powerful,so farmers can do more  
 work in less time.One farmer,at least 
 is using a computer to record calving 
 times,mating times and milk yield.    </content>
