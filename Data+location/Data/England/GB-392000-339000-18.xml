		<content>A magistrate is a person given the     
authority to judge the public-he is    
often called a Justice of the Peace .  
Decisions must be reached within the   
law .The case must be based on the     
evidence brought to his notice.They    
trains for about 3 months solid at the 
start but that is not all for they are 
learning new things the time.Being a   
magistrate is hard work if it is       
done properly.It involves time and     
patience to listen to what the defend- 
ants say.Male J.Ps wear dark suits and 
ties and white shirts.Females wear dark
dresses or suits of decent length.Court
starts at 10 a.m. whilst the finishing 
time is variable.It all depends on the 
amount and length of cases.There is a  
wide variety of cases, mostly motoring 
offences and smaller crimes.J.Ps.do    
not deal with serious cases like       
murder.                                </content>
