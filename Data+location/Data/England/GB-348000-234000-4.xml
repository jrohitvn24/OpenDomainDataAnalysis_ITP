		<content>  The Barrells of Veddoes Farm.        
                                       
  The Barrells are like any other      
 family except that they live on a     
 farm. Their day in a general way is   
 pretty much like ours.                
  6.30 a.m.  They get up.              
  6.45 a.m.  They milk the cows.       
  8.15 a.m.  Breakfast.                
  8.30 a.m.  Children go to school.    
  They do all the small chores next    
 like feeding the cattle, hens, calves 
 and lambs.                            
  Most Wednesdays they go into town.   
 Mr. Barrell goes to market by himself,
 but he never buys any cattle, which he
 hasn't done for seven years. At around
 six or seven hundred pounds each you  
 can see why.                          
  Mrs Barrell depends heavily on her   
 deep freeze and once in a while buys  
 frozen food to put back in.           </content>
