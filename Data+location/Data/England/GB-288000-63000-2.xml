		<content>  My name is Andrei. I am eight years  
 old. I live in Shiphay, which is a    
 suburb of Torquay. I have a brother   
 called Christopher who is five years  
 old.                                  
 Shiphay has the main hospital of      
 Torbay as well as very old places like
 Water Lane and Edginswell. There are a
 lot of brand new houses in Veille     
 Park, one of the estates. I live in   
 one of the semi-detached houses. Lots 
 of people are moving to this area and 
 there are not enough services. There  
 are more children so there have to be 
 more, or larger, schools.             
 Both my mum and dad work in the       
 hospital. My mum helps to clean the   
 floors and my dad takes X-rays.       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
