		<title>17ASPECTS OF LOCAL HISTORY</title>
		<content> To the south of Wyken Slough it is    
 possible to see the remains of an old 
 mineral railway.There are also several
 low,grass-covered spoil heaps from old
 mines.                                
 The{Walsgrave History Project}team    
 (based at Walsgrave C.E.School) are   
 cataloging information concerning the 
 mining history as some families whose 
 members were local colliers still live
 in the area.                          
 A walking trail has been prepared by  
 the{Coventry Museums.}                
 Another reminder of this era is the   
 name of the B4109,{Parrots Grove}as it
 passes through {Aldermans Green}.     
 Richard Parrot,being a coal owner     
 whose home,Hawkesbury Hall can be seen
 on the road's north side just beyond  
 the city boundary.
