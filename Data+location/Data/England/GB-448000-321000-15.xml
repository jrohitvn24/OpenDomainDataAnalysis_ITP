		<content>  People are very aware of the need to 
 take care of their bodies.It is a very
 common sight to see people jogging    
 through the villages and countryside  
 intending to keep themselves fit and  
 slim.Many of the clubs and societies  
 are well attended because of peoples  
 desire to keep themselves fit.The     
 ladies attend a Swing into Shape class
 once a week in the Community centres  
 while the men attend Karate and Weight
 training classes.                     
      Doctors surgeries are housed     
 within the villages and these are very
 convenient.If one is unwell you either
 visit the doctor at the surgery or if 
 you are very ill the doctor will visit
 you at home.Medicine can also be      
 dispenced at the Hathern surgery.Any  
 problem the doctor is unsure about is 
 referred to the hospital.
