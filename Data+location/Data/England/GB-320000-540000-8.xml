		<title>08My house in Fletchertown.</title>
		<content> I live at 9 Front Street,Fletchertown.
 The house was built for a miner and   
 his family.My grandfather used to be a
 coal miner. In my house we have got   
 two bedrooms and one attic room,which 
 we sometimes use as a bedroom.The     
 bathroom is downstairs and the kitchen
 is next to the bathroom. When the     
 house was built there was no bathroom.
 The living room is at the back of the 
 house and there is a pantry next to it
 We have a parlour at the front of the 
 house.We have a coloured television,a 
 portable television and a pool table  
 in the attic.We have two coal fires in
 the house and a gas fire.We have a    
 shower in the bathroom.At the back of 
 the house there is a yard where we    
 keep our bikes and the coal bunkers.  
 There is also a washing line and a    
 back gate,which leads out into a      
 narrow street between the houses.     </content>
