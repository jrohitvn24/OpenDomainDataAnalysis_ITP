		<title>10Transport in Uxbridge</title>
		<content>                                       
 We discovered that the traffic in     
 Uxbridge is very busy,with all kinds  
 of vehicles such as cars,buses,lorries
 and motorbikes between 7.30am-9am and 
 5pm-7pm.The quietest time for traffic 
 is just before mid-day.The most       
 popular form of transport is the car. 
 This is due to there being several    
 car-parks and a comprehensive plan of 
 motorways around Uxbridge.Out of 35   
 people we asked about their form of   
 transport,the majority used the       
 car,followed by Underground,walking   
 and then the bus.The Bus Station      
 serves several routes and the local   
 underground station serves two lines. 
 The Grand Union Canal,which runs      
 through Uxbridge is a wasted waterway,
 as it is now used for pleasure trips  
 only.
