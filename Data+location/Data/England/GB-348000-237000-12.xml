		<title>12Food Shopping in Hereford.</title>
		<content>  Most people nowadays have one big    
 shop to last a whole week. In our     
 class 77% of parents do just that,7%  
 shop twice a week,7% three times a    
 week, 7% do a huge shop once a month  
 (think of the cost!) and one person   
 goes every day.                       
   A couple of years ago a new Tesco   
{superstore}opened in the city centre, 
 and we were amazed to find that all   
 parents do most of their shopping     
 there or at one of the other large    
 supermarkets.                         
   But what about the{small local      
{shops?}We have come to the conclusion 
 that, since no one buys all their food
 from them, they are used only for odds
 and ends and in emergencies. Will the 
 situation change or will the small    
 shops go out of business? Only time   
 will tell_ we hope they don't!
