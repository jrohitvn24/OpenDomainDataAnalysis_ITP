		<content> School age children are taken by bus  
 to either Aylburton for primary and   
 junior education or into Lydney for   
 comprehensive education.              
 Policing of the area is also very     
 poor.  Again there is no police       
 station or resident policeman for the 
 village.  Fortunately there is a very 
 low crime rate, the Police come in    
 from Lydney when required.  Crime,    
 when committed is dealt with at Lydney
 Court Sessions.  The area is visited  
 regularly by Police Patrol Cars.      
 St. Andrews Church, circa 1250,       
 denomination Church of England, stands
 in the centre of the village.  It is  
 the only place of worship and church  
 services are poorly attended.  The    
 vicar is shared with the nearby       
 parish of Woolaston.
