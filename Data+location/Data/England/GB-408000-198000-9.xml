		<content>  Our survey showed that the following 
 hobbies are pursued ( in order of     
 popularity): gardening, reading,      
 television, sewing/knitting, sport,   
 photography, painting and darts.      
  The television is turned on for more 
 than 12 hours a week in 65 homes, 4-12
 hours a week in 60 homes and less than
 4 hours a week in 13 homes. Nearly all
 homes have a T.V. set and three       
 quarters have a telephone. Lack of    
 transport restricts leisure pursuits  
 in 20 homes, but in 128 it does not.  
 125 homes use cars, 25 bus, 9 cycle   
 and 8 use other means to reach venues 
 for leisure activities. In 150 homes, 
 people eat or drink out locally but 75
 prefer to stay at home; cost is a big 
 factor.Libraries are popular:49 people
 use Cirencester,15 use Fairford and 16
 use the mobile library. Two thirds of 
 the adults go to bed after  10.30 pm. </content>
