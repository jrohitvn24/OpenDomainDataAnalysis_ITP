		<content> The area is predominantly             
 agricultural, the only complete       
 village lying within its bounds being 
 the small village of Whilton, which   
 has no shop or public house and only  
 part-time post office.   There are    
 also a few houses by the canal at Long
 Buckby Wharf.   The most notable      
 feature of the area is that the M1    
 motorway and the main railway line    
 from Euston pass through it, running  
 close together for the most part,     
 together with the Grand Union Canal,  
 which runs close to the M1 and the    
 railway for part of the way.   The A5 
 trunk road also passes through the    
 area, roughly parallel to the M1.   At
 Whilton Locks the canal passes through
 a series of locks and there is a      
 marina just below the locks.
