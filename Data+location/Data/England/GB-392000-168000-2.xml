     The rural nature of the area leads
 to an abundance of wild life.         
{Principal ecological areas are around 
{the River Avon and the expanses of    
{woodland on the escarpment.           
     Families of swans exist on the    
 river together with moorhens which    
 have recently made a reappearance     
 following the disappearance of Mink.  
 There has been an increase of         
 Kingfishers nesting on the banks over 
 previous years and some sightings of  
 pairs of Coots.                       
     The Rake pond on the Lackham      
 Estate has recently been cleared with 
 additional ponds created in a         
{conservation area.}The resultant      
 increase in pond life, significantly  
 with the appearance of Mallard Duck   
 points to the success of this venture.</content>
