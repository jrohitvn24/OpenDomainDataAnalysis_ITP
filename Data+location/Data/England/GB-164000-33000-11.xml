		<title>11A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> Auntie Dosh and Uncle Joe arrived     
 with their dog called Bruce. It       
 was very big but it was only a        
 puppy. We were all excited. Bruce     
 wanted to play with our dog but our   
 dog was too scared. Soon Auntie       
 Dosh went in to help with the meal.   
 Auntie Dosh had brought some cakes,   
 bread, eggs, cheese, squash, coffee   
 and lots of other things for us.      
 Debbie and I did the tables and we    
 had our meal. After our meal we had   
 to tidy up our bedroom because mum    
 said that they could stay for a       
 night or two. That evening we were    
 very busy making beds for them all.   
 When the beds were made we each in    
 turn got washed. It took us a very    
 long time to fall asleep because we   
 were all very excited.                
                                       
                                       </content>
