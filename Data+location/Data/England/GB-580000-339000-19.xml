		<title>19HISTORY OF BURNHAM MARKET</title>
		<content>    Although this area is known as     
 Burnham Market, there is no such      
 parish, and the survey area is made up
 of parts of the parishes of Burnham   
 Westgate and Burnham Sutton. The      
 parishes were more densely populated  
 in the middle ages, and the Black     
 Death (1348) was responsible for their
 decline. The ruins of St Ethelbert's  
 Church, Burnham Sutton, are next to   
 the village hall. This church became  
 redundant and was partially demolished
 in 1771, the parish being linked to   
 that of Burnham Ulph at that time.    
    Beacon Hill is the reputed site of 
 one of a series of beacon fires which 
 were lit to warn the people of Norfolk
 of Danish invaders. The beacon was lit
 again in 1977 as one of a chain of    
 beacon fires to celebrate the silver  
 jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II.
