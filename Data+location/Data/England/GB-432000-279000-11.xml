		<content> Holy Trinity Church is about 5OO years
 old. After the Second World War two   
 damaged windows were replaced. On each
 wall there are four big windows       
 telling the story of Jesus. The roof, 
 supported by tall arched columns has  
 beautiful shapes and pictures of      
 angels. St. Mary's Hall, also         
 mediaeval, contains a tapestry woven  
 around 1485 specially for Henry VII's 
 visit to Coventry. This shows saints  
 and other important people and was    
 removed during W.W.2. and replaced    
 afterwards. Carvings of animals cover 
 the Guildmaster's chair now used by   
 the Mayor. The city treasury was in   
 Caesar's Tower. The door to the room  
 and the treasure chest each have 3    
 locks, 3 people had to be present to  
 obtain money.
