		<title>08HOUSES IN LOCAL VILLAGES</title>
		<content>  Houses in the four villages were     
 quite similar: In all of the villages 
 there was a mixture of new housing    
 developments alongside older          
 dwellings. The older houses tended to 
 be clustered around the village       
 church, whilst the newer houses were  
 added on the outskirts of the         
 villages.                             
  The older houses were built of local 
 stone and it was apparent that the new
 houses had been carefully designed to 
 fit into the environment.             
  The village of Stibbington contained 
 some Local Authority dwellings but    
 most of the houses were privately     
 owned. House prices in all of the     
 villages were on average higher than  
 those in the wider area due to the    
 many attractions of village life.
