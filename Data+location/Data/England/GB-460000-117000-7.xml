		<title>07Recreation Fishing Meon</title>
		<content> The river Meon flows alongside        
 Droxford on its way to Hill Head.At   
 weekends the banks are crowded like a 
 beach.It is a clear chalk stream at   
 most 6M wide.It is diverted from the  
 millstream forming a rush deep enough 
 to swim in.The Meon is good for       
 fishing:there are trout,gudgeon,bull_ 
 heads,minnows,crayfish and eels.A     
 fibreglass rod is best with weights,  
 floats,a reel and landing nets.We fly 
 ledger and coarse fish.Bait:_ worms,  
 bread,minnows and maggots.Sometimes   
 herons are seen flying above the river
 One house has a trout pond.Sheep graze
 by the river in winter.The mill has   
 just changed hands.A few homes in the 
 village have swimming pools.School    
 children learn to swim at Bishops     
 Waltham_Ridgemede School.They also    
 learn the Blue Cross water safety     
 code.                                 </content>
