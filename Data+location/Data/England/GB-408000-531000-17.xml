		<title>17CHILDREN'S PASTIMES</title>
		<content>   The junior school children indicated
 in a questionnaire that they liked the
 quiet environment in which they lived,
 but almost all complained of lack of  
 friends.Of the 14 children involved   
 none played organised games or had    
 favourite games.The Youth Club which  
 meets weekly,caters for the ages 9-16 
 but only 6 of the juniors attend. 8 of
 the children have no regular friends  
 and a similar number have no real     
 interests or hobbies.Most have access,
 in the home,to 2 televisions,radio,   
 record player and tape recorder,whilst
 about half can use video,home computer
 and T.V. games.Television is in daily 
 use and oral questioning suggests     
 excessive viewing time especially in  
 winter and at weekends. Other audio   
 visual aids are used occasionally.Most
 read for pleasure for about an hour a 
 week and mainly in bed.               </content>
