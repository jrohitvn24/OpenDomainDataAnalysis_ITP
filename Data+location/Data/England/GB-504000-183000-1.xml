		<title>01A general view of Uxbridge</title>
		<content> The former market town of Uxbridge    
 is today the administrative centre of 
 Hillingdon Borough.Its Civic Centre is
 a landmark in modern civic            
 architecture.West of the town lies the
 rural district of Denham in           
 Buckinghamshire.London is 16 miles    
 away and Heathrow Airport is four     
 miles to the south.The A40/M40 and M4 
 motorways are close at hand,and a     
 section of the M25 motorway is under  
 construction to the west.Uxbridge is a
 terminus for the Metropolitan and     
 Piccadilly lines of the London        
 Underground system.These factors      
 explain why much office development   
 has taken place in the town           
 recently,and contiues today.East of   
 the town lies the Royal Air Force     
 Station,an administrative             
 headquarters which includes the home  
 of the R.A.F.Central Band.            </content>
