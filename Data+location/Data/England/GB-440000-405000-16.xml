		<title>16A Mechanical Digger at Work.</title>
		<content> There was a J.C.B. working outside our
 school. We watched it digging a trench
 in the road. They are putting new     
 pipes down along{School Street.}      
 The J.C.B.is a{mechanical digger.}It  
 has ascoop on an arm which pivots, and
 a cab for the driver who works the    
 controls. The digger is scooping out  
 the trench and lifting the earth up   
 and putting it into a{lorry.}When the{
{lorry}is full it drives off.          
 The driver operates a lever to make   
 the shovel work. While he is digging  
 he has like metal legs down. He has a 
 swivel chair, and he operates the     
 digger by moving a lever left, right, 
 to the middle and sideways.           
 Sometimes the driver lifts the legs to
 move the J.C.B. forwards to dig in    
 another place.
