		<content> To the South West lie the small       
 villages of Little Warley, with its   
 'Greyhound' public house, and         
 Childerditch, hidden away in its      
 quiet rural cul-de-sac off            
 Childerditch Lane.                    
  From the top of Jury Hill in the     
 south a panoramic view of the Thames  
 Estuary and the hills of Kent can be  
 had on a clear day and looking to the 
 West the London skyline some 25 miles 
 away can be seen.                     
  For those who enjoy a round of golf, 
 three Golf Clubs are available; two   
 private, Thorndon Park and Warley     
 Park, and one public to the North at  
 Hart's Wood Park.                     
  The farmland at the centre is        
 dominated by the unusual collonaded   
 farm buildings of Hatch Farm          
                                       
                                       </content>
