		<title>10Growing Christmas trees</title>
		<content>      Among the many conifer tree      
 plantations are areas of young{Norway 
{Spruce}which are grown for sale in    
{December}as{Christmas trees.          
      By doing this the owner of the   
 woodland can get some return on his   
 investment more quickly than waiting  
 for the woodland to mature.           
      The trees are usually{bought as  
{seedlings}from a forestry nursery and 
 planted early in the year. It is      
 important that they get{enough rain   
 after planting. The trees are also at 
 risk from{animals}and{fire.           
      In December, after a few years   
 growth, they are harvested. Most      
 growers cut them down because this    
 costs less but if they can be dug up  
 they can be replanted in a garden     
 after Christmas.                      
      The trees are{sold by length}and 
 cost over a{pound a foot.             </content>
