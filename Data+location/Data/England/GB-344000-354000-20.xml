		<title>20We Move To A Village</title>
		<content> Two years ago my family moved from a  
 lively suburb of Chester to the       
 country village of Coddington. The    
 children in my family are aged        
 17,16,13,10 and 7.                    
 After two years in the country we     
 older three still prefer town living. 
 The main differences are that in      
 Chester we had a regular Youth club   
 and frequent bus service, whilst here 
 there is nothing to do and no evening 
 buses. The younger ones enjoy living  
 in the country, as there is more      
 freedom and closeness to nature.      
 My father continues his milk round in 
 Chester although it means a lot of    
 travelling and rising at 2.30am each  
 day. My mother joins in village life  
 attending church and Womens Institute.
 I am now staying on at school after 16
 to gain more qualifications to try to 
 get a job when I leave school.        </content>
