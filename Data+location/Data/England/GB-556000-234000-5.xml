		<title>05Queen Mother at Wimbish</title>
		<content> On Friday 28th June,{Her Majesty the  
{Queen Mother}came to Carver Barracks, 
 Wimbish, for the Tercentenary         
 Celebrations of the 1st Queens Dragoon
 Guards. She arrived in the red Royal  
 helicopter and landed at 11a.m. It was
 a long wait until she came. She wore a
 yellow dress and hat with a green     
 veil. She met the Guides, Cubs and    
 Brownies but went right past the      
 Scouts! The Queen Mother is           
 Colonel-in-Chief of the regiment and  
 so she inspected the Guard of Honour. 
 She saw a tank charge with all the    
 tanks going at 40mph. She went to the 
 Officers Mess for lunch. I gave her   
 some flowers. I curtsied and was so   
 nervous I never listened to what she  
 said and just said "yes" all the time.
{Princess Anne and Captain Mark        
{Phillips}came to the Ball in the      
 evening. The Queen Mother left at 5pm.</content>
