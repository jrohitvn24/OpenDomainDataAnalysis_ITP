		<content>{BRIGHTLINGSEA BEACH.                  
  A small pebbly beach lies on the East
 side of the Colne estuary. It attracts
 little tourist trade compared with    
 Clacton, Walton and Frinton further   
 along the coast. However, its lack of 
 commercialism has considerable appeal.
 On the beach, a large area has been   
 enclosed to form a safe paddling pool 
 for little children. This is necessary
 because, at low tide, wide areas of   
 mud are exposed, and at high tide,    
 currents can be dangerous.            
{ THE COLNE ESTUARY}offers a wide open 
 landscape of water, mud flats and     
 marshes from which the farmland rises 
 gradually to low hills. Numerous      
 yachts take advantage of the creeks   
 and open sea to the south, whilst     
 small cargo ships bound for           
 Colchester Hythe, Rowhedge and        
 Wivenhoe wait for the tide to turn.   </content>
