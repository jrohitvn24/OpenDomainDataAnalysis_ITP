		<title>05HOUSING IN BISHOP MIDDLEHAM</title>
		<content> Of the area covered in the survey     
 block,the village of Bishop Middleham 
 accounts for most of the housing; the 
 rest being predominantly scattered    
 farmhouses.                           
 There are few large old stone         
 buildings in the village. Of these The
 Hall, Hall Farmhouse, The Old Vicarage
 and the Manor House remain.           
 The oldest streets in the village are 
 mainly terraced. Later developments   
 also favour terraced two storey       
 buildings and bungalows.              
 Two estates have been completed fairly
 recently and these incorporate a      
 variety of house styles including     
 detached,semi-detached,terraced and   
 bungalows.
