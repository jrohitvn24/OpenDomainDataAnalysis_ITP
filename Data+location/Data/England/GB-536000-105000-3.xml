		<title>03WOODINGDEAN : FAMILY OUTINGS</title>
		<content> We often go for walks from our house  
 across the Downs.They are always very 
 long.Sometimes we start at Sunblest   
 Bakery and walk along Jugg's Lane to  
 Kingston, or we go down Old Parish    
 Lane to the beach. We sometimes see   
 animals but not very often. Once we   
 saw an Adder. There are badgers, foxes
 and rabbits living on the Downs behind
 our houses. You have to go out very   
 late to see them. Sometimes we all go 
 to Happy Valley Park, or we play on   
 the green near us. If we want to have 
 a meal out, we have to go outside     
 Woodingdean. We always buy fish and   
 chips on Saturday night.
