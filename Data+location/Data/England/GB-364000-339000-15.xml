 We start school at nine o'clock. In   
 the morning we do English and Maths,  
 but on Tuesday we go swimming at the  
 Whitchurch swimming baths. At lunch   
 time we have several different meals  
 to choose from.After lunch we play    
 outside on the climbing frames or we  
 might play Cricket or Football. In the
 afternoon we do study work and        
 sometimes we may have a story before  
 school finishes.  On Wednesday we do  
 games until 4 o'clock.I think that    
 school is alright.I have lots of      
 friends.We have a school library,we   
 are able to borrow books from it.In   
 1985 Adderley school won a 5 a side   
 football cup .In 1984 we won the      
 swimming gala at Whitchurch.Lots of   
 things happen at our small school.
