		<content>   The Danish Army in the 10th Century 
 established farms next to Saxon       
 villages and called them Throp or     
 Thorpe,the Danish for out-lying farms.
 Here the village was called Lilbourne.
 The manor was siezed by the Caht      
 family and became Thorpe Caht,now     
 known as{Catthorpe.}                  
   A siege castle was built overlooking
 Lilbourne Castle but in 1147 the Earl 
 of Leicester signed a Peace-Pact with 
 Warwickshire and by 1218 the castle   
 was redundant.                        
  {Dow}bridge(Celtic-Dubh meaning river
 bank)was built in the Iron Age and was
 later improved by the Romans to carry 
 Watling St.(The Shire Stone was       
 removed during World War 2 but has    
 never been replaced.)                 
   The only famous person from         
 Catthorpe is{John Dyer}best known for 
  his poem  "The Fleece".              </content>
