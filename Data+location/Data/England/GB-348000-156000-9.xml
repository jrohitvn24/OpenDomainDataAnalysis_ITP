		<content> In May 1985 we took a party of our    
 children to{Duporth}near{St.Austell,  
{Cornwall}where we spent a week doing  
 various activities like table tennis, 
 learning how to abseil,how to fire a  
 bow in archery,to understand the rules
 in crazy golf,how to fence in the     
 proper way, using the foil, how to use
 a compass in the initiative tests, how
 to dribble with the ball in basketball
 and to shoot into the net.In our      
 gymnastics we were taught how to do   
 proper forward rolls and cartwheels.  
 Other activities included swimming,   
 beach studies, football and tennis.At 
 night there were various things to do 
 like watching videos, discos, concerts
 and beach parties. We had football,   
 basketball and 'Superteams'           
 competitions, organised as evening    
 activities. It was great fun. I hope  
 I will be able to go again next year! </content>
