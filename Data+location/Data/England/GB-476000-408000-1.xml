		<content> 'Woodhouse' is an extensive area of   
 flat agricultural land with a         
 profusion of drains and ditches.      
 These are a legacy of the drainage of 
 the area by the Dutch engineer        
 Vermuyden in the early 17th Century.  
 The M180 travels east-west across the 
 area and a junction is formed with the
 A161 Goole-Gainsborough road, one mile
 north of the village of Belton.  The  
 only residents of the area live in    
 scattered farmsteads.  One larger     
 building is Hirst Priory.  This once  
 was a priory but is now a family home 
 though the grounds provide the venue  
 for a local cricket club.
