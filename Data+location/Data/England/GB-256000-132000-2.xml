		<content>   My Dad likes betting on horses.     
 Every Saturday he gets out his tickets
 and decides which horses he is going  
 to bet on.From then on no-one is      
 allowed to watch television.My Dad    
 doesn't normally win anything but one 
 day he won Â£407,but he does put a lot 
 on the horses.Nearly every day he bets
 Â£5.                                   
   My Mum likes to do crosswords in the
 newspaper. Every day no-one can have  
 the news before she does. She can do  
 crosswords for hours until my Dad     
 comes home.My sister always gets me   
 into trouble because if she hits me   
 and then I hit her I'm the one who    
 gets in trouble. She can go out to    
 play until about 7 o'clock and then   
 she goes to bed about 8 o'clock. My   
 sister is 6 and she also goes to      
 Forches Cross school.
