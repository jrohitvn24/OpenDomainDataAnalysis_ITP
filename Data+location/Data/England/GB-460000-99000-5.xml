		<title>05TYPICAL DAY IN BUCKLAND</title>
		<content>            My Home.                   
      I live in a house with my Mum and
 Dad and my brother and sister. Our    
 house is quite old and we bought it   
 when we moved in. The area I live in  
 is{Buckland,}Portsmouth. In our house 
 we have three bedrooms, a living room,
 kitchen and bathroom.                 
      The area I live in is quite nice.
 We have{corner shops}on the right and 
 left hand side of our street which    
 sell everything. These are quite      
 handy because one is a newsagents and 
 one is a grocers which also sells all 
 sorts of things that you can run out  
 of.                                   
      On{May Day}we  had a{street party
 in our road. We had to pay but a lot  
 of the things were free, like fish and
 chips. The children were given T      
 shirts, pens and little gifts.
