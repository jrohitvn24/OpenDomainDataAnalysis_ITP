 In our survey we found out that most  
 people used colour television to      
 watch television programmes, only     
 four used portable television. The    
 most hours people viewed television   
 or played television games was between
 one and three hours on a weekday and  
 between one and six hours at the      
 weekend. The most viewing on a weekday
 was eight hours and the most viewing  
 at the weekend was also eight hours.  
                                       
 In Alne we went asking people which   
 television programme they watched the 
 most. Some said drama and adventure   
 series. The most said drama and all   
 types of progammes. Most of the old   
 people liked adventure series like    
 Murder She Wrote and the A_Team.      
 Younger people liked comedies.        </content>
