		<content> On 9th April 1970,Hollinhey C.P.School
 opened on the closure of Sutton       
 St.James' C.E.School and Langley      
 C.P.School.Children come to it mainly 
 from within the civil parish of       
 Sutton.In 1973 it had nearly 250      
 pupils on roll but the number of      
 children has steadily fallen owing to 
 the decline in the national birthrate 
 to just over 160.Today it has five    
 full time teachers plus a headmaster,a
 caretaker and two cleaners,a cook and 
 two assistants ,one classroom         
 assistant and a clerical assistant for
 ten hours per week.Children start     
 at the beginning of the term in which 
 they will be five,most having         
 previously attended St.James'Playgroup
 and at eleven go mainly to            
 Macclesfield County High school       
 although this year a larger number    
 have opted for other county schools.  </content>
