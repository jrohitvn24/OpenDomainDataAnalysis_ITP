		<title>01Lundy Island-the North.</title>
		<content> Lundy falls into 3 D blocks.For       
 reasons of convenience and space all  
 those things that relate to the       
 ecology of the island are dealt with  
 in this section,as are the children's 
 experiences.Likewise the history and  
 details of tourism are dealt with in  
 the south.The main settlement is in   
 the central section.                  
 Lundy lies 11 miles off the North     
 Devon coast.It is owned by the        
 National Trust and run by the Landmark
 Trust.There is a small resident       
 population and its main industry is   
 tourism-with some farming.The island  
 has a supply ship and a weekly        
 helicopter service.                   
 Although only 3 miles long and about  
 half a mile wide there is a wealth of 
 interest,historical and ecological,   
 along with magnificent scenery and    
 peace that is almost total.           </content>
