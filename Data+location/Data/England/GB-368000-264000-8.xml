		<content> There is a strong community spirit in 
 the area, although each village has a 
 slightly differing local 'flavour'.   
                                       
 In Stanford,the only village          
 completely within our geographical    
 block, many social gatherings are     
 arranged as fund raising events for   
 the church, including a biennial      
 garden party,a barbecue,a raft race   
 down the Teme and car boot sales.     
 During the winter months regular whist
 drives are held in the Village Hall   
 and monthly gourmet meals.  The       
 Womens' Institute  hold their         
 monthly meetings in the Hall.  A      
 childrens' party and a luncheon for   
 the elderly are provided at Christmas.
