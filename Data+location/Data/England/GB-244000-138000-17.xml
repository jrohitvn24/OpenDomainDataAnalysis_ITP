  There have been 4 new estates built  
 in Georgeham in the last 15 years and 
 there is one being built now thats    
 Williamson Close.That will have 8     
 houses on it and because they will be 
 new houses with all the new technology
 the builders can afford to build them 
 on a very steep hill.Davids Hill is   
 aiso on quite a steep hill and over   
 looks Wiliamson Close.Davids Hill is  
 the biggest estate in Georgeham with  
 48 houses.The smallest estate is an   
 estate along Chaple Street with 4     
 houses on it .The other two estates   
 are Putsborough close with 10 houses  
 and Longland Lane with 26 houses both 
 of these estates are on flat ground   
 but out of the new estates they are   
 oldest.There are now more new houses  
 in Georgeham than old.
