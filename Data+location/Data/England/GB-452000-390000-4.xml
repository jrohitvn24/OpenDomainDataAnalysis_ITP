		<content> The area comprises Grades 2 and 3     
 agricultural land.  As a lowland      
 area,with fertile calcareous brown    
 earth soils, and a rainfall of about  
 675mm per annum the physical factors  
 are highly favourable to arable       
 farming. The leading crops are peas,  
 barley,wheat,potatoes and oilseed     
 rape. The rapid expansion of rape has 
 been a feature of the last decade.    
 Another change hs been the increase in
 the winter sowing of barley. The area 
 has Â£een spared the worst effects of  
 "prairie" farming,though some hedges  
 have been removed. Hedgerows and woods
 are retained by shooting interests.   
 Grassland tends to occupy steeper     
 slopes and less well drained meadows. 
 Though most farms are arable, mixed   
 farms have sheep or dairy and beef    
 cattle utilising both grass and       
 fodder.                               </content>
