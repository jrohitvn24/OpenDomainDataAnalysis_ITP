		<content>This is a list of all the people in my 
family that I can think of. Aunty Pat, 
Paula and Margaret. Uncle Tom, Frank   
and Graham. Great uncle Fred. Mum, Dad 
Emma(sister). Cousin Christopher, Kate,
Brian and Jackie and Grandma. I have   
got two pets one is a harliquin rabbit,
the other is a cat called Tiger. My mum
is called Joan, and she is a nurse who 
works at Shenstone Surgery. My dad's   
name is Peter and he is a plumber. My  
sister is called Emma she is in the    
second year of King Edward's School    
Lichfield. We have got a shed down our 
garden, and on sunday 30th of June me  
and Jane Alexander were in the shed. I 
went up to the house on my way up,     
Brian Fisher threw a stone as big as an
egg, and it hit me on the head.
