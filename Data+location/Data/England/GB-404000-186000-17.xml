		<title>17Teenage life in Braydon</title>
		<content> An interview with a 19 year old from  
 Braydon revealed that he was born in  
 Braydon and educated in Purton.       
    He was employed on a farm and      
 enjoyed his work, In the winter his   
 working day started at 6am and        
 finished at 6.30pm. In the summer he  
 worked until dusk if needed.          
    His social time was linked with the
 Young Farmers programme of activities.
 He also enjoyed watching films on TV  
 or on video and listening to pop music
 (particularly the independant         
 stations).                            
    Traditional English foods were his 
 favourites, for example roast beef and
 yorkshire pudding with vegetables. His
 breakfast consisted of a bowl of      
 cereal.                               
    He was very contented with his life
 and preferred his own fairly isolated 
 home to living in a town or village.  </content>
