		<title>01Thursley and Bowlhead Green</title>
		<content> The southern half of the block is     
 farmland. Most of the fields are sown 
 and fertilised grass; there is a      
 smaller acreage of maize and fruit,   
 some deciduous woodland and ponds     
 developed for fish farming/  The A3   
 splits the hamlet of Bowlhead Green   
 from the old village of Thursley and  
 the new mobile-home park, and provides
 a speedway to jobs, shops and mainline
 stations.  The original church at     
 Thursley was Saxon and the houses are 
 brick, stone and timber-framed.  Many 
 are occupied by retired people/  The  
 northern half is heath with a few     
 narrow belts of pine and a scattering 
 of self-sown birch and pine. Part is  
 owned by the Ministry of Defence and  
 used for army training.  The lowland  
 heathland of Thursley Common is a     
 National Nature reserve, owned by the 
 Nature Conservancy Council.           </content>
