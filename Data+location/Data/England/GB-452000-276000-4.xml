		<content>   The school was built in 1850. It was
 able to accommodate 173 children.     
 Today, there are only 43 5-8 year olds
 who attend the school. The children   
 live in Clifton and the neighbouring  
 parish of Newton.                     
   There is a V.G. grocer's shop,post  
 office,picture framing gallery and a  
 hairdressing salon.The mobile library 
 visits the village once a fortnight.  
   The Townsend Memorial Hall is used  
 for many social functions,including   
 meetings of the local history society.
 The church youth group meet in the    
 church crypt.Various groups hire the  
 school for activities as fencing and  
 "keep-fit".                           
   Both the North Oxford Canal and the 
 main London railway line skirt the    
 edge of Clifton.Part of the dismantled
 railway line also crosses the northern
 fringe of the village.                </content>
