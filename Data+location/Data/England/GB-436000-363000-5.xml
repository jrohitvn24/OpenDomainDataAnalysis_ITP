		<content>   I belong to the swimming club,called
 Ryknelds,at the leisure centre and    
 people round this area also belong.It 
 is held on a Wednesday and Friday from
 7.15 p.m.to 8.15 p.m.At the swimming  
 club we have galas, swim races and do 
 life saving. We can win trophies and  
 medals.I have got my bronze,silver and
 gold awards.When we start it is Â£8 per
 year and each time I go it is 30p.When
 l started l could not swim, then l    
 swam my 10 metres, so l moved up to   
 the other half of the little pool.I   
 swam my 30 metres and went into the   
 big pool.I have moved from the 2nd    
 lane up to the 5th lane.It is hard    
 work in the 5th lane.We swim 25       
 lengths as a warm up. Altogether we   
 swim about 100 lengths each time.     
 We have diving competitions,and race  
 against children in the fourth and    
 fifth lanes.I love swimming.          </content>
