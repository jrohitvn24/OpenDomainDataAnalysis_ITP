		<title>11THE CORNISH PASTY</title>
		<content> In the olden days pasties were marked 
 with the initial of its eater since   
 the contents of the pasty varied and  
 often still do today,to suit different
 tastes-vegetables,different meats,    
 fruit or jam. The initial end was     
 always eaten last so that if the pasty
 was not finished it could be reclaimed
 by its owner. The usual pasty however 
 is filled with potatoes, turnip and   
 meat and is a complete meal. This made
 it convenient to take into the fields 
 or down the mine. Also made of barley 
 flour the traditional pasty was heavy 
 and hard-hard enough it is said to be 
 dropped down a mine shaft without     
 breaking.Nowadays pasty making is an  
 important industry and shops and pubs 
 sell mass-produced pasties in very    
 large number.It is important to       
 remember that the ingredients should  
 be placed raw inside the pastry case. </content>
