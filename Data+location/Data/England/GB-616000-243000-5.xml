		<title>05The Ancient House Ipswich</title>
		<content> The Ancient House has been a bookshop 
for a long time but in the last couple 
of years all the books have been moved 
to a modern building,for the Ancient   
House to be cleaned up.                
 On the outside wall of the Ancient    
house there are engravings in the wood 
of different countries.One main country
of today is missing from those         
engravings,it is America.The reason is 
because America had not been discovered
at the time the Ancient House was      
built.                                 
 The Ancient House used to be called   
the Sparrowe House and is described in 
books as a Tudor mansion.              
 For years the Ancient House has been  
used for business and it probably go on
being used for business in the future.
