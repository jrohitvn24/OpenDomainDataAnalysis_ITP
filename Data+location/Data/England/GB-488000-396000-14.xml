 Meetings are held monthly in Scotton, 
 every other month in Northorpe; 4-5   
 members of the public attend Scotton  
 meetings as observers, 35-40 come to  
 the Open Annual Parish Meeting in May.
 Matters discussed include planning,   
 finance, rights of way, stubble       
 burning, road maintenance and (in
