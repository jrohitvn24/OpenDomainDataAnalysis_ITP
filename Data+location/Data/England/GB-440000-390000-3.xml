  "Devastating effects of the Decline  
 revealed".  A recent survey undertaken
 by the coalfield communities campaign,
 shows the effects of industrial       
 decline. Unemployment runs at 21% and 
 the town is one of the worst hit areas
 in the country with little prospect of
 improvement. The knock on effects are 
 reflected in the numerous calls for   
 social service help. Since 1980, free 
 school meals have doubled to 9,810,   
 clothing grants 190 to 6628 and       
 maintenance awards have trebled from  
 54 to 154.  the social services       
 department has 34% increase in cases  
 and dealt with 15,000 referrals last  
 year.  There are housing difficulties 
 and rent arrears went up to 35% from  
 25% with 19,582 people claiming rent  
 rebates this year.
