		<title>11Unfinished Church CSP</title>

In Oval Way,a residential road not far 
from Gerrards Cross Station,is an un-  
finished church.It consists of 1/3 of  
the original building planned!         
                                       
All Saints Church was begun in 1912 but
because of World War 1 was unfinished. 
After the war,the expected housing     
development near the new station never 
took place so a large church was not   
needed.The designer was Temple Moore.  
Only the north aisle exsists.          
The church abruptly ends at one side in
a rough wall.In recent years stained   
glass windows have been put in that    
wall.Inside are 3 sanctuary lamps      
dedicated in the memory of a local     
soldier killed at Passchendaele.The    
church,unfinished though it is,is now a
listed building,as the oak woodwork    
inside is very fine.                   </content>
