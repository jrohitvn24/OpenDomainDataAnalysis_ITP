		<title>14THE PEOPLE OF PETT LEVEL I</title>
		<content> Householders in this area are in the  
 main, retired people. Any who are     
 still employed would go out of the    
 area to work.There are farmers, but no
 farm labourers, two doctors still in  
 practice live here, but there is no   
 surgery.                              
 One policeman, shared by other        
 parishes, patrols the area. There are 
 approximately 20 children of school   
 age who would attend Guestling Primary
 or Thomas Peacocke Secondary School in
 Rye. There is no organised social     
 life, but the impression I get when   
 talking to the people is-they would   
 not want to live anywhere else.
