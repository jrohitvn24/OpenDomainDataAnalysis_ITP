		<title>02The Enterprise Zone, Corby</title>
		<content>With the closure of the steelworks     
Corby was designated as the first      
Enterprise zone in the country on 22nd 
June, 1981, so that new industries     
could be attracted to supply jobs for  
the unemployed. The zone provides      
exemptions from land rates, 100% income
tax allowances on capital expenditure  
on buildings, no industrial development
certificates and simplified planning   
procedures in an effort to pursue      
industrial regeneration.               
280 acres of land were designated and  
are divided into three zones,          
Earlstrees,109acres, Weldon South 38.67
acres and Weldon North, 132 acres.     
All three zones are now completely     
filled with light industrial factories 
providing thousands of new jobs in the 
area
