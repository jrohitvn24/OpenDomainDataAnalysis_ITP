		<title>18Popham's Pit, Blackdowns</title>
		<content> At Oulescombe Bottom near the Monument
 lies Popham's Pit a sinister gully.   
 Stout fences protect bogs and tangled 
 undergrowth from fields around.There  
 Sir John Popham Lord Chief Justice for
 James 1st vanished while hunting from 
 his home, Wellington Court.He presided
 at trials of Guy Fawkes and Raleigh.  
 Due to his reputation in some quarters
 he was thought to have entered one of 
 the'Mouths to Hell'.His wife's piety  
 caused the Devil to grant the ghost of
 Sir John should emerge annually and   
 advance'one cock's stride' towards his
 wife's tomb in Wellington. An oak tree
 grew upon the site of his death.Locals
 wished to be rid of his spirit        
 persuaded a saintly old ploughman,    
 bible in hand,leading yoked oxen,     
 singing psalms,to uproot the tree. The
 spirit escaped to Park Farm,later     
 exorcised and returned to Popham's Pit</content>
