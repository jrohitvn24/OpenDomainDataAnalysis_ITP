		<title>17CHEDWORTH MANOR.</title>
		<content>   Chedworth manor lies south of the   
 church.                               
   The Normans normally built the manor
 an arrow shot away from the church    
 tower,to act as an administative body 
 of the village.The manor was          
 originally a farm_house sited on a    
 natural spring of water.              
   In Victorian times it was possible  
 to pump water farther up the hill to  
 the new farm buildings.There is a     
 Tithe barn across the lawn as big as  
 the chancel of the church.The Tithe   
 was a kind of tax it was one tenth of 
 a mans earnings.                      
   In 1485 Chedworth church was        
 rebuilt,the fine windows were probably
 paid for by the money that was coming 
 from the wool trade.The Black Death   
 had killed so many people that there  
 were few left to work the land.
