		<content> A representative poll taken in the    
 block shows that:Most inhabitants work
 either in Cambridge or within the     
 block.Many fathers who work in the    
 Abington area are self employed       
 horticulturists or farmers.Other      
 fathers are professionals such as     
 engineers, scientists and directors.A 
 few people work in London, Saffron    
 Walden and Bishop Stortford and some  
 more travel for work.Only a little    
 over half the mothers work and those  
 that do work, work part time and      
 within the block ,mostly in Abington  
 The block is served by good roads -   
 A604 to Cambridge and the A11 and M11 
 to London.This makes the area         
 attractive to people who travel,making
 our block a home and using the roads  
 to travel to work.
