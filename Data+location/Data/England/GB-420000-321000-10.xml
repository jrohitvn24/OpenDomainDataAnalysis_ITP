		<title>10A SHOP-KEEPER IN BURTON</title>
		<content>   Mrs. Jackets owns a fabric and      
haberdashery shop in a secondary       
shopping area in Burton. She financed  
the shop by selling her house, and now 
serves around a thousand customers a   
week, with the help of two part-time   
staff. Mrs. Jackets puts in a full day 
at the shop, and many hours over-time. 
   Although Burton is not a huge town, 
it is a growing one, and being a       
brewery town it has never suffered     
large-scale unemployment,so it is a    
good place to run a shop, although     
many people prefer to have a day out   
shopping in one of the larger cities   
that are only an hour's drive away. As 
it is not in the main shopping centre, 
some customers are lost because        
parking is poor.In spite of high rates,
Mrs.Jackets enjoys her work, especially
meeting people, buying fabrics,and     
being her own boss.                    </content>
