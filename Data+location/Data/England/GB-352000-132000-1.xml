		<title>01GENERAL IMPRESSION OF AREA</title>
		<content>    This is a rural, low-lying area    
 with the most of the land about       
 30m.above sea level but with one part 
 rising to 75m. Much of the area is    
 water meadow, known as moorland, which
 is mud-rock and very damp. The area is
 largely grassland used for grazing    
 cattle. Drainage is necessary and the 
 fields contain a network of drainage  
 ditches, locally called Rhynes. These 
 are linked to the River Brue which    
 flows through the area. The three     
 centres of population, Butleigh,      
 Barton St.David and Baltonsborough are
 situated on slightly higher ground.   
 There are also two hamlets and        
 eighteen farms. Buildings date back to
 the fourteenth century but much       
 development has taken place since     
 1950. As there is little opportunity  
 for employment in the area most of the
 inhabitants work elsewhere.           </content>
