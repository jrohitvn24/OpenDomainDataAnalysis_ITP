		<title>15COOMBE ROYAL HOME</title>
		<content>{COOMBE ROYAL}is a residential home for
 elderly and senior citizens.          
 The people who live here are usually  
 unable to cope on their own any more  
 or simply don't like living alone.    
 They come from all walks of life and  
 all have stories to tell.             
 The house and gardens are very lovely.
 There are arbours and Peacocks and    
 lawns to enjoy.Some of the residents  
 are sad not to have their own home and
 some are lonely.It is too far to      
 walk into the town.                   
 It is maintained by the South Hams    
 District Council.                     
 The house has a fascinating history   
 that includes mystery and fire!       
 There are 25 bedrooms and the house   
 usually takes up to 28 residents.     
 Elderly relatives sometimes go        
 for short periods while the family go 
 away.(eg..on Holiday)                 </content>
