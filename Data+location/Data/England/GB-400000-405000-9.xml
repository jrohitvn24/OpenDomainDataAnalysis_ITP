		<content> This was opened in 1816 &amp; was situated
 at Running Hill. It was reputed to be 
 less severe than many of the similar  
 establishments throughout the country.
 At one time known as Saddleworth      
 Union, it linked Boundary Park in     
 Oldham &amp; Crossley Moor, where inmates 
 were finally taken. Such institutions 
 were very necessary in the early 19th.
 century due to the growth in the local
 textile industry because of national  
 variations in the trade cycle. It is  
 said that very soon, Saddleworth      
 Workhouse was giving weekly relief to 
 over 3000 people, at a time when the  
 average weekly earnings for local     
 weavers was only 5/-. The residents   
 were utilised in several ways,        
 including carting coal from Diggle    
 Station, which was down the hill. The 
 workhouse closed in the 1930's &amp; is   
 now Running Hill Farm (Shepherds).    </content>
