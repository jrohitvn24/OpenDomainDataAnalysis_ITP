		<title>18YALDING CHURCHES &amp; GHOSTS</title>
		<content>                                       
 Both Nettlestead and Yalding parish   
 churches belong to the Church of      
 England. The priest in charge of St   
 Mary, Nettlestead, is the Reverend    
 Peter Haynes of East Peckham, who is  
 also priest in charge of East Peckham.
 The vicar of St Peter and St Paul,    
 Yalding, is the Reverend Peter        
 Wilkinson who lives in Yalding and has
 also care of Laddingford and Collier  
 Street parishes. Other religious      
 denominations are not represented,    
 Yalding Baptist Church being now      
 converted to a Youth Centre. As far as
 can be ascertained there are, perhaps 
 surprisingly, no houses in the area   
 which are reputed to be haunted.      
 However, the extension of Windmill    
 Path from Mount Avenue, Yalding, to   
 Lughorse Lane is said to be haunted. A
 murder is said to have occurred there.</content>
