		<title>12Pubs in Colney Heath</title>
		<content> In Colney Heath there are four pubs.  
 They are called {The Queen's Head,    
{The Crooked Billet, The  Chalkdrawers 
 and{The Cock. The Crooked Billet}got  
 its name because a billet is a log and
 it's crooked as well.{The Cock}got its
 name because they had cock fighting   
 over on the common. In cock fighting  
 people bet which cock would win.{The  
{Queen's Head }might have got its name 
 because Lady Jane Grey or Mary Queen  
 of Scots got their heads chopped      
 off. {The Chalkdrawers}got its name   
 because they used to dig up chalk to  
 improve the fields. There were two    
 other pubs{The Gardeners Arms}and     
{The Plough.
