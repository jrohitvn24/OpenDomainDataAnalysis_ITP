		<content> Most people we talked to went to the  
 theatre sometime. Half went between   
 four and twelve times a year the rest 
 about once a year. Most people went to
 the theatre in London. Harlow and then
 Cambridge were next most popular      
 places. Interest was taken in         
 comedies, musicals, thrillers and     
 Shakespeare.
