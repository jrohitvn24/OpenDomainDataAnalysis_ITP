		<title>09BOYS FASHION</title>
		<content> We asked some boys from our school if 
 they are conscious about their        
 clothes.Out of 32 boys 3 boys didn't  
 mind what they wore and the other 29  
 did.Then we asked what sort of fashion
 they like and they all said Casual.   
 Casual clothes are baggy trouses and  
 jeans, loose tops and T shirts and    
 slip on shoes.Makes of clothes are in 
 fashion too e.g Nike, Puma,Lecost and 
 Fred Perry.All makes have trade marks 
 e.g. Lecost have a little green       
 crocodile, Puma have an upside down   
 tick,Nike have a tick up the right    
 way,Fred Perry have a reef.It is not  
 only clothes that are in fashion,     
 leisure is also in the fashion such as
 B.M.X. (Bycle Motor Cross) .Groups of 
 eight boys/girls race round a         
 track.There is also Free Style which  
 is tricks.                            
                                       </content>
