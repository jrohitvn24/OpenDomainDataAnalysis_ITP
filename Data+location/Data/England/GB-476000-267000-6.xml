		<title>06Life on the farm</title>
		<content>    I am 14 years old and go to school 
 at Moulton Comprehensive.School starts
 at 8.45am and ends at 3.35pm, when I  
{walk}the mile and a half to my home at
 Moulton Lodge Farm.                   
   At weekends I get up at about 9am.If
 I'm not going shopping in Northampton,
 I watch{television.}In the afternoon,I
 read or play with my computer.If it is
 fine, I may go for a walk around the  
 farm. The rest of the weekend is spent
 watching television or doing school   
 homework. Although living on the farm 
 is quiet and tranquil, I{miss}not     
 being able to see my{friends}as much  
 as I would like. I have a long way to 
 travel for the shops and the bus fare 
 is{expensive.                         
    Although of my brothers is training
 to become a vet and the other is at   
 Agricultural College, I want to become
 a Doctor when I leave school.         </content>
