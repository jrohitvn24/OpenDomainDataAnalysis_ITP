		<title>18ENTERTAINMENT FOR YOUNGSTERS</title>
		<content> We asked a wide range of young people 
 who lived in wellingborough what they 
 did in the evenings in their spare    
 time and what they thought about the  
 town on the whole. Our results showed 
 that the majority of the interviewees 
 either played sport at the local      
 sports centre or went out for a drink 
 with their friend at a pub or club.   
 The schoolchildren who were not old   
 enough to do these things spent their 
 time walking around the town or       
 playing football in the park.         
 To conclude our interviews, we asked  
 what they thought of the town since   
 the new facilities arrived. Nearly    
 everyone thought that these were a    
 good idea, but unfortunately a small  
 minority spolit them for the rest of  
 the community.  K.Munns
