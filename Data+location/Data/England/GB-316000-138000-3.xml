		<content> At the lower end of Castle Street, the
 junction with Lime St. and St. Mary's 
 St. is called The Cross. Its name     
 derives from the old market cross     
 which used to stand in the middle of  
 the road for trading on Tuesdays. The 
 bus shelter nearby used to be the     
 village 'lockup'. When the cross was  
 demolished the old clock and bell were
 incorporated in a new clock tower now 
 standing by the bus shelter. The bell 
 used to be tolled daily at 6am by the 
 blacksmith's wife, but today it works 
 mechanically.                         
 Along Lime St. is Coleridge Cottage.  
 There are no lime trees there now, but
 when the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge 
 lived here he called his house,"This  
 Lime Tree Bower". The cottage is now  
 owned by the National Trust and is    
 open to the public. Coleridge Road    
 commemorates him.                     </content>
