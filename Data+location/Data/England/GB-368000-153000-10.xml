		<title>10NEWSPAPERS IN RADSTOCK.</title>
		<content> The Somerset Guardian is a weekly     
 publication that comes out every      
 Friday.The main story of the week gets
 to the front page.This story could be 
 printed as late as 3'oclock on        
 Thursday.There are two full time      
 reporters and news that comes from the
 public.The subeditor decides the paper
 but the editor has the final say.The  
 paper takes a week to put together.   
  The Somerset Guardian was first      
 published on January 13 1894.The paper
 is not printed in Radstock but in     
 Bath.The circulation of the paper is  
 Radstock and district, printing 10000 
 copies a week. The only financial     
 problem experienced has been with     
 advertisements.The paper needs        
 advertisements to help keep costs     
 down.If no adverts were received the  
 paper would cost Â£5 instead of 18p.
