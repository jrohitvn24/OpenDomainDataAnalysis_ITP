		<title>18CONSERVATION IN SANDHURST</title>
		<content>SEVERAL SMALL CONSERVATION AREAS       
 At Bengrove Farm  near Sandhurst there
are some Decoy Pools (GR 834226) which 
were originally built by monks as a    
fish larder. They have been left in an 
untouched state to form a home for wild
life. Badgers, foxes and pheasant are  
among the inhabitants.                 
 On Singleton Farm there are four brick
pits near the river (GR 817232). They  
were once used as withy beds for basket
making. One of them is now protected by
the Conservation Trust as a bird sanct-
uary. Swans and other water fowl are to
be found living in these ponds.        
 High Redding Hill on the opposite bank
of the river to Sandhurst is a steep-  
sided ridge where natural meadow       
grasses and plants are allowed to grow 
without grazing or ploughing.          
 In each case farmers and conservation-
ists cooperate to preserve wildlife.   </content>
