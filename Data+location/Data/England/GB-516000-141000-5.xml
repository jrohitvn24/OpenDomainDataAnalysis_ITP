		<title>05NEWDIGATE CHORAL SOCIETY</title>
		<content> Choral singing emerged as a popular   
 social activity in Newdigate early    
 this century.This popularity was      
 unboubtedly linked with the Dorking   
 centred Leith Hill Musical Festival   
 inaugurated in 1905.                  
   Beare Green and Newdigate Choral    
 Society has taken part in every Leith 
 Hill Festival since 1937.This         
 year,1985,the Choral Society once     
 again achieved the highest aggregate  
 marks in the top division of the      
 festival.                             
   Beare Green and Newdigate Choral    
 Society's activities have broadened   
 progressively,particularly over the   
 last ten years.Links have been formed 
 with a choir in Cologne culminating in
 exchange visits and combined concerts 
 every two years,alternating between   
 Germany and England.Many lasting      
 friendships have been made.           </content>
