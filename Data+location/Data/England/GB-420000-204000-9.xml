		<content>HAPPY CIRCLE OVER SIXTIES CLUB: opened 
in 1967 with music-hall stars Gert and 
Daisy the guests of honour. 65 members 
from Filkins and other villages.  Two  
meetings a month, plus coffee evenings 
to raise funds for outings &amp; Christmas 
Dinner.  Holidays are also organised.  
EXPLORERS &amp; PATHFINDERS:  Clubs run by 
the vicar &amp; his wife for under 11s (20 
from Broadshire parishes) &amp; 11-15s (12 
from Filkins &amp; Broughton Poggs).  The  
Church Pastoral Aid Society provides   
back-up for weekly meetings and offers 
adventure holidays in UK.  The PARISH  
COUNCIL OPEN-AIR SWIMMING POOL was     
opened in 1936.  The very cold water   
comes up 95ft from a bore hole. The    
original pump is still in use, but now 
a filtration plant has made the prev-  
ious frequent renewal of water unnec-  
essary.  The Pool is surrounded by     
grassy banks -fine for family picnics! </content>
