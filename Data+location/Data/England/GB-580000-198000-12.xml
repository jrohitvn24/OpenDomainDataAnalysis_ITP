		<title>12Hawes Wood</title>
		<content>    The largest wood in the whole area 
 is{Hawes Wood.}It covers about 12     
 acres.                                
    We circled the wood and noticed    
 many varieties of wild flowers growing
 there. Wild honeysuckle and dogrose   
 added their perfume to the atmosphere.
 Other June flowers included blue      
 forget-me-not, scarlet pimpernel, red 
 campion,yellow buttercups and white   
 cow parsley, making a colourful array.
   This deciduous wood was at its most 
 beautiful with oak, field maple, hazel
 and beech trees in full leaf. Very    
 little, other than ferns and black-   
 berry bushes, is growing amongst the  
 trees.The small trees, field-maple and
 hazel, are intermingled around the    
 perimeter. The taller trees, beech and
 oak, make up the main part of the     
 wood.Many small birds and animals live
 there too, eating the nuts and fruit. </content>
