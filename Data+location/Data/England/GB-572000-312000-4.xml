 1870, occupies a small site a quarter 
 of a mile from the village. Children  
 are admitted at about 4\ years of age 
 and remain until after their 8th      
 birthday. At present there are 56     
 children in three classrooms, two of  
 which are mobile buildings, whilst the
 third is the original school. The     
 majority of children live locally with
 10 coming from Pentney in transport   
 provided by the authority due to the  
 closure of{Pentney school}in 1981.    
 There are 3 teachers including the    
 Head, with 6 ancillary staff. 12      
 children at present enjoy a cooked    
 school meal whilst the rest bring a   
 packed lunch. The aim is to formulate 
 a balanced, lively, appropriate       
 curriculum laying a wholesome         
 foundation for future development.
