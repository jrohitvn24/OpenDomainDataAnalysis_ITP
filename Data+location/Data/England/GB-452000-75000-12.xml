		<content> It is part of{British Telecom.}The job
 involves speaking to the smallest of  
 yachts through to oil drilling        
 platforms, passenger liners and       
 sometimes aircraft. The most important
 part of the service is{to listen for  
{ships in distress}and to pass the     
 details on to the Coastguard.         
 Information is received from ships    
 about Navigational Buoys missing or   
 unlit.This is passed on to Trinity    
 House at East Cowes. A lot of messages
 are still passed using{morse code}but 
 most of the work now is the connecting
 of telephone calls between ships at   
 sea and ordinary telephone subscribers
 ashore.Navigational &amp; Gale Warnings   
 and Weather Forecasts are broadcast   
 using ordinary speech, morse code and 
 the latest method called{Navtex,}which
 prints the message text automatically 
 on a special machine on board ship.   </content>
