		<content> There are three hospitals in the      
 area.The Wilson Hospital is the       
 smallest one .It was opened in 1928   
 and deals mainly with orthopaedic     
 comlpaints.                           
 The Wandle Valley Hospital was opened 
 in 1899 as an isolation hospital.It   
 was sited in the Wandle Valley because
 residents of Carshalton objected to   
 those suffering from contageous       
 diseases being near to the village.It 
 is primarily a psychiatric and        
 geriatric hospital today.             
 St.Helier, the largest hospital in the
 area, is also part of the Merton,     
 Sutton and Wandsworth Area Health     
 Authority, as are the other hospitals.
 When it was built in 1938/9 it was one
 of the most modern in the world. It is
 now in the process of being modernised
 and a revamped Maternity Unit will be 
 opened in December 1985.              </content>
