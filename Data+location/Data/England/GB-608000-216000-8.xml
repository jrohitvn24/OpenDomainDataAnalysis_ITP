		<content> The majority of industrial enterprises
 in Brightlingsea are fairly small     
 concerns, employing less than forty   
 people. Nevertheless they appear at   
 present to be flourishing.            
                                       
 By far the largest single employer is 
 Astralux Dynamics, a firm specialising
 in the production of electronic and   
 mechanical components for the         
 telecommunications industry.          
                                       
{Boatbuilding and Shipbuilding}have    
 both been in decline over recent      
 years. Some ten years ago a large     
 proportion of men working in the town 
 would have been involved in some way  
 with these industries, either directly
 or through the servicing or supplying 
 of spars, sails or other fittings     
 .Today there are probably less than   
 two hundred.                          </content>
