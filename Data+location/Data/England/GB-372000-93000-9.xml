		<title>09SCHOOL,PAST AND PRESENT.</title>
		<content>   We interviewed a man who has taught 
 in Puddletown for 32 years.Many things
 have changed in that time.            
   School was far more formal in the   
 past where children would stand to    
 answer a question.Fewer facilities    
 meant that work was covered in greater
 depth.More subjects are offered in    
 today's school.                       
   The influence of the Church was     
 greater in the past.Each child was    
 expected to learn the catechism by    
 heart and the school attended church  
 at festival time.Today,the influence  
 of the Church is less obvious.        
   In the modern school children have  
 more freedom and often work in groups 
 rather than as individuals.This was   
 preferred by the interviewee.The      
 present first school used to be an all
 age 5 to 15 school.Now we have a first
 and a middle school.                  </content>
