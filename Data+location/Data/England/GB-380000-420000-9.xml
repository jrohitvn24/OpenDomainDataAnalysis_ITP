		<title>09FARMING IN ROSSENDALE</title>
		<content>   Many of the farms around the Cowpe  
 area have good{grazing land}pretty    
 high in the hills.As the going is     
 quite tough the industry is mainly    
{sheep}and cattle farming.Although     
 the cows are kept in during the winter
 and fed on good sweet hay which is    
 from the summer before ,they are put  
 out to grass during April and May.    
 On some of the{farms}there are more   
 than two hundred sheep ,as many of    
 them are kept on the tops and fed once
 a day.Near winter the sheep and       
 lambs are dipped in winter dip which  
 waterproofs them against rain,if      
 they are already wet the dip runs off 
 them .So they must be dry before they 
 are dipped.In rough weather the farmer
 tends to keep the sheep nearer the    
 farmhouse.Also two times a year,      
 winter and summer, the sheep and      
 lambs walk into a foot bath.          </content>
