 Our block is a mainly residential     
 suburb of Manchester and Stockport.It 
 contains large shopping centres and   
 good leisure and sports facilities.   
 Manchester has both a university and  
 polytechnic so the area has lots of   
 teachers, lecturers and students.     
 Communications within the block are   
 excellent , with most main  roads     
 leading into the centres of the       
 towns.There is also a motorway on the 
 edge of the area.There are industrial 
 estates especially in the Stockport   
 suburb.There are both private         
 dwellings and council housing.
