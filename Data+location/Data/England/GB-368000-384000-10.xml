		<content>  Lower the prices of turkeys and flood
 the country with cheap foreign        
 imports.                              
  Food surpluses were created and      
 milk quotas were set up.This led      
 farmers to cut back on production of  
 crops and so farmers are making less  
 profit.                               
  Nearly 1/3 of the farms in the area  
 have beef cattle,another 1/4 have     
 dairy cattle.Other livestock includes 
 calves,turkeys,heifers,horses and     
 pigs.                                 
  Of all the livestock owned by local  
 farmers pigs predominate accounting   
 for 35.5% of the total livestock.All  
 these pigs are located on 1 farm.Beef 
 cattle account for 26.2%,dairy cattle 
 22.3%,young stock 15% of the total    
 livestock.5.6% of land is used for    
 dairy stock 16.7% for grazing,27.8%   
 for grass,5.6% for fodder beet.       </content>
