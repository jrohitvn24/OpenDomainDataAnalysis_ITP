		<title>18THE PIG FARM</title>
		<content> The pig farm is behind the cheese     
 dairy. The owner of the pig farm is   
 Mr. Newell. The number of pigs and    
 piglets altogether is about 450. The  
 piglets are put into different huts as
 they grow older. When the pigs are old
 enough they go into the fattening shed
 to be fattened up for selling. They   
 are sold at 5 months. Before you go   
 into the fattening shed or the age    
 huts field, you have to put your boots
 or shoes in liquid so that you don't  
 spread diseases. Pigs catch diseases  
 very quickly and then the pigs might  
 die. The pigs eat the whey from       
 the cheese dairy and they mix that    
 with cereal mix. That is why the      
 pig farm is at the back of the cheese 
 dairy so the whey is near to the pigs.
 The pigs are weaned at three weeks.
