		<title>19Life styles</title>
		<content>  Most of the families around here live
 a very close life style. The younger  
 children go to Paull County Primary   
 School and the older Children go to   
 South Holderness School. At week ends 
 and after school most children either 
 play around the Battery or stay in and
 watch television. There is a youth    
 club at Paull but very few people go  
 there.Most of the adults go to Paull  
 in an evening to one of the three pubs
 but there is nothing else for them to 
 do. Quite a few families have videos  
 so stay in to watch films.            
  The main hobbies are fishing and     
 shooting.Most of the children have BMX
 bikes and go to the Battery to ride   
 them.                                 
  In an evening some people go to Paull
 and walk around the streets or watch  
 the ships on the river.
