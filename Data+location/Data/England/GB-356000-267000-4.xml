 rooms and extra space in both Tenbury 
 High School and Tenbury Primary       
 School.                               
      A group of volunteers called the 
 Ace of Clubs,are showing films at the 
 weekends and the bank_ holidays.The   
 Choral and the Dramatic societies     
 use the Regal Cinema to perform       
 in.Instead of paying rent to use the  
 cinema,the various clubs hope to run  
 it instead.                           
    At the Community Centre which is at
 the back of the Regal Cinema,repairs  
 are being done to the windows and the 
 door.New windows are being put in and 
 a new door with a ramp to help        
 wheelchairs to get up the step is     
 being fitted.It will also help people 
 who can't walk very well.
