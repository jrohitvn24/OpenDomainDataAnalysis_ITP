		<title>05-All Saints Church, Chilton-</title>
		<content>  The nave dates back to the 12th.     
century.The south aisle and chancel    
were added by the 14th. century. The   
tower and porch were built in 1847, but
unfortunately the 6 bell peal has not  
been rung since 1959 due to the        
weakness of the tower.2 gargoyles were 
stolen a few years ago.One was found   
and the other was probably sold.       
  The first vicar was Philip Bassett-  
1270-1275.Nowadays the Rector of       
Harwell is responible for the services-
about 7 a month.                       
  2 wardens look after the church and  
churchyard.They attend weddings,       
burials and parish meetings.They are   
also responsible for the care of the   
hymn,prayer and psalm books,and bibles.
  The churchyard is still used for     
burials.The Brooker table-tomb is      
believed to be the oldest dated tomb   
stone in this country-1551.            </content>
