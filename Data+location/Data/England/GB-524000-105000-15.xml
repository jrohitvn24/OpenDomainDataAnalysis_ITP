		<title>15West Hove Middle School</title>
		<content>   The school was built in 1905,so the 
 roof is slated and it has a bell      
 tower.When the First World War broke  
 out the school was used as a hospital 
 which explains the open fires which   
 have been boarded off.Our school has  
 very high ceilings with the compass   
 points still painted on.We did have   
 wooden floorboards,but they were so   
 creaky that the school put carpet     
 down.We have 11 classrooms with 289   
 children &amp; 14 teachers.We have sash   
 windows with the original wooden      
 frames which are high up.             
  Our practical lessons are Cookery,   
 Science,Woodwork &amp; Craft.With the     
 school fund we have bought two BBC    
 computers .Our playgrounds have been  
 tarmacked &amp; game markings (football,  
 netball,basketball &amp; hopscotch)have   
 been painted on it.We have grassbanks 
 where we used to grow vegetables.     </content>
