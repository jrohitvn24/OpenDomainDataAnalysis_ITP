		<title>16THE TOR, HELMSHORE.</title>
		<content> The Tor is one of Helmshore's main    
 attractions. A lot of people go up    
 there every week.                     
                                       
 Every year there is a race. It is     
 called the{Tor Mile Race,}and it is   
 held on the twenty-fifth of June.     
                                       
 The Tor moves and gets taller by      
 an inch a year, because of gradual    
 land movement. The top of the Tor is a
 plateau, from which you get an        
 excellent view of the whole district. 
                                       
 There are a few farms on the Tor, one 
 of which is experimental. Rough       
 grazing pasture on the slopes of the  
 Tor is used for sheep farming. As     
 there is no tree cover, the slopes are
 exposed to cold winds.
