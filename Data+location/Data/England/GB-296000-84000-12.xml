		<title>12Population of Exton.</title>
		<content>The social mix of Exton is influenced  
by two factors (1)The accessibility of 
the city of Exeter by road and rail    
since 1861.(2)The rural character of   
the surrounds.Exton has become an      
affluent village with the majority of  
home-owners in the higher-income       
brackets.This has affected the         
age-range in the village,there being a 
predominance of the over-40's group,who
now commute to Exeter by car.Many of   
the large houses are inter-war and this
may explain why Exton has a large      
percentage of retired people.          
A second group can be distinguished,   
again mainly older people,who are      
linked to the land.This includes local 
farmers,market gardeners and farm-     
workers.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
