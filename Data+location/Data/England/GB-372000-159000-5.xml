  Green Park Railway Station was opened
 on the 5th of August 1869 and was     
 built by the midland railway company. 
  The station was busiest between the  
 wars. The hight of the season was the 
 summer holidays when special trips    
 were organised to the seaside. Many   
 different trains were seen and it was 
 a popular place for train spotting.   
  Following nationilisation the station
 became less busy, it was considered to
 be 'un-yielding'and was closed on the 
 21st of September 1953.               
  For almost 30 years the city council 
 argued about the possible uses of this
 site, some suggestions were a zoo,    
 sports centre, hotel and conference   
 centre.Meanwhile the site fell into   
 disrepair.In 1980 sainsbury's bought  
 the site and restored the station.
