		<title>19An Edlington Retired Miner.</title>
		<content>   David Heggie came to Edlington 25yrs
 ago from Scotland,"a land of beauty"  
 because of pit closures;lodged for    
 a year until the N.C.B.houses were    
 complete &amp; his family moved down.His  
 first impressions were favourable;the 
 newcomers were treated as equals.As   
 every mining village,he says,Edlington
 has genuine,self-sacrificing,community
 minded folk.He filled his new home    
 with music,had a"low-key"bet on the   
 horses,went to bingo &amp; the theatre,   
 supported Doncaster Rovers,&amp; kept his 
 interest in politics.Working down the 
 pit is like no other job,he says;you  
 are conscious but not obsessed with   
 safety;men work in often unsavoury    
 conditions;no toilets underground;    
 breathing dust.New industry did bring 
 a growth in prosperity but David feels
 that this,the mining industry &amp;       
 community spirit are sadly in decline.</content>
