		<content> There are three prisons on the island 
 and their names are Camphill, Albany  
 and Parkhurst. The smallest is        
 Camphill and the biggest is Parkhurst.
 The prisoners usually help with the   
 activities round the prison like      
 growing vegetables.                   
 At the main prison there is maximum   
 security and the risk of an escape is 
 remote because there are tv monitors  
 and barbed wire everywhere.There is a 
 hospital in the prison. The prisoners 
 play sport like football, tenniis     
 badminton, squash, running and        
 jumping. They have classes such as    
 art, soft toy making, woodwork,       
 modelling,German, Spanish, French,    
 English and computer studies. There   
 are canteen facilities and prisoners  
 can buy and cook food for themselves.
