		<title>12HISTORY OF BOYATT WOOD</title>
		<content> The history of{Boyatt Wood}can be     
 traced back to Saxon times.In the     
 Domesday Book it is mentioned as      
{'Boviete'}and was held by{Herbrand the
{Norman.}However, despite being        
 mentioned in statutes of Richard 1 and
 Henry VIII and also in the 17th. and  
 18th.centuries, it never flourished as
 a community. It never had it's own    
 church. By 1860,it contained only 16  
 houses.Indeed Arthur Drewitt in his   
 book 'Eastleigh's Yesterdays'         
 published in 1935 said that by 1860   
 Boyatt as a community was dead. In    
 1985,such a statement seems impossible
 to believe for Boyatt is now a rapidly
 developing residential and commercial 
 centre.{The Crestwood Community School
{and Centre}was built to give the local
 residents much needed recreational and
 educational facilities and is the     
 nucleus of Boyatt.                    </content>
