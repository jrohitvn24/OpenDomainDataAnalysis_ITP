 Around here most farmers have animals 
 and pasture land.Apart from grass     
 there is little arable farming.There  
 is more silage than hay made because  
 it is more economical.                
 Swaledales are the most common        
 sheep.Quite a few farmers breed mules 
 (Leicester x Swaledale sheep).A few   
 people have Jacobs and quite a lot    
 have Leicesters.In Summer there are   
 many agricultural shows for people    
 to take their best animals,poultry and
 produce to display.                   
 Sometimes there are sheepdog trials.  
 Horse riding has become very popular  
 recently and you see ponies in        
 fields.Although most farmers own their
 own farms, a few are rented.It is     
 unusual in this area for more than two
 workers to be employed, as nearly all 
 the farms are small family businesses.</content>
