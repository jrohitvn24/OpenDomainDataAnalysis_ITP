		<title>10LONGWOOD HOUSE I</title>
		<content>    Longwood House was originally the  
 home, in the eighteenth century, of   
 General Lord Carpenter. The house then
 passed into the possession of the     
 Ricketts family and thence to Admiral 
 William Carnegie (Earl of Northesk,   
 Baron Rosehill, who was third in      
 command at the battle of Trafalgar)   
 upon his marriage to one of the       
 Ricketts daughters. He altered the    
 name of the house to Rosehill, but    
 this change did not last long and the 
 house soon reverted to the name of    
 Longwood. The house remained the      
 property of the Northesk family until 
 the early twentieth century.
