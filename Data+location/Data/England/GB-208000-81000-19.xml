		<title>19THE RIVER CAMEL</title>
		<content> In the River Camel on the 1st July    
 1985 they surveyed an area of the     
 Camel 70.80 metres long.              
 THE RESULTS.                          
 SALMON FRY,27,SIZE RANGE 2.6_5.1 CM   
 SALMON PARR,70,SIZE RANGE 9.4_13.3 CM 
 TROUT FRY,28,SIZE RANGE 4.4_6.6       
 TROUT PARR,76,SIZE RANGE 9.6_27.4     
 The other species found were EEL,BROOK
 LAMPREY and some BULLHEADS.There are  
 more fish in the River Camel now than 
 there were in 1977.                   
  Camelford is here because this was   
 the lowest place where the river could
 be crossed easily.People used to      
 travel on this side of Cornwall       
 because there are many deep valleys in
 the south. They used to beach their   
 boats and carry their cargoes over    
 land to the south coast.They changed  
 their mules in Camelford.The river    
 gave water-power for at least6 mills. </content>
