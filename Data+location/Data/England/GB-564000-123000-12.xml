 a small shop where you can buy things 
 for the car and sweets. There is a    
 line across the forecourt that the

 and someone will come out of the      
 workshop and serve you.

 Washer for customers to use. It has a 
 repair workshop with a hoist where    
 cars go if they have been involved in 
 a crash and they also sell spare
