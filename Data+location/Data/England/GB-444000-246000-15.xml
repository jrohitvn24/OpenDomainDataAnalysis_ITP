		<content> PIGS                                  
 Pigs get served 2 and 1/2 times a     
year.They need someone with them whilst
they have their piglets.The pens are   
scraped out twice a day,and we take 2  
or 3 wheel barrows of pig muck out     
every day .The pigs are big and        
bristly and the piglets are silky.They 
eat nuts and whilst they are feeding   
they make a lot of noise.              
 HENS                                  
 We have 3 pens of hens.The hens are   
fed 1 bucket of food a day, and they   
drink a watering can full of water.We  
collect the eggs 3 times a day.The hens
lay their eggs in funny places:- behind
the door, in the wood pile.            
 GOATS                                 
 Goats are shy animals.They live on    
farms and eat hay.They will also eat   
lots of rubbish. Baby goats are called 
Kids.Our goats don't like the geese.   </content>
