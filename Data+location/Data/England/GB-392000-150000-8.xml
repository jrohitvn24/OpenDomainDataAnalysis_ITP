		<content> The bottom third of the 12 sq.km.block
 forms part of the Imber Ranges,an army
 live firing area.It is all            
 uncultivated except for M.o.D. tree   
 planting,programmes which are in      
 operation every year,the Wiltshire    
 County Council always being informed  
 beforehand.The ranges as a whole cover
 25000 acres and form one of the       
 largest areas of uncultivated         
 chalkland in England,possibly in      
 Europe, and as such house a wide      
 variety of flora and fauna. Surveys,  
 organised by the MOD,are made at      
 frequent intervals by voluntary teams 
 headed by experts in wild life,       
 recording their findings at the MOD   
 and also at the relevant National     
 Biological Research Centre. This is a 
 combined effort between authorised    
 civilians and the army.
