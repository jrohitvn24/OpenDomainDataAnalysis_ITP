		<title>20THE REGAL CINEMA</title>
		<content>  The cinema has always been called the
 Regal since it opened in July 1934.   
 John Welch took over in 1977. He      
 turned the stalls into shops, the cafe
 into Studio 2 and the circle into     
 Studio 1.The profits from the shops   
 help to run the cinema.The films lose 
 money.                                
  Holiday-makers use the Regal and     
 local people from all over Exmoor.The 
 next cinema is 25 miles away.         
 Audiences vary in size from zero to a 
 full house.James Bond films are the   
 most succesful especially The Spy Who 
 Loved Me.                             
  Mr Welch runs the Regal single handed
 with part-time help.He is projection- 
 -ist,ice-cream seller,cleaner,and     
 shopkeeper.He enjoys his work except  
 the cleaning.                         
  Studio 1 is also used for pantomimes 
 and plays by amateur groups.          </content>
