		<content>   Less importance has been placed on  
 Mylor as a farming area.The majority  
 of people commute into the towns as   
 Mylor boasts no major industrial jobs.
                                       
   The playing fields were opened in   
 1947 as a lease-hold from Col.Trefusis
 on the condition that he could graze  
 his cattle on the meadows.On May 13th 
 1963 a hall was built on the grounds  
 for use as a Youth Club.The Brownies  
 and Tregetreath Sailing Club were set 
 up in 1954.                           
                                       
   The Cornish Music Festival began    
 here in 1953 by Rev.F.Martin and      
 Mr.Sinfield of Perranarworthal where  
 it was staged in Tremayne Hall.When it
 out-grew Mylor it moved to Truro to   
 become the 3 Spires Festival.
