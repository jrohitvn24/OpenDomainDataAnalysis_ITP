		<title>10Attitudes In East Huntspill</title>
		<content> We asked some people what their       
 attitudes were towards East Huntspill.
 Some said it was a friendly place with
 nice small shops, and others said they
 liked the local country side. The     
 people were then asked if they thought
 that the village could be changed in  
 any way to make it better. Some said  
 it could be cleaned up because of the 
 amount of litter, and others said it  
 would spoil it if it was made to big  
 by developing housing estates. The    
 Harvest Home held in September is the 
 one village event that everybody      
 seemed to look forward to. The new    
 village playing field which was opened
 in July 1984 was the result of many   
 years fund raising in the village and 
 is regulary used by the villagers for 
 recreational purposes.
