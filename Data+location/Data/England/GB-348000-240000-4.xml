		<title>04A DAY OUT IN NEWENT</title>
		<content> I woke up at 8.00 and after watching  
 Scooby-doo and Wide Awake Club on T.V.
 I dressed. I put on trousers because  
 I was going with five friends to the  
{Falconry Centre}at{Newent.}On the way 
 Edith's dad missed the turning so we  
 had to go back. I took Â£1.00 to spend 
 on souvenirs. On arrival we went to   
 see the flying demonstration by Smith 
 and Twisted Sister, the{Tawny Eagles.}
 After our picnic, we had a guided tour
 of the aviaries. We saw{Goldie}the    
{Golden Eagle}who escaped from Regent's
 Park Zoo, now in retirement at Newent.
 Next we saw Smith and Blewitt the     
{Lanner Falcon}give a flying demon-    
 stration. After that we bought souven-
 irs at the shop. I bought a small pen,
 a keyring, a bird of prey's feather, &amp;
 a postcard of a Sparrowhawk feeding   
 her young. In the evening I swam in a 
 Gala at Ross.Tomorrow is Father's day.</content>
