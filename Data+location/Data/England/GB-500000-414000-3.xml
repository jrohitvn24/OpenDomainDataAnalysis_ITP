		<content>   My favourite game is on my{computer 
 ,it is called{Elite.Elite}is a game in
 space where you buy , sell and move   
 from Space station to Space station.  
   Sometimes you get attacked by Bounty
 Hunters and pirates.Your armament is a
 forward{Laser Cannon}and four missiles
 .In the Game there are eight different
 Galaxies with three hundred and fifty 
 planets in each.The starter planet is 
 Lave. You have seven light years of   
 fuel which you can get at any space   
 station.You start with one hundred    
 credits to buy whatever you want.     
   Another indoor game that I play is  
{Squash.}There is a lot of running     
 around and you score just a bit like  
{tennis.}The only time you can get some
 points is when you're serving.The game
 is in a room with{red lines}on the    
 wall.The red lines are{boundary lines.
