		<title>08SAINT BARBARAS CHURCH ASHTON</title>
		<content>   The state of church life at{Saint   
{Barbaras, Ashton under Hill}in 1985 is
 rather a sad one. Gone are the days of
 large congregations led by a full and 
 enthusiastic choir and of one priest  
 per parish. Instead the congregations 
 are small, mainly middle aged to      
 elderly, led in service by half a     
 dozen devoted choir members and served
 by a priest who is shared with two    
 other parishes amounting to four other
 churches.                             
   This small church community has the 
 added burden of maintaining an ancient
 building which needs thousands of     
 pounds spent on it, at a time of high 
 unemployment and world recession.     
   A bright spot at{St. Barbaras}is    
 it's lively Sunday School, which it is
 hoped, will ensure the survival of the
 church in the next decade.
