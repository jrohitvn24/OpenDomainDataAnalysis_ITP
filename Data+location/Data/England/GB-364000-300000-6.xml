		<content> The local paper for this area is the  
 Bridgnorth Journal. In the issue for  
 Friday September 27th was a report    
 that Alan Rye, a local builder, wants 
 to rebuild the{Pritchard Memorial}in  
 Broseley High Street.The original was 
 built in 1862 to commemorate George   
 Pritchard. It was demolished in the   
 mid 1940's. Mr Rye's plan has roused  
 mixed feelings in the town.           
 Pupils at the Church of England       
 Primary School were treated to a      
 display of juggling, music,and fun by 
{The Fabulous Salami Brothers}last     
 week. The Salamis popped into the     
 school before their concert at the    
 Broseley Social Club.

 asking for new members to learn first
