		<title>06HOUSE TENANCY IN BRENTWOOD</title>
		<content>   The houses within 0.5 km of the High
 Street are mostly{privately owned.}   
 The houses 1 km from the High         
 Street are on a large estate{owned by 
{the council.}This was built by a      
{London}council to accommodate an      
 overflow of people from London.       
                                       
   The{private houses}are about 50     
 years old but are well-kept.The       
{council houses}are about 40-50 years  
 old but are in a worse condition.Most 
 of the{council houses}are terraced or 
 semi-detached. The{private houses}are 
 mostly semi-detached or detached and  
 have an average of 3-4 bedrooms. They 
 are bigger overall than the{council   
{houses}which have 2-3 bedrooms,       
 smaller gardens and often have no     
 garages. This causes problems with    
 cars being parked on roadsides or on  
 pavements.                            </content>
