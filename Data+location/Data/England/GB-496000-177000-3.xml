		<content>  Like the neighbouring village of     
 Datchet ,Eton grew up on the only part
 of the land above the usual level of  
 the river Thames .Travellers from     
 Windsor Castle going to the north made
 regular use of the High Street,       
 Inns and shops grew up to cater for   
 their needs. The founding of Eton     
 College provided the village with a   
 permanent patron and customer.        
   The village has always been liable  
 to flooding and there were severe     
 floods in 1894 and 1947.The older     
 parts of the village then revealed    
 themselves as small islands standing  
 above the river.Large and decorative  
 boot-scrapers outside many of the     
 older houses testify to the muddy     
 nature of the area.
