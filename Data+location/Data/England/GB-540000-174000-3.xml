		<content>Eltham Palace.                         
Much of Eltham Palace was built by the 
Bishop of Durham around 1300.When he   
died it passed into the hands of the   
monarchy.The palace enjoyed great      
popularity during the Plantagenet      
period.In 1479 Edward 4 constructed a  
replacement for the original great hall
which had been destroyed,and a few     
years later Henry 7 built the stone    
moat-bridge which is extant today.     
However during the Tudor period it fell
into disuse except for occasional Royal
hunting trips.By the seventeenth       
centuary it was in private hands and   
had become virtually uninhabitable.It  
was used as a barn and fell into ruins 
despite repair work.In 1933 the        
Courtaul family extensively renovated  
the hall and built an extension        
adjacent to it.This is at present      
occupied by the Royal Army Educational </content>
