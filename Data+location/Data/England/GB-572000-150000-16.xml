		<title>16Palm Cottage, Well St. Loose</title>
		<content> Palm Cottage is thought to have       
 been built in 1381.  The owner now is 
 Mrs.Clarke.  In an interview that she 
 gave with Catherine Blackman of Loose 
 Junior School she said:               
   "25 years ago hardly anyone had     
 cars. Now nearly everyone has two     
 cars. It will mean difficulty with    
 parking and people pass through,      
 rather than walk through the village."
 Mrs.Clarke would walk through the     
 village with her baby 25 years ago and
 there would be several older people   
 hanging over their gates and wanting  
 to talk so that it would take all     
 afternoon to walk round the village.  
 "Now there are more young people and  
 fewer older people.  One reason is, as
 rented houses have become empty, the  
 owners have sold them."  Mrs.Clarke   
 called the village a dormitory area.
