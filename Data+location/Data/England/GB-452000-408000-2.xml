		<content> I am ten years old and my dad is a    
 miner.On March 13th my Dad went on    
 strike along with all his             
 workmates.When we got home and told us
 the news we didn't think it would last
 long.But ..Spring turned into Summer  
 and we didn't go on outings or        
 holidays at all.As Christmas          
 approached and the colder months set  
 in my mum and dad got more and more   
 unhappy because we didn't have any    
 coal to burn...At Christmas we hardly 
 got any presents and my Mum and Dad   
 had only a bottle of wine to share.In 
 January my Dad started talking about  
 going back to work...On Jan. 24th he  
 went back...all those that had the    
 courage to go back....got called scab,
 and even me and my brother..But we're 
 not bothered my Dad's got bonus money 
 for going back to work.
