		<title>01General Review of the Block</title>
		<content>   The area is situated on the southern
 border of Derbyshire. In contrast to  
 the coal &amp; clay workings which        
 traditionally provided employment to  
 the north east around the town of     
 Swadlincote, it is a rural landscape. 
 The rich loam soil is well suited to  
 the growing of cereal crops and roots.
 There is also much permanent pasture  
 for beef and dairy cattle.            
   The village of Lullington in the    
 south-west corner of the block        
 provides the main focus of settlement.
 Smaller concentrations of population  
 are found in Liverpool and Clifton    
 Row. There are also several isolated  
 farmhouses and farm workers cottages. 
   The farming influence is very strong
 within the community. Most of the     
 inhabitants have some association with
 agriculture and as a result the area  
 retains a rustic character.           </content>
