		<content>      Watch and Chain, Watch and Chain?
      Who has stole my Watch and Chain?
      My fair lady. "                  
 The children are marching through an  
 arch made by two children holding     
 hands. On the word "lady" the arch    
 traps a child and everyone sings:     
     "Off to prison you must go,       
       you must go, you must go.       
      Off to prison you must go,       
      My fair lady"                    
 The child who is caught chooses to be 
 a watch or a chain and stands behind  
 the arch person who is a watch or a   
 chain. When everyone has been caught  
 there is a tug o' war.                
                                       
 Some games have interesting names like
{Wall-ee, Short Line, Long Line,       
{Offground Tig, 1-2-3 &amp; in, World Cup, 
{Hopscotch, Kit-Kat }and we also play  
 fighting games like {Romans &amp; Saxons. </content>
