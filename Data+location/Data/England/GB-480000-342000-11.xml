		<content>{Attitudes:}Most of the older people   
 feel that the village is much more    
 outward looking than it was. More     
 weekly shopping is done in nearby     
 towns{(Grantham and Newark)}but the   
 village shops are still used for      
 essential items. From a{questionnaire 
 which was distributed, we found that a
 lot of people wanted better street    
 lighting, but something has already   
 been done about this. Also people     
 wanted a central playing field and a  
 gas main. It was felt that the        
 condition of the footpaths could be   
 improved and the speed limit on some  
 roads lowered. The local residents    
 feel the character of the village     
 hasn't changed too much and it has    
 still kept it's rural atmosphere. It  
 is still a very pleasant place in     
 which to live.
