		<content> My real day starts at 8.30am when the 
 school bus collects the children to go
 to{Todwick School}and my husband      
 leaves for work. I have until 3.45pm  
 to myself when the children are       
 delivered home. Living in a small     
 village it is easy to feel lonely and 
 remote, your own effort determines the
 day. I usually do my housework as     
 quickly as possible and check that my 
 elderly widower neighbour is all      
 right. I shop twice a week by car in  
 Worksop or{Sheffield.}A butcher,baker 
 and greengrocer come regularly. The   
 Sub Post-Office has just closed so we 
 have to go to the next village for    
 pensions, family allowance or even a  
 stamp.The main social events are      
 meeting village friends for tea or    
 coffee, but the children have to go   
 outside the village for{Brownies}or   
 Cubs or{Swimming.}A car is essential. </content>
