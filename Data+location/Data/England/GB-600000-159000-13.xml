		<title>13  THE PARISH CHURCH</title>
		<content>    The parish church,dedicated to St  
Mary of Charity is one of the landmarks
which makes Faversham a historic town. 
Outstanding features include an        
impressive spire,a painted pillar(dated
to 1304) and carved misericords.       
    However the church is in need of   
repairs, estimated at 405,000 pounds.  
Much of the damage is attrubuted to    
19th century "improvements" which      
included covering the exterior with    
flint and Bath stone(since found       
unsuitable in the South East climate)  
and lead sheeting on the roof.         
    An appeal chaired by The Lord      
Boston of Faversham Q.C. to raise most 
of this money has led to a large       
dispute in the town over the ownership 
of four silver flagons(see page 14).
