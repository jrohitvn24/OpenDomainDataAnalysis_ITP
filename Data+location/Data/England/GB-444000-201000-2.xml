		<title>02Cereal Farming - Henwood</title>
		<content>      Henwood farm, owned  by All Souls
 College,  consists of 328 acres, under
 grain,  apart from a patch of woodland
 and a rough pasture paddock.  The main
 crops are wheat and barley,  but a new
 cereal,{triticale, }is being grown for
 the  first  time this year on the very
 dry  coarse  sandy  soil at the top of
 the escarpment.  Triticale is produced
 by crossing wheat,barley and ryegrass.
 It will be sold for cattle fodder.    
      Different  varieties of wheat are
 grown,    suitable  for  wheat  flour,
 pastry making or for pasta.  All grain
 is sold to brokers when the prices are
 favourable, forward selling in January
 has already accounted for much of this
 season's harvest.  Grain must be clean
 and free from weed seeds.             
      The farmer and his wife fertilise
 and harvest the crops,but a contractor
 is employed to plough the fields.     </content>
