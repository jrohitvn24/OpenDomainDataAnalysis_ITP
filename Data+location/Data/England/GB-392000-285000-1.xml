		<content> There are three types of houses in the
 area we chose for our survey.These    
 are{council}(40%),{newly built houses}
  (24%) and{old pre-war houses }(36%). 
  Gone are the days when an inside     
 toilet was considered a modern        
 convenience.Today (52%) have {central 
{heating},(95%) have{washing machines},
  (79%) have{telephones}and (56%) have 
{videos.}                              
  Most houses have three bedrooms,a    
 lounge,a dining room,a bathroom,a     
 kitchen,a hall and a loft. Each room  
 is carpeted and the walls are normally
 covered with wallpaper.Most rooms are 
 extensively furnished which as well as
 being attractive is also comfortable.
