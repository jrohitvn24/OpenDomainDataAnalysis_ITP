		<title>07The River Tern</title>
		<content> The Tern flows West along the Southern
 edge of the area.Its steep sided      
 valley,a major feature of the area,has
 proved to be a natural barrier to the 
 development of the town.Routes up from
 the valley are steep, notably Kiln    
 Bank and Red Bank .Phoenix Bank,      
 carrying the A529 after it has crossed
 the Tern, is the major route.There are
 two other bridging points, the Sutton 
 Road crosses it at Walkmill and       
 Buntingsdale Road crosses it in the   
 West. The Tern has also been useful.It
 has powered two mills in the area.    
 Neither of these operate today.The    
 mill at Walkmill is only a derelict   
 site.The house and mill at Tern house 
 adjacent to the A529 still stand but  
 the machinery is long gone. The open  
 swimming pool is heated by the Tern   
 using heat exchange equipment.The     
 sewage farm discharges into the river.</content>
