		<title>05THE GAMES WE PLAY</title>
		<content>   We play a lot of games in the school
 yard and at home.  One of the games we
 play is "Dicky".  When my dad was     
 little they called it "Dicky Leavo".  
 To play Dicky you need two equal      
 teams.  There is a base in a corner or
 against a wall.  One team runs while  
 the other team counts to ten.  When   
 they have counted they chase after the
 other team and try to catch them.     
 Those caught are taken to the base.   
 The other people who are not caught   
 can go and "tig" the base and say     
 "Dicky".  The people in the base are  
 then free.  When you have caught the  
 people you have to say "Dicky - 1,2,3,
 4,5,6,7,8,9,10", and take them back to
 the base.  When all the team are      
 caught, it is the other team's turn to
 run.                                  
                                       
                                       </content>
