		<title>09MILVERTON'S TWIN TOWN</title>
		<content>      I INTERVIEWED NICHOLAS HOYLE FROM
 CLASS 3 ABOUT HIS TRIP TO FRANCE. HE  
 WENT WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE FROM        
 MILVERTON TO A PLACE CALLED LONGNY    
 AU PERCHE BECAUSE THAT IS MILVERTON'S 
 TWIN TOWN. NICHOLAS SAID THAT HE      
 DID NOT GET SEA SICK. WHEN HE GOT TO  
 FRANCE IT WAS VERY BUSY, NOT AT ALL   
 LIKE MILVERTON. IT WAS VERY STRANGE   
 THAT THERE WERE NO TREES IN THE TOWN  
 BUT A LOT OF TREES OUTSIDE IT. LONGNY 
 AU PERCHE IS ABOUT THE SAME SIZE AS   
 MILVERTON AND ALSO IT HAS ABOUT THE   
 SAME NUMBER OF SHOPS.                 
                                       
      THE FOOD THAT NICHOLAS LIKED MOST
 WAS TRIPE AND ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS 
 OF FISH THAT THEY HAD. HE STAYED WITH 
 A FRENCH FAMILY AND SAYS THAT THEY    
 WERE VERY NICE AND KIND. EVERYBODY    
 ENJOYED THE TRIP VERY MUCH.
