		<content> The area as a whole is sparsely       
 populated, the population being       
 employed either locally; the farms    
 employing mostly their own family     
 units, or in the nearby towns.        
                                       
 Many of the farms and barns have been 
 converted to homes for businessmen and
 their families who commute. The vast  
 majority of people in the area own    
 their own transport.                  
                                       
 There are no shops so a butcher's van,
 a travelling fish salesman and several
 gocers' vans cover the area; the bulk 
 of food shoping is carried out in the 
 nearby towns.                         
                                       
 The area is on the edge of the Ribble 
 Valley which is currently being       
 promoted as a tourist area.
