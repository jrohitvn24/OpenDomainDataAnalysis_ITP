		<title>02St Peter's Church.</title>
		<content>     St Peter's Church was built in the
 13th century, and stands at the centre
 of the old village.It is built of     
 sandstone, and recently much          
 restoration work has been carried out 
 with the help of the Y.T.S. St Peter's
 Church is a focal point in Barnburgh, 
 and brings many visitors into the     
 village eager to learn of the famous  
 Cat and Man legend associated with    
 it.The church has been responsible for
 introducing many and varied activities
 for the two villages. One only has to 
 glance at the Church Magazine to      
 realise just how busy, people,both    
 young and old are.                    
    At the side of the Church stands   
 the Parochial Hall which was built in 
 1912, and where many different        
 associations meet. E.g.  Scouts - Cubs
 Guides - Brownies - Mothers' Union -  
 Fellowship and Bible Study  - W.I.    </content>
