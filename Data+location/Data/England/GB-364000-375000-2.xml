		<title>02PLAYGROUND GAMES.</title>
		<content> These are some of the games played on 
 our playground: Chocolate, Tick, Polo,
 Scarecrow Tick, Elastics, British     
 Bulldog, Captain's Coming, Marbles,   
 Skipping and Hopscotch. This is how   
 to play{Captain's Coming:}The girl on 
 can shout 'Port' or 'Starboard' and   
 you have to run to a corner.If she    
 shouts "Swing the Boom", you have to  
 bob down. "Scrub the Deck" and "Climb 
 the Rigging" mean you have to pretend 
 to do these things. If you are the    
 last to do these actions, you are on. 
{Chocolate}is played like this:The girl
 "on" stands about 10 metres away. The 
 others have to creep up on her, but   
 she can turn round suddenly. If she   
 sees you, you have to freeze with your
 arm out. If someone can tick you they 
 say'Chocolate' and you can go back. If
 you are ticked before you reach the   
 children, then you are "on".          </content>
