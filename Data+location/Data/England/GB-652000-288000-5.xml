		<title>05HOLIDAY CAMP (continued)</title>
		<content>  The string of holiday camps along the
coast reflects the {history} of        
{holidays} over the last 50            
years. Originally they were of easy    
access to working families from        
London.  The railway ran special       
Saturday afternoon trains from         
Liverpool Street station which allowed 
Saturday morning workers to start      
their holiday straight after work. The 
trains called at all stations up the   
coast to North Norfolk.                
 The changing fortunes of the Camps    
have been linked to changes in         
holidays and {travel}. Nowadays,       
most people arrive by coach or by car. 
Pontin's original idea was that a      
holiday should cost not more than one  
week's wages and prices per person are 
still in the same ratio.
