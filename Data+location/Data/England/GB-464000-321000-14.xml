		<title>14Village Hall.</title>
		<content> The Village Hall,which had been the   
 old village school,was re-opened on   
 the 18th.May 1985.It has been         
 re-roofed,re-decorated,a new heating  
 system,new toilets and a new floor put
 in.                                   
 In 1982 the Hall needed repairing so  
 the Old Dalby Community Association   
 (O.D.C.A.)was formed.O.D.C.A. had     
 three choices about where to have a   
 new hall.Finally they chose to buy the
 old Village Hall.They got money from  
 the Rural County Council,Melton       
 Borough Council,the Parish Council and
 raised a quarter of the cost (Â£5,000) 
 themselves.They raised the money by   
 holding fairs,dances,concerts,raffles,
 sponsored walks,a marathon,coffee     
 mornings and money given by the Old   
 Dalby Quilters.The Hall should become 
 the centre for all village activities.
