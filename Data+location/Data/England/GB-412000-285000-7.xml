		<content>On Saturday I got up at 7.30.At 8.30 I 
was picked up by the milkman I work for
I delivered the milk round the flats   
and tidied up the float.At 9.55 I went 
to the cafe for sausage and tomato     
sandwich and a cup of tea.I then went  
back to work until 2.10.I went home,had
a bath and got changed and caught the  
bus to Erdington to meet my friend at  
the Social Services centre.He was there
doing community service.On this        
particular day he was helping put a    
fire extinguisher in a car which was   
then towed to Birmingham Wheels race   
track for a banger race that evening.We
got there at 6.30,had a jumbo hot dog  
[my first real meal of the day]and     
watched some races.Our driver had a    
bump in his first race but came fourth 
in his second.Afterwards we took the   
car back and I got a lift home,getting 
in at 11.00 and going to bed.          </content>
