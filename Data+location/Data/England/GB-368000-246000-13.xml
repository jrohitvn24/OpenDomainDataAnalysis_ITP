		<title>13Mixed Farming:Hillside Farm</title>
		<content>   Mr. and Mrs. Oliver live at Hillside
 Farm.  The 300 acre farm is divided   
 into 50 fields for arable.  They have 
 130 Hereford cross{cattle}for beef and
 400{ewes.}                            
   He has approximately 5 tractors, 3  
 ploughs, 3 rollers and 1 power harrow,
 and 2 labourers (his son, his wife and
 1 employed man help run the farm).    
   The farm produces 100 tons of{wheat}
 per year and the livestock are sold at
 Hereford, Kidderminster and           
 Gloucester.  The livestock provide    
 manure for fertilising the arable     
 fields which protects the structure of
 the soil.  The cattle in winter feed  
 on silage, barley and oats, while in  
 summer they go on the meadows.        
   This farm is not typical of the area
 as most are dairy farms.              
   The farm house is georgian.
