 In the {Hundred Rolls,}and {Ancient   
{Woodlands}it is stated that the people
 living around the forest exercised the
    following {Woodland Rights}:       
 1. Removal of dead timber             
                                       
 2. Grazing of animals                 
 The latter was still taking place in {
{1792 .}Cattle, horses,sheep,and pigs  
 at specified times, and within certain
 boundaries were allowed into the      
 Forest from Finstock, Leafield,       
 Ramsden.                              
{Palm Sunday} saw Leafield villagers   
 going to {Wort's Well }to collect     
 water in bottles containing Spanish   
 Wood and peppermint. This was used as 
 a remedy for winter ailments.         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
