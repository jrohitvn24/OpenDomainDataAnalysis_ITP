		<title>01General Overview of the Area</title>
		<content> The land in this block is{largely}    
{agricultural}but includes sections of 
 residential areas from three towns -  
{Castleford,Pontefract and Knottingley.
 The area is dominated by{Ferrybridge  
{Power Station}which can be seen from  
 all corners of the block as well as   
 much further afield.The{M.62}runs from
 east to west through the block.{Mining
 is probably the biggest single source 
 of employment and the effects of the  
{miners strike (1984-85)}were felt     
 throughout the area.Unemployment is   
 slightly higher than the national     
 average (about 14%).Very few people   
 are employed in agriculture.The people
 involved in compiling the information 
 normally have very little contact with
 each other.Airedale people regard     
 Castleford as their main centre while 
 Ferrybridge people look to Pontefract 
 and Knottingley.                      </content>
