		<title>08Mills In Sheerness</title>
		<content>        There were 3 flour{mills}in    
 Sheerness until 1862 when one of them 
 caught fire and was ruined. As it was 
 built of wood, with a tarred roof it  
 was completely destroyed. The mill had
 been built in 1810 behind the Free-   
 masons Hall in Sheerness High Street. 
        The second mill, known as the  
 Great Mill stood in the High Street   
 and was operated by {steam}until 1918 
 and was then pulled down in 1924.     
        A third mill , called the      
 Hundred Acre Mill, the base of which  
 can still be seen in the yard of the  
 Seaview Hotel in the Broadway, worked 
 until 1878. The opening of{the rail-  
{way}caused the closure of the mills   
 and the loss of this{industry}as they 
 were eventually pulled down.
