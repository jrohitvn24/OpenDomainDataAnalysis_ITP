		<title>04The Cockhall "Digs".</title>
		<content>  An enormous tree was blown over on   
 the Eglingham estate near{Cockhall}two
 years ago. Some{ancient pots}were     
 found and it was discovered that it   
 had been a{burial mound}four thousand 
 years ago. An archiologst took us to  
 see the site and showed us the pots   
 and flints that had been found. The   
 pots had been in pieces and had been  
 stuck together. They had patterns on  
 them but some bits were missing. The  
 dig was on a hill top and a grave had 
 been made to show what it would have  
 looked like originally. They often    
{buried pots, flints and necklaces}with
 their dead but the archiologists had  
 not been able to find any beads, nor  
 any bones here. We have visited       
 another site just outside this        
 project's area where four graves,     
 necklaces, pots and arrow-heads have  
 been discovered.                      </content>
