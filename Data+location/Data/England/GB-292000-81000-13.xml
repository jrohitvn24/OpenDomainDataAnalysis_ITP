  It was built as a sawmill in the 17th
 century. In the time of water power.  
 The lady who's in charge of the mill  
 has lived and worked at the sawmill   
 for 7 years. They get their wood      
 mainly from plantations on Haldon     
 Woods near Exeter and other private   
 farms. The main types of woods are    
 (hard) oak, chestnut (soft woods)     
 birch and douglas. They send the      
 products locally and to the south of  
 England. They have not had any        
 accidents yet. Eight men work at the  
 sawmill and there are four saws,two   
 pullover saws and two break down. They
 use ten cubic metres of wood per day.
