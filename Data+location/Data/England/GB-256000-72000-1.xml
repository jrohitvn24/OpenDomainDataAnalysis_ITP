		<title>01The Village of Princetown</title>
		<content> Princetown village well-known for its 
 prison, lies 7 miles E of Tavistock on
 the B3357 and 6 miles NE of Yelverton,
 at 1,400 feet above sea level.        
                                       
   Its situation in the southern area  
 of the Dartmoor National Park appeals 
 to people from all walks of life, who 
 visit it either by car or coach or as 
 part of a walking or camping holiday. 
  From the village there are many      
 interesting and varied walks, taking  
 in Hut Circles and Standing Stones of 
 Bronze Age origin, old tin mine       
 workings, quarries and spectacular    
 views for miles of unspoilt moorland. 
  Within the village there are shops,  
 cafes and all the usual amenities plus
 a camping site, a Residential Youth   
 Centre (booking in advance) and a     
 National Park Information Centre.
