		<content> This area is entirely rural. It       
 consists of gently rolling farmland,  
 largely grassland. There are a fair   
 number of hedges and trees, but no    
 woods. Although the area is close to  
 the city of Leicester, it recieves few
 visitors, as it is not of outstanding 
 beauty.                               
                                       
 There are two villages, Peatling Magna
 (Peatling), and Willoughby Waterleys  
 (Willoughby). They have few           
 facilities, apart from a church and a 
 pub each.                             
                                       
 Each village has a mixture of         
 inhabitants; farmers and farm workers,
 retired people, workers who commute to
 Leicester, and fairly wealthy people  
 who live in the large houses in the   
 villages.                             
                                       </content>
