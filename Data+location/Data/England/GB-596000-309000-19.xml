		<title>19A PUPIL'S DAY IN TOFTWOOD</title>

  I got changed and watched television 
 until 5.15p.m. when I did the         
 washing-up. At 5.30 I ate dinner in   
 the lounge with my Mum and sister, my 
 Dad is often late as he works for a   
 washing machine company in Norwich. We
 had sausages, beans and chips. At 6.00
 p.m. I went upstairs to listen to my  
 radio while my suster did the         
 washing-up. At 6.45 p.m I went out to 
 hand-bell ringing with my friend. I   
 did not play until 7.30p.m. as they   
 were practising a tune which I was not
 needed for, but by 8.00p.m we were on 
 our way home. I watched television    
 until 9.00 p.m. when I made coffee and
 got ready for bed, I stayed watching  
 television until 10.00 p.m. and by    
 10.15 p.m. I was in bed.
