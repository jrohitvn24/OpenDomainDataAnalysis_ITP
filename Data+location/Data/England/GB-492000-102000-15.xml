		<content>   88% of the block is farmland in     
 which 68% is wheat,barley and         
 oats.There are potatoes,peas and beans
 grown as well.Once the fields used to 
 be small with hedges around them to   
 stop soil erosion,but nowadays the    
 fields are big and flat,so that the   
 farmer gets the most out of the       
 land.Fertilizer is put on more and    
 spraying is also done in a big        
 way.Most of the farms put the grain   
 into Silos and sell it during the     
 summer and winter to bigger storage   
 places,such as in Tangmere.The wheat  
 is then sold to bakeries,chicken      
 farmers to feed the chickens or sent  
 to foreign countries.
