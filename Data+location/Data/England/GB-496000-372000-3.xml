		<title>03WEST COMMON</title>
		<content> The West Common is a large area of    
 grass and trees which measures 3.5    
 miles round the edge.  It is open for 
 anyone to go on. There is a football  
 pitch, rugby pitch, bowling green and 
 tennis court.  It slopes at the end so
 it is popular for sledging in the     
 winter.  There is a small pond called 
 the Ornamental pond which has fish in.
 Sometimes there are point-to-point    
 races with horses.  Usually there are 
 horses standing on the common.  Down  
 one side there is a small lane with   
 trees on called Aldermans Walk, there 
 are houses too.  There are small      
 places fenced in with small trees that
 have just been planted.  If you stand 
 at the bottom of the common you get a 
 good view of the City and if you stand
 at the top you get a very good view of
 the countryside.
