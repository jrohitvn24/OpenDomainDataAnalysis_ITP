		<title>14LIFE STYLES IN M.W./SHIPT.</title>
		<content> The older generation in the area are  
 very conservative in their life       
 styles. The area is predominantly     
 rural and is regarded as a safe       
 conservative seat.  The M.P., Sir Paul
 Bryant, has a large majority.  The    
 main form of recreation in the area   
 would be a night out at the pub or    
 social club for these people.  some   
 couples dine out, but they tend to go 
 out of the area.                      
 There is very little night life       
 activity for young people.  Motor     
 bikes are popular, as is the dress    
 which accompanies it.  Teenage girls  
 wear make-up, but few boys do.  In    
 dress sense, anything goes among      
 youngsters.
