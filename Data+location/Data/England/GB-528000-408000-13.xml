		<content>  Each year up to one million people   
 visit Cleethorpes. Most come just for 
 the day by coach, train or car. Many  
 people come from {Yorkshire }and{     
{Nottinghamshire}but they also come    
 from much farther away such as        
 Liverpool.For people staying, there   
 are {33 guest houses }and{26 hotels.} 
    What attracts the tourists most is 
 the beach but also,free entertainment,
 leisure and watersports. People from  
 abroad, particularly{Nigeria,}also    
 enquire  about {Cleethorpes .         
   To attract people to {Cleethorpes,} 
 they put advertisements in national   
 newspapers and the Tourist Board      
 publications. The{Leisure Centre}is   
 the facility that attracts the most   
 visitors. We found out that most      
 people would like the pier to be      
 reopened, also more seats and litter  
 bins are needed.                      </content>
