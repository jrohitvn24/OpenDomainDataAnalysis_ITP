		<content> The area has residents from many      
 countries and they have many different
 faiths. The two parish churches, All  
 Saints in Monk Sherborne and St.      
 Andrews at Sherborne St. John are     
 Anglican. In Sherborne St. John there 
 is a Brethren Chapel/Meeting Room.    
 Many Roman Catholics in the area      
 worship at St. Gabriels, a chapel     
 within St. Bedes Roman Catholic       
 Primary School.  There are services   
 held for different denominations at   
 the two chapels within the Basingstoke
 District Hospital complex. Other      
 faiths, which include Jews, Buddhists 
 and Hindus, have to travel outside the
 area to their place of worship.
