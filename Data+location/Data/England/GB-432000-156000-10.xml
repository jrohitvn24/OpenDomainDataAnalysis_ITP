 The Reverend Ian Gardner is the Vicar 
 of 4 parishes, Vernham  Dean.         
 Faccombe, Linkenholt and Hurstbourne  
 Tarrent. His Vicarage is in           
 Hurstbourne Tarrent so there is no    
 resident clergyman in Vernham Dean.   
 Services are held every Sunday in our 
 church but not always by the vicar.   
 Sometimes a lay member of the church  
 takes a service but only an ordained  
 priest can take Holy communion. The   
 Vicar is also a govenor of the        
 school,as it is a church school. He   
 takes all services of baptism,        
 marriages and funerals.               
   The Church of St. Mary at Vernham   
 Dean has a Norman Porch also part     
 of the North wall but was extensively 
 altered in the nineteenth century.
