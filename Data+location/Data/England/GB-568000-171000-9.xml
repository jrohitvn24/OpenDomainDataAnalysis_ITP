		<title>09  FILBOROUGH FARM</title>
		<content> Filborough farm is situated near to   
 Shorne marshes. It covers 60 acres of 
 land and is used mostly for corn,     
 wheat and vegetables. Mr Merritt, the 
 farmer, does not own the farm but     
 rents it from the Kent County Council.
 He does not employ any workers on the 
 farm, but uses contractors to do a lot
 of the work at certain times of the   
 year. There are also 8 long           
 greenhouses on the farm for growing   
 lettuces, tomatoes and peppers.       
 The corn that he produces is sold to  
 corn merchants to make malt beer or to
 dairy farmers as livestock feed. The  
 wheat is sold to mills for bread      
 making. The vegetables are mainly sold
 locally but many are also taken to    
 market in London and often end up in  
 supermarkets. Mr Merritt said that    
 1985 has been a good growing year.
