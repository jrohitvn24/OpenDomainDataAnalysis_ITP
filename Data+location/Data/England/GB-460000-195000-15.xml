		<title>15The Lamb Cricket Club</title>
		<content> The pitch is behind the public house, 
it is small but has a very good wicket.
 Also it has a very good outfield.But  
there is one problem,the ball sometimes
goes in the brook which goes round the 
on-side of the pitch.There is also a   
field on the off-side.                 
 In 1984 there was a one wicket final  
in aid of Joe Weaden.And there is a    
bench there that has a plaque on it to 
remember him.                          
 The under 15's got through the        
semi-final of a competition but they   
got beaten by Press Steel in the final.
 There is an old green shed in the     
corner of the field which used to be   
used as the dressing rooms!But now     
there is a proper pavilion.            
 The men look forward to the end of the
match when some of the mum's put on a  
cricket tea;then afterwards....a pint!
