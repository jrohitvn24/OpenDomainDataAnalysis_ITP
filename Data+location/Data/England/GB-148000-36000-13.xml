		<title>13HOMELIFE AT AMALWHIDDEN.</title>
		<content>  Gloria Hollow lives in the country so
 she shops once a week in Penzance or  
 Hayle &amp; daily in Halsetown.           
  She breeds 6 horses &amp; has one riding 
 horse. She also has goats &amp; bullocks. 
  The house is called Amalwhidden &amp; is 
 350 years old, it has been in the     
 family for a 100 years, she took over 
 8 years ago.                          
  They do some tourism now so they     
 converted all the barns into holiday  
 flats.                                
  In the lounge of the house is a 350  
 year old stove &amp; behind one of the    
 paintings is a time capsule.          
  Her husband is a tin miner in Geevor 
 &amp; provides the family income.         
  There is no public transport         
 available so Mr and Mrs Hollow need   
 two cars to reach their workplace and 
 shops.                                
                                       </content>
