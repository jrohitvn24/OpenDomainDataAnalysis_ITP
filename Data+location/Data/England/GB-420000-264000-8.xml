		<title>08Great Pinley Farm</title>
		<content> This covers 140 acres of land which   
 are used for wheat and arable crops,  
 no animals are kept at all.           
 In contrast to the other farms we have
 mentioned, the buildings here are more
 recent.  The house is about one       
 hundred years old and the outbuildings
 are about one hundred and fifty years 
 old.                                  
 Some of this land will be changed for 
 ever in the near future because plans 
 have been made to build part of a new 
 motorway across some of the fields.   
 Three small cottages, which are very  
 beautiful, will have to be demolished 
 to make way for this motorway.
