 We visited  a public house in Aigburth
 Vale. It  was called {Ye Olde House At
{Home}.                                
                                       
  The publican  today is a lady  called
 Mrs O'Brien. She gave us  a great deal
 of information about the place.       
                                       
  Part  of  the  building  had formerly
 been  a  dairy.  Certain artefacts had
 been found  there.  China dolls heads,
 an example  of  scrimshaw  and a plate
 dating from the 1940's showing the two
 princesses, Elizabeth and Margaret.   
                                       
  She spoke of Hellfire Square,  a name
 given  to  the place  where  arguments
 were settled. We could find no trace  
 of this.
