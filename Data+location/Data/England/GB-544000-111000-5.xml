		<title>05The Ecology of Ringmer</title>
		<content> Ringmer is situated at the foot of{   
{chalk downland}in a clay vale         
 containing small ponds and streams.   
{Plant and animal habitats}have been   
 reduced by : building of new estates, 
 use of pesticides, destruction of     
 hedgerows, piping of streams under-   
 ground, filling in of small ponds.    
 Indiscriminate picking of{wild flowers
 has reduced numbers of plants rather  
 than varieties. Recently there has    
 been an effective effort to educate   
 children in conservation.{Cowslips }  
 and{orchids}grow on the downs. The    
 death of almost all{elm trees}by{Dutch
{Elm Disease}has dramatically altered  
 the landscape. The area hosts a rich  
 and varied{fauna}including numerous   
 species of butterflies, birds and     
 other animals.{Glow-worms}no longer   
 seen but remembered by the elderly.
