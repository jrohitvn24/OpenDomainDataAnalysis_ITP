		<content> Ruislip Lido is a very pleasant place 
 to visit in the summer. The woods are 
 next to it,so lots of people go for   
 walks there and also go horse-riding. 
 The lake is very large and a small    
 part of it is separated for swimming  
 although it is not very clean.Also    
 there are small canoes and boats for  
 children.There is plenty of space to  
 sunbathe and have picnics.Swings and  
 slides along with sandpits are over   
 by the side of the water.A little     
 train runs part of the way around the 
 Lido.There is water-skiing on the rest
 of the lake and also competitions take
 place as well.In the winter they hold 
 Guy Fawkes night there,and it is a    
 spectacular sight to see all the      
 fireworks going up into the sky over  
 the floodlit water.
