		<title>07RESERVOIRS IN HELMSHORE.</title>
		<content> The reservoirs are large ditches in   
 the ground which store water. Every   
 month people put fish in  and people  
 fish there, if they have a permit.    
                                       
 Dirty water is processed at the filter
 station  and then it goes into the    
 homes of local residents after it has 
 been purified.                        
                                       
 One of the biggest reservoirs in our  
 area is called the{Ogden Reservoir}and
 under the Ogden reservoir is a village
 called Grane. Many years ago some of  
 the villagers stole gold from the     
 church. Stone by stone the church was 
 removed and rebuilt on another site   
 near the Holden Arms. As a punishment 
 they flooded the village and made it  
 into a reservoir, as it remains today.
