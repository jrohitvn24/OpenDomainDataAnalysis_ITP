		<content>{Cats:}Those that we saw in the Blue   
 Cross Home at Kimpton were very       
 playful and the kittens were sharing a
 compartment with some rabbits. There  
 was another section for the fully     
 grown cats and they were just lazing  
 about.                                
{Horses:}Ponies and horses that have   
 become too old for a working life may 
 be brought to Kimpton to finish their 
 days as "pensioners". Ill treated     
 horses are sometimes brought in and in
 that case may be allowed out to other 
 homes on loan.                        
 At present there are 3 horses, 2      
 ponies,and 2 donkeys in the field;    
 with a stable to use if they wish.    
{Any others:}There are also rabbits    
 that live in the same block as the    
 cats. In the past the home has        
 housed guinea pigs, hamsters and even 
 pet mice.                             </content>
