		<title>19Aire Valley Trunk Road</title>
		<content>    It has been proposed for a long    
 time to build a road through the Aire 
 Valley to take traffic off the A629   
 trunk road.  Alternative plans were   
 made several years ago and an Inquiry 
 held.  Now builders are getting ready 
 to start construction.  Some people   
 argue as to whether it is needed.  We 
 did a survey of the present traffic.  
                                       
 COMMERCIAL VEHICLES - 250 per hour    
 CARS                - 820 per hour    
 BUSES               -  12 per hour    
                                       
    The proposed route will cause some 
 people to be rehoused. Naturally the  
 occupiers are not keen.It will also go
 straight through Marley playing fields
  used a lot by local schools and clubs
 There has been much local argument    
 over the issues involved but it now   
 seems the new road will go ahead.     </content>
