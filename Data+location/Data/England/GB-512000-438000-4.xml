{School }is about seventeen years old  
 and has about 197 pupils, a           
 headmaster, and seven teachers. Many  
 other people help at school at dinner 
 time, helping us cross the road and   
 keeping the school clean.             
   Next door is a nursery unit for     
 children who are not yet old enough   
 for school. It is run by a teacher and
 two nursery nurses.                   
                                       
 Each class does most of its lessons   
 with one teacher. At the end of the   
 year the classes move on to another   
 teacher and the oldest children move  
 to a comprehensive school about eight 
 miles away. The boys and girls are    
 taken to this school by bus. Another  
 bus brings children from the villages 
 of Swine and Coniston to Skirlaugh    
 School.                               </content>
