		<title>17TATHALL  END</title>
		<content>Tathall End is a quiet isolated village
and does not have a church or even a   
pub.One of its main features is the    
stream or brook that flows into the    
river Ouse at Newport Pagnell.There    
have been little bridges built over the
brook for access to houses on that side
of the road.There are quite a few man  
made ponds to stop the fields from     
flooding.The livestock and wildlife in 
the fields include cows,sheep,horses   
and ducks.There are also fish,trees and
hedgerows.To the nearest village with  
shops is exactly 1.4 miles but to the  
nearest shopping centre which is Milton
Keynes, would be 6 miles.It would take 
11 minutes to get there.There are two  
farms in the village and each own a lot
of livestock.It is a little village    
with ten houses but we think its a     
great place to live. By JAMES DUCKETT  
and NIGEL GINGER.                      </content>
