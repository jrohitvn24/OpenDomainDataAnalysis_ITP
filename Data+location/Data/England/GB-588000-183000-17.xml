		<title>17Southend:The Pier</title>
		<content>    Perhaps the most famous feature of 
 Southend is the{pleasure pier}which is
 the longest one of tis kind in the    
 world.Before{1976}it ran{trains}to the
 end of its{1.25 mile}length to the    
{Lifeboat Station}and an amusement     
 arcade.Sadly,in 1976,the end of the   
 pier was destroyed by fire and has not
 yet been rebuilt although many plans  
 to reconstruct it have been submitted.
    At the shore end of the pier are   
 the popular{bowling}lanes which are   
 open to the public.Now the public     
 mainly use the pier for walking along 
 in the nice weather and for{fishing   
 during the fishing season.            
    Next to the pier is a popular      
 children's playground called{Peter    
{Pan's Playground}where they can enjoy 
 all sorts of rides from a big wheel to
 go-karting.
