		<content> We asked people what they thought of  
 this area:                            
 Most grown ups liked it because it is 
 pretty but most young people said it  
 was 'too boring' or had 'nothing to   
 do'.                                  
 A lot of the grown ups said they      
 didn't want it to change because it   
 was a quiet and beautiful place to    
 live in.The Area Dev. Scheme agrees.  
 We don't think it will change much    
 around here because there probably    
 won't be any factories and there's no 
 oil or anything like that.There are   
 less people living here than there    
 were and a lot of them have to drive  
 somewhere else to work.Farmers are    
 still living and working in the area  
 but most just live.One old person said
 it more lively when people worked     
 where they lived.She said people were 
 more together then.                   </content>
