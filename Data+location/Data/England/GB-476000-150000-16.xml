		<title>16DOGMERSFIELD PARK</title>
		<content> Dogmersfield Park originally formed   
 the private grounds of Dogmersfield   
 House. The house today,however, is in 
 separate ownership with only 27 acres 
 of ground still attached to it.The    
 remainder of the land is put to       
 agricultural use. It is evenly divided
 between rough, enclosed grazing land  
 and cereal crops. In addition there   
 are several copses and two lakes,     
 presumably part of the original       
 landscaping. The land undulates and   
 the cultivated parts are large areas  
 in the modern style with all old      
 hedgerows removed. There is a right of
 way running across the Park, but most 
 of it is inaccessible to the public.
