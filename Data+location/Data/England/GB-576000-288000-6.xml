		<title>06WEETING STEAM RALLY</title>
		<content> The great event of the year is the    
 Steam Rally, usually held in mid-July 
 over a Saturday and Sunday weekend.   
 Farmland owned by a resident, Mr.     
 Parrott is lent for the occasion and  
 he also exhibits some of his own      
 collection of steam traction engines. 
 Many other exhibitors attend such as  
 arts, crafts, charity stalls; there   
 are demonstrations by timber firms,   
 the local fire brigade and old methods
 of farming using contemporary         
 equipment.                            
 Both exhibitors and spectators come   
 from all over East Anglia for the     
 weekend.
