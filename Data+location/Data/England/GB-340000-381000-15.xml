		<title>15DOMESDAY SHOPPING SURVEY....</title>
		<content>    On Thursday 2nd. May, some children
 went to do a survey at the local shops
 - the Crescent.    Most people thought
 that  the area around the shops needed
 to be tidier. Most people thought that
 some shop-lifting went on. Some people
 thought  that a  cheap supermarket was
 needed  because the  prices  were  too
 dear.   One person said the least used
 shop could be made into a sports shop.
 Most people used  Gourleys or the Post
 Office.   Gourleys  is  a  food  shop.
 People  used   other   shops   at  the
 Crescent, but not as much. Most people
 said they would not like  to  live  in
 Speke Town Lane, near the shops.  Some
 of them said  they  would  like  seats
 there and  someone to clean around the
 shops everyday.
