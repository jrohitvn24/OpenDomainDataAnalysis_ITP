		<title>07Lifestyles in Saxilby Area</title>
		<content> Despite   its  proximity  to  Lincoln,
 Saxilby is still essentially rural  in
 its  reflection of fashion and beauty,
 the teenagers and young single working
 people being the ones  to  follow  the
 changing   clothing  fashions.  It  is
 probably the  same  young  people  and
 married  couples  where  both partners
 are working who go out of the  village
 for social contacts, shopping, leisure
 activities  and  entertainment such as
 clubs, pubs  and  cinemas.  The  older
 population  whilst  patronising  local
 hairdressers and shopping  in  Lincoln
 for  clothes  are more conservative in
 dress and appearance. The influence of
 social contacts  made  through  school
 and  work and its location are evident
 here, many people commuting out of the
 village to work. For the  elderly  and
 parents of young children the focus of
 social life probably lies in Saxilby. </content>
