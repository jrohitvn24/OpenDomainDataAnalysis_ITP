		<content> Manningtree is unusual because it has 
 an amateur dramatic society which owns
 its own theatre. The building used to 
 be a primary school owned by the      
 Methodist Church and it is now called 
 Wesley House. The Manifest Theatre    
 Group puts on four plays a year and   
 many members of Manningtree School    
 take part. The producer and guiding   
 spirit of the Manifest Theatre Group  
 is the local police sergeant who lives
 in Mistley called Sergeant Murfitt.   
 The plays are all sold out quickly    
 even though they run for a week, the  
 last play was called 'Chicago'.
