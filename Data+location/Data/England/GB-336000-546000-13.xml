		<title>13BISHOP OF CARLISLE: CAREER</title>
		<content>   Henry David Halsey was made Bishop  
 of Carlisle in 1972. He is the 64th   
 Bishop of Carlisle and this is his    
 last year of office. He is tall and of
 a slender build with grey hair.       
   When he first started in the Church 
 he was an assistant vicar for four to 
 five years. After a lot of hard work  
 he became a vicar.                    
   He was soon invited to become Rural 
 Dean and then became Archdeacon. He   
 proved to be a good Archdeacon and was
 asked to be Assistant to the Bishop.  
   In 1972 he eventually became the    
 Bishop of Carlisle and entered the    
 House of Lords.                       
   The Bishop attended the ten yearly  
 Lambeth Conference in 1978, and has   
 attended conferences in Zululand and  
 Matabeleland.
