		<title>04VILLAGE OF BUTLERS MARSTON.</title>
		<content> On the eastern edge of the "D Block"  
 the village of Butlers Marston is near
 the small river Dene in an open,      
 well-wooded landscape.The village     
 straddles the Kineton road (B4451),   
 itself constructed in 1771,and most of
 the old stone cottages date from about
 this period.A similar size to         
 Combrook,more and more new houses and 
 bungalows are being built around its  
 edges.The Gothic style Victorian      
 school is worthy of note.ALso of      
 interest is the total absence of a    
 public house.Slightly away from the   
 village is the manor house and the    
 parish church of St. Peter and St.    
 Paul.Originally Norman the church now 
 mainly dates from 1872.However fine   
 Norman stonework is to be found in the
 solid round piers of the south arcade.
 Population and employment follows the 
 same pattern as Combrook.             </content>
