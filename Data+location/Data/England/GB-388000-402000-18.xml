		<content>   Most of the shopkeepers in this area
 feel that the supermarket has taken   
 some, but not much, of their trade.   
 Many of them try to encourage local   
 shopping by putting advertising       
 posters in their windows. Almost all  
 shopkeepers are concerned about the   
 saftey of their premises these days.  
 Many of the shops are fitted with     
 burglar alarms and some have security 
 gates at the front. Some shopkeepers  
 live on the premises but most do not. 
 There are not many shopkeepers now who
 make their goods on the premises,     
 although the baker still often does.  
 Shopkeepers believe that most of their
 customers like the handiness and      
 personal service of the small local   
 shop.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
