		<title>17Eglingham C.E.First School.</title>
		<content>  The present school was built in{1868 
 to replace a single classroom school, 
 still standing. It was built in       
 sandstone mined from local quarries.  
 The land and building were donated{for
{the education of the children of      
{Eglingham parish.}When the school at  
 nearby{Old Bewick}closed the children 
 amalgamated at Eglingham, attending   
 until starting work at fourteen years.
 There were sometimes over one         
 hundred pupils in the two class rooms.
 Numbers gradually decreased and the   
 system changed so that children left  
 at eleven for senior schools elsewhere
  In{1981}there was another change to  
 the present system of from five to    
 nine years, after which pupils go to  
 Middle schools in Alnwick or Wooler.  
 Currently there are nineteen children,
 two teachers, a cook to provide meals,
 a part-time secretary and a cleaner.  </content>
