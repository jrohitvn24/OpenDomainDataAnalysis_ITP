		<title>16NESTON PLAYGROUND GAMES</title>
		<content> Hi! I'm Peter (a sparrow).I've just   
 flown over N.C.P.S.It looks like play 
 time I might as well go and sit on    
 that tree and watch the children      
 playing.I know, I'll tell you about   
 the games they play.Let's start with  
 that group over there in the          
 playground.They look as though they   
 are going to play Bulldogs.Bulldogs is
 a game where there is one person on   
 and two groups of children at each end
 of the playground in 'dens'.The object
 of the game is for the people in the  
 dens to get to the opposite den       
 without being ticked.If they do get   
 ticked they are then on with the other
 person. This carries on until everyone
 has been ticked, then whoever was     
 ticked first is on and they start     
 again.                                
             p.t.o.
