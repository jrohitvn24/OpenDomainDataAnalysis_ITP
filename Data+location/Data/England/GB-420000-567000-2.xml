		<content> There are{160 shops}in use in our area
 and there are 11 empty premises mainly
 because of{increasing rents and rates.
 Most of the shops are in groups of    
 more than 5 and there are very few    
{"corner shops"}left.69 of the shops   
 sell food of various types.           
{ 82%}of people interviewed shop more  
 than once a week and find shops within
 easy access for most of their needs   
 exept for large houeshold goods,such  
 as clothes and D.I.Y.There is a clear 
 need for banks.{Kingston Park Centre  
 was the most popular.It is clean,well 
 set out,has good parking and delivery 
 facilities.Presentation of other shops
 needs improvement.{72%}think there    
 should be more provision for young    
 children and better access for the    
 elderly or disabled.{54%}think prices 
 are reasonable.{93%}think that the    
 quality of the goods is adequate.     </content>
