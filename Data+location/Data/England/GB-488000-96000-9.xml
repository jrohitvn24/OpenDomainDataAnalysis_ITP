		<title>09MY SUNDAYS - LEAH GROWCOTT</title>
		<content> On Sundays we get up early and go to  
 Pagham Parish Church.  Afterwards we  
 have a cooked breakfast and then we go
 walking or swimming.  We go walking at
 Bignor or swimming at Birdham.  I like
 the drive to Birdham, especially the  
 duck pond which we pass.              
                                       
 When we get to the club we show our   
 membership cards.  There is a swimming
 pool, squash courts, tennis courts,   
 pub and children's room.   The club is
 called 'The Roman Way' and it takes   
 twenty minutes to get there from      
 Pagham.                               
                                       
 We have a late lunch, then we go and  
 visit my grandparents who live in     
 Aldwick.  When we come home, we watch 
 television until it's time for bed.
