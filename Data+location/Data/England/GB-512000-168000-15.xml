		<title>15MOLESEY LOCK</title>
		<content>{  Molesey Lock}is situated on the     
 River Thames just upstream from       
 Hampton Court Palace.                 
   It was{built in 1815}bacause in the 
 summer the river often dried out, and 
 as most of the goods sold in London   
 were transported by river trade was   
 affected.                             
   The lock-keeper operates the lock by
 turning a handle and opening the      
 gates.  When it is closed with boats  
 inside the man lets the water out     
 until it is at the same level as the  
 water under Hampton Court Bridge.  He 
 opens the gates and the boats go on   
 their journey.                        
{  Small boats like canoes can use the 
{rollers at the side of the lock.} In  
 the summer many people holiday on the 
 river and the lock is very busy.
