 Lancaster road, which is really the

 people caravan or camp on. At the

 on outside in Summer or any other     
 time. The pub is owned by Pat and Tony
 Kingsten. Four men work there         
 including in the kitchen and behind   
 the bar and seven women. They have two
 strips of horse brasses on the wall.  
 They do bed and breakfast and there   
 are five bedrooms. The favorite drink 
 for the men is beer and for women it  
 is lager. The favourite food for men  
 and women is chips,peas and steak and
