		<title>05BROMLEY AMBULANCE STATION</title>
		<content>    The ambulance station on Bromley   
 Common is built on the site of an old 
 pond - that's why it floods sometimes.
 It was built about twelve years ago   
 and is a very modern building. Eighty 
 three people work there. It takes     
 about five minutes to get to Bromley  
 Hospital by ambulance. They are       
 contacted directly from a switchboard 
 at Waterloo. The station officer said 
 that you should always make sure that 
 your ambulance is fully equipped.     
 There are ambulances for people who   
 can walk, people in wheelchairs and   
 those for emergencies.                
    We were shown the equipment carried
 by an emergency ambulance such as a   
 stretcher that opens like a pair of   
 scissors, inflatable splints, oxygen  
 equipment and maternity packs. The    
 most common reason for being called   
 out is when someone collapses.        </content>
