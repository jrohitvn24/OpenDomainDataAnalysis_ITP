		<title>10LONGNOR VILLAGE.</title>
		<content>Longnor is a tiny village set in the   
typical Staffordshire countryside.     
   It has 28 people living in it with a
total of 9 houses.We spoke to          
Mrs.Hoole who has lived there for 31   
years.She likes it a lot and the       
villagers call it a Hamlet.            
   There are no shops in the village   
so they travel into larger villages    
or towns to do their shopping.         
   The milk is delivered by the man    
from Wheaton Aston.The postman         
travels from Penkridge.Out of the nine 
cottages five are old farm cottages.   
   A stream passes through Longnor     
under a tiny hump backed bridge.The    
stream is called'The LONGNOR brook'.   
This village is worth a visit as the   
countryside around it is very pretty.
