		<title>13Blewburton Hill</title>
		<content>This lies to the East of the village of
Blewbury on the Western outskirts of   
Aston Upthorpe. There are the remains  
of an Iron Age Hill Fort dating from   
about 350BC on the top of this local   
landmark. It is not known why this     
ealiest settlement was abandoned but   
the process of settlement and          
abandonment took place at least twice  
after this the final destruction of the
settlement being in about 50AD. No     
further attempts were made to settle on
hill and the present village seems most
likely to have formed in post Roman    
times as a farming community.          
The hill is a local landmark with a few
trees to the south of the crest along  
the line of the old rampart and ditch.
