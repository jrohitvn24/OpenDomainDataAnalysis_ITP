		<title>12Education in Alderney I</title>
		<content>  Alderney has only one school for ages
 5-16 years.It must be one of the very 
 few all-age schools in the United     
 Kingdom.The infant department         
 has 54 pupils, junior 71 and senior 77
 making a total of 202. There are 15   
 teachers employed in the school; a    
 part-time grounds man, a care_taker   
 and several cleaners. The school has  
 11 classrooms, a hall/gymnasium,      
 a science laboratory, a woodwork/metal
 work shop, a domestic science room and
 a centre for children with special    
 needs. Outside there is a football    
 field, a swimming pool, two netball   
 courts and an infants playground.     
  The education system still retains   
 selection at 11 years old as embodied 
 in the 11+ exam.Pupils successful in  
 this exam are offered a place at one  
 of the schools in Guernsey.This means 
 the children board out in Guernsey.   </content>
