		<content>    Near the golf course is a beach    
 called Petitor beach.This is a "bare  
 bodies" beach where lots of men and   
 women come down to get sunburnt.      
    This is what Julia thinks about the
 beach.                                
    "I think it's disgusting the way   
 the council let people take all their 
 clothes off so they can sunbathe naked
 .Any respectful person could walk     
 along the coastle path and see all    
 these naked people.The locals should  
 be ashamed of themselves!The grockles,
 alias holiday makers,should have more 
 respect for someone else's town.      
     This is what Claire thinks.       
     "Petitor beach is down in a ditch 
 where nobody can see.If you want to   
 look at the beach you have to go down 
 and look through the trees.Old people 
 couldn't get there anyway.Why can't   
 they have Petitor as a nudist beach?  </content>
