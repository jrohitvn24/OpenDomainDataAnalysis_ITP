		<title>03FARMING IN GOXHILL CONT.</title>
		<content> Goxhill has a number of small areas of
 traditional permanent grass meadow.   
 These are used by small dairy farmers 
 or as grazing for ponies of which     
 there are many - they outnumber dogs  
 as pets within the village.           
 Soft fruit is grown in and around     
 Goxhill. Raspberries, blackcurrants,  
 strawberries and gooseberries are all 
 grown and harvested in the "Pick Your 
 Own" style when in season. The area   
 was particularly famous for its       
 tomatoes and salad vegetables in the  
 recent past. High labour and heating  
 costs drove the owners out of this    
 form of agriculture and the           
 greenhouses are now used for the      
 cultivation of flowers, as in the case
 of Hawthorne Gardens. Much of the soft
 fruit farming and horticulture is     
 carried out by families of Dutch      
 origin.                               </content>
