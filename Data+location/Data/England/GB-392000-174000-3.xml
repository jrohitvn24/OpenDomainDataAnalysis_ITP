		<title>03    St Nicholas Church</title>
		<content>  The second church in the Eastern     
 half of the block is in{Tytherton     
{Lucas}and is dedicated to{St Nicholas,
 better known as Father Christmas. We  
 do not know when the church was built,
 but in 1272 the chapel and rectory of 
 St Nicholas belonged to the Parish    
 Church of Chippenham. About two       
 hundred years ago it burnt down but   
 was rebuilt.                          
  The large font is possibly of Norman 
 date. The chancel and side aisles have
 thirteen stained glass windows. There 
 is a single bell and most of the wall 
 memorials are in memory of the Crook  
 family.There is a service every       
 Sunday: the first and third Sundays in
 the month are Holy Communion, Mattins 
 is on the second and fourth and if    
 there is a fifth Sunday it is Family  
 Communion. The vicar is the parish    
 priest of Chippenham.                 </content>
