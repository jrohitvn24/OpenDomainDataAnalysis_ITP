		<content> In 1985 bows and arrows are still     
 being sold by Severn Products from    
 their retail section in the Boreley   
 lanes east of the river not far from  
 Holt Farm caravan site.  The business 
 started in 1958, originally making    
 bows and arrows; mass produced bows   
 are now imported from Japan and Korea.
 Aluminium shafts for arrows are       
 imported from the U.S.A. Bows and     
 arrows are assembled at Astley and    
 sold from Boreley. Much selling is by 
 mail-order to places in Britain and   
 abroad. One bow and one arrow are     
 Severn Products' designs.  Fibre glass
 and plastic now join traditional wood 
 and feathers in manufacture. The only 
 use for these bows and arrows is for  
 target archery, an increasingly       
 popular sport. Nine local employees.
