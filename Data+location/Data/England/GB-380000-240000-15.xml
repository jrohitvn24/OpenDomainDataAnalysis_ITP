		<content> Most of the food which the cows eat is
 grass.In the summer they go out into  
 the fields.In the winter the cows eat 
 grass in the form of hay and silage.  
 The farmer thinks that silage is best 
 for the cows,and he grows special     
 grass for making into silage.He puts  
 fertilizer on the grass costing Â£140 a
 tonne.He buys in cattle cake for the  
 cows at Â£150 a tonne.Because he does  
 not grow cereal crops he buys in straw
 from his neighbours at around Â£75 a   
 tonne.This family farm is like a      
 factory.In 1985 the farmer is only    
 allowed by law to produce a certain   
 amount of milk.Although when asked,   
 this farmer said that he would like to
 produce more milk,he felt it unlikely 
 that he would change to some other    
 kind of farming.
