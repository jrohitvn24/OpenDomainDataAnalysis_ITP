		<content>{THE FARNLEY VALLEY BALANCING RESERVOIR
 was built to prevent the beck flooding
 in Wortley -lower down the valley.    
 The water is not for drinking. The    
 earth dug out for the reservoir was   
 used to build terraced playing fields 
 nearby. A dam was built parallel to   
 Tong Road. 16 holes in the dam control
 the water flow. In dry weather the    
 reservoir contains about 12 million   
 gallons and is less than 1 metre deep.
 In severe weather the reservoir can   
 hold over 47 million gallons and be   
 over 3 metres deep. From the dam you  
 can look across to the three islands  
 and down to the water birds below.    
 Ducks, ducklings, swans, cygnets,     
 coots, geese, gulls and other birds   
 can be seen. Bushes are growing around
 the reservoir. There is a lot of      
 rubbish in the reservoir. The very    
 busy ring road runs by the south side.</content>
