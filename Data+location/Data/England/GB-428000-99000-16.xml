		<content>    The Filly Inn is situated on the   
 verge of the A337 at Setley 1.75km    
 south of Brockenhurst and giving a    
 beautiful view across open forest     
 towards Sway.                         
   Formerly known as the 'Oddfellows   
 Arms' the Filly Inn is a free house   
 and is patronised by people of all    
 ages. It has a peaceful atmosphere and
 can cater for all tastes. The dimly   
 lit interior gives a good effect to   
 the decor which consists mainly of    
 farming and fishing implements of     
 yesteryear. Seating is available      
 outside but this can become noisy in  
 the summer when the A337 becomes busy 
 with holiday traffic.                 
   This public house serves pub lunches
 at reasonable prices; they consist of 
 cold meats, hot dishes and, of course,
 chips.                                
                                       </content>
