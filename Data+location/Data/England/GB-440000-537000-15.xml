		<title>15UNEMPLOYMENT</title>
		<content> The greatest cause of social concern  
 in this area is unemployment,         
 particularly amongst young people.    
 Traditional industries like           
 shipbuilding and mining have declined 
 and new industries like engineering   
 have failed to replace them. The      
 current depression has made things    
 worse and the apparent difference     
 between north and south is resented.  
 Those without a job often feel useless
 and inadequate, particularly if they  
 have never had one. Boredom is a great
 problem amongst young people which    
 sometimes leads to crime and          
 vandalism. With the increase of       
 leisure this is a problem which we    
 must overcome in the future.
