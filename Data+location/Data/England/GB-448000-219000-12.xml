		<title>12Lamb-Ale in Kirtlington</title>
		<content> his custom, held on Trinity Monday,   
originated, we believe, in 1724. All   
the maidens of the village used to have
their thumbs tied behind their backs   
and a few lambs would be let loose in  
the field with the maidens. The first  
maiden to catch a lamb would be the    
Lady of the Lamb. There was a field    
containing wheat and barley. The wheat 
was made into pastry and the barley    
into ale. The lamb would be part baked,
part boiled, roasted and made into a   
pie. The Festival was revived in 1980  
with a procession through the village  
led by the Lord and Lady of the Lamb.  
Ladies and children from Kirtlington   
dress up and join together with Morris 
Dancers who come from many parts of the
country each year. A special Church    
Service is held,Morris Men dance in the
school playground and at local inns. A 
Feast is held and the Fair visits too. </content>
