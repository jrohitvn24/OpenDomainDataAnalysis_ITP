 owners and was used as a family home  
 until 1984 when it was bought by a    
 Canadian Company concerned with{'Time 
{Share'}accommodation. The 98 acre     
 Estate was then split up and sold at  
 auction. Twenty acres were retained   
 for a hotel development.              
   The new owners hope to attract rich 
{executives}from N.America with busi-  
 ness interests in London and 'leisure'

 restored and 18 suites designed each  
 of their own style and character. As

 hopes to provide leisure activities:

 pool &amp; formal gardens. There will be
