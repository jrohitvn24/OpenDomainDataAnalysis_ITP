		<content> William Vinnicombe of Bridgerule      
    Bridgerule is steeped in history   
 and it is an interesting fact that a  
 local family built numerous properties
 which are very much in evidence today.
    Mr. William Vinnicombe (senior)    
 built Southlands, whilst his sons     
 William and James (all were master    
 stone masons) built Bridgerule School 
 in 1872.                              
    William Vinnicombe (junior)        
 appeared to be the most prolific      
 builder in the area, being responsible
 for building the Mill House (not the  
 dwelling house) and all the           
 outbuildings at the old Vicarage (now 
 The Glebe), with all the stone being  
 drawn from Churchtown Hill Quarry and 
 Roly Poly Quarry. He also built The   
 Villa, rebuilt The Sanctuary and was  
 involved with many other properties in
 the surrounding area.                 </content>
