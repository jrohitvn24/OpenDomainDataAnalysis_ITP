		<title>07"Metheringham Fire Station"</title>
		<content> The Fire Station is on the corner of  
 Fen Road and the new by pass. They    
 have one fire engine and twelve       
 firemen. The Fire Station  was opened 
 in 1947, just after the 2nd.World War.
 All the firemen have to have a        
 "bleeper"to warn them when there is a 
 fire because they all have other jobs 
 as well. They receive a "retaining"   
 fee and a call out fee. They practise 
 on Monday nights, for two hours,except
 for Bank Holidays when it is changed  
 to Wednesday.They get between 70 to 80
 fires a year. They also go to road    
 traffic accidents, pump out flooded   
 buildings,put out stubble fires which 
 have got out of control and rescue    
 people and animals who are in         
 difficulty.
