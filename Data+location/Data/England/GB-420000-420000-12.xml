 There is a cool breeze. At the bottom 
 of the garden the{Berberis Darwinni}is
 in full bloom. Some{sparrows}were     
 feeding at the wild bird feeder.      
{MAY 12th 1985                         
 It is very cold and there are not many
 insects about, but I saw a small{bee} 
 in the Berberis. There was a{magpie}on
 the fence at the bottom of the garden.
{MAY 13th 1985                         
 It is a cold and windy day. A lot of  
 the{blossom}has been blown from the   
 trees. I found a{two spotted ladybird}
 on the landing window. Perhaps it has 
 come inside to shelter from the cold. 
{MAY 14th 1985                         
 Today it has been raining very hard   
 with some thunder and lightning as    
 well. I saw 3{seagulls}in the school  
 playground. I also saw a{blackbird}   
 pulling a worm from the damp grass.   </content>
