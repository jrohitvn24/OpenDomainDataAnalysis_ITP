		<content> As in many comparable villages        
{facilities available have declined}in 
 Petham since 1945. The baker,cobbler, 
 blacksmith, post office, garage and   
 shops have all gone - the last shop   
 closed 6 years ago. The only form of  
{retailing}is provided by the public   
 house and 2 roadside outlets for fruit
 and vegetables. The{bus timetable}has 
 been cut back but supplemented by a   
{post bus}which takes the mail and     
 passengers. There is a doorstep{milk  
 and{newspaper delivery}and a grocery  
 van visits each week. A mobile{library
 visits and a{doctor's surgery}is held 
 weekly in the Parish Hall. Most of the
 Parish has mains water, electricity,  
 telephone and drainage but no gas     
 supply. The village school provides   
 primary{education}and there is a      
 non-conformist{chapel and the Church  
 of 'All Saints'.                      </content>
