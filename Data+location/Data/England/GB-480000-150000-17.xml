		<content> One of the playground games we play is
 a game called{"It around the  wall"   
 Someone's It and they've  got to      
 chase the rest of the people round a  
 wall in the playground.The dust bin is
 home.Once you've tounched someone     
 they can't touch you back.            
        The person who's it counts to  
 a hundred.Everyone else hides when she
 has finished. She looks for the people
 who are hiding and tries not to let   
 any body touch the post and say       
 1_2_3 out! If you spot someone you    
 both try and get home firstand say 123
 out.Who ever spotted you can save     
 people by touching the post shouting  
 1_2_3 in, save all!                   
        Many skipping and singing games
 are played.A clapping game is the     
 Duke's Daughter, played in twos.A     
 favourite game is"{Last one in the    
{Semi"}= Crossing over safely.         </content>
