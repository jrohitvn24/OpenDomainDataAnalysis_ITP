 In 1985 our parish church of St.      
 Mary's is a hundred years old so there
 have been some centenary              
 celebrations.The first service was    
 held in February to celebrate the     
 first service held in February        
 1885.To start the celebrations a peal 
 of bells was rung on the Saturday.The 
 curate led the service because we had 
 no vicar at that time.The church      
 school choir sang'At the name of      
 Jesus'.The Arch Deacon Peter Vaughan  
 preached the sermon.Some students,who 
 were on a church mission, did a play  
 for us.                               
 In the church centre,after the        
 service,                              
 there was a large centenary cake in   
 the shape of the church baked by a    
 parishoner and everyone in church had 
 a piece of the birthday cake.         </content>
