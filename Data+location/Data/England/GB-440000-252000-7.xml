{SERVICE }&amp; all the firemen have other 
 jobs &amp; are called to the Fire Station 
 by means of a radio bleeper. In just  
 two minutes, the six men have put on  
 their heavy coats with shiny buttons, 
 a pair of rubber boots with metal toe 
 caps, yellow waterproof trousers &amp; a  
 fibreglass helmet. A computer prints  
 out their venue,&amp; the type of incident
 &amp; the engine races out with siren     
 blaring &amp; lights flashing.The pump    
 carries some water, but this is not   
 used if there is a Hydrant nearby.It  
 can pump 750 gallons a water each     
 minute. They carry foam to smother    
 chemical fires, rescue lines &amp;        
 powerful cutters.  They spend much    
 time going to road accidents, and save
 many lives by cutting people from     
 vehicles involved in road accidents.
