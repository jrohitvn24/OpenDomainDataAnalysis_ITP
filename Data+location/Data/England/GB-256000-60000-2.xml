		<title>02THE VILLAGE OF LEE MOOR.</title>
		<content> Before the discovery of china clay in 
 the area,there were very few          
 buildings,just several farms.In the   
 1830's china clay started to be taken 
 from just below the surface and people
 started to move to the area for work. 
 Since then the village has grown,     
 providing a community for workers to  
 live in.There was a school until      
 several years ago but now few children
 live in the village.There are two     
 churches,one Methodist and the other  
 Anglican.There is a small post office 
 and a shop which is open in the       
 mornings.The village is surrounded by 
 china clay workings.Several of the    
 waste tips have been grassed which    
 helps to cut down the dust.The village
 has various sporting facilities and a 
 village hall where various clubs      
 meet.Over half of the population is   
 retired.                              </content>
