		<title>18A Day In The Life Of Leon.</title>
		<content> At 6.40am I get up and have breakfast 
 then I get washed and dressed and pack
 my bag. Then I leave for school. When 
 I get to school we play football on   
 the playground with a tennis ball. The
 bell goes at 8.50am for the start of  
 school. Then we work until 10.30am.   
 Then we have play time which lasts for
 15 minutes. Then we work until 12.00  
 midday. We then have an hour for      
 lunch. We start work again at         
 1.00pm. At 3.00pm we go home. I get   
 changed and go to call for my friends.
 At 6.00pm I go in for my tea and go   
 back out until 8.30pm. When I come in 
 and watch television until 9.30pm.    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
