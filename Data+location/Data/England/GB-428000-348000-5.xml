 Most of the children attend clubs.    
 All the fourth year girls go to the   
 riding school. The fourth year boy    
 goes to football club and the squash  
 club. One of the  third year girls    
 goes to guides and one goes to the    
 squash club and the other goes to     
 riding school. One second year goes   
 to Gym club another one goes to cubs. 
 The second year girl goes to sunday   
 school with one of the first          
 year girls. The rest dont go to clubs.
 children living on the main road dont 
 play out much. Those living near the  
 green play out a lot. The boys ride   
 their bikes and the girls play at     
 dressing up and play with their       
 dolls. The older girls go riding      
 or help at the stables.
