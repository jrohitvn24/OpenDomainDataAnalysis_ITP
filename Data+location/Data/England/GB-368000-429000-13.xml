		<title>13FRIDAY - A EUROPEAN LADY</title>
		<content>In the morning I get up at 7.30am., I  
get washed and dressed, wake the two   
children, Peter and Stephen, then go   
downstairs to make breakfast.          
In the meantime my husband gets up.    
After breakfast the children get ready 
for school, they usually leave home at 
about 8.30am. My husband leaves at     
8.15am. I feed the dod and tidy round  
before going to work. My job is as a   
home help and my first visit is to an  
old lady of 93. I help her out of bed  
and get her dressed, and then I go     
shopping for her.                      
My next visit is to a man near         
Corporation Park, I also do his        
shopping.                              
In the afternoon I visit my parents    
and sometimes go into town shopping.   
At 3.15pm. I go home to meet the       
children from school. My husband comes 
home at 6.30pm. and eats tea on his own</content>
