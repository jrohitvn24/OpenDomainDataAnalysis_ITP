 Hardres Church was built in 1690 on   
 the site of an earlier house.{Lower   
{Heppington's}Edwardian stables are    
 part of a former estate. The Georgian 
 house was demolished at the beginning 
 of the 20th century. The clock tower  
 with weather vane displaying a rampant
 white horse was used for target prac- 
 tice by soldiers in the 1939-45 war.  
 The holes can still be seen.          
{Nackington Farm}covers 700 acres of   
 vegetables and fruit. The Company     
 employs about 200 regular and casual  
 staff. Students and mothers with young
 children take this opportunity to earn
 money picking and sorting. Staff      
 facilities include transport to and   
 from work, a rest room, kitchen and a 
 creche. The public buy from the farm  
 shop often in bulk to freeze or use
