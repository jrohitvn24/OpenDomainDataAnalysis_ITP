		<content>I go to a swimming club called         
Haverhill Hurricanes.The coach is      
called Alan Lee. My teacher is called  
Julie Woodlie. Swimming keeps you fit  
and can save your life if you fall in a
river. We have a hat with the club name
printed on it and a club T shirt with  
the name printed on the back of it.    
                                       
My mum goes to weight watchers. They   
have keep fit, talks and raffles. She  
won a box of Slim-a-soup. She has lost 
5 stone so far. She goes once a week.  
                                       
Haverhill has a nuumber of clubs. There
are:  a concert club, sports clubs,    
keep fit clubs, toddlers' groups &amp;c.   
Many of them meet at schools in the    
evenings. The Sports Hall also gets    
used.
