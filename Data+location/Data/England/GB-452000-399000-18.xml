		<content> The{1981 census}indicated that 80% of 
 houses in Warmsworth were owner       
 occupied and 20% were council         
 rented.Two purpose built disabled     
 persons bungalows are owned by the    
 council in the area.During last year  
 no new building was carried out in the
 council sector and the number of      
 houses in Warmsworth makes a total of 
 1440.The average cost of a council    
 house is between{Â£22,500}and{Â£26,000  
 and the rate and rent charge depends  
 on the type of accommodation.         
 Complaints to the council vary but    
 tenants report defects to their       
 properties which are subsequently     
 repaired or may enquire about a       
 rebate.                               
    From first being on site ,a        
 contractor could build a house in 10  
 to 15 weeks. (continued on page 19)
