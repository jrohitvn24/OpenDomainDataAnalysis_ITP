		<title>01GURNARD.</title>
		<content> Gurnard is a small village on the     
 outskirts of Cowes.It is a very       
 peaceful place and much quieter than  
 Cowes.It is on the north side of the  
 Island facing the Mainland.There is   
 not much traffic and big lorries      
 hardly ever come through the village. 
 The main road is called Worsley Road  
 and there are three roads leading off 
 it.In the village there is one post   
 office and six or seven shops and     
 quite a lot of Victorian houses,      
 because Gurnard is a Victorian        
 village.There are many more houses    
 than shops.It is a very friendly place
 to live,because everyone knows        
 everyone which is nice.Lots of retired
 people live in Gurnard. The oldest one
 is a lady of 104.There is a church and
 a primary school in Gurnard.
