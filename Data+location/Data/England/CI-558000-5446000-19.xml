		<title>19A TYPICAL SATURDAY</title>
		<content>  We asked the 10 and 11 year olds in  
 our class how they spent each         
 Saturday. Most of them said that they 
 did the same things each week. A few  
 of the girls had dancing classes to go
 to in the morning. All the girls said 
 that they 'went to town' every        
 Saturday. This means that they go into
 St. Helier to go shopping. They meet a
 friend first, and then look around the
 clothes shops. A few of the boys have 
 paper rounds in the morning, and some 
 played football for their school or   
 cub-scout pack. Watching television is
 very popular amongst the boys,        
 'Saturday Superstore', a magazine     
 programme that lasts all morning was  
 the most commonly watched. In the     
 evening watching a video tape with the
 family or going to sleep at a friend's
 house were the most usual ways of     
 ending a Saturday.                    </content>
