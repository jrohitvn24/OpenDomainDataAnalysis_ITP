The agriculture of the region is very  
largely arable and the nature of what  
is grown reflects the current state of 
E.E.C subsidies. This year the         
second major crop is barley, perhaps   
reflecting the proximity of the        
maltings with wheat retaining the      
foremost position and oilseed rape     
quite prominent.Sugar Beet-once very   
common- is much less in evidence.      
There are some notable dairy herds to  
be found and a growing interest in     
viticulture with the Fynn Valley       
acquiring quite a name in this         
respect. A number of smallholdings are 
held and there is still a tradition of 
households keeping hens and ducks with 
a growing number keeping goats.
