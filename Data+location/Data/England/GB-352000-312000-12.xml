         _______________               
 There is a train that goes through    
 Upton Magna but you cannot get on or  
 off in Upton Magna because there is no
 station,you have to board at          
 Shrewsbury or Wellington.The lines go 
 from Wellington to Shrewsbury.There   
 are two tracks so the trains can pass 
 each other.The trains are owned by    
 British Rail.There was a station in   
 Upton Magna but it was demolished over
 nine years ago.The cottages by the    
 railtracks were stables and the house 
 used to be the Station Master.        </content>
