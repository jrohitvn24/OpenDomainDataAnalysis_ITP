		<content> Other animals include two sheepdogs to
 help round up the sheep. One called   
 Fly is 8 years old,the other is       
 called Shep and is being trained.     
      There are also Old English Game  
 fowl for eggs and two horses which the
 farmer uses to go hunting.            
      There are some traditional       
 buildings these are not very good for 
 housing many animals and are used for 
 rearing calves, stables and for the   
 palour and dairy. The other animals   
 and the hay and corn bins are all in  
 larger modern buildings.              
      For machinery on the farm there  
 are four tractors, a mower, hay bob,  
 plough and five trailers. The farmer  
 employs a contractor for forage       
 harvesting for silage and to combine  
 the barley.
