		<title>01LITTLE GADDESDEN AREA</title>
		<content> The greater part of the block consists
 of farm and woodland.The only built up
 area is Little Gaddesden and Ringshall
 .Farm buildings and other dwellings   
 are scattered.Employment was mostly on
 the land or at Ashridge House until   
 the Ashridge Estate was sold prior to 
 the war.The cottages were workers'    
 houses.Now the village is 80% commuter
 to offices and outside works and the  
 houses have been improved into very   
 expensive dwellings.There are council 
 houses and Old Peoples' bungalows.A   
 good proportion of the land is managed
 by the{National Trust.}It is a        
 beautiful area populated by 1400      
 people.There is a Church,School,      
 Swimming Pool,Garage,Hotel and        
 Shop.The amenities are few but the    
 Clubs and Societies plentiful.Many    
 Hikers and Walkers travel this area of
 the{Chiltern Hills.                   </content>
