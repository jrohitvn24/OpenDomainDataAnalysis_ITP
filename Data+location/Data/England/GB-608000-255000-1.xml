		<title>01An Introduction to Creeting</title>
		<content>    This area consists mainly of one   
village; Creeting St. Mary, though     
small parts of Creeting St. Peter and  
Coddenham are included.                
    Creeting St. Mary is an attractive 
village of 800 people.  Most of the    
land is used for growing wheat and     
barley.  The soil is mainly of heavy   
clay except for a small area of        
sandpit{S} and two or three marshy     
spots{S and N}.                        
    The river Gipping runs through the 
village from Stowmarket to Ipswich {W  
to S}. This attracts wild life and     
is popular for fishing.                
    The houses in Creeting vary from   
Tudor cottages to modern chalet        
bungalows. They are mainly found along 
one road which stretches from one      
end of the village to the other        
    Creeting St. Mary is within        
easy reach of Stowmarket and Ipswich.  </content>
