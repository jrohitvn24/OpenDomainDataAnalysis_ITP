		<title>18Living in a Country Village.</title>
		<content> We like living in this area because it
 is quiet and is not near any large    
 noisy factories.It is close to several
 towns where we can buy food and       
 clothes.We have no major roads.We have
 no pollution problem.We can attend the
 local nursery and  primary schools and
 at 11 yrs of age we only have 4 miles 
 to travel to Staindrop Secondary      
 School.We can also go to cubs,scouts, 
 brownies and youth club as well as    
 Sunday School.We have a Chapel and    
 Church in Cockfield.There is a        
 recreation ground for football,bowls, 
 cricket and tennis.We have a play park
 with a slide,swings and climbing      
 frame.A small branch libary opens each
 Wednesday.The fell is a useful and    
 enjoyable open space which allows more
 than the average number of children to
 have a horse to ride.We would not like
 to live in a town or city.            </content>
