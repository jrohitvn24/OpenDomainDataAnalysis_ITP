		<title>16  North Baddesley Church</title>
		<content>{     St. John The Baptist}            
 The oldest part of the church, which  
 dates from Norman Times, is the North 
 side. Inside the Rood Screen separates
 the Altar from the people.            
                                       
 In the big church chest the vestments 
 are kept. Behind the memorial for the 
 Chamberlaine family there are four    
 angels carved into the wall. The font 
 is by the door. It is made from stone.
                                       
 On the wall is the coat of arms of    
 George III. In 1760 it was used       
 as a chicken coop door.               
                                       
 In the graveyard Charles Smith, a     
 poacher, has two headstones. One laid 
 by friends and one laid by the        
 landowner. There is also the          
 gravestone of a man who supposidly    
 fell out of the tower.                </content>
