		<content>  Our area is in South Lincolnshire    
 bordering on the{Wash}in the part     
 which was formerly called Holland.The 
 land is flat and fertile and is       
 mainly used for{agriculture.}People   
 have lived in this part of the country
 since at least Roman times.The        
 population is small and scattered over
 the whole area.The land is            
 criss-crossed  by single track roads  
 and drainage dykes which eventually   
 drain into the sea through two pumping
 stations .The dykes are important     
 because most of the land is at or     
 below sea level.We are protected from 
 the sea by banks of earth which were  
 made as land has been reclaimed from  
 the sea.The{outmarsh}is used as a     
 recreation area,a bombing range ,     
 wildfowling and pasture for sheep and 
 cattle for local farmers,a custom     
 which goes back many years.           </content>
