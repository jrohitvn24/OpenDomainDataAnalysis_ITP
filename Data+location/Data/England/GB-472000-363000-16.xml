		<title>16RECREATION AROUND OSSINGTON.</title>
		<content>    Forms of{recreation}in this country
 area are quite varied. There is a     
 common interest in{gardening}with the 
 added bonus of producing fresh fruit  
 and vegetables for the home and       
 freezer. On a wider front, interests  
 range from taking an active part in   
{gymkhanas}and the showing of{shire    
{horses}and{goats}to playing{cricket,  
 watching{rugby}and{campanology.}Most  
 of these activities take place outside
 the block with which we are dealing   
 and it is necessary to travel to a    
 different area to participate in such 
 pursuits. There is an interest in     
{field sports}i.e.{hunting, shooting   
 and{fishing}although shooting rights  
 are strictly reserved. The land is    
 hunted over by hounds in pursuit of   
 foxes during the appropriate season   
 and with the permission of the land   
 owner.                                </content>
