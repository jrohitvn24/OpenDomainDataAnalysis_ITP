		<title>18A Schoolboy's Day in Alford</title>
		<content>  "A Primary school pupil" by Lee.     
 My brother is called Nigel and he is  
 nine years old. On school days he gets
 up at seven o clock to have his       
 breakfast and gets ready for school.  
 At about 8.20am he leaves the house   
 with my dad and goes to school, which 
 is Alford Primary School. At 9.00am he
 is ready to start lessons. At 10.25am 
 he has his mid_morning break and then 
 at 11.50am he has his packed lunch. At
 3.30pm Nigel and dad come home. Nigel 
 then usually goes out to play until   
 5.00pm when we have tea. He then again
 goes out to play, unless there is     
 something good on t.v, until about    
 8.00pm. He then has his supper and    
 goes to bed at 9.00pm. He goes        
 swimming at the John Spendluffe School
 on Tuesday and at the Grammar School  
 on Sundays.
