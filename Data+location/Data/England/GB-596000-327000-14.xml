		<title>14Safety at the Crossroads</title>
		<content> The transfer of the infants children  
 from their class at Great Ryburgh to  
 the Annexe at Stibbard in September   
 1981 focussed local concern on the    
 hazardous crossroads which the school 
 bus had to negotiate each day.        
 Representation was made by the        
 school's Headteacher, his governors,  
 the parish councils of Great Ryburgh  
 and Stibbard to the local authority   
 for improvements to visibility at the 
 crossroads, partly by the removal of a
 large tree on the south west corner. A
 serious motor accident at the         
 crossroads in which the owner of      
 Ryburgh Stores (not the present       
 owner) was badly injured finally      
 precipitated the removal of the tree  
 with the agreement of the landowner,  
 Thomas Cook Esq.
