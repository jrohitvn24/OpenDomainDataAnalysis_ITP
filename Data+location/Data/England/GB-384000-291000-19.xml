		<title>19The E in WombournE</title>
		<content> For many years the correct spelling of
Wombourne has been in doubt.Many of the
older residents  do not use the E. They
say  this is  the older and correct way
to  spell  it. However other  residents
claim the opposite is true.            
  The signs near  the  village  support
both views:some of them have the E,some
do not. They were erected by the County
Council over a number of years.        
  In  July  1985  the  signs  began  to
change.By night unknown persons painted
over  the E in  white so  changing  the
name to  Wombourn. Others added an E to
some of the signs without one!         
  The local  radio station was alerted.
Radio WM  interviewed local  residents,
the  post office staff, the police  and
the clerk to  the Parish Council.We are
not any wiser.                         
 So, today,although many residents live
in WOMBOURNE some live in WOMBOURN!!!!!</content>
