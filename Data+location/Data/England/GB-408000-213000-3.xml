		<content> The two churches in this area are     
 Northleach and Hampnet. There is only 
 one active clergyman, the Rev. Brown, 
 plus a few now retired. Church        
 activities include a Sunday School,   
 choir, Mothers Union and house        
 meetings, the latter being attended by
 8_30 people. Northleach church has two
 main services, 9.30 matins and 6.30   
 evensong with others during the week. 
 The Rev. Brown's ministry includes    
 visiting local schools and            
 responsibility as chaplain of the     
 hospital and visiting homes. Tourists 
 are important for the church's        
 accounts and upkeep about 12,000 _    
 15,000 visiting every year. The Rev.  
 Brown thinks that Northleach has a    
 duty to the community whilst having   
 its own special meaning. In the future
 the church hopes to bring together the
 community and to share the faith.     </content>
