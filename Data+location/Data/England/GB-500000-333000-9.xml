		<content> The villages of Braceby &amp; Sapperton   
 and the surrounding land form the     
 parish of Braceby and Sapperton. The  
 western boundary is the Roman road    
 "Long Hollow". The Parish has no      
 council but is entitled to send a     
 representative to form part of the    
 Ropsley &amp; District Parish Council.    
 It is also possible to become a member
 of the Ropsley &amp; Dist P.C by right as 
 parishoners live within 3 miles of    
 Ropsley. At present 2 people (1 man 1 
 woman) are on the P.C. The parish     
 is part of the South Kesteven District
 and Lincolnshire County Council area, 
 and for these is part of a larger     
 electoral area. The parish is part of 
 the Stamford and Spalding Constituency
 (until 1983 it was part of the Rutland
 &amp; Stamford Const.) The M.P. is Sir    
 Kenneth Lewis, a Conservative. Both   
 District and County are Conservative. </content>
