		<title>11A Day in My Life June 28th</title>
		<content>I got up at 8.00 I went down stairs I  
had some cereal.I got dressed and      
watched televison .I went to school in 
the car and took my bike as well so I  
could bike home after school.After the 
register we had a maths test,and when  
break time came I went outside and     
played a game called bulldog.The object
of the game was to get from one side of
the playground to the other without    
being tagged.After break I did         
english,spelling workshop and some more
maths .At lunch time we all went into  
the hall and had lunch I had sandwiches
.Straight after lunch we went outside  
for play time I practised running on   
the school track.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
