		<title>09Ashurst School</title>
		<content> Ashurst School was opened in 1872. The
 local education authority wished to   
 close the tiny school in 1969 but a   
 vigorous local campaign saved it and  
 it has in fact grown somewhat in size 
 since then and now florishes with a   
 fine reputation.  The adjacent School 
 House, once the Headmaster's house,   
 has                                   
 been brought into use as part of the  
 school complex.  The school today has 
 40 pupils in two classes: 21 in an all
 age infant class and 19 in an all age 
 junior class.                         
                                       
 There are two full time teachers and a
 Headmaster as well as a school        
 secratary.  The present headmaster has
 served for 9 years: his two fore      
 runners for 33 and 38 years.
