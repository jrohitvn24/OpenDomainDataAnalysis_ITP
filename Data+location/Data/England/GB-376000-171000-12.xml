		<title>12RECREATION IN MARSHFIELD</title>
		<content> During the Summer there is a cricket  
 team who have their own field and     
 social club on the edge of the        
 village.  A very successful moto-cross
 club also perform during the warmer   
 months.  In the Winter two football   
 teams play on Saturday afternoons and 
 Sunday mornings, each having a pitch  
 on the recreation ground.  Badminton  
 is played in the Church Hall on       
 Tuesday evenings while the local Inns 
 have teams competing in darts,        
 cribbage and pool leagues.  An annual 
 event occurring every September is a  
 six mile "fun run" in which many      
 villagers compete, some seriously and 
 some, as the name says, "just for     
 fun". Many contestants are sponsored  
 for charities. Some horses are kept   
 for hacking, show jumping and         
 eventing. The countryside is ideal for
 walking and bird watching.            </content>
