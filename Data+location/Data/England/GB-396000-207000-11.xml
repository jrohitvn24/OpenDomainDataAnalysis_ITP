		<title>11AMENITIES,DUNTISBNOURNE AREA</title>
		<content> We found few amenities.One important  
 part of Community life, the village   
 school, has disappeared from both     
 villages.Children go to Birdlip or    
 Daglingworth Primary and Cirencester  
 on a school bus for Secondary.In      
 Winstone there is a public service bus
 to Cirencester 2 days a week, in      
 Duntisbourne only once.Most people    
 said a car was a necessity.In fact    
 about 85% had their own car.Many      
 villagers are completely cut off in   
 winter until the snow plough comes    
 through and they have to rely on food 
 from the freezer.There are no village 
 shops.The only Post Office is in a    
 Council house in Winstone.Both        
 villages have a Telephone Kiosk.There 
 is no surgery; a doctor calls every   
 Tuesday at the Village Hall.There is  
 mains water(1936),electricity(1951),no
 gas supply or mains drainage.         </content>
