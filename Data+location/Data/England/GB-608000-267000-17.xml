    We called on a man who has lived in
Wickham Skeith for 69 years. We asked  
about the history of Wickham Skeith    
and we found out how transport has     
changed, there only used to be half a  
dozen cars in the village and now most 
people have cars.                      
    There used to be a water pump where
a signpost is now. It was the man's    
nearest water supply. They used to     
water the horses with buckets of water 
from the Grimmer.                      
     He has worked on a farm all of his
life. There used to be two horses to do
the farming.They were fed at 5.00 a.m. 
so that they were ready to work on the 
land at 7.00 a.m. In the summer the    
horses slept in the meadow, they were  
stabled in the winter. It was a busy   
place on a farm long ago.
