		<title>11MY FAMILY</title>
		<content> My Dad gets up about 6.45 and has to  
 feed our 10,000 chickens.After my Mum 
 has taken us to School, she starts to 
 collect eggs with two lady helpers. By
 now Dad has collected the ducks' eggs 
 and then he loads the vans with David,
 his full-time worker.When they are    
 full, David drives his van to Ipswich 
 market to sell the eggs. Dad goes on  
 his wholesale round for the rest of   
 the day. In the morning he goes to the
 Harwich area &amp; after lunch around     
 Clacton. My Mum has been grading the  
 eggs. She uses a machine which puts   
 them into their right sizes. Then she 
 does the bookwork for the business. By
 now its time to pick us up from School
 &amp; she gets the tea ready. When Dad    
 comes home, he cuts the grass while   
 Mum cleans the house &amp; does the       
 washing. We watch TV or read until its
 time for bed.                         </content>
