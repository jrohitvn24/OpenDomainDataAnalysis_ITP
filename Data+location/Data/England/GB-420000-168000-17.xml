 century by the Saxons.The interior of 
 the church is Georgian and there are  
 many interesting features including 2 
 identical pulpits.Also Mildenhall is 1
 of only 3 churches in Britain to have 
 shoulder high pews.Three years ago the
 church was badly in need of repair and
 Â£37,000 was raised to restore it to a 
 good condition.                       
  There have been 2,200{baptisms}in the
 church and 1,172{burials.}In the      
 graveyard only 200 graves are still   
 readable.
