		<content> My dad works an a farm. He drives     
 a big lorry used for carrying sheep,  
 pigs or cattle. He works for          
 Sternberg's Farms. Mr Sternberg or    
 Lord Plurenden was a big land owner in
 the Tenterden area . My dad drives    
 his lorry from place to place         
 collecting or moving the cattle or    
 pigs. Often my dad comes home very    
 late so I don't see him as much as I  
 would like. The manqger of the farm is
 Tom Forsythe. Now that Lord Plurenden 
 has died, his wife owns the farm but  
 she has managers to take charge of    
 each part of it. During the spring and
 summer my dad is extra busy.When it is
 time for the county show, the farm    
 sends lots of cattle. This year the   
 Sternberg cattle won first prize for  
 the Sannoa's.
