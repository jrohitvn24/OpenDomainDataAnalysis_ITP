		<content>    We tried to find out what kind of  
 work local people did. There are not  
 many people in the area who are       
 considered as 'locals', for most of   
 the larger houses have been bought by 
 professional people who work outside  
 the area. As most of the area is used 
 for farming, there are still some     
 local people who work on the farms.   
 One or two people have businesses     
 which are connected with furniture    
 making or renovating, operating from  
 their own premises. There are also    
 some people who sell their vegetable  
 produce. Ingatestone Nurseries employ 
 four full-time staff to sell a wide   
 range of garden plants and equipment  
 along the old Roman road. We also     
 found two boarding kennels in the     
 area, one of which is mentioned on    
 page 17.
