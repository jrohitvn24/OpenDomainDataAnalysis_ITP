		<title>15THE ASHTON-IN-M FAIR</title>
		<content> The Fair visits Ashton twice a year.It
 arrives on a Thursday and stays until 
 a Tuesday , it is open every          
 night apart from Sunday.It is situated
 on the market area although it is not 
 that big.It has much to attract both  
 young and old alike.There are stalls  
 with games to play and prizes to be   
 won.They also sell food and drink.The 
 Fair over many years has grown into a 
 family affair,though very recently the
 fun has been spoilt by mindless       
 youths who run around in gangs.
