		<title>18Mr.Phillips the Herbalist.</title>
		<content>{ Mr.Phillips}has learnt all about the 
 old craft of{herbalism}and started a  
 practice in Yockleton.The difference  
 between a herbalist and a doctor is   
 that a herbalist only uses medicines  
 made from plants and is not allowed to
 do operations.He had to study many of 
 the same things as a doctor,like      
 anatomy and all about diseases.He had 
 to learn about plants and which dis-  
 eases they can cure.                  
  His patients come from all over Shrop
 -shire.Some come much further than the
 doctors patients.He cannot have a lot 
 of patients because it takes him about
 an hour to listen to each one.He sees 
 patients in a special room in his own 
 house.He sends away for special medi- 
 cines for patients.He hopes to make   
 his own medicines when he has time.He 
 says a balanced diet,without additives
 is very important for good health.    </content>
