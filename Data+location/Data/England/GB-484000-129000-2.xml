		<content> cover the area, although only the     
 latter is wholly  contained within the
 block. The quite unspoilt hamlet of   
 Linchmere is set betwixt linchmere and
 Stanley Commons and is composed of an 
 ancient church built beside a narrow  
 lane flanked by a collection of       
 attractive mature cottages and a      
 handful of large imposing residences. 
 Half a mile to the north east of the  
 church is a District Council estate of
 40 houses and bungalows.              
 Stanely and Linchmere Commons are     
 covered by beach,birch and oak trees  
 as is most of the surrounding area,   
 although here, the traditional        
 woodland is being replaced by the     
 commercially profitable conifer type  
 of tree.
