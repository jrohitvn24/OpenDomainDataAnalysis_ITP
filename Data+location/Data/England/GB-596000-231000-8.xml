		<title>08BOY IN POP GROUP'S VIDEO</title>
		<content> My name is Robert Mead,I live at the  
 Rose &amp; Crown Gt. Horkesley.I was asked
 by Mark Wilkinson who is a commercial 
 artist to model for the cover of a    
 record called Kayleigh which reached  
 No.2 in the hit parade in June 1985 by
 a band called Marillion.I was also    
 asked to go to West Berlin to make a  
 video with the group which            
 accompanied the record and helped it  
 become a hit.I spent 2 days in Berlin 
 and very much enjoyed it.Since the    
 record the group released an albumn   
 called Misplaced Childhood which      
 reached No.3 in its first week after  
 being released.On the cover of which I
 was wearing a red Victorian military  
 tunic and blue trousers and was       
 carrying a magpie on my arm. Due to   
 the success of the record and albmn I 
 was asked to appear on the cover of   
 the groups next record named Laveder. </content>
