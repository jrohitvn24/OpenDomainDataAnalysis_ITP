		<title>01STAFFORD TOWN AND COUNTRY</title>
		<content>   Stafford is a typical small town    
which grew up within walls.The town    
centre has a fine Georgian house being 
used as the General Post Office,and the
largest Elizabethan timber-framed house
in England known as the High House.This
is being extensively restored.The River
Sow runs through a pleasant park.There 
is also a prison,and a railway station 
and a new recreation centre.Radiating  
out are streets of small late Victorian
houses dating from about 1930.The main 
building of the General Electric       
Company-Stafford's biggest employer -is
in this block,as are the new Stafford  
and District General Hospital and the  
Staffordshire Polytechnic.             
   By contrast a large percentage of   
the block is taken up by several new   
housing estates and many acres of      
farmland.                              
                                       </content>
