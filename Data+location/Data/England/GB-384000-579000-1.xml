		<title>01NORTH TYNEDALE (REDESMOUTH)</title>
		<content> This area lies in the{North Tyne      
 valley, southeast of Bellingham. It is
 hilly and mainly rough pasture. The   
 scattered farms are mainly engaged in 
 stock rearing for sale in the local   
 marts. There are also{wooded areas }on
 either side of the river, mixed       
 conifers, including spruce and larch  
 in the Countess Park wood, oak, ash,  
 beech and birch in the Lee Hall area. 
 The river{North Tyne}through the block
 from north to south and the Houxty    
 Burn crosses the south west corner,   
 joining the Tyne a little further     
 south. A former{railway}cutting       
 crosses the area and is now used by   
 walkers. The population is small and  
 scattered. Apart from a few private   
 dwellings the rest of the buildings   
 are{farms.}The main road from Hexham  
 to Bellingham goes through part of the
 block,from Fell End to Bank Head.     </content>
