		<content> We found out that there was an even   
 split between the number of homes     
 using electricity and gas to cook     
 their food.At the moment ten percent  
  of people asked, said they used a    
 microwave as their main way of        
 cooking.We are certain that this      
 percentage will increase in the       
 future.                               
    The most popular meal is the       
 traditional Roast Beef and Yorkshire  
 Pudding Sunday lunch.Other popular    
 meals were anything with Chips,       
 Chicken, dishes Salad and Pork.From   
 this there does not seem to be many   
 vegetarians in Pelsall.               
   Kebabs, Curry and Chinese were also 
 popular,which seems to show           
 that peoples taste in food is quite   
 wide and varied.
