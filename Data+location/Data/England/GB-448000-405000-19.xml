		<title>19Local Landscape S.Yorkshire.</title>
		<content> The{landscape}of our area consists of 
 farmland interspersed with{parkland.  
 Over the area there are lots of       
 interesting buildings giving a wide   
 variety of styles and sizes.There is  
 very little uniformity in the         
{landscape,}the four{villages}showing  
 both ribbon development and the       
 traditional pattern of a{village      
 around a central point.Hooton Pagnell 
 has first been awarded the Best Kept  
{Village}Award for the third           
 consecutive year.The planted{parkland 
 has greatly matured to an extent where
 many trees have fallen down.Many of   
 our largest and most beatiful trees   
 have had to be felled because of Dutch
{Elm}disease. This has meant a great   
 change in the{landscape.}We lost one  
{elm}tree in the school garden that was
 a feature of our local{landscape.}Many
 of walls and hedges are derelict.     </content>
