		<title>17DRAMA AND MUSIC IN HENFIELD.</title>
		<content>   There are many drama and music      
 societies in Henfield.  The Henfield  
 Players and the Henfield and District 
 Choral and Operatic Society produce   
 several productions a year.           
   Henfield Drama Group by James.      
   I go to a Drama Group on a Saturday.
 It costs Â£1.25 an hour.  We learn     
 plays and poems.  It is at 10 a.m. I  
 am the oldest boy.  There are four    
 boys and seven girls.                 
 Oliver Rehearsals by Christopher.     
   I was chosen to be in the musical   
 "Oliver".  I did an audition for      
 singing.  I was one of the three best 
 boy singers.  The second audition was 
 for acting.  I was not so successful  
 but I was chosen to be in the chorus. 
 We went to the Village hall for the   
 first rehearsal.  It was good because 
 I had to do some singing.  My Mum is  
 Widow Corney and Dad Bill Sykes.      </content>
