		<content> This block consists of limestone hill 
 country with a small village,         
 farmsteads, dales, mines and woodland.
 About 150 people live within the      
 block, but less than 50 gain a living 
 directly from its main resources of   
 farmland, minerals, trees, scenery and
 workplaces. Others travel to work far 
 and wide, or are supported by family  
 or state.                             
 The attractive countryside brings     
 extra visitors. It has roads,         
 footpaths and a picnic site. Two dales
 are a particularly special feature.   
 The village has a village hall with a 
 Public toilet, a picnic site and a    
 playground. All other needs are met in
 Youlgrave, Bakewell or beyond, which  
 can be reached by public bus or car.  
 The block lies within the bounds of   
 the Peak National Park.
