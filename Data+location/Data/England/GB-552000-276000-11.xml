 Most machinery was horse drawn        
 (ploughs, cultivators and threshing   
 machines). First tractor was bought in
 1940 and cost Â£126 (including a       
 plough). Transportng crops to market  
 in Ely was done by horse and cart and 
 took most of the day. Today machines  
 are common (Combine costs Â£35,000,    
 Tractor Â£18,000) and loading of large 
 articulated lorries is quick (half    
 hour) and easy. The number of men on  
 the land has diminished, one farm (250
 acres) from 10 men down to 3 and      
 another farm (2000 acres) down from 87
 men to 21.
