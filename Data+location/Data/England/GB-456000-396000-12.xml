		<content>   In our village the Community Centre 
 hosts lots of things, like the Youth  
 Club on Tuesdays and Wednesday at     
 7,30pm. They also have discos, usually
 run by Brownies or Scouts. Sometimes  
 the discos are a birthday treat       
 because you can hire the Community    
 Centre. Brownies are held there and   
 Bingo on Wednesdays. Playgroup is     
 every morning. In the Church Hall are 
 different recreations. Cubs at        
 7-00 to 8-30 on Wednesday, Scouts     
 6-30 to 8-30 on Friday, Venture scouts

 classes are held on Wednesdays. Also  
 there is Keep Fit. There is a church  
 and a chapel. There is an annual      
 Maypole, everyone in school taking    
 part. There are cricket teams and     
 football teams. 94% of the working    
 population of Wadworth work outside   
 the village, mainly in Doncaster.     </content>
