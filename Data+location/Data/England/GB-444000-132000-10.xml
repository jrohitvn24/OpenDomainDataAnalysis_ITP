		<title>10VISIT TO THE BARRACKS</title>
		<content> On the  12 of June   which was a      
 Wednesday we went to see Major        
 Williams at the Light   Division      
 Barracks.Sophie and I expected that   
 Major Williams to be in uniform and   
 was going to be very strict but he was
 quite the oposite.He was dressed in   
 home clothes, but all the soldiers    
 were dressed in proper uniform.He had 
 a small room.He had models of         
 Flowerdown and gave us a map and a    
 book of dress wear.Major Williams was 
 a very friendly man and even said we  
 could ring if we had forgotten        
 anything.He said that the people were 
 glad that Flowerdown is a barracks not
 a jail.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
