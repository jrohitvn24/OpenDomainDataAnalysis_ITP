 the Draycott Electoral Register.      
                                       
 The{Draycott parish council}meets     
 monthly at the village hall, its      
 meetings are formal but villagers who 
 attend are encouraged to contribute.

 raising about Â£1,800 for administering
 the parish. The cost to the ratepayer

 rates for the district council are Â£55
 and for the county council Â£550.
