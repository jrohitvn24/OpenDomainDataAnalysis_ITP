		<title>16Wide Game.</title>
		<content>  This game is played in Gloucester.   
 20_30 adults and children gather at   
 the foot of Robinswood Hill. A quarter
 of the group has "tails" fixed to     
 their backs and remain at the base.   
 The others proceed to hide half way up
 the hill. When all are ready, the     
 people with "tails" attempt to climb  
 to the top of the hill without having 
 their "tails" removed by the hidden   
 members of the game. Those who achieve
 this, receive token prizes _ usually  
 chocolate.                            
  Sometimes instead of "tails" each    
 player carries an "aircraft part".    
 The object then is to smuggle the     
 parts to the other side of the hill,  
 and there, assemble the aircraft.     
  This is a more difficult version of  
 the game, since, in order to win,     
 all the parts must be available, at   
 the other side of the hill.           </content>
