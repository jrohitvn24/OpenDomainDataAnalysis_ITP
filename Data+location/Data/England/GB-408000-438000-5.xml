		<title>05St.Ives Golf Course</title>
		<content> This golf course is situated in       
 beautiful surroundings. There is a    
 wood, a lake and moorland very close  
 to the course. It is not a private    
 club but is owned by the Local        
 Authority in Bradford and any member  
 of the public can join it for a small 
 fee.                                  
 It covers about 4 square miles of     
 land. There are 18 holes and a club   
 house in what used to be an old       
 mansion.                              
 This course has been there for 60     
 years. An international competition   
 has been held here and some famous    
 golfers such as Nick Faldo, Arnold    
 Palmer and Lee Trevino have played at 
 St.Ives.                              
 There is a golf shop near the first   
 tee where you can buy any equipment   
 necessary to play the game of golf.
