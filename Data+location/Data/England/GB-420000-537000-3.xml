		<title>03PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT-HOUSES</title>
		<content> Before 1970 very little private       
 development existed in this part of   
 the village. Indeed there were very   
 few private houses in Brandon at all. 
 A small area of 12 bungalows and 4    
 houses began in 1965 near the vicarage
 but it was not until 1975 that large  
 building  contractors almost          
 transformed Brandon into an area of   
 private development.A very large      
 private estate called "Dere Park" now 
 lies west of the Sawmills (O.S. map   
 reference 234393). A more exclusive   
 development where houses are          
 individually designed takes its name  
 from the small stream "Scripton Gill",
 Scripton being the name of the land   
 owners in the area years ago.
