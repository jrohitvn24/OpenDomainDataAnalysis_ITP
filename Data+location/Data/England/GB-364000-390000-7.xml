		<content> This park covers 20 hectares.It opened
 in 1980.The new Ranger Cabin and      
 changing rooms opened in 1983.The park
 has two permanent Rangers and three   
 temporary ones.In the park there are 6
 major play areas,3 football pitches,1 
 Rugby pitch,2 cricket pitches and a   
 five-a-side football or netball       
 pitch.There's a great BMX track       
 too.All this was made out of the Royal
 Ordnance Factory.During the war they  
 built 4 bunkers where they made bombs.
 Now the bunkers are empty but one is  
 going to be a World War 2 Museum.The  
 Rangers organise things in the parks  
 like competitions,bonfires,making     
 things like kites and nesting         
 boxes.They come to school and go out  
 with us to look at trees and birds.In 
 the walled garden they have a special 
 place for blind people to smell the   
 flowers and plants.                   </content>
