		<content>                                       
         In our area there are five    
churches,one chapel and one vicarage.  
However not many people go to church,  
in the Third year only 22 out of 78    
children go to church or Sunday school 
or some other place of worship.        
         Two people are Hindu and they 
go to a meeting once a month in West   
Bromich.One person is a Muslim and goes
to a Mosque.She does not go very often 
because there is not one in Stafford.  
         Nineteen people are Christian 
and go to a range of churches. Most of 
them of them go to the Church of       
England but four people go to the      
Baptist,two people go to the Methodist 
Chapel and one person goes to a Mormon 
Church.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
