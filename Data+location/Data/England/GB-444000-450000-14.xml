		<content>   We conducted a survey using the     
 children of 7 to 11 years of age in   
 our school to find out the things we  
 enjoy doing the most when we are not  
 at school.                            
 Activities include, sport, playing    
 with toys, going to youth club, going 
 on holiday, watching the TV/video and 
 playing with electronic games.        
   More sedentary activities include   
 reading, drawing and listening to     
 popular music. The 3 most popular ways
 of spending our spare time are youth  
 club, playing electronic games and    
 watching TV. Next in choice are       
 swimming and looking after our pets.  
   The things we dislike doing include 
 cleaning dad's car, shopping, filling 
 the coal bucket and having a bath. The
 greatest dislike was going to bed     
 early                                 
                                       </content>
