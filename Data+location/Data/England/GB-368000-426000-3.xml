		<title>03WILDLIFE IN BLACKBURN.</title>
		<content> There is a lot of wildlife in         
 Blackburn as well as any other town or
 city in England but as Blackburn has  
 a country park, part of the wildlife  
 is congregated there. Birds and       
 animals and many other types of       
 wildlife depend on{Witton Park}for    
 protection, eg great tits, magpies all
 build nests in the trees of           
 Witton. Foxes, rabbits and badgers,   
 all build underground homes in Witton.
 There are many other places in        
 Blackburn that support wildlife.      
 Fishmoor reservoir is just one of     
 these places, it supports an abundance
 of wildlife eg foxes, hares, stoats as
 well as fish. It has been noted that  
 the animals in question, face certain 
 dangers every day, from both natural  
 and manmade threats like predators and
 water and air pollution. However,we   
 are optimistic about the future.      </content>
