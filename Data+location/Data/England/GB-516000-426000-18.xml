		<title>18A MARKET FOR HEDON</title>
		<content>{Local News.}If you've been reading the
 local newspapers recently you will    
 know about the plans for a new        
 market.Some people are opposed to this
 but do they realise that Hedon has had
 markets in the past? In Hedon 400     
 years ago there was a{food and clothes
 market, and a fortnightly{cattle and  
{sheep sale}held at Market Hill.The    
 markets moved to{Market Place}and     
 continued up to 1886. At this time    
 there was a cattle plague which killed
 many cattle. The arrival of the       
 railway was another reason for the    
 closure of the local markets. In      
 Market Place a cruel sport called     
 Bull Baiting was held. The bull was   
 tied to a ring on the cobbled street  
 and was set upon by bulldogs or       
 mastiffs and was killed.The{Bull Ring 
 can still be seen in the present      
 Market Place.}                        </content>
