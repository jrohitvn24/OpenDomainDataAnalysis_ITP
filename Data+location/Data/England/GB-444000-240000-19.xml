		<title>19Traffic in Banbury cont'd.</title>
		<content>  We have quite a few lorries around   
coming through Banbury with different  
products such as cars, coal, different 
sorts of food and livestock.A lot of   
lorries come through the centre of     
Banbury because there are a lot of     
factories and shops here and because   
there are no roads going round Banbury.
  A new link road has just been made   
from Southam Road to Grimsbury and     
there are plans for a motorway to      
bypass Banbury but these have been held
up because some people didn't want the 
countryside to be spoiled by a         
motorway.                              
  There are some taxis in Banbury but  
not many.                              
  There are quite a few garages around.
  The only other form of travel through
Banbury is by boat on the canal. There 
is a lock near Spiceball.
