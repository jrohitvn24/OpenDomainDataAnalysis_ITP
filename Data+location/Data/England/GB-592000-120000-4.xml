		<title>04Sheep Farming in Rye Area</title>
		<content>  On Tuesday 7th May 1985 we went to   
 see a local farmer at his farm to ask 
 him some questions  about farming. We 
 asked him how many sheep he has got.  
 He has got 700 sheep and he has 850   
 lambs. He has 250 acres all at Iden,  
 Playden, near the Star Lock and East  
 Guildford. He has got 4 farm          
 buildings. He takes 20-40 sheep to    
 market when he goes. 800 get sold at  
 the market each week. It is quite     
 busy. He has got one sock lamb. He has
 neve had a bad season. 20 farmers take
 sheep to the market. He told us that  
 calves and rams were sold as well at  
 the market.
