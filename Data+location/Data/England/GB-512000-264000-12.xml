		<title>12 THE CHURCH OF ST. ANDREW</title>
		<content>    Saint Andrew's Church has served   
 the Spiritual needs of the community  
 for nearly 800 years. It was mentioned
 in the Domesday Survey of 1086, but of
 the original building nothing remains.
 The present building dates from the   
 mid 13th.Century.  Considerable recon-
 struction took place during the 14th. 
 and 15th.Centuries, the Vestry being  
 added in 1526.  The Church was        
 completely restored during 1866.      
    To preserve this much loved        
 building the Church Council - aided by
 a 40% grant from the Dept.of the      
 Environment - has now an ongoing plan 
 of restoration.                       
    As well as regular Communion and   
 Family Services at St. Andrew's, our  
 Vicar, Rev. Peter Taylor, has         
 encouraged ecumenical evening worship 
 in homes since the recent closure of  
 the Baptist Chapel.                   </content>
