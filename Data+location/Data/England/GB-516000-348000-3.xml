		<title>03Employment In South Kyme</title>
		<content>  In the past the majority of people   
 worked on local farms, but today, due 
 to the cut-back in employees, this    
 number has fallen considerably,       
 especially among women.               
  Some cottages, once 'tied' to the    
 farms, have been sold to private      
 owners, introducing a variety of      
 occupations. Several people travel out
 to work in offices, clothing and food 
 factories, garages, shops &amp; teaching. 
  A number of people are unemployed and
 depend upon State Benefit for their   
 income. Farmworkers relations with    
 their employers are reasonable &amp; some 
 workers belong to the Transport &amp;     
 General Worker's Union. Employment for
 school leavers is scarce, causing many
 to travel daily, or move away for     
 training or jobs. There are several   
 retired people, some are newcomers who
 have bought homes here.               </content>
