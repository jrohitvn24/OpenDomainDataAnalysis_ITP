		<title>16PUBLIC BUILDINGS, WILLINGDON</title>
		<content>   St. Mary the Virgin is the oldest   
 building in our area.There was a      
 church here at the time of the        
 Domesday Book but the present building
 is mainly 13th,14th and 15th century. 
 It is a greenstone and flint building 
 with a typical Sussex tower. Inside,  
 the tie beam roof looks like an upside
 down ship.                            
   Polegate tower windmill, built in   
 1817, is the most complete one of its 
 kind in Sussex. There are three sets  
 of grinding stones and all the wooden 
 machinery is complete. It is hoped    
 soon to lift the jammed cap with a    
 crane and fix it so that the mill can 
 grind again. The last miller's        
 daughter is one of the guides who show
 visitors around.
