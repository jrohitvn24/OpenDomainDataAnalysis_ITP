		<content> INTRODUCTION                          
  On Friday 12 July 1985 the farming   
 section of this project visited the   
 area to be surveyed.We decided not to 
 use the questionnaire but to base our 
 report on observation.A very good view
 of the farmland was obtained both from
 Ingra Tor and Sharpitor.Fields in the 
 lower part of the Walkham Valley were 
 cultivated for market produce far more
 than fields further up the valley     
 which changed from grassland to       
 moorland with increasing height.      
 LIVESTOCK                             
 Predominantly sheep.The type of sheep 
 was mainly"upland".The sheep were     
 sometimes in the same field as        
 bullocks and some sheep were grazed on
 common land with sheep owned by other 
 farmers,Eg.Huckworthy Common.The      
 identifying markings were mainly      
 coloured red.                         </content>
