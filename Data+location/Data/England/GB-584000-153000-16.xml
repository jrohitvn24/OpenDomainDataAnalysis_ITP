		<title>16LOCAL HOUSING</title>
		<content>     There is a wide variety of housing
 in the area from medieval timber-     
 framed houses to impressive brick and 
 ragstone Georgian farmhouses, terraced
 Victorian cottages and across the road
 from the school a post-war council    
 estate, a large number of which are   
 owner-occupied. Housing is very       
 expensive in the area with the older  
 houses scattered along the Pilgrim's  
 Way costing Â£100,000 or more and an   
 average family house in the village   
 well in excess of Â£40,000.            
    There is no new building planned in
 the area, a recent project for new    
 homes in the village being opposed by 
 the parish council, and a large number
 of families have lived in the village 
 for many generations. A few families  
 haved moved into the village in recent
 years helping to boost numbers at the 
 school which had been falling rapidly.</content>
