		<content> The caravan site is situated at about 
 a mile out of Cockermouth town centre.
 It has three types of lodgings which  
 are: pine log cabins, huts and        
 caravans.                             
   The site also has a tourist         
 information hut which also sells small
 groceries. This is situated in the    
 centre of the site and is easily      
 accessible. Caravans,which are in rows
 on a field, are the most common type  
 of lodging. There are a few huts and  
 about 20 log cabins spread about the  
 site.                                 
   The site which is in the countryside
 has a stream running through the      
 middle of it and is surrounded by     
 trees.
