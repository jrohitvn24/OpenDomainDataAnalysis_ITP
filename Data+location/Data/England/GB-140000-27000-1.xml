		<title>01The Country West of Penzance</title>
		<content>  This area is covered mainly by small 
 grassy fields of approximately 5 acres
 enclosed by Cornish hedges built of   
 granite stone and earth. The hedges   
 are covered by plants, brambles and   
 bushes giving good coverage for animal
 life. The grass fields are used mainly
 for feeding Guernsey and fresian      
 cattle.A few fields grow Cauliflower. 
 The granite outcrops are rugged and   
 support heathers, bracken and         
 brambmles. The banks of the little    
 river valleys are covered with        
 bracken. This area has numerous       
 standing stones and ancient barrows   
 plus the prehistoric village of Carn  
 Euny. The drift reservoir is fairly   
 new and serves west Cornwall. Small   
 country lanes disect the area but only
 2/12 are seved by a bus route.
