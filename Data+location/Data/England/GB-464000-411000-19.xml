		<content> Most of our block is farming          
 countryside.The farmers conserve      
 nature by laying A-shaped hedges.     
 Almost all of the work is             
 mechanised,this saves time,labour,    
 and money.However a few farmers       
 prefer to live in the past.Most of    
 the farms are owner occupied, few of  
 them employ outside labour.Apart      
 from around Stainforth Pit,the        
 waterways are clean and the fish are  
 healthly.The buildings around the     
 pit suffer from coal dust fall        
 out,and smell.People living within    
 2 miles of the pit can hear machine   
 noises.The roads within Stainforth    
 unfortunately have litter scattered   
 about.There is a lot of wildlife in   
 our block.Most of the land in our     
 block is unpolluted.
