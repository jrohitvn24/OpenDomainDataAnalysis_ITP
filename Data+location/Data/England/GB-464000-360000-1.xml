		<title>01BRIEF OUTLINE</title>
		<content> The area contains 2 Villages, one     
 called Bilsthorpe which is a Mining   
 community with houses, shops, schools,
 some light industry and a large number
 of Clubs and organisations. It is     
 passed to the West by the Nottingham  
 Road and to the south by the Mansfield
 to Newark Road. A Landfill and        
 Landscaping scheme is in progress to  
 the east of the village.              
 Eakring is the other village, it is   
 situated on the top of a hill         
 surrounded by farmland and woodland.  
 The friendly small rural community has
 one shop,a bus service and Clubs      
 catering for most age groups. There   
 are some special conservation factors.
 However, Eakring was the first place  
 in the country where oil was produced,
 British petroleum still have their    
 Main Development base here.
