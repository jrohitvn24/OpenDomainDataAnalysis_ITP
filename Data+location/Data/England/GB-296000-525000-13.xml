		<title>13SWIMMING POOL WORKINGTON</title>
		<content> Next to the sports centre we have the 
 swimming pool which were opened in    
 1971.These however were not the first 
 baths the people of Workington had    
 enjoyed there had previously been some
 public baths behind the site of the   
 old Central Hotel.There are two pools 
 at the complex a large 25m pool and a 
 smaller heated pool for young children
 and non swimmers.From the baths they  
 run a swimming team which competes    
 throughout the county in              
 competitions.The baths also have a    
 drink and snack vending machine as    
 well as a large spectator area by the 
 larger of the two pools.
