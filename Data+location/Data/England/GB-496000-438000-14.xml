		<content> The students of Bishop Burton College 
 of Agriculture, through their Student 
 Union and Rag Committee, organise     
 during the academic year activities   
 and entertainments to raise money for 
 national charities of their choice.   
 The events are concentrated during    
{'Rag Week', usually the first week in 
{May.}There are certain traditional    
 activities;                           
 A{Bed Push}which involves pushing     
 'home-made beds' from the College to  
 Beverley and back, collecting money en
 route.                                
 A{Fun Run}which is a cross-country run
 set within the College grounds. It    
 attempts to keep up an image of fit   
 farmers!
