		<title>18WHAT WE WOULD LIKE</title>
		<content>  In{Hoylandswaine}there are very few  
 places for the people to use. Some of 
 us asked around the{village}to see    
 what people would like. This is what  
 they told us. We would like a chip    
 shop,Newsagents,Grocers,Bakers,Market,
 D.I.Y shop,Butchers,Joke shop and a   
 Tailor.The nearest shopping centre is 
{Penistone}which is three miles away.In
 Hoylandswaine we only have a small    
{village store}and a small{Post Office.
  We would like a{Sports Centre.}In it 
 we would like a swimming pool,a fun   
 pool, ice skating rink,roller skating 
 rink, tenis court,football pitch,     
 gymnasium and an adventure playground.
  The{buses}only run every hour and we 
 would like them more frequently. Our  
 bus stop is only little but we do have
 a bus shelter.
