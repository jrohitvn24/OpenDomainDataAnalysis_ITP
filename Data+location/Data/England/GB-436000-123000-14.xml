		<title>14VILLAGE ASSOC.BRAISHFIELD</title>
		<content> This was started in 1974 to encourage 
 people to take an active interest in  
 parish affairs.When a Gas pressure    
 reducing installation was proposed,the
 B.V.A.organised public meetings,the   
 result being a quiet,well hidden      
 station.Public meetings were also held
 over the scheduled oil drilling.      
 Theidea of a new Village hall and the 
 re-starting of the village flower show
 came from the B.V.A. They sponsored   
 the start of a Scout troop,Cub pack &amp; 
 Senior citizens club.They have        
 provided hard-standing at a bus-stop, 
 pressured for improved safety at a    
 dangerous cross-roads and are         
 improving the village pond.A news-    
 letter is produced bi-monthly, and a  
 booklet of local information is given 
 to all new residents,which gives      
 details of all village organisations.
