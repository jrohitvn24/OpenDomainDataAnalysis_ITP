		<content> The second square in our project is   
 rather unique in the Crawley set up.  
 This particular part of Pound Hill is 
 Unique in as much as the property in  
 this area is entirely made up of      
 privatly owned accommodation,mostly   
 being detatched houses.The average    
 cost of these homes in 1985 is {      
{Â£60,000}considerably higher than other
 areas of Crawley. The street names in 
 this area follow the pattern of themes
 as used in all the Crawley Neighbour  
 hoods.The themes adopted in this area 
 are linked to {University Colleges}e.g
 Oriel Close, Balliol Close, Trinity   
 Close and Pembroke Close.{and Authors}
 KIpling Close, Belloc Close andBurns  
 road.In a survey we discovered that a 
 considerable number of people in this 
 area commuted daily to London to work.
 MOst of the people surveyed had       
 attended some form of higher education</content>
