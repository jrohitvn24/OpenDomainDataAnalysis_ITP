		<title>02EXPLORING TARRANT VALLEY</title>
		<content> We got off the coach at the war       
 monument on the busy A354 Salisbury   
 Road.Then we walked along a footpath  
 to what we thought was a hill but     
 turned out to be a long barrow.We     
 stood on the top from where we could  
 see nearly all of our block.We then   
 walked in the grass and nettles at the
 side of the main road to Tarrant      
 Hinton.We passed lots of fields with  
 crops or grass in them.We left        
 Karl,Matthew and Paul there to do a   
 traffic survey.Then we walked along   
 the Tarrant valley towards the village
 of Tarrant Launceston which was just a
 few buildings and on to Monkton.We    
 interviewed people and explored the   
 villages to find out what we          
 could.Some of the others went to a    
 farm.Then we went back to school.
