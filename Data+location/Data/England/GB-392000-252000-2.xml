		<content> In a normally low rainfall area of    
 (approx.24 inches) the countryside in 
 the summer of 1985 is unusually green 
 and lush due to high rainfall         
 throughout the summer. Although all   
 mature elm trees were destroyed by    
 Dutch Elm Disease in the 1970's new   
 elms are being regenerated in the     
 hedgerows. In recent years some hedges
 were removed to combine small fields  
 making them a more convenient size    
 for large farm implements. The        
 remaining hedges are of mixed species 
 with sycamore, wild rose and          
 quickthorn. A feature of the hedgerows
 in autumn is the rampant growth of Old
 Man's Beard (wild clematis) and       
 blackberries in abundance. Fruit trees
 in the hedgerows - damsons, apples    
 and pears - which are the remains of  
 old orchards, is another feature of   
 the area.                             </content>
