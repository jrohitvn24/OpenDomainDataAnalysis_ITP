		<title>08A Country Park</title>
		<content>    The Country Park has lots of tall  
 trees and big fields where we can     
 play. There are two lakes.  One is a  
 rectangle shape and is dangerous      
 because it is green and looks like    
 grass, so you could easily mistake it 
 for a play area and fall in. The other
 is shaped like a banana and has some  
 ducks swimming on it.  We call it the 
 Banana Lake.  There are lots of wild  
 flowers in the park; in the grounds of
 the Hall there is a miniature train   
 that anyone can go on and a tunnel    
 that you go under.  The Park is good  
 for flying kites and you can play lots
 of games.
