		<title>16FARMS - HARDINGS</title>
		<content>  Hardings farm belongs to a man by the
 name of Mr. David Morris. Hardings is 
 just one part of the farm that Mr.    
 Morris owns. The other parts of his   
 farm aren't in our area. On Hardings  
 is one detached house and one big     
 barn where Mr. Morris keeps his square
 bales of hay and equipment. To get to 
 Hardings you have to go down a rough  
 200 metre track with arable fields    
 each side. Gerry Kew lives there now. 
 He is a local vet, and before him Don 
 Morton lived there-he works on Mr.    
 Morris' farm. Hardings isn't on the   
 mains water supply, but gets its'     
 water from a well with electric pumps 
 which pump water into two or three    
 water tanks in the roof.
