		<content>The original village,comprising the    
oldest houses,is centred around the    
village green.Some of these are over   
three hundred years old.Two modern     
estates have been built at one end of  
the village. One consists mainly of    
private semi-detached bungalows,the    
other is a council estate.There are a  
few infillings of modern houses within 
the main village,eg.three new houses   
by the pub"The Duke of Cumberland."From
our survey the most common dwelling    
place is the detached house,the        
majority having been built after       
1900.Most dwellings have brick walls   
with tiled roofs.The older houses tend 
to use local materials such as flint or
brick and white weatherboarding for the
walls,whilst roofing tiles are of the  
Kent peg variety.
