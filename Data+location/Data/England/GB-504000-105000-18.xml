		<title>18ANGMERING CARNIVAL</title>
		<content> Every year in Angmering, a carnival is
 held with about 6 floats which they   
 hope will be boosted to 10 in 1986.   
                                       
 Some of the floats are entered by     
 children which is very good as most   
 children don't like that sort of      
 thing.                                
 The procession raised Â£40 and towards 
 the end of the procession another Â£100
 was raised.  The best float was won by
 the Lamb Inn with 'LITTLE BO PEEP' and
 St Wilfred's with 'YOU'LL NEVER WALK  
 ALONE'.  Every year at the carnival,  
 the carnival itself gets better with  
 more people volunteering to help.     
 Each year the procession gets bigger  
 and better.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
