		<content>    The Art College is the third of the
 Colleges to be situated on the        
 Aylestone Campus just off Foley Lane. 
    This College offers a wide variety 
 of courses. Diploma Courses in Art and
 Design give students a good general   
 grounding before going on to higher   
 education. The Certificate Courses are
 mainly concerned with providing       
 students with training in a single    
 specialist area prior to employment,  
 such as clothing manufacture,         
 photography, hair dressing and retail 
 display. Combined courses are         
 structured to combine art studies with
 general education. Some GCE subjects  
 offered are not available elsewhere in
 the County. eg Theatre Studies.       
    Jewellry, Ironwork, Ceramics and   
 Graphics are all popular options for  
 students and displays of students'    
 work is a feature of this college.    </content>
