		<title>14THE HOSPITAL</title>
		<content> Farnborough Common Road is a rather   
built-up area dominated by Farnborough 
Hospital.There are also some new houses
ng built.                              
The 261 is a regular bus service,and   
there is also a coach service with the 
numbers 705 and 706.                   
The speed limit is forty miles per     
hour, as it is a main road,it is rather
busy.                                  
outside Farnborough Hospital there is a
pillar box and a telephone box.The     
number of the telephone box is 52025.  
Further along near Crofton Road there  
is a pub called the Olde Whyte Lyon and
Police Station.It is a Metropolitan    
Police Station and is open from 8 am   
until 10 pm.We then turned into Crofton
Road where there are many shops and    
there are also Building Societies and a
Mobil Petrol station.                  
Sainsburys is a newly built supermarket</content>
