		<content> Many people are unemployed. My Dad is 
 employed;he works at a place called   
 'Bardons', teaching people how to make
 ballbearings and making sure they are 
 made properly. My Mum works at home.  
 She knits, crochets and embroiders    
 jumpers. She goes to the shop and gets
 a pattern, then has about a fortnight 
 to make it. Then she takes it back and
 gets money for it. My cousin is 24;he 
 works by delivering food to shops. He 
 drives a big van around and gets a lot
 of money for it. My uncle works in an 
 office and visits people if they have 
 housing problems. He arranges help for
 them. My Auntie works in 'Debenhams'  
 which is a big department store. She  
 gets up early in the morning and gets 
 back late. My Grandad is an artist. He
 draws scenes. He often does craft as  
 well.My sister works at a hairdressers
 on Saturdays and enjoys it very much. </content>
