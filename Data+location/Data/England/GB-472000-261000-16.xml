  Rye Hill is a new estate which       
consists of flats houses and miniature 
parks.The flats have slanted rooves    
which are pointed.The flats are built  
of brick but the rooves are made of    
wood which has been painted over.Some  
houses have gardens.Near the houses are
mini parks, some are large and others  
small.                                 
  In the smaller parks there are       
climbing frames and swings.In the      
bigger ones there is a slide, a        
roundabout and some swings.Some swings 
are made of car tyres.The slides are   
very bumpy and set in tarmac.The       
climbing frames are all different to   
each other.                            
  I like the estate because of its     
peace and quiet.
