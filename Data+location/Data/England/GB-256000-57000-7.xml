		<title>07My uncle's farm in Sparkwell</title>
		<content>   On May the 28th 1985 my Dad and I   
 stayed on my Uncle Michael's farm for 
 two days to help with the silaging.   
   He gets up at 7.a.m.,has his        
 breakfast then goes out on the farm.  
   First of all he milks his 60        
 cows,that takes him until 10.a.m. Then
 he washes the parlour and puts the    
 cows out into the field. Next he      
 drives 4 miles to see his dry cows and
 heifers. When he gets back he moves   
 the fence and goes for dinner.        
   Whilst he has been doing all that   
 his son has fed the calves and cleaned
 the yards. Then he and my Dad started 
 silaging. After lunch uncle helped    
 with the silaging until we stopped for
 tea. Then it was time for my uncle to 
 milk the cows again. He finished them 
 at 9.30.a.m. By the time he has washed
 up it is 10p.m. and the end of a long 
 day.                      Paul Verran.</content>
