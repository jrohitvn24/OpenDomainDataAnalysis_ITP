		<content>  Mr and Mrs Barker own Low Applegarth.
 They own the orchard and the yard at  
 the back of the farmhouse. The rest of
 the land belongs to farmer Mr Atkinson
 of East Applegarth. Mr Barker teaches 
 in the local comprehensive school but 
 enjoys the country. The land is very  
 hilly. They sometimes have a few sheep
 for pleasure. The most they ever had  
 was five. When they have sheep Mrs    
 Barker usually weaves the wool. The   
 lambing season is in the spring.      
  They have one pony which is kept in  
 in winter and out in summer. It is    
 riden by the children.                
  The house is rather old, it is made  
 out of the local stone, which is      
 limestone and sandstone.
