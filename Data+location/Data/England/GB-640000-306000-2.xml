		<title>02Halvergate School</title>
		<content> The present school is fifty years     
 old, thirty one children from         
 Halvergate,                           
 Tunstall and Wickhampton attend from  
 age five to eleven when they transfer 
 to Acle High School.                  
 The Headmaster teaches with one full  
 and one part time teacher and ten     
 hours per week from a welfare/clerical
 assistant.                            
 The school has two indoor toilets,    
 electric storage heaters, a tarmac    
 playground and a grass playing field. 
 Few children go home to dinner, most  
 bring packed lunches although cooked  
 meals for thirteen are delivered from 
 Freethorpe school.                    
 Occasionally the local schools combine
 sharing outings and entertainment.    
 Numbers are declining and the school  
 has joined the recently formed Norfolk
 Rural Schools Federation.             </content>
