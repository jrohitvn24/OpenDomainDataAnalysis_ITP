		<content> Norfolk light and landscape have      
 attracted artists; writers have also  
 been drawn by the villages themselves.
 Historically the marsh and downlands  
 have always been important because    
 while open to invasion from the sea   
 they are, at the same time, capable of
 being defended from strong points. It 
 is this, it is said, which has bred a 
 spirit of independence which keeps    
 unwelcome intruders at arms' length.  
                                       
 The increasing fame of the coastland  
{flora}and{fauna}as well as the natural
 beauty of the landscape are bringing  
 more tourists and campers (no caravan 
 sites are permitted). Usually these   
 are made welcome, sometimes as        
 friends, but it is at Christmas, when 
 the tourists are gone and the harvest 
 is home that the villages really come 
 to life.                              </content>
