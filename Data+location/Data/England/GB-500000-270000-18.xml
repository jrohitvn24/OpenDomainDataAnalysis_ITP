I wake up at 7.30 in the morning, have 
a wash, get dressed, have my breakfast,
clean my teeth  and get ready for      
school. The  bell goes at ten to nine. 
We work at our lessons and our first   
break is at 10.40. Our dinner break is 
at twelve 0'clock then we go outside   
until 1.15. Our next break is at 2.25  
then we go home at 3.30. We start      
school when we are 4 years old and     
carry on until we are 16 years old.    
Then you can either get a job or go to 
college. There are many different kinds
of organisations to belong to including
The Guides, The Cubs and The Brownies. 
Jobs are very scarce and a lot of      
people are out of work. The normal     
working day can be the eight 0'clock   
to five 0'clock. On Saturdays and      
Sundays people have the weekend off    
and families go out together.          </content>
