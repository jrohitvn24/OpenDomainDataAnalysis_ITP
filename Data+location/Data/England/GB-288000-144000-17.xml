		<title>17LIVING IN PORLOCK</title>
		<content>                                       
 My mother in law has lived in Porlock 
 for over 50 years.She used to be cook 
 at Allerford House in the late        
 twenties and married a skilled motor  
 mechanic and chauffeur.for most of    
 their married life they lived in a 3  
 storeyed terraced cottage on Porlock  
 Hill built earlier for Tannery        
 workers.There were few home comforts, 
 no bathroom an outside lavatory and   
 one cold water tap.Water was heated in
 the boiler for washing and baths in a 
 hip bath in front of the living room  
 fire.A bathroom was installed by the  
 landlord about 7 years ago.Now 81 Kate
 finds carrying shopping up the hill   
 hard work.She remembers picking       
 'worts' with her children to sell to  
 provide extras - life on her pension  
 is easier.Her philosophy in life is   
 'good neighbourliness'.               </content>
