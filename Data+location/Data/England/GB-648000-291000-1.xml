 Our area is mostly Oulton Broad.To the
west of our area there is the river    
Waveney.On one side of the river there 
is an Inn called the Waveney.On the    
other side there are farms and marshes.
The marshes are called Petos Marsh and 
Share Marsh.Sprats Water is a nature   
reserve. In the North East end of our  
area is the residential part of Oulton 
Broad.The houses there are large and   
expensive.The railway track runs       
through our area and there is a small  
train station.In the main high street  
there is a small number of shops,mostly
gift shops.There is a main broad  where
speed boat racing takes place.There is 
a hotel in Oulton Broad but most       
holiday makers will live on cruisers.  
There is a park near the broads which  
has a cafe and amusements.
