		<title>09DEVIZES SCHOOL AS IT WAS.</title>
		<content> School life in Devizes at the         
 beginning of the 20th Century,as told 
 by Mr.Ray Smith.                      
 At the age of eight Mr. Smith started 
 school.  His elder sister had been    
 teaching him before this.  Mr.Smith's 
 first school was called Parnella      
 School and it stood on the edge of the
 market place, where the Co_op         
 supermarket is now.                   
 Mr.Smith was taught the Three R's,    
 Geography, History, Art and           
 Singing.  They also had an exercise   
 called 'Back Stick' when they had to  
 walk around with a stick to help their
 posture.  On Thursday, Mr.Smith could 
 look onto the market where he could   
 see livestock being sold and a fire_  
 eater performing tricks.  As Mr. Smith
 lived at Coate he had to walk three   
 miles to school and the same back     
 again each day. {(See also page 10.)} </content>
