		<content> Mullion Comprehensive School was built
 in 1978 to relieve the great number of
 pupils going to Helston. At present,  
 550 pupils between the ages of 11 and 
 16 attend. There are 30 teachers and a
 headmaster. If, at the age of 16, a   
 pupil wishes to continue his academic 
 education, he has to go to Helston    
 School Sixth Form. In the first three 
 years at Mullion pupils study English,
 Maths,Humanities (History,Geography   
 and Religious Education),Science      
 (Physics, Chemistry and Biology),     
 Music,Design (Art,Metalwork,Woodwork, 
 Needlework,Home Economics), Languages 
 (Spanish,French) and Physical         
 Education. At the end of the 3rd year 
 pupils choose the subjects they take. 
 They must take English, Maths and P.E.
 and select two subjects from each of: 
 Science,Humanities,Design/Languages.  
 They take O-levels or CSEs in these.  </content>
