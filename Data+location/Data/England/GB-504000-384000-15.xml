		<title>15The Virginia Estate</title>
		<content>     The{Virginia Estate}was created in
 1981. The Estate has about 130 houses.
 The features are a swimming pool,     
 shop, clubhouse, and a phone booth.   
    The Estate was an RAF camp. The    
 aerodrome was built in 1943. It was a 
 bomber station for a Polish squadron  
 using Lancasters.                     
    At first, when the aerodrome was   
 being built, imitation wooden planes  
 were used to make the enemy think that
 it was an operational aerodrome.      
    After the war the aerodrome was    
 used as a supplies depot for RAF      
 Scampton and the houses were built.   
    For a time the Estate was used by  
 the Army (in 1972) then again by the  
 RAF until 1979. The hangers still     
 remain around the Estate.             
    The houses were sold to a private  
 developer, modernised and then sold to
 individual families in 1981.          </content>
