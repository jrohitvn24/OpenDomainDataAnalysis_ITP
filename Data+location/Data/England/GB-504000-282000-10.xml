 On Friday 24th May 1985 it was May    
Day, and Emma Brown was the May Queen. 
"I had a crown with flowers on it and  
Mrs. Frend crowned me which means she  
put the crown on my head while I sat on
the throne in front of the chapel in   
Latham's Hospital. We did some country 
dancing, first of all we danced the    
Circassian Circle, Buffalo Girls, then 
Buffalo Boys, Lucky Seven, and then    
Bridge of Athlone finishing with I Want
To Be Near You and The Clap Dance      
(a Barnwell dance for every one based  
on the Pat A Cake Polka). Then the     
crowning of the May Queen and then I   
gave out bunches of flowers to the old 
people before we we back to school."
