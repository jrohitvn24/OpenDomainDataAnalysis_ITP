   We visted{Greenhill Lodge}Farm,a 240
 acre farm lying between the Bull's    
 Head and Copt Oak,and run by Mr.Bower,
 a tenant farmer.On the farm there were
 63 cows,300 sheep to shear and 370    
 lambs.                                
   The sheep were either{Romney}or     
 Romney cross but Mr. Bower kept 3     
{Leicester}sheep,1 ram and 2 ewes,     
 because of their "very exceptional"   
 wool.                                 
   All the cows were numbered and were 
 mainly Friesian.If a cow had to be    
 replaced it would cost Mr. Bower at   
 least Â£500 and possibly Â£700.At that  
 price they would only be average      
 animals.The cows were not kept for    
 meat but for their milk yield,and     
 produced 11,000 gallons of milk a     
 year.Near the cow sheds was a large   
 metal structure which held cow cake.  </content>
