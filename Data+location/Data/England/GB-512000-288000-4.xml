		<content>         FOLKSWORTH CHURCH.            
 Folksworth Church has a patron saint  
 called St.Helen.Folksworth Church was 
 built in 1150. It was built of Barnack
 Stone.The Bishop of Ely used to give  
 sermons at Folksworth Church but now  
 we've got a new reverend, Mr.Longfoot.
 Folksworth Church has only got a south
 transcept and that was added to the   
 church in 1300.The church has a bell  
 like most churches.St.Helen was born  
 in Asia Minor in 2055 A.D. and died in
 330A.D.There are also stain glass     
 windows which tell the story of       
 Jesus.In the church there is a font   
 and a pulpit which are not used       
 very often.The roof was falling to    
 pieces and the people in the village  
 raised money to mend it.
