		<title>12Social Concerns in Cronton</title>
		<content>{Social Concerns}It would appear that  
 Cronton has changed vastly in some    
 aspects in recent years. We questioned
 66 households, and some dozen social  
 concerns were expressed time and time 
 again. The following seemed to be the 
 uppermost in peoples minds.           
{Vandalism}Quote:"We don't keep        
 livestock in Cronton anymore, because 
 of the cruelty and damage done by some
 local youths."                        
{Drug abuse,violence}Both that in real 
 life and that shown on the television.
{Pollution,crime}Litter problem, dogs  
 fowling the footpaths and smoking     
 allowed in public places. Chemical    
 smells which drift over Cronton, are  
 they harmful? Chemicals also being    
 transported by road through the       
 village.Could the lack of parental    
 control be responcible for the        
 increase in crime among the young?    </content>
