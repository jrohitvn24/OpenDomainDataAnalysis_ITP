		<content>   The hub of social activity in the   
 village is the{ Hooper Hall},so called
 because when it was erected in 1924   
 the then Rector,Rev.Samuel Fry Hooper 
 provided the bulk of the funds while  
 the village raised the rest and the   
 Squire donated the land.              
   The Hall is now administered by a   
 committee of local people. Here are   
 the events that take place regularily 
 in the Hall.                          
   The{Women's Institute}meet once a   
 month.                                
   Once a fortnight there is a{Whist   
{Drive}in aid of Church and Hall funds.
   Also once a fortnight the{Golden Age
{Club}meet.This is for the over        
 sixties.                              
                                       
   The Hall is also used for Jumble    
 sales,parties and the occasional      
 Disco.                                </content>
