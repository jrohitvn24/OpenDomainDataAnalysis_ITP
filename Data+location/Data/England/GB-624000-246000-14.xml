		<title>14TRANSPORT THROUGH WOODBRIDGE</title>
		<content> We did a transport survey at the      
junction of Ipswich Rd.and Cherry Tree 
Rd.for half an hour.152 cars,4 buses   
and 34 lorries and vans passed. Pedal  
bikes are quite popular in Woodbridge  
because 15 passed us and only 4 motor  
bikes. There were more bikes going     
into Woodbridge than out,but           
strangely,it was the opposite for      
motor vehicles.                        
 At the unmanned British Rail Station  
one train arrived during this half hour
with 4 people for London,3 for Ipswich,
and only 1 for Norwich.                
 One person in the class used a        
timetable to work out how many bus     
journeys passed through Woodbridge in a
year. It is 26,365 (allowing for Bank  
Holidays,occasional services etc.)     
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
