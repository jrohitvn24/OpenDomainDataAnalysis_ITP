		<title>06THATCHAM HOUSE</title>
		<content> Thatcham House is a listed building   
 and a popular landmark within our D   
 Block. It was built for the Vicar, Rev
 Hezekiah in 1866 and was finished in  
 1871. The most famous family who lived
 there were the Turners in 1902 and    
 that's where Turners Drive got its    
 name.  Alexander Buller Turner and his
 brother Victor, both won the Victoria 
 Cross and that's how Alexander Road   
 and Victor Road got their names. The  
 family moved out in 1948 and the      
 house was unoccupied until 1951 when  
 it was modernised and converted into  
 three self-contained flats. Within a  
 few years the house and grounds were  
 acquired by Mr.Zornow who intends to  
 restore Thatcham House and use half   
 the building as offices for his       
 building firm and to lease out the    
 other half. Conversion is still taking
 place.                                </content>
