		<content> IN OUR VILLAGE THERE IS A RIVER CALLED
 THE STOUR AND IT FLOWS RIGHT THROUGH  
 OUR BLOCK. IN PART OF THE RIVER THERE 
 IS A LITTLE ISLAND AND IT BELONGS TO A
 FARMER AND YOU CAN ROW UP THERE IN A  
 SMALL ROWING BOAT BUT YOU WOULD HAVE  
 TO ROW AGAINST THE CURRENT. BEHIND THE
 RIVER THERE IS A FIELD CALLED WALNUT  
 TREE FIELD AND ON THE OTHER SIDE THERE
 IS A FIELD THAT BELONGS TO A FARMER.IN
 SOME PARTS OF THE RIVER IT IS DEEP AND
 IN SOME PARTS IT IS WEEDY AND THE     
 CURRENT IS QUITE STRONG.A LITTLE WAY  
 PAST THE ISLAND IS A BRIDGE CALLED    
 WHITE MILL,IT IS VERY OLD AND IT GOES 
 OVER THE STOUR.THERE ARE FISH IN THE  
 RIVER,TROUT,PIKE, MINNOW,DACE AND     
 PERCH.IF YOU HAVE A SPECIAL LICENCE   
 YOU CAN FISH FROM THE BANK.
