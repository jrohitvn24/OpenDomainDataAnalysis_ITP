		<title>10LEEDSTOWN HUNT</title>
		<content> At the start of the hunt we all met at
 Leedstown Hall. We waited until the   
 Masters in the red jackets thought    
 everyone was there and it was time to 
 go. The Master tooted his horn and off
 we went. We trotted down the road past
 Calloose Caravan Park and turned off  
 left down a bumpy lane which led us to
 a field. The Master sqeezed his horse 
 into a canter and off we went. The    
 wind whistled through our ears as our 
 horses and ponies galloped faster. We 
 went through some rather boggy areas  
 and then we drew to a walk along the  
 edge of a field because it was planted
 with corn. Then a fox ran over a hedge
 and so with a toot of the Master's    
 horn and a "Tally Ho" we were off. As 
 we cantered over fields I wondered if 
 we were going to catch the fox?{He    
{disappeared down a fox hole.}We were  
 all disappointed.                     </content>
