		<content> A voluntary{play school}is held on two
 mornings a week to help children learn
 to play together.                     
 Children go to our  school at 5 years 
 old and stay till aged 11. There are  
 32 children,and part time             
 teacher,clerk and dinner              
 assistants.The school day starts at   
 9.00am and ends at 3.00pm for infants 
 and 3.30 for junior classes.          
   The school is approx. 120years old  
 and still has outside toilets.A new   
 school was planned in recent years but
 never built and there is always some  
 threat of such small village schools  
 being closed for economy.             
   School is a social centre for the   
 village as there is an active PTA and 
 social functions are held as well as a
 carol sevice ,concerts etc.           
   At age 11 children transfer to the  
{secondary schools}in Buxton.          </content>
