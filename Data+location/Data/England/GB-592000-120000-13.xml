		<title>13District Police in Rye</title>
		<content>  We asked the local policeman about   
 our local police station. He told us  
 that there were only one woman and 22 
 men. Also there are four C.I.D.       
 officers who are detectives. They do  
 not have any police dogs or horses.   
 The police station was built 25-30    
 years ago. It is open from 6am to     
 10pm. There are four cells in Rye.    
 There are many more crimes in the     
 summer than the winter because of all 
 the tourists. On average they deal    
 with 30 crimes each week.
