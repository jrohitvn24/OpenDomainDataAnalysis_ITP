		<title>20EARLY CRICKET</title>
		<content> At Easter,1622 George Carleton, the   
 Bishop of Chichester from 1617-1628   
 made each player confess and repent   
 his wrong doings. The Crimes were,    
 playing in the church yard, breaking  
 the church windows with the ball and  
 nearly beating out the brains of a    
 little girl with a cricket bat. The   
 last offence happened because in those
 days the rules allowed  a batsman to  
 hit the ball twice rather like the    
 game 'peggy'  played in Yorkshire.    
 In this case one of the players hit a 
 little girl standing  nearby. The     
 rules of the game were changed in 1647
 after a fatality at Selsey.           
 All the Boxgrove players were found   
 guilty and fined XII d.(12d.) This was
 a lot of money and in addition they   
 lost a days pay by having to walk in  
 to Chichester.  The players ages      
 ranged from 16 to 36.                 </content>
