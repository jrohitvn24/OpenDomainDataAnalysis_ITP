		<title>01THE KNOCK-DUFTON AREA</title>
		<content> A large part of this area is upland   
 falling away towards the Eden Valley  
 in the South-west where there are the 
 two small villages of Knock &amp;         
 Dufton.The buildings are notable,being
 built predominantly of the attractive 
 local red sandstone.                  
 The area of hill,known locally as     
 fell,is drained by several small      
 streams or becks.The farms on the     
 lower slopes have allotments of rough 
 grazing which continue up onto the    
 higher unenclosed fell.               
 It is a scenic area,quiet and remote  
 from any large centre of              
 population.The bare grassy slopes of  
 Dufton Pike,a conical shaped hill on  
 the edge of the fells is the prominent
 feature.The area is a haven for wild- 
 life and geologically interesting.    
 There is an area of mining development
 where old mines are reworked.         </content>
