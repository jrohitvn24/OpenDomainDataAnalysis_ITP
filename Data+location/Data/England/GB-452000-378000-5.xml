		<title>05Drill Rig -Thorpe Salvin</title>
		<content> In April 1985 I was taking the dog for
 a walk and I noticed that they were   
 making a structure at the end of      
{Southards Lane.}The next day I saw    
 it was a drill rig.                   
 We wrote to the coal board to ask     
 for some information about the drill  
 rig. A few days later we got a reply  
 from the{National Coal Board}colliery 
 surveyor. In the letter it says that  
 they were looking for samples of the  
 coal seam in the rock. They make      
 a hole 12.5 cm in diameter and the    
 borehole is 810 m in depth. It was up 
 for one month but now it has been     
 taken down, although machines         
 that were taking samples stayed for   
 some time.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
