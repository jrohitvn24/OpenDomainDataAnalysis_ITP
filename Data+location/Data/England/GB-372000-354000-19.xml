  {Has the village changed during your 
{life?                                 
  When I was a child there were fewer  
 people,no housing estates and field   
 and orchards covered the land. There  
 weren't any motor cars so there were  
 no proper roads. There was no need to 
 lock your door when you went out as   
 you do today.                         
{Did the War affect life in Haslington?
  Not really but some people were      
 conscripted and of course some of them
 lost thir lives.                      
{Do you prefer life in the past?       
  I think that life was better in the  
 past.When I was younger the world     
 seemed to be a better place with less 
 violence and the life was much slower 
 and easier.
