		<title>01The Area Around Beetham</title>
		<content>                                       
 Beetham is a rural area of gently     
 undulating pasture land on the        
 southern fringe of the Lake           
 District.The Bela River is a minor    
 tributary of the River Kent, flowing  
 through the area to the Kent Estuary. 
       The village of Beetham is       
 situated on the A6 and River Bela.The 
 hamlet of Slackhead is a continuation 
 of Beetham village rising westward    
 through native woodland and the       
 limestone pavement of Haverbrack.     
       In Prehistoric Times the whole  
 area was below the sea and some of the
 limestone on which it lies is rich in 
 fossil shells. The site has been      
 occupied since Iron Age Times.        
        The Saxons used the waterfall  
 to work the Cornmill.
