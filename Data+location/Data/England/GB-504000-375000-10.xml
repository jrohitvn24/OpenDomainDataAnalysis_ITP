 and make my bed and do quarter of an

 car and drive to school.We go in to   
 school and do maths and English until

 project work until twelve o'clock.This

 twelve o'clock we have our lunch and  
 play time.At one o'clock we come in

 fifteen when we go home.At home I     
 watch ten minutes of television then I
 go upstairs and play Lego until       
  tea time.After tea I go upstairs     
 and play with my Lego again.Then I    
 have a bath and then go to bed after a
 hard day.                             </content>
