		<content>{UPLAND}More than one third of the     
 block consists of land over 150m. This
 is open country known as{rough fell,  
 consisting of sparse grasses, often   
 invaded by{bracken,}and rocky ground. 
 Rocky outcrops are known as{crags,    
 with fans of broken stone, or{scree,  
 at their base.                        
 The upland is crossed by countless    
 small streams or{becks;}some flow     
 through steep-sided ravines or{ghylls.
                                       
{HIGH PASTURE}The{fell wall}marks the  
 upper limit of enclosed rough grazing.
 Below this are steep fields which have
 been cleared of stone to build        
 boundary{walls.}Some small areas of   
{woodland}are present in the high      
 pasture, particularly in the ghylls,  
 where the trees are inaccessible to   
 grazing animals.
