		<content> The landscape of the area is gently   
undulating,with the Upper Deben Valley 
running through it.Most of the land is 
arable but has water meadows on either 
side of the river.These meadows attract
wild geese,swans &amp; many other water    
birds such as herons &amp; kingfishers.The 
river water is clean &amp; supports a      
variety of fish-fishing is enjoyed as a
sport.Kingcups,watercress,wild hostas, 
irises &amp; other water-loving plants grow
in profusion.During heavy rains the    
river often overflows,covering the     
fields and flooding the roads.         
 There are several small areas of deci-
duous woodland-some coppiced-used gene-
rally for the rearing of gamebirds.As  
well as reared pheasants there are many
wild ones,also partridges,a few        
woodcock &amp; snipe.Birds of prey include 
kestrels,sparrowhawks &amp; occasionally   
peregrine falcons.                     </content>
