		<title>06OVER WYRESDALE: BEEF CATTLE</title>
		<content>    Farms in this area which do not    
 have dairy herds concentrate instead  
 on breeding and rearing beef cattle   
 which, like the sheep, are sent to the
 auction market at Lancaster. The dams 
 are a cross between Herefords and     
 Friesians. Beef sucklers are produced 
 by crossing these dams with Charolais.
 Bulls are kept on some farms but      
 artificial insemination is also used. 
 Farmers aim to have suckler calves    
 born in January as these will be old  
 enough to turn out to grass in April  
 and will not need concentrates. They  
 are usually sold for finishing in     
 October weighing 7-8 cwts and any     
 not up to weight standard are brought 
 inside to feed. On the higher, less   
 sheltered farms calves may not be born
 until April and will be fed inside on 
 hay or silage and concentrates during 
 the autumn prior to Christmas sales.  </content>
