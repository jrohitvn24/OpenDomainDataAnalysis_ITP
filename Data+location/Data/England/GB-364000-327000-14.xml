    On Sports Day four different House 
 Teams have races against each other.  
 The school is divided into the House  
 colours red, yellow, green and blue.  
 There is a mixture of races: bean bag,
 flat, sack, skipping, leap frog and   
 obstacle.Points are awarded to the    
 winners and at the end they are added 
 up and the winning team is presented  
 with a silver Cup.                    
       {FAMILY PICNIC      }           
    This is when we have one enormous  
 picnic with our families out on the   
 school playing fields. The Dinner     
 Ladies make all the food for us. After
 our outdoor lunch the families are    
 entertained by the children who play  
 fun games.The field is set up with    
 lots of activities. We have to clamber
 over bales of straw, carry buckets of 
 water to fill up barrels- it's great! </content>
