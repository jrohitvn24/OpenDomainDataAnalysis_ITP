 The area is mainly in the valley of   
 the River Kennet with adjoining Kennet
 and Avon Canal ,both of which run from
 West to East.It is bordered on the    
 North and South by hills rising to 125
 metres,in which are small woodlands of
 deciduous and coniferous trees.       
 About half of the area consists of    
 seven farms. The rest is occupied by  
 about sixteen large and smaller       
 factories and a Royal Army Ordnance   
 Depot.The rate of house building is   
 dramatic.A primary school and a large 
 comprehensive school,two churches and 
 a cemetery also occpuy the area.      
 Adjoining the river and canal and     
 dividing the area in two is the main  
 London to the West railway line.      
  Futher North is the A4 road going    
 from London to Bath, two B roads also 
 run from North to South.              </content>
