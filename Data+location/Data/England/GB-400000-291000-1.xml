		<content> The twelve square kilometres are in   
 reality two areas: one of high density
 housing, the other of open            
 countryside. The river valley splits  
 the area from north to south and acts 
 as the route for a Motorway (M5)      
 whilst another Motorway (M6) crosses  
 the north of the area.                
 The industrial decline of the area has
 meant the air becoming cleaner and the
 name 'Black Country' being less       
 appropriate. The countryside of the   
 valley provides a wildlife refuge as  
 well as recreational facilities. It is
 a pity that the facilities offered by 
 the valley often cost more than the   
 residents surrounding it can afford to
 pay. People live in their villages    
 even though the villages have joined  
 together to form one conurbation. The 
 optimistic outlook of the residents   
 is natural even if foundationless.    </content>
