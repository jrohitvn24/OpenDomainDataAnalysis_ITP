		<title>16FILMING "REVOLUTION" (1)</title>
		<content>  On 8th May we went to see a film set 
 at Burrator.Thomas Hudson's Dad is the
 director of the film.Mrs.Hudson       
 arranged it so that we could go and   
 see a stuntman and parts of the film  
 being acted.We saw thousands of actors
 We even saw a little boy who was one  
 of the drummer boys.We saw AL Pacino  
 the star of the film.                 
   We watched two men who were supposed
 to be dragging George Washington.Then 
 we talked to George Powell the man who
 makes things out of fibre glass.He    
 made things in Star Wars,James Bond   
 and thousands of other films.         
  After we had got his autograph,we    
 watched the same two men dragging     
 George Washington and a pack of       
 bloodhounds chasing them.The way they 
 got the bloodhounds to go was to get  
 two dead rabbits and drag them along  
 the route.(Continued on page 17)      </content>
