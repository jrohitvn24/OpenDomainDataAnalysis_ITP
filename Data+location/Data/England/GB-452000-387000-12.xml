		<title>12A Typical School Day, 2</title>
		<content> We come back in and start doing some  
 maths or English. At 12.0 o'clock we  
 have our lunch and it is usually a big
 dinner. After lunch we go out to play 
 football as usual. When we come in we 
 might have an assembly or carry on    
 with the same subject, or do something
 else. It might be the Domesday Project
 or art. Sometimes we might work on    
 some science or perhaps movement      
 or music, it all depends on which     
 day it is. After playtime Mr Gilmore  
 might read the " Little Grey Men",    
 which is our class story this term.   
 Sometimes we might just read our books
 or choose what we want to do. At      
 this time of the day Mr. Gilmore      
 mostly works with people listening to 
 them read or doing reading exercises. 
 At the end of the day we put our      
 chairs up and say the Lord's Prayer   
 before going home.                    </content>
