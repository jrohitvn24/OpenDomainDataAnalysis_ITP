		<content> Mexborough, Swinton, Wath and Denaby  
 offer a wide range of facilities for  
 an evenings entertainment locally.    
 There are several public houses       
 especially geared towards the younger 
 generation and its needs including    
 discos and modern music. An excellent 
 example of this is the Towpath at     
 Swinton. Many of the public houses    
 though are engineered to please the   
 older generation wishing for an       
 evenings entertainment in more        
 pleasant and peaceful surroundings. An
 example of this is the Dog Daisy in   
 Mexborough which is a modern building 
 but a place that keeps up all         
 traditions of old.                    
 The Empress at Mexborough is an       
 excellent place to go for the         
 occaissional night out. It is a       
 ballroom but also has facilities for  
 discos pool, snooker and private      </content>
