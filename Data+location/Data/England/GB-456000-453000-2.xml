		<title>02Ouse River Walk : Rawcliffe</title>
		<content> On Thursday 4th July 1985 we went for 
 a walk by the river.We set off from   
 Clifton bridge on to the footpath and 
 by the flood barrier which allows the 
 water from the river to flow on to the
 Ings if there is a danger of flooding.
 On the other bank there were people   
 paddling in the river as it was a hot 
 day. As we walked we saw several      
 people swimming and some fishing.A few
 pleasure boats were going up and down 
 the river too.We saw the sugar beet   
  factory and trains on the railway    
 line on the other side of the river   
 and across the meadows to Rawcliffe   
 and Clifton to the east.A farmer was  
 using a hay tedder to turn over the   
 hay which lay on the ground.We walked 
 for about 2km and stopped for lunch by
 a stone jetty.There was a herd of     
 fresian cows in the field and they    
 came to drink at the river.           </content>
