		<title>03'The Old Mill house'.</title>
		<content> A typical old house of this area. 415 
 years old, carefully renovated by the 
 present owners preserving the original
 building which is made of brick,      
 wattle and daub on a timber frame. The
 upstairs floors are uneven because the
 frame and beams warped over the years,
 it is roofed with original Horsham    
 stone slates.                         
   The timber frame is visible. Inside 
 the house a section of wattle and daub
 was framed and glazed to preserve it. 
 The woodwork has been treated for worm
 and rot, and renewed in places.       
   Piped water, modern sanitation, new 
 kitchen, central heating replace old  
 pumps, earth closets, spit roasting,  
 but open fireplaces are preserved and 
 used. Many similar old Sussex houses  
 have been rescued and modernised to   
 make comfortable homes.
