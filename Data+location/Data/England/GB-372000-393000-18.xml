		<content> Geoff Jones is a professional         
 basketball player. He plays for       
 Manchester United, one of the best    
 basketball teams in the U.K. He lives 
 on Marlborough Road in Flixton. I see 
 him most mornings on the way to       
 school. He walks his black dog as he  
 goes to Dillons to buy his morning    
 paper. Geoff is very tall, about 6    
 feet 6 inches, he has a brown beard,  
 and is slim with broad shoulders. He  
 probably weighs about 11 stone. He    
 drives an F.S.O. car, probably from   
 when he played for Warrington,(F.S.O. 
 were Warrington's sponsors).          
 M.U. are sponsored by Sharp, who make 
 microwave cookers and cassette        
 recorders. Geoff's house is not very  
 big, but looks like it has been       
 modernised. Geoff is on T.V. when his 
 team are playing in a final. Recently 
 they beat Edinbugh in the U-BIX final.</content>
