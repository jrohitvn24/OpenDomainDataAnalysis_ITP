		<content>Springfield Hospital, once a mental    
hospital, is now very enclosed. It used
to have a farm next to it where the    
patients helped feed the animals.It    
has now gone but the patients still do 
their own cooking, etc.A comprehensive 
school for 2000 girls was once a home  
for orphans. Its grounds were once a   
large playing field called Spencer     
Park.The roads are full of noisy       
vehicles.You used to be able to cross  
thd without looking because there were 
no cars as they were very expensive at 
the time.The shops are not really      
suitable for serious shopping.They are 
very small and many of them have been  
shut down.Still open are the David     
Greig greengrocers and butchers.There  
used to be a shoe shop,chemist,three   
banks and a leather shop.Now there are 
just car accessory shops.
