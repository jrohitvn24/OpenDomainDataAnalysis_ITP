		<title>14         SHOPPING</title>
		<content>    There are quite a few shops around 
 the Market Place, West Street and High
 Street. Most of the shops that are    
 empty and sold are turned into Estate 
 Agents or Building Societies. The     
 survey was held during June and 100   
 shoppers were interviewed. 73% of the 
 shoppers lived in Long Sutton. Half of
 the shoppers come by car since parking
 facilities are good. Most shoppers    
 come 2/3 times a week. 76% of the     
 shoppers think that Long Sutton is a  
 good place to shop. But people think  
 there should be a large super market; 
 in fact one is planned. 75% of the    
 people interviewed come to Long       
 Sutton's open-air market.
