		<title>09LOCAL NEWS IN GRAFFHAM</title>
		<content>   I saw a reporter for the Midhurst   
 and Petworth Observer.  It is part of 
 the Portsmouth &amp; Sunderland group to  
 which all local papers belong.  It has
 the most modern colour printing       
 technology in the country.  The       
 stories are telephoned through and put
 onto a computer for editing.  She     
 works at home and reports on local    
 events, features on interesting people
 called 'personality profiles', about  
 their work or hobby.                  
 The information comes from            
 noticeboards around the village, the  
 church magazine, school newsletters   
 and people who telephone her with     
 information.  She says that she plays 
 a very small part in the production of
 the newspaper.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
