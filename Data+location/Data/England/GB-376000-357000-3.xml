		<content>   {A VISIT TO HASSALL GREEN SCHOOL    
 The school was very small. We saw the 
 infants first and then the juniors.   
 There were only 3 girls in the 4th    
 year. The 4th year girls showed us the
 play ground. To get to it from the    
 yard you have to go through a little  
 passage. They had a field as well. It 
 was only a small field but on it they 
 played football and cricket. They had 
 a sand pit and also a climbing frame. 
 We went back inside and did some maths
 in the hall. At 10:40 it was playtime.
 At 11.00 we did english. We had to    
 write a story. When it was 12:00 a    
 bell didn't ring a teacher said       
 "dinnertime!" In the afternoon we did 
 craft and then went for a short walk  
 by the canal. One of the boy's mums   
 led us along. There were only 35      
 children in the school, but it is a   
 very friendly school.                 </content>
