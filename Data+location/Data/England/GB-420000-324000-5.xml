		<title>05A  TYPICAL SUNDAY</title>
		<content>Ring, ring,that's the sound I hear     
every day when the alarm goes off and I
have to get up to go to school.But     
Sundays are different! When I get up I 
have my breakfast of grilled bacon and 
egg with a slice of toast and then I   
get dressed. I put on my jeans, a shirt
and a jumper and then I have a wash and
brush my teeth. The toothpaste is      
lovely and smells like chewing gum.    
After this I go to the shop and spend  
all my pocket money on sweets.At 1.00pm
we have lunch of roast meat , boiled   
vegetables , potatoes and gravy .      
Sometimes I have a glass of wine . If  
we are lucky we have a pudding . After 
lunch I go upstairs and tidy up-after  
all , a room can get in quite a mess in
a week . I have my tea at 5.00pm then I
watch television , have a bath and a   
game of snooker before bed at 9.30pm.
