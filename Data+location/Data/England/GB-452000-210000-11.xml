		<title>11LOCAL AGRICULTURE</title>
		<content>   The countryside consists of open    
 fields, wooded areas, and a steep     
 escarpment. The soil ranges from      
 blowing sand to alluvial gravel,      
 medium loam, sandy and clay silt to   
 heavy Londom clay.                    
  Most farmers are tenants, a few own  
 whole or part of their farms. The     
 landowners are Christchurch and St.   
 John's Colleges, the Church Commission
 and Broadhurst and Buchan Estates.    
  The crops are barley, wheat, oil seed
 rape and agricultural peas. The       
 grassland is used for pasture, silage 
 and hay. The animals are beef cattle, 
 sheep and pigs.                       
  There are 70 acres of horticulture:_ 
 "Pick your own fruit and vegetables". 
 The farms are worked mainly by the    
 farmer and his family using their own 
 tractors and farm machinery.
