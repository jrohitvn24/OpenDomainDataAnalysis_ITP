      {REPORT ON DOMESDAY TRIP         
{                                      
 As we went into our area for study we 
 saw many new houses by Lake which need
 putting on our map.Just before Lake is
 an electricity shed near "Pill Farm"  
 just beside the signpost for          
 Lake.As we passed through the village 
 we could see the tower on top of the  
 hill directly ahead of us.It is now   
 used for clay pigeon shooting.Lake is 
 mostly made up of roughly twelve      
 cottages along the road and a few     
 modern houses.As we came down the hill
 we saw a sign saying 6'6",mile which  
 is a warning of the bridge just before
 the turning for Tawstock School. After
 the bridge we saw the keepers cottage 
 worthy of a mention in future         
 references.
