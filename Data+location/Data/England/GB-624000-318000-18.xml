		<title>18Bureside Youth Club</title>
		<content> An open meeting will take place on    
 Wednesday Sept. 11th in the Tithe Barn
 Horstead, to discuss the possibility  
 of re-opening the Youth Club. It is   
 hoped that many interested people will
 attend, and that these would include  
 young people, parents and other       
 interested adults. The Chairman of    
 this meeting will be Les Gosling, who 
 is our Divisional Youth and Community 
 Officer from whom we can expect       
 practical help and support.           
   Items on the agenda will include;   
      1. Night of Youth Club meeting   
      2. Age range of Club             
      3. Adequate staffing arrangements
  There will be a display of           
 photographs and leaflets relating to  
 Youth Club activities in the area.    
  With the breakdown of public         
 transport it is important that we have
 facilities for our young people.      </content>
