		<title>18EID DAY 1985   BLACKBURN</title>
		<content>I couldn't sleep on Wednesday night.I  
was so excited about Eid the next day. 
My mum woke me early, I washed and got 
dressed in my new clothes. On Eid we   
have a special kind of warm milk with  
Almonds and other crushed nuts in it.  
At nine-o-clock we went to a special   
Eid Namaz. A Namaz is when we go to    
the Mosque and pray with a man who     
speaks in Arabic, he uses a microphone.
The Namaz usually lasts about one hour.
                                       
                                       
During Eid we greet people and shake   
hands, we say EID MUBARAK.We also give 
money to each other and visit our      
friends homes.We offer food and drink. 
We also visit the graveyard to pray for
people who are dead.We celebrate Eid   
because it is the end of the fast of   
Ramadan.We eat rice,on Eid,for our     
dinner.   by Asian boy age 10.         </content>
