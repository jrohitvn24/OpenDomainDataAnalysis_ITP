 STANTON ON HINE HEATH                 
 Stanton is a quiet rural village which
 comprises a variety of residential    
 properties. The main land use in the  
 area is farming, mainly arable with   
 some cattle rearing. The area         
 incorporates some woodland, scrubland 
 and heathland.  Stanton probably      
 derives its name from the latin       
 meaning stoney estate and infact the  
 land is quite stoney and about class  
 two and three for soil goodness.      
 Despite  the lack of many recognized  
 facilities, infrequent bus service in 
 parts of the area for example, most   
 inhabitants seem happy with their area
 and only a few would wish any changes.
