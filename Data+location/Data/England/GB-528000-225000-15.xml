		<content> Centre of organised sport is Walkern  
 sports &amp; recreation club built by     
 volunteer labour with funds mainly    
 raised locally. Main users are cricket
 football, tug of war &amp; clay pigeon    
 shooting clubs. Ardeley also has a    
 successful cricket club which has been
 in existance for 65yrs but is now at  
 risk as the local riding stable, which
 owns the land, wants it for grazing   
 their horses. Horse riding is a very  
 popular sport, with farmers &amp; their   
 families &amp; some newcomers who regard  
 it as part of the life of a 'country  
 gentleman'. This also applies to      
 shooting &amp; there is a sydicated       
 pheasant shoot in the area. There is  
 some attempt to encourage comunity    
 participation through the annual inter
 village sports competition. For other 
 sports eg tennis &amp; swimming people    
 look to Stevenage or further afield.  </content>
