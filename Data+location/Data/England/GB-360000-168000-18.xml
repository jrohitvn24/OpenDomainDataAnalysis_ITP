		<content> Some have families who visit them, or 
 some may go home for the day. Others  
 may need to visit the day hospitals.  
 Once a week residents go to the       
{Bristol 600 club,}where they do craft.
 The residents receive Â£10.00 a week   
 from the social services. However if a
 person has over Â£3000 they use their  
 own money.                            
 Old people can be difficult. Some have
 no memory at all. Miss Rennolds lived 
 in Bedminster with her sister. She    
 does not like the home and would      
 prefer her independance. She came to  
 the home because her sister was no    
 longer able to cope with her. Some    
 times she gets confused and talks to  
 her sister when she is not actually   
 there. Mr Robbins is 102 yrs.old. He  
 worked for British Aerospace. He      
 sometimes loses his way around the    
 home, but he is, like others, happy.  </content>
