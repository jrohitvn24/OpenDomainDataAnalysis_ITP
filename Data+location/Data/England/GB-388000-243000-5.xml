{Chaitanya College.}It became too      
 expensive to run and in{1985}they sold
 it for Â£750,000.It was bought by the  
{Cosima Holdings Co.}who ran a private 
{Manpower Services Commision}training  
 establishment.                        
  This failed and now the court is to  
 be used for a variety of functions    
 including public restaurant, short    
 residential courses, golf and hire for
 private parties.                      
  The building is still of great       
 architectural interest,   although    
 some interiors have been sold to the  
{Metropolitan Museum, New  York}and the
{Victoria and Albert Museum, London.   
  Of the  original estate only{38}acres
 remains attached to the court.
