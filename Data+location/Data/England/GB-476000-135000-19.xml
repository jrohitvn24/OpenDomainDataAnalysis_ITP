		<title>19A BORDON FIREMAN</title>
		<content>   My dad is a fireman at Bordon. He   
 has to work shifts of two days eight  
 until six and two nights of six until 
 eight then he gets four full days off 
 in which he likes  to go shooting. At 
 seven he showers, has breakfast and   
 starts off on another working day. He 
 drives to the station   collecting his
 daily paper from the newsagents.      
   When he arrives,he signs in and     
 checks what part of the crew he will  
 be that shift (driver etc). Then he   
 starts checking equipment so that they
 are ready for emergency.Anything      
 missing is recorded in an "occurence" 
 book and to the watch keeper. Then    
 comes theory and practical drills.    
    After lunch the station has to be  
 cleaned from top to bottom. Then the  
 crew change over and he goes home for 
 tea. After watching the news he is    
 ready to work in his garage.          </content>
