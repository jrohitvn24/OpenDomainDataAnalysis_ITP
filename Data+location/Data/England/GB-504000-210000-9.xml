		<title>09Gaddesden Row: Changes</title>
		<content> Most people work outside Gaddesden    
 Row. Of 20 families at school, 8 work 
 with vehicles, 1 teaching, 2 building,
 1 electronics, 5 agriculture, 3       
 computers.{Cottages}have been knocked 
 together and houses are now expensive.
 The{Council houses}at Jockey's End are
 being sold to the people in them.     
 About twelve new houses are to be     
 built. Fewer people live in rented    
 houses. A{community shop}is opening in
 the Village hall to replace the old   
 Post Office and shop which closed     
 years ago. More planes fly overhead as
{Luton airport}expands. There are fewer
 farm workers needed. There are no     
 longer any sheep, pigs, or poultry on 
 Halsey estate. The fields grow mainly 
 winter wheat and brilliant yellow     
 rape. There are many babies in the    
 Parish and the{school numbers}will    
 stay at 30, or increase.              </content>
