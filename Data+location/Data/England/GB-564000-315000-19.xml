		<content>  Extracts from a diary by Lucy Carter 
 aged 14 of North Runcton.             
 "I woke up at 8.00 a.m. and read my   
 magazine for half an hour.            
 ... I dressed in a pair of bleached   
 jeans, a grey shirt, a grey jumper,   
 and a grey necklace.... I put my make 
 up on then made my bed.               
 ... I ate breakfast, rice krispies and
 orange juice.... then went to get some
{pocket money}from my dad. I get eight 
 times my age.                         
 .... My mum drove me and my friend,   
 Kerry, to town. We spent the morning  
 in Kings Lynn shopping and walking    
 around and meeting our friends. In the
 afternoon we went to the{cinema.}When 
 it was finished I phoned my mum so she
 could come and pick us up.            
 ... When I got home at 6.10 I got     
 myself a drink and a piece of toast   
 and then watched{T.V.}"               </content>
