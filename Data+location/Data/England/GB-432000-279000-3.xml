 Transport in the  area is provided by 
 a Bus Service.  There  are Taxi       
 Services and several  large central   
 car Parks.  A new Bus Station is being
 built in Cox St near to the main bus  
 station at Pool Meadow.  The landscape
 is urban with many modern buildings.  
 But the landmark of Coventry, the     
 Three Spires, can still be seen as can
 also the chimneys of Courtaulds       
 Factory in Foleshill, just behind     
 Cash's Factory which is famous for    
 woven silk work.  Representatives from
 Trade, Industry and Ethnic Groups take
 part inthe annual event of the        
 Coventry Carnival.  The unselfish act 
 of Lady Godiva of Coventry legend is  
 remembered every year as her horseback
 ride through the city is re-enacted   
 in the procession.
