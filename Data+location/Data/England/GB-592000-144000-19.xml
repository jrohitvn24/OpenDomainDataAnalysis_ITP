		<title>19A DAY IN THE LIFE OF...</title>
		<content> My name is Charlotte Hardy and I am 7 
 years old. I live with my mother,     
 father and younger brother at Charing.
 I get up at 7 o'clock and my day      
 starts with me feeding my dog.        
 School starts at 9 o'clock and the    
 first playtime is at 10.35 until      
 10.55. I like to play skipping with my
 friends then. Lunch time is 12 o'clock
 until 1.15 and I take sandwiches to   
 school instead of having school       
 dinner. My favourite sandwiches are   
 Marmite. The afternoon at school is   
 usually art or games or topic work. We
 have another playtime for 15 mins. and
 hometime is at 3.30. When I get home I
 like to watch television, my favourite
 programmes are Batfink and Supergran. 
 Daddy comes home about 5 o'clock and  
 we have dinner. After dinner I have a 
 bath and then read a story before bed.
