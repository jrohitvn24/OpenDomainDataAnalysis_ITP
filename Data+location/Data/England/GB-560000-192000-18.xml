		<content>  Two changes external to the area are 
 having a big impact. The{M.25}is      
 providing quicker{access}to many parts
 of the country, for this area was     
 previously{badly served by motorway. }
 The choice of{Stansted}as London's    
 Third Airport will give an            
{international airport}within{20 }     
{minutes}journey but may increase{noise
 pollution 16-fold. However, both the  
 M.25 and Stansted are expected to     
{raise house prices}here.              
  We asked a sample of Shoppers and    
 Shopkeepers the following question:   
 Are you in favour of Sunday opening of
 shops in this area?                   
  80% of those asked were found to be  
 against Sunday opening.
