		<content> The block is situated on the Chiltern 
 Hills, convenient to the M40 motorway 
 and consists of approximately half    
 mixed deciduous woodland with beech   
 predominating and half arable         
 farmland.  In the north-west is the   
 village of Lane End which is primarily
 residential but has some light        
 industry and two management/conference
 centres.  Residential development has 
 taken place recently at Lane End and  
 at Booker in the north-east which is  
 now effectively a suburb of High      
 Wycombe.  At Wycombe Air Park, Booker,
 club and glider flying takes place,   
 giving rise to some noise complaints  
 from local residents.  Alongside the  
 airfield is a garden centre and a     
 small residential area which used to  
 be RAF married quarters.
