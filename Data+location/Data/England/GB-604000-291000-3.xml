		<title>03A DAY OUT WITH MY FAMILY</title>
		<content> We got up early on a Sunday morning   
 ready to leave to go to the           
 Peterborough Truck Festival.  When we 
 left it was about 8 o'clock and we got
 there between ten and half-past.  When
 we got there the weather was fine but 
 after about twenty minutes it started 
 raining.  There were lots of the big  
 American trucks that had been         
 customized, e.g. dralon furnishings,  
 television, cocktail bars, stereo     
 hi-fi's etc.  Geoff Capes, Noel       
 Edmunds and Barry Sheen were there but
 I didn't see them.  In some of the    
 lorries you were allowed to look      
 inside - I saw some of them but there 
 were so many people you couldn't get  
 to them.  There was a big fun-fair and
 I went on that.  We had rolls, crisps 
 and cakes in the car, then went back  
 and by that time the rain had died    
 down.                                 </content>
