		<content> South Brook flows from West to East   
 of Block through Wilden village -an   
 area offering a natural habitat. In   
 order for the brook to "live," it is  
 important it doesn't become           
 overgrown.The planting of trees in the
 close proximity of the water is       
 avoided. Observations show that the   
 stretches of the brook which have most
 wild flowers are those open to the    
 sunlight. The same principles apply to
 conserving the small natural ponds    
 which exist in the area. Those which  
 were visited sadly showed signs of    
 neglect, although attempts are being  
 made at the Old Rectory pond to       
 improve the light and encourage new   
 growth and wildlife. The pond opposite
 the Victoria Arms offers enormous     
 potential to the visual amenity of    
 this part of the village.
