		<content>{My Life at Home}                      
 My Mum does her weekly{shopping}at a  
 Henley super-market.Every now and then
 we go to Department stores in Reading.
 I do not like going shopping with the 
 family because my Mum always goes off 
 leaving my Dad and I to search for her
 and my sisters.I sometimes wonder why 
 we ever go as I sometimes find it a   
 bit of a drag but when I get something
 nice I reckon it is worth the bother. 
 I like my Mum's{cooking}and most of my
 Dad's.I like his scrambled eggs.My Mum
 does lunches and for Sunday lunch Dad 
 prepares the potatoes and Mum cooks a 
 joint of meat and vegetables.We also  
 have a supper during the week such as 
 beefburgers,fish,potatoes,chips,peas. 
 Mum{washes clothes}in a machine and   
 dries them on a line hung outside.She 
 does all the ironing.For{washing up}we
 have a machine,we dry the pots &amp; pans.</content>
