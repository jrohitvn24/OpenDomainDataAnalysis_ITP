		<title>13S.CROYDON _ SANDERSTEAD</title>
		<content> Sanderstead is a quiet residential    
 area containing a majority of detached
 houses.Until about a century          
 ago,Sanderstead was mostly woods and  
 fields, and there are still scenic    
 areas such as Croham Hurst,Purley     
 Beeches and the Gruffy.Many wild      
 animals are to be found in Croham     
 Hurst, such foxes, badgers,squirrels  
 rabbits and common woodland birds.The 
 same could be said of Purley Beeches  
 which also contains tennis courts and 
 a large playing field.On the Gruffy   
 there is a pond into which many       
 passers by throw their litter.Once a  
 year the scouts clear it out.The cubs 
 and scouts have an annual Gruffy Fair 
 which has many stalls and an "It's a  
 Knockout" competition.In 1984 Â£2500   
 was raised.
