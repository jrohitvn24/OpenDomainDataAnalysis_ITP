		<title>09Industry. Cudworth's Mill</title>
		<content> The mill is at least 200 years old. It
 is situated at the northern limits of 
 the area and makes cotton fustian     
 cloth for corduroy material, which is 
 made into jackets and hats, and       
 moleskin material, which is made into 
 trousers. Walkers like this very much 
 as it is warm and so tough that       
 brambles and thorns will not go       
 through to scratch legs. There are    
 many looms in the weaving shed, not   
 all of them are in use. It is very,   
 very noisy. the fustian cloth is sent 
 down the road to another mill to be   
 'finished'. The looms used to be      
 powered by a steam engine called      
 'Mary' but are now driven by          
 electricity. The mill is also called  
 Baitings Mill. One meaning of         
 'Baitings' is 'resting place'. It is  
 where packhorses used to rest on their
 journey.                              </content>
