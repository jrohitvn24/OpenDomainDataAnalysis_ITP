		<content>   Weeley has a reasonable number of   
 facilities for the people living      
 there.                                
   Weeley bakery makes all of its own  
 bread.  It takes 3 to 4 hours each    
 morning to make all the bread.        
   Half way up The Street, opposite the
 Police Station, is an old bus stop. It
 was erected in 1951 and has the       
 inscription "Rest Ye Awhile, Then     
 Carry On".                            
   There is a 30 mile an hour (MPH)    
 speed limit in The Street which the   
 residents like, but they say that not 
 every driver obeys this rule.         
   Most people that we talked to said  
 that they liked Weeley as a small     
 village and would not like to see     
 development in the area.              
   The shopkeepers especially did not  
 like the new Â£1 coin, because it is   
 too much like the 5p in shape.        </content>
