		<content>  The information about the villages of
 Middleton and North Runcton in West   
 Norfolk was collected by pupils of    
 form 1W2 at{Springwood High School,   
 Kings Lynn during July l985.          
  It has been edited by the pupils with
 the help of their teachers and finally
 put together by the teachers.         
  We would like to thank the many      
 people in{North Runcton}and{Middleton 
 who gave their time to talk to us and 
 who made us so welcome in their homes.
 Without their help this survey could  
 not have been made.
