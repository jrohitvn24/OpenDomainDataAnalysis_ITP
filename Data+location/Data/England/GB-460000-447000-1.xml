		<title>01FULFORD introduction</title>
		<content>   Fulford, as it is known today, is a 
 result of the amalgamation of two old 
 villages, Gate Fulford and Water      
 Fulford, themselves medieval centres  
 of settlement focused on manors of the
 same names.                           
   During the 18th and 19th centuries  
 Fulford was a thriving village. It    
 boasted its own school, St. Oswald's  
 Parish School, founded in 1771 by John
 Key, the then lord of the manor of    
 Water Fulford.                        
   But as the 20th century raced on the
 importance of Fulford as a village    
 declined and its function as a        
 residential centre increased.         
   Now Fulford has lost its identity as
 a village, being enveloped by the     
 residential growth of York.
