		<content>  The science and technology of the    
area  revolves around the High         
School.The first computer was          
introduced in 1982 and in 1985 a       
specialist computer room was built     
with a network of fifteen computers,to 
meet the growing demand. The school    
has courses from C.S.E.to "O" level    
and the more specialised "A"           
level.According to the Joint           
Matriculation Board their syllabus     
aims to create in pupils "an awareness 
of the impact of computers on society  
and of their role in commerce,         
industry and management." Other        
departments within the school, such as 
History, also use the computers to aid 
teaching.A night school class of       
micro- computers for beginners is      
mostly attended by the older           
generation who feel "out of touch"     
with today's society.                  </content>
