 GAZETEER, North East Leeds            
 Harehills  and Roundhay. The work     
 shows a marked discrepancy in land    
 cover between its Northern and        
 Southern sections.  The southern      
 section is overwhelmingly composed of 
 terraced houses, back to back or      
 through-type, and mainly caters for   
 working class people.  This is        
 reflected in the nature of the shops  
 which serve the area, over 90 in a 4  
 sq km block. The northern section is  
 71% open land, recreational and       
 farming.  The largest park in the     
 city is Roundhay Park,  within the    
 most northerly 4 sq kms.  The housing 
 is  mainly large substantial character
 villas, detached and semi detached.   
 The park is the venue for many        
 sporting or social events.
