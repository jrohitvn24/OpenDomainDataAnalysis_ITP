		<title>02THE VILLAGE SCHOOL HENFIELD</title>
		<content>   Originally there were three schools 
 in Henfield, a Boys', a Girls' and an 
 Infants'. The Girls' School is now    
 a house with the old school bell      
 outside. The Infant School is now used
 by the Youth Club. It is next to the  
 Old Workhouse which are now homes. The
 Boys'School which is on the Common,   
 was used up to l983 when the present  
 school site at Fabians Way was        
 completed and the Common School was   
 closed. It is now being converted into
 three houses.                         
   Our school was built in different   
 stages.  There are twelve classrooms  
 and a Hall. Two classrooms are on the 
 second storey and there is a view of  
 the farmlands and Cowfold Monastery.  
 There is a field for games,a large    
 asphalt playground and best of all    
 a covered heated swimming pool.
