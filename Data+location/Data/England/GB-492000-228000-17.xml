		<title>17FOOD: Breakfasts</title>
		<content> A recent survey has shown that nearly 
 half the population goes without a    
 proper breakfast in the mornings.  Not
 many families today have the origional
 English breakfast of bacon, egg,      
 sausage and tomatoe.                  
                                       
 Many just have a bowl of cereal such  
 as Shreddies, Weatabix or cornflakes. 
 A large number of people also have    
 toast.                                
                                       
 To drink, people usually have tea,    
 coffee or pure fresh orange juice.    
                                       
 Some people have porridge or instant  
 cereal which swells out when milk is  
 added.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
