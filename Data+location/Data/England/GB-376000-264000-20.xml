		<title>20SCHOOL ANECDOTES</title>
		<content>  Mr. Wilcox delighted the children    
 with reminiscences of his school days.
 He was often to be found when mischief
 was afoot and he recalled the time    
 when he was punished for shooting his 
 catapult in the classroom. When later 
 in the week he was asked to burn the  
 rubbish, he retrieved his catapult    
 from the basket and hid it in a tree, 
 to be recovered when the headmaster   
 was on holiday. On another occasion he
 was sent to the garage to buy a set of
 plugs for the headmaster's car. The   
 local garage could not supply them and
 so he was sent on his bicycle to the  
 garage at Great Witley.Failing again  
 to obtain the plugs,the headmaster    
 sent him on the bus to Worcester to   
 buy them.He bought the plugs,and while
 waiting for the bus to go home he ate 
 thirteen Chelsea buns by the riverside
 And all this happened in school time! </content>
