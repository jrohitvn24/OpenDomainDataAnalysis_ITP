		<title>16Chipping Sodbury Quarry.</title>
		<content> Chipping Sodbury Quarry has made a big
 difference to the landscape in  the   
 western part of our square.It occupies
 a total area of about 2 square        
 kilometers.The present quarry owners  
 are the Amey Roadstone company (ARC)  
 and the rock quarried is limestone    
 which is used for road building and is
 also made into concrete pipes.Blasting
 at the Quarry can be expected to take 
 place 3 times a day.The blasting noise
 can be clearly heard up to two miles  
 and there are some environmental      
 problems caused by the dust from the  
 quarry and the heaps of stones and    
 rock which can be seen from a         
 distance. The quarry also generates a 
 lot of heavy traffic with lorries     
 making frequent journeys to and from  
 the quarry.The quarry is one of the   
 major employers of the Yate area.
