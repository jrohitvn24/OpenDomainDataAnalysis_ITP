		<title>11Visiting the Police Station</title>
		<content>   On 5th June 1985 we visited the {   
{Ridgeway Police Station}with {Mr      
{Bustin }the Community Policeman. We   
 were taken through a court to reach   
 the cells. The girls were locked in   
 one cell and the boys in the other.   
 There were peculiar smells in the air.
 The windows were smashed and there was
 writing on the walls and the radiator.
 The beds were very hard and covered   
 with itchy blankets. In the corner was
 a toilet with a wooden seat. We       
 thought it was unhygenic and          
 disgusting.                           
   We visited the court and pretended  
 to be the court members. Our finger   
 prints were taken in the inteview     
 room, and we were allowed to keep them
 as a souvenir.
