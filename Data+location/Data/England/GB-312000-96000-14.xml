		<title>14THE PARISH COUNCIL G STARR</title>
		<content> The parish council consists of seven  
 members representing the 190 electors 
 and is elected every 4 years. It is   
 unusual for there to be more than     
 seven nominations for the seven       
 vacancies, and so parish elections are
 raely necessary. As the cost of such  
 elections has to be born by the       
 parish, the holding of an election is 
 not welcomed by the electors. Meetings
 are held as business requires and     
 average 4 or 5 a year. Business dealt 
 with has included obtaining grants for
 the improvement of the parish hall and
 for additional equipment in the       
 childrens playground. All planning    
 applications for development in the   
 parish are considered by the council  
 whose aim has been to maintain the    
 rural character and natural beauty of 
 the area while at the same time       
 providing additional amenities.       </content>
