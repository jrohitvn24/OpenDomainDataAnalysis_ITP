		<content>      Being urban, the area is well    
 served by community organisations. The
 L.E.A. policy is to change schools to 
 dual purpose buildings (school by day 
 &amp; community centre in the evenings)   
 but there are also a number of purpose
 built community centres in the area   
 which can be used throughout the day  
 as well as church halls.              
      The Braunstone Community Centre  
 is used for playgroups, senior citizen
 meetings, a youth club, 'Pop mobility'
 and indoor sports. The Southfields    
 Drive Community Centre has a similar  
 prospectus and serves the Saffron Lane
 Estate. The Rowley Fields School and  
 Community Centre has many evening     
 meetings (including Adult Education)  
 and runs a summer playscheme. Although
 the other large schools in the area   
 are not Community Centres they do     
 provide Adult Education facilities.   </content>
