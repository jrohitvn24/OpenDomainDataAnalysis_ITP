   One of the more unusual industry in 
 our area is a small brewery which was 
 started up about five years ago by a  
 married couple  in some farm          
 buildings. This year they have bought 
 their first public house at Elsted.   
    Their assistant earns about Â£400   
 a month making the three and a half   
 brews a week. There is one other      
 worker besides the boss who drives the
 beer out to the 44 public houses which
 buy it. Called Ballards Beer it has a 
 slightly bitter flavour but the worker
 liked it for he drinks a pint a day.  
 As he has worked there for several    
 years he no longer notices the strong 
 smell or worries when it spills on the
 floor which was once the cow shed and 
 still has a dung channel.
