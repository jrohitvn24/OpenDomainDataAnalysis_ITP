		<title>10St Rumbold's Well</title>
		<content>                                       
    King's Sutton had a spring which   
 became famous as a spa.   That is a   
 place where people met and drank the  
 good water.   The water in King's     
 Sutton was high in magnesium which was
 good for healing.   The water does not
 look very healthy now.                
    By the road to Charlton you can    
 still see St Rumbold's Well but it    
 would not be used for drinking        
 any more because the water is all     
 orange and has lumps of flaky stuff in
 it.   I think it would make you ill   
 rather than better.                   
    Quite a few people came to King's  
 Sutton at one time to drink the water,
 but Bath, Cheltenham and Leamington   
 soon became more popular.
