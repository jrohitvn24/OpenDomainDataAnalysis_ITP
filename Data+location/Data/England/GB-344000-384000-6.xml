		<content>      St Mary's church is the newest   
 church in Halewood and it is Church of
 England and Methodist. The original   
 church was built in 1967 but this was 
 destroyed by fire. The present church 
 was built in 1974.                    
      There are two Ministers, one for 
 each denomination, plus a number of   
 other helpers who help run the church 
 in many different ways.               
      As well as the usual religious   
 services every Sunday there are many  
 other activities that go on within the
 church buildings. These activities    
 include scouts, guides, a playgroup, a
 dance group, a Bible study group and a
 blind persons club.                   
      The church has strong links with 
 the other churches in Halewood and    
 there are quite often joint services  
 held in St Mary's.
