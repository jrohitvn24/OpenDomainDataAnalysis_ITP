		<title>03PINES CAFE, BROOMFIELD</title>
		<content> The owner enjoys running the Pines    
 cafe and restaurant with the help of  
 three other women. The premises have  
 been a place of eating for about 50   
 years; the present owner has been     
 running it for seven. She gets most of
 her customers in the summer at        
 weekends, especially Sundays when she 
 may get up to 300 customers. In the   
 winter she may get as few as two      
 customers. Many older people out for a
 country drive call in.                
 She thinks she does better in the     
 hills than she would down in the      
 village of Kingston St.Mary because   
 she gets a lot of walkers, cyclists   
 and coach parties. They open at 10.30 
 and close about 6 p.m. The gift shop  
 next door is leased by the cafe       
 owner.The gifts sold are not made     
 locally.                              
                                       </content>
