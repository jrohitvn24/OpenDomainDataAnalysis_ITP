		<content>{Brightwell and Sotwell} are two       
villages that have  joined together.   
Nearby are the houses of Mackney. The  
village is near the Town Of            
Wallingford and lies in the Thames     
valley. Until the early   1970's the   
village was in the Royal County of     
Berkshire, but after the local         
reorganisation joined Oxfordshire.     
Oxford City is about 15 miles away.    
Brightwell cum Sotwell is a very busy  
village with a wide range of activities
for people to take part in, ranging    
from Cubs and Brownies to the          
Evergreens for the older folk.         
There are two shops, two   garages, a  
pub, fruit farms, farms, a   furniture 
builder and the world famous           
Bach Centre for flower medicine.       
Nearby Didcot Station with its fast 125
trains to London, makes it a popular   
commuter village.                      </content>
