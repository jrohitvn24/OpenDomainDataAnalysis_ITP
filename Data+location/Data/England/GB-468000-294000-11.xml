		<content>{TYPE OF FARMING AND FARMLAND contd.   
 Much ground has been levelled and     
 hedges removed to allow easier        
 ploughing, and electric fences are    
 often used to prevent livestock from  
 straying.                             
                                       
{FARM MANAGEMENT                       
   There is a lot of planning and      
 office work to do in modern, efficient
 farming. Mr. Stopps, a local farmer,  
 believes that the entry into the      
 Common Market was a dramatic change   
 for the better. Wall maps show the    
 types of crop in every field of his   
 1900 acres, worked by his staff of    
 ten, his three sons and a farm        
 manager, with the help of lots of     
 different farm machinery.             
   Milking is a very complicated       
 business with a lot of expensive dairy
 cattle and milking machinery.         </content>
