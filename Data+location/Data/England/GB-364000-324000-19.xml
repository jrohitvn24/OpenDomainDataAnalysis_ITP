		<title>19My nanny</title>
		<content> My nan lives alone with a cat for     
 company. On sunday mornings she goes  
 to church and in the afternoon my     
 uncle trever comes to do the garden   
 for her. She is a member of the       
 Jubilee club for older people who meet
 on the third tuesday afternoon in each
 month. Sometimes they have a bring and
 buy for funds or go out on  trip. She 
 does all her shopping in Newport once 
 a week as there ins't a village shop  
 in Childs Ercall, although there is a 
 post office for collecting her        
 pension. She is also a member of the  
 mother's union who meet on a thursday 
 afternoon once a month in the         
 vicarage. They occasionally go to     
 other local mother union meetings or  
 church services. She cleans the church
 brasses once aweek or once a fortnight
 depending on how damp the atmosphere  
 is.                                   </content>
