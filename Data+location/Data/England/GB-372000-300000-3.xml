		<content>{Crops.  }The arable crops were on the 
 flatter land, but the permanent grass 
 was mainly in the brook and river     
 valleys.                              
   When the farmers grow their crops,  
 they plant beet, wheat then potatoes. 
 When they have a field of grass for   
 mowing they call it a ley.            
 They keep this for three or four years
 for silage or hay, then plough it up  
 again, spreading farmyard manure      
 before planting potatoes on it.       
   In the summer they cut the grass,   
 put it in the silage pit, then cover  
 it with a black  polythene sheet  with
 tyres to hold it on.                  
   The grass for hay is cut before it  
 goes to seed, is left to dry, then is 
 turned, baled  and stored in barns.   
 We saw round and rectangular bales.   
 In winter the silage and hay are fed  
 to the animals.                       </content>
