		<content>   On the borders of Warwickshire,     
 Leicestershire and Northamptonshire,  
 to the east of Rugby,lie the villages 
 of Clifton,Newton and Catthorpe.      
   Set in mainly agricultural land all 
 three villages are,however,well placed
 for all forms of transport,the area   
 being crossed by motorways,roads and  
 a main railway link at Rugby.The North
 Oxford Canal operates in this area and
 the River Avon is but a "stones throw 
 away."                                
   Clifton is the largest of the three 
 villages and is the only one with a   
 school,which caters for children up to
 the age of eight.                     
   Each village still represents the   
 essence of village life,with annual   
 events to bring the community         
 together,whilst still preserving the  
 peace and tranquillity of rural life.
