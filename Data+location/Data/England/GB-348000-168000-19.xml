		<title>19GROWTH OF BACKWELL</title>
		<content> Backwell used to be four hamlets (West
 town,Farleigh,Church Town and Backwell
 itself.)These hamlets spread out and  
 formed a larger village,Backwell.These
 parts remain and have the A370 running
 through them.                         
    The houses are fairly large, some  
 with thatched roofs, small windows,   
 small doors and chimneys. Most of them
 have large gardens.                   
    Some of the old buildings have been
 converted into houses,e.g. the old    
 bakery and the old school house. The  
 younger houses are built of limestone 
 with slate roofs and the modern houses
 are built of brick.                   
    Backwell used to be a farming area 
 and the labourers used to live in     
 Backwell village. Now most of the     
 people go to work in Bristol and      
 nearby towns.  Backwell has at least  
 doubled in the last twenty years.     </content>
