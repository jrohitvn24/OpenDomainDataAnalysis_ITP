		<title>17PERTENHALL CHURCH</title>
		<content>  {The church}dates from Anglo-Saxon   
 times, but the main aisle and tower   
 were added in the 14th century. There 
 is a fine example of an Anglo-Saxon   
 arched doorway and some interesting   
 mullioned windows.                    
   The church is one of six which make 
 up the parish of Stogen Churches.     
 There is a Rector and a part-time     
 deaconess.                            
   Inside the church there are         
 approximately forty pews, an organ,   
 belfry, font, carved pulpit, and choir
 stalls.                               
   There is a crusader's tomb and an   
 engraved coat of arms which dates back
 to the Wars of the Roses.There are two
 spiral staircases leading to the      
 tower, one of which may have been used
 as a priest's hole in the Reformation.
