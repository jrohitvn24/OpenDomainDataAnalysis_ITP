		<content>   Surfing is a wide spread sport in   
 Jersey now. The surf is classed as one
 of the best in Europe.The Jersey wave 
 is mostly a shortboard wave, but on   
 "big days", occurring occasionally,   
 large boards called{guns}are used.    
  Quite a few world championships have 
 been held in Jersey.                  
   Sailboarding or Windsurfing is also 
 a growing sport as there is always a  
 beach not far away. On windy days when
 there is no surf, sail boards can be  
 seen doing 20 knots across the        
 bay. For this, a long board with a    
 large sail is used. On a choppy rough 
 day when the surf is up, a shorter    
 board and sail are used for wave      
 jumping. This is hitting the wave just
 before it breaks and going about 10   
 feet in the air. Low pressure and     
 north_westerly winds ensure perfect   
 surfing conditions.                   </content>
