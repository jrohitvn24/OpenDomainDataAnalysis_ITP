		<title>01Shepperton Lock</title>
		<content> In 1810, an Act of Parliament         
 empowered the Corporations of London  
 to 'erect' four pound locks. The one  
 at Shepperton was actually built in   
 1813 and rebuilt in 1825. The lock is 
 150 feet long and 20 feet wide. At    
 its shallowest it is 20 feet deep.    
 Roughly 30,000 gallons of water pass  
 through the weirs ten gates each hour.
                                       
 The lock gates are hydraulically      
 operated during the day and manually  
 during the evening. The lock takes 4.5
 minutes to fill. The lock is cleaned  
 every day to prevent the accumulation 
 of algae.
