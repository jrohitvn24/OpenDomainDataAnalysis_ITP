		<title>17MAKING CIDER IN ST VEEP</title>
		<content>      Several farms in the area still  
 make{cider}in the traditonal way.     
      In autumm fallen{apples}are      
 gathered from local orchards and taken
 to the cider houses. The apples are   
 tipped into an{apple mill}which       
 reduces them to a fine pulp. The pulp 
 is then shovelled onto a layer of     
 straw in the{cider press.}This is     
 repeated, each time the ends of the   
 straw are turned in, over the pulp.   
 When it is 1.25m high, this{cheese,}as
 it is called, is pressed.             
      Several men are usually needed to
 help turn the screw, and this strenuos
 work causes a thirst which is slaked  
 by cider from an earlier making.      
{Apple juice}runs from the bottom of   
 the press, which is then poured into  
{barrels}and left to{ferment.}When it  
 considered ready, it can be drunk.
