		<title>05Milk Quotas - Heathylee</title>
		<content>     The milk quota was introduced by  
the E.E.C. because there was too much  
milk.  It is not liked because it means
that the small farmers will be less    
well off than the larger farmers who   
had a bigger quota.                    
     We interviewed a farmer and he    
said that he had made the following    
changes of farming policy to cope with 
the effects of the quotas:             
1.  He has reduced his corn bill by    
    rationing his cows.                
2.  He has joined the National Milk    
    Records Scheme so that he can cull 
    cows with low yields and poor      
    butterfats and ration the others   
    according to their yields.         
3.  He culls any animals that are wrong
    either in their udders or their    
    feet, or any that are ill, to avoid
    vets' bills.                       
                                       </content>
