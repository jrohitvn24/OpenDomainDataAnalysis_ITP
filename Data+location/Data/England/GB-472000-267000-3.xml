		<title>03SEDGEBROOK FARM - BRAMPTON</title>
		<content> SEDGEBROOK IS A FAMILY RUN FARM WHICH 
 COVERS A CONSIDERABLE PORTION OF OUR  
 SURVEY AREA.  MR. WILLIAM COWLEY, HIS 
 WIFE AND SONS CONCENTRATE MOSTLY ON   
 ANIMALS WITH ONLY A FEW CROPS GROWN AS
 WINTER FEED FOR THE LIVESTOCK.        
 THERE ARE SEVERAL DOMESTIC ANIMALS    
 KEPT AS PETS AROUND THE FARM BUT THE  
 BUSINESS SIDE CONCENTRATES MAINLY ON  
 SHEEP WITH A FEW BEEF CATTLE.         
 LIFE ON THE FARM INVOLVES LONG WORKING
 HOURS AND MUCH PHYSICAL LABOUR BUT IS 
 AMPLY REWARDED BY THE TREMENDOUS      
 AMOUNT OF JOB SATISFACTION.           
 THE FAMILY RISES EARLY IN THE MORNING,
 HAS A HEARTY BREAKFAST OF CEREALS, EGG
 AND BACON, TOAST AND MARMALADE, PLUS A
 CUP OF COFFEE.                        
 THE ANIMALS HAVE TO BE FED BEFORE THE 
 DAILY CHORES ARE TACKLED AND NORMALLY 
 THEY ARE SETTLED LAST, AT THE END OF A
 BUSY DAY WHATEVER THE WEATHER.        </content>
