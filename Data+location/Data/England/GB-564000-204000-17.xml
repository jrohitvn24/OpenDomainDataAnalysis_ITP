		<title>17WRITTLE,MARCONI WORKS</title>
		<content> Whilst Writtle has a fascinating past,
 it is also very much to the fore with 
 the latest developments in radio and  
 telecommunications, based at the      
 Marconi works in Lawford Lane. Indeed 
 Writtle can proudly claim to have been
 in at the very beginnings of radio    
 broadcasting.                         
             Guglielmo Marconi was an  
 Italian inventor born in 1874 and his 
 first wireless telegraphy factory was 
 established in Chelmsfored in 1878.   
             From these humble         
 beginnings the first regular radio    
 broadcast service in Britain began    
 from a wooden shed in Lawford Lane,   
 Writtle on February 14th.1922. This   
 radio station was called '2MT WRITTLE'
