		<title>01Summary of the area.</title>
		<content> This is an area predominantly         
 agricultural in character and         
 depending significantly on farming for
 its economic and social stability.    
 There is a well_established quarrying 
 industry contributing to the male     
 employment in the immediate locality  
 as well as a healthy timber trade     
 associated with the Greenwich Hospital
 Estate at Middleton.The village itself
 provides banking,medical,shopping,    
 garage and hotel facilities for a     
 scattered population and is           
 spiritually served by an Anglican and 
 2 Presbyterian churches.Schooling to  
 age 13 is provided by First and Middle
 schools.Recently the village was      
 by_passed with some economic impact on
 shops and hotels.
