		<content> Farming in East Anglia has been a     
 major industry for centuries. The rich
 soil and reasonably flat surfaces make
 the growing of corns and vegetables   
 the most profitable usage of land. The
 eleven farms in our grid use the      
 fertile soil to grow Winter Barley,   
 Winter Wheat, Spring Barley, Oilweed  
 Rape, Apples and Sugar Beet. Most     
 farmers now use large machines and    
 very little labour on their farms.    
 Sowing and harvesting have become jobs
 for one man and one machine. Most     
 farms are mixed i.e. farmers keep     
 livestock as well as cultivate the    
 land. Pigs, battery hens, milking     
 cows and beef cattle all can be       
 found in our area. All farmers are    
 very much aware of conservation and   
 wildlife is protected as much as      
 possible with some of the land left as
 woodland and pastureland.             </content>
