		<content> A Councillor for Manchester           
 City Council came into school to be   
 interviewed. She came to Didsbury in  
 1947 and liked it so much she stayed  
 .We asked her in what ways she would  
 wish to see the area improved. She    
 expressed concern at the slovenly     
 attitudes of people today - for       
 example in their treatment of the     
 environment.She felt that vandalism   
 had incresed and should be dealt with 
 severely, for example by on the spot  
 fines.She told us that local          
 councillors are not paid for their    
 work which often involves them in a   
 great deal of hard work.
