		<title>11SUNDAY SCHOOL IN WILDEN.</title>
		<content> I like Sunday School. It tells you    
 about God and Jesus. He is my         
 friend.About 15 of us go. My best     
 friend is only three she goes.So does 
 Susan she's eleven.                   
 We go once a month, and practice hims 
 with Chrissie up her house on         
 Thursdays too. The morning starts with
 the rector talking to us then Chrissie
 plays a him. She's blind. Then we     
 split up into groups. The little ones 
 go with Rachel to colour and draw. My 
 group has talks, and writing sometimes
 drawing. We're doing a project wich   
 will be ready at Xmas.                
 Then we all come together for joint   
 prayers at the end then we go home and
 have dinner. When I'm old like Rachel 
 she's 12, I shall ask recter if I can 
 help. I shall ask God to help me      
 too.Amen.
