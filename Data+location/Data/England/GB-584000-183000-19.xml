 If you are going along the ray on a   
 boat towards Leigh Creek, you will    
 pass Southend, Westcliff, Chalkwell   
 and Old Leigh. The ray is a deep      
 channel of water about a mile from    
 Southend fore-shore. It is used by the
 fishing industry or any large boats   
 making for Leigh. The baginning of the
 ray is marked by the Leigh buoy. At   
 high tide the water is 12 feet and    
 when you get to the ray it drops to 60
 feet. It is one of the best defined   
 water channels in Britain. It used to 
 be owned by the Salvation Army but    
 they sold it to Southend Council. From
 the boat you can see the Royal Hotel, 
 the Cliffs Pavilion, the Alexandra    
 Yacht Club, the Cliff Gardens, beach  
 huts, kiosks, Chalkwell station &amp; St  
 Clements church.
