		<content>  There are many foxes in the area.    
 Foxes mostly steal young lambs from   
 the fields.Foxes are snared or shot by
 gamekeepers.They are mostly seen arou-
 nd farms at night. They are pests to  
 farmers and people who keep chickens. 
  Polecats eat fish,rabbits or any lame
 bird.They live in rabbit holes or any 
 old barns.To catch their fish they    
 wait silently until a fish comes to   
 the edge of the water, then grabs     
 them.                                 
  Weasels and stoats are much the same 
 as polecats.They eat the same and live
 in the same places.Pigeons are pests  
 to farmers they eat corn,peas or any- 
 thing that is planted in fields or    
 gardens.Squirrels eat nuts and eggs   
 some times they attack pigeons and eat
 them.Stags are a sort of a golden     
 colour and they have antlers on their 
 heads.                                </content>
