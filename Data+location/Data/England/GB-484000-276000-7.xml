		<content>                                       
The Market is a very busy place. It is 
the busiest on Saturdays.  Kettering   
Market owes it foundation to  a charter
granted in 1227 by Henry 111 to        
Peterborough Monastery allowing a      
Market to be held at Kettering.Most    
people who work on the Market come from
Leicester and from Kettering.The most  
popular stall sells fruit and          
vegetables.There are also stalls       
selling clothes,shoes,sweets,hosiery,  
flowers,fabrics,records,household      
goods and dairy produce.The Market is  
held every Friday and Saturday.There is
no Market on Good Friday. On a         
Wednesday there is an antique market.  
There is always a busy atmosphere with 
people rushing about.Some stall        
holders stand quietly waiting for      
somebody to buy their goods.
