		<content> In 1965, Local Government             
 reorganization placed a county        
 boundary between Staploe and St.      
 Mary's Church, Eaton Socon, to whose  
 parish it belongs. Distance makes     
 frequent attendance difficult for the 
 very young and the old. The           
 administrative parish has two places  
 of worship. The Methodist Chapel in   
 Honeydon, built in 1872 for Â£92, is   
 the smallest in the circuit,seating   
 50. Services are held once a month. A 
 car scheme to bring the elderly from  
 the other hamlets has increased the   
 congregation. The Chapel has been     
 refurbished inside and out. The pews  
 were removed some years ago making it 
 available for certain functions and   
 meetings. Staploe has the last of 7   
 non-denominational Gospel Halls       
 founded in 1880's. There are no longer
 services and it is under a trust.     </content>
