		<title>13CHOSLEY  FARM  AREA</title>
		<content> About a mile north of the main Alton  
 road in the direction of Greywell is  
 Chosley Farm. The primary land cover  
 is intensively managed grassland. Some
 corn, barley and wheat are grown in   
 the fields. The secondary land cover  
 is enclosed rough, grazing land, for  
 livestock on the farm. There is a herd
 of Jersey cows and sheep which are    
 reared for their meat and wool. A     
 small number of chickens are kept.    
 Chosley Farm has two farm buildings,  
 four barns, and two garages. A side   
 track with a concrete surface, leads  
 from Greywell into Odiham.            
 There are neither houses nor shops in 
 this area. Located in the area is the 
 site of a prehistoric and             
 Romano-British village.
