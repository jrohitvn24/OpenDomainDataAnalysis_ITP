 heat{greenhouses}.The{methane gas}is  
 being given off by rotting{refuse}at  
 an old quarry which has now been      
 filled in.The owner of the farm hopes 
 to have sixteen acres of{greenhouses. 
 The plants that are grown there are   
 going to be sent to Bilham nurseries  
 to be sold.The farmer who is going to 
 do it wants a worker who knows the    
 area well.The trustees of Brodsworth  
 estate have applied to Doncaster      
 council for planning permission.It is 
 a new use for{refuse}brought about by 
 the application of modern{science and 
{technology}to heat the{greenhouses .  
 Council dustbin lorries still tip     
 their{refuse}there.At Warren disused  
 quarry farmers and dustbin lorries tip
 there,perhaps in the future that could
 be used for the same perpose.         </content>
