		<title>12Religion Mount Bures Church</title>
		<content>    On Friday 7th June l985 my group,  
 another group and I went to Mount     
 Bures Church.  There was a lady there 
 who told us a lot about the church.   
    She told us that it was dedicated  
 to Saint John the Baptist.  It is a   
 small church and was built somewhere  
 between l066 and lll9  by Roger of    
 Pitou. She thought that Roger         
 dedicated the church to Saint John in 
 memory of his mother, who had been    
 beheaded by robbers.                  
    There are three windows left in the
 church which were built by the        
 Normans.  These are small and round   
 headed.  The one in the south wall has
 now been blocked.                     
    At one time the church contained   
 part of an old wall painting, the     
 picture of which hangs in the church, 
 as well as what is possibly the oldest
 grave stone in Essex.                 </content>
