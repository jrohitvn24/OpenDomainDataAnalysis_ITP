		<title>08CHURCH FARM, AYLMERTON</title>
		<content>  A local farm typical of those in     
 North Norfolk, like the one we looked 
 at, covers about 300 hectares.  It has
 been passed through the owner's       
 family.  The present farmer has worked
 here for 30 years.                    
  Although 3,000 pigs are kept, they do
 not take up much land, and sugar beet,
 wheat and barley were also grown in   
 1985.  The corn is used to feed the   
 pigs, as well as 900 tonnes of other  
 foods bought in.  The{Landrace}and    
{Whitecross pigs}are fattened and sold 
 to Sainsburys Foods.                  
  The machinery is much more efficient 
 than 30 years ago.  The main items are
 harvesters, tractors and pig          
 machinery.  The buildings are used for
 the pigs and corn storage.  Eight     
 workers are employed on the farm, and 
 they start work at 7.30a.m., finishing
 at 7.30p.m. (5.30p.m. in winter).     </content>
