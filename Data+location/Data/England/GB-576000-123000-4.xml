		<content>   Most of the children are able to    
 walk to the school, some go by car and
 a few cycle. Amongst the senior       
 pupils the most popular academic      
 subjects are Maths and English, but   
 Science and French are popular too. A 
 number of children enjoy Sports Club  
 after school and they can use the     
 swimming pool in the Summer holidays. 
   Many of the children like to spend  
 their spare time cycling, horse riding
 and participating in other outdoor    
 activities with their families. Indoor
 activities include reading, drawing,  
 sewing and watching television.       
   Almost every child's parents own a  
 car, and the majority of the family   
 shopping is done in Hastings. Less    
 than half of the working parents are  
 employed within the village; a good   
 many travel to surrounding villages   
 and a few to London.                  </content>
