		<content>   Under the state schools system      
 children between 5-11 attend the      
 primary school at North Cadbury while 
 those between 12-16 in Woolston and   
 Compton Pauncefoot attend Ansford     
 School,Castle Cary and those in       
 Blackford and Maperton go to King     
 Arthur's School,Wincanton.Those in    
 state education are mainly children of
 farmers and farm workers.The children 
 of professional people are in general 
 educated privately in nearby schools  
 in Bruton,Sherborne and Sparkford as  
 boarders or as day pupils.Because of  
 the distance involved school transport
 is provided for all the children of   
 the area attending state schools.As   
 the number of children living in the  
 area drops so the continued existence 
 of the small village primary school is
 called into question.In 1984 its      
 teaching staff was cut from 4 to 3.   </content>
