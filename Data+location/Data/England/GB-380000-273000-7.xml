		<title>07Kidderminster, The Canal</title>
		<content>  The{Stafforshire and Worcestershire  
{Canal}was built between 1766 and l772 
 under the direction of James Brindley 
 and joined the rivers Trent and       
 Severn, creating a new town at{       
{Stourport.                            
 The canal was built at a cost of about
 Â£100,000 and had 47 locks in its 52   
 miles.                                
 The Staffordshire and Worcestershire  
 Canal Company seems to have been well 
 managed, the initial purchasers of    
 shares at Â£100 were able to sell them 
 at up to Â£400.                        
 Barges carried a multitude of items   
 but coal, iron-ware, glass, pottery,  
 textiles and agricultural products    
 accounted for the majority.
