		<title>19SUMMERCROFT JUNIOR SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The school was built in 1963 and has  
 eight classrooms and one teacher to   
 each class. We come to school 5 days a
 week from 8.55 till 3.15pm with a     
 break at 10.20am and one from noon    
 until 1.10pm. In the afternoon we     
 usually have games. You stay at this  
 school for 4 years. We have about 6   
 holidays a year but the main ones are 
 at Easter, Christmas and summer. There
 are about 240 pupils in the school.   
 After you have been to this school you
 go to a secondary school where you    
 stay until you are 16 or 18.          
 School uniform consists of grey       
 shorts, grey socks, grey or white     
 shirt, grey or yellow jumper and      
 yellow and green tie. Girls do not    
 usually wear uniform. The other       
 schools have different uniforms. There
 is also a grey school blazer and cap  
 with a yellow and green badge.        </content>
