		<title>20What I Enjoyed.</title>
		<content> My name is Karen Beevers. I have      
 helped with the typing of this        
 project. Last Summer term I was a     
 third year pupil in{Mr Little's }     
 class. I took part in all the trips   
 and visits  and enjoyed them all a    
 great deal. I thought the most        
 interesting of these talks was the    
 talk and visit by Commander Gammon,   
 though the most fun was gathered from 
 the trip with Mr Breeds on Braunton   
 Burrows.                              
  I have learnt a lot and also because 
 I have been involved with the         
 computer, I now feel quite at home    
 with disks, the keyboard etc.
