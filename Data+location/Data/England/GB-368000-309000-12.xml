		<title>12A TYPICAL WEEKEND</title>
		<content> We looked at how the children in our  
 class of 9 and 10 year olds, at St.   
 Georges Primary School, spent a       
 typical weekend from midnight on      
 Friday to midnight on Sunday. We found
 out that the average child spent 19   
 hours sleeping, 2 hours on personal   
 hygiene, 4 hours eating, 20 minutes   
 watching T.V. and eating at the same  
 time, 4 hours watching T.V., 2 hours  
 were playing inside, 1 hour resting,  
 6 hours playing outside, 2 hours for  
 public recreation like swimming,      
 skating and other sports, 4 hours     
 visiting friends and relations, 20    
 minutes for religion, such as church  
 and Sunday school, and 1 hour was used
 for shopping.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
