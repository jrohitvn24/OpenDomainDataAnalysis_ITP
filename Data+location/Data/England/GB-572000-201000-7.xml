		<title>07SOUTHLANDS FARM CHELMSFORD</title>
		<content>   Southlands Farm has exactly 156     
 acres of land. The farmer's wife has  
 traced the farm back to 1746, and it  
 goes back even further than the       
 original Domesday Book itself.        
   They grow peas, oats, wheat and     
 barley. The peas are harvested first  
 of all, at the beginning of July. The 
 barley is harvested in the middle of  
 July and the wheat in August. Their   
 crops are sold to whichever corn      
 merchant will give them the best      
 price.                                
   The farmer has many large barns.The 
 largest is the grain store. There is  
 one open barn in which all the straw  
 from the wheat and barley fields is   
 kept.
