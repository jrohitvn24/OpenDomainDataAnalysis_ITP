 of Rockwell,which is made from a      
 basalt type rock which has been heated
 and spun and looks like insulating    
 fibre,no earth or peat is used.They   
 grow in the main houses,(a great deal 
 heat has to be used during the winter)
 and picking starts in February and    
 continues until October on the same   
 plants.The tomato plants grow to about
