		<title>10WRAGBY PARISH CHURCH</title>
		<content> The Parish Church in Wragby goes back 
 to the early Sixteenth Century, with  
 records of births, baptisms and       
 marriages from 1538, amongst the      
 earliest in England.                  
                                       
 The Church is famous for its Sixteenth
 Century stained glass windows which   
 were collected by Mr. Winn who is now 
 buried in the Church grounds. At      
 present these have been removed for   
 safety reasons as the NCB are mining  
 coal from under the Church.           
                                       
 The present Church organ was installed
 in the Church in 1902 replacing an    
 older worn out organ. It originally   
 came from the Priory music room in    
 which it was placed in 1844 but parts 
 of it are thought to be older. The    
 Church has hundreds of visitors of    
 various nationalities each year.      </content>
