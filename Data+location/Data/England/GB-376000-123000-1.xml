		<title>01North Dorset Scene</title>
		<content> The north of Dorset is a place of     
 quiet beauty, being close enough to   
 main roads for convenience and well   
 served by many minor roads, all kept  
 in a good state of repair.The geology 
 of the area dictates the main         
 ocupations.Heavy day soil ensures     
 ample water supply and lush grass for 
 dairy and store cattle.A ridge of     
 broken limestone provides ideal       
 grazing conditions for breeding and   
 raising horses.Many famous racehorses 
 started life on the fields around     
 Sandley Bugley and langham.The river  
 Stour winds its way along a wide flood
 plain to the east of the              
 ridge,creating the scenery which      
 delights artists and anglers.It is    
 known as 'Constable country' a        
 reference to that famous artist's     
 paintings of our riverside vistas in  
 the early nineteenth century.         </content>
