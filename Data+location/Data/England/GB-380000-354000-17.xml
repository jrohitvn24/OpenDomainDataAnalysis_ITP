 On July 1st 1985  we did a survey of  
 the {A5011}which is a busy main road  
 linking Butt Lane-Church Lawton. Our  
 square is mainly agricultural except  
 for this busy road which leads to the 
 motorway, Talke and the factories. We 
 surveyed the traffic for 5 minutes and
 then we found the average of traffic  
 for one hour. These are the results   
 made into a chart.                    
           in 5 mins       in one hour 
{Pedestrians    2               24     
{Vans           9              108     
{Cars          68              816     
{Lorries        6               72     
{Motorbikes     2               24     
 We saw no one riding a bike. Although 
 we saw no buses we did look at a bus  
 time-table. The buses run from Hanley-
 Radway Green or to Sandbach. About 7-8
 buses go past Linley Stores each day. </content>
