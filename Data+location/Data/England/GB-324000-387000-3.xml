 In the playground we play lots of     
 games,we play{Charlie}Chase.How we    
 play it is,we get ten or twenty       
 children and we dip who is on and the 
 person who is on has to shut their    
 eyes and turn around andpoint to some 
 one and the person who has been       
 pointed to has to run and the person  
 who is on has to run after them and   
 then they run back to the others ,how 
 we dip is:_We make a circle and I dip 
 and I say "dippy doppy dippy doo it   
 shall not be you because I say so,so  
 out you must go" and when Isay go that
 person is on and I choose them in     
 turns..... {These are some games      
{played by infant school children.     
{ }
