		<content> The area contains no field monuments  
 of any significance, but much of      
 archaeological interest has been      
 revealed by air photographs and       
 excavations. Nothing predates the     
 early Neolithic pottery found during  
 excavations in 1963 in fields to the  
 north of the A4 opposite Milehouse    
 Farm. Air photographs have revealed 7 
 circles and 2 conjoined circles of    
 indeterminate date and function at    
 615695. Late Iron Age and early Roman 
 period structures were excavated in   
 1961-2 at 617690. Just east of this   
 and crossing the present A4 at 618695 
 is a linear feature which is almost   
 certainly the Roman road from the     
 North gate at Silchester. The 19th    
 century field system north of The     
 Fishery can still be seen clearly in  
 the air photographs.
