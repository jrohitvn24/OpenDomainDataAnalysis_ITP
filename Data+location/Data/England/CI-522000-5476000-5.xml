		<title>05LIHOU ISLAND-THE RESIDENTS</title>
		<content> Mr.and Mrs.Robin Borwick live on{Lihou
{Island}with one horse,one donkey,a    
 peacock and peahen,4 chickens and 31  
 baby ducks. In September 1985 they    
 are going to have a baby donkey. They 
 travel round the island in a red jeep.
 The house is very old fashioned.It has
 white windows and in one of the       
 bedrooms they have a four poster bed. 
 They also have a swimming pool. Mrs.  
 Borwick makes{dolls houses}and little 
 dolls. One day after school I went to 
 see them. The dolls houses are very   
 valuable and Mrs. Borwick told me how 
 to make them. She makes the little    
 dolls out of cardboard,cotton reels   
 and wool. Some houses she buys and    
 some she makes. It takes 2 days to    
 make one and a week to make a dolls   
 house.
