		<title>18THE  SAMLESBURY  WITCHES</title>
		<content>In August 1612, the most famous witch  
trials in English history were held at 
Lancaster Castle and involved seven    
residents of Samlesbury. The alleged   
victim, Grace Sowerbutts, testified    
that her grandmother, Aunt Ellen and   
Jane Southworth had bewitched her and  
also a very young child, whose parents 
lived at The Boathouse.The baby died   
and soon after its burial in the church
yard, the withes were supposed to have 
exhumed the body and cooked it.However,
the judges realised that Grace was     
committing perjury and as a result     
of sharp questioning, she admitted     
that the Rev. Christopher Southworth   
had put her up to it. The priest       
might have been taking revenge on his  
relative for becoming a Protestant. So 
the innocent  people of Samlesbury     
were aquitted, but others from Pendle  
were condemned to death.               </content>
