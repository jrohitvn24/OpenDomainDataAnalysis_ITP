   It is an average sized farm covering
 a total of 170 acres. The fields range
 in size from 2 - 23 acres. They are

 also permanent pasture for the 85     
 Friesian dairy cows.                  
   The milk is sold to the Milk        
 Marketing Board. Northern Daires

 bottling. Barren cows go for slaughter

 either Lichfield, Derby or Uttoxeter  
 market. Heifer claves are kept to add 
 to the herd.                          </content>
