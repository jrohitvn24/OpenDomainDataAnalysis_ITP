		<content> On Saturday 29th June in Winsham there
 was a special day.It was the 300th    
 anniversary of the Monmouth           
 Rebellion.On Friday we raked up the   
 grass on the Recreation Ground and    
 some people put up some Fairground    
 rides.There even was a thatched roof  
 on the Telephone Box.Early in the     
 morning people put up their           
 stalls.Everyone was supposed to wear  
 17th century costume.I was in a play  
 called "The Winsham Rebels".I was one 
 of the Maids of Taunton.The school had
 a 17th Century display .There were    
 Ploughman's Lunches in the Jubilee    
 Hall.My Mum had a Strawberries and    
 cream stall.There were lots of other  
 stalls and 17th Century Football on   
 the field.It was a great day.
