		<title>09FUN AT ABINGDON FAIR</title>
		<content>Its fun at the fair.  The twister is my
best, they say if you scream a lot you 
stay on longer.  I have only been on   
the Big Wheel once because when the    
cage is at the top of the wheel my dad 
swings it round.  I like going on the  
Tunnel of Love, first it goes slow,    
then fast and the lights flash, then it
slows down, then it stops still.  Then 
sometimes it starts going backwards    
then it goes faster and faster.  I     
always have candy floss or a hot dog.  
They are 40p each.  I like going on the
ghost train and it is very scary and I 
get frightened.  I also go on the      
dodgem cars, Little Wheel, Octopus and 
the Fun House.  I try to win a gold    
fish or a coconut on some of the other 
stalls.
