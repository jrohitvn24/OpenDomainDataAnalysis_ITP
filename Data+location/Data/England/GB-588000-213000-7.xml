		<title>07Damar Fashions,Tiptree</title>
		<content> Damar Fashions is one of four shops in
 a block.They are all owned by Mr.Jel. 
 It is along Church Road near Factory  
 Corner.Damar Fashions itself is a     
 fashion clothes shop,but also sells   
 records,albums and cassettes.The lady 
 who partly owns it,is called Mary     
 Epsom.The mangeress is my mum,called  
 Eira Cursons.We went to visit Damar   
 Fashions to ask some questions.The    
 questions were;How long have you      
 worked here? "Nine years"What is the  
 most popular thing you sell,clothes   
 wise? "Jeans,if we have any comments  
 they are mostly nice."We looked at    
 prices on some of the clothes,we      
 thought they were good value.A        
 customer told us,she likes to buy     
 fashionable clothes and spends an     
 average of twentyfive pounds.
