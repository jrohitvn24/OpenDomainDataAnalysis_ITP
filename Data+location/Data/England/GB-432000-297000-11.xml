		<title>11"No!" to boundary proposal</title>
		<content> In the autumn of 1984 the North       
 Warwickshire Borough Council suggested
 to the Boundary Commission that the   
 villages of Witherley and Ratcliffe   
 Culey and seven  other villages be    
 transferred from Leicestershire to    
 Warwickshire by changing the county   
 boundary.                             
                                       
 At present this boundary runs along   
 the old Roman road called the Watling 
 Street, and has done for over a       
 thousand years. Although these        
 villages are on the edge of           
 Leicestershire, and although many of  
 the villagers work and shop in        
 Warwickshire towns nearby, it was     
 evident that they strongly rejected   
 this proposal. Parish meetings were   
 crowded out, and virtually unanimous  
 opposition was expressed.
