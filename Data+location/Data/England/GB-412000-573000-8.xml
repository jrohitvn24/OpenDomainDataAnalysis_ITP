		<title>08Ponteland CARE Activities</title>
		<content> The idea is to simulate as near a     
 normal life as can be achieved,a wide 
 range of useful &amp; productive activity 
 is an essential part of the way of    
 life.For example there is the         
 establishment of market gardening and 
 horticulture,where the end product is 
 used primarily in the village and the 
 surplus sold.Woodworking shops have   
 also been established producing a wide
 range of wooden toys,garden furniture,
 beds etc which have both a theraputic 
 effect to residents &amp; are marketable. 
  It is CARES philosophy that there    
 should be an end product to whatever  
 activity is attempted.Villagers also  
 assist in the normal domestic chores  
 of running a house being involved in  
 the kitchens &amp; food preparation for   
 the village,laundry &amp; housework.      
  On the social side there are visits  
 to local towns,villages,theatres etc. </content>
