		<title>12Princetown Church</title>
		<content> Princetown Church, St. Michael's and  
 All Angels,is interesting because of  
 its connections with the nearby       
 prison. It was built by French and    
 American prisoners of war between     
 1810-1814, during the Napoleonic Wars.
  In the church is a beautiful stained-
 glass window and at the bottom is some
 writing which says:                   
  'To the Glory of God and in memory of
 the American prisoners of war who were
 detained in the Dartmoor war prison   
 between the years 1813 and 1815 and   
 who helped to build this church,      
 especially of the 218 brave men who   
 died here on behalf of their country, 
 this window is presented by the       
 National Society United States        
 Daughters of 1812.'                   
  There are three flags in the church, 
 too. One is the English flag, one is  
 French and the other is American.     </content>
