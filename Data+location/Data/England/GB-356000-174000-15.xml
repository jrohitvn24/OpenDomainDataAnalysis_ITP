		<title>15DURDHAM AND CLIFTON DOWNS</title>
		<content>{ The Downs }consist of 441 acres of   
 green space , the largest in Bristol. 
 They are used , especially in summer ,
 by people from all over Bristol  for  
 walks , picnics , jogging and just    
 relaxing .                            
  Most visitors come to the big events,
 the fair , the circus and the Bristol 
 Flower Show , which are sited near the
 main road . But over by the Avon Gorge
 there are some woods and it is quieter
  It has been illegal to build here    
 since an Act of Parliament of 1861 .  
 People here feel very strongly it     
 should be preserved , but some said   
 yes to small changes like an adventure
 playground , small shelters and       
 toilets .                             
  One worry was pollution by dogs , as 
 lots of dogs are walked here . Many   
 people thought something should be    
 done but did not know what .          </content>
