		<title>05LOUGHBOROUGH MARKET</title>
		<content> The Loughborough Market is held in the
 town centre on Thursdays and Saturdays
 Most people come to the market more   
 than once a week.A lot of the people  
 who come live within two miles of     
 Loughborough but some people come from
 more than 5 miles away. Most people   
 get to market by car but quite alot   
 walk it.Most people come to the market
 to buy{fruit and vegetables}and       
 household goods.The thing that most   
 people like is the atmosphere and the 
 character of the market and they like 
 the old tradition.One of the          
 disadvantages of shopping there is    
 that you cannot get everything you    
 want and it can be dirty. People would
 rather have the market indoors in     
 winter because of the rain and snow.  
 In the summer the people would  rather
 have it outdoors because of  the nice 
 weather.                              </content>
