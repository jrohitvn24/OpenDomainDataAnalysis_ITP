		<content>     Our survey of 150 homes found the 
 average house has 4 people and 10     
 rooms. The favourite meal is a roast  
 beef Sunday lunch, but continental    
 foods, salads and chips are popular.  
 Most families eat cereal and toast for
 breakfast and bacon and eggs at       
 weekends.                             
     All families own a TV and the     
 majority a feezer and washing machine.
 A few families own videos, computers  
 and microwave ovens. Duvets are       
 replacing blankets. Most homes have   
 gardens growing mainly flowers, a few 
 vegetables and fruit. Dogs and cats   
 are the most popular pets followed by 
 rabbits, fish, Guinea pigs, birds and 
 horses.                               
     Out of the 150 homes in the survey
 4 have tennis courts, 3 have swimming 
 pools, 2 have games rooms and 4 have  
 stables.                              </content>
