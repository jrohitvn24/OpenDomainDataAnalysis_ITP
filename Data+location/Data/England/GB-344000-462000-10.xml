		<content> But although some local labour is used
 it is not what was hoped for. Because 
 employment is largely dependant on    
 tourism it means that ther are far    
 more people unemployed in winter.     
 Morecambe has a high proportion of    
 elderly residents. It is an attractive
 area to retire to. Because of this    
 there has been a big increase in      
 retirement and nursing homes and      
 because the holiday trade has declined
 many hotels have become residential   
 homes for the elderly. Like the hotels
 they require catering and cleaning    
 staff and in addition nursing staff.  
 There is some light industry on the   
 newly created White Lund Industrial   
 estate but without the employment     
 created by tourism Morecambe would be 
 a very different place.
