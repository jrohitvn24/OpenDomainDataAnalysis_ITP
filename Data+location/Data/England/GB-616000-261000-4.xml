		<content>Further changes followed.At first,the  
land was used mainly for grain crops,  
but by 1980 40% of these had been      
replaced by oilseed rape.Since 1982,   
subsidies have been offered for beans, 
so there has been a further change in  
the crops grown.                       
  Despite the decline of habitat,there 
has been an increase recently in the   
number of bee-keepers,all of whom are  
glad of the replacement of rape by     
beans.There are now twelve bee-keepers 
in the area,none of them commercial.   
One of them has 30 hives,the others    
fewer than 10.                         
  The whole area is criss-crossed with 
bridleways and footpaths,so Debenham is
an ideal village for walkers and riders
Paths are not always easy to find since
the hedgerows they once followed have  
long since been bulldozed. Many have   
been re-routed to follow new boundaries</content>
