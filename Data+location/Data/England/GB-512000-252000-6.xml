		<title>06Lace Making</title>
		<content> Lace making was once a widespread     
 cottage industry in Bedfordshire.Now  
 it is regaining popularity as a hobby 
 and it is a popular evening class     
 activity.This can be seen as part of  
 the general revival of interest in    
 crafts,bygones and local history.     
 To make lace you need a lace pillow   
 and bobbins.Bobbins are usually made  
 of wood or bone.All except the South  
 Bucks bobbins have a ring of beads to 
 give extra weight,add a bit of colour 
 and keep the bobbin steady against the
 pillow.The bottom bead is usually     
 larger than the rest.Bobbins are      
 usually 3 to 4 inches long.           
 One local group is called the Aragon  
 Lacemakers and their members often    
 display their work at village Craft   
 Fayres.Children at Alban School also  
 do lace making as a hobby.
