		<title>08OPEN-CAST MINING AT AMBLE</title>
		<content> The{three main open-cast sites}in the 
 Amble area are at{East Chevington,    
{Acklington, and Togston.}About{279    
 people are{employed by the N.C.B.}who 
 own the sites.{Open-cast mining}is a  
{cheaper and easier way to extract coal
 than{deep mining which it has replaced
 in the area. The{method of open-cast  
 mining is as follows:-{firstly the top
{soil and subsoil are ripped off}and   
{put into mounds or baffle-banks.}These
 prevent noise, vibration, and dust.   
 Using{a drag-line}which costs about   
 Â£6.5 million they can{descend 90m.}to 
{coal seams which are about 0.4-1.5 m. 
{thick.}The coal that is mined is used 
 for{power stations, households, or    
{mixed with deep mined coal.}It takes  
 from{1.5-2 years to restore a site.}At
{Chevington}they are doing{progressive 
{restoration i.e. they are restoring in
 parts and mining other areas.         </content>
