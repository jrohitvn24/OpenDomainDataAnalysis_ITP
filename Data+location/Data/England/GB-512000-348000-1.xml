 An area of open Fen with a few small  
 copses of decidious trees.  The land  
 is divided into large fields by       
 drainage ditches and a few hedges     
 alongside the road.  The crops are    
 sugarbeet, potatoes, grain, oilseed   
 rape &amp; Peas.  The public road,(its has
 a 3 tonne weight restriction), from   
 Ewerby Thorpe to Halfpenny Hatch      
 provides access to the fields.  Part  
 of the Sleaford-Skegness road, (built 
 of concrete on a bank avove the Few)  
 runs through squares 1 &amp; 2.  The  few 
 farms &amp; dwellings are very isolated.  
 The river Slea runs through the block 
 from east to west. In the past it was 
 embanked as a canal but is now only   
 used for land drainage; although a    
 preservation society is attempting to 
 reopen this stretch for pleasure      
 boating.                              </content>
