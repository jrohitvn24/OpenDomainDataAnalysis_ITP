 In our area there are lots of cars    
 and some motor bikes.  We need cars in
 Christow and Bridford because the     
 closest towns, Exeter and Newton      
 Abbot, are about eleven miles away.   
 We get a bus three of four times a    
 day during the week but they carry few
 passengers because the fares are      
 expensive.  Most of the buses go to   
 Exeter.  The buses are useful for old 
 people and children who do not own    
 cars.                                 
                                       
 There is a taxi service to and from   
 school if the children live a long way
 from the Primary School.  Coaches     
 take the senior school pupils to Teign
 School at Kingsteignton.
