 The section studied shows two         
 distinct areas of population.Calow    
 itself is a residential area with a   
 mixture of private and council owned  
 property. There is no industry and    
 very few work oppurtunities.Most of   
 the people travel out of Calow to     
 work.                                 
 Arkwright Town was built when the mine
 was sunk.The five rows of houses were 
 for the miners and their families     
 only.Recently the miners have been    
 able to buy their houses and many have
 now been modernised and improved.     
 Surrounding both settlements is farm  
 land and small amounts of deciduous   
 woodland.                             
 Both communities are linked by the    
 main Chesterfield to Bolsover road.   
 There are strong family links between 
 the two communities.                  </content>
