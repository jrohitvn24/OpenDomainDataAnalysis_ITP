		<content>     The history of the park is varied.
Thention of the land is in a document  
stating the land to be a deer park     
owned by the Coney family in 1449.It   
remained in that family until the      
seventeenth century when it was sold   
to the Parker family.This family gave  
its name to the Park Hall area.In the  
nineteenth century the first sandstone 
quarries were opened.Between 1939 and  
1970 extensive quarrying of sand and   
gravel took place.After 1970 sand and  
gravel extraction stopped.The park     
became what can only be described as   
a rubbish tip.                         
     The park area was taken over      
by Stoke-on-Trent and Staffordshire    
councils and the complete area was     
reclaimed.The former quarry faces      
were made safe and turned into         
attractive canyons.Car parks,walkways,
