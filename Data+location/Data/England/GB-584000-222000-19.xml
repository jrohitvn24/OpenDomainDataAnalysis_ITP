		<content>{POLITICS}The Parish Council is elected
 by the people of Coggeshall to        
 represent them.Every four years the   
 Parish Council elects a Chairman Brian
 Haynes is the present Chairman.At the 
 moment the Parish Council owns 25     
 acres of land,about 10 acres being    
 recreation ground.They collect money  
 from house owners in the district     
 "rates" and use it in maintaning      
 footpaths,street lights,grass cutting 
 and churchyards.They also voluntarly  
 keep the streets tidy because they    
 feel it should be done properly.They  
 have rather limited powers and can    
 only comment on planning applications 
 for new houses etc.The District       
 Council (based at Braintree)makes the 
 final decision.Two of the governors of
 the schools have to be  Parish        
 Councillors.The Council employs three 
 people to work in Coggeshall.         </content>
