		<content>   The old Peak Railway from Buxton to 
 Matlock station used to carry         
 passengers and goods but{it was closed
{down in  1963.}The railway builders   
 tried to keep the track as straight   
  and flat as possible.The road and    
 railway in the valley run alongside   
 the river Wye.                        
    To build the railway, millions of  
 tonnes of stone had to be moved by men
 using spades,picks and wheelbarrows.  
 The stones were removed from the hills
 and were used to fill the hollows.    
     Along the track there are two     
{tunnels}and {eight bridges.           
   {Peak Rail Preservation Society are 
{trying to re-open the railway.}They   
 have already started to work on it    
 At the moment, part of the track-bed  
 is used as a footpath :the{MONSAL     
{TRAIL.
