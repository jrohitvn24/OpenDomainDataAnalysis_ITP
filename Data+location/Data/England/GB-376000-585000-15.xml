		<title>15Tarset Castle</title>
		<content> The site of the castle is a huge earth
 mound with steeply sloping sides.  On 
 the west and north it is bounded by   
 the Tarset burn and a deep dry ditch  
 has been dug around the eastern side. 
 On top is a surprisingly large, level 
 area with some grass-grown stone      
 foundations.  The old railway cuts    
 through the southern side where the   
 slope falls steeply to the valley     
 floor.  From the top we had           
 mignificent views up the Tarset valley
 and both up and down the North Tyne   
 valley.  We could see the site,       
 overlooking crossing places on both   
 Tyne and Tarset, had been well chosen 
 for defence.  There are some unusual  
 chiselled steps to the loft at Tarset 
 hall.  We think these may have come   
 from the castle as we think the stone 
 to build the house did also.
