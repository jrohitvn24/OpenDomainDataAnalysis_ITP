THE NAME OF MY SCHOOL IS CHURNET VIEW  
MIDDLE SCHOOL. IT IS A FAIRLY NEW      
SCHOOL AS IT HAS ONLY BEEN BUILT FOR   
FOUR YEARS. THERE ARE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED
CHILDREN IN THE SCHOOL AGED NINE TO    
THIRTEEN YEARS.                        
                                       
THE CHILDREN ALL COME FROM   DIFFERENT 
AREAS IN AND AROUND LEEK. MANY OF THE  
CHILDREN HAVE TO COME TO SCHOOL BY     
SPECIAL BUSES AS THEY LIVE MANY MILES  
AWAY FROM SCHOOL IN THE SURROUNDING    
COUNTRYSIDE.                           
BEFORE THEY COME TO CHURNET VIEW MANY  
OF THE CHILDREN HAVE ONLY BEEN TO A    
SMALL VILLAGE SCHOOL AND ARE OFTEN     
SURPRISED AT THE SIZE OF THE SCHOOL BUT
THEY SOON GET USED TO IT.IN THE WINTER 
IF WE HAVE A LOT OF SNOW THE CHILDREN  
FROM THE COUNTRY HAVE TO GO HOME EARLY 
SO THAT THEY DON'T GET STRANDED IN TOWN</content>
