   The only means of public transport  
 in our area is the bus service.This   
 follows a route from Mansfield to     
 Matlock via Alfreton and Crich or     
 Alfreton and Wessington. The bus      
 passes through the area once per hour 
 in each direction. The buses are      
 one-man operated coaches owned by     
 Trent Transport. In our survey we     
 found that buses are used by 10% of   
 people to travel to work and by some  
 to shop in Alfreton.                  
 Our railway station closed 18 years   
 ago although the main Sheffield/London
 line runs through our area. The trains
 pass through approximately one every  
 two hours in each direction. They are 
 Inter-City 125 expresses.Coal trains  
 also use this line to travel from the 
 pits in North Derbyshire to the power 
 stations of the Trent Valley.         </content>
