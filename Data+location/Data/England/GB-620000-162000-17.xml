		<title>17CHISLET -OLD HOUSE AT CHITTY</title>
		<content> We have interviewed one person and she
 lives in a house which was built in   
 the 16th century.  The block I am     
 doing is Block B with three other     
 people - it has loads of crops, dykes,
 fields and some bridges but it hasn't 
 got very many houses.  At the moment  
 the crops are mainly wheat but there  
 are also fields of oil seed rape.     
 There are a lot of animals in the     
 block too, sheep, cows and in the air 
 there are birds and butterflies.      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
