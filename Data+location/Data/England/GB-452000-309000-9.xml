		<title>09THE ROMAN ROAD IN ANSTEY 2.</title>
		<content> This week our local newspaper had the 
 headline "{Road may be Roman}". Some  
 children and staff from our school    
 went to see the road.                 
 Yesterday another section of this     
 road, thoughtto be the {Via Devanna}, 
 was excavated at Newtwon Linford.     
 There are trees growing near the road 
 and their roots are lifting the top   
 layer off the road.                   
 The local historians and              
 archaeologists are hoping to prserve  
 this portion of the{Roman Road} which 
 runs through Anstey.  The land        
 however, has been taken over by the   
 Severn Trent Water Authority, Which   
 wants to build an underground         
 reservoir and pumping station on the  
 site.                                 
 To stop this section of road from     
 being destroyed more evidence is      
 needed that it is{Roman}.             </content>
