 Farming has been important in this    
 area for centuries:indeed until the   
 1960's it was the dominant            
 activity.Farms vary considerably in   
 size - from the small farm of 50acres 
 or so to the very large over 800      
 acres.Nevertheless all are mixed farms
 - livestock and crops (fodder and     
 cash) with an emphasis on beef cattle.
 There are no specialist farms.        
 Two farms were selected for more      
 detailed study:Broomhill and Kincraig.
 Broomhill Farm (GR 719716) is a small 
 mixed farn of 53 acres and is worked  
 by the owner and his family:there are 
 no employees though casual labour is  
 taken on at harvest time. The farm has
 Freisian beef cows and a Charollais   
 bull and rears beef calves which will 
 be sold at the market in Dingwall     
 (19km. away) for fattening.The farmer </content>
