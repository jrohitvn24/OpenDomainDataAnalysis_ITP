		<title>01THE COUNTRYSIDE</title>
		<content> This block lies in undulating country 
 between the Quantock Hills and the    
 Bristol Channel. 90% of the area is   
 farmland mainly intensively managed   
 grassland but with an increasing      
 acreage of other crops, especially    
 cereals and oil seed rape. There are  
 also some small areas of mixed        
 deciduous woodland. With the exception
 of the village of Storgursey,         
 settlement is mainly in the form of   
 small hamlets and scattered farms.    
 There are two large intensive rearing 
 poultry units and a french-owned      
 intensive calf rearing unit. The      
 village of Stogursey lies in the      
 extreme S.W. of the block. The        
 population is about 1500. Local       
 facilities include post office,       
 primary school, garage, butcher,      
 newsagent, baker, hairdresser, two    
 general stores and two public houses. </content>
