		<title>13Grand Union Canal (CONT)</title>
		<content> THE GREAT INFLATABLE BOAT RACE took   
 place on Sunday 10th June 1985.There  
 were 163 teams of 4 people who paddled
 along seven miles of the Grand Union  
 Canal from the Cow Roast Marina near  
 Tring to the Fishery Inn at Boxmoor.  
 The crews were from local clubs and   
 pubs and were often sponsored in aid  
 of their chosen charity.75 per cent of
 the crews finished although some were 
 sunk and there was the usual tipping  
 up to add to the excitement.          
 The winners were the crew from the    
 'Three Blackbirds' pub at Boxmoor.They
 had a record beating time of 116      
 mins.42 secs.                         
 On a more practical level the canal at
 Bourne End acts as the effluent point 
 for the local sewage works.This is a  
 fully automated works.Which serves    
 Tring Station,Berkhamsted,Northchurch 
 and Wiggington.                       </content>
