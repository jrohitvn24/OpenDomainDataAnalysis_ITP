		<title>08Bayswater Mill</title>
		<content>The Bayswater Mill was a working Mill  
until __1910______.Now it is being     
converted into a house.The new windows 
have to be kept in the same place      
identicle to the original windows.Where
the engine was is going to be a        
kitchen.Where the coal was kept for    
the steam engine a utility is going to 
be put there and above is going to be a
bathroom.The floors have holes in.They 
were chutes where we think corn was    
sent down.Part of the wheel was left   
When they make the stairs this will    
hold up the stairs.One of the beams is 
a tree.They are going to keep this     
there and use it as part of the hall.  
They are goig to do one bathroom,two   
bedrooms andthe kitchen so that they   
can move in. In the end there will be  
six bedrooms, two bathrooms, one       
living room, one kitchen and one       
utility room.                          </content>
