		<title>15LAMPLUGH DISABLED RIDING</title>
		<content> The Disabled Riders Club based at     
 Kerbeck Ponies, Felldyke has been     
 going for two and a half years. There 
 are three people who work full time   
 and six who work at the weekends.     
 There are about thirty disabled riders
 riding each month. The disabled riders
 are taken for rides around a field.   
 The disabled people really enjoy      
 riding because they are free to move  
 about when they are on the horses. The
 people from the club lift the disabled
 people onto the horses, some people   
 have to be strapped on. There are     
 twenty three ponies, the oldest one is
 Falcon who is fifteen. The disabled   
 riders come from Hensingham and       
 Distington. There are three other     
 Disabled Riders Clubs in the county,  
 they are at Kendal, Penrith and       
 Carlisle.
