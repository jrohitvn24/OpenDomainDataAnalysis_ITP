		<title>06Churches _ King's Worthy.</title>
		<content>  The earliest record of{St.Mary's     
{church, King's Worthy}was 800 years   
 ago. The church has been expanded and 
 remodelled many times since then. The 
 tower is 15th century.Today, sadly ,it
 is in danger of collapsing and        
 villagers are finding ways of raising 
 money for restoration, such as Fetes, 
 Flower Festivals and Jazz Bands       
 playing for special evening services. 
{St. Swithuns Church, at Headbourne    
{Worthy}is linked with St.Marys,       
 sharing the same vicar although it has
 its own Church Wardens.This is a small
 Saxon church, surrounded by fields and
 a small stream. However it is still in
 active use having one service every   
 Sunday and joining with St. Mary's for
 many activities.
