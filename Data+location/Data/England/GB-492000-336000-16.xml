		<content> The Belton district and its           
 surrounding lanes are especially      
 attractive to local runners.  Most    
 road and cross country athletes in the
 district will train or race over the  
 varied terrain.                       
                                       
 In the lankscaped park the soft       
 grassland, attractine tree lined hills
 and real country atmosphere make it   
 possible for the athlete to get right 
 away from the urban sprawl.           
                                       
 Around the Park the old drove roads,  
 once 4 gated to keep in animals, are  
 now throughways and tarmacadammed and 
 they too take the road runner to      
 splendid view-points.                 
                                       
 A number of local races have been and 
  are still being staged in the area.
