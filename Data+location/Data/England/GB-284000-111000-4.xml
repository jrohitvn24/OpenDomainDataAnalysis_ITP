		<content> The most recent census was in 1981. We
 now have 170 adults including 30 over 
 age 65 and 53 children. The largest   
 group is the professionals, including 
 lecturers, teachers, solicitors and   
 farmers. Financially these are        
 advantaged with good holidays and     
 choice of private health care and     
 education. Skilled people such as     
 mechanics, electricians and farm      
 workers have a comfortable style of   
 living with cars, entertainments and  
 annual holidays. The smallest group   
 consists of labourers and unemployed. 
 Unskilled, they have little financial 
 security and rely heavily on social   
 benefits.                             
 In general people live to about 80,   
 due perhaps to a healthy environment, 
 good housing and adequate medical     
 care. The few young deaths are caused 
 by accidents.                         </content>
