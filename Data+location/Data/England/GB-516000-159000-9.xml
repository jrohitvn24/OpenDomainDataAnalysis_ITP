		<title>09The Game Larder</title>
		<content> The Game Larder is a business that you
 would not expect to find so close to  
 the built up areas of Kingston and    
 London. Local game is caught and sold 
 from this farm shop.                  
                                       
{Venison}-Deer are shot in the         
 surrounding Surrey hills as are wood  
 pigeon, pheasant, partridge and       
 rabbit.  The latter are again becoming
 quite a problem in the area and       
 farmers are pleased that their numbers
 are being controlled. All the animals 
 are hung in the Larder, skinned and   
 sold mainly to private buyers and not 
 to restaurants as expected.           
{Trout}-About 2000 to 3000 trout are   
 kept in the two tanks again for sale  
 but these are not found wild but      
 brought from the trout farms..
