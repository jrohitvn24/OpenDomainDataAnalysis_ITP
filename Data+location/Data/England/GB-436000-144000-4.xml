     The population in Andover today is
 32,000.                               
     In Andover today I think there is 
 too much litter and dirt around the   
 town centre and there should be better
 shopping facilities.                  
     In Andover I think there should be
 more litter bins and posters which say
 throw your litter in the bin.         
     In Andover we have a good Sports  
 Centre and swimming pool.             
     On Saturday and Thursday we have a
 busy market.                          
     We have a museum in Andover and   
 they are building a new museum,next   
 door to the old one.                  
     In Andover we have a lot of ducks 
 because we have a lot of ponds and    
 rivers.
