		<title>13ST CATHERINE'S HOSPICE</title>
		<content> The Queen Mother laid the foundation  
 stone of this charitable hospice  in  
 1983. The Duchess of Kent is the      
 patron. It is a modern building in a  
 pleasing design. There are{28 beds    
 plus a certain amount of home care.   
 The patients all have terminal        
 cancer illnesses. They range from 21  
 to 94 years old. Their average length 
 of stay is about two weeks. During    
 this time, the staff help them to     
 adjust to their new treatment and to  
 face the future cheerfully. There are 
 no waiting lists and no fees to pay.  
 They hope to raise enough money       
 through appeals and donations.{For the
{year 1985-6 it will cost Â£530,000 to  
{run.}Ofthe{64}staff, 40 are full-time.
 There are also some volunteers. Their 
 cat,{Snoopy,}helps to cheer up the    
 patients and also helps to soothe and 
 comfort them.                         </content>
