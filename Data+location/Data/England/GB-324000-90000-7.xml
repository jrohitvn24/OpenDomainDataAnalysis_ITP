		<content>                                       
    Many years ago a railway came to   
 Seaton. Now it is closed down and     
 there is a{Tramway}which runs on those
 same tracks. It runs from Seaton's    
 Harbour road car_park on to the White 
 Hart Inn. Then the Tram runs up to    
 Colyton. The Tram runs along the river
 Axe, you can see a lot of Seaton,     
 Axmouth, the concrete bridge and all  
 the bird life of the River Axe. The   
 trip costs about Â£1.80 for adults     
 return, Â£1.30 for childrens return.   
 The Tram trip is very enjoyable for   
 photographers, bird lovers and even   
 for everyone who goes on the Tram.    
 There is a good range of Trams in     
 Seaton. The only other running Tram is
 in Blackpool.
