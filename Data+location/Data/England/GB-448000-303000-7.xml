		<title>07A Childs Day In Kirby Muxloe</title>
		<content> My radio alarm wakes me at 7.15 and I 
 check the time on the digital         
 timer.Then I get up, get washed and   
 dressed.I go down for breakfast, which
 is normally Weetabix, toast, and cream
 crackers. After breakfast I brush my  
 hair,clean my teeth and pack my lunch.
 Dad,who is a teacher,leaves at 8.00.We
 play until 8.30 and then we go to     
 school.When we get to school I usually
 go into my classroom for a few minutes
 and then go out to play with my sister
 and friends.At 9.00 the whstle goes   
 and we go inside.Today is Thursday,the
 best weekday.We finish off Fletcher   
 and reading and then go out to play   
 for 15 minutes.Then it is swimming and
 I am in the third group.Lunchtime is  
 from 12.00 to 1.30, I have a packed   
 lunch.After dinner it is art and      
 craft;we are making puppets.At 3.30 I 
 play on the park.Bedtime is 8.30.{Jane</content>
