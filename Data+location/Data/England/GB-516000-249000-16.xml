		<title>16SANDY SCOUT BAND</title>
		<content>   THE BAND I PLAY IN IS THE 1ST SANDY 
 SCOUT AND GUIDE BAND. WE MEET AT THE  
 SANDY SCOUT H.Q. ON FRIDAYS AND       
 SUNDAYS. ON FRIDAY WE GO INTO SECTIONS
 WHICH ARE PERCUSSION AT ONE END AND   
 TRUMPETS AT THE OTHER. ON SUNDAY WE DO
 DRILL WHICH IS MARCHING AND TURNING   
 AND THINGS LIKE THAT. I PLAY A        
 NON-VALVE TRUMPET IN THE BAND. WE     
 OFTEN HAVE VALVE TRUMPET PRACTICE.    
   PRACTICES START AT HALF PAST SIX ON 
 FRIDAYS AND AT TEN O'CLOCK ON SUNDAY  
 MORNINGS. WE SOMETIMES PLAY GAMES, AND
 WE HAVE BREAKS WHEN WE CAN HAVE TEA   
 AND ORANGE.                           
   WE PLAY ON LOTS OF OCCASIONS AND    
 ENTER LOTS OF COMPETITIONS.
