		<content> its first spraying of fertiliser and  
 perhaps reseeding will take place.By  
 now,the animals will begin to graze in
 the fields again.The parlour is  now  
 thoroughly cleaned out.               
   During the summer,two and possibly  
 three cuts of silage will be made.Also
 further sprayings of weedkiller and   
 fertiliser may be applied.By          
 autumn,the animals are beginning to   
 come in for longer periods as the     
 nights get colder.A finalcut of hay or
 silage may be made.The straw arrives  
 from Norfolk.                         
   Many of the fields in this area have
 old malr pits in them.Thhe origin of  
 these is not fully understood:they may
 have been dug out to obtain clay for  
 lining the canal or as samples for the
 pottery industry or to use on lighter 
 land to help hold the water.
