		<title>12BUCTON QUARRY</title>
		<content> Bucton Quarry has been carved out of  
 the top of Bucton Hill overlooking the
 Tame Valley. The scar on the landscape
 can be seen for miles around and has  
 been the subject of much local concern
 by environmentalists. Stone from the  
 quarry was used originally for dry    
 stone walling to mark the boundaries  
 of estates and to enclose pastures.   
 After falling into disuse it was      
 re-opened to provide hardcore for a   
 new runway extension at Manchester    
 International Airport. The hill is the
 site of an ancient monument, Bucton   
 Castle an early British settlement.   
 Local inhabitants in and around       
 Carrbrook village have expressed great
 concern over the large numbers of     
 heavy vehicles which reduce the       
 quality of life in this quiet corner  
 of Tameside.
