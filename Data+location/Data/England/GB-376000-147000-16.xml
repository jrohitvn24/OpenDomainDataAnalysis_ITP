		<title>16Why we like Frome</title>
		<content> We think that the best part of Frome  
 is the Sports Centre because you can  
 do lots of things there.   You can go 
 swimming, play squash,  judo,         
 football, tennis, rollerboots and     
 Badminton.   You can go up stairs     
 and watch the people swim.            
 You can go to the Victoria Park and   
 the adventure playground to play.   At
 the Victoria Park you can play on your
 bike.   From Frome we can go to       
 Longleat.                             
 Although Frome is quite a small town, 
 it has many interesting buildings  and
 shops, and it has its own football    
 ground and team.   We like the old,   
 narrow streets.
