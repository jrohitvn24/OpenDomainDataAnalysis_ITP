		<content>    There are only two big factories in
 our block, one is the brickworks and  
 the the other is the mill.            
   The{brickworks}is owned by Cheshire 
 Concrete but everybody calls it Ensor.
 It is down by the canal. There are big
 piles of sand and lime and other stuff
 on the other side of the canal and    
 they carry it over the bridge and     
 stick it all in a big machine. It     
 bakes the bricks so they are hard. It 
 is very noisy and dangerous.          
   The mill has been there a long time.
 It is called{Lea's Mill.}They get     
 grain,peas,molasses and beans and put 
 it in special machines that make it   
 into special foods for different      
 animals. The warehouse and factory    
 smells funny.                         
   Both factories take their products  
 away on heavy lorries and they make a 
 lot of noise and smoke.               </content>
