		<title>17HEALTH AND SOCIAL WELFARE</title>
		<content> There are no surgeries, pharmacies,   
 hospitals or clinics and villagers    
 must go to Bridge, Barham or Canter-  
 bury for health care. Doctors visit   
 patients' homes only in cases of ser- 
 ious illness. Hospital care, including
 maternity, is at the Kent and Canter- 
 bury Hospital. Dentists, too, are in  
 Canterbury. A monthly Baby Welfare    
 Clinic at Bridge and Barham, attended 
 by a Health Visitor and a Medical     
 Officer, operates an immunisation     
 programme. Home helps are available   
 through the Social Services, as is a  
 Chiropody Service. Community Nurses   
 and Health Visitors are attached to   
 surgeries and visit patients at the   
 doctor's request. The elderly and     
 mentally handicapped are able to go to
 Day Centres and Special Schools in    
 Canterbury. Meals on Wheels takes hot 
 food twice weekly to the housebound.  </content>
