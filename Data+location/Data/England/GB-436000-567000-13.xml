		<title>13THE NEW SOUTH SHIELDS METRO</title>
		<content>  The{South Shields Metro Station}was  
 opened in January 1984. The station is
 in{King Street}in the main shopping   
 area. The trains run every ten        
 minutes. Buses and the Metro system   
 are integrated so that people can     
 either get the bus to the Metro or the
 Metro to the bus. Fifty nine percent  
 of South Shields families use public  
 transport. The Metro is the           
 predominent provider of public        
 transport. Each day, 160 000          
 passengers travel on the Metro between
{South Shields, Newcastle}and{Whitley  
{Bay}and 70% of these make part of     
 their journey on the integrated bus   
 service.                              
 The Metro has made South Tyneside     
 public transport, of which South      
 Shields Metro Station is a terminus,  
 much more sophisticated.
