		<content>      The church St Bartholomew, shows 
 signs of a round arch dating from     
 1150 but there may have been a        
 building on the site in Anglo Saxon   
 times.A fine example of a chest       
 possibly used for collecting arms for 
 the Crusades is the oldest piece of   
 furniture inside the vestry.          
   The 16th century bridge at Habin    
 crossing the River Rother and the     
 Chithurst Manor monastery for         
 Buddhists are two attractions on the  
 border of the area surveyed.          
   A network of footpaths cross the    
 fields and woods making it a          
 singularly attractive place to walk   
 and enjoy the landscape and country   
 life. Roe deer from which the village 
 gets its name can still be seen among 
 the trees, all adding to this         
 friendly,beautiful environment.
