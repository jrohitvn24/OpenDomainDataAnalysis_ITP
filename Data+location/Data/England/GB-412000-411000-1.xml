		<content>   Honley is a large village, seven    
 kilometres south of the West Yorkshire
 town of Huddersfield. It is situated, 
 along with the neighbouring villages  
 of Berry Brow,Brockholes and Netherton
 in the valley of the River Holme. This
 is an extremely pleasant area with a  
 good deal of woodland and grassland   
 ideal for the rambler.                
   Job opportunities are confined to a 
 number of small factories. Much of the
 housing is privately owned, although a
 small number of council estates exist.
   The usual amenities are found:shops,
 schools,a sprinkling of non_conformist
 churches, and leisure pursuits, with  
 facilities for Cricket, Soccer, Hockey
 and Squash.                           
   Public Houses and clubs provide     
 social activities,whilst entertainment
 can be found at a few venues, most    
 notably at Honley's Southgate Theatre.</content>
