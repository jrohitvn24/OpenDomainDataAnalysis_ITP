Breach Lane used to be a road from     
Ramsden to Hailey and was wide enough  
for wagons to pass but now there is so 
much spooky undergrowth that the road  
is overgrown and is now a footpath.    
Barbed wire hangs off fences and makes 
them fall down.                        
                                       
Anyone can use footpaths and some are  
now bridleways were horses go. Walking 
is difficult because of mud, brambles  
and trees which over hang the path. As 
you hack away through the plants you   
get itchy and stung by nettles and     
thistles which grow to 150cm. Rabbit   
holes cause problems for people riding 
because horses hooves easily slip down 
the holes. We found the prints of deer 
and pheasant prints in the mud.
