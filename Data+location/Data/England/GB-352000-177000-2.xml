		<title>02LAWRENCE WESTON - THE PAST</title>
		<content> Lawrence Weston took its name from a  
 leper hosiptal that used to own lands 
 in this area. The hospital was called 
 St. Lawrence of Bristol. The earliest 
 evidence of human occupation in the   
 area is the remains of 2 Iron Age     
{Hill Forts}in the grounds of{Blaise   
{Castle Estate}and on Kingsweston      
 Ridge. Further evidence of early      
 occupation was discovered when the    
 area was being cleared for the        
 building of the estate in the 1940's. 
 The walls of a large{Roman Villa}were 
 uncovered and these may still be seen 
 today. Probably the most spectacular  
 historical building in the area is    
{Kingsweston House}designed by John    
 Vanbrugh. For a hundred years after   
 1833 the house was owned by the Miles 
 family. Today it is the headquarters  
 of the training branch of the{Avon and
{Somerset Constabulary.}L. W. School   </content>
