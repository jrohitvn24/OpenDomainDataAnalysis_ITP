		<title>18SHOPPING IN EPPING</title>
		<content> Epping is about to have its first     
{superstore.}Tesco's is opening in     
 October 1985.It will be 18,000 square 
 feet in size.There will be a bakery   
 department but very little home and   
 wear.Many shopkeepers fear{competition
 from a giant,but others think that it 
 will attract people to the town.A     
 survey conducted by class 5 ,Epping   
 Junior School,showed that shoppers    
 interviewed did not all live in       
 Epping,but came here to shop.Many     
 shops are coming and going.Old friends
 have gone.Will this stop? The best    
 known old friend to go is Woolworths  
 which closed in 1984 : many missed    
 it.(It was a handy shop for bits and  
 bobs.)There is a rumour that it is    
 going to be re-developed into smaller 
 units.In June 1985 an advertisement   
 appeared in local papers for{200 staff
 for the new Tesco's.                  </content>
