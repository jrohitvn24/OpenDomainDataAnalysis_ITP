 to be had locally,and coal for the    
 furnaces.Sand now comes by barge,lorry
 or train.Lime &amp; soda ash by road or   
 rail.Gas or oil are now the fuel 1700 
 people work in the 3 works,Gregg &amp; Co 
 and Rockware's Bagley and Headlands   
 Works.Business has been hit by the new
{plastic bottles.}The Rockware works   
 are quite big.But Greggs are just a   
 local company. Rockware make bottles  
 for milk wine whiskey and pop.The     
 factories look very dominating with   
 their tall chimneys.{"Gobs"}of molten
