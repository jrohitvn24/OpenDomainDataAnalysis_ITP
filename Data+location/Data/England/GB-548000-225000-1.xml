		<content> We visited Bentfield Bury Farm where  
 Mr Brett is the manager. We asked him 
 questions and this is the information 
 we received.                          
       The farm covers 750 acres. Ten  
 acres of the farm is woodland,in the  
 woods are oak trees. The pheasants are
 shot in the woodland. They get 500    
 bales of hay per year from the fields.
 Five acres will hold 238 ewes. The    
 ewes are out all the time, in all     
 weathers. Over last winter they lost  
 14 ewes so that they only had 224     
 ewes. On the farm they have  323 lambs
 as well. There are two unused pits.   
 They used to be used for chalk, but   
 now waste is put in them. The waste   
 comes from potatoes and sugarbeet.    
 They get 1,000 tons of waste per year.
       There are two ponds on the farm,
 they are used for putting out fires.  
 The fields have to be weed free as    </content>
