		<content> Only one tourist was discovered       
 during the survey. He was from the    
 Netherlands and was following Offa's  
 Dyke, an ancient boundary, along the  
 English / Welsh border. Local         
 inhabitants said that there were      
 many more{hikers}like the Dutch man   
 who followed the Dyke on foot. There  
 are no hotels in the area, although   
 one house provides a{'bed and         
{breakfast'}service and snacks for     
 hungry{campers.}In late June or early 
 July  a group of poor and under-      
 privileged children from Birmingham   
 come to camp in Pant-glas, faraway    
 from the busy city.{Local visitors}to 
 the area come for a quiet meal at the 
 restaurant near Rhydycroesau which    
 occupies a large house.
