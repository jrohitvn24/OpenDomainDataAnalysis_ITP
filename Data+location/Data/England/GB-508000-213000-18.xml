		<content>   Some local people were interviewed  
 to obtain their view of living in the 
 area and how it had changed over time.
   Generally, it was felt the area was 
 increasingly attractive because it was
 pleasant, had good communications,    
 education and leisure facilities.  The
 result was many new houses and high   
 prices.                               
   Traffic had increased enormously in 
 the area, especially at rush hour     
 times.  Villages had become larger and
 were losing their character.          
   However, most people were happy in  
 the area, most wives worked, at least 
 part-time, and many of them had       
 professional jobs.
