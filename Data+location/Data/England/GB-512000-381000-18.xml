		<title>18FARMING</title>
		<content>    One farmer runs a large flock of   
{sheep}on his land. He has three farms 
 which are worked as one large unit,   
 and several other isolated fields in  
 other villages. A large proportion of 
 his land is not included in this      
 block. The sheep are kept primarily   
 for meat, the lambs being a more      
 important crop than the wool. The ewes
 are kept on unimproved pasture near   
 the farm during the lambing season,   
 from late March to mid-April. They    
 later move to pasture further from the
 farm in the summer and autumn, but may
 be put to eat sugar-beet tops in the  
 early winter, before being moved back 
 near the farm, when their feed may be 
 supplemented with hay and concentrated
 food, depending on their condition and
 the weather. Some ewe lambs will be   
 retained, or fresh stock bought in, to
 keep the breeding stock healthy.      </content>
