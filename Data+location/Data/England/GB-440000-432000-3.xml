		<title>03PECKFIELD COLLIERY</title>
		<content> About a mile to the east of Garforth  
 near{Micklefield,}is the site of      
{Peckfield Colliery.}The site is at    
 the moment a rather ugly blot on the  
 landscape, with the{derelict}remains  
 of earlier activity. It opened in 1876
 and closed on the 21st of October     
 198O. There will be a demolition order
 on the buildings as they are unsafe.  
 At the present time men are sifting   
 through the rubble for usable {coal}  
 and then washing it. The mine was     
 closed down for the simple reason that
 it would cost too much{money}to       
 extract remaining{coal.               
 The shaft is 2OO metres deep and a    
{paddy train}ran from the bottom of the
 shaft up to 3 miles underground to the
{coal face.}Next to the mine are houses
 which at one time belonged to the     
 officials of the pit and some are     
 still occupied by former miners.      </content>
