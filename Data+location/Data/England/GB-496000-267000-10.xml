		<title>10SHOPPING IN HIGHAM FERRERS</title>
		<content>Most people think that Higham Ferrers  
and Rushden have a good range of shops.
Chelveston has only  one general store.
                                       
Many of the shops in Higham Ferrers are
centred on the High Street and Market  
Square. These are all very old         
buildings and so the frontages cannot  
be altered. This makes these shops very
attractive to look at.                 
                                       
The shops include a supermarket,       
hardware store, chemists, food shops, a
post office and several antique shops. 
There is also a cafe for people to     
relax in as they enjoy a refreshing    
drink.                                 
                                       
The shopping area in Higham Ferrers is 
always busy, even though it only       
attracts local shoppers.
