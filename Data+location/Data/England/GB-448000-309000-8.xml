		<content> Ginette and I started Guides at       
 different times. When I was enrolled I
 was scared.There was no need. The     
 girls made four lines and they walked 
 round until they formed a horseshoe.  
 Eventually we all stood still with the
 leaders at the front.I then stepped   
 forward with my patrol leader.The     
 leader asked me to say the promise: 'I
 promise to do my duty to God, to serve
 the Queen, to help other people and to
 keep the Guide law.' Then I was given 
 a certificate and told I was a        
 Guide.Guides  have challenges to do:  
 for example,enjoying the outdoors,    
 keeping fit, thinking for yourself,   
 giving service, exploring the arts,   
 becoming a homemaker, keeping the     
 Guide laws and getting to know people.
 We go to Guides on a Tuesday night    
 from 7.00 until 8.30.
