		<content> Most people in our area have cars     
 because{travelling can be difficult.  
 Local buses run just a few times a    
 day. From Pensilva there are only     
 three buses to Liskeard and one to    
 Launceston each day. There are no     
 buses on Sundays.                     
 The nearest railway station is in     
 Liskeard. From here you can travel to 
 Plymouth where you can get trains to  
 anywhere in the country.              
 You can see that{owning a car is      
{necessary}if you wish to do things    
 when you want to, like going to work, 
 shopping trips, visits to hospitals   
 and travelling for pleasure.
