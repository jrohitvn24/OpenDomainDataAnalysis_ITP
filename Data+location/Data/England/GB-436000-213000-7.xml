		<title>07Interview with local farmer</title>
		<content>On June 24th 1985 we visited a local   
farm. It is called Lower Farm and its  
owner is Mr. Butler. The farm has been 
in the family for 150 years but  Mr.   
Butler has only been working on the    
farm for 5 years. He owns 340 acres of 
land which is mostly arable. He grows  
wheat, barley and broad beans. He also 
keeps two bee hives. The farm was built
in 1740 but Mr. Butler mentioned that  
the house that was on the site before  
the farm was in the Domesday Book. In  
Mr. Butler's leisure time he shoots    
pheasants. His neighbours owned the    
rest of the land and they were         
hay-making. Mr. Butler owns two        
tractors and one combine harvester.
