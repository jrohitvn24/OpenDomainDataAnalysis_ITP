		<title>10HOUSING IN DRUIDS HEATH</title>
		<content>The {high rise flats} in which I live  
are  called Pleck House which is in    
Winterborne Croft in DruidÂ£s Heath     
opposite Walkers Heath Park.There are  
twelve floors and I live on the fifth. 
From my kitchen window I can see       
Walkers Heath Park and the fields      
which belong to Moundsley and Crabmill 
Farms.From the balcony I can see the   
Druids Heath  housing estate of        
{modern terraces and maisonettes}.We   
donÂ£t have milk delivered to our flat  
because the milkman doesnÂ£t leave any. 
It can be very noisy living here       
because of people around us.           
Our under floor heating is very good   
in Winter and in Summer we can use the 
electric fire if necessary.The lift    
only goes up to the 11th.floor this is 
because the mechanism is on the 12th.  
floor. It usually breaks down due vand-
alism.By Anna Coalter,Bells Farm J/I.  </content>
