		<title>14Princetown C.P. School</title>
		<content> There is only one school in the       
 village with 95 children on roll at   
 the moment. The children are aged     
 between 5 and 11 and arranged in four 
 classes. When they leave this school  
 they go to Tavistock Comprehensive.   
  Not all the children come from       
 Princetown. 13 children travel in by  
 mini-bus from Bellever and Postbridge,
 6 come from Hexworthy and 1 from      
 Merrivale.Sometimes in the winter when
 the roads are blocked with snow they  
 cannot come in  but this doesn't      
 happen very often.                    
  We have lots of interesting equipment
 we can use; two computers, a film     
 projector, colour T.V.,a video and    
 lots of gymnastic apparatus and a     
 swimming pool.My favourite lesson is  
 swimming which is essential on        
 Dartmoor as there are lots of rivers  
 to fall in.                           </content>
