 concerned for the preservation of     
{Broadway}as it was at that time.      
{The Civic Trust}was approached and    
 with its approval{The Broadway Trust  
 came into being. The source  of income
 is the subscriptions of the members.  
 Several prominent{Broadway}people were
 founder members of the Trust which    
 exists to promote and encourage high  
 standards of architecture, town       
 planning and landscaping. The         
 villagers are encouraged to preserve  
 the historical and rural character of 
{Broadway.}The Trust also exists to    
 forestall and prevent ugliness whether

 conservation area. The Trust owns land
