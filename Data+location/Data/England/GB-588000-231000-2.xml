		<content>    On the 25th of June 1985 a group of
 twelve children went to the mill.A man
 showed us around the mill and let us  
 try some Locust Beans.The mill was    
 built in 900 A.D. and was sited there 
 at the six foot drop in the river.The 
 first owner that the man knew about   
 was Witgar who was a Saxon.The mill   
 was first powered by water then steam,
 then gas,then diesel oil and then     
 electricity.The Mill used to have its 
 own power supply but does not any     
 more.                                 
    The mill grinds cereals and        
 minerals but the cereals the Mill     
 grinds the most are wheat,barley and  
 oats.The ground products go into      
 most countys in East Anglia and       
 are used for feeding animals.The      
 animals the meal is used for feeding  
 are cows,pigs,sheep,poultry,game,     
 horses and rabbits.                   </content>
