		<title>18TRANSPORT PROBLEMS IN BOURNE</title>
		<content>                                       
 Bourne is a market town and some of   
 the main roads are too narrow  and    
 twisting to cope with today's traffic.
   The articulated lorries often have  
 to run up the kerbs because there is  
 not enough room for them to turn.We   
 think a by-pass should be made to take
 the heavy traffic,like lorries and    
 caravans,away from the town centre.A  
 by-pass would mean that there would   
 not be so many{traffic jams}in Bourne.
 This year in Bourne there have been a 
 number of accidents caused by the     
 heavy traffic.                        
   We think Bourne should have more car
 parks. We also think they should move 
 the market stalls because they take up
 half of the road and cars have to     
 queue up.Burghley Street is another   
 narrow road and should be made a one  
 way street.                           </content>
