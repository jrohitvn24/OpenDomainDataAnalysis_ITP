		<content> Thirty years ago these farms had      
 flocks of sheep and cattle for        
 fattening,breeding or milk. But today 
 are almost entirely arable. Four      
 farmers have some sheep on the farm   
 for short periods, to graze on sugar  
 beet tops,rye grass or small areas of 
 grassland. On two farms there are     
 several horses.                       
 Cattle are grazed on Dam field Croxton
 (near to the pond and Pond Close Wood)
 and on a grass field at Grange Farm   
 Croxton.                              
                                       
 In the village of Kirmington, there   
 are three households who keep Goats,  
 and several keep bees.                
 There are two farmers wives who keep  
 50 to 100 hens,and sell eggs in the   
 shop or at Brigg market.There are also
 ten other famlies who have hens.
