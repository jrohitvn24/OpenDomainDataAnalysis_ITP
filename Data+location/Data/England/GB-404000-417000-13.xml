		<title>13ELLISTONE FARM - STAINLAND</title>
		<content>       Ellistone Farm keep two types of
 beef cattle. These are Herefords and  
 Charolais. The beef cattle are kept   
 separate from the dairy cattle and are
 kept just long enough to fatten them  
 up, then they are sold at local cattle
 markets.                              
      During the summer the farmer     
 is very busy making silage. He uses   
 one machine to cut the grass, and     
 another to scoop up all the grass     
 cuttings and blow them into a trailer.
 The trailer is then driven to another 
 part of the farm where the grass is   
 unloaded. The farmer then covers the  
 grass with polythene so that air can  
 not get in. In winter, when the cows  
 can't find any grass, they eat this.  
 To stop the cows from trampling over  
 all the silage the farmer uses an     
 electric fence. This doesn't hurt the 
 cows, it just makes them tingle.      </content>
