		<content>    In the Moore's household there is a
 ghost which is reputed to be the      
 spirit of Mr Moore's great great      
 grandad. It is said to haunt the      
 cellar at night.                      
                                       
    In Dorrington Wood many years ago a
 boy is said to have hanged himself    
 from a tree. No one seems to know why 
 yet, legend has it that his ghost can 
 be seen when the moon is full.        
                                       
    In Haverholme Park there is a      
 ruined priory , close to which is a   
 small bridge near an old barn.  A     
 strange tale is told locally of a     
 ghost which catches animals whilst out
 haunting and hangs them by their legs 
 from the bridge.
