		<content> SPENCER PARK                          
                                       
 Spencer Park has been there for ages  
 but it has had a few changes to make  
 the park a better place.  It has two  
 sets of swings and slides, one for the
 older people and one for the          
 youngsters so they do not get hurt.   
 There is also a cricket pitch.  In the
 First World War they used to have a   
 tank at the gate where you came in.   
 It was used for the children to play  
 on but in the Second World War it was 
 taken away, probably for scrap metal. 
 By the children's swings there is an  
 old road roller.  There is a bowling  
 green and tennis courts which are open
 most hours.  There is a bridge which  
 goes over a stream to get to a BMX    
 track which has just been built.
