		<title>05Manor of Spaunton Court Leet</title>
		<content> Mention is made of Spaunton manor in  
 the Domesday records of 1086.         
 Berringer De Toeni was the first      
 Norman lord of the manor which was    
 later under the care of St.Marys      
 Abbey,York until the dissolution of   
 the monasteries 400 years later.      
 The Darley family took posession in   
 1780 &amp; are the present owners. The    
 common lands within the manor cover   
 about 7000acres &amp; are mostly moorland.
 Although owned by the lord of the     
 manor (this is not a true peerage),the
 charter dictates that ownership       
 carries with it a right for registered
 commoners to graze their livestock    
 free of charge. The manor also        
 includes the villages of              
 Spaunton,Lastingham,Rosedale,Appleton-
 le-moors &amp; Hutton-le-Hole.
