		<title>01Verwood Village,Dorset.</title>
		<content>    Settlement in the Verwood area     
 seems to have started along the banks 
 of the River Crane which was probably 
 used for watering stock.Verwood       
 Village, Three  Legged  Cross  and    
 Romford  becoming  small  unimportant 
 hamlets on the out-skirts of Cranborne
 Chase.                                
    Most of the  earliest inhabitants  
 of the area would  have been farm     
 labourers although some of the        
 villagers had trades.Blacksmiths,     
 carpenters,shoemakers and thatchers   
 were found:basket and broom-makers    
 established their trades at Three     
 Legged Cross and potteries,making     
 bricks,tiles or pottery vessels grew  
 up around sources of local clay.      
    The oldest dwellings found in the  
 area are thatched cob cottages,their  
 white-washed walls built of clay,straw
 and gravel, perhaps 500 years ago.    </content>
