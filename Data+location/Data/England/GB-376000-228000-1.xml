		<title>01THE CORSE &amp; STAUNTON AREA</title>
		<content>  Our block lies about 7 miles North   
 West of Gloucester on the Ledbury     
 road. The land is fairly flat, the    
 highest point being only 60 metres    
 above sea level. Most of the land is  
 used for farming with dairy farming   
 the main activity. The land drains    
 into the Glynch Brook and then into   
 the small River Leadon which is a     
 tributary of the River Severn. The    
 main area of housing is at Snigs End, 
 lying half in Staunton and half in    
 Corse, which is where the Chartist    
 bungalows were built in 1848. This has
 become a Conservation area recently.  
 There are few fine buildings in the   
 villages but some of the isolated     
 thatch cottages are of merit. Staunton
 Court is  good example of a medieval  
 house with later additions. The       
 landscape near Down House is fine open
 typically English parkland.           </content>
