		<title>12BLACKBURN/PADIHAM LOOP LINE</title>
		<content> The{Loop Line}took eleven years to    
 build.  It should have been completed 
 by 1871 but due to the weather it was 
 finally finished at the end of May    
 1877.  Work carried on even though the
 Read and Simonstone residents         
 objected.                             
 The line was opened to goods traffic  
 on 1st June 1877 and to passengers on 
 15th October 1877. The line was mostly
 used by industry.  Due to the lack of 
 passengers the line was closed and the
 last train was on 3rd December 1877.  
 The line carried coal to the power    
 stations until November 1964.  All    
 that now remains of the railway is the
 raised embankment and some clinker but
 no sleepers or rails are left.  The   
 railway is now used as a footpath and 
 the verges are overgrown with grass,  
 flowers and trees.
