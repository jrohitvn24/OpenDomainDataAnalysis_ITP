		<content> In our area most of the farm land is  
 for cows and sheep but very few crops.
 The cows live in the lower lying      
 fields where the grass is better while
 the sheep manage on the higher or     
 rougher slopes where drainage is      
 poorer or the land is more exposed.   
 The crops that are grown are for the  
 farmers own use such as feed during   
 the winter months. The land does not  
 lend itself readily to growing crops  
 as it is too enclosed, too exposed or 
 too hilly.                            
 The cows are mainly fresians,         
 charolais and hereford. Some are used 
 for dairy farming and some are reared 
 for beef.                             
 The crops that can be seen growing on 
 a small scale are wheat, barley,      
 turnips and potatoes. The main crops  
 are used simply for hay and silage.
