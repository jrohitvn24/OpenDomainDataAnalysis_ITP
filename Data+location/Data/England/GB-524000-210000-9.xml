		<title>09My New House.</title>
		<content> When I was waiting to move I was      
 excited.I was waiting at the window   
 for the removal men to load the van.  
 When we arrived ,I helped them unpack 
 the things.I was pleased because I    
 didn't have to share a room with my   
 brother.My old house was a concrete   
 house.The kitchen has a lot of        
 cupboards.There are two toilets in the
 new house.The windows have metal      
 frames and good locks.They slide up   
 and down.                             
 When we moved to the new house the    
 gardens were all muddy and they were  
 split up with wire.                   
 There is a loft above the big bedroom 
 and the small bedroom.There are wooden
 frames to hold up the roof.There is   
 insulationin the loft to help keep the
 whole building warm.
