		<title>18The Museum:Chatteris(2)</title>
		<content>    Visitors to the museum have been as
 high as 650 in a year. This includes  
 private parties from outside Chatteris
 who can visit in the evenings. The    
 oldest exhibit is an axehead dating   
 from c300,000BC found at Blunt's Farm 
 near Manea. It is the only one of its 
 kind in the country and was perhaps   
 brought here by a hunting party       
 crossing to Britain when it was still 
 joined to mainland Europe.            
    Apart from the exhibits there are  
 also old maps, newspapers and tapes   
 with recollections of older residents.
 Members of the museum have taken part 
 in fieldwork and have noted that with 
 increasing farm mechanisation, people 
 are less likely to notice objects in  
 the ground. They also liase with      
 schools and the Women's Institute and 
 are invited to speak at meetings.
