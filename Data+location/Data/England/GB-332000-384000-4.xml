		<content> Two of the things I do in my spare    
 time are{dancing}and{Guides. }I have  
 two dancing lessons a week, one on    
 Tuesday and one on Saturday.  I have  
 my lesson at{The Civic Centre.} We are
 practising for our show, which we do  
 every year.  I especially like the    
 costumes we wear.  My favourite dance 
 is a rock and roll dance.  On Saturday
 I practise for my exams. {Guides}is   
 very interesting and we enjoy         
 ourselves.  We play{rounders}and many 
 other{games.} This is also on a       
 Tuesday, it lasts from 7.30-9.00 p.m. 
 and we also go camping.  We somtimes  
 draw and play with balls and{act      
{plays. }We enjoy{mimes}and plays and  
 we like having Christmas and Summer   
 Fairs, we especially like the         
 ploughmans lunches and cakes we have  
 at them.  At the end of a meeting we  
 sing{Taps,}a special guide song.      </content>
