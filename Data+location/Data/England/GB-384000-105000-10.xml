		<title>10Ecology: Bryanston Woodland</title>
		<content>                                       
   One of the striking features of the 
 ecology of the Bryanston area must be 
 the trees,the most renowned being the 
 massive{London Plane trees.}These are 
 situated on the west side of the river
 midway between St Martin's Church and 
 Blandford.The Guinness Book of Records
 measures them as being the largest    
 ever recorded.                        
   Also of note are the massive limes &amp;
 chestnuts which line the drive up to  
 Bryanston, &amp; are scattered through the
 grounds. There are also a number of   
 mature beech trees in the grounds.    
   In order to continue the tradition, 
 new planting of both deciduous and    
 coniferous types has been undertaken. 
 The major areas of Forestry Commission
 activity have been in Broadley Wood,  
 the Hangings &amp; Old Warren Plantation. 
   Walnuts give Walnut Avenue its name.</content>
