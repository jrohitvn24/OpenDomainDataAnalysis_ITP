		<content> from Headquarters in Worcester City   
 which are transferred to him through a
 personal radio or through a VHF radio 
 fixed to the car.                     
    Each month he has one weekend off  
 and in his spare time he likes working
 in the garden,watching T.V. and       
 reading .                             
    In his opinion a good Village      
 Policeman needs to have               
 patience,tolerance and an abilty to   
 listen to people's problems with      
 understanding.Above all he feels that 
 a good sense of humour is a great     
 help.
