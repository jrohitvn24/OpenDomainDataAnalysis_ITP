		<title>17Red Deer near Exford</title>
		<content> Red deer live on Exmoor,their fur is  
 reddish brown. In spring the stags    
 lose their antlers and when the new   
 ones grow they are soft like velvet.  
 The stags rubs the velvet off until   
 the hard horn shows.You can tell the  
 difference between stags and hinds    
 because only stags have antlers.The   
 stags fight to see who is the leader  
 of the herd. Red deer eat grass and   
 bark,sometimes they eat vegetables.   
 They are hunted because too many of   
 them would be a nuisance to farmers.  
 The meat is very nice, it is called   
 venison. When they are hunting, the   
 huntsman does not get confused if the 
 stag goes into a bunch of stags,he    
 knows it as it is the  hottest one.   
 Deer hooves have slots in them so they
 don't sink in boggy ground.
