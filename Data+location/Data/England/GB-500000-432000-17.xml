		<content>  Skidby Windmill is what is known as a
 Tower Mill. It has been restored so   
 that it is in perfect working order.  
 We are not quite sure the exact date  
 when it was built but the grinding    
 stones are French burr stones dated   
 1823. There has been a mill on the    
 site for several hundred years.       
  The present mill is unusual for      
 several reasons. Firstly, we know from
 old pictures that the mill and its    
 buildings have not changed for over a 
 hundred years. Secondly, the fantail  
 which keeps the sails facing the wind 
 is not the same design as other East  
 Riding mills. In a Tower Mill only the
 top of the mill turns to face the     
 wind. Thirdly, the top of the mill was
 raised to take the present sails which
 are bigger than the original sails. We
 think the wood used to raise the mill 
 came from the old Cottingham Low Mill.</content>
