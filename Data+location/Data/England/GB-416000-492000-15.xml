		<content> In our village, What have we got?     
 Starting the week, Church on Sundays, 
 Or Chapel for some. Then come Fun Days
 Toddlers going with their mothers     
 For a get_together with the others.   
 On Youth Club night _  Tennis and Pool
 It's their relaxation after school.   
 Ladies Keep Fit or join W.I.          
 They also enjoy a sing in the choir.  
 Weekly Whist seems to thrive          
 Or better still, a Domino Drive.      
 Quoits for the men with other clubs   
 Then some supper in one of the pubs.  
 Competing on Open Day for the Trophy  
 Women providing the afternoon tea.    
 In July the village goes gay,         
 Highlight of the year,it's Sports Day,
 Fancy Dress,Races,Raffle,Tombola stall
 A Disco at night to entertain all.    
 Six days a week we call at the shop   
 For bags of crisps or a bottle of pop 
 I can tell you _ WE'VE GOT THE LOT!   </content>
