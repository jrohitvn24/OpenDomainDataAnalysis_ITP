		<content> A 100 of the children at Clipston     
School were asked to fill in a         
transport questionnaire.  These are    
the results:                           
 94% of the children belonged to a     
family with a car. 57% belonged to     
families with more than one car.       
 70% of the children said their fathers
used the car to get to work. 48% have  
mothers who use a car to get to work.  
 36% of the children come to school on 
the school bus.                        
  6% of the children belong to families
who use the bus service regularly.     
 This questionnaire plus a local bus   
timetable proved to us that to live in 
a village like Clipston in the 1980's  
people needed a car, as to get out of  
the village using the existing bus     
service was quite difficult. The buses 
do not run very frequently.
