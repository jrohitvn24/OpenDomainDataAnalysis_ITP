		<content> A typical school day starts at 9 a.m. 
 with an Assembly when the children    
 have a short service and sometimes    
 show each other their work.           
 After Assembly the children usually   
 have a Mathematical activity for about
 40 minutes.                           
 After that they have a Language       
 activity such as Creative Writing,    
 Comprehension, Cloze Procedure or a   
 Discussion.                           
 The rest of the day can be spent on   
 wide variety of activities including  
 Topic Work, Art, P.E., Swimming, work 
 on the two Computers,  Country Dancing
 and Drama.                            
 Sometimes the children go on visits   
 often staying away for a day or two in
 hotels or on a camp site.
