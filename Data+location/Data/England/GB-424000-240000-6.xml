		<title>06FARMING AROUND SHIPSTON</title>
		<content>  The average size of the farms in the 
 Shipston-on-Stour area is about 250   
 acres.The{field}boundaries are mainly 
 hedges,but many farmers have pulled   
 out some{hedges}to make larger fields.
 The drainage is bad and some farmers  
 have under-drained.                   
  Twenty years ago,two-thirds of the   
 agricultural land was{grass}.Now this 
 is reduced to one third and the rest  
 is arable, mainly wheat.The other main
 crops grown are barley and rape.Beans 
 are no longer widely grown,they have  
 largely given way to oil-seed rape,   
 but there are still a few fields of   
 them.                                 
  There is a small amount of{beef}and  
{sheep}farming.                        
  On{dairy farms,}new breeds such as   
 charolais are becoming popular.Most   
 farmers buy and sell at Banbury or    
 Stratford{markets.                    </content>
