  We've also got a large greenhouse in 
 which we put tomato plants. Dad cut   
 the privet hedge and found a          
 blackbird's nest with some young birds
 in it so he had to leave it.          
  I helped my dad take our aviary up to
 our new house. You should have heard  
 the birds whistling in the car.       
  Dad said that I had worked very hard 
 and let me go to Sherwood swimming    
 baths with my sister's boyfriend Paul.
  When we got home, Paul helped me pack
 the last of my things , ready to move.
  On Sunday, I went to Langwith        
 Junction Club with my grandad and dad.
 I had a glass of shandy and played a  
 few games of pool. When I got home    
 I had my dinner which I really        
 enjoyed.
