 If we stand on Elizabeth Way, the road
 running along the north side of the   
 town through Little Parndon, and look 
 north across our area we can see the  
 valley of the Stort, the railway and  
 the A 414 road which connects Hertford
 and Chelmsford.                       
 The Stort was unnavigable until it was
 converted into a canal with a series  
 of locks, so that it was possible to  
 sail from Broxbourne to Bishop's      
 Stortford. The canal was opened in    
 1769 and is now run by the Stort      
 Navigation Company. When it was opened
 a number of malting and brewing       
 establishments grew up alongside the  
 canal. Nowadays most of the boats are 
 pleasure craft.
