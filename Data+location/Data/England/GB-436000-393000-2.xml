		<content> Fashion changes from month to month.  
 Fashion is influenced by music,the    
 trend towards fitness,being slim and  
 muscularity. Money also affects       
 fashion.Some clothing shops have had  
 to close down.Clothing is made from   
 natrual and man made materials.Animal 
 rights campaigners believe that skins 
 should not be used for clothing and   
 they protest outside shops which sell 
 the skins.You can no longer tell the  
 difference between animal fur and man 
 made fur.People like to belong to     
 groups like Headbangers,Pringles,Punks
 and Mods.They use clothing to show    
 people which group they belong        
 to.Football supporters wear their     
 teams colours and fans of pop groups  
 wear similar clothing to the bands.We 
 wear fashion because we like to look  
 good and not be left out by looking   
 old fashioned.                        </content>
