		<content> consists of small bungalows in which  
 sixty to eighty percent of inhabitants
 are of a pensionable age.  This large 
 elderly population inevitably causes a
 strain on the health and social       
 services which will increasingly      
 become a problem.                     
                                       
 The plan for population growth in     
 Frinton estimated that by 1981, 23000 
 people would be living in the         
 Frinton/Walton area, an increase of   
 17000 since 1961.  However this       
 planned growth has not been as        
 sizeable as was expected, with only   
 14,000 people in the area in 1981.    
 This, however, is only natural        
 population decline  which could have  
 been predicted.                       
 More than 800 Old Age Pensioners live 
 alone in this area, and out of 5677   
 elderly people, 2129 are over 75.     </content>
