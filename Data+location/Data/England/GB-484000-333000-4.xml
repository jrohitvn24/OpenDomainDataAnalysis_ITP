 The gentleman has lived there all his 
 life and the farm has been worked by  
 his family since 1902. The farmhouse  
 is a Grade II listed building. The    
 middle of the building is stone with  
 walls half metre thick. One room is   
 probably 300 to 400 years old. The    
 most modern part is 100 years old.    
 The front and back of the building is 
 brick with a slate and tile roof.The  
 floors are stone and wood.            
 On their land was the medieval hamlet 
 of Casthorpe known as a 'lost village'
 because no one lived there after the  
 Black Death. Farm machinery still     
 turns up stones from that time.
