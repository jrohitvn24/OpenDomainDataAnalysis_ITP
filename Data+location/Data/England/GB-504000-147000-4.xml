		<content>   The White Horse Public House makes  
 very much a central attraction in the 
 Square. It was built in 1500 and it   
 probably became an inn at the end of  
 the 17th century. Look out for the    
 stocks in the front garden, a fairly  
 recent addition.                      
   Pantrys is a 300 year old house in  
 Shere Square. It is called Pantrys    
 because Mr Pantry, who was the village
 Registrar of Births and Deaths lived  
 here at the beginning of this century.
 The house has been added to several   
 times and the outhouse is now being   
 converted into a breakfast room.      
   Opposite our school is Seaforth     
 Cottage which was built in 1632, more 
 than 350years ago,but it still looks  
 very much as it was 125 years ago.    
 Today Seaforth maintains its cottagey 
 style with a cobbled path and leaded  
 light windows and small doorways.     </content>
