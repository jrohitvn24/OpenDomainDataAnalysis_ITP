		<title>07Social Survey/Gt.Walding.</title>
		<content>  In a survey of which 35 people took  
part.Most people lived in a house      
built after 1945.They were mostly on   
the Alan Reason Estate.                
  Detached houses just came first with 
semi-detached houses a close second.   
Only about 1 or 2 children lived in    
bungalows,terraced and farm houses.    
  It seemed most people enjoyed living 
in Great Waldingfield.They said the    
people were friendly, there were       
good walks and lovely countryside.The  
people who disliked living there said  
that it was boring with no facilities  
and nothing to do.                     
 When asked in what way they would like
to see a change they suggested:a       
cricket pitch,more discos,tennis       
courts, swimming pool,more shops &amp; BMX 
tracks. At the time of writing an      
indoor   bowling green has been bought 
for the elder residents of the village.</content>
