		<title>02TOAT HOUSE, NORTH PULBOROUH</title>
		<content>  Toat House lies between the Toat     
 Monument and the River Arun. The house
 was originally a 14th century "hall"  
 house and the residence of the Lord of
 the Manor of Pulborough.              
  In the grounds of the house is a     
 chapel,formed from former outbuildings
 in 1900, in memory of the death of a  
 child of the family.                  
  Some of the estate of 300 acres was  
 orchard but these have now been       
 grubbed up and grass sown. The dairy  
 farm consists of about 100 Freisian   
 milkers and 100 followers. The owners 
 hope to breed Charollais cattle in the
 future.                               
  The owners also breed racehorses and 
 have five brood mares under the stud  
 name "MOORESTYLE".                    
  The estate includes Toat Wood, a     
 typical oakwood of mature trees which 
 is the haunt of badgers and foxes.    </content>
