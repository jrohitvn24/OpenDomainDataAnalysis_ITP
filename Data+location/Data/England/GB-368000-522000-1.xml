		<title>01DUFTON-BRAMPTON BLOCK</title>
		<content> In the NE of this block is a group of 
 hills at the foot of the Pennines     
 grazed by fell sheep &amp; beef cattle &amp;  
 home to a variety of wild birds.A row 
 of isolated farms &amp; cottages nestle   
 against the hills,overlooking the Eden
 Valley. Between here &amp; the river lies 
 Flakebridge Wood, once the pheasant   
 shoot in Appleby Castle Estate, but   
 sold to a timber merchant.The shooting
 rights are now separately owned. Some 
 deciduous trees have gone &amp; are       
 replaced with fir. Various small mixed
 farms occupy the remaining land round 
 the wood &amp; towards the villages of    
 Dufton &amp; Brampton, growing what crops 
 they need for their own stock.        
 The scattered buildings are of local  
 sandstoneor limestone. There is a     
 disused sandstone Quarry in Dufton    
 Ghyll,andvarious old limestone ones on
 the fell.                             </content>
