		<title>11Wimbledon Common (4)Environs</title>
		<content>The southeast side is boarded by a     
particularly pleasant area to live in  
with wide roads and expensive detached 
houses with walled gardens, a few with 
swimming pools. The owners walk their  
dogs on the Commons and ride horses on 
the cinder track and horse rides which 
criss cross it. Cyclists and walkers   
enjoy the paths. Heavy traffic during  
Wimbledon Fortnight at the All England 
Tennis Club makes the roads very busy. 
To the northeast there is an estate of 
high rise flats owned by Wandsworth    
Borough Coucil. There are very few     
local facilities. In Calonne Road there
is a Buddhapadisa Temple built 2 years 
ago in the grounds of a large house.   
Buddhist monks can be seen in deep     
saffron robes with their heads shaved. 
Visitors are made very welcome. There  
are no fences round the Common.
