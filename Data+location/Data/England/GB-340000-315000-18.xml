		<title>18FARMING CHANGES - MONTFORD</title>
		<content> Local farmers in the area remark on   
 how much the industry has changed in  
 recent years.  The greater use of     
 fertilisers, pesticides and           
 weedkillers, plus substantial         
 mechanisation, and a wide range of new
 land management techniques, have      
 considerably increased crop and animal
 yields.  Some argue, though, that the 
 increased production levels have      
 resulted in such surpluses for certain
 crops that their profit margins have  
 been drastically cut.                 
                                       
 Government, and especially EEC,       
 interference in the industry is       
 criticised by many.  In particular,   
 the difficulties and injustices caused
 by the newly introduced milk quota    
 system have caused much resentment.   
 Many are reducing their herds as a    
 result.                               </content>
