		<title>17Knowle High Street</title>
		<content>     Knowle High St. is quite a busy   
 high street. Still left on the High   
 Street are two inns:The Red Lion and  
 The White Swan. On the High Street    
 there are some very modern and slighly
 older buildings. Passing through      
 Knowle High Street every day are about
 500 cars and lorries per hour.        
      From the Churchyard you can see  
 the two inns. The White Swan has now  
 been converted into a bank and the Red
 Lion is a pub. You can also see the   
 Guild House shich is timber framed    
 and built in the 1400's. Also from the
 churchyard you can see: Covent        
 Garden,An Electrical Store, and a     
 Butchers. All those buildings look    
 quite old except for Covent Garden    
 which is a new building
