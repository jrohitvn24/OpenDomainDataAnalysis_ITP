		<content> The basin of Offenham which lies low  
 in a bend of the River Avon some three
 miles outside Evesham has good soil   
 for market gardening.  The land is    
 used intensively and a lot of land is 
 now under glass.  The land holdings   
 are not large but a produce market in 
 Evesham and a growers' co-operative   
 provide some of the various outlets   
 for the gardeners' produce.  The most 
 popular crops under glass appear to be
 lettuce followed by tomatoes, although
 the growing of courgettes and peppers 
 is becoming more popular.  The outdoor
 land is used to grow a mixture of     
 crops where radish, lettuce, cabbage  
 and spring onions are common.  Recent 
 developments in growing methods has   
 led to an increase in the use of      
 plastic tunnels.
