		<title>11Changing Times.</title>
		<content> The area is crossed by a ridgeway     
 which was an important route from very
 early times.Today it is almost        
 entirely residential. Elderly people  
 in this area were interviewed, one of 
 them, an old lady who had lived here  
 for 64 years.The greatest changes     
 most of them found, was the amount of 
 traffic along the main arterial roads 
 which tend to divide the area. Many of
 the streets contain terraced houses   
 built between  1860 and the start of  
 the century, but around the areas of  
{Stoke Hill, Hill Barton}and{Whipton}  
 are newer homes built since 1940. Most
 of that area was fields with farms    
 bordering the terraced houses.        
  Most of the elderly people felt that 
 the changes had brought improvement   
 and that the area was now a better    
 place to live in.(Ladysmith Middle    
 School).                              </content>
