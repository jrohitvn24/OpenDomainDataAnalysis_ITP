		<content> In our area we play lots of games.We  
 play 'CUT THE CABBAGE'.Three people   
 are needed then a certain area is     
 marked out.Two of the people hold     
 hands and stretch out and then another
 player cuts through the middle with   
 his hand.Both the players holding     
 hands run to their equidistant marks  
 and return.It is the first one back to
 their place,touches the cutters hand  
 and shouts "Cut the cabbage"that      
 becomes the winner.The loser now      
 becomes the cutter and the first      
 cutter becomes a racer.
