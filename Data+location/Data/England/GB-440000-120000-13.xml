		<title>13       Mobile Homes</title>
		<content> The Mobile Homes are situated off     
 Flexford Road. There are 50 homes on  
 the site which is owned by the Test   
 Valley Council. Owners pay rent to    
 them for the use of the amenities.    
                                       
 Each home has its own garden, number  
 and road name. No children or pets are
 allowed. Residents are elderly, mostly
 retired couples.                      
                                       
 The mobile homes last only for about  
 13 years before they begin to         
 disintergrate.                        
                                       
 There are at least 2 fire points on   
 the site.                             
                                       
 The site was well cared for with many 
 flowers and well tended gardens. Many 
 gardens had colourful garden gnomes.
