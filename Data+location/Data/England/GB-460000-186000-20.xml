		<content>The scientists from the Commonwealth   
Agricultural Bureaux hope to move into 
the disused junior school of Carmel    
College.The section would be the       
Institute of Biological  Control which 
would move from Ascot.By 1990 it is    
estimated that there would be 103      
scientists and senior managers.Plus 75 
support staff.{C.A.B.}would like to be 
in this location close to Oxford.If the
buildings at Carmel College remain     
enpty they will deteriorate.Planners   
object because it would bring too many 
people and demand too many scarce      
homes.It is argued that C.A.B. could   
recruit up to 50 staff,clerical and    
support,locally.
