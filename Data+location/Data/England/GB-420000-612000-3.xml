		<title>03RIVER SURVEY</title>
		<content> The river which flows through this    
 area is called{The Aln,}from the {    
{Saxon "alain"}meaning{clear.}We looked
 at a section of the river at{Peter's  
{Mill.}The birds we saw were mainly    
 swifts and swallows but there were    
 some coots.Most of the animals were   
 rodents;rats,water voles and shrews   
 and we also found a badger's          
 hole.There were many midges and       
 flies.On the river there were pond    
 skaters and water boatmen.In the river
 there were common leeches and we      
 discovered one{horse leech}and some   
 mayfly nymphs.There were lots of      
 sticklebacks with their young and a   
 few minnows.The river was very        
 clear,clean and seemed to be          
 unpolluted,so at this point at any    
 rate it is still worthy of its name.
