		<title>17RAF Base at Fairford</title>
		<content> In 1979 the American Air Force was    
 given the base in Fairford by the     
 Ministry of Defence.There are 1200 men
 stationed at the base.They remain     
 there from two to six years.          
   The base is like{a small town}and   
 contains many amenities for the sole  
 use of military personnel.These       
 include two gymnasia,an inter-        
 denominational church,a library,a     
 school and pizza parlour.Despite two  
 new dormitories there is still a      
{housing shortage}.Most of the         
 personnel live out side the base,and  
 travel in daily.                      
   Much of their work is centered      
 around the Fuel Tankers.The base      
 has one of the largest fire-fighting  
 machines in the world.
