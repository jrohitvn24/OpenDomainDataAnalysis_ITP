		<content> Mr.Toogood's dairy farm is between    
 Holly Well Lake and Langford          
 Budville.All his family have lived on 
 the same farm for 100 years. Mr.      
 Toogood owns 107 acres and he mainly  
 uses his fields for grazing. He only  
 has 85 cows and 30 calves on the farm.
 He gets about 1050 litres of milk. He 
 can fit eight cows in his milking     
 parlour but can only milk four at a   
 time with the Alfa Laval machine. He  
 puts his cows to the bull in the      
 spring. He sends his bullocks to      
 market and he rears only the heffers. 
 He has eight outbuildings and one     
 milking parlour.
