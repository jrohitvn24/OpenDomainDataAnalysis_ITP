		<content>  311 Tuffley residents answered       
 questions about their work.           
  The two largest groups were the 47   
 who do clerical work and the 40 shop  
 assistants. There were 16 engineers   
 and 14 mechanics. 12 are builders, 12 
 are teachers and 11 work in a         
 hospital. Among others, there are 4   
 hairdressers, 4 electricians and 3    
 working with computers.               
  There is therefore no dominant       
 employer or type of work. 60 of the   
 sample, represented 60 different jobs.
 These include a British Rail employee,
 a caretaker a casemaker, a fireman, a 
 milkman, a plumber, a school crossing 
 warden, a person engaged in looking   
 after the elderly, a vicar, a welder  
 and a wheelmaker.
