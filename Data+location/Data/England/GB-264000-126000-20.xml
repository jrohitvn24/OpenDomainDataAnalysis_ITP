 In the afternoon the time is spent on 
 project work, sports, swimming in the 
 school pool in summer, sewing and     
 reading.  Infant and lower junior     
 classes have a story read to them most
 afternoons.  In break-times at school 
 some of the children play in the field
 and some in the playground or they are
 all indoors if it is wet.  They play  
 cricket or football or play on the    
 climbing-frame, play recorders or do  
 gardening in the school garden.       
 In the evenings most children had a   
 cooked tea.  They played on their     
 bikes, watched T.V., played indoors or
 read in the evenings.
