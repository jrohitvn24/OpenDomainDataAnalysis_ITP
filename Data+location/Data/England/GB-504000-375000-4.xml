		<content>{Stainton-by-Langworth}is a small,     
 quiet village centred around a        
 square.Stainton is situated in the    
 north east corner of our D-BLOCK.     
 Stainton has a church called          
 St.Johns church.Some of the houses    
 in Stainton have been restored.Most of
 the houses are built in the local     
 stone or brick.The local brick is no  
 longer made, so when extending houses 
 it is hard to get bricks that match.An
 oil rig has now been built because oil
 is thought to be lying undiscovered   
 in the ground.                        
  Two years ago a coffin,thought to be 
 of the Roman period was discovered.The
 skeleton of a man was inside.         
  There are no shops in{Stainton }     
 although several of the farms sell    
 potatoes and onions when they have    
 been harvested.
