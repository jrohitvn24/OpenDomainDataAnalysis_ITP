		<title>16  THE TOWN'S ATTRACTIONS</title>
		<content> Many friends and relations come here  
 for their{holidays.}It is a good      
 centre for hotels,{sports}and{leisure 
 but few tourists use it as a centre.  
 The main attractions are the{historic 
{buildings;}the{castle}was among those 
 built by William The Conqueror soon   
 after the Battle of Hastings.It is    
 well preserved and we love the{view}of
 town and{countryside}from the top even
 though it's a hard climb up.In parts  
 of the town are remains of the town   
 wall,best seen in the{Southgate Arch }
 which once housed the South gate,then 
 was used as a prison,then as a museum 
 and now is an art shop.Our beautiful  
 priory suffered at the hand of Henry  
 V111's troops and stones from it can  
 be seen in some of Launceston's walls!
{St.Mary's Church}is renowned for its  
 carved granite(there being a sad cause
 for this)and its Black Prince tower.  </content>
