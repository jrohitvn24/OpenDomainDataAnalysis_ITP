		<content>{A day in my life cont.}               
 A peaceful lunch was followed by      
 reading a chapter or two from my book.
 I had made a chocolate fudge cake the 
 day before, so I spent an enjoyable   
 half hour decorating it as my birthday
 cake.This was much appreciated by my  
 children later and some of their young
 friends who delighted in the impromptu
 birthday gathering. By early evening  
 the aroma of the strawberries was     
 tantilising, so they were loaded into 
 the car and taken up to the school    
 where they were to form part of the   
 buffet supper at the school barn      
 dance. Our summer of 1985 will not be 
 remembered for it's dry warm evenings 
 but July 12th was one of them.What a  
 happy evening it was. We danced and   
 danced in the playground everyone     
 enjoying the relaxed and jovial       
 atmosphere before wearying homewards. </content>
