		<title>02The Hamlets are Shrinking!</title>
		<content>    The population of our area has been
 falling in recent years.For example,at
 Langford the{population was 163 in    
{1971 but fell to 136 in 1981.}        
 However,Last year four babies were    
 born in the village and this year so  
 far,three more have been born (up to  
 June).In the past ten years,only one  
 new house has been built in Langford. 
 At Ulting the population is down to   
 132.The northern part of Woodham      
 Walter falls in our area and a new    
 estate of houses has bought people    
 into the area but only three new      
 houses have been built in the past    
 four years and the village is no      
 longer growing.The other hamlet is    
 Curling Tye Green and two families    
 have moved into the area in the past  
 year and restored old farmworkers     
 cottages.
