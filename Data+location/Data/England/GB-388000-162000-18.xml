		<content>   The Christie Miller Sports Centre is
 situated at Bowerhill.  It opened to  
 the public on 6th January 1970.  The  
 building was already on the site, but 
 it cost Â£36,000 to buy, and the       
 alterations came to about Â£190,000.   
 Major S.C.Miller, whom the centre is  
 named after, was the chairman of the  
 council between 1963 and 1975.  The   
 centre has a large sports hall, and   
 facilities for squash, archery, rugby,
 football, indoor bowling, athletics,  
 golf, hockey and badminton.  They have
 over 2000 members aged between 4 and  
 89.  Members include the fastest man  
 over hurdles and a badminton champion,
 and many other title holders.         
   The centre has 38 staff; part time, 
 full time and casual.  It is open all 
 year round from 9am to 11pm.  It is   
 only closed for 3 days over Christmas.
