		<title>05FARMING PROBLEMS -NORTHWOLD</title>
		<content> The soil in the area is light and     
 sandy,consequently drought and wind   
 erosion are severe problems.To lessen 
 the effects of wind erosion,some      
 farmers spray their fields with       
 chemicals to 'seal' the surface.This  
 treatment will last 8-12 weeks.       
 The soil tends to be high in          
 phosphates and low in potash.Fertility
 is improved by adding various minerals
 and spraying with liquid fertilizers. 
 The summer of 1985 was wet and windy  
 with lower temperatures than usual.   
 This has made it a bad year for       
 farmers.One farmer estimated that out 
 of 120 acres of corn only 7-8 acres   
 remained standing ready for the       
 harvest - the rest was flattened by   
 the rain,hail and gale force winds.   
 Cereals have required more drying than
 usual which results in at least a 4%  
 weight loss.                          </content>
