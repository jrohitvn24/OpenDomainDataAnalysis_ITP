		<title>19TRANSPORT IN CHITTERNE</title>
		<content> The only public transport serving the 
 village is a single deck bus which    
 runs between the southern part of     
 Chitterne and Warminster, via Codford 
 on Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and      
 Saturday, leaving at 9.05 a.m.,       
 returning from Warminster at 11.55    
 a.m. On Friday there is an additional 
 service in the afternoon, leaving at  
 1.30 p.m., returning at 5 p.m. To     
 travel to other places connecting bus 
 services are available, though not    
 very frequent, at Codford and         
 Warminster. Anyone working away has to
 have their own transport, consequently
 many families have two or more cars.  
 Traffic problems through Chitterne are
 caused by heavy stone carrying lorries
 speeding through the village.
