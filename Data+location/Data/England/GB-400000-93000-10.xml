		<title>10Libraries on Canford Heath.</title>
		<content> There is one Public Library on Canford
 Heath with about 2O,OOO books in it.It
 has been open for     years.It is run 
 under the Dewey-Decimal system.There  
 is also a microfiche system which the 
 public can use when they want to find 
 more books and which library they are 
 in.The library is open on each day    
 except on Thursdays,Sundays and       
 Saturday afternoons.The library runs  
 quizzes and competitions which anyone 
 can join in with,as well as a special 
 story time for the younger children   
 visiting the library. There is always 
 a display of pictures by the children 
 from the local schools.               
 We also have a school library which is
 run the same way as the main library. 
 We borrow books from Dorset County    
 Library so we can increase the choice 
 of books.We can keep them for either a
 term or for several years.            </content>
