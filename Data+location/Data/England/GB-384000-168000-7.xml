		<title>076SU RUDLOE MANOR, CORSHAM</title>
		<content>    6SU is just part of RAF Rudloe     
 Manor's defence force. It moved to    
 Rudloe in 1977 and is at present used 
 as a communication post sending coded 
 messages to other bases across        
 Britain. It is made up of underground 
 tunnels so that it will recieve       
 maximum protection in time of war.    
  There are 8 working levels and a     
 recreation level. My dad was posted to
 6SU in 1983. He is a day worker which 
 means he works from 8.30am - 5.00pm.  
 There are also shift workers at 6SU   
 and they could work either from       
 7.30am.-7.30pm. Or from 7.30pm.-7.30am
 . 3 other members of my tutor group   
 have fathers in the RAF at 6SU, but   
 they are all shift workers.           
       In 1984 CND protesters broke    
 into 6SU because they objected to the 
 tunnels being used to start wars.
