		<content> LANDSCAPE &amp; BUILDINGS;FROG HALL 120 ac
 This dwelling was built by the owner/ 
 occupier about 20 yrs. ago. At first  
 glance one is struck by the many      
 windows, this is obviously home for   
 lovers of the countryside, sitting as 
 it does in an area of trees, 2000 +,  
 planted by the owner. Naturlising with
 the Pines &amp; Silver Birch which were   
 already present are Spruce,Firs,Beech 
 Larch, Magnificient Oaks,Scrub Oaks,  
 &amp; Chestnut to name a few. In September
 the Rowans were full of berries &amp; the 
 Buddleias full of flower. The R/Hand  
 side of the Hall is a grassed area    
 bordered by many plants including     
 Hostas,Heathers,Varigated Hollies,    
 more conifers and a Monkey Puzzle Tree
 The front of the Hall has a Lily Pond,
 flower beds &amp; lawns. There is an      
 avenue of trees which leads to the    
 conservation part of the grounds.     </content>
