Gayton village school was built in 1900
and dedicated to the memory of         
Cecil Eykyn who was a Captain in the   
Black Watch. The "Eykyn" name can be   
seen in many places about the village. 
At the moment there are 20 children in 
the school aged between 5 and 11.      
Three years ago there were only 8. Some
parents prefer to send their children  
to larger schools in other villages.   
There is only one full time teacher    
(the headmistress) and a part-time     
teacher for 1.5 days a week.           
Sometimes special teachers visit to    
teach music and science and art. The   
school has only two classrooms. The    
smaller is used for junior children    
when the second teacher is present.    
Although Northamptonshire opperates a  
3 tier School system, schools in rural 
areas have the Primary/Secondary type. </content>
