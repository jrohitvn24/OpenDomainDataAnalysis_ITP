		<title>03Hedgerows on Lound Farms</title>
		<content>Hedgerows are usually used to separate 
farms and fields in the Lound area. The
farmers questioned felt that they were 
the best method. Hedges are hawthorn   
and blackthorn. A good hedge is about  
1.5m wide and high,with few trees as   
roots take moisture from the land and  
cast shadows. The disadvantages of     
hedges are keeping them in good        
condition,controlling the hedges' wild 
-life which harms crops,and the amount 
of land they take. Mr. Hill,a dairy    
farmer,reckons hedges are ideal on his 
farm. They stop stock roaming,act as a 
windbreak for his stock and crops, and 
protect his fields against soil        
erosion. He has kept hedgerows because 
small fields of 7-9 acres are suited to
his farm. Arable farms require fields  
of at least 15 acres so that modern    
machinery can manoeuvre,so farmers have
felt it necessary to remove hedges.    </content>
