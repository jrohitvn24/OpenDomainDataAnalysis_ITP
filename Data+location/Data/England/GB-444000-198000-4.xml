		<title>04 50 YEARS AT GREAT PARK FARM</title>
		<content>     Mr. Binning first came to the farm
 in 1927.Since 1927 2 other local      
farms have been taken over,making      
about 600 hectares in all.             
     In 1927 EMPLOYMENT on the farm was
24 full-time workers,today there are   
only  6.Much less labour is needed now 
because of mechanisation.              
     MACHINERY has made the work much  
easier,yet wages are much higher       
(60-75p in 1927 and now over 100       
pounds).                               
     FARMING is bigger business now    
with more paperwork making an office   
and secretary necessary.               
     All lambing takes place indoors   
and the shepard can keep watch from    
home using a video.                    
     Today they do not produce any     
poultry and less beef cattle because   
they are less PROFITABLE.(Sarah
