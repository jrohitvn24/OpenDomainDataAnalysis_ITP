One of our first year junior classes   
visited two local bus companies,       
Beestons and Partridges, on Wednesday  
26th.June.                             
They operate a regular bur service     
every three days, to local villages,   
for shopping and visiting. (Eastern    
Counties operate a daily service.) Both
companies service their own buses.     
We met a bus from Rotherham in         
Yorkshire when we were looking at the  
Eastern Counties service timetable. The
people were on holiday at Clacton and  
visiting Hadleigh for the day.
