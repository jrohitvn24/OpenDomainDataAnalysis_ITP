		<title>03The Old Pier &amp; Quay.</title>
		<content>       Our area  has a derelict pier   
 called the Royal Pier. Parts of it are
 falling into the sea,and most of it is
 rotting.The Quay is used by{ferries   
{and hydrofoils}to the Isle of Wight   
 and many passengers come and go each  
 day to work in the city.Around our    
 area there are associated depots      
{shipyards}and storage areas.There are 
 the{docks}nearby,and a road           
  interchange.There is a Putting       
 course, just outside Mayflower Park.  
 Our square is mostly sea and mud      
 banks.The River Test runs by.There are
 watersports as well, and the Blue     
 Funnel{ferry}is nearby. There are     
 old unused railway lines which used to
 carry freight from the{Old Docks}to   
 the{New Docks}.There is a Corporation 
 Bus Interchange by the Town Quay      
  .From the Town Quay ferries cross    
 Southampton Water to Hythe.           </content>
