		<title>18Children's Adventure Week</title>
		<content>     In Children's Adventure Week we   
 have lots of fun. It costs Â£2.50 for  
 five days. It sounds expensive but it 
 is in fact worth every penny.         
     Throghout the week you go out on  
 Day Trips, for example last we were   
 all taken to St. Nicholas' Park, that 
 was fun. There is a swimming pool     
 there.                                
     We also went to the Cotswold Wild 
 Life Park last year. That was a great 
 trip out too.                         
     We play games throughout the week 
 like uni-hock. This is like hockey    
 with only six to a side. My leader    
 last year was Steven, he lives up my  
 road and I know him well. ({P.Stokes})
      This takes place during the      
 summer vacation to give children aged 
 8-12 something to do. It is staffed   
 and organised by adult volunteers.
