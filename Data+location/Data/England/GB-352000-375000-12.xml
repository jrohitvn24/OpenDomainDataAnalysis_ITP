		<title>12ST.LAWRENCE PARISH CHURCH 2</title>
		<content>  Every Sunday and throughout the week 
 people of all ages arrive to worship. 
 Some leave their cars in the nearby   
 car park, others walk. There are      
 usually 3 services- 8am Communion,    
 10am Family Service and 6.30pm        
 Evensong. A rota of volunteers look   
 after small babies to allow families  
 to attend. Sometimes there is a       
 visiting preacher.                    
  The nearby church hall is a lively   
 meeting place, daytime and evenings   
 and during weekends, for different    
 ages and interests. There are clubs   
 for older, retired people, young      
 families, Mother's Union, badminton   
 and bingo. Committees of volunteer    
 parishoners organise rotas for flower 
 displays, steward helpers, church     
 cleaners and various fund raising     
 events, for example, Christmas fair   
 and regular coffee mornings.          </content>
