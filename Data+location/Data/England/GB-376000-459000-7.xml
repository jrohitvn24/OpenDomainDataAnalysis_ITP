		<title>07Education in Rathmell.</title>
		<content>    For such a relatively small place  
 formal education has been part of     
 Rathmell life for over 300 years.     
    One of the village's famous sons,  
 Richard Frankland, founded {Rathmell  
{Academy in 1670.}It was the{first     
{Nonconformist Theological College in  
{England.}Some of the original         
 buildings may still be seen today but 
 they form a row of cottages.          
    As for the children of the locality
 records show that money was made      
 available{in 1716}for the local Vicar 
 to pay{a teacher,}who was required to 
{teach reading free of charge}but      
 pupils had to pay if they required    
 tuition in writing or accounting.     
    The{buildings}that are visible now 
 date back to{1875. Extensions}and     
 improvements were{opened in 1962 by   
{Lt.Col.Geldard}at a ceremony attended 
 also by the Bishop of Bradford.       </content>
