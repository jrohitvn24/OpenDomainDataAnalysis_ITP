		<title>08A SIKH TEMPLE IN SOUTHALL</title>
		<content> The{Sikh}temple is called a Gurudwara.
 There is one situated in Oswald Road. 
 It has a saffron coloured triangular  
 flag flying outside it. There is  a   
 sign called the{Khanda} on the flag.  
 The temple is spacious with decoration
 on the ceiling and the walls. The     
 floor is covered with white sheets on 
 which everybody sits crosslegged. The 
 men sit on one side and the women on  
 the other.  At one end of the hall is 
 the{Granth Sahib,}the Sikh holy book, 
 and everybody faces it. You enter the 
 temple barefooted and with the head   
 covered out of respect for the Granth 
 Sahib. Every temple has a communal    
 kitchen called{Guru Ka Langar.} Part  
 of the service is sharing a communal  
 meal.  Anyone and everyone who comes  
 has the right to partake in the       
 Langar.  There is one other main      
 Gurudwara in Havelock Road.           </content>
