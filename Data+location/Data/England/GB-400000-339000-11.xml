		<title>11New Tean Mill</title>
		<content>The brick building which dominates Tean
High Street has been called the best   
example of its kind in the country.At  
the East end is a black and white Hall 
dated 1613 which was taken over by the 
Philips family(see Heath House) when   
they brought the weaving industry to   
the area in about 1750. At first the   
Hall was the administrative centre     
only,with the spinning and weaving     
being done in the workers' cottages.   
Some of these cottages, although no    
longer used as work places,were in     
existence until 1966.When they were in 
use the family lived downstairs and the
workrooms were upstairs.The company    
started to expand the High Street      
Building westwards and in the 1820's   
steam driven looms were introduced,    
thus greatly reducing the work force   
but increasing output.
