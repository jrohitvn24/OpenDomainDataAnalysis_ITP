		<title>19The Severn Bridge</title>
		<content> The Severn Bridge is part of the great
 motorway system of Britain. It        
 carries, the M4, some  3,240 feet     
 across the Severn Estuary from Aust to
 a point near Chepstow in Gwent , at   
 approximately the same point as the   
 old vehicle ferry known as the "Old   
 Passage".                             
 The motorway at this point is two     
 lanes wide in both directions, but    
 frequent repairs often cause delay.   
 The toll gates are to be found on the 
 English side of the bridge. At present
 it costs 50p for a car to travel in   
 one direction. There are separate     
 lanes for pedestrians and cyclists.   
 The views from the bridge are towards 
 Berkeley and Oldbury to the North, and
 towards Avonmouth and Portishead to   
 the South.
