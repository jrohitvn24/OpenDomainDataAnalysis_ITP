		<content>{has kept to its old barns.Both farms  
{store their wheat,barley,hay,and sugar
{beet in these barns until needed.     
{  In connection with farming we also  
{interviewed the Gamekeeper to the     
{Fitzwilliam Estates situated in and   
{around our block.It is a full time job
{and he has to breed all the birds as  
{wild ones get killed by the chemicals 
{used on the land.Another nuisance to  
{the pheasants are passing             
{aeroplanes.Although these do not      
{bother most of the residents of Upton 
{naturally they can frighten the birds 
{until they are used to the noise.The  
{shoots take place 8 times per year in 
{the months of December and January.   
{  The birds are not troubled by       
{outsiders to the village.The          
{increasing number of ramblers always  
{stick to the marked footpaths and,in  
{most respects observe the Country Code</content>
