		<content>  We live in two villages in rural     
 Cambridgeshire called Steeple Morden  
 and Litlington.There is evidence of   
 occupation of these sites since Roman 
 times.                                
  Most children come to school in      
 Steeple Morden,the school has one     
 hundred and forty nine pupils.There   
 was a school in Litlington but it had 
 to close due to falling numbers.      
  Most of the land is used for         
 farming,the main crops are            
 wheat,barley,oilseed rape and sugar   
 beet.                                 
  Most people in Litlington work within
 the area but in Steeple Morden they   
 commute.                              
  In Steeple Morden there are two      
 shops,a Post Office and general store.
 In Litlington they have one shop      
 combined with the Post Office.
