		<content> The Bush Estate, the other principal  
 area of population, though at one time
 largly a holiday settlement, now has  
 several permnant residents, though few
 amenities and unmade roads.           
{ARCHITECTURAL MATERIALS}              
 The housing, in this coastal area of  
 Sea Palling and Eccles, varies from   
 traditional flint cottages with       
 thatched roofs, to recently built     
 bungalows and houses of factory-      
 made red brick and concrete roof-tiled
 construction.                         
 Some of the old cottages have had     
 their flint walls cement rendered and 
 colour washed, and where the thatch   
 has deteriorated, been re-roofed with 
 Welsh slate. There are also some      
 Victorian terraced villas of red brick
 which have slate roofs, and, closer to
 the sea, some sturdy houses of red    
 brick and slate.                      </content>
