		<content> Etwall has changed a lot, it used     
 to be a tiny village. It has not only 
 grown in the number of people but also
 in the number of buildings. There used
 to be only a few shops. Many things   
 you wanted to buy had to be obtained  
 from Derby or Burton. The houses have 
 changed a lot too. There were mainly  
 cottages and, if you were lucky,a farm
 which was usually passed from         
 generation to generation. The cottages
 have been pulled down now and replaced
 with a mixture of fairly modern       
 houses. People were attracted to      
 Etwall because each house had its own 
 water pump. The main road has always  
 been here but not so busy because     
 there was only the odd car the rest   
 were only ponies and traps. The old   
 railway used to work so people went   
 on holiday and day trips by train.
