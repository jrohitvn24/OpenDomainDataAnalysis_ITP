		<content> The landscape varies from the mainly  
 industrial area, along the Humber     
 Bank,to the village landscape which is
 a rural one of mainly agricultural    
 nature. The land is flat mainly arable
 with a few hedges and trees. Two      
 factories included in our plot are of 
 a very functional nature with little  
 thought given to architectural merit. 
 They both are concerned with a        
 chemical process and produce effluent 
 which discharges into the river and   
 the air. The rest of the buildings    
 include farm buildings which vary from
 the original construction of brick and
 pantile which blend with their        
 surroundings to modern construction of
 steel and asbestos cement sheeting.   
 The remainder consist mainly of       
 dwelling houses built of brick        
 and tile. Most fields have dykes      
 feeding into the river.               </content>
