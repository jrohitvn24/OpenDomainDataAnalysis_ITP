		<content> Knebworth Primary School is sited in  
 Swangleys Lane near the junction with 
 London Road. It is one of the largest 
 village primary schools in the country
 with 360 children between the ages of 
 4 1/2 and 11 years. The main part of  
 the building was built in 1912 and a  
 new infant block of four classes was  
 added in 1983. A further extension is 
 planned for later this year.The school
 has a heated outdoor swimming pool.   
 The Head teacher has 12 full-time     
 teachers working with him. Four       
 part-time teachers help with music and
 one other helps with reading. Two     
 welfare assistants help the teachers  
 and children in many ways.            
 The school kitchen cooks 190 school   
 dinners every day and also cooks      
 dinners for "Meals on Wheels" for the 
 elderly. 166 children bring packed    
 lunches to school every day.          </content>
