		<content> This area has been researched by 4    
 members of {Ovingham Womens Institute}
{Mrs.Pat Stott}coordinated the project 
 and did the writing up and computer   
 work.                                 
{Mrs Audrey Angus}drove us around the  
 area                                  
{Mrs Edna Baggaley and Mrs Judith      
{Montgomery}helped by giving me the    
 benefit of their local knowledge and  
 map reading skills on forays into our 
 area.                                 
 We now feel that our knowledge of the 
 area and its joys and problems has    
 greatly increased.I have also enjoyed 
 learning how to use a computer,and    
 have over come my fear of it.         
 The boundry of the area surveyed is   
 about 4 km.from{Ovingham.}I would like
 to thank the local population especia_
 lly the farmers, and my  husband{     
{Michael}who took the slides.          </content>
