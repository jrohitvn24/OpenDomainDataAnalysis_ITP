 throughout the summer months.People   
 come to Ilfracombe for many reasons   
 some may go to the beach and visit    
 surrounding tourist attractions.Older 
 people might like to enjoy the natural
 scenery and take walks.Younger people 
 can come and enjoy night-clubs and    
 pubs.Many tourists stay at bed and    
 breakfast Guest-Houses.Also there are 
 hotels,chalets,flats and nearby sites 
 for tents and caravans.People come to 
 Ilfracombe from all over the country  
 and use all sorts of transport to get

 coach.Once there was a railway which  
 was opened in 1874 and had a big      
 effect on tourism.But in 1970 the line
 was closed because it was considered  
 unprofitable and now the nearest line 
 is at Barnstaple.                     </content>
