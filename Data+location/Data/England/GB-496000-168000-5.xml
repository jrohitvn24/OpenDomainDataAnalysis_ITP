 so there is a different scenery and   
 the visitors dont get bored with the  
 same thing.The oldest tree in the park

 about 700 years and over.They charge  
 Â£1.50 for adults,Â£1.30 for a coach    
 load,Â£1.00 for old age pensioners and 
 children get in free .The garden is   
 open all year round even though not   
 many people attend the garden in      
 Winter.Many animals live in the park
