		<content> There are two watermills at Burton    
 Mill and Coultershaw.                 
 The former, built in 1784, is being   
 restored by West Sussex County        
 Council and is in commercial use. The 
 public may visit on certain days of   
 the week.                             
 At the latter site is an old beam pump
 engine which used to supply water to  
 Petworth. There was also a mill here  
 but it was burnt down in recent years.
 The site is now a listed monument open
 to the public during summer weekends. 
 Fishing permits are available for the 
 river Rother and for Burton Mill pond.
 Ramblers are well provided with foot  
 and bridle paths, and in summer a     
 special rambler bus, the 222 runs in a
 circular route from Arundel           
 station around the West Sussex region,
 stopping anywhere on demand. It only  
 runs on sundays and bank holidays.    </content>
