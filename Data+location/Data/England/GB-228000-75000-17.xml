		<content> In response to the 1st question about 
 the best features of living in this   
 part of Cornwall 50% said it was the  
 quality of the landscape and          
 countryside.45% said it was the peace 
 and quiet that the countryside        
 offered that was most important.      
 The 2nd question revealed that the    
 very qualities of life chosen in the  
 1st were the causes of the least      
 favourable aspects of living here.50% 
 said that isolation from people and   
 services were a problem.The other     
 responses were varied and included,   
 having to work away from home during  
 the week,too many holidaymakers,lack  
 of acceptance of new residents and    
 finally the creation of new housing   
 developments that do not tone into the
 existing landscape in terms of        
 materials used.
