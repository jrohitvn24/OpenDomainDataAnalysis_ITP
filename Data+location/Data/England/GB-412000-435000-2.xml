		<content> Religion in Frizinghall.              
 In Frizinghall nearly half the people 
 living there are Muslims.The children 
 sometimes find it difficult to mix    
 with white children because of their  
 race and religion even though they    
 were born in Bradford and are British 
 Citizens.Many houses have been made in
 to Mosques - any adult who is well    
 qualified and can read the Qu'ran (The
 Holy Book of Islam) can teach there.  
 When the children go home from school 
 they may eat a chappati or have tea   
 before going to Mosque. At Mosque     
 they remove their shoes then read the 
 Qu'ran,the teacher,Usta Ji,puts a tick
 when a child has finished reading.They
 sit on the floor for two hours,when   
 they leave backs and legs are aching. 
 No-one must talk in the Mosque.
