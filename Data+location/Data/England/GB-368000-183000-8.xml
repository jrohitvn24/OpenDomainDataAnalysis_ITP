 together.Two people stand at each end 
 of the elastic and a third person     
 jumps in and out of the elastic.{

 of other children.{Chase}:almost the  
 same as catch.{Skipping}:when one     
 child swings a rope over her head and 
 jumps over it when it touches the     
 ground.{Sevensies}:when you take it in
 turns to throw a ball against a wall  
 and catch it again in seven different 
 ways.{Creepmouse}:one person stands   
 against a wall with her back to the   
 others while the other children       
 creep up but when the other person    
 turns round they have to stay still   
 but if she sees someone moving she    
 sends them back to the beginning.Out  
 of these games{French skipping}is the 
 favourite.                            </content>
