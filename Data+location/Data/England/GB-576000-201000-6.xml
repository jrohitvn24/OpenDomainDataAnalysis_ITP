		<content> EAST HANNINGFIELD                     
{East Hanningfield} is a village,      
 surrounded by flat farmland, adjoining
 Bicknacre on its north-east boundary  
 and approximately 4 miles to the east 
 boundary of{Chelmsford.}              
 The population of 1000 has increased  
 by two-thirds during the last 4 years.
 Four new estates have been built in   
 discreet positions so as to preserve  
 the{old-world}look of the village.    
 The 100-year old{church}replaces the  
 Saxon one that was destroyed by fire  
 and stands on the main road at the    
 north entrance to the village.        
 The{Southend-Chelmsford}bus runs      
 through the village hourly,offering   
 regular transport for workers at the  
 small industries.                     
 There are 2 public houses,a modern    
 Church of England school, and a       
 popular post office and general stores</content>
