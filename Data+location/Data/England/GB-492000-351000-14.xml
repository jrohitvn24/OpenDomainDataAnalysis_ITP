		<title>14FARMING IN LEADENHAM</title>
		<content> There are eleven farmers involved in  
 the agriculture of this area.They are 
 mainly tenant farmers who lease the   
 Leadenham Estate.Farm workers are     
 usually accommodated in tied houses.  
 The soil in this area is of two types.
 The land on the Heath towards Sleaford
 is limestone based,drains well and is 
 easily worked.The fields towards      
 Newark,on the other hand,are heavy    
 clay based and require a great deal in
 the way of drainage and ditching.A    
 large part of the farming is arable   
 with only a relatively small area used
 for grazing.One farmer has a flock of 
 300-400 sheep.Most of the stock is    
 beef cattle,mainly Charolais and other
 continental crosses.Colonel Reeve is  
 the only farmer locally with a dairy  
 herd. This is a herd of Shorthorns,now
 quite unusual.
