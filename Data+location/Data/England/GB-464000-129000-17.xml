		<title>17Stride's Haulage - Ropley</title>
		<content> In 1969 our business began as a       
 piggery and agricultural contracting. 
 The agricultural side was soon in so  
 much demand that it completely took   
 over.We then had to supply our own    
 transport to move our materials about 
 the country as far afield as Royston  
 and Gloucester.We increased the number
 of lorries to 5 and a Unimog to cope  
 with the demand.This meant general    
 haulage was out and we concentrated on
 farming materials.We also store for   
 the farmer in order to spread at his  
 convenience.After running for nearly 7
 years there were new-comers to the    
 village who objected to the transport.
 After a public hearing by the Dept.of 
 the Environment we were granted       
 permission to carry on our business.We
 employ 3 of the family full-time and 5
 part-time lorry drivers. We spray and 
 spread for farmers both near and far. </content>
