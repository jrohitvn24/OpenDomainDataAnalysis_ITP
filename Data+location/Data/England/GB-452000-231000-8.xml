		<content> There are a large number of American  
 families living in rented houses in   
 the village, usually in small older   
 properties or on the Portway Estate.  
 The constant need for housing for     
 servicemen has created a market in the
 area for houses for well paid tenants 
 whose conduct can be assured by the   
 USAF authorities.  This need has been 
 exploited by those who purchase such  
 houses as become vacant, modernise    
 them and offer them for let.  The most
 direct result of such action is the   
 shortage of older houses for purchase 
 by first time buyers.  Another        
 disadvantage is that of having a large
 group of villagers whose social life  
 is focused on the base.
