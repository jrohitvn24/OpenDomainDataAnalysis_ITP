		<title>04Churches, Eaton B &amp; Edlesbor</title>
		<content> The village churches in Eaton Bray and
 neighbouring Edlesborough were both   
 built in the 13th century.            
    St. Mary's, Edlesborough has been  
 closed since the parishes merged in   
 1976. Built on an 'island hill', it is
 now in the care of the Redundant      
 Churches Fund. An annual service is   
 held, usually in July, when the church
 is decorated. Inside is a unique 'rose
 brass' and exceptional woodwork.      
    St. Mary's, Eaton Bray, serves as  
 the Parish Church for both villages,  
 with a congregation of 104. It was    
 built by William de Canteloupe in     
 almost cathedral-like style. Sir      
 Reginald Bray, from whom the village  
 takes its name, rebuilt the tower.    
    Three Methodist Chapels, a Strict  
 Baptist Chapel and Salvation Army     
 Corps each have small, but very loyal 
 congregations.                        </content>
