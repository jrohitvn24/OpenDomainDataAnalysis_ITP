		<title>11     KINGSWEAR CHURCH</title>
		<content> Kingswear church is surrouunded by    
 houses and the church is on the side  
 of the hill. It has a  small cemetery.
 The church  was built in 1170 They    
 think that before the church was built
 there was a chapel there. There are   
 two Naves in the church and a tower.  
 There is a clock and a belfry with    
 three bells. The belfry used to have  
 four bells but they sold one to pay   
 for a clock. It was sold in 1767. The 
 clock was given to the church in 1900 
 it cost Â£124.The organ which replaces 
 an old one at the west end of the     
 church was erected in 1916. It was    
 restored in 1959 at a cost of Â£500.
