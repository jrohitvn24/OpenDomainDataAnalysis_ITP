		<title>17Macclesfield- Relief Road.</title>
		<content>   Much argument has taken place over  
 the proposed route of Macclesfield's  
 Relief Road.One problem is where the  
 northern end of the road will finish. 
 There are two ideas as to where this  
 junction will be.                     
   The first junction would be at the  
 present junction of Flash Lane with   
 Manchester Road(the main road).       
   The second option would be for the  
 road to finish near Dumbah Lane's     
 junction with Manchester Road and     
 Heybridge Lane.                       
   People living in Prestbury and      
 Bollington will be especially affected
 by the outcome.                       
   Arguments are still continuing and  
 no final decision has yet been        
 made.Some people feel that the road   
 will be too late coming.Others believe
 that the arguments stop the road ever 
 being built.Time will tell!           </content>
