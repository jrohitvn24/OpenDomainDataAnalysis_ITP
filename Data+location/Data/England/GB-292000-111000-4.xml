		<content> A few of our class live in the        
 countryside in our D Block area.  We  
 are not all from farming families but 
 all enjoy living out of the town.     
 Sometimes we wish that we could get   
 into town more easily though as there 
 is little public transport and our    
 families often have to provide lifts. 
 Many of us enjoy pony riding and some 
 even hunt.  There are active fox and  
 stag hunts in the area.  There is a   
 kennels for fox-hounds at Hensleigh,  
 and the hunt often meets at the Rose  
 and Crown at Calverleigh which is just
 outside our area to the North West.   
 The Harvest Festival is still an      
 important time in our area and there  
 are many church services held over the
 harvest weekend as well as games and  
 Harvest Suppers.                      
 A very popular organisation in the    
 countryside is the Young Farmers' Club</content>
