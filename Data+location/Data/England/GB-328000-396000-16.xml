 inflated ball on a grass field.You try
 to kick the ball between two white    
 posts with a bar across the top so    
 scoring a goal.The team with the most 
 goals at the end of the match wins the
 game.A match usually lasts for ninety 
 minutes with a half time break at 45  
 minutes.There are 11 players in each  
 team, one of which is called          
 goalkeeper,the only player who can    
 handle the ball.You can touch the ball
 with head,foot,thigh and chest.A      
 referee controls the game,awarding    
 free kicks,penalties,corners or goal  
 kicks.A free kick is given when a     
 player has been kicked,tripped,blocked

 when one of the above offences has    
 been committed by a defending player  
 in the marked box before the goals.   </content>
