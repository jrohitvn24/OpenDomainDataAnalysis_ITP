		<content>  This area is not very {POLLUTED.}    
                                       
  Near  the two  farms it can cometimes
 smell. Outside houses there are drains
 which can smell and inside  there  can
 be all different kinds of food smells.
 Street cleaners clean the  drains  and
 pick up litter from the gutters. There
 are no large smelly factories in the  
 area.                                 
                                       
              {NOISE.}                 
                                       
  The main pollution is from {NOISE}.  
  Planes  fly  in  and  take  off  from
 Northolt airbase -  only  just  above 
 some rooftops.  Many  people  double -
 glaze their windows  to  keep  out the
 noise. Western Avenue is another noisy
 place. The traffic moves quickly on   
 its way into or out of London.
