		<title>01A country area</title>
		<content> This area rises from the flat meadows 
 by the winding river, past a sprea of 
 farms and cottages to the hills, and  
 up through scrubland to the open      
 heights, one of which has a           
 triangulation point 318m              
 It is cut by two roads on which buses 
 run, and many narrow lanes, often     
 leading to a dead end or track to a   
 farm. any houses are renovated nad    
 lived in by 'outsiders'.  There are   
 also a fair nummber of sites of       
 antiquity, a pond specially dug for a 
 trout farm, converted barns, a farrier
 and one farm building with  loot and  
 tower and prison cell
