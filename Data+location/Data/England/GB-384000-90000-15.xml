		<content> The Forestry Commission plantation at 
 Gallows Hill consists of 29 hectares  
 of coniferous woodland, 20 hectares of
 which were planted with Corsican Pine 
 in l96l. The other 9 hectares were    
 planted with Bishop Pine in l983      
 following devastation by fire. Both   
 crops will be thinned at 25, 30, 35   
 and 40 years, and final felling will  
 occur at year 50. By that time each   
 hectare will have produced            
 approximately 700 cubic metres of     
 utilisable timber at an approximate   
 value of Â£8,000 per hectare. After    
 clear felling the area will be deep   
 ploughed and replanted, so starting   
 the next rotation.
