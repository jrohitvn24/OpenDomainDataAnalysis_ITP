Lessons are from 8.45 p.m. to 3.15 p.m.
with an hour's lunch break.  A new     
system for school meals has been       
introduced called the "Star Choice".   
The children can chose between three   
main courses and three desserts.  The  
meals are served on moulded trays.     
                                       
In addition to the daily curriculum,   
children have the opportunity to take  
part, at lunchtimes or after school, in
the following activities:  country     
dancing, creative dancing, maypole     
dancing, recorder lessons, violin      
lessons, Brownies, choir, cycling      
proficiency, squash and occasionally   
tennis.
