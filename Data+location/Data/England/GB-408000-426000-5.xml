		<content> The animals that can be seen in the   
 fields are mostly domesticated animals
 such as cows sheep and horses. One    
 farmer also has some pigs in a field, 
 but most keep them in stys. There is  
 also one large poultry farm at{       
{Northowram}where most birds are kept  
 inside either in batteries or in deep 
 litter. The wild animals to be found  
 include, rabbits, hares and grey      
 squirrels,hedgehogs,fieldmice and     
 voles. There are also several foxes   
 but these are rarely seen, although we
 often see their droppings in their    
 sprainting places. There are many     
 birds to be seen in this area, but our
 favourite is the kestrel which hovers 
 over our school. There is also an     
 abundance of insect life, including   
 many varities of butterfly, and we    
 also have frogs breeding in our pond.
