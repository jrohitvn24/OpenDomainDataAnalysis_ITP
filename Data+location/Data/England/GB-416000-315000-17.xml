		<title>17Trent and Mersey Canal</title>
		<content>The main tourist facility in the area  
is the Trent and Mersey Canal.  This   
flows from north to south and encom-   
passes bridges 48 to 39.  At bridge 46 
there is a signpost giving distances.  
Shardlow is 23 miles and Preston Brook 
is 69 miles.  A survey was carried out 
during July and August to establish    
modern usage of the canal.  Most users 
were holiday makers in pleasure boats. 
Nearly all had hired re-conditioned    
canal barges.  Thirty nine boats were  
recorded.                              
After boating, fishing was quite a     
popular activity, then walking along   
the canal tow path and there was even  
one person feeding the ducks.  No      
swimmers were seen and no commercial   
barges were recorded.
