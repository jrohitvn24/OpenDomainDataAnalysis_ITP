		<content> Shawfield School caters for all age   
 ranges in its community-based         
 activities. There is a playgroup every
 morning and a mother and toddlers'    
 group twice a week in the afternoons  
 to cater for the youngest members of  
 our community. At lunchtime twice a   
 week the senior citizens come to      
 Luncheon Club. In the evenings and at 
 weekends there is a range of clubs for
 all ages, and there are often events  
 for handicapped people. In all these  
 activities the pupils of Shawfield    
 play a very active part, both         
 assisting others and participating    
 themselves.
