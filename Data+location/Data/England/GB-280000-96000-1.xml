		<title>01D BLOCK:GENERAL DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content> The land is mainly farming land,some  
 is for crops like wheat,barley and    
 corn or some fields might just be     
 resting.The rest of the farm land is  
 mainly for grazing-dairy and beef     
 cattle and sheep.The land itself is   
 fairly hilly and there are three      
 rivers,The River Yeo,River Culvery    
 and the River Ted.The woodland is a   
 mixture of coniferous and deciduous   
 trees-the main areas being Meetford   
 and Blackalder Woods.There are also   
 quite a few copses around.There are   
 hardly any houses,a few dotted around.
 The main hamlets are Venny Tedburn,   
 Uton and Posbury and Fordton.There are
 very few amenities in our area-only   
 telephone and postboxes (Crediton is  
 the main town that serves this area)  
 There is one railway line-Exeter to   
 Barnstable route.There are only three 
 churches in our block.                </content>
