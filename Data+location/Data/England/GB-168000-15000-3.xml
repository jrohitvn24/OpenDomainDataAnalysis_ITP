		<title>03Predannack Downs</title>
		<content> Some of Predannack is owned by the    
 National Trust and Hayle Kimbro Pool  
 and Ruan Pool are sites of Special    
 Scientific Interest.Hayle Kimbro Pool 
 is the largest of the serpentine pools
 and has a lot of marshland which has  
 many plants,dragonflies and birds.We  
 found a lot of the plant Ragged Robin.
 We saw the ruins of an old cottage    
 called Hervan.There are some walls    
 which are about one foot tall and it  
 was very small.On Hervan lane there is
 a tumulus at the top which was opened 
 by W.C.Borlase in 1871 and urns and   
 bones were found.                     
 We found out that on Predannack Downs 
 in 1755 Richard Chaffers discovered   
 china clay.It made pottery as good as 
 Wedgewood.It was sent by horse        
 and cart to Hayle and then it went by 
 ship to Liverpool.He did not make a   
 lot of money from his discovery.      </content>
