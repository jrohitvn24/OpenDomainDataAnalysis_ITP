		<title>08WILBERFOSS THE VICAR</title>
		<content>    The vicar has only just come to the
 village and is still settling in.  He 
 thinks the attendance at church has in
 creased since his arrival and is now  
 2/3 full on Sundays.  He thinks more  
 people would come if they could see   
 that the church is a caring place. By 
 the kinds of services and the words   
 used today he feels that the church is
 up to date.  He thinks there should be
 more links with the Roman Catholic    
 Church and also with schools. The     
 vicar, he feels, should visit people, 
 but he admits that he is so busy that 
 he finds this difficult. He likes     
 working and living in the village as  
 there is more chance of getting to    
 know people individually.             
    His favourite church feast is      
 Easter as he thinks it is the most    
 important in the Christian year. If   
 he wasn't a vicar he would be a doctor</content>
