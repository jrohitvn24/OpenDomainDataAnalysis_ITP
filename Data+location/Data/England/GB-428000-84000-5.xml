		<title>05NEEDLES LIGHTHOUSE  W WIGHT</title>
		<content>   The Needles lighthouse is very      
 important because it helps ships at   
 sea to find their way into and out of 
 the harbours of the Solent.It is very 
 tall and has red and white circles    
 round it.The lighthouse is always     
 occupied by 3 men who work for one    
 month at a time.They get to the       
 lighthouse by boat,unless the sea is  
 very rough when they use a helicopter.
 The colours of the light are red and  
 white,when the ships see the red light
 it shows that the ship is in danger so
 they must change course until they see
 the white point of the light.
