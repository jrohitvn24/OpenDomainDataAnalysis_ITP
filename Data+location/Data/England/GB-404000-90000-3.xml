 1. Travis Board; 7 years and 10 months
                                       
 I go to a BMX club on Saturdays and   
 Sundays.I have a mini Burner bike that
 can go fast over bumps. We have a     
 track that is about 400 metres long   
 and has about 10 bumps.One bump is    
 large and is called a table top.On    
 Sundays we have races with other      
 groups.I won a silver necklace when I 
 came first in a race.                 
                                       
 2 Gavin Pearce; 7 years and 10 months 
                                       
 I belong to the RSPB club.We go to the
 country and we go to woods and we go  
 out in boats to look for birds. I     
 usually go with my dad.
