		<title>14LIVING IN PILLEY</title>
		<content> I came to Pilley in 1946 and in a     
 short time knew everyone in the       
 village.They were mostly families born
 and bred locally and very friendly.   
 Some of the new people who have come  
 into the village have little interest 
 in local affairs and do not mix as    
 freely as when we first came. Enough  
 Council houses and private dwellings  
 have been built during the past 40    
 years but small, cheap houses are     
 needed for purchase by newlyweds so   
 that they may stay in the village.I   
 enjoy living here because it is quiet,
 a good distance from the main road,   
 within easy reach of the town,the     
 forest and the sea and people are     
 friendly. What else can we ask for?   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
