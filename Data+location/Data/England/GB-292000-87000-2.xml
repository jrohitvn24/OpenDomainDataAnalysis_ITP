		<title>02S.W. Water Sewage Works</title>
		<content> Built by and run by the South West    
 Water Authority, the present treatment
 works was built in 1971. An earlier   
 works was built here in 1933 on waste 
 marsh land. The site was chosen as it 
 is on low lying land suitable for the 
 sewage drains and it is away from     
 residential areas. (G.R. 947891)      
                                       
 There are 11 buildings on the site    
 including a laboratory, screen room,  
 main pumphouse, sludge and return     
 water pumphouse, cargo loading        
 pumphouse and workshop.               
                                       
 The works serve Exeter and the whole  
 of the surrounding region including   
 Topsham ad EXminster. After treatment 
 of sewage, treated water enters the   
 river and solids are taken by a       
 purpose built sludge vessel five miles
 out to sea or used as fertilizer.     </content>
