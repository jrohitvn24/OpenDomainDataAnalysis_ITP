		<title>04More Ecology-the Butley Area</title>
		<content>The area contains the Thicks, which is 
a primeval forest.                     
In The Thicks there were some signs of 
life,mostly Rabbits and Deer.We found  
woodlice in dead wood and spiders webs 
it was very interesting.There is a     
game keeper to keep down the numbers   
of vermin,and he keeps people out.The  
Forestry Commission land we did not    
see much wild life but mostly deer     
live round there.Near Butley creek     
there was a lot of bird life such as   
wood pigeons,Pheasents,Sparrows and    
blackbirds.Rabbits and Hares are       
mostly seen round there.Flies are      
attracted to the swamp lands and also  
small water insects.There is a crag    
pit which is a home for burrowing      
animals.In the water meadow we saw     
coypu traps.we saw some birds such as  
lapwings and duck.There were insects   
like dragonflies and gnats.            </content>
