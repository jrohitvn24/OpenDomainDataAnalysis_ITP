		<content> Carn Les Boel, the headland to the    
 south of Nanjizal has an island{bird  
{breeding sanctuary}close to the cliff.
 In the nesting season there are scores
 of{gulls, guillemots and shags nests  
 on it. In June, when we were there,   
 only about ten nests could be seen.   
 The baby seagulls looked just like a  
 little bit of fluff from where we were
 watching. Their mothers were very     
 careful not to knock them off the     
 cliff. They feed the young with fish. 
 The most interesting part was seeing  
{cormorants and shags diving}into the  
 water. In the sea just beyond the     
 sanctuary a big{grey seal}was swimming
 and basking in the sun.{Carn Les Boel 
 is known to RSPB members as a place   
{where migrant birds can be seen}in    
 spring and autumn as they reach land  
 after travelling across the English   
 Channel.                              </content>
