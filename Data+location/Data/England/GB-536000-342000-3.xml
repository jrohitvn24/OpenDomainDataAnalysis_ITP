		<content>   All of the land in our area was used
 for farming. There was hardly any land
 for industry.                         
   The land is almost all used for     
 crops. These crops include potatoes,  
 cabbages, sprouts and cauliflowers.   
 Also we grow wheat and barley.        
   Nowadays we grow a lot of oil-seed  
 rape because the Common Market pays   
 good prices for it.                   
   In October, there is the sugar beet 
 harvest and lorries take the sugar    
 beet to the factory at Spalding.      
   The only grassland is on the        
 re-claimed marsh and around some of   
 the large houses. Sheep are kept on   
 the re-claimed marsh.                 
    The school owns a patch of land    
 near the Hobhole where the Freiston   
 butcher keeps his animals.
