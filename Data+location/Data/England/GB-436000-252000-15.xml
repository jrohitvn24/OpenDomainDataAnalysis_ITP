		<title>15BADMINTON</title>
		<content>}One of the few organised sports in    
 our area is the local{badminton club. 
 It is held every Wednesday between    
 7 o'clock and 8 and about 25 children 
 aged between 8 and 12 attend.         
  {Badminton}is played with a badminton
 racket and shuttlecock.The idea is to 
 make your opponent hit the shuttlecock
 out of the court or under the net or  
 make the shuttlecock land on your     
 opponents side of the court.You can   
 play it in doubles and singles.When   
 you score you change sides. If you are
 on a even number you move to the right
 and if you are on a odd number you    
 move to the left.You can only score on
 your own serve it is the first player 
 to score 15 pionts.
