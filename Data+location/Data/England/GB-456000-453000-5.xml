		<title>05Clifton Junior School</title>
		<content> When the Primary School opened in     
 September 1930 it was almost          
 surrounded by pasture land and many   
 of the original 35 children came from 
 nearby farms.The school had 6         
 classrooms and numbers of pupils      
 rapidly increased so that 3 new brick 
 classrooms were built in 1937 and     
 between 1947 and 1966 8 prefabricated 
 classrooms were built. It was planned 
 that they would be used for three     
 years. They are still in use! The     
 numbers increased to about 600        
 children as new housing estates were  
 built in the neighbourhood after the  
 war. In 1979 the infant department was
 closed and numbers have dropped to a  
 total of 228 in 1985. Numbers are     
 bound to be affected by new housing.  
 Possibly a new junior school will be  
 within the Clifton area.
