		<title>10LOCAL TRANSPORT</title>
		<content> Public transport in Sunderland is     
 almost entirely provided by PTE       
 (Passenger Transport Executive) run by
 Tyne &amp; Wear Council.Services to       
 outside the Borough are provided by   
  Northen United and National bus      
 companies.One private company, W.H.   
 Jolly,operates a service between South
 Hylton and the town centre.Sunderland 
 is linked by rail to Newcastle,       
 Middlesbrough however this east-coast 
 line suffers threat of closure.It's   
 hoped one day that Sunderland may be  
 served by the Metro from Tyneside.The 
 road network in Sunderland is         
 constantly being improved.Main roads  
 radiating from the town centre are    
 dual carriageway where possible.There 
 are two ring-roads at present and a   
 third is planned.All transport in the 
 town requires access to a bridge over 
 the Wear.There are three road bridges.</content>
