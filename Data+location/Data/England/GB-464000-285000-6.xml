		<content> The A427 road forms the main street   
 along which most of the housing has   
 developed. The village consists of a  
 Church, a Chapel, a Village Hall, a   
 Pub, Shop/Post Office, 3 farms        
 on the main street and a further 75   
 houses, two thirds being owner        
 occupied. Most houses are built of red
 brick with slated roofs. A quarter    
 have blue brick patterning, typical of
 this area. One cottage has some mud   
 walls; one is half timbered, wattle   
 and daub, with a thatched roof. One   
 terrace is of brick with pebble       
 exterior. The Church is also an       
 exception being built of stone. One   
 house survives from C15 and 6 are C17.
 Eight were built between the early C19
 and 1837. But most of the dwellings   
 are Victorian and Edwardian. Only 20  
 houses have been built since World War
 Two.                                  </content>
