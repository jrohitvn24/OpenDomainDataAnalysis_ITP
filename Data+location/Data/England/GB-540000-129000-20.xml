		<title>20TRANSPORT, CHELWOOD GATE</title>
		<content> Two former turnpike roads run through 
 the area; A22 London/Eastbourne and   
 A275 Lewes road joining the A22 at    
 Wych Cross, a former turnpike, at the 
 northern end of the area. There are   
 also a few minor tarred roads and     
 various unmade tracks.                
 The only form of PUBLIC TRANSPORT are 
 buses running very infrequently to    
 E.Grinstead, Haywards Heath,          
 Uckfield, Thornton Heath, Brighton,   
 Worthing, Hastings and Eastbourne.    
 Due to the infrequency of the bus     
 ervices, particularly early morning   
 and evening and on Sunday, most       
 families own one or more cars as many 
 people have to use a car to travel to 
 work.
