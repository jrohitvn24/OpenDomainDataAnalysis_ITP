		<content>     The{Police Station of Williton}was
 built in 1858 and is still in use     
 today.   It is based in Bank Street.  
 The{Somerset Constabulary}was formed  
 in 1856 and by 1857 had 260 men.      
 The pay in those days was 80 pence a  
 week.                                 
     The Williton Police Station when  
 built had a{Court}inside and{stables  
 for the horses. There was also a{house
 for the inspector on the end of the   
 building. There were no{telephones   }
 until 1904. The{magistrates}came to   
 Court by{horse}and today the metal    
 rings are still there in the front    
 wall where they tied up the horses.   
     They had small{sub stations}at    
 Watchet, Kilve and Stogumber.         
    In{1968 a motor patrol car}was     
 based at Williton.   At about the     
 same time the Court was closed.
