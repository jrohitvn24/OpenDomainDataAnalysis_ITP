 This interesting old building is      
 situated on the main street of        
 Cropthorne and has rear views across  
 the valley of the{Avon.}It was        
 originally three cottages combined to 
 make a farmhouse in 1800. It had a    
 beautiful old fashioned English garden
 with tennis and croquet lawns. After  
 the 1939 - 1945  War the owner gave   
 the house to the{Diocese of Worcester 
 as a retreat and conference house.    
 Later it was extended and a chapel    
 added.                                
 In 1974 it was leased to an           
 Independent Trust and has become a    
 lively{Christian Centre}visited by    
 over 3000 people a year.
