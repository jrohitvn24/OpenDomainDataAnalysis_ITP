		<content>{St. John's Church,}Pensilva was built 
 in{1899}using money left in the will  
 of Archdeacon Hobhouse, Rector of St. 
 Ive. The mother church of St. Ive is  
 two miles away, and the building of   
 St. John's meant that the people of   
 Pensilva now had their own place of   
 worship. The church is unusual in that
 it is a sectional building of timber  
 and corrugated iron, with a stone base
 and porch. Inside it is beautifully   
 panelled in pine. It was purchased in 
 London for Â£198 and brought to        
 Pensilva by railway and then by wagon 
 and horses.                           
 The{Methodist Church}in Pensilva was  
 built in{1861.}It is a large building 
 with a Sunday Schoolroom at the back. 
 Two services are held each Sunday,    
 morning and evening, and the Sunday   
 School meets at 1100 hrs.
