		<title>08HIGHAM FERRERS' GOVERNMENT</title>
		<content>The local government in Higham Ferrers 
consists of a Mayor and 16 Councilors. 
It is their job to help solve issues   
which concern the local community and  
regular meetings are held to discuss   
current problems and ideas.            
                                       
The Mayor, who is elected for 1 year   
in office, is a very busy man because  
he works full time as well. However    
being Mayor can be very rewarding and  
a great honour. On the 3rd May 1985 it 
was the pleasant duty of the Mayor to  
welcome the Queen to Higham Ferrers.   
                                       
The Mayor is very concerned about the  
damage being done to the old houses in 
Higham Ferrers because of the vast     
amount of traffic which thunders past  
each day. Therefore the Mayor and his  
Councilors are pleased about plans to  
build the A45 bypass.                  </content>
