		<title>08The Lewes Ten</title>
		<content> that it was flat for about half a mile
 before the steep climb to Black       
 Cap.The track was full of loose       
 flints.From Black Cap we rejoined the 
 course about 5 miles from the finish. 
 We went down a steep hill.At the      
 bottom were very big chunks of mud.We 
 went along the edge of a corn field,  
 through two gates and up a steep hill.
 After that we went through a field and
 back along the track from Black Cap to
 the finish.                           
  At the start the the runners had to  
 line up according to their estimated  
 times of finishing.Refreshments and   
 changing facilaties were at our       
 school,the Wallands.                  
  There was a seperate race for under  
 16 boys and girls.It started 5 minutes
 after the Lewes Ten and was run over a
 3 mile course.Over 50 children took   
 part,including some from our school.  </content>
