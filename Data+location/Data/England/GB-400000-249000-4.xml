		<content>    The overall impression is of open  
 arable farmland with well managed corn
 production .There is some intensive   
 dairy production around Ab Lench and  
 grassland throughout the centre of the
 area and in the wetter land around    
 Whitsun brook.                        
    Much of the former fruit areas have
 been grubbed up though some plum and  
 pear orchards remain.The only market  
 garden to be seen, was in Church      
 Lench.Domestic gardens were of a high 
 standard of cultivation.
