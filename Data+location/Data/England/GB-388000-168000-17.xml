		<content> Lacock is a village full of history.  
 It is owned by the{National Trust}and 
 conservation is the main              
 preoccupation.  Little is allowed to  
 change or develop as it is the quaint,
 picturesque side of the village which 
 attracts the tourists.                
{Lacock abbey}is a must for all        
 visitors to the village.  This        
 proudly boasts the window which formed
 the subject of the first negative     
 taken by{Fox Talbot,} This connects   
 well with the neighbouring{Fox Talbot 
{Museum of Photography}which houses a  
 fascinating collection of old         
 photographs of the area.  Also of     
 interest in the village is a barn     
 which is believed to have been a{tithe
{barn}and most of the houses.
