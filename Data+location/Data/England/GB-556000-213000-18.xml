		<title>18Leaden Roding Police 1</title>
		<content> The Police Station in Leaden Roding   
 has been open since 1952. The function
 of the police is to get to know the   
 local people and to deal with any     
 local emergency, if it arises. There  
 is no official opening time. If the   
 P.C. is at home then he will deal with
 the problems. The P.C. has a Panda car
 and he also walks the beat. The area  
 covered includes, Leaden Roding, White
 Roding, High Roding, Aythorpe Roding, 
 Margaret Roding, Pleshy, Barnston, and
 High Easter, a total of 12 square     
 miles. Since January 1985 there have  
 been 30 different types of crimes. In 
 the Summer burglaries are more common,
 however in the Winter, farms have to  
 be watched more closely, to stop the  
 theft of Christmas livestock eg       
 turkeys, chickens and geese. On       
 average there are 1 to 4 phone calls  
 per day for the P.C. to deal with.    </content>
