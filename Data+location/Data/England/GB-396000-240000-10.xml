 Houses vary from timbered black and   
 white thatched cottages dating from   
 the sixteenth century to property     
 still being built.The older houses are
 mostly grouped around the centre of   
 the villages near the church.Some are 
 beautifully restored and all are in a 
 good state of repair.In Elmley Castle 
 there are 42 houses pre 1800, 15 built
 between 1800 and 1900, 29 from 1900 to
 1950, 50 from 1950 to 1970 and 59 from
 1970 to 1984.New houses both privately
 and local authority built blend in    
 well and are sited away from the main 
 village streets.Many council houses   
 have now been bought.There is an old  
 Romany family who have camped in the  
 area for forty years.
