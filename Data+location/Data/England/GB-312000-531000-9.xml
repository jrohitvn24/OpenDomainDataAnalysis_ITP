		<content> The old A66 has been existance since  
 1700. It was the main road to Keswick,
 and before that was a pack horse route
 for iron ore and wool into            
 Cockermouth. It was a country road    
 from Castlegate to Keswick. Like the  
 A595 to Carlisle it would have been   
 used initially by the mail coach,     
 farmers and private carriages.During  
 the early 1900's it was also used by  
 motor vehicles; increasingly after    
 1958 when Derwent school and the      
 housing estate were finished.         
   The use of the 'old' A66 decreased  
 dramatically in 1973 after the        
 completion of the 'new' A66 by-pass   
 which provides a faster route to      
 Keswick and the M6 in the east and    
 Workington in the west.
