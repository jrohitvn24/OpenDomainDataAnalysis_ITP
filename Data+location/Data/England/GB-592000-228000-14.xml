		<content>{Fifty years ago}in this area there was
 no main water.{Water}was taken from a 
{well}or some people had a{water pump. 
 Today everyone has a mains water      
 supply. There was no mains{sewerage,  
 the{lavatory}was in a shed in the back
 garden. It would be a bucket which had
 to be emptied in the garden. Most     
 people kept the same piece of ground  
 to do this. Today we all have either  
 mains sewerage or a septic tank. Mains
{electricity}was only in the centre of 
 the village and so people used a      
 boiler in their washhouse for washing 
 and an iron, which was heated on a    
 fire. Light was often supplied by     
{paraffin lamps.}Today everyone has    
 electricity and some houses have gas  
 supplies.{Heating}of houses was by    
 open coal fires. Today many houses in 
 tne area have central heating.
