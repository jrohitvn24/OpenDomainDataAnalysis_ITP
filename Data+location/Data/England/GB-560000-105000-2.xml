		<title>02A dairy farm</title>
		<content> Slyes farm is a dairy farm of about   
 160 acres with 80 cows.The owner's    
 father started the farm by purchasing 
 18 acres of land slightly higher than 
 pevensey Levels.                      
   The farm fronts onto a minor road   
 but behind the buildings the land     
 falls steeply away to Pevensey Levels 
 where most of the farms 160 acres lie.
   There are 2 employee cowmen.The herd
 is milked twice daily at 5am and      
 3pm.Daily yield is approximatily 240  
 gallons which is stored in a 400      
 gallon tank whilst awaiting           
 collection by the Milk Marketing      
 Board agent.                          
   Although the owner doesn't want to  
 give up his diary herd,E.E.C.quotas   
 arecutting his earnings.And           
 these regulations would prevent the   
 resumption of diary farming at a later
 date.                                 </content>
