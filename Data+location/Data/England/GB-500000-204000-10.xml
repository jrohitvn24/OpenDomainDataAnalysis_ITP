		<content>{Gade Spring Cress                     
 This business was started in 1860     
 around 20 years before the canal was  
 built.The beds used to be on both     
 sides of the canal but now they are   
 only on one side of the canal.The     
 cress is packed in unweighed bundles  
 that are harvested in April/May.After 
 pavking in boxes they are sent to a   
 London market.The present owners,Mr.  
 Mills and Mr.Smith don't know how much
 they grow because it varies each year.
