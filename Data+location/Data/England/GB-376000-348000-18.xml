		<title>18CHAPEL FARM</title>
		<content>Chapel Farm is ojne of the nearest     
farms to the school and is located on  
the road to Shraleybrook.The farmhouse 
was built in 1701 and it gets its name 
from the Methodist Chapel that used to 
be  next door but which is now used as 
a barn to store hay.The present owners 
have lived there for 23 years but have 
no children to carry on the work on the
farm.                                  
All the 50 acres are used for grass and
there are 36 milking cows and 19 young 
ones.The farm is the smallest in the   
area and is the only one which was not 
on land owned by Sir Thomas Boughey who
donated the land on which our school   
was built in 1849.                     
Chapel farm still has to employ a farm 
hand and the help of a local vet about 
once every 3 months to help the sick   
animals.
