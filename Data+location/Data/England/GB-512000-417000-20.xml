		<title>20General Description</title>
		<content> The area surveyed is basically low    
 lying clay and chalk and  is used     
 mainly for arable and mixed           
 farming.                              
        Although the character of the  
 area is rural the presence of the huge
 installations built by the oil        
 refineries that border the banks of   
 the estuary is a reminder of          
 industrial progress.It is unfortunate 
 that the companies cannot solve the   
 area's  high unemployment problem.    
      There are two small villages     
 enclosed in the area ;East Halton and 
 North Killingholme.The latter is      
 almost a hamlet,save for the church   
 and postbox.                          
      Despite the apparently good {    
{communications} offered by the opening
 of the Humber Bridge the village      
 remains comparatively isolated.
