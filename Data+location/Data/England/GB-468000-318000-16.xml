		<content>{ KEYRINGS}I have a collection of      
 keyrings.The proper name is keyrings  
 but some people call them key fobs.I  
 get them from places that I have      
 visited_mainly from France.I like my  
 keyrings.I make a cardboard cut out of
 a key and write on it where and when I
 got the keyring.I have some shelves   
 next to my bed.There are some supports
 to hold the shelves up,with some holes
 in.There I hang up the wire with the  
 keyrings on.When I get more keyrings I
 put them on other holes.I have been   
 collecting for a year.I have 345.

{CAR REGISTRATION NUMBERS}I like       
 collecting these.It is something to   
 do.I keep car numbers so that when I  
 am older and have children I will give
 them to my eldest child and hope they 
 will get more numbers.I have over 500 
 numbers.      Rebecca Stevenson       </content>
