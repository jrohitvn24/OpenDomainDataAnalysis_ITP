 Cathedral is named. During his 4 years
 at college, he learned{Hebrew and

 these languages. He also learned how  
 to hold a baby for a{christening.}If  
 the baby cries, he squeezes it in the 
 ribs so that it can't breathe. He     
 hands it back to the parents and when 
 people leave they say "Isn't he good  
 with babies!"
