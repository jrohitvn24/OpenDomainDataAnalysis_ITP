		<title>18Estate Agents - Buntingford</title>
		<content>  We visited several Estate Agents, to 
 find out about how houses are bought  
 and sold. W.H.Lee and Pat Whitacker   
 were very helpful. Although the kinds 
 of house they sell are slightly       
 different, we discovered that their   
 total yearly sales were similar. No   
 particular training is necessary to   
 become an estate agent.               
  The most popular kind of house, and  
 the easiest to sell, is the           
 three-bedroomed semi-detached kind.   
 The new estates in Buntingford have   
 contained a lot of these. At present  
 they cost from Â£48,000 upwards. A new,
 4-bedroomed detached house costs over 
 Â£80,000.                              
  The most difficult kind of house to  
 sell is a very old, very big and      
 dilapidated house.
