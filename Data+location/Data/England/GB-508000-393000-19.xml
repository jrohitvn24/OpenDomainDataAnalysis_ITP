		<title>19A DAY IN MY LIFE (Cont'd) 2</title>
		<content> Now my thoughts are with Katrina who  
 is being taken for an audition at     
 Oakham School by her grandparents. She
 hopes to study music there.           
 After lunch my first lesson was to a  
 small group of 16 year olds. I then   
 taught the book "Kes" to a 14 year old
 group. After school I took Emily to   
 her clarinet lesson. Returned home to 
 prepare a meal of roast beef,         
 Yorkshire pudding, sprouts and        
 potatoes, followed by peach pavolova. 
 Katrina and grandparents returned     
 home, we had a glass of sherry then   
 our meal. Time was away on business   
 but telephoned at 9 pm. The grand-    
 parents left and the children went to 
 bed. Before retiring myself I let the 
 pets into the garden and made         
 sandwiches for tomorrow's lunch and at
 10.30 pm retired to bed. {MRS. P. WOOD
