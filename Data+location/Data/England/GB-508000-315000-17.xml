		<title>17LAWRANCE PARK.</title>
		<content> In the entrance to the hall is aboard 
 that tells you when the hall was      
 opened and how it got its name.We use 
 the hall and field in the day and all 
 kinds of people use it at night and at
 the weekends.Monday night is Youth    
 Club.I go to that.Tuesday is Ladies   
 Gym.Wednesday is Badminton and Friday 
 is Cubs.On Saturdays and Sundays the  
 Football and the Cricket Clubs play on
 the field.People have parties dances  
 discos and wedding parties there. My  
 mum is in the W.I.and they have a big 
 Art and Craft competition in September
 and there is a part for children.The  
 best part of the park are the swings  
 and slides and things to play on.It   
 was good in the infants because when  
 we came out of school mum would let us
 go and play on them.A Lot of people   
 take dogs for walks round the park.
