		<title>15An Adult's Day,Gotherington</title>
		<content> Each morning everyone is woken up by  
 the radio followed by the kettle.About
 ten minutes later Dad goes into the   
 bathroom to wash etc.Fifteen minutes  
 later Dad comes out and gets dressed, 
 says good bye and goes to work.Dad    
 drives in to the Eagle Star car       
 park and then goes upstairs and       
 switches on his flex clock.He then    
 takes a note of jobs to complete and  
 looks at his diary.Then there may be a
 meeting with project leaders or       
 sometimes with user department whose  
 computer systems Dad looks after.At   
 lunch time Dad gets a partner to play 
 him at squash. When the game is over  
 Dad has his lunch and starts the      
 afternoon which goes by much the same 
 as the morning.At the end of the day  
 Dad goes home, the time he leaves     
 varies.Later he sometimes goes out but
 often stays in to watch television.   </content>
