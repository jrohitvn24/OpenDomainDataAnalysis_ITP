		<content> Newlyn Fishmarket is one of the       
 main sources of work in the village of
 Newlyn.Also it is the fourth biggest  
 fishing port in England.There are     
 around 160 boats that work to catch   
 the fish.The main source of fish in   
 1982 was mackerel and it was over     
 3,000 tonnes.But over the years the   
 number of mackerel has gone down      
 dramatically.All types of fish are    
 caught - white fish,oily fish and     
 shell fish.It is auctioned at the     
 market and goes all over Britain and  
 across the channel to other European  
 countries.                            
 Penlee Quarry overlooks Newlyn        
 harbour.Blue Elvan is quarried here   
 this is used to surface roads and is  
 used here and abroad.Stone boats call 
 at Newlyn. {
