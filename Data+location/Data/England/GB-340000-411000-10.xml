..........................             
It was July 14th, 1985 and today I was 
going to Chorley with the rest of      
Rufford Morris Dancers for a large     
competition.The bus was meant to pick  
us up at 10.55 but, as usual,it was    
thirty minutes late .After the bus had 
picked up me and all the other         
girls,we set off for Chorley.We got    
changed on the bus into our parade     
costumes and then we were dropped off  
at the start of the parade .We then    
had our dinner before we went to the   
arena.We danced at 4.25. We danced for 
fifteen minutes while being            
judged.Then after all the other troops 
had danced we lined up to see if we    
had been placed.We came first.We got   
home at 8.55.I watched a bit of "Live  
Aid",but I was to tired to watch it    
all and fell asleep.                   </content>
