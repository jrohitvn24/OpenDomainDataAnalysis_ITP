		<title>18HEALTH : CHERRY WILLINGHAM</title>
		<content>   There is a community health centre  
 in Cherry Willingham which is on the  
 'Parade'. It has five doctors and a   
 community nurse. It also dispenses    
 medicines because there is no local   
 chemist. Two doctors are on duty at   
 any surgery because the practice also 
 takes in the health centre at         
 Nettleham. There is also a small      
 surgery at Reepham.                   
   The main surgery is open for five   
 mornings a week and recently the      
 surgery has started opening on two    
 evenings a week (4.00pm-6.00pm). At   
 other times patients have to go to    
 Nettleham which is open all day.      
   Doctors normally see people by      
 appointment but it is possible to see 
 the doctors without an appointment.   
   Lincoln is the nearest hospital. It 
 is 4km. away and without a car can be 
 difficult to get to.                  </content>
