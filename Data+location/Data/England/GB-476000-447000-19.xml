 Village life for home-owner's usually 
 means gardening, one section flowers &amp;
 grass,usually at the front, vegetable 
 plot and fruit trees &amp; bushes at rear.
 There are local shows for the         
 dedicated home-gardener, and in these 
 days a deep freeze is as important as 
 an oven, fruit and vegetables being   
 grown for immediate use and to freeze.
 Many homes have open coal fires and   
 many use an Aga Cooker. Men keep alive
 skills like Wood-turning &amp; Carving.   
 The women do their own laundry, make  
 preserves, bottlefruit, do the        
 freezing,knit,sew,crochet,make lace,  
 spinning, breed dogs.Cake Stalls &amp;    
 Coffee Mornings are held to raise     
 funds for the Church and charities.

 wine using wild flowers and berries.  
 Root vegetables are also used.        </content>
