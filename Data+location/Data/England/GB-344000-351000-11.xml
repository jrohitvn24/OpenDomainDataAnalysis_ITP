		<title>11TRANSPORT IN TILSTON</title>
		<content> As Tilston is a rural village most of 
 the villagers have to rely on their   
{own transport}for gettimg about. Most 
 families have a car. There is also a  
{public transport bus}that takes people
 to the neighbouring towns of{Chester, 
{Wrexham, Whitchurch and Malpas.       
 School-children either come by car or 
 bike to Tilston school. Older children
 have a special school bus to go to the
 Bishop Heber High School. Adults who  
 are employed, travel to work by car. A
 bus shelter is going to be built near 
 the Fox and Hounds. Little traffic    
 goes through the village. At certain  
 times of the year the village is      
 active with farmers using their       
 tractors. Many children and locals use
 bikes for going around the village.   
 A  helicopter often lands near the    
 village and we are on a flight path   
 for Manchester airport.               </content>
