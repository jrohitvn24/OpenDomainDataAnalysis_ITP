		<content> WE START WITH FARMING AS THIS IS RURAL
 AREA. THE MAIN CROP IN THIS BLOCK IS  
 CEREALS THE FARMERS CAN GROW TWO CROPS
 OF CEREAL ON THE SAME PEICE OF LAND IN
 THE SAME YEAR.THE OTHER CROPS THEY    
 GROW ARE SUGER BEET,CABBAGE,BRUSSEL   
 SPROUTS,ONIONS,PEAS, POTATOES, AND    
 CAULIFLOWERS. THE FARMING IS INTENCE  
 BECAUSE THE SOIL IN THIS AREA IS VERY 
 FERTILE ITS FORM IS SILT LOAM.MOST OF 
 THE SMALL FARM HOLDINGS HAVE GONE     
 NOW,ALL THESE FARMS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT 
 OUT AND ARE OWNED BY BIG GROUPS.THERE 
 IS NO DAIRY FARMING IN THIS AREA NOW  
 BUT OCCASIONALLY SHEEP ARE BROUGHT    
 INTO THE AREA TO FEED FROM FIELDS     
 WHICH HAS HAD BRUSSELS PICKED FROM    
 THEM AND ONLY THE STORKS REMAIN. THE  
 SHEEP ARE KEPT IN BY AN ELECTRIFIED   
 FENCE RUN BY A SMALL BATTERY. THE     
 FENCE IS PORTABLE AND IS EASY TO MOVE 
 AND ERECT.                            </content>
