		<title>20Bassingfield Riding Stables</title>
		<content>    Mrs. Thomas owns a riding stables  
 in the tiny hamlet of Bassingfield.   
 She has lived there for 28 years.     
 There is just one full-time and one   
 part-time person to help Mrs. Thomas  
 to run the stables. They look after   
 the 22 horses which are stabled there.
 People can go to ride the horses or   
 they can have riding lessons if they  
 are only just learning how to ride.   
 Lessons cost Â£3 an hour. People can   
 ride in some of the nearby fields or  
 along the country roads through the   
 area.
