 SANDS COURT.This is a large grey stone
 house built in the C18th as a dower   
 house for the  Codrington family.Stone
 lions guard the entrance to the       
 house.In the front living room is a   
 small narrow window, called a squint. 
 From here one can see a wall in the   
 garden which divides the garden into  
 two lawns.In the wall is another      
 window through which one can see      
 straight through to the second lawn   
 and to the greenhouse, this device was
 used by a suspicious owner of the past
 to see what his gardener was doing!   
                                       
  The house has its own electric       
 generator for use in emergency,       
 particularly in Winter when it is     
 often snowed in.
