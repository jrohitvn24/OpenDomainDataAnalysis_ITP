		<content> The Church of England church, standing
 near the village green was consecrated
 in 1222 and is dedicated to{St.George 
{of England. }It owes its present form 
 to the Peyvres, great church builders 
 of the parish, who lived at Wadlowes  
 near Toddington. The church, built of 
 Totternhoe stone, has a ninety foot   
 centrally placed tower which houses a 
 peal of eight bells.                  
{Interesting features}include a three  
 storey parvise, a fifteenth century   
 water stoop, medieval wall paintings, 
 carved wooden decoration on the roof. 
 The south and north transept chapels  
 contain the tombs of the Peyvre,Cheyne
 and Wentworth families.               
 Today the Rector is resident in the   
 Leighton Rd. Rectory. Church services 
 are taken twice daily every weekday,  
 Holy Communion, Family Eucharist and  
 Evensong conducted on Sundays.        </content>
