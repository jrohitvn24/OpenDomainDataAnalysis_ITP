		<title>02SOUTHBOURNE IN THE PAST</title>
		<content> 1925                                  
 In Southbourne during 1925,people did 
 not buy so many things in the shops as
 now but would order them.The houses   
 would be made of bricks which mainly  
 came from the brickmakers in          
 Southbourne.Gas and electricity were  
 being installed at this time.In New   
 Road there was a pump to get water    
 because people had no water supply of 
 their own.                            
 1945                                  
 The roads were unmade and muddy.Trans 
 port was a train every hour and a bus 
 every half hour and cars.             
 1965                                  
 In 1965 a lot of houses were built and
 the muddy roads were replaced with    
 Tarmac ones.In 1970 it was decided to 
 build a village hall.It was completed 
 in 1972.                              
                                       </content>
