		<content>A large percentage of the working      
population is in full time employment. 
Many commute to work as few jobs are   
available locally. Most popular        
hobbies are gardening, reading, sewing 
and DIY.  A small survey revealed the  
diverse interests.  Distances from     
ready-made entertainment and sports    
centres mean many pursue hobbies at    
home, such as music, knitting and      
computer programming.  Group activities
encourage singing, lace making and     
cycling.  Spectator sports and         
swimming interest  many.  Unusual      
interests are sheepdog breeding and    
trials, clock repairing and            
parachuting. One lady races formula 3  
cars.
