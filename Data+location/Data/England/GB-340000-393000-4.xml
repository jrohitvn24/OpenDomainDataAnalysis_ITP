		<content>   I go to Croxteth Carnival nearly    
 every year. I usually enter the Fancy 
 Dress Competition.   There are always 
 lots of activities there like the     
 lucky dip, fancy dress parade, and    
 choirs singing. Before it begins there
 is a walk around Croxteth.   In 1981  
 there was a bus that had books in that
 you could read, and I won the Fancy   
 Dress competition.   I was dressed as 
 Queen Elizabeth the First, and I won a
 little silver cup. It said on it "1981
 Fancy Dress Competition."   On the    
 stalls are clothes that people have   
 made and knitted and on others are    
 food.  Some stalls have games. I think
 it is very good.                      
   At the{Hey-Day,}which is held in the
 grounds of Croxteth Hall, there is a  
 fair, and some stalls. There is a     
 bar,too, where they sell beer &amp; lager.
