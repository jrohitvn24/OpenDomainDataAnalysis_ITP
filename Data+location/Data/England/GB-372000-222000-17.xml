		<content> DAIRY FARMING - (CONTD FROM PAGE 16)  
 The working day on a dairy farm       
 generally begins at about 5.15 a.m.   
 The first job of the day is to bring  
 the cows into the milking parlour for 
 milking. The time needed for milking  
 depends upon the size of the herd and 
 the capacity of the milking machines. 
 The milk is stored in large metal     
 containers where it is allowed to cool
 until the milk lorry comes to take it 
 to the dairy. As soon as milking is   
 over the parlour is cleaned out and   
 then it is time for breakfast at about
 8.30 a.m. The rest of the day is spent
 doing routine work around the farm,   
 until about 3.00 p.m. when the cows   
 need to be milked again. Neither farm 
 delivered milk to local customers,    
 that was left to the milkmen. The     
 price of milk is governed by the      
 European Economic Community.          </content>
