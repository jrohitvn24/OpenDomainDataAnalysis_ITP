		<content>                                       
 As this is a very rural area there is 
 very little opportunity for recreation
 but we do have some facilities such as
 the football field in Welford where   
 the local village team play. There is 
 also a Cricket Club which plays at    
 Grafton Court. A more peaceful sport, 
 fishing, is done on the Avon at       
 Welford and clubs come from Birmingham
 and Redditch to fish there. There are 
 also boating facilities at Welford and
 a number of boats are moored up river 
 from 'The Four Alls'. Many holiday    
 barges go along the river in the      
 summer. Temple Grafton and Binton both
 have Village Halls which are used by  
 the Womens Institute and Snooker      
 Clubs. Discos are also held there     
 every now and then.
