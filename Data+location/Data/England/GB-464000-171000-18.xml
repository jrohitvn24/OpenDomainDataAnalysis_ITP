		<content>    Whilst it is true to say that most 
 people do have television sets,and do 
 spend a great deal of time watching   
 various programmes,it is probably true
 to say that more people are turning to
 things in which they can take part.   
    This may take the form of going out
 to play cards or games with friends,or
 joining various kinds of clubs.Many   
 middle-aged people go out to play     
 'Bingo' at proper bingo halls.Most    
 Calcot people travel into Reading to  
 do this,but some enjoy playing at the 
 local school or church hall.          
    Here is a list of activities under-
 taken by local people:-chess,board-   
 games,fishing,guitar,walking,home-    
 computers,football,tennis,squash,model
 making,gardening,birdwatching,sailing,
 swimming,badminton,martial arts,      
 reading,going to the cinema,theatre,  
 discos,and so many more!              </content>
