		<title>19INFLUENCE OF THE COTSWALDS</title>
		<content>  THE AREA COVERED IN THIS BLOCK IS A  
 VERY RURAL ONE, WITH FEW FACILITIES OR
 AMENITIES, BUT THE MAJORITY OF THE    
 POPULATION ENJOY THE QUIET LIVES THEY 
 LEAD. A CAR IS OBVIOUSLY A NECESSITY  
 FOR MANY OF THESE PEOPLE, AND LOCAL   
 GARAGES PROVIDE GOOD SERVICE.         
  THERE ARE MANY MORE ELDERLY PEOPLE   
 THAN ANY OTHER AGE-GROUP, AND MOST    
 HAVE LIVED IN THE AREA ALL THEIR      
 LIVES, AND DO NOT WANT TO MOVE. THERE 
 IS NO EVIDENCE OF NEW BUILDING        
 ANYWHERE IN THE BLOCK, AND THERE IS   
 LITTLE PROSPECT OF IT, IF A PROPOSAL  
 TO EXTEND THE BOUNDARY OF THE         
{COTSWALDS AREA OF OUTSTANDING NATURAL 
{BEAUTY}TO INCLUDE MUCH OF THE LAND    
 COVERED IN THIS SURVEY IS SUCCESSFUL.
