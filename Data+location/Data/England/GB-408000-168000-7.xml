  On 4th May 1985 the Church of St     
 James Avebury celebrated the 900th    
 anniversary of the first incumbent.   
 The Church itself dates back to Saxon 
 times and the local primary school    
 organised a Saxon day to commemorate  
 the occasion. The children made a     
 banner to hang in the Church and,     
 dressed in costumes down through the  
 ages celebrated with a procession a   
 playlet and a Saxon fair. This event  
 went went down well within the village
 and also among the tourist visitors on
 the day.                              </content>
