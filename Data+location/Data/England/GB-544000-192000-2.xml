		<title>02THE POLICE STATION</title>
		<content>   P.C. Ryan, has been at the police   
 station for 29 years, and he said that
 everything is changing. The summer    
 figures are higher than the winter    
 ones for arrests, because in the      
 summer, more tourists come. They have 
 2 cells, made of hard wood. Eight     
 policemen work at the station. At the 
 moment they have no prisoners. The    
 police keep track of everything going 
 on in the district, with computers.   
   There are training courses for two  
 years to see who will get into the    
 force. Sometimes on a call for help,  
 they have to travel as far as Ilford. 
 The Chief Inspecter of the whole force
 is Sir Kenneth Newman.The wages vary. 
   P.C. Ryan thinks that the area is   
 good for work because it has a good   
 variety.He is a gardener and a horse  
 rider in his spare time.The main      
 crime is theft and burglaries.        </content>
