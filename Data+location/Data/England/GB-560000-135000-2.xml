		<title>02Bells Yew Green Chapel</title>
		<content> There is an old chapel in Bells Yew   
 Green.  The chapel is sometimes used  
 for whist-drives, coffee mornings,etc.
 A house next to the chapel was built  
 on, but it has not always been like   
 this.  The{number of people attending 
 the chapel over the years has fallen. 
 There used to be about 3 services per 
 week in the chapel.  The people call  
 themselves{Congregationalists.} The   
{Countess of Huntingdon}sold all her   
 jewellery to enable small chapels like
 the one in Bells Yew Green to form.   
 The woman who lives in the house      
 joined to the chapel met her husband  
 there, and they married there.  In    
 1985 they were 89 and 92 years old.   
 They are not official caretakers of   
 the chapel, but they have the keys and
 take good care of it.  It holds about 
 20 people. It is carpeted and cosy.
