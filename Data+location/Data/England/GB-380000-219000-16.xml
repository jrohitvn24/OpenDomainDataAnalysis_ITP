		<content>   {Denmark High School}is an all girl 
 school.It was built about 100 years   
 ago.It is a very big building and has 
 many rooms.It is for 11-18 year old   
 girls.Number on roll September        
 1984-545.Number to be admitted in     
 September 1985 -60.Their playing      
 field is not part of the building     
 because when it was built there wasn't
 any grass and the nearest stretch of  
 grass is down Landsdown Road.That     
 means that they have to walk a long   
 way for their games.                  
   {Oxstalls}is an all boys school but 
 it is not a bit like Denmark, because 
 Oxstalls is a modern school.Due to    
 falling rolls it will only have 38    
 admitted in September.They have a 400 
 m running track.They have many clubs  
 like a break dancing,chess,computer   
 a few more.There are plans to merge   
 Denmark and Oxstalls Schools.         </content>
