		<title>02FARMING IN BISHOP MIDDLEHAM</title>
		<content> Most of the surrounding area is       
 farmland and used for the growing of  
 crops. Barley, corn and rape are the  
 most common crops grown.              
                                       
 Many of the farms have animals and    
 these are usually sheep and cattle.   
 The sheep are reared for their wool,  
 being sheared twice a year. Farmers   
 can expect to shear fleeces of around 
 3 kilos in weight. A good price for   
 this would be Â£1.20 a kilo.           
 The sheep in this area are marked with
 blue or red dye for identification.   
                                       
 Most of the farmers sell potatoes and 
 some sell eggs.
