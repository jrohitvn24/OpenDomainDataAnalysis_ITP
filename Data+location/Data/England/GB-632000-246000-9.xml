		<content> Thw majority of people here are       
 Americans living at RAF Woodbridge.   
 Despite cultural differences, their   
 family life is very similar to the    
 local population. Most families eat   
 breakfast "on the run" in that members
 of the family go to work &amp; school at  
 different times.It is usually a tradi-
 tional meal of cereal, toast, tea or  
 coffee.An important time for most fam-
 ilies is evening when a meal is taken 
 together and the day's activities dis-
 cussed. Even though American eating   
 habits in the USA differ from ours,   
 here they seem to adopt the British   
 tradition of meat or fish taken with  
 vegetables. There are various ethnic  
 groups within the community &amp; this is 
 reflected in the food available at the
 commissary, i.e. Italian, Mexican and 
 Jewish products.Barbecues are popular 
 in the summer, weather permitting!    </content>
