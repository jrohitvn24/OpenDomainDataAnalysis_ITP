		<title>02A FARM SURVEY NEAR ST.IVES</title>
		<content>    We surveyed the seven family farms 
 to the west of St Ives on the flat    
 coastal strip between the moorland and
 the cliffs.                           
    The 4{dairy}and 3{beef}farms have  
 an average size of 126 acres,with 122 
 cattle.                               
   The 4 milking herds (Guernsey,      
 Fresian and Ayrshires) are between    
 60-70 head. Milk is sent to the       
 Unigate dairy at St Erth.             
   The main crops are grass and fodder.
 Silage is made for winter feed.On     
 dairy farms the cattle are kept in at 
 this time. No farm has more than 2    
 full_time workers (apart from         
 family).Each has at least 3 tractors. 
   Three farms grow broccoli and       
 potatoes and sell them locally.Four   
 farms have camping or flats for       
 tourists.Two others do contracting    
 for other farms.                      </content>
