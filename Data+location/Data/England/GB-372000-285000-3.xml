		<content> The school was built in 1850 and is a 
 solid building made of sandstone.There
 is a school house attached to the     
 school which was renovated in 1983 by 
 the Parent Teacher Association to     
 provide extra teaching space.There are
 separate areas for computer           
 studies,art                           
 and craft,photographic developing and 
 printing and cookery.                 
   The children begin school in the    
 Infant class  for afternoons only when
 they are 4years 4months.At 4years     
 8months they come full time.When they 
 are aged 7 they move into the Junior  
 class which is taught by the          
 Headmaster.                           
   The parents raise a lot of money    
 to buy equipment for the              
 school.Recently we have been given a  
 camera,radio/cassette player          
 and computer printer.                 </content>
