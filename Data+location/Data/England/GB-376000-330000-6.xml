The land in this area is undulating,   
with wooded valleys, some with streams 
and some with quite steep hills. Rock  
out-crops are of soft sandstone and    
there are several caves, one of which  
was used for many years by on old      
hermit, who relied opon public         
generosity for his sustenance.         
The fields all have mixed hedges, which
contain a wide variety of deciduous    
trees.  There is a part of Bishops Wood
in this area, which is a conifer       
plantation, owned by the Forestry Commi
sion.  It is open to the public for    
walking and horse riding.              
The whole area is pleasing to the eye  
and is a pleasant example of the Heart 
of England.
