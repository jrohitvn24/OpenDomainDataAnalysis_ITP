 games which children play today. The  
 most popular are chasing games like   
 Chain Tig, Links and Grids. Any number
 of children can play the game called  
 Grids. One child is chosen to chase   
 after and try to catch all the other  
 children. The other children run all  
 around the playground and try to avoid
 being caught. If they stand on a      
 specially marked grid in the          
 playground, then they are safe and    
 cannot be caught.
