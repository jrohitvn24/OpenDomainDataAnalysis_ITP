		<content>   It is very difficult to predict the 
 effect which the expected expansion of
 Stansted Airport will have on this    
 area of quiet countryside. The farmer 
 whom we interviewed foresaw possible  
 problems caused by the much increased 
 number of people who would be working 
 and living in the area immediately    
 surrounding the airport. Proximity to 
 towns unfortunately seems to mean an  
 increased incidence of minor acts of  
 vandalism, and farming routine has to 
 be adapted to guard against this.     
   Again, although the area has been   
 designated as part of London's 'green 
 belt' there will inevitably be more   
 building, even if this is restricted  
 as at present to 'filling in'. It is  
 our fervent hope that the development 
 which takes place will enhance and    
 preserve rather than destroy the peace
 and beauty of this ancient village.   </content>
