		<title>15HOOK NORTON -ECOLOGY</title>
		<content>We went for a walk to the Nature       
Reserve. It used to be the old Hook    
Norton railway line. On the way we saw 
some "Jack in the hedge" and Dog roses.
"Jack goes to bed at noon" is a plant  
that goes to bed at noon. It is bigger 
than a dandelion clock  but looks like 
a dandelion clock. There was a very    
tall plant called Hog weed too. When   
we got there we went up some steps.    
When we got to the top we saw lots of  
plants and butterflies af all different
colours. We could hear the birds       
singing and whistling.We went up the   
left bank and the right side bank.     
There was a big tunnel but it was      
blocked up. We could hear water        
dripping in the tunnel. There was a    
wall there that was for holding the    
clay back from the railway lnes. We    
also found lots of slag. On the way    
back we saw a Sparrow Hawk.            </content>
