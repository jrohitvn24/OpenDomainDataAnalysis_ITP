		<title>11Rayleigh Mount</title>
		<content> We were concerned about the{pollution}
 in the moat. "Swein" built Rayleigh   
 Mount and he was mentioned in the     
 first Domesday Book.(*notes end of    
 line). We nearly caught a chill*Going 
 up the steep hill*On Rayleigh Mount*We
 had to count*All the petrol stations  
 and dentists along the way*Dirty old  
 mattress*And a broken brolly*Split    
{dustbin bags}*And a shopping          
 trolly*Rusty old springs*All covered  
 in slime*Shattered{old clock}that     
 can't tell the time*Stinky and        
 boggy*And squelshy like fudge*Ten     
 million insects*At home in the        
 sludge*.END In the moat there was a   
 crate*Complete with a broken plate*   
 When my Lord Swein was there it was   
 clean*Like a sunbeam*There was a      
 trolley*A balloon and a broken dolly* 
 Something else as well*And now{the}   
{moat doth smell* } END.               </content>
