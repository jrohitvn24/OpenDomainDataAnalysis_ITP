		<content> After leaving school approximately one
 third go on to Totton College another 
 third go on to Tech. College, the     
 remaining third go on either to Y.T.S.
 courses or a job.                     
 The Headmaster explained that the     
 present teachers action had not       
 affected the school too much. The     
 pupils had only been home for two and 
 a half days but with work. The lunch  
 time clubs and sporting activities    
 have been affected as has the school  
 orchestra and choir. The pupils have  
 taken their reports home uncompleted  
 because teachers had insufficient time
 during the school day to complete them
 and because they are working to rule  
 they would not complete them at home  
 in their own time
