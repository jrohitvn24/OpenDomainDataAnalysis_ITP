		<content> Kilmersdon has one traditional story. 
 The steep lane leading up from the    
 village to the school is known as Jack
 and Jill hill, and there at the top is
 a well. No claim of any other site    
 will be accepted by the true          
 Kilmersdonian. To prove it they quote 
 the large number of families with the 
 surname "Gilson" in the area. Jack and
 Jill were not children but man and    
 wife. "Jill's son" founded the family 
 of Gilson which has flourished ever   
 since.                                
 If further proof were needed, there in
 the valley is a cottage known as      
 Tumbler's Bottom where poor Jack      
 finally came to rest. On this theme an
 annual village day is planned. (Ref:  
 Howell - "Round here, in them days",  
 l980)
