 denomination founded in 1815 in North 
 Devon and North Cornwall. At first    
 Burrington members held meetings in   
 private houses, then in{1829}Hugh Ford
 bought two cottages for a Bible       
 Christian chapel. This is the present 
 building, though it has been altered  
 substantially since.In{1907}the Bible 
 Christians became part of the United  
 Methodist Church. There were then 100 
 members in Burrington.Many preachers  
 arrived on horseback and used to      
 stable their horses at "Homelands".The
 burial ground was dedicated in
