		<title>17Barnhill Quarry - disused.</title>
		<content> There is a scheme to fill in this     
 large industrial site with three      
 million tons of household refuse.The  
 Quarry owners have proposed that the  
 Quarry should be reclaimed over 20    
 years and that the land could then    
 become a park.The anti-tip Sodbury    
 Vale Action Group have objected to the
 scheme.They claimed that the tip would
 be too close to the dwellings and     
 shops of Chipping Sodbury,and that    
 there would be too many pests like    
 rats,flies,and seagulls.They were     
 worried in case the Quarry would      
 become a health hazard while the      
 rubbish is decomposing.Pollution would
 become a great problem and the amount 
 of traffic caused by the proposed     
 dumping would be at the rate of one   
 heavy lorry per minute through Chippng
 Sodbury High Street.The proposal has  
 been shelved for the moment.          </content>
