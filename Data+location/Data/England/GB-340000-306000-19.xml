		<title>19HALSTON COTTAGES PONTESBURY</title>
		<content> Halston Cottages is a small hamlet of 
 about a twenty houses.  Most of the   
 people have lived there as long as 10 
 to 25 years.  They moved there because
 it was closer to their work and they  
 travel over five miles to their work, 
 mostly by car.                        
 The library is about ten miles away,  
 but other amenities are within three  
 miles.  The people take part in       
 various activities, the most popular  
 being golf, walking, cycling,         
 gardening, knitting and reading.      
 Very few people go to church, and the 
 church is not active during the week. 
 The Junior school is less than three  
 miles away and children go there by   
 school bus or bicycle.                
 There is a local magazine for the     
 area.
