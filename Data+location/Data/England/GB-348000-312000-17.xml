		<title>17POLICING IN SHREWSBURY.</title>
		<content> Shrewsbury is policed by{"F" Division 
 of the{West Mercia Police Force.}It is
 made up of 234 officers of varying    
 rank. The police day is divided into  
 three eight hour shifts. The crime    
 detection figures for 1984 are rather 
 poor but it must be remembered that   
 many officers were out of the district
 on picket line duty. The crimes which 
 occur most frequently are burglary of 
 private dwellings and other buildings 
 and the theft of, and from motor cars.
 In both these categories the detection
 rate is well below{40%.}Crimes related
 to alcohol appear to be increasing,   
 with under age drinking and drunken   
 driving the major contributors.{Crime 
{prevention}plays a major role in      
 police work; property marking schemes 
 have been organised and the police are
 always willing to advise people on how
 best to secure their property.        </content>
