		<content> HISTORIC HOUSES                       
 Of the many interesting old houses in 
 this area only Great Chalfield is open
 to the public. Domesday records that  
 in Edward the Confessors time         
 Caldefelle was held by Wallef. Later  
 the manor came to William de Perci    
 whose heirs held it for 6 generations,
 the last being Harry Percy who died on
 pilgrimage at Cologne in 1356.        
 Chalfield was rebuilt and extended    
 by Thomas Tropnell in the late 15th.c.
 The centre of the house is the great  
 hall which has an oak screen with a   
 gallery,two oriels at the east end, it
 is believed that the hall is the only 
 one in England that has three stone   
 looking masks from which a good view  
 is obtained of activities below. There
 are many other features to the house  
 including a solar, a groined room, a  
 half timbered wing and a 90ft leat.   </content>
