		<title>19Ordnance Factory_Newtown</title>
		<content> The Ordnance Factory began to run down
 in 1943_44 and at the end of the war  
 it was moved to a more convenient     
 site.This left an area of unsightly   
 factory buildings and derelict land.  
 In the 1970s planners began to clear  
 the site.Only four of the twenty      
 bunkers were retained,the rest were   
 demolished.Houses,shops,factories,road
 s,schools were built.A nature reserve 
 was created,parks were laid out around
 and among the houses,hundreds of trees
 were planted along the roads.Now it is
 impossible to visualise the former    
 dereliction and the ordnance factory  
 of the 1940s is only recalled in some 
 of the street names:Ordnance Avenue,  
 Admirals Road.One of the bunkers is   
 scheduled to become a World War 2     
 Museum.The bunkers prove a tourist    
 attraction to visitors wishing to take
 a trip into the past.                 </content>
