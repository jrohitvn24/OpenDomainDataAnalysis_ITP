		<title>06FISHING IN WATERGATE BAY</title>
		<content> On 3:7:85 we went deep sea fishing in 
 Watergate Bay.At Newquay harbour we   
 got on the boats,The Sunrise owned    
 by John Lowe,which was 20ft long and  
 took 9 passangers and "Sea Horse"owned
 by Brian Morris,which was 32ft long   
 and took 12 passengers both boats were
 full.The tourists pay Â£4.50 to fish   
 for three hours. In the winter the    
 boats trawl for fish such as Bass,    
 Plaice and Skate and catch Mackerel,  
 Bass and Whiting near the surface with
 nets.Watergate Bay is an exellent area
 for catching crabs as there are lots  
 of rocks near the surface. In the     
 Summer the boats are popular with     
 tourists although they are still used 
 for catching crabs.                   
 On the way out the sea was calm and we
 put out weighted lines with spinners  
 on the end to catch Mackerel to use   
 for bait.                             </content>
