		<title>02CONSERVATION IN THE AREA</title>
		<content> The over-riding primary planning      
 policy in the area is one of conserv- 
 ation and enhancement of its special  
 character, i.e. landscape, village,   
 vegetation cover, wildlife. The area, 
 which is rich in flora and fauna, is  
 well covered by trees and in parts is 
 thickly wooded, whilst the remaining  
 open countryside is given over to     
 farming. To live in a rural area, such
 as this, needs a special affection for
 the countryside as it is not always   
 convenient, but those who do, would   
 not exchange it for an urban exist-   
 ence. The inhabitants are keen watch- 
 dogs, always mindful of changes, and  
 anxious to conserve their environment.
 The proposed development of a Pop     
 Festival site in 1972 prompted the    
 formation of the Nailbourne Protection
 Society which has defeated plans for a
 waste tip and the removal of woodland.</content>
