		<content>    As this is a farming area,most of  
 the work is connected with            
 agriculture.                          
    In the village of Walton on Trent, 
 about 24% of the people are employed  
 by the Electricity Board at Drakelow  
 Power Station.                        
    About another 80% travel out of the
 area to work in the near-by towns and 
 cities.The breweries,rubber factories 
 and engineering works of Burton on    
 Trent and Derby employ a lot of people
 from the surrounding areas.           
    A small number are employed in the 
 coal mines near Swadlincote and in    
 the service industries.               
    A rural area like this is also     
 popular with people who work in       
 education,the medical and other       
 professions,so the village is a       
 dormitory for people who work         
 elsewhere.                            </content>
