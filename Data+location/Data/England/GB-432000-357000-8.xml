		<title>08Lea School 1862-1873</title>
		<content>   Lea school was built in 1808 by     
{Florence Nightingale's}parents. We    
 have taken these records from our     
 school logs 1862-1889.                
    In 1862, Lea school was hit by     
 severe colds causing poor attendance, 
 also,{Scarlet Fever}struck the school;
 this also occured eleven years later  
 with{two deaths.   }                  
    On Tuesday March 5th 1867 the      
 children arrived early and locked the 
 teachers out saying that it would last
 until half term. The average          
 attendance in 1867 was about 120-130  
 while today in 1985 it is 85-95.      
   {Smallpox}broke out in March 1865   
 resulting in the{death}of Edward      
 Bunting. On Friday 24th March 1865    
{Scarlett Fever}was discovered and     
 again on 28th February 1873 with{two  
{deaths}on the same day. Also, two     
 teachers had the fever.               </content>
