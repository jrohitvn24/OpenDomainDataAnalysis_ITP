		<title>11OUR SCHOOL POND,FENSTANTON</title>
		<content>   {  Two years ago in 1983 we decided 
{to dig a pond at school.              
{    }We made the pond and let the     
 grass and trees grow around it so it  
 looked a bit wild.                    
     {In the pond}there are{newts,water
{snails,water boat men,water beetles,  
{and skaters.}                         
      I saw{a toad}and it went plop.   
 It scared me.We picked some{snails}and
 had a close look.You must put them    
 back carefully because they are really
 fragile.                              
      Also we looked at animals{living 
{around the pond.                      
      I saw{butterflys,dragon flies,   
{damsel flies,}and lots more.          
      Behind the tree stumps there was 
 some{barley.}I picked  it up and it   
 seemed to stick to you.               
      We have had a{grass snake}in the 
 pond,swimming.                        </content>
