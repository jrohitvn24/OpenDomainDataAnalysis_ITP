		<title>03WITHYCOMBE FARM,WIVELISCOMBE</title>
		<content> We asked a local farmer's wife about  
 Withycombe Farm, 1km west of          
 Wiveliscombe. On Mrs. Hayes' farm     
 there are 70 cows, 350 ewes, 50 beef  
 cows and 570 lambs.                   
 She told us that she doesn't have to  
 do much on the farm, but she does help
 with calving and lambing.  She also   
 told us that it wasn't difficult being
 a farmer's wife, but she has to be    
 around alot in case there are any     
 accidents or to help in any other     
 way.                                  
 They have 320 acres, and 50 acres are 
 usually used for corn.  There is one  
 field that is very steep and they     
 don't use it that often. They do have 
 farm problems like unsuitable weather,
 or lambing and calving difficulties.  
 They  have two dogs, Jenny and Ted,   
 which are used for herding the        
 stock.                                </content>
