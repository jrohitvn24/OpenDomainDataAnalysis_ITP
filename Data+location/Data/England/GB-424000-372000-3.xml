		<title>03A FARMER'S DAY</title>
		<content>     I get up at 6.30. After milking,  
 which takes about 2 hours, I take the 
 cows out into the fields and then go  
 in for breakfast.                     
                                       
     I wash all the milking parlour    
 equipment and circulate all the       
 milking line with boiling water and   
 detergent, then clean out the         
 cowsheds. For the rest of the day I   
 work in the fields and repair         
 machinery until milking time          
 again in the evening.                 
                                       
     When the young stock and sheep and
 lambs are out in the fields, I have to
 check them every day to make sure they
 are all well. In winter, we keep the  
 sheep and the stock inside. Nearly all
 the time is taken up feeding and      
 looking after them.
