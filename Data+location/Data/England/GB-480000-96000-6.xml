		<title>06EAST WITTERING C.P.SCHOOL</title>
		<content> East Wittering Primary School was     
 originally housed in the Parish Hall  
 which was old and always seemed dusty.
 There were then three classes which   
 were all held in the main hall.Each   
 teacher had a blackboard and easel and
 the pupils had slates and chalks for  
 some lessons and books for others.    
   The"new"school was built in 1949 and
 today consists of four classrooms in  
 the mainbuilding,a classroom used as a
 library,a dining area,two hutted class
 rooms and a purpose built Nursery Unit
 which is used as an additional infant 
 classroom.In Sept.'85 there will be 3 
 Infant classes and 4 Junior classes.We
 use the Youth Centre nearby two after_
 noons per week for P.E.,Country       
 Dancing and Movement,and the          
 playground and school field for Games 
 when the weather is fine.
