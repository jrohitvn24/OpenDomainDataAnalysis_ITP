		<title>02LIFE IN A VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Living in a village can be difficult  
 for transport, as often the buses do  
 not travel there. Also there are not  
 many large department stores, so you  
 have to do your weekly shopping in    
 town. Living in a village is much more
 peaceful than living in a town. Also  
 there is much more wildlife. Living in
 a town is much more convenient for    
 gas, petrol, etc.Also it may be hard  
 to find transport in a village to your
 work unless you have a car, because   
 often there aren't many jobs apart    
 from farming, and if your ambition is 
 not to be a farmer but to be a        
 business person, youv'e got a problem.
