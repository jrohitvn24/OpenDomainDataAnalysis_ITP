 The villages in the block were        
 mentioned in the first Domesday book. 
 Marsh Gibbon was said to be held by   
 Alric,harshly and wretchedly.         
  It is now a pleasant rural community 
 with many old buildings and views that
 have been made into a conservation    
 area.                                 
                                       
  THE INFORMATION ON THE BLOCK WAS     
 COLLECTED AND RESEARCHED BY A GROUP OF
 CHILDREN AGED 7 - 9 FROM MARSH GIBBON 
 FIRST SCHOOL,ASSISTED BY PARENTS AND  
 THE HEADTEACHER,MRS.B.T.DICKINSON,AND 
 HER HUSBAND.
