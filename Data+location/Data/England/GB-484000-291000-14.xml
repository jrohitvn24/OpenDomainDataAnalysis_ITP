 This area is noted for its abundance  
of churches. Every village has its own 
old stone church. They are generally   
very large, the exception being the    
church in Rockingham.This was          
origionally the church for the owner of
the castle and even today the owner has
the right to grant the Living of the   
church. The churches all have very     
interesting graveyards with gravestones
going back up to 200 years.            
  We felt that many of the churches had
 an empty feel as if they had been     
empty for a long time
