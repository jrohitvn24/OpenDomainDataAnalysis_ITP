		<title>10Old and New Houses</title>
		<content> In our survey district the houses are 
 a mixture of old and new. The older   
 houses in the area are mainly built in
 the Cotswalds style. The village of   
 Colerne has doubled in size over the  
 last forty years.                     
                                       
 We have looked at the oldest and the  
 newest houses in the village.The      
 oldest house is called Daubeneys it   
 was built around 1260 and New College 
 Oxford may have restored it in the    
 1600's . It was originally a          
 longhouse, the family lived at one end
 and the animals lived at the other    
 this way of  living had a purpose the 
 animals body_heat would rise and act  
 as central heating. The main framework
 of the house was built with large oak 
 crooks. Outside  the house is built of
 stone and the roof is covered in stone
 tiles.                                </content>
