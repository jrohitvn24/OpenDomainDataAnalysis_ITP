		<content>    In the centre of our area is the   
 site of the once important Roman town 
 of Ariconium.                         
    Ariconium used to be quite large   
 but now not a stone can be found      
 beneath Herefordshire soil.Historians 
 for centuries have debated its exact  
 location but in the 18th century a    
 writer Horsley said it lies near Ross.
 Existing ruins were found between the 
 villages of Weston-under-Penyard and  
 Aston Crews,the ruins of Ariconium.   
   Now the ruins are gone and where the
 town stood is a great emptiness and   
 only broken pieces of pottery and     
 stones can be found.                  
   Although Ariconium remains as a     
 ghost it still gives its name to      
 roads.It lay on the main route from   
 Gloucester to the west.The A40 today  
 runs close to where the site is.
