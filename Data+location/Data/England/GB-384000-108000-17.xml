		<title>17Dorset Farms 1</title>
		<content>  Our area is mostly grassland and     
 woodland, with some crops. Farmers    
 store grass for the winter as silage, 
 or the cows eat it in the fields.     
                                       
  We have been to 5 farms.             
 Three of these are dairy farms.       
 The first one had 145 cows. The       
 second had 53, and the last one had 2.
 At Lazerton Farm where there are only 
 two cows, they are milked by hand.    
                                       
  It was interesting that one farm was 
 formerly 500 acres, now it is only 94 
 acres. Another farm has 380 acres.    
                                       
  Ash Farm can't have any farm animals 
 because it has got something wrong    
 with the ground. They do have some    
 deer which were just out in the open. 
 So Ash Farm grows wheat,rape,grass    
 seed and peas.                        </content>
