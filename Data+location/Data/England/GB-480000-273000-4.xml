		<title>04NEW HOUSES IN BROUGHTON</title>
		<content>WE DID AN INTERVIEW WITH ONE OF THE    
LADIES WHO WORKS FOR THE ESTATE AGENTS,
TILLEY AND MORGAN. THEY ARE SELLING    
THE BRAND NEW HOUSES BUILT BY CHARTER  
HOMES. THERE ARE SEMI-DETACHED HOUSES, 
DETACHED HOUSES AND BUNGALOWS FOR SALE.
THEY ARE IN A MOCK TUDOR STYLE WITH    
WOODEN BEAMS.IT TAKES SIX MONTHS TO    
BUILD EACH HOUSE.THE PRICES START FROM 
19,750 POUNDS FOR THE TWO-BEDROOMED,   
SEMI-DETACHED FALSTAFF HOUSE TO 43,750 
POUNDS FOR THE FOUR-BEDROOMED,         
DETACHED MARLBOROUGH HOUSE.ALL THE     
ROADS ARE NAMED AFTER PEOPLE WHO LIVED 
IN BROUGHTON.THESE HOUSES HAVE BEEN    
EASY TO SELL BECAUSE THEY ARE A VERY   
REASONABLE PRICE.SIMILAR HOUSES IN     
NORTHAMPTON OR KETTERING ARE DEARER.   
ALSO, PEOPLE LIKE TO LIVE IN A VILLAGE 
ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE BYPASS IS      
BUILT.MOST OF THE NEW PEOPLE HAVE COME 
FROM KETTERING AND NORTHAMPTON.        </content>
