		<title>11A pupil describes Babbacombe</title>
		<content>    I live in Babbacombe in a modern   
 semi-detached house.Although there is 
 a large range of local shops most     
 people tend to travel to              
 St.Marychurch,a short walk away,or    
 Torquay town centre,a short bus ride  
 away,for weekly shopping because of   
 the high prices locally.There are also
 several public houses and a theatre   
 near the shopping area.               
    I go to the theatre about four     
 times a year.It is run by the{TOADS   
{(Torbay Operatic and Dramatic Society)
    There are many pleasant open grassy
 areas by the coast with wonderful     
 views over the bay.There is a{cliff   
{railway}to take visitors down to the  
 beach.Most of the houses are Victorian
 and many of the lerge houses have been
 converted to holiday flats,guest      
 houses or hotels.
