		<title>08LIFE IN SKREENS PARK,ROXWELL</title>
		<content>       In Skreens Park Wood live an    
 elderly couple. They don't live in a  
 proper house they live in a stable    
 from Skreens Mansion. They have no    
 electricity.They have lots of animals 
 donkeys, chickens, cockerel, wild     
 cats and a dog. They own 7-8 acres of 
 land and in that land they have a red 
 brick wall which is worth Â£1500. 10   
 houses could be built out of the wall.
 They have had lots of builders ask if 
 they would sell the wall but they said
 no.                                   
       They also have on their land    
 collectors items of tractors and cars.
                                       
       Neither of them work as they're 
 both retired. The man said the wall   
 was built 200 years ago and will be   
 there for another 200 years ,         
 hopefully.                            
                                       </content>
