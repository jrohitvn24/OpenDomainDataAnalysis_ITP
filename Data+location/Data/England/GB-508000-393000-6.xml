		<title>06PARISH COUNCIL CLAXBY</title>
		<content> Five councillors, one Clerk/Treasurer 
 and a West Lindsey District councillor
 attend meetings approximately seven   
 times a year when all matters relating
 to the parish and community are       
 discussed. The press and public may   
 attend these meetings and occasionally
 public meetings are called. Subjects  
 discussed include obstructions to     
 footpaths, the playing field, street  
 lighting, sewage problems and road    
 safety. Copies of planning            
 applications for the village are      
 observed, discussed and returned to   
 the Planning Officer at West Lindsey  
 District Council together with        
 objections for consideration.         
 A sum of money is allocated annually  
 to be used for stationary, postage,   
 telephone calls, insurance and upkeep 
 of the churchyard, also for the good  
 of the community.                     </content>
