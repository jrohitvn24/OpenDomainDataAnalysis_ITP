		<content> Chester-le-Street's soccer team has   
 its home ground at Chester Moor on the
 southern outskirts.Improvements to the
 ground since 1975 include a 200       
 seater Grandstand accomodating most of
 the average crowd of 220,some covered 
 terracing and new floodlights for 1985
 -86.Also,23 Junior School teams       
 compete for the league and cup,the    
 C.B. Watson and the R.O.Willis        
 trophies.                             
 Football is still popular,although the
 customary Shrove Tuesday match        
 involving hundreds of people ended in 
 1932 following claims of damage to    
 property and lost business by traders.
 The game started outside the Lambton  
 Arms hotel and lasted over 4 hours.The
 aim was to reach one end of the of the
 street but,since it slopes down to Con
 Burn,the ball usually ended up there.
