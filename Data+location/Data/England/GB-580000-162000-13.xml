{MARBLES}:They are very popular at     
 Hartlip school,but we do not play it  
 in the usual way.We have 2 drain lids 
 to play on.The aim of the game is to  
 get a marble into the dip in the      
 middle of the drain.If it goes off the
 lid both players have to begin        
 again.We have 2 drain lids,one with 2 
 dips so 3 games can be played at      
 once.We do play free ground too.There 
 are many tactics,flicks,bombs,stops   
 and rebounds.Marbles is a very serious
 game!
