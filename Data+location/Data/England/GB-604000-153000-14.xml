		<title>14THE RAPTOR CENTRE</title>
		<content> The Raptor Centre is found in the     
 castle estate but it is run and       
 organised separately. The word Raptor 
 means bird of prey.People bring       
 injured birds of prey into the centre 
 and they are cared for and then       
 released back into the wild. The      
 centre cares for about 50 to 60       
 injured birds each year.Species of    
 bird include owls, kestrels, buzzards 
 and eagles.Some of these birds are    
 taught to fly in a demonstration for  
 tourists. They fly free without a     
 lead and come back on their own. Only 
 one bird is displayed at one time.The 
 birds are attracted by pieces of meat 
 that are swung on leads or held on the
 hand. A special thick glove has to be 
 put on the hand.
