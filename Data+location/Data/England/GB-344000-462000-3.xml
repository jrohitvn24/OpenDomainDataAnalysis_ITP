		<content> In our area a new Asda hypermarket has
 opened. It is very popular because it 
 offers free parking and a large       
 variety of goods at low prices.       
 Previously most people shopped at the 
 Arndale Shopping Centre and although  
 it is still popular it is not as busy 
 as Asda. Over the last twenty years a 
 lot of small shops have suffered loss 
 of trade because they cannot compete  
  Asda has late shopping evenings, a   
 play area and its own petrol station. 
 However, many have survived because   
 they offer personal service. Bare     
 still has a busy main street with a   
 variety of shops which are popular    
 with residents and visitors. Although 
 they have had to change they are still
 an important part of the community.   
 Shopping habits have changed over the 
 years. Shopping is often a weekly     
 outing for the whole family.          </content>
