		<title>09Helen's Wednesday In School</title>
		<content>      On Wednesday we have a whole     
 school assembly which is where all    
 the school gets together in the main  
 hall at 10.20 and it finishes at about
 11.00. In an assembly we sing two     
 hymns and Mr. Hilliard, our current   
 Headmaster, reads us a story.         
      The first lesson in the afternoon
 is music with Mr.Want and Mrs.Albert. 
 We use a tape called "Silver Burdett  
 Music Scheme". We have books to go    
 with the tape. Usually we sing along  
 with the tape,doing things such as    
 rounds.                               
      After music we have topic with   
 Mr.Want. I think the topic is quite   
 interesting. We tend to do different  
 aspects of maths. This lesson ends at 
 3.20, that's when the bell goes to go 
 home. In the evening I go to Aikido it
 is a good form of self defence. We    
 need special costume for this.        </content>
