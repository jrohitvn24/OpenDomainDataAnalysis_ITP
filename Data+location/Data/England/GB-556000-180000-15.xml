		<content> At weekends I normally wake up when I 
 feel like it.On Saturdays I get up    
 very early because I normally go out  
 shopping with my mate.                
      We go shopping because we like   
 going in shops and looking at         
 different clothes and trying them on,I
 also like spending my money.          
      After that we normally go into   
 Olivers for a bite to eat.            
      It's very posh in there ,their   
 food is quite healthy because of their
 salad and stuff.                      
      After all that we carry on       
 looking around and around.Sometimes I 
 think there should be more things to  
 do.                                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
