       There are lots of buildings in  
 Rookhope. Most of them are very old   
 houses, apart from the Crescent. There
 are six new houses in the Crescent.   
 They are about ten years old.         
       Barrington Cottage used to be   
 the school. Now, it has four bedrooms.
 The house on the corner opposite the  
 Post Office was the school too at one 
 time.                                 
       Most people have semi-detached  
 houses. In Rookhope nearly everyone   
 has a telephone.                      
       Some houses are holiday         
 cottages.                             
       There is a church, chapel,      
 working men's club, post office, co-op
 and a village hall.
