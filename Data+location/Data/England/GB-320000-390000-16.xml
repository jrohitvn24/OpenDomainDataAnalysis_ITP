		<title>16GREAT MEOLS "SUNKEN FOREST"</title>
		<content> On the coast of Meols is a{submerged  
{forest}which has been seen at times.  
 During the latter half of the         
 Nineteenth Century and the early part 
 of the Twentieth,between the tides the
 forest beds were a well known feature 
 on the N.Coast of the peninsula.It has
 attracted scientists and naturalists. 
 The forest beds are the sad remains of
 land drowned by a rise in sea-level   
 after the {Ice Age.                   
 5000 years ago,in contrast to the man-
 made landscape of pasture,crops and   
 habitations,this part of{Wirral}was a 
 dense forest. Pollen of Elm and Alder 
 are found in large numbers in the{Dove
{Point}peat;Hazel and Buckthorn also   
 being common.                         
 The ancient woods remained until early
 farming communities began clearing the
 land for crops and animals about 5000 
 years ago.                            </content>
