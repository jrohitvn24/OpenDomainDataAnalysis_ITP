		<title>10Rural Industry-Growing Turf.</title>
		<content> Ro-lawn is an example of industry in  
 this area.  It is a very successful   
 company which sells different kinds of
 turf such as football turf, hockey    
 turf,golfing turf and so on. They also
 sell grass seed but very little its   
 mainly turf. Ro_lawn have their Head  
 office in Elvington but there are     
 other offices in other places.        
    When they find a flat field with   
 hardly any stones in, and is very     
 flat they put the seed on and roll    
 it.When the seed has  sprouted they   
 cut it frequently to encourage root   
 growth.The cut grass is left on the   
 ground to wither and provide nutrients
    When the turf is ready they cut it 
 off with big machines into thin       
 layers.They put these layers of turf  
 onto palettes and load the palettes   
 onto a lorry.Then lorries deliver the 
 turf to customers.                    </content>
