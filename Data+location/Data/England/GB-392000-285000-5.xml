		<content> There are an abundance of industries  
 in this block but the most important  
 is the metal manufacturing industry.  
 Many types of products are made from  
 nuts and bolts to steel pipes and from
 garden swings to abbatoir fittings.   
 The Cradley Heath area is particularly
 famous for chainmaking, dating back   
 many years.  The anchor chain for the 
 "Titanic" was made with each link     
 weighing about five hundredweight.    
 Most of these factories obtain their  
 raw materials from within The Black   
 Country for speed and economic        
 reasons.  The finished products are   
 distributed throughout the UK as well 
 as all over the world.  The area has  
 been severely hit by the closure of   
 firms and consequent unemployment     
 including Round Oak Steel Works which 
 employed over two thousand workers.
