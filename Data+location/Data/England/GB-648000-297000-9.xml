    1km or less                0       
    1km to 2km                 5       
    2km to 3km                 1

The distances are from school in a     
straight line.Most people came from    
three to four kilometres away, and     
nobody came from less than one         
kilometre away. As most people live so 
far away from school they nearly all   
travel to school by bus. On page 10 we 
have included a transport to school    
survey.
