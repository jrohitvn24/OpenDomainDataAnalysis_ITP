The First Wetley Rocks Cub Scout Troop 
was formed in 1977 for boys who are 8  
to 10 years old. At the present time   
there are 25 members. Cubs learn basic 
camping skills at the meetings as well 
as working to gain badges in many      
different areas. The success of the    
Cub Scouts led to the formation of the 
Scout Troop in 1978 for boys between   
10 &amp; 15 yrs. Many varied activities    
are undertaken such as canoeing,       
mountain climbing and orienteering.    
The highlight of the Scout Year is the 
annual summer camp where the scouts    
camp away from home for a week, doing  
their own cooking and looking after    
themselves. After the age of 15 the    
boys may join the Venture unit which   
assists with the scout activities and  
organises adventurous activities for   
itself.                                </content>
