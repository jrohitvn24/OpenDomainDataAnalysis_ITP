		<title>02A Typical Day.</title>
		<content>{ Monday}is a typical day for me. I    
 feel terrible getting up on the first 
 day of the week.As soon as I'm ready, 
 I set off for school.                 
   When my teacher has taken the       
 register we line up and go to         
{assembly.}After assembly we have hymn 
{practice.}All the teachers leave      
 except for the music teacher and one  
 other teacher who walks around        
 listening to our beautiful singing.   
   When we return to our class we have 
{maths.}until first break. Break lasts 
 for 15 minutes and after the bell we  
 get changed for{P.E.}Dinner is at     
 12 o'clock and then we play until     
 1.15 p.m. Our last playtime is at     
 2.15 p.m. At the end of the day we    
 have{athletics}until 4.30p.m.         
  When I get home I have tea and get   
 changed. Then I go to{Allensmore Farm 
 for{table-tennis coaching.            </content>
