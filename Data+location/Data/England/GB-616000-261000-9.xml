		<title>09Housing in Debenham.</title>
		<content>Debenham has doubled in area since 1960
Considerable house-building took place 
in the early 1960s on several estates  
and some council houses were built,too.
The new houses are near to the village 
centre yet hidden by the historic      
facade of the older part of the village
  The most recent addition has been the
Barratts development,which is still    
under construction.On existing estates 
such as Gardeners Road,gaps have been  
filled and extensions built.           
  Both estate agents report that house 
prices within the village itself are   
higher than those in surrounding areas.
This is because this is a self-contain-
ed village with good communications    
with centres of employment such as     
Stowmarket and Ipswich.Demand is part- 
icularly high for period properties    
and houses in need of renovation.There 
is little private,rented accommodation.</content>
