		<title>18A DAY IN THE LIFE OF NICOLA</title>
		<content>   In the morning I wake up at about   
 6.45am.I read a book until 7.15am and 
 then I go to the front door and get   
 the newspaper.I read the paper to see 
 what is going on in the world around  
 me.I get out of bed at 7.45am and get 
 dressed.I then go and get my breakfast
 and afterwards I get washed,brush my  
 teeth and brush my hair.Then I get my 
 bag and put on my coat.We, my mum,and 
 sisters and I get in the car and go to
 school.A couple of minutes after we   
 arrive the whistle goes.We go in and  
 after Mrs.Pepper, our form teacher has
 called the registar, we do our Daily  
 Ten.Then we have assembly and do some 
 other work.We have break at 10.30am   
 and we play boarding schools.After    
 school I go horse riding for half an  
 hour. When I return home in the       
 evening I play with my sisters, have  
 my tea,watch TV and go to bed at 9.00.</content>
