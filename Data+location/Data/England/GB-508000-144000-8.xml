		<content>{Ascension Day.                        
 Every year on Ascension Day we go up  
 Pitch Hill.  Before we go up Pitch    
 Hill we have a picnic.  After lunch we
 walk up Pitch Hill.  When we are on   
 the top of the hill we have an        
 assembly.  We sing hymns and say a    
 prayer.  Then we play games.  After   
 that we go back down the hill.        
{Harvest.                              
 In Autumn our school has a Harvest    
 Festival.  We go to church and bring  
 some fruit and vegetables.            
 Sometimes we bring bread and corn.    
 In church we sing songs and hymns.    
 After we have thanked God for         
 Harvest we go back to school.  There  
 we sometimes have bread rolls and     
 grapes and blackberry jelly.  We have 
 a drink of milk or orange.  The mums  
 and dads have coffee.Then they go     
 home and we have lessons.             </content>
