		<content> The area is picturesque and sparsely  
 populated. It lies in the valley of   
 the River Stour between Ashford and   
 Canterbury. The North Downs, lined    
 with belts of trees, rise steeply on  
 either side. The scene is             
 agricultural, fields with arable      
 crops, fruit and livestock.           
 Attractive parkland surrounds         
 Olantigh,a particular feature being   
 the suspension bridge crossing the    
 river to the north of the house. There
 are many fine views across fields     
 towards the Downs. Crundale is        
 situated in a fold of the Downs and on
 a summer day when the roses are in    
 bloom seems to be a place apart. Many 
 of the winding lanes are sunken and   
 lined with hedgerows.
