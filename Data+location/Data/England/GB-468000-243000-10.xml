		<content>A huntsman wearing a red jacket and    
riding a horse is said to enter number 
12, High Street three or four times a  
year, passing through the dairy wall   
at the north end of the house.  He is  
believed to be a friendly spirit, but  
causes an inexplicable, cold sensation 
by his presence. He is dated after     
1890  because, prior to that, green    
was worn by the local Grafton Hunt,    
now at  Paulerspury.                   
Returning from work on a moped after   
passing a row of old cottages along    
Cow Pastures lane, a  local lady had a 
strange experience.  A dark shape      
crossed the road in front of her.      
Later at the Records Office it was     
revealed a Vicar had been murdered on  
that date at that very  place over     
100 years ago, on 30th November.
