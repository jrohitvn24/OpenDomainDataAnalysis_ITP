		<content>{PIANO FACTORY WOODCHESTER}.The Stroud 
 valleys are the site of some of the   
 oldest cloth mills in Britain.        
 At Woodchester,2 miles from Stroud, a 
 piano factory now occupies the site of
 one of these mills.George 2nd is said 
 to have visited the mill in the 18th  
 century.Today the factory is          
 responsible for producing 3,300 pianos
 annually. All the processes involved  
 in piano manufacture,from seasoning,  
 veneering and sanding the wood,       
 stringing keyboards on frame          
 casting,to the final fine-tuning,take 
 place under one roof.Piano manufacture
 started here in 1911 and the company  
 originally shared the building with an
 egg incubation works.There was an     
 initial prosperous period before the  
 factory suffered a fire in 1938.Now   
 recovered,exports make up over half   
 the production.                       </content>
