		<content>      The dominant land cover in all   
 twelve grid squares is intensively    
 managed grassland. In total it makes  
 up approximately 75% of the total area
 and is probably a response to the     
 relatively high rainfall experienced  
 by this area, about l,000 mm per year.
 This grassland occupies both the tops 
 of the small hills and the valley     
 sides but on the floors of the small  
 river valleys deciduous woodland is   
 very common. Arable crops occupy only 
 about 5% of the area and barely       
 appears to be the most common. On the 
 increase at the present time is land  
 devoted to transport as the new road  
 linking the proposed bridge over the  
 Torridge with North Cornwall, runs    
 across the northwest corner of this   
 area.
