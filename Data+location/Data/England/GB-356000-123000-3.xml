		<title>03HAMLET OF WALES-THE 2 WELLS</title>
		<content>    In the hamlet of Wales there are   
 two wells, both were believed to have 
 healing properties. People with eye   
 diseases travelled great distances to 
 visit Eyewell believing that the soft 
 water would cure their ailments. A    
 little lower and nearer to the River  
 Cam is Blackwell. This well contains  
 harder more sulpherus water which     
 appeared to cure diseases of the skin.
 The visitors which these wells brought
 to the village were welcomed by the   
 villagers eager for money.            
    If river water entered the wells   
 the villagers would bail it out,      
 fearing that their source of income   
 would suffer when the diluted water   
 failed to heal.                       
    Nowadays the sites of the wells are
 kept clear by the villagers so that   
 they can still be visited.
