		<title>07Old Town _ Struthers Farm</title>
		<content> A little higher up the hillside ,on   
 your left you will see roofs of       
 another farm,{Old Town,}which is      
 reputed to be built on the site of a  
 Roman fort,as mentioned in {Wallis    
{Northumberland,1786}but this has never
 been proved.Look for the stone stiles 
 over the walls en-route making for    
 this farm.Cross over stile near       
 buildings walk with wall on your right
 on high side of {Struthers Farm.}Just 
 beyond{Struthers,}pass through a      
 gate,cross over a rough track and     
 through a second gate;continue the    
 path due east across two              
 fields,bearing slightly to your right 
 in the second field,until you reach a 
 stone wall.There is a stone stile in  
 this wall which is not easy to        
 find;look for it a little south of a {
{pre-fabricated hut. }
