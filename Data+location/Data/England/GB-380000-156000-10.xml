		<title>10THE COMPUTER</title>
		<content> Our school has an {ACORN B}computer.  
 We have had it now for two years. We  
 have also got a {VALIANT}"Felicity"   
 turtle. You place it on the floor and 
 type in on the computer where you want
 her to go. If the printer is plugged  
 in too, whatever Felicity does comes  
 out onto the paper. She can turn ,    
 beep and park. We have lots of        
 computer adventures like "Spacex" and 
 "Grannies Garden" ; simulations like  
 "Teashop" and "Candyfloss" ; we write 
 with "Primary pen" and "Wordwise" and 
 draw with "Ollie Octopus". There are  
 also some arcade games but we don't   
 often use them - only after school    
 sometimes. I like computers . My      
 brother wants one for Christmas. I    
 enjoy using the computer because if   
 there is no one else to play with you 
 can still have a game and the computer
 doesn't alwaya win.                   </content>
