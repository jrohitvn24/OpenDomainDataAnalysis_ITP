		<title>18A Child's Life in Ponsanooth</title>
		<content> Although the school is outside the    
 area it is very important in the life 
 of the village as most of the events  
 are connected with it. There are 64   
 children in the school who go on to   
 Penryn Comprehensive school when they 
 leave at eleven. There are two        
 playgroups run by mothers which meet  
 at various places. The children have  
 to make their own amusements most of  
 the time although there are some after
 school activities such as sailing     
 club, guitar lessons and sports. This 
 year the school organized three trips 
 to do with a maritime project,        
 one group sailing on a schooner and   
 two youth hostelling for four days. We
 think that Ponsanooth will expand as  
 more firms move in and we have noticed
 the increase in noise, traffic and    
 people.                               
                                       </content>
