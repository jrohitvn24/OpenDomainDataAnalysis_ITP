 village.One is a post office come     
 general store.The other is a shop for 
 Fancy Dress Costume Hire.For approx Â£7
 a costume may be hired from a         
 collection of nearly 200.Christmas and
 New Years Eve are the busiest time for
 the shop and the "Andy Pandy" costume 
 is the most popular for ladies and the
 Cavalier for men.a mobile shop visits 
 the village regularly as does the     
 local library van.Daily papers are    
 only delivered to peoples homes on a  
 Sunday.There is one school in the     
 village taking children from ages     
 5_9.They have to travel to            
 Bletchley,Woburn Sands and Milton     
 Keynes area for further               
 education.There are no doctors  or    
 dentists in the village so the people 
 have to go into the near by towns and 
 their nearest hospital is at M.K.     </content>
