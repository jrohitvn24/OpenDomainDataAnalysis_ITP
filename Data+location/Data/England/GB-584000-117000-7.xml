		<title>07THE PARISH COUNCIL</title>
		<content> The Parish Council draws its money    
 from the Rates, via Rother R>D>C>  We 
 precept for about a 1p rate, which    
 yields about Â£320, and Rother provides
 about as much again for special       
 functions, giving us about Â£640 to    
 spend each year.  Apart from insur_   
 ances and a small grant to the clerk, 
 we help support the Church Hall and   
 pay Â£50 towards the wages of a        
 'Lollipop Lady' who sees our children 
 safely across the rtoad in the        
 afternoon.  East Sussex used to pay   
 her to work morning and afternoon, but
 their spending cuts forced us to      
 provide for her ourselves.  Brede     
 School P.T.A. and Brede Parish Council
 contribute the rest.  We also provide 
 and look after four bus shelters.     
 Then, if funds run to it we make a    
 small grant to each of the village    
 clubs.  We also help with Churchyard. </content>
