		<title>03Sindles Farm</title>
		<content> The owners name is Mr Veltom. The farm
 is a dairy but grows crops to feed the
 animals. The whole farm has 250 acres.
 The farm is roughly 200 years old and 
 it used to belong to the Earl of      
 Besborough in Stansted. Mr.Veltom     
 rented it from Stansted for 10 years  
 and then bought it and called it      
 Sindles farm. Four men work on the    
 farm for they have a lot of machines  
 and do not need as many workers. It   
 takes 1 minute to milk one cow by     
 machine and two hours to milk a herd. 
  By hand it takes 10 to 15 minutes    
 to milk one cow. They have a lot of   
 machines on the farm like the milking 
 machine, tractors, combine harvesters.
 The mower sprayer and digger all go on
 the back of the tractors.
