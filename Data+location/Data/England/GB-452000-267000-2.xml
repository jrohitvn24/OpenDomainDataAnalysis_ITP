		<title>02Barby - Local History</title>
		<content>Place Names - One theory is that Barby 
was a Saxon settlement and that the    
name Barby means "village on the hill".
Barby is mentioned in the Domesday Book
and was referred to as BERCHEBI, and   
was part of the Alwardsley or Fawsley  
Hundred.                               
Lost Mediaeval Villages - The sites    
remain of two lost villages.  Onley was
wiped out by the Â£Black Death". A      
largish mound exists which is said to  
be a mass grave.  Other bumps and dips 
show the existence of walls and        
pathways. The church bell is now       
installed at St. Mary's Church, Barby. 
Little is known about Sawcliff, it may 
have died out after the Enclosure Acts.
Cultivation Remains - Prior to the     
Enclosure Act of 1778 three large      
fields enclosed the village. Wood      
Field to the West, Brackleydale to the 
East and Nether Field to the North.    </content>
