        {IN LEIGH AND BRANSFORD        
      There are two{general stores     
 serving the area, one at the service  
 station at Bransford and the other at 
 the Post Office at Leigh.  However,   
 the scattered nature of the housing   
 and the fact that there are many old  
 people have resulted in a number of   
{mobile services. }There are weekly    
 rounds by a general store, a fish-    
 monger and a greengrocer, as well as  
 weekly deliveries from the Post Office
 and stores at Leigh.  A baker delivers
 three times per week and a milkman on 
 alternate days.                       
                                       
      Other services include a weekly  
{surgery}at Bensfield, with a system   
 for collecting prescriptions to be    
 made up at Malvern Link. The {mobile  
{library }comes monthly.               </content>
