		<title>03GRAVEL PITS OLD AND NEW.</title>
		<content> Gravel has been extracted from large  
 areas,leaving pits filled with        
 water.Some a natural habitat for      
 nature.Other pits are in the process  
 of being filled with refuse from local
 authority .Most of the rubbish dumped 
 is local household refuse,but a       
 section is provided for people who    
 wish to take their own                
 rubbish,unwanted furniture and other  
 items.The dump also includes a bottle 
 bank where they can be re-cycled.The  
 depots were originally at Marshfoot   
 and Baker Street,but the areas became 
 so untidy that they were transferred  
 to the old gravel pits.
