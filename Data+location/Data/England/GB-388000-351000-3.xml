		<title>03Working in Norton</title>
		<content>A questionnaire on the employment of   
Norton people showed that close to half
of the people who answered the         
questions were not employed, although  
this included both men and women.Of    
those people in employment the pottery 
industry employed most,just over 15%.  
Coal mining,once the dominant industry 
now only employs 2% of the workers,    
agriculture has also declined, with    
only 0.5% of our sample. A number of   
people (7%) work in shops, either      
locally or in the nearby Pottery towns 
whilst a further 10% work in offices,  
and 6% in engineering. But the most    
obvious result of our survey was the   
variety of jobs,there being well       
over 30 different jobs identified,     
this is probably a result of the       
closeness of a large city and the      
ease of communications.
