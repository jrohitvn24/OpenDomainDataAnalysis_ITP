 and co have been very busy preparing  
 the trailer park and driving piles    
 into the ground for the fixed access  
 bridge.The foundations for the        
 terminals different buildings are well
 underway.The aim for the DIFT's port  
 management(DPM)is to take management  
 of the ground as soon as              
 possible.Everthing that is coming into
 the DIFT area is either on schedule   
 or ahead of schedule.Because of this  
 the DIFT project should be ready on   
 the date they expect it to be ready.
