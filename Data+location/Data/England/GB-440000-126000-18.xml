		<content>  Some of the paths are bridleways ,   
 and increasing prosperity means that ,
 even in a motor age more people are   
 taking to horse-riding for pleasure . 
 But at Merdon Manor the stables have  
 been converted to garages ; Mr.Smith  
 has horses , but they are for breeding
 and kept at his stud farm elsewhere . 
 Other forms of exercise are popular   
 too , and the quiet lanes of the area 
 are used by cyclists and even joggers 
 from Winchester . Perhaps this is part
 of a general trend towards more       
 exercise as entertainment - Merdon    
 Manor now has an indoor swimming pool 
 but the billiard room has gone .
