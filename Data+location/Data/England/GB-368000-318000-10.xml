		<title>10LAND USE IN TIBBERTON</title>
		<content>   The farms used to rear{livestock,   
 sheep, pigs, and cattle; but many     
 changes have taken place, and now they
 concentrate mainly on{arable farming;}
 growing winter cereals, winter wheat, 
 winter barley, spring barley, oil-seed
 rape, potatoes, sugar beet and peas.  
   The land is very fertile and is able
 to grow most crops. The soil is fairly
 light and needs irrigation to get its 
 full potential.                       
   The farms do not have many animals, 
 so have to make use of{fertilizer.}The
 main type used is seaweed{fertilizer,}
 which is more natural than others.    
 Crop rotation is also used.           
   The largest field in Tibberton is   
 about 40 acres, which is much less    
 than fields in the east. Several scrub
 hedges have been removed.{            
   Tibberton Grange owns tied cottages 
 for farm worker.                      </content>
