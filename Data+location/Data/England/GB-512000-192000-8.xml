		<title>08MERRY HILL FARM, BUSHEY.</title>
		<content>{A farm has stood here for 200 years.  
{Upto 1920,hay was grown for London's  
{vast horse-drawn traffic. Between the 
{wars pigs were kept.In WW2, many stray
{bombs fell on the farm,including 2 V1.
 Today it is a mixed farm of 300 acres.
 75% is barley,rape,and hay.The rest is
 pasture for cattle.Every Spring,      
 beef cattle are bought,"fattened-up", 
 then sold in the Autumn.              
{The farmer,whose family has lived here
{since 1880,jokingly calls himself     
{"a stick-and-dog farmer".He and his   
{border collie are inseparable,and his 
{small herd of 35 is easily managed.   
 In his lifetime,technology has changed
  farming dramatically.His 2 tractors  
 "do everything".The largest and most  
 modern,has 32 gears,pulls 10 ploughs, 
 and allows him to drive in "armchair  
 comfort" in the wildest of weathers.
