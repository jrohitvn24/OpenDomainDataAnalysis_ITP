 After gravel was extracted from       
 Vicarage Pit Buckingshamshire,        
 Berkshire and Oxfordshire Naturalists 
 Trust (BBONT) bought the land and made
 it into a{nature reserve. }Visitors   
 are discouraged.                      
{FOOTPATHS}A lot of work has been done 
 by the Parish Council and villagers to
 open footpaths around the village.    
 Some local farmers had ploughed,      
 planted and fenced over them and they 
 were impassable.  Those open are 3, 4,
 7, 8 the Bridleway has always been    
 open. Much work to the north of the   
 village is needed but the farmer is   
 intransigent.                         
{CLIMATE}Mild, predominantly SW winds  
 1984 summer was very wet.  Snow rare, 
 but in 1984 village cut off for a day.
 Hedge removal by farmers one cause of 
 drifting snow.                        </content>
