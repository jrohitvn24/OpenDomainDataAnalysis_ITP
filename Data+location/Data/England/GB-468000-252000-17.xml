The village flower festival is an      
annual fund raising event for St Mary's
Church. Many people from the village   
produce individual flower arrangements 
to decorate the church - the end result
is breathtaking. People come from      
many miles around to see the display   
which is open to the public from       
Friday to Sunday during a weekend in   
May ( 2 weeks after May Day ).         
 During the time of the festival there 
is also an exhibition of paintings by  
a famous artist who lives in the       
village.                               
On the Saturday there is a mini-market 
on the village green with              
refreshments, a pets corner, and       
competitions for all the family.       
The flower festival usually raises over
1,000 pounds for the church.
