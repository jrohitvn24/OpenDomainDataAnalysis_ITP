		<content>{CROPWELL BUTLER, TITHBY &amp; WIVERTON.}  
 These three English/Scandinavian      
 villages were settled before 1086     
 (Domesday Book).  Cropwell Butler     
 derives its name from the adjacent Hoe
 Hill, Crophille-kropper (hump), Butler
 the Lordship of the Butlers of Warrin-
 gton.  Tithby, Tidhe's village, and   
 Wiverton, Wivre tun, O/E tun-town.    
 Wiverton Hall (listed), built in the  
 1840's incorporating the Gate House of
 the original Hall demolished in the   
 1640's, reverted to the Crown in 1938.
 It was occupied by the Army in 1939-45
 and sold by the Commissioners of Crown
 Lands in 1947 for Â£2000, sold again in
 1973 for Â£80,000 and since then has   
 been allowed to get into a dilapidated
 state. The land in front of the Hall, 
 consisting of a gun emplacement &amp; part
 of the original roadway to the Hall,  
 is Scheduled as an Ancient Monument.  </content>
