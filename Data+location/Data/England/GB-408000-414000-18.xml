		<title>18"A Funeral"</title>
		<content>    On Tuesday the 4th of June there   
 was a funeral, it was my grandmas. She
 was 85 years old when she died. We    
 drove to the funeral home in our car. 
    While we were there I went to see  
 my grandma and I kissed her. Then we  
 set off to the crematorium. My grandma
 was taken in a big black funeral car  
 called a hearse. All of my grandmas   
 relations and friends followed the    
 hearse to the crematorium.            
    There were a lot of flowers and    
 some bouquets. We said some prayers.  
 Then she was cremated. After that we  
 went for a meal with the family and   
 some friends. Then we all went home.  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
