		<title>09Tunnel System</title>
		<content>    A stone tunnel runs under a rough  
 grazing field in the SW of the block  
 and links onto a network in Welbeck.  
   This tunnel runs from "Nerves" the  
 main entrance to the tunnels at       
 Welbeck Abbey,up to Tunnel End Lodge  
 and on towards Worksop. It takes      
 it's name from the large number of    
 skylights along it's length.          
    It was constructed in the mid-late 
 19th century by the Fifth Duke of     
 Portland,who payed a large number of  
 the local unemployed to build it      
 simply to alleviate unemployment in   
 the area.                             
    The 5th Duke wanted the tunnel     
 built so that his carriage could leave
 the Welbeck Estates without being     
 seen,because he was a recluse. At the 
 end is Tunnel End Lodge where workers 
 were housed. Also a gate keeper opened
 the gates at the end of the tunnel.   </content>
