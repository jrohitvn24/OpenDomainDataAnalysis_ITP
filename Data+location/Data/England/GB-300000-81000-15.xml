		<title>15Planning our Questionnaire</title>
		<content> We planned a questionnaire to find out
 what children at Brixington Junior    
 School thought of living in this      
 area.190 children out of 240 answered 
 our questions. One third of children  
 at our school have a father serving in
 the Royal Marines at Lympstone and    
 these families move around the country
 a lot. We wanted to find out more     
 about houses in our catchment area;   
 also, what children really think of   
 this part of Exmouth. There were 32   
 questions on the sheet. Here are the  
 most important: 1)Where were you born?
 2)Where were your Mother and Father   
 born? 3)How long have you lived in    
 Exmouth? 4)What type of house do you  
 live in? 5)How many bedrooms has it ? 
 6)Which firm built it and when? 7)Have
 you got a car? 8)Which other          
 facilities would you like to see in   
 this area? The Results are on Page 16.</content>
