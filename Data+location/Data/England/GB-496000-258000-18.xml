		<title>18Sharnbrook House.</title>
		<content> At a time when{the elderly represent  
{an increasing percentage of the       
{population,}Sharnbrook House plays its
 part in caring for them.              
 The house, a Grade 2 listed building, 
 has been a{W.R.V.S. residential club  
{for the elderly}since 1951.           
 Under the direction of a warden, a    
 domestic staff, care assistants and a 
 nurse, minister to their needs.       
 Residents come and go as they please, 
 and every effort is made to integrate 
 them into the life of the village.    
 Weekly church services are held.      
 Garden parties and other functions    
 bring outsiders into contact with the 
 residents.                            
 Administration is by a voluntary      
 committee, each member of which has a 
 specific managerial resposibility, and
 a desire to create a carefree life for
 the residents.                        </content>
