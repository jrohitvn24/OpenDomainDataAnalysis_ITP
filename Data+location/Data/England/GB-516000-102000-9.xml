		<title>09LOCAL HISTORY LANCING 1945</title>
		<content> We interviewed Mr.Rickard who lives at
 64 Pratten Avenue.He had some very    
 interesting memories of Lancing around
 1945.It was a lovely village between  
 Worthing and Shoreham,with a          
 population of about 9_11,000.Monks    
 Recreation ground used to be a cabbage
 patch.There were only 4 postmen in the
 whole of Lancing at the time.There was
 a little shed behind the Merry Monk   
 pub whitch used to be the post office 
 but then it moved to where the Midland
  Bank is know.The police station      
 was just a house with only two        
 policemen.The sergeant was Mr.Willams 
 and his wife was the midwife of       
 Lancing.The only school in our block  
 at the time was south Lancing.Lancing 
 was the biggest village then and still
 is in England.It had lots of nurseries
 growing tomatoes,cauliflowers and     
 carnations.                           </content>
