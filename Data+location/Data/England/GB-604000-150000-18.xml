		<title>18LANDSCAPE OF GODMERSHAM</title>
		<content> The landscape of Godmersham is        
 dominated by the hills and woods of   
 the North Downs and the River Stour   
 flowing in a long valley running SW to
 NE. It is a chalk stream for most of  
 its length, important for drainage,   
 conservation, angling and water-usage.
 The village lies in a small part of   
 the valley with a railway and road    
 running through it.                   
 On the N side Kings Wood and Challock 
 Forest predominate with the North     
 Downs Way running through them        
 The hill behind the church shows      
 pre-medieval systems of agriculture.  
 On the S side are smaller parcels     
 of woodland, Purrs Wood and Chilham   
 Downs and on the N boundary the old   
 road to Chilham, with some old        
 cottages known as Mountain Street.    
 To the E is an early British burial   
 mound possibly of a Roman general.    </content>
