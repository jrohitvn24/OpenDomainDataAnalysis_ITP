		<content> Education in the area is the          
 responsibility of Merton and Sutton   
 Local Education Authorities. Merton   
 has Primary(5-9),Middle(9-13)and High 
 (13-18)Schools, while in Sutton pupils
 change schools at the age of 11.      
 The Merton Schools include St.Teresa's
 Primary,Malmesbury Middle,            
 St.Catherine's Middle, Garth High and 
 Willows High School all of which are  
 part of a Comprehensive system.Several
 of the schools were built in the      
 1930's to co-incide with the          
 development of the St. Helier Estate. 
 St.Teresa's and St.Catherine's are two
 of the Catholic schools in Merton.    
 Sutton schools include Cheam Park Farm
 and Tweeddale Primaries, Gaynesford   
 High and the only Comprehensive school
 in Sutton, Greenshaw High.Gaynesford

 in August 1985.                       </content>
