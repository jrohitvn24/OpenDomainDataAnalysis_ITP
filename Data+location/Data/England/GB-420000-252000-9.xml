		<title>09HOLY TRINITY CHOIR</title>
		<content> I am in the church choir at Holy      
 Trinity Church,Stratford _ on _Avon.We
 wear special clothes like cassocks,   
 surplices and ruffs.We also have      
 ribbons to show how high up in the    
 choir we are.The choristers have teams
 (Hathaway,Nash,Hall and Shakespeare)  
 and we have thick dark blue ribbons if
 we are team leaders.The order of the  
 church serice goes like this_first we 
 process in and bow down and sit down. 
 After that the rector publishes the   
 banns of marriage.Then we sing setting
 and have gospel and sermons.We then   
 have the sacrament while the choir    
 sing anthems in the chancel in front  
 of Shakespeare's tomb.Then we sing a  
 hymn and process out. At the end of a 
 wedding we get about Â£3.00 each for   
 just singing three hymns.At the end of
 a term we get about Â£10.00.
