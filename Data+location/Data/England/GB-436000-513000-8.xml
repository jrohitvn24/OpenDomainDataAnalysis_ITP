		<content>    Teesside airport was developed here
 because the land was flat, away from  
 the towns and was an old RAF station, 
 and it opened as a civil airport in   
 1960.                                 
    Most flights are internal and go to
 London, Norwich, Humberside, Glasgow  
 and Inverness. There are 67 internal  
 flights per week and only 37 inter-   
 national ones, flying to Belfast,     
 Bergen, Stavanger, Esbjerg, Amsterdam 
 and Berlin.                           
    During the summer, additional      
 holiday flights go to Spain, Germany, 
 Holland and Yugoslavia.               
    As the airport expanded a railway  
 station was built. Whilst further     
 expansion is possible on existing     
 owned land, current national policies 
 do not favour provincial development.
