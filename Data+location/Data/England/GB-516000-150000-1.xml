		<content>   This area is on the edge of Dorking 
 Town and also takes in the small      
 communities of West Humble,Pixham and 
 Box Hill.It is easily reached by road 
 and rail and as a result a few large  
 firms have set up offices near the    
 railway station.The{housing}in the    
 area is nearly all low density,       
 shopping facilities are few and the   
 inhabitants are employed either       
 locally or may commute to London.The  
 most important aspect of the area is  
 it's{Natural Beauty.}Much of it is    
 either National Trust land (wooded or 
 grassy slopes) or farmland lying in   
 the gap made by the River Mole through
 the{North Downs}and by that part of   
 the Downs called Box Hill.The         
 countryside is used by many people    
 seeking{recreation,}walkers,cyclists  
 ,horse riders etc.
