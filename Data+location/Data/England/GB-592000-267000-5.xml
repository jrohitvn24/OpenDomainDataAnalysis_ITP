		<content>Queach Farm was recently arrested.     
The police are called to many quarrels 
and disputes between husbands and wives
,and between neighbours.There are far  
fewer road accidents on the smaller    
roads than on the main roads.          
The P.C. told us that Pakenham is      
difficult to patrol, being the largest 
parish in Suffolk.He said that the     
worst part of the job was infoming next
of kin of the death of their love      
ones.The best part was catching a crook
after a long search and being able to  
help people with  their problems .He   
said that being able to help people who
are locked out , lost or in some way   
distressed took about 1/4 of their     
time.They would be more available to   
local people when bikes are used       
again.At present there is insufficient 
manpower to allow for this.
