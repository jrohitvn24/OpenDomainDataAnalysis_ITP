		<title>06POPULATION OF SOUTHREPPS</title>
		<content> Population approx. 750: rather less   
 than a century ago, surprising in     
 view of all the new housing. Then     
 cottages were small, families large - 
 one block of 6 cottages housed 30     
 people, now 3 cottages housing 8.     
 Within living memory farming and      
 associated crafts predominated - less 
 so today. People from other areas have
 retired here. New familes moving in,  
 working in Norwich or market towns,   
 the gas or oil industry or welfare    
 services. All this helps mould a      
 growing and diverse village, with     
 clubs and activities assisting        
 integration. Most important are local 
 jobs and business compatible with the 
 area. Southrepps has always had       
 diverse small businesses, more now    
 than a decade ago.
