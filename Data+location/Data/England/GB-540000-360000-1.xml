		<content> Most of the area is drained fen. The  
 northern edge is slightly higher      
 glacial drift. Fenlands are almost    
 entirely arable. Cereal crops dominate
 but potatoes and brassicas are also   
 important. The grasslands on the drift
 soils at Little Steeping and Toynton  
 support cattle and sheep. Around      
 Toynton and Steeping fields are small 
 hedges some rich in species and of    
 gratage but fenland fields are large  
 and hedgeless. Fenland farms are large
 and highly mechanised the mixed farms 
 are small family units.  The peat     
 soils on the fens are eroding rapidly.
 Straw burning is almmost universal on 
 cereal fields causing many complaints.

 burning have been adhered to but      
 nuisance persists.Low house prices    
 have attracted retired people nd
