		<content>   Most of our D-block was farming     
 land. It contains the hamlet of{WALTON
   In the amenities count there was    
 only 1 Church and no other amenities. 
   The survey was conducted by first   
 year junior children from Wellesbourne
 School. The village of{WELLESBOURNE}  
 lies at the intersection of 4         
 D-blocks. Only a few houses from      
 Wellesbourne come in the D-block that 
 we were given.                        
   Except for pages 2 and 3, the       
 writing is about the children's own   
 experiences in the village of         
 Wellesbourne.
