		<content> St.Helen's School was 150 years old in
 July 1985. We all dressed up in       
 Victorian costume. We walked to school
 quickly trying not to notice the eyes 
 staring at us. The bell rang so we all
 lined up to go to church. The vicar   
 took a Victorian service and then we  
 went back to school for lessons in the
 3'R'S'-reading,writing and arithmetic.
 In the afternoon we had a Victorian   
 sports day, planted a tree, played old
 fashioned games and, best of all a    
 picnic with a very big cake which one 
 of the parents donated. At the end we 
 sang old songs.We had a wonderful time
 and for once this year, a lovely warm 
 day. The next day we did all Victorian
 lessons and our teacher was very      
 strict. It was rather frightening     
 especially as he had a big stick.
