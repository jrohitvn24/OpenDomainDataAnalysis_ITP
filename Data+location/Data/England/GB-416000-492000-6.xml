		<content>     Our school was{established in 1878
 to serve the above villages.  Over 100
 children were  once  taught in the two
 classrooms. Today they are occupied by
 only {27 primary pupils and two staff,
 but are full of lots of books,  modern
 equipment and visual aids to help us. 
    I like Maths, English, Swimming and
 Topic best. We  all  swim at  Richmond
 Baths. Last year 3 classes gained gold
 medals in the Dolphin Trophy. Our mums
 help with cars  on such outings.  Some
 of my class  had never been on a train
 before March 85. We went to London for
 the day to see  the Egyptian treasures
 in the British Museum.                
    Our{canteen}is  behind  the school.
 All but two of us eat here daily.  Hot
 meals, 67p per day, are  delivered  by
 taxi.Twelve children eat packed lunch.
 We have two dinner ladies, a caretaker
 and a clerical assistant.             </content>
