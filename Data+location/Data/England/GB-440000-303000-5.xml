 Barlestone how they spent their spare 
 time.Half of the 70 people belonged to
 a club or group in Barlestone.Most    
 people went out of the village during 
 the weekend,this was especially true  
 for the young people.For their        
 holidays 33% went abroad,33% went     
 somewhere in Britain,34% stayed at    
 home.                                 
   In Mkt. Bosworth there is a squash  
 club,a bowls club and a shooting club.
 The Community Centre in the school    
 offers a wide range of sporting       
 activities such as                    
 Badminton,Tennis,Archery and

 and Rugby teams.
