		<content>{Blackbushe Airfield}was built in World
 War Two, as a light bomber aerodrome. 
 Today it is privately owned by British
 Car Auctions. A collection of old     
 aircraft is being disbanded at the    
 moment,and two other areas are set    
 aside; one for a Sunday Market, the   
 other for a private flying club. This 
 provides trial lessons for pleasure,  
 and aerobatic flights. The price of   
 the lessons varies from Â£20- Â£60. The 
 club's main aim is to train people for
 their private pilot's licence ,but it 
 is also a membership club, with about 
 400 members. Most of the planes flown 
 are Cessnas,but there are several     
 helicopters. The club has some        
 military connections running courses  
 for the Military Academy at Sandhurst.
