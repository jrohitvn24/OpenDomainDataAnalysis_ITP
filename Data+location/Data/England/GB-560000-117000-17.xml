		<title>17Life Styles in Warbleton</title>
		<content> With no schools and little employment 
 in the area nearly all families below 
 retirement age depend daily on        
 motorised transport. Children are     
 largely dependent on parents for      
 transport. Visits by tradespeople are 
 important for the housebound.         
 Newspapers and mail are delivered     
 daily, bread twice weekly and the     
 milkman calls on alternate days. The  
 mobile library from Lewes visits      
 Rushlake Green weekly. Most families  
 visit larger towns for shopping       
 preferring freshness, variety and     
 cheaper prices which village shops    
 cannot offer. For Post Office services
 many prefer to avoid the inevitable   
 queues in the larger town offices.    
 Life in this area in the past has been
 extensively studied by the Warbleton &amp;
 Distric History Group who have        
 produced several publications.        </content>
