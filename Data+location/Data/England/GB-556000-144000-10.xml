		<content> The River Medway runs through our     
 town.It is used by many people for    
 fishing,boating and canoeing but some 
 people think it should be used more   
 extensivly.                           
 Next to the river is the park,apart   
 from sports,the park has play areas   
 for children,gardens for people to    
 enjoy.In the park The Castle,a Norman 
 ruin,is worth visiting.There is a     
 small museum inside the castle which  
 runs a small guided tour.             
 In Tonbridge there are many clubs and 
 societies. For the younger generation 
 clubs such as Cubs,Scouts,Brownies and
 Guides.For the older people there are 
 clubs which cater for gardening and   
 day centres etc.
