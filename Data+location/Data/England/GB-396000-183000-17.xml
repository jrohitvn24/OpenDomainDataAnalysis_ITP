		<content>   Hedges have lots of uses.Animals use
 them for homes and shelter.Farmers    
 need them to divide their land and pen
 in their livestock.They also prevent  
 the wind from blowing away the top    
 soil.Some farmers,however,would rather
 remove the hedges to gain more land   
 for their crops.But this would alter  
 the environment and harm wildlife as  
 hedges also play an important part in 
 the food-chain.For example,the loss of
 hedges would lead to the death of     
 hedge-sparrows and then in turn the   
 extinction of Sparrow-hawks and other 
 birds of prey.                        
   The laying of hedges has always been
 a winter task, partly because the task
 is easier when there is no foliage.   
 When laying the hawthorn it is trimmed
 and the main stems are cut half       
 through near the base and then bent   
 over to a low angle.                  </content>
