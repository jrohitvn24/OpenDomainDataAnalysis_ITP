		<title>11Ecology - Flora of the Downs</title>
		<content>Kemsing Nature Reserve and Cockney's   
Wood is a small area of the North Downs
where there are wild flowers of every  
description. One of the most unusual is
the {Orchid} of which ten varieties    
have been seen in the past 85 years.   
The chalky escarpment interspersed with
woodland is ideal for their growth. Man
orchid,Bee,Common Spotted orchis,      
Pyramid, Fragrant and the Twayblade    
orchis have all been sighted in 1985.  
Other unusual orchids which are        
sometimes seen are the Helleborine,    
Bird's Nest and Butterfly orchids.     
Orchids are mostly about the size of a 
bluebell, often with spotted leaves and
those mentioned here are all pink or   
yellow/brown in colour.                
In Cockney's Wood deposits of chalk    
have produced the correct habitat for  
the more common orchids. They are a    
protected species of plant.            </content>
