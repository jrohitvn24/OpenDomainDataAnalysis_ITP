		<content>  At the turn of the century Hedge End 
 was a small village surrounded by farm
 lands.                                
 Today it is still a large village and 
 still growing fast. Population in 1971
 was 9050.                             
 In 1978 the Hedge End section of the  
 M.27 motorway was opened and the      
 village has quick and easy access to  
 neighbouring towns such as            
 Southampton, Eastleigh and Fareham.   
 There are few large industries in     
 Hedge End. Most job opportunities are 
 in shops and public services.
