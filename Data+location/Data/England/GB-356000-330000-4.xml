		<content> At Abbey Farm Applebys make (with the 
 help of others){Cheshire and Double   
{Gloucester cheese}from  300{Friesian  
 cows.600 gallons of the 1000 gallons  
 of milk is sent to the{cheese}room by 
 pipe line to be made into cheese.There
 is a watery mixture called whey from  
 the cheese which is sent through pipes
 into a big tank.It is then fed to the 
 400{pigs.}When the pigs weigh 200lbs  
 they were sold for{pork and bacon.}The
{cows}are milked twice a day,6-30am un-
 til 9-00am and 3-30pm until 6-00pm.The
 rotary parlour holds 20 cows at a ti- 
 me.In the winter the cows are kept in 
 sheds away from the bitter cold weath-
 er.They are fed on{barley and silage} 
 in the winter and they have barley and
 grass from the fields in the Summer.  
 Each cow has a number which is typed  
 into a{computer}which gives them the  
 right amount of corn in the parlour.  </content>
