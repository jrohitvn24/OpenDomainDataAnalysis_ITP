		<title>17A CLITHEROE MUM'S DAY</title>
		<content>    My mum's day starts when my dad    
 brings her a cup of tea. My mum then  
 gets me up, makes my breakfast and    
 prepares my packed lunch, then sees me
 off to school. She then washes the    
 pots from breakfast, makes the beds   
 and tidies my bedroom. After she has  
 loaded the washer with dirty clothes, 
 she hoovers and polishes around the   
 house.                                
    At about 12.30 p.m. she has her    
 lunch which lasts between half an hour
 and one hour depending on how busy she
 is. When lunch is over, she takes our 
 dog Sue out for a walk then goes into 
 town to do some shopping but she is   
 always home for when I get home from  
 school at 4.00 p.m. After we have     
 washed up after tea she sits down to  
 watch the news. Quite often she has   
 meetings to attend. At about 11.00    
 p.m. she goes to bed.                 </content>
