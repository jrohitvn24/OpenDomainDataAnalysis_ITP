		<title>02THE RIVER BRAY</title>
		<content> The{River Bray}flows in a North/South 
 direction through the eastern part of 
 this area. It rises on{Exmoor}and     
 flows into the{River Mole}at the very 
 south of our area. it is not a very   
 big river. It is only about 5 metres  
 across. It is not very deep. There are
 fields on each side of the river for  
 cattle and sheep. One field has       
 potatoes growing in it this year.     
 There is one mill on the river at     
{Clapworthy.}It used to be a grain     
 mill. Then it became a cider mill. It 
 is still a cider mill but they don't  
 use the water to turn the mill wheel. 
 There used to be another mill at Bray 
 Bridge.                               
 There are two roads going over the    
 river. One carries the main road to   
 Exeter from South Molton. The other   
 carries the Torrington road from South
 Molton. We live off this road.        </content>
