		<content> The Priory Church - Present Day       
    On average  150 people go to       
 services in our church every week.The 
 choir has 16 members. There are 5     
 services a week and about 6           
 christenings,6 weddings and 6 funerals
 a year. It costs  Â£9,000 a year to    
 run the church, excluding repairs. The
  Church Council is  an elected        
 committee, formed to help with the    
 running and mission of the church.    
    Being formally a priory, it is     
 larger than most churches, and        
  visitors come in their hundreds every
 year. Their donations help to keep the
 church going. There are also concerts 
 throughout the year, an during the    
 summer ,choirs from all over the      
 country perform in the week-long      
 Edington festival-one service always  
 being brodcasted on the radio.The     
 present vicar is  Rev Maurice Bird.   </content>
