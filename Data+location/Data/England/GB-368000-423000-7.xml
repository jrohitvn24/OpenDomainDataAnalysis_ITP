		<content>   Each day begins with prayer. Without
 prayer everything done in{my}strength 
 alone will always let me down.        
   A phone call-Mrs.Jones asking me to 
 visit her mother who is depressed.    
   I write a few letters-one asking a  
 local company for help in restyling   
 the graveyard-an ever present trouble!
   Another phone call-a couple wanting 
 to be married-interrupted by a knock  
 at the door-it's{a tramp}with a hard  
 luck story.We make sandwiches for him,
 ask him to do some weeding and give   
 him Â£2.                               
   Next a visit to Mr.X who has a      
 problem with his daughter followed by 
 a{baptism}call on the Estate-and a    
 welcome cup of tea!                   
   I spend an hour preparing a talk for
 weekend then call on Mrs.Y who has    
 cancer.We pray together and enjoy a   
 laugh.Life is hectic but it's great!  </content>
