		<content> The village of Chaddesley Corbett is  
 an ancient settlement with a          
 prehistoric buriel mound and traces of
 a Roman road. Originally known as     
 Chaddesley the name is thought to mean
 "Ceadda's clearing in the wood" and is
 first mentioned in a Saxon Charter of 
 816 when the land was given to the    
 Bishop of Worcester in return for     
 hospitality to the King of Mercia and 
 his men. It is mentioned in the       
 Domesday Book as belonging to a Saxon 
 Noblewoman, and had two priests,      
 several corn mills, a population as   
 large as Kidderminster and two        
 saltpans in Droitwich for it's own    
 use. After the Norman C onquest the   
 Manor of Chaddesley was owned by the  
 Corbett family who added their name.  
 Later church lands passed to the      
 Earldom of Warwick and eventually to  
 the Throckmortons of Coughton Court.  </content>
