 There are significant open spaces in  
 our area, the village of Preston has a
 large recreation field which was      
 opened in the mid 1970's.  The village
 has a playground and sports pavilion  
 on the recreation field.              
 Within the grounds of the local       
 secondary school there is a large     
 sports hall which is jointly run by   
 the Humberside Local Education        
 Authority and the Holderness District 
 Council.  A sports hall and swimming  
 pool provide a very good athletics    
 facility.                             
 Clubs that are organised are the YFC, 
 the WI, Scouts and Guides, as well as 
 a large council organised Youth Club  
 at the local secondary school.
