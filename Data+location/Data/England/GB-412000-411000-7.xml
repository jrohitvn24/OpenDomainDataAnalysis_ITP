		<title>07HONLEY SHOW</title>
		<content>   Honley Show is held on the 2nd      
 Saturday in June. At the Show there   
 are different animals; shire-horses,  
 ponies, sheep, rabbits, dogs, goats   
 and many more. In the marquees there  
 are refreshments, ice-creams and the  
 tantalizing odour of hot-dogs and     
 beef-burgers.                         
   Some people come just for the       
 enjoyment and fun, but others come for
 prizes and rosettes. Show jumping is  
 a feature of the show, as indeed is   
 the amusing joke-shop.                
   The show has a reputed guarantee of 
 inclement weather. However, the last  
 two occasions have been fine.         
   The Honley Show, which has much to  
 delight the whole family, is held in  
 the fields nestled between the Meltham
 Road and Bradshaw Road.
