		<title>12OLDEST INHABITANT</title>
		<content> An old lady lives up Scottlethorpe all
 by herself.Her house is not a         
 bungalow.It is a two storey house.The 
 rooms are quite small and she does'nt 
 have electricity.She uses coke and    
 wood to light her fire.She puts her   
 kettle and food on a kind of grill and
 it cooks.She has got a garden with    
 grass and apple trees in it.She grows 
 pumpkins and our goat used to eat the 
 grass in her garden because she did   
 not have a lawnmower.She has got a    
 fence and a gate and a small shed.She 
 has got a lot of brass objects and a  
 copper kettle.Sometimes the owner of  
 the shop next to the post-office      
 delivers ice-cream and things like    
 that down to her when she has run out 
 of them.Perhaps they deliver paraffin 
 to her aswell so that she can light   
 her oil-lamp.We believe that she is 87
 years old.                            </content>
