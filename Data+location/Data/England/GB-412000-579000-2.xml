		<title>02THE POPULATION OF WHALTON</title>
		<content> This survey block has a population    
 of around{215}of which{158}live in    
 Whalton village itself.  Of the       
 total people living in this survey    
 block,{58}are over 65 years old,      
 whilst only{36}are under 18. In former
 times most villagers worked in the    
 immediate vicinity but now only{31}   
 people are employed in and around the 
 village, almost all in agriculture.   
                                       
 Housing is particularly expensive in  
 Whalton because of it being an        
 attractive, rural village within easy 
 travelling distance of the Tyneside   
 conurbation. Consequently houses are  
 frequently sold to professional       
 families from outside rather than to  
 young people from the village itself.
