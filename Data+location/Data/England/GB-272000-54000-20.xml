		<title>20HOUSES IN DIPTFORD</title>
		<content> The slate quarries of Diptford        
 provided the local people with a means
 of building their houses. Many houses 
 are built of{slate}and reflect the    
 character of the area. Modern building
 materials have meant the introduction 
 of new ideas and styles. The most     
 popular being the{bungalow.}Planning  
 restrictions have also determined the 
 style and materials used. Modern      
 bungalows have interiors of a opened  
 planned nature and because we have no 
 gas in Diptford are{heated}by         
 electricity or log burning stoves.    
 Gardens are spacious and dotted with  
 trees. The garage is a feature is of  
 this day and age and is often built   
 for two cars. The farm houses still   
 dot the landscape and  nestle in the  
 valleys.
