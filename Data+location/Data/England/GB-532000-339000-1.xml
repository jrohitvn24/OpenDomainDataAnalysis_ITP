		<content>       {Our Area}                      
   Our twelve kilometre square consists
 mainly of farmland.In the North West  
 corner it is crossed by a disused     
 railway line.This railway line used to
 run from Boston to Spalding but was   
 closed in 1970.The disused line is now
 overgrown and makes an excellent place
 for watching birds and other wildlife 
 .There are plans to build a new road  
  from Sutterton to Boston following   
 the route of the old railway line.This
 work is to begin autumn 1985.         
   There are two main settlements in   
 the area.These are the villages of    
{Wyberton}and{Frampton.}Both are old   
 villages which have grown considerably
 in the last twenty years.The original 
 village of Wyberton is clustered      
 around St.Leodegar's church while a   
 new section of the village has grown  
 up on the A16.                        </content>
