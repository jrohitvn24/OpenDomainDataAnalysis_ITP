 was the last member of an old Cornish 
 family who had lived at Penrice House,
 Porthpean for 300 years.She was born a
 Graves-Sawle and married a colonel    
 Cobbold who was in the army.She dearly
 loved her home,but was known throug   
 hout the area for her public spirit   
 and her dedication to good works.She  
 was the chief benefactor for many     
 worthy causes,including the addition  
 of a spire to Charlestown church,where
 she worshipped regularly.Her chief    
 love was old people,however.In her    
 will she left Penrice House to

 for the rest of their lives in        
 pleasant surroundings".In the creation
 of this home for others,her spirit    
 remains alive &amp; carries on its good   
 work.
