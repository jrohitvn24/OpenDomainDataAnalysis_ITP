 On the yard there are games painted,  
 such as a snake and two hopscotches.  
 There are four drains.We play British 
 Chasey and people bring toys out to   
 play with.British is a game where     
 someone is picked to be on.He or she  
 goes and stands about a yard away from
 the rest of the people.they go and    
 stand on a line which is near the top 
 of the yard.The children yell the     
 person who's on's name and then he    
 picks somebody.They then run down to  
 the other side of the yard.The person 
 who's on has to catch the person who  
 ran down.If he's caught,he picks      
 someone and the game goes on.If he    
 gets across,everybody else runs down  
 and tries to get across.
