		<content>        {Positive Aspects.}            
   The creation of a park in the 1840's
 was  a revolutionary  idea.  Low-lying
 marshland  was  reclaimed  at  public 
 expense to  create a famous park,  the
 inspiration  for  New  York's  Central
 Park. An achievment in many ways; this
 captured a piece of Wirral countryside
 and  preserved  it. Today  it is still
 beautiful and much visited.           
        {Negative Aspects.             
   Dutch elm disease  wiped out a large
 number  of  trees,  and  saplings  now
 being planted are  under  threat  from
 vandals. Litter and dumped rubbish are
 problems.   Unsupervised  dogs  chase 
 ducks.  Children  slide  down  hills  
 damaging grass. Airguns are a problem.
 Comments  about  the  park  include:- 
 "Neglected", "In need of restoration",
 "It should be returned  to it's former
 glory as the showpiece of the town."  </content>
