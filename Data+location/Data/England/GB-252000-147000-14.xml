		<title>14  WE BELONG TO THE CUBS</title>
		<content> Our cub pack has 32 boys aged between 
 8 and 10 years old.It is divided into 
 two packs the bears and the lions.The 
 lions meet on Wednesday and the bears 
 meet on Thursday in the cub hall.Our  
 uniform has a blue and green scarf,   
 the blue stands for water and the     
 green stands for land.The lions have a
 lady Akela and the bears have a man   
 Akela who are in charge.We have a     
 grand howl at the beginning and the   
 end of the meeting when we sit round  
 in a circle.We work for badges and a  
 bronze,silver and gold arrow.I am     
 James and I am working for my photo-  
 graphy badge and Colin has just earnt 
 his artists badge.We go out to track  
 and cook and we also go away to camp  
 and have cooking competitions.We enjoy
 playing cub games like elephant,storm-
 troopers and rebels and British bull- 
 dog.                                  </content>
