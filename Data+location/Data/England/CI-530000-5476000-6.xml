    The Bailiwick is served by three   
 main media services. The Guernsey     
 Evening Press is a daily paper        
 reporting all aspects of island life.A
 weekly summary of events is published 
 on a Saturday. This paper is          
 frequently sent to expatriots as a    
 means of keeping in touch with island 
 life. Channel Television serves Jersey
 as well as the Bailiwick. Programmes  
 are broadcast from that island, but   
 some are made at the local studio. In 
 the last year BBC local radio has     
 expanded to include a stereo service  
 on the local station. News items of   
 local interest are broadcast together 
 with feature articles and music. Radio
 Guernsey has the distinction of the   
 largest listening percentage in the   
 British Isles.                        </content>
