		<title>19GHOSTS IN SHERBORNE</title>
		<content> Lord Digby's old house is now a school
 for girls. It has been haunted by the 
 Blue Lady for many years. Dorset's own
 dialect poet, William Barnes, claimed 
 in one of his poems, that he didn't   
 only hear the ghost but he "zee'd     
 un " as well. Within the last 25 yrs 2
 school caretakers have seen her. Many 
 local people believe that she still   
 trips daintily about the house,usually
 near the staircase.                   
   Other Sherborne ghosts are :        
  Two ghostly monks have been seen     
 passing through the door of Sherborne 
 Abbey.                                
  The haunted tunnel under Long Street.
  In a part of Newland 2 black figures 
 have been seen.                       
  Near Castleton Church a ghostly old  
 smith works at his anvil.             
                                       
                                       </content>
