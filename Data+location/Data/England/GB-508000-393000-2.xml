		<content>   The Claxby/Usselby area is in north 
 Lincolnshire on the edge of the       
 Lincoln wolds, situated approximately 
 18 miles south west of Grimsby and 23 
 miles north east of Lincoln. The      
 Cleethorpes - Newark railway and A46  
 trunk road run through the area and   
 separate the two villages of Claxby   
 and Usselby. The area is mainly flat  
 agricultural land at approximately    
 100-125 feet A.O.D. rising sharply to 
 higher grazing land in the east at 530
 feet. This higher land formed by a    
 limestone edge is the western         
 extremity of the Lincolnshire wolds.  
   The population is small and mainly  
 concentrated in the two villages but  
 there are also several outlying farms.
