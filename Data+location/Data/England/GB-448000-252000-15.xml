		<title>15HOUSING AROUND BYFIELD</title>
		<content>WE FOUND THAT MOST PEOPLE IN OUR AREA  
HAVE MODERN HOUSES.EVEN THOUGH ONLY A  
FEW OWN OLD ONES,OLD HOUSES ARE BY FAR 
THE MOST PREFERED.MOST PEOPLE MOVED TO 
BYFIELD BECAUSE THEY LIKED THE AREA,   
WHILST SOME SIMPLY CAME WITH THEIR     
FAMILIES AND A FEW BECAUSE OF THEIR    
JOBS.ANY MORE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN   
BYFIELD IS UNPOPULAR IN THE VILLAGE.   
ONLY ONE PERSON OUT OF THE 16 THAT WE  
ASKED THOUGHT THERE SHOULD BE ANY.     
FINALLY WE ASKED PEOPLE WHAT THEY      
THOUGHT OF MODERN HOUSING ESTATES.THEY 
WERE NOT VERY POPULAR AND SOME THOUGHT 
THAT THEY WERE UNIMAGINATIVE.THE PARISH
OF BODDINGTON,DIVIDED INTO 2 VILLAGES, 
UPPER AND LOWER,CONSISTS OF ABOUT 250  
HOUSES IN A WIDE VARIETY OF STYLES.    
THE PRESENT POLICY OF ALLOWING         
IN-FILLING WITHIN THE VILLAGES HAS     
PRODUCED A RAPID BOOM IN BUILDING      
BRINGING IN MANY NEW RESIDENTS.        </content>
