		<title>11School Summer Fayre</title>
		<content> On the 13th July 1985 there was a busy
 atmosphere at the schools. Lots of    
 people came to help with the floats.  
 The fayre began with a carnival       
 procession consisting of four floats, 
 one for the Gala Queen, one for       
 the brownies, one for the playgroup   
 and one for anybody else who wanted to
 go on it. After going through         
 Mattersey the floats came back to     
 school. As they arrived the Harworth  
 Colliery Welfare Band started playing.
 After the Gala Queen and attendents   
 had met the Mayor of Retford, the     
 grand opening of the summer fayre     
 started with a speech by the Mayor and
 the fancy dress competition. Then we  
 had the sideshows and the band played 
 again. At 2.45 pm the school children 
 did some maypole dancing which was    
 followed by a keep fit display by the 
 ladies of Ranskill Keep Fit Club.     </content>
