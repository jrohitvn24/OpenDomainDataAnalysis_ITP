		<content> The{inshore waters}of the Solway Firth
 are recognised{fish breeding}and      
 nursery grounds. Only small inshore   
 boats, of less than 45 feet, are      
 allowed to fish within the Sea        
 Fisheries District of Cumbria which   
 extends from Meikle Ross in Scotland  
 to St Bees Head in England.           
 This District is controlled by Cumbria
 County Council, who enforce the       
 Byelaws and carry out sampling with   
 the aid of a{protection vessel,}the   
 'Solway Protector'. This vessel, with 
 a crew of two, is a 40" twin screw    
 patrol boat and is based at           
 Workington Harbour.                   
 The majority of fishermen are         
 part-time and use the Harbour as their
 base. Catches include cod, herring,   
 skate, dabs, lobster, crabs, shrimps  
 and prawns. Fisherman complain that   
 inshore{pollution}is a problem.       </content>
