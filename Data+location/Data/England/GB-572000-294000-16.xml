		<content>      Adult leisure time in Methwold.  
   I asked a neighbour some questions  
 about the way she spends her leisure  
 time.She enjoys playing tennis but    
 doesn't watch sport on television. I  
 asked what her favourite television   
 programme was, and she decided it was 
 "Coronation Street".She enjoys        
 gardening, but most of all she likes  
 doing crosswords in her spare time.   
    In our survey about the way adults 
 spend their leisure time we discovered
 that the most popular pastimes are    
 gardening,reading and watching        
 television.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
