		<title>09SHOOTING SCHOOL NEAR ANDOVER</title>
		<content>     Set in the heart of one of the    
 main game-shooting counties in the    
 country, business is brisk at the     
{Apsley Shooting Ground.               
     From their base, at the bottom of 
 a deep disused railway cutting, a team
 of five keeps the school open for{six 
{days a week all the year round}to meet
 the growing demand for{Game Shooting  
 tuition. And all types of pupil are   
 catered for: from the youngster given 
 a set of lessons as a birthday        
 present, to the experienced sportsman 
 wishing to "get his eye in" before the
 season begins; from the busy company  
 executive relaxing from the pressures 
 of work, to the old local for whom    
 shooting is as much part of life as   
 the passing seasons. But, whoever you 
 are, you will have one thing in common
 with the rest for, a growing sport it 
 may be, but it is certainly not cheap.</content>
