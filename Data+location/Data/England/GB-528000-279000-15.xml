		<title>15THE VILLAGE SIGN,WARBOYS</title>
		<content> The {village sign}is in the centre of 
 the village at the Y-junction. It is  
 in front of the pond called the weir  
 (pronounced "ware").                  
 In 1980 a group from the Women's      
 Institute thought that it would be    
 good if the village could have a      
 village sign. A meeting was held and  
 it was agreed to go ahead and raise   
 money. Money ws raised by holding     
 jumble sales,coffee mornings,bingo and
 a fashion show.                       
 A competition was launched in which   
 people were asked to submit their     
 ideas for the sign. Many children from
 the school entered the competition.   
 The final design was composed of parts
 of the winning designs which were     
 thought to represent life in Warboys. 
 The sign was made and painted by Mr.  
 Howard Carter of Swaffam, Norfolk.
