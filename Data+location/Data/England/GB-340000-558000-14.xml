		<title>14COMPUTERS IN THE COUNTRYSIDE</title>
		<content> There are very few industries in this 
 area other than actual farming,but it 
 is surprising to find that one of them
 is connected to the computer business.
  Dunglinson's is a firm which supplies
 and maintains business computer       
 systems to local farms and small      
 industries.They also deal in t.v and  
 video and started out as agricultural 
 engineers and suppliers.              
     They have 14 people working for   
 them full time and use two delivery   
 vehicles.Mr.Dunglinson told us that   
 more and more farmers are using       
 computers to help them with their     
 businesses and also to keep records of
 milk yields and feeding ststistics.   
     It was surprising to find         
 micro-computers and engineers right in
 the middle of the                     
 countryside,alongside a dairy farm and
 a long way from the town.             </content>
