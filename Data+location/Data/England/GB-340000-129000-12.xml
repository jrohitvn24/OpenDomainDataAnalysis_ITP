		<content> 100 households were asked where they  
 work. 35% work within the block. They 
 are employed in a variety of ways: on 
 the farms, in the 2 schools, computer 
 programming, smallhold farming. About 
 8 people carry on 'gloving' by        
 machines in their own homes. The      
 material, sometimes ready cut, is     
 brought to the homes from factories at
 Langport and Street, and is collected 
 on completion. 35% of the people      
 surveyed work within 10km of their    
 homes. 25% work in towns or cities up 
 to 50km away. Main places of work are 
 Street,Langport,Bridgwater,Taunton,   
 Yeovil. 5% have work which takes them 
 all over the world. 1 villager is a   
 timber expert who advises 3rd World   
 countries on tree growth and timber   
 marketing. Several of the farms are   
 self-sufficient. One smallholding     
 family barters milk for animal feed.  </content>
