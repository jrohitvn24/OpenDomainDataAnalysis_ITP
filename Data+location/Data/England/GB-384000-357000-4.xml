		<title>04Roepark Farm, Mow Cop</title>
		<content>  Our class walked from the Old Man    
of Mow (National Trust) along the      
Staffordshire Way, which follows the   
county border. In between this path and
the woods below, there are fields which
belong to Roepark Farm. We called at   
the farm and asked the farmer's wife,  
Mrs. Brookes about her farm.           
  It is a 62 acre farm and there are 80
beef cattle and a few sheep on it. The 
farmer has four dogs and two cats as   
well. Hay is the only crop grown and   
this is to feed the animals in winter. 
They fertilize the fields twice a year 
after cutting. To do many of the tasks 
such as baling, muckspreading and      
carrying, the farmer uses a tractor, an
International. The farm used to be run 
as a dairy farm and they still have    
some milking equipment.
