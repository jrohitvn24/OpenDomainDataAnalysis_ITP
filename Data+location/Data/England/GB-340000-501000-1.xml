		<title>01Troutbeck valley - General</title>
		<content> The survey area is dominated by the   
 valley of the Trout beck and the      
 village of the same name, running     
 north to south in the western half of 
 the area. The eastern half is an      
 upland area reaching 478m. in the     
 summit of Sour Howes. To the south,   
 the valley opens out as the land      
 descends towards Windermere. To the   
 north, the valley extends further in  
 to the higher and more rugged mass of 
 the central Lakeland fells.           
 Troutbeck is one of the most          
 attractive villages in the whole      
 region and is a tourist 'honey-pot'.  
 "Town End" is a 16th century house    
 owned by the National Trust and open  
 to the public. The popularity of the  
 village puts a lot of pressure on     
 house prices and local people are not 
 able to compete. The main Ullswater   
 road runs through the valley.         </content>
