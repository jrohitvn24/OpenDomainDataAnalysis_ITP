		<content> The farming in this area is almost    
 entirely dairy farming.  There is some
 stock rearing and potato growing.  The
 cereals that are grown are largely for
 the farmers' own use.  Large areas of 
 land are used for growing grass which 
 is turned into silage - 3 crops a year
 is not unusual, and to a lesser extent
 hay is harvested.  These are used for 
 winter fodder.  The grassland is      
 intensively cultivated using chemical 
 and natural fertilizers. Most farms   
 are highly mechanised and employ few  
 workers. Farms are often just big     
 enough to be managed by the family.   
 The milk produced on the farm is      
 stored in cooled containers and       
 collected daily by a bulk tanker to be
 taken to a large dairy supervised by  
 the Milk Marketing Board. Many farms  
 now have shops and sell potatoes, eggs
 and vegetables 'at the gate'.         </content>
