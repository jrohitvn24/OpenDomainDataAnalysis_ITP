		<title>16INDUSTRY INDUSTRIAL ESTATE</title>
		<content> On the{Ferndown Industrial Estate}the 
 majority of the 89 firms are heavy    
 industry but there are a few light    
 engineering firms and some warehouses.
 The products range from paper and     
 printing to brick making. Access to   
 the estate is by four roads and two   
 paths. The largest building belongs to
 Sherry and Haycock. It extends for    
 some distance behind numbers 19,20 and
 21. My Dad works for a wholesale      
 grocery firm. Much of the land is     
 still vacant and I think it is a good 
 place for{wild life,}because beside my
 Dad's depot we found a rabbit burrow, 
 and in the winter you can see little  
 footprints in the snow. I went with   
 some children in my class and our     
 teacher to talk to the Director of a  
 metal manufacturing works, where raw  
 metal is cast. He gave us a small     
 casting to take back to school.       </content>
