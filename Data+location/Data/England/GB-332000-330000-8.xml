		<title>08Employment Express Dairy</title>
		<content> The Express Dairy Whittington is an   
 important part of local employment    
 because 250 people work there all the 
 shifts.The Dairy does not produce its 
 own cheese although they add herbs and
 pack it.Large blocks of cheese are    
 delivered to the Dairy weighing about 
 40 pounds.Each block is worth Â£40 to  
 Â£60.These blocks are pushed through   
 cheese wires which cut them into      
 smaller blocks.Some of the cheese is  
 grated,herbs are added and then it is 
 pressed and packed.They are then kept 
 in a coldstore until they are         
 dispatched.Yoghurts and cheesecakes   
 are made by large and noisy           
 machines.Empty cartons are placed at  
 the back of the machine which turns   
 and adds the ingredients of biscuit   
 crumbs,fruit and whipped cream for the
 cheesecakes or fruit for the yoghurts.
