		<title>02THE MAYOR OF KNUTSFORD</title>
		<content>  The town was granted its first       
 Charter in 1292 by William de Tabley. 
 This provided for a borough Court for 
 Knutsford.  Burgesses were given power
 to elect a bailiff (Mayor) of         
 Knutsford and the first holder of the 
 office was John Hall in about 1300    
 a.d.                                  
  The Mayor is elected by his or her   
 fellow councillors and presides over  
 Knutsford for a period of 12 months.  
 When attending civic functions the    
 Mayor must wear a chain of office.  He
 or she can be re-elected any number of
 times.                                
  The Mayor attends council meetings   
 twice a month.  Every other year the  
 Mayor of Knutsford visits our twin    
 town, Montmorency in France to attend 
 their cherry festival.  Knutsford is  
 in the borough of Macclesfield.  The  
 present Mayor is Mrs. Barbara Phibbs. </content>
