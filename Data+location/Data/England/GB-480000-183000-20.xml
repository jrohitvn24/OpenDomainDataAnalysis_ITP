		<content>   Hurley's busy communal life is based
 mainly at the village hall.Pre-school 
 children go there 3 times a week.     
 School children go there for Brownies 
 &amp; Cubs.There is a Woman's Institute &amp; 
 a Preservation Society whose aim is to
 cherish their historical buildings.   
   There is also a Village Association 
 which is concerned with village       
 affairs generally.Its main event is   
 the annual Fete which raises money for
 repairing the village hall etc.All    
 other societies hold jumble sales,barn
 dances etc. to raise funds.           
   There are thriving cricket &amp; tennis 
 clubs.The tennis club encourages the  
 whole family to join in.During school 
 holidays activities are organised for 
 school age children.                  
   Some families don't participate in  
 village life particularly those whose 
 children go to boarding school.       </content>
