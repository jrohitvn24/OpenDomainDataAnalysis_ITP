		<content> Many local traditions survive from the
 past. The{Sowerby Bridge Morris}are   
 frequently seen performing traditional
 local dances at many events.          
                                       
 At the annual{Rushbearing}a decorated 
 cart, specially made by local         
 craftsmen, and accompanied by a local 
 band, carries a maiden and sheaves of 
 rushes in procession along the Ryburn 
 Valley to Saint Bartholomew's Church  
 in Ripponden. The cart is met by the  
 local clergy and prayers are said for 
 the harvest and crops to come.        
                                       
 Other traditions are more modern. In  
 Barkisland the local{drama group}     
 organises a{pantomime,}involving many 
 children and adults from the village. 
 Performances are given to packed      
 audiences for three days in February.
