 In December 1983 there were 2985      
 policemen in the Avon and Somerset    
 constabulary.In the Ilminster section 
 there are eleven policemen and one    
 sergeant.The Ilminster (West) beat is 
 ten square miles and 4100 people live 
 in it.                                
  The policemen may have to cover up   
 to thirty miles.In Broadway there are 
 about two burglaries a year,people    
 are very law  abiding.Our local       
 policeman deals with criminal         
 damage,theft and road accidents.      
  He has a car with a radio telephone  
 to go from village to village,and the 
 control room at Yeovil can talk to    
 him, but when he is out walking he    
 cannot be contacted.When you dial 999 
 your message goes to the Yeovil       
 control room which sends the nearest  
 policeman in a car.                   </content>
