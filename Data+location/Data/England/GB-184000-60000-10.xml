		<content> At{PORTH WATER WORKS}the water is     
 treated to make it drinkable.It comes 
 from the Porth River which was dammed 
 to create{PORTH RESERVOIR. Most of }  
 the water goes to the Newquay area and
 St.Mawgan.It is purified by adding    
 chemicals and by filtering through    
 four feet of sand.The water works     
 (built in 1925) cleans about 2 million
 gallons of water a day in the Summer  
 and 1 million gallons a day in the    
 winter. The site has always been      
 powered by electricity and when there 
 is a power cut there is a standby     
 diesel engine.This is importnat if    
 there is a coal strike for example,   
 when power is not available through   
 the {"NATIONAL ELECTRICITY GRID"}     
 There are five farms in our area one  
 of which is called "High Lanes",owned 
 by Mr Hicks who has been farming there
 all of his life.                      </content>
