		<title>02OUR FRIEND THE RECTOR</title>
		<content> Our Rector comes from Market Drayton  
 to Adderley church ST.Peters. He also 
 comes to our school. He tells us tales
 about his family and God. Sometimes he
 is funny he has a beard and glasses   
 and has a bald patch on his head.     
 He has a young family and he has only 
 just returned from Zimbabwe Africa. He
 is a friendly Rector and comes to see 
 people when they are lonely or upset. 
 When he has taken our assembly at     
 school every Tuesday he looks at our  
 work and asks us about it. He is also 
 the chairman of the school Governors  
 thats why he looks at our work. He's  
 been here for three years. He said    
 that more people come to church in the
 morning services. We like our Rector  
 and we hope he will stay.
