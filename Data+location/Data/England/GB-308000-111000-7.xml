 after lunch they would play in the    
 playground.Girls in the front         
 playground,boys in the back.One day a 
 girl fell off the wall which runs     
 around the playground and so they put 
 railings up which are still there.The 
 Vicar would come to talk to the       
 children some days but the best time  
 was in the Summer.Then they had their 
 sports' day.It was held in the field  
 and the vicar and his curate would    
 stand each side of the gate and throw 
 nuts for the children and two teachers
 would have great baskets and give each
 child a bun and an orange to go       
 home.During the two week Summer       
 holiday would be the Culmstock Flower 
 Show where there would be roundabouts 
 and horses that went up and down and  
 Mrs.Symons bought her first tomato for
 a penny but she thought it was a plum.</content>
