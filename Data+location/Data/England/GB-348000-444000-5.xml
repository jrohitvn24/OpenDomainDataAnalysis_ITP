		<title>05CANALS PAST AND PRESENT</title>
		<content>Canals are made using tens of thousands
of 'navvies'or 'cutters'using spades,  
picks,barrows,and horses.In the past   
canals were used to transport cargoes  
from one place to another.The main     
goods being coal,brick,wood,stone,grain
or passengers.                         
Horses were used to pull the boats at 2
m.p.h.The problems associtaed with the 
horses were that they needed rest and  
food at regular intervals.Later they   
were replaced by steam and eventually  
diesel engines.When James Brindley an  
 engineer planned a canal route he had 
 to uild over various obstructions.As a
result aqueducts were designed to carry
water over rivers,pathways,valleys,or  
roadways.The earliest aqueduct was     
built to carry the Bridgewater canal   
past the river Irwell at Barton.
