		<title>03Pendock School</title>
		<content>  Pendock School is over a 100 years   
 old and nearly every day we do        
 something different. In the Summer    
 every year we have an outing to an    
 intersting place. This year we went to
 Wookey Hole. Every year we go to the  
 Three Counties Show,but we never look 
 at the machinery.                     
             We have several TV        
 programmes every week. Every Christmas
 we do a Christmas play and Easter '84 
 we did Alice in Wonderland.  In the   
 Winter we went to London for three    
 days with the school, by train.The    
 train was a hour late coming but it   
 arrived at Paddington Station in      
 London on time. We have three play    
 times everday.We all enjoy life in a  
 Village School.
