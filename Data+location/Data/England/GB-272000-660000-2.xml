		<content>   In order to create this report a    
 number of citizens were interviewed   
 and their views recorded in three age 
 brackets.{                            
{1.CHILDREN                            
 Those in the children's age group     
 tend to be more activity minded than  
 the older generations, but they also  
 tend to watch live television more    
 frequently,often up to three or four  
 hours a night ;they also spend more   
 time than the others watching video   
 recordings.                           
   Many children play on their BMX     
 bicycles (a current fashion today     
 among the younger members of society).
 They also play computer games.Few     
 take part in an organised activity    
 outside the house such as             
 Scouting,golf,running or swimming.    
 They say a cinema is required in      
 this area.                            </content>
