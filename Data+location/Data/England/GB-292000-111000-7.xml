		<content> The people of Tiverton have a number  
 of ways of knowing what is going on   
 around them.  There is the local      
 newspaper called the "Tiverton        
 Gazette".  This comes out every       
 Tuesday and contains all sorts of     
 stories about town and country life.  
 There is also a free newspaper called 
 the "Mid Devon Star" which has lots of
 advertising as well as news.  It is   
 delivered to every home in Tiverton.  
 Sometimes events are advertised by    
 displays in the window of the "Western
 Counties Building Society".  Sometimes
 people can even arrange for a banner  
 to be stretched out across the main   
 road near the Town Hall.  Of course we
 also hear Devon's news on "BBC Radio  
 Devon" and "Devonair" as well as      
 watching television.  Most important  
 news is still passed on mainly by     
 talking to our friends.               </content>
