		<content> Hudnall Common near Gt Gaddesden has  
 its ECOLOGY closely monitored by local
 conservationists and the Herts Schools
 Field Centre at Hudnall Park, run by  
 Mr John Leonhardt.The Common was once 
 a grazing place for sheep, it is now  
 SHRUBLAND. Until 30 years ago there   
 was a large number of rabbits but an  
 outbreak of Myxamatosis killed many of
 them.Muntjac &amp; Fallow deer inhabit the
 Common today.Clustered Bell FLOWERS,  
 which are rare, are seen near the     
 roadside. The NATIONAL TRUST owns the 
 Common and it is illegal to uproot any
 of the flowers.
