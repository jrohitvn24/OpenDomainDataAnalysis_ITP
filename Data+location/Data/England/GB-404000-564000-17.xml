		<title>17EMPLOYMENT</title>
		<content> Much of the {employment }in this area 
 is on the land,there is one {garage}  
 and a {dress shop}both employing one  
 person each,the {Hunday Farm and      
{Tractor Museum}also employs local     
 people.{Mowden Hall School }is the    
 major employer but most of the        
 teaching staff come from outside the  
 area.The domestic side however,as at  
{Stelling Hall }is looked after by     
 local people.Because the area is      
 sparsely populated unemployment is not
 the problem it is in a city.Those     
 seeking employment outside the area   
 would need their own transport as only
 a very poor bus service exists,with   
 bus stops quite a long walk away from 
 the houses and farms.A special coach  
 takes children from the farms to      
 schools outside the area,but this     
 means that out of school activities   
 may be curtailed,unless parents help. </content>
