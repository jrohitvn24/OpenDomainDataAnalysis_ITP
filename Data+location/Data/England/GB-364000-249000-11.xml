		<content> This is predominantly a farming area  
 and many people who do not actually   
 own or rent a farm are employed by the
 local farmers,though the increased    
 use of tractors and other machinery   
 means that fewer people are employed, 
 even during the harvest and           
 hop-picking seasons. Although this was
 once a  thriving hop growing area,    
 only three farms grow them now. Most  
 farms grow apples which are sold to   
 well known Herefordshire cider makers,
 while three farms specialise in  soft 
 fruit - blackcurrants, raspberries,   
 and strawberries.  One farmer grows   
 daffodils commercially.
