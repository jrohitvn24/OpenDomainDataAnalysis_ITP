		<title>11THE BRENDON HILLS IRON MINES</title>
		<content> To the north of this area are the     
 remains of the iron mining industry   
 that flourished in the Brendon Hill   
 during the nineteenth century. This   
 reached a peak in 1877 when over      
 52,000 tons of iron ore was taken by  
 the now abandoned railway to the      
 incline near Brendon Hill from where  
 it was shipped to Ebbw Vale.          
 About 100 of the miners lived in the  
 hamlet of Gupworthy, now only a few   
 cottages. Nonconformity and temperance
 alike flourished on the Brendons and  
 there was a temperance hotel and      
 Gupworthy had its own temperance      
 society. After the Spanish Civil war  
 the area declined and the railway was 
 closed in 1898.                       
 It was reopened for two years in 1907 
 but was finally lifted during the     
 First World War and used for scrap    
 steel. (See Ralegh's Cross).          </content>
