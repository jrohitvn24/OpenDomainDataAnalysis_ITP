		<content> The house,The Gables,was built in     
 1884,100 years later Mr.Murray,       
 Mr.Turner and Mr.Taylor bought the    
 house &amp; opened a branch practice.It   
 was intended to serve pet owners of   
 Worcester.Large numbers of dogs &amp;     
 cats are brought from Worcester &amp;     
 surrounding villages.Later in 1938 a  
 2nd branch was opened in Ledbury,&amp; a  
 3rd branch in Malvern in 1951.        
 The main treatments involve           
 vaccinations,speying &amp; accident       
 victims,eg being run over by a car or 
 farm machine accidents.The worst      
 injury for a cat is to get its        
 intestines mixed up with its lungs.The
 simplest injury is being bitten by    
 another cat.The worst injury for a dog
 is for its stomach to inflate &amp; twist.
 Between 40 &amp; 90 pets a day come to the
 surgery.The Worcester branch employs 2
 surgeons &amp; 4 nurses.                  </content>
