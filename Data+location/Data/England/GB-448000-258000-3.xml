		<title>03Where people shopped.</title>
		<content>We asked people in our block where they
shopped.(Most of them lived in         
Hellidon.)This is what we found:       
For Immediate or Urgent Food Shopping: 
Staverton village(3 miles away)and 6   
miles away,the small town of Daventry. 
For Planned or Mid-term Shopping:      
1st Daventry(mainly for Supermarket and
chemist).2nd:Coventry(20 miles         
away).3rd:Leamington(18 miles),4th:    
Banbury(16 miles).                     
For Luxury Shopping:1st Milton Keynes  
(18 miles).2nd Leamington.3rd:Banbury, 
4th Northampton(19 miles) and          
5th,London(85 miles).                  
With the exception of two people who   
used bicycles,all shoppers went by car.
As you can see, many people were       
prepared to travel quite long distances
to shop.Daventry was not more widely   
used because of'lack of choiceÂ£.
