		<title>10Local History in Oakley</title>
		<content>Oakley was once part of the Bernwode   
Forest. Oakley derived its name from   
the Saxon words Aclin or Achlaie which 
meant oak trees and a plain.           
The school was built in the 18th       
Century,and would have been a lace     
school.In 1859 a brick and stone school
was built,there was a house for the    
teacher adjoining, which was later     
struck by lightning. No one was hurt.  
The school was enlarged in 1884. It    
closed in 1959 when a new school was   
built.                                 
Deliveries in the village used to be   
by pony and cart. The Worminghall Road 
was known as "Uptown". There was a     
sweet shop in Mill House.              
Roman pottery and coins have been      
found at Ixhill Farm which is thought  
to have been a Roman Villa.
