		<title>01THE VILLAGE OF WHITEGATE</title>
		<content> The village of Whitegate is a         
 predominantly rural area.  The main   
 occupation seems to be farming and    
 there is also a little industry.  The 
 industries tend to be related to      
 agriculture.  The quarrying removes   
 the sand from the land and so makes it
 able to keep the moisture.  This makes
 the land better for farming, because  
 the grass does not dry up and is      
 better for the cows.  The meat        
 processing centre at Hartford obtains 
 its meat from beef farms.             
 The main place of historical interest 
 is Vale Royal Abbey.  At the entrance 
 to the Abbey there was once a white   
 gate and this is how the village got  
 its name.                             
 The leisure facility is mainly the    
 golf club and Pettypool.  Whitegate   
 has been conserved with care and is   
 full of interesting things to see.    </content>
