		<content> Near Adversane is an 8-acre industrial
 site used by Vehicle and Car Breakers.
 This is well screened from the road   
 and neighbours by coppices and banked 
 grassland, and a long winding approach
 road so discreetly signposted that few
 people know of the firm's existence.  
 Car bodies from 50 years ago lie      
 buried deep under trees and bushes.   
 Not far away on the Billingshurst road
 lie two large agricultural buildings  
 used for wholesaling pesticides. This 
 land is on clay; the remainder of the 
 7-acre site is on Greensand, and is   
 used as a nursery, with glasshouses.  
     A small agricultural manufacturing
 concern off the Coolham road processes
 crops such as oilseed rape, peas and  
 all beans to make animal feeds (mostly
 pellets and nuts) for farm livestock. 
 They first used beans in 1985.        
 Near Coneyhurst is a boarding kennels.</content>
