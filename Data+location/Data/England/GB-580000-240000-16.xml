		<title>16People On Village Life.</title>
		<content>   In Belchamp walter people feel the  
 character of the village has changed a
 lot-due to declining population. Many 
 cottages are occupied by 'weekenders' 
 who contribute nothing to the         
 community. There are very few families
 with young children in the village,   
 the school has closed and there is no 
 playgroup. There are very few         
 opportunities for people from         
 different walks of life to meet, so   
 community life suffers. In Belchamp   
 Otten however attitudes are different 
 because there are few 'weekenders',   
 most families are middle aged and     
 there are more young children.        
 Belchamp otten is also much nearer to 
 Belchamp St Pauls with a good         
 connecting footpath so they join in   
 more things in St Pauls.              
   There is a goodwill feeling towards 
 the church though many don't attend.  </content>
