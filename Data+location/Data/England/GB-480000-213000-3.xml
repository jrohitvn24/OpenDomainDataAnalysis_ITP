		<title>03RELIGION IN AYLESBURY</title>
		<content>The religious life of Aylesbury is     
represented by many Christian          
denominations and a {Moslem            
mosque}.Other religions such as        
{Hinduism,Judaism and Sikhism} have    
members but no formal place of         
worship.  The Roman Catholic church    
accounts for about one third of        
Christians in Aylesbury from           
several nationalities.The Anglican     
church of {St. Mary's} has a           
congregation of about 150 and an       
active {community centre}.The          
Methodist church has about 200         
members.All the churches are involved  
in a wide range of week night          
activities and fund raising projects - 
community work is strong.The community 
centre of St. Mary's involves people   
from all sections of the               
community,both Christians and          
non-Christians.                        </content>
