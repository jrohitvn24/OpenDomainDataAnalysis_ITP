		<content>  All the buildings in this area are   
 stone-built, the only exception being 
 the front of Green Farm, which is     
 brick. The older buildings are        
 sandstone, the new ones reconstituted 
 stone.                                
  Half the houses in the village are   
 over one hundred years old and a      
 quarter of them are more than two     
 hundred years old. Of the other half, 
 the majority of them have been built  
 since the second world war. Many of   
 the older houses have been modernised 
 in recent years also.                 
  Some of the new dwellings are        
 bungalows, but there are still many   
 more houses than bungalows.           
  Houses are quite expensive to buy in 
 this village. They might cost between 
 forty thousand and one hundred        
 thousand pounds at the moment,        
 depending upon size and position.     </content>
