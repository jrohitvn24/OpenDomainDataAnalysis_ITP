  A number of courses and clubs are run
for adults, although many activities   
also take place in the nearby towns of 
Newcastle, Stoke, Hanley and Crewe.    
  For the ladies, cake decorating and  
flower arranging classes meet regularly
and many adults take part in Yoga and  
Keep Fit sessions. There is a Badminton
club at Madeley Comprehensive School,  
and fishing at Madeley Pool.           
  Although no restaurants are provided 
in Madeley, there are two pubs and one 
Working Men's Club providing evening   
entertainmen.Besides the usual sporting
activities such as jogging, walking and
cycling there are more unusual pursuits
such as pigeon flying, ornamental fish-
keeping, home brewing (beer and wine)  
and sword collecting. There is a Natio-
nal Houswives Register, a Mothers Union
and a Women's Institute.               </content>
