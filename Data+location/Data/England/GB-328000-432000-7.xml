		<title>07GAMES WE PLAY - SALLY</title>
		<content> The games I play are Cluedo, Ker-plunk
 and Monopoly.  They are my best games.
  I also play Guess-who.  I have some  
 pieces missing on Guess-who.  I like  
 playing netball and being             
 Goal-Shooter so I can shoot.  I like  
 playing hide and seek and Polo, they  
 are good games.  My favourite games   
 are Monopoly and Cluedo.  I play      
 these games all the time.  Mostly at  
 night, I play Cluedo and Monopoly.    
 The game Ker-plunk is where you put   
 the straws in the holes and then you  
 put the marbles in.  And the game     
 Cluedo is where you have to cross out 
 on a piece of paper.  Cluedo is easy  
 when you know how.  Monopoly is an    
 easy game it is similar to Cluedo.    
 Monopoly you have to go round the     
 board.  I play Guess-who with my      
 brother.I nearly win all the time-my  
 brother is no good.                   </content>
