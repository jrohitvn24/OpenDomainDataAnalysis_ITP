		<content> It is quite easy to get a job because 
 there is a Job Centre in Bovey Tracey.
 However there are not enough jobs to  
 go around.  One boy in our class said 
 his Dad does not have a job so  he's  
 not very rich. Most people in Bovey   
 Tracey have a job,working in shops    
 cafe's, health centres, factories and 
 other thing's like that. I think most 
 people like their job's. Some people  
 go to Exeter, Newton Abbot, Torquay   
 and even Plymouth to work. Hawkmoor   
 Hospital, Bovey Tracey Hospital,      
 farms, and local businesses all       
 provide employment.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
