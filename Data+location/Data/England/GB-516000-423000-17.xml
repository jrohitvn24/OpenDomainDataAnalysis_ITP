		<content>  There are not many people living in  
 our area.There are three farms, two   
 small holdings two private dwellings  
 and a large manor house.              
  In the whole of the area there are   
 only twenty eight people.Most of the  
 people live in the area because they  
 work on the land or are connected with
 the land.                             
  Out of these people there are only   
 two children who are of school age and
 two children who are younger than     
 school age. All the rest of the       
 population are older and most of them 
 have lived in the area for a very long
 time.                                 
   At the three farms the families have
 been there a long time and can        
 remember their grandfathers living    
 there before them.Only one family has 
 moved here from another area of the   
 country.                              </content>
