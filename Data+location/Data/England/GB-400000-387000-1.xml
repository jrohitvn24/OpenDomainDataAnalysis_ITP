		<content>  Many years ago on Broadhurst Edge    
 farm there was a man called Mr.       
 Brocklehurst.At that time the farm was
 very big because he used to have      
 cattle and he held auctions at the    
 front of the house. Later on the farm 
 was sold with a small plot of land so 
 we only have 25 acres now.In May 1978 
 we opened the kennels. In the dog     
 house we have eleven kennels and      
 twelve cat pens.In 1980 we moved the  
 cats into the stables and made the    
 cattery there.We now have  a small    
 dogs kennels with thirteen more       
 kennels.We open from 9.00a.m.         
 until 12.00 and 4.00p.m. until        
 6.00p.m.We take all kinds of dogs and 
 cats.                                 
     My mum feeds the animals every    
 afternoon at 5.00p.m.She gives them   
 vitamins and meat.Dogs that are fussy 
 usually have meat and biscuits.       </content>
