 There are two places of worship in the
centre of Hundon.                      
                                       
"All Saints" Parish Church.            
The present umcumbant is Father Jeremy 
Cooper.                                
The Church is thought to have been     
built circa 1516. The structure is a   
fine building which stood back from the
main street of the village, on the     
side of the hill.  It is an ancient    
structure of flint, mostly in the      
perpendicular style , consisting of    
chancel, nave, chapel aisles,south     
porch, with a very fine embattled      
western tower, containing a clock and  
six bells. A new organ was provided in 
1897, and the church partially         
re-stored and re-seated with open oak  
benches in 1886. Records dated back to 
th 15th or 16th Century.               </content>
