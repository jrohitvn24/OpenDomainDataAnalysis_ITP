		<title>14Architecture in Sth Benfleet</title>
		<content> South Benfleet can boast one house in 
 pure Modern Movement style built in   
 1937 to the design of the well known  
 architect Wells Coates. It is said to 
 be modelled on Le Corbusier's Villa   
 Savoye and is now listed.The Modern   
 Movement influenced design in the     
 post_war period mostly in public      
 buildings,such as Appleton and Kents  
 Hill Schools and some large Shopping  
 Arcades along the High Road.A few     
 private houses can be seen in Kents   
 Hill Road,but the troublesome flat    
 roofs are not popular.The Sixth Form  
 College and adjacent Council Offices  
 also echo Bauhaus_Expressionist idea  
 of a crowning crystalline roof.The    
 once flat_roofed rectangular Runnymede
 Civic Hall was enclosed in a          
 steelframe last year and has now the  
 appearance of a huge Saxon Hall.
