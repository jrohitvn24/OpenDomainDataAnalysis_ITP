		<content>   We wanted to know what{clothes      
 children of our age like to wear, so  
 we organised a survey.  We questioned 
 all the{Second Year children}in our   
{Middle School.} Most girls prefer a   
{full shoe.  Ear-rings}are the most    
 popular piece of{jewellery.} Most     
 girls do not like to colour their     
 hair and prefer{long hair. }Many of   
 the girls like{short skirts.} Only one
 girl does not wear makeup at some     
 time. {Knee-length and ankle-length   
{socks}are preferred to any other leg- 
 wear.                                 
    When we spoke to the boys we found 
 that they prefer{trainers}to any other
 shoes.  They do not really wear any   
 jewellery except{watches. }Nearly all 
 the boys like to wear{jeans}and       
{fashionable clothes.} Most boys prefer
{short hair. }The boys seem to like    
 girls wearing trousers.               </content>
