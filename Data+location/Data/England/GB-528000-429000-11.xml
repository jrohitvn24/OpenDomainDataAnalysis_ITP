		<content> When the Roman occupation came to an  
 end,about 420 A.D.,Scandinavian       
 settlers first invaded,then colonized 
 Holderness.Much later the Danes came  
 and all eastern England became part of
 the "Danelaw".It is impossible to say 
 when the first settlement appeared in 
 Roos.In the Domesday Book,Roos had    
 thirty acres of meadow,plough land, a 
 church and a priest.William gave the  
 land here to Drogo de Brevere who     
 installed a vassal of his,called Fulco
 to oversee the land.After Drogo had   
 killed his wife,William's niece, he   
 fled the country and the land came    
 into the hands of Odo,Count of        
 Champagne.Odo plotted against William 
 Rufus and left on a crusade.The       
 village then passed to the Counts of  
 Aumale.The village has changed little 
 in character since Medieval times.
