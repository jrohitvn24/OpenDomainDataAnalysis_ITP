		<title>05Guides at Wroxton Abbey.</title>
		<content> On Saturday evening June 29th 1985 the
Guides from the Banbury District went  
to a singalong for Guides, Brownies and
their friends. This was to end the week
of celebration for the Guides 75th     
Anniversary. The event was held in the 
grounds of Wroxton Abbey, which is now 
part of the Fairligh Dickinson         
University of New Jersey U.S.A.        
Admission was by ticket and on arrival 
people were given a programme. Everyone
found a space on the grass to sit and  
at 7.00pm the singing started. The     
songs sung included Tzena, Theres a    
hole in my bucket, and Mouse in a      
windmill. At 8.00pm there was break and
people were able to get something to   
eat. The singing restarted at 8.30pm.  
and continued until about 9.00pm., when
everybody returned home.
