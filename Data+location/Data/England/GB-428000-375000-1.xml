		<title>01HOLMESFIELD'S RURAL AREA</title>
		<content> Our area is beautiful,tranquil and    
 unspoilt. Isolated farming hamlets lie
 in hilly surroundings connected by    
 winding,narrow roads which are often  
 precarious in winter.The Northern     
 fringe of the area consists of        
 stretches of bleak moorland dropping  
 into a pastoral valley.               
 Large{Tudor halls}with{cruck barns    
 are a feature of the area.The district
 is served by Penny Acres Primary      
 School and Holmesfield Parish Church, 
 St.Swithins.There is also a farm shop.
{ Mixed farming},mainly dairy,is found 
 in the valleys.Wood plantations and   
 moorland sheep are to be found on the 
 hills.Included in our area is a{fox   
{hunt},kennels and a{reservoir}.       
{Cordwell valley}is one of the most    
 beautiful English valleys at          
 rhododendron time .
