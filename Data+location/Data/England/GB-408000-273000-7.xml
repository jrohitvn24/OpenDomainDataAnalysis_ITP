		<content> There are several dairy farms in the  
 area which produce milk which is      
 collected and transported to Quinneys 
 in Redditch.                          
  {Fowler's Dairy}has been established 
 in the Midlands for many years and the
 present farmhouse was built in 1914.It
 is the only dairy producing cheese and
 butter within a radius of 88 miles.   
 The present Mr. Fowler is of the fifth
 generation of the Fowler family.He    
 owns a 100 cows and 1 Hereford bull.  
 The cows are milked twice daily and   
 produce an average of 1300 gallons per
 year for 1 cow. Most of the milk is   
 used for cheese, the rest for butter. 
 One gallon of milk makes one pound of 
 cheese. Cheddar and Chesire cheese are
 produced and sold in many of the local
 shops in area.
