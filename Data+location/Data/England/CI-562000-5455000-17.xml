		<title>17Black Butter Making, St.John</title>
		<content> Black Butter, a kind of preserve, is  
 made mainly with apples. The          
{ingredients}are{cider apples, sugar,  
 and{liquorice.}Other{spices}are added 
 to individual preference.             
                                       
 Black Butter was very popular in years
 gone by, but is made nowadays as a    
 rare{social occasion.                 
                                       
 Black Butter is made near apple       
 harvest time by peeling and cutting up
 many apples, and placing them in a    
{"bachin",}(a large brass bowl)        
 containing the boiling cider to be    
 cooked. This mixture is stirred for at
 least twenty-four hours and then put  
 into jars.                            
                                       
 When I tried Black Butter, I did not  
 like it though many folk do.
