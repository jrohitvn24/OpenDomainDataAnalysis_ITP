		<title>17ALLESLEY PARK ESTATE</title>
		<content>{I like Allesley Park Estate}because   
 there are convenient shops which sell 
 all sorts of things. There is a park  
 with swings, a slide, a roundabout, a 
 seesaw and a climbing frame. Our      
 school sometimes has sponsored walks  
 round the park; the money we raise    
 goes towards paying for school        
 equipment.                            
                                       
 Just up the road there is a community 
 centre where there is a youth club;   
 brownies and guides are held there    
 too, whilst car boot sales and dancing
 lessons have started there recently.  
 There are also quite good bus services
 and the roads are fairly quiet.       
                                       
 At night if you stand on top of the   
 hill you can see the city all lit up  
 and it looks like a model village.
