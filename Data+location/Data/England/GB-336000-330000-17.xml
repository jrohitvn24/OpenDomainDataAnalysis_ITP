		<title>17Where people go for services</title>
		<content>  With the exception of Tetchill's Post
 Office, the only  services in our area
 are telephone boxes  and  post  boxes.
 Thus it is clear that  people  have to
 go further afield.Upper Frankton has a
 number of  basic  services  such  as a
 garage, a  general  store  and  a post
 office to which  the  locals  can  go.
 Recently  a  'pub', "The Narrowboat"  
 has opened by the canal at Frankton. A
 surprisingly large range  of  services
 are available in  Ellesmere  and  many
 farmers still go there on Fridays. The
 most popular stock  market is Oswestry
 and  it  is  also a  popular  shopping
 centre. If  people  are  in  search of
 entertainment they often go to pubs in
 Ellesmere or to the Old Comrades  Club
 while, slightly  nearer, the Ellesmere
 College  Arts  Centre  provides  films
 and live entertainment. The  college's
 squash facilities are also popular.   </content>
