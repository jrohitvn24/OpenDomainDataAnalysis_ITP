 survey area.There are 'Women's        
 Cricket', 'Women's Rounders',Brownies 
 and W.I. (W.I.stands for Womens       
 Institute).                           
 The Brownies and the W.I. meet in     
 the village hall.There is the local   
 sports club that looks after the      
 sports field,providing facilities     
 for football,rounders,tennis and      
 cricket.A bowling green is being      
 prepared this year also,as is a       
 children's playing area.The village   
 sports teams regulary play            
 'friendlies' against other local      
 village teams,and the sports field is 
 also used by other village teams who  
 do not have a playing field.
