{Travis Teversham,}Sawston's local     
 historian was born in 1882 and        
 educated at Sawston Infant School     
 later going to Cambridge University   
 where he obtained a Diploma in        
 Agriculture. He taught in various     
 schools and fought in the Army in the 
 1914-18 War. He recovered from        
 tuberculosis in 1928 and became a     
 guide at Sawston Hall. Still weak and 
 unable to work, he studied nature and 
 also wrote the History of Sawston in  
 two volumes published in 1942 and     
 1947. His favourite pastimes were     
 cricket, golf and listening to music. 
 He died at the old age of 88 on May 2 
 1971.
