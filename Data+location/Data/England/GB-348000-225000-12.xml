      The season starts with pruning,  
 which takes one person 3 months.  By  
 April spraying  for pest control      
 (aphids,red spider, mite, Tortrix,    
 etc.) and fungicides for mildew, scab 
 etc. are applied at l0 day intervals  
 until early August.  Sprays are       
 becoming safer and more selective in  
 control but pests still become        
 resistant relatively quickly.         
 Calcium and boron are also sprayed on 
 the trees to counteract deficiency in 
 the  light Ross sandstone soils.  The 
 trees are on  rootstock M.M.9 and     
 having shallow roots are susceptible  
 to leaching.                          
   The rootstock limits tree size to 6 
 ft. so no ladderwork is necessary, but
 the tree needs staking all its life.  
 Other sprays prolong harvesting.
