		<content>    Hensby Composts was founded in     
 1964.It sells two different types of  
 compost.One is phase 1 compost,which  
 is tested for quality then sold to    
  customers,and the other is phase 2   
 compost which contains mushroom       
 spawn.                                
    To make compost horse manure,      
 chicken manure and straw are mixed    
 together.The compost is left in long  
 rows and is regularly turned to       
 encourage fermentation.Once the       
 process is complete the compost is    
 formed into blocks and mushroom       
 spawns are added.The machine wraps    
 polythene around each block and it    
 is stored until delivery to customers.
