		<content> Timbercliffe is a housing estate which
 was built by Fothergill and Harvey    
 for their  workers.They were built    
 from the ash from the boilers.Now they
 are not owned by Fothergill &amp; Harvey  
 but are private.                      
     There is a council estate,Barnes  
 Meadows and the houses are being      
 rebuilt because the concrete frames on
 the houses were cracking.People had to
 be rehoused and many children in our  
 school were affected.                 
     Summit is Victorian and Edwardian 
 ribbon development.They are stone     
 houses and cottages made from local   
 stone.There are quite a lot of old    
 settlements such as Salley Street.They
 were built in the 17-18th century and 
 were handloom weavers cottages.There  
 are also quite a lot of farm settle-  
 ments some have been converted into   
 dwellings but some are still farms.   </content>
