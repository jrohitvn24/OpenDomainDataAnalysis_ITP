		<content>}Oakham is the market town of Rutland, 
 which is now part of Leicestershire.  
{Rutland Water}lies at the heart of the
 district - a reservior the size of    
 Lake Windermere. Oakham is 3 miles    
 from the water and all its leisure    
 facilities, while at the same time    
 being ideally linked to major cities  
 such as Leicester and Peterborough.   
 Oakham has a population of 8,000      
 Some work in local industry, while    
 others commute to near-by cities. The 
 District Council Offices and Oakham   
 School (an independent school) employ 
 many more. There are 5 Primary        
 Schools, a Middle School and a 6th    
 Form College as well as a small       
 hospital and other essential services.
 Oakham and its surrounding area has   
 much to offer everybody.
