		<content> I got up late this morning because I  
 had watched{Miami Vice,}the latest    
 detective serial, until late last     
 night. I got dressed hurriedly        
 worrying that I might be late for     
 school and not having had any         
 breakfast, my stomach was rumbling    
 like a frightened dog. I grabbed my   
 bag and ran to school, dashed to      
 registration for the sausage-string of
 names. I dawdled to lesson one, R.E.  
 which was followed by a succession of 
 lessons:gym, maths, French, English,  
 General Science. The hours ticked by  
 until 3.40p.m. which was{Hometime:}   
 bliss! A time when I can go out with  
 my friends. After I have spent an     
 enjoyable evening with them, it's time
 for bed with a quick ten minutes of   
 homework first!
