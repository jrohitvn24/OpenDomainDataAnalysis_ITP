		<title>08MARKET DAY, BOURNE</title>
		<content>   On Thursdays and Saturdays there are
 many more shoppers in the town centre 
 because of the street market.People   
 come from further afield to the market
 and this brings customers into other  
 shops in the town centre.             
   The market stalls are convenient    
 because often the goods are cheaper   
 and they are also near the other shops
 but they are unpopular with some      
 people because they block up the road 
 for traffic when people are trying to 
 travel to work. You often cannot park 
 your car near the shops if you need to
 stop and buy something.               
   People who like to shop on Market   
 Days buy their food and clothes in the
 town.Otherwise, most people in Bourne 
 go to the Rainbow Supermarket.Good    
 quality clothes and shoes can be      
 bought in town but for more choice    
 people prefer to go to Peterborough.  </content>
