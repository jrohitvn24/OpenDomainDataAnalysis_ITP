		<title>09FARMING IN THE HOLME VALLEY</title>
		<content>     The farming in the Holme Valley   
 has been very much determined by its  
 reief and{climate.}Valley slopes do   
 not lend themselves to ploughing and  
 cultivation. An annual precipitation  
 of around 900mm for Huddersfield (more
 for the head of the valley and the    
 surrounding moors) &amp; mean temperature 
 ranges of 3 to 16 degrees celcius also
 severely restrict arable farming.     
   However, the West Yorks. conurbation
 to the north provided a ready local   
 market for milk and{dairy farming}    
 therefore developed in the valley.    
   On the moors the rough grazing,     
 unsuitable for cattle, was used for   
{sheep.}The breeds are those kept for  
 their{wool}and this, together with    
 other geographical factors, led to the
 growth of the important local wool    
 textile industry (see page 11).
