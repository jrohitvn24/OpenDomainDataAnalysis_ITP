		<title>12ASHDON GOLDSTONES FARM</title>
		<content>{Goldstones}farm,one of the oldest and 
 the second largest farm in our area,is
 farmed by Mr.Robert Furze.He owns 640 
 acres and rents another 90 acres.This 
 farm is typical of other farms in     
 Ashdon except that few other farms    
 have livestock. This year Mr.Furze is 
 growing 240 acres of wheat,300 acres  
 of barley and 100 acres of sugar beet.
 Copses take up 14 acres and the rest  
 is rough grazing land.Mr.Furze does   
 not grow rape but grows sugar beet    
 instead for he has not the equipment  
 for drying the rape.He does not grow  
 potatoes because he can only manage   
 the one root crop and prefers sugar   
 beet.To grow these crops the farmer   
 uses 160 tonnes artificial fertiliser 
 each year and is lucky to be able to  
 use the pig manure on his fields.The  
 soil at Goldstones is very fertile    
 and the farmer gets a high yield.     </content>
