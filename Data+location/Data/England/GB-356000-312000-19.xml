		<content> THE BUS SERVICE IS THE ONLY MEANS OF  
 PUBLIC TRANSPORT THERE IS FOR         
 RODINGTON AND WITHINGTON. THE TWO     
 NEAREST SHOPPING CENTRES ARE          
 WELLINGTON AND SHREWSBURY. THERE IS A 
 BUS TO SHREWSBURY ON WEDNESDAY MORNING
 RETURNING AFTER NOON. IT THEN RETURNS 
 TO SHREWSBURY BUT ANY PASSENGERS HAVE 
 TO ARRANGE THEIR OWN RETURN TRANSPORT.
 THE NEXT SERVICE TO SHREWSBURY IS ON  
 SATURDAY, WHEN THERE IS A BUS BOTH    
 MORNING AND AFTERNOON.  THE BUS TO    
 WELLINGTON IS ON A THURSDAY, WHICH IS 
 MARKET DAY. THIS IS A MORNING SERVICE 
 AND ANY PASSENGERS HAVE TO MAKE THEIR 
 OWN WAY HOME IF THEY RETURN IN THE    
 AFTERNOON.  THE JOURNEY TAKES AN HOUR,
 STOPPING AT ALL THE PICK UP POINTS.THE
 BUS IS RARELY FILLED. MOST PEOPLE     
 REGARD THIS AS AN ADEQUATE SERVICE.   
 WHEN YOU LIVE IN THE COUNTRY YOU      
 EXPECT TO PROVIDE YOUR OWN TRANSPORT. </content>
