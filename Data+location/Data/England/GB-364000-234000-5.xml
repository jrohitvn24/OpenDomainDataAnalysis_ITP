		<content>{Apples                                
 There are extensive orchards producing
 eating &amp; cooking apples.   There is no
 "pick your own".                      
 One fruit farm specialises in quality 
 apples, some for export.   Orchards   
 are protected from wind by high       
 hedges.   Dwarfing rootstock is used  
 to keep trees small.   Fruit is       
 thinned by hand early in the season to
 enhance quality.   Apples are hand    
 picked.   Varieties include Crispin &amp; 
 Spartan for eating or cooking,        
 Jonogold an excellent eater, Discovery
 an early eater, some russets, the     
 popular Cox's Orange Pippin for       
 keeping &amp; eating &amp; Bramley's Seedling 
 a long keeping cooker.   Specialised  
 packaging is used.   Some casual      
 workers are employed seasonally.
