 The Worcestershire{Hunt,}for which the
 Squire of Bentley was best known,     
 (they were a hunting family) takes    
 place from October to March. One of   
 the{farm labourers}from Upper Bentley 
 Farm is the earth _ stopper,          
 preventing the fox from returning to  
 his den. People involved in the Hunt  
 are the Master and the hunters. There 
 are 16 to 18 couples of hounds and 50 
 to 100 horses. Although the Hunt was  
 originally intended for the local     
 farmers, it is now mainly supported by
 local{business men,}who can afford the
 time for this{recreation.
