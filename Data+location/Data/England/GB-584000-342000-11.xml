		<title>11HOLKAM HALL WILD ANIMALS</title>
		<content> There are a variety of wild animals at
 Holkham Hall.  There are deer that are
 very popular with the tourists.  There
 are about 550 does and 250 bucks.     
 There are 700 deer permanently on the 
 park.  In October, November and       
 December 200 deer are killed and sent 
 to the local butcher.  The does mate  
 in late Autumn though at this time    
 many of the young bucks are wounded by
 older and stronger bucks in fights    
 over the does.  It is very likely that
 an old buck may be defeated by a young
 buck.  After the mating season the doe
 will look for a suitable tree where   
 there are a lot of nettles where she  
 can give birth.  A doe can give birth 
 as early as January though March or   
 April is more usual.  During that time
 all the nettles around the trees are  
 left alone by the farmers so that the 
 doe is not disturbed.                 </content>
