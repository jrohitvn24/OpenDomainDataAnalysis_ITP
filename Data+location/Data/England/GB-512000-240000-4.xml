		<title>04INSIDE THE LOWER SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Southill Lower School is very small   
 with 47 children but there is only a  
 slight possibility of it closing      
 down.The headmistress and the children
 didn't want to see the school enlarged
 or changed in any way, but they would 
 like more children and teachers.At the
 school there is an outdoor swimming   
 pool,which is only used when the      
 weather is nice.The teachers can go in
 but that was a matter of              
 preference.The children start lessons 
 at 9.00 a.m,have a break at 10.25 a.m 
 and have lessons up to a lunchtime    
 break at 12.25 p.m.25 children eat    
 sandwiches, the rest eat school meals.
 Then they have more lessons until an  
 afternoon break and go home at 3.30 by
 bus.The children come from the        
 villages of Broom,Chicksands,Ireland  
 Southill and Stanford.
