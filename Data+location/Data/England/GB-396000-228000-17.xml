		<content> St. Martin De Tours Church,Woolstone  
 was partly rebuilt in 1499, but there 
 is no record of when it was first     
 built.It was further reconstructed in 
 1873.The present building is mainly   
 perpendicular. There is now only a    
 Tower,Nave and Chancel.The Tower has a
 marked lean to the West and South.It  
 holds a peal of six bells.There is an 
 interesting life-size effigy of a     
 priest on the floor, along the North  
 wall.The church is used every day for 
 worship.                              
 The Free Church was built in 1883 and 
 is still going strong with services   
 and Bible classes every week.It       
 occupies a building in the centre of  
 Gotherington.                         
 Stanley Pontlarge Church has fine     
 Norman doorways to South and North.A  
 pair of bells hang in the belfrey and 
 there is a mass dial on the South wall</content>
