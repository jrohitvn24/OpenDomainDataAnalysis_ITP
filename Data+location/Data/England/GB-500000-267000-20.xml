		<content> The only recreational facility that   
 exists in Shelton are the swimming    
 lessons that are given to the children
 of all the surrounding villages. This 
 is a privately run enterprise which   
 was set up as a new venture this year.
 The lady who runs the classes is a    
 fully qualified instructor. She has   
 also been on a course dealing with the
 giving of birth in water.

 the village of Dean.

 the homes of various people and fund

 peoples homes.
