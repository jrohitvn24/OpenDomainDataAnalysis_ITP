		<content> On the 6th June 1985, our school went 
 to Northfield Farm to find out about  
 ponies. The ponies need shoeing every 
 3 weeks because, with new riders,     
 their shoes get worn out quickly.     
 They have 35 ponies and they all have 
 names. They buy their ponies from     
 Market. They have cross breeds which  
 are more suitable for trecking. They  
 start grooming and tacking at half    
 past 8. A group of deaf people came   
 to_day so it took longer than normal  
 because they had to explain in sign   
 language. The ponies do not go with   
 people until the ponies are 7 years   
 old because then they aren't so       
 frisky. People come from all over the 
 place to ride at Northfield Farm. The 
 ponies aren't the only income. They   
 also have holiday flats and do farming
 but ponies get the most income.
