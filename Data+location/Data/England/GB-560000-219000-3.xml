		<title>03Employment in Dunmow</title>
		<content>   Approximately 34% of the working    
 population in Dunmow are employed     
 outside the district. Many of these   
 commute by car to larger towns nearby 
 like Chelmsford, Braintree, Harlow and
 Bishop's Stortford. Others travel by  
 car or train to London.               
   Out of Dunmow's total work force 24%
 have jobs in manufacturing industry   
 with jobs ranging from managerial     
 posts and directorships of firms to   
 skilled and semi-skilled workers. 30% 
 work in service industries; 22% in    
 distribution and catering; 13% in the 
 construction industry; and 6% in      
 transport work.                       
   Only about 2% work on farms. This is
 surprising since Dunmow is a rural    
 area but it can be explained by the   
 great increase in farm mechanisation. 
   Unemployment in Dunmow is low at 3% 
 compared with the rest of the country.</content>
