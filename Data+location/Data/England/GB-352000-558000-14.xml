		<title>14More on housing.</title>
		<content> Council houses were built along the   
 Warwick Road between-wars. More       
 Council house and private building has
 gone on behind this earlier           
 development.                          
 In the 1960's, between Warwick and    
 Gelt Road a large estate of council   
 houses and flats were built.{The      
{estate is locally known as 'Jerusalem'
{because, with its pale yellow brick   
{and flat roofs it resembles housing in
{Palestine.}The flats are occupied by  
 elderly retired people.               
 A new private estate is now under     
 construction behind Front Street,     
 Brampton. Milton has grown little,    
 with only the addition of a few       
 council houses and a row of old       
 peoples homes. In Farlam, two stone   
 built barns have been converted into  
 dwellings and a few modern houses     
 added to the small community.         </content>
