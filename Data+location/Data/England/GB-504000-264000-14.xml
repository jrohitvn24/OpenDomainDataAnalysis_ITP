		<title>14Shopping in Swineshead</title>
		<content> The village is very well blessed with 
 visits of mobile shops coming in from 
 surrounding towns and villages. There 
 is a bread van that comes round on    
 Monday, Wednesday and Friday it comes 
 from Dean. If you you ring an order   
 through you can get anything delivered
 from shoe laces to a joint of meat.   
 Milk is delivered 3 days a week. 2    
 butchers and 2 fresh fishmen also     
 visit and there is even a mobile shop 
 to keep the village pets happy.       
 The village is also visited by the    
 mobile library on a fortnightly basis.
 There is a reasonable bus service from
 Bedford to Swineshead. Most days there
 is a morning and evening service, plus
 during the day other buses go through.
 There is also a bus that runs through 
 Swineshead and onto St. Neots.
