		<title>02BELAS KNAP - Pt.1</title>
		<content> This Neolithic chambered tomb,possibly
 dating from 3000 BC, is the earliest  
 evidence of human settlement in the{  
{Winchcombe}area. (1)                  
 The route to Belas Knap passes along  
 narrow, steep Corndean Lane, itself   
 500 years old. Turning right up a     
 footpath Belas Knap stands 950 feet   
 above sea-level, on the brow of the   
 escarpment above Humblebee How plant- 
 ation.                                
 Belas Knap Barrow is 170ft.long,60ft  
 wide and 12ft.high. At the front of   
 the mound is a false portal,consisting
 of a stone lintel resting on two      
 uprights. Inside the long barrow,     
 archaeologists found the remains of a 
 twenty year old man and five children.
 To the side of Belas Knap are four    
 chambers, which may have been covered 
 seperately before being further       
 covered by the main barrow.  (2)      </content>
