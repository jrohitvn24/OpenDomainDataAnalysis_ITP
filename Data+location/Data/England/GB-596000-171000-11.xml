		<title>11Connetts Farm Eastchurch</title>
		<content>  The farmer runs a 135 acre farm which
 has been in the family since 1956,    
 though he has only been{farming}it    
 during the last 5 years.              
   Along with 2 assistants he operates 
 a mixed farming system enabling him to
 rotate{crops.}"Also," says the farmer 
 "we work on the theory that should one
 crop prove a disaster the others may  
 make up for it."                      
   Recent trends affecting Connetts    
 include the use of new chemicals,     
 increased{farm mechanisation}(all     
 machinery is farmer owned) and        
 the introduction of more prolific     
 breeds of{sheep.}                     
   The winter of 1984/5 was bad and    
 this resulted in a very good tilth    
 where the land had been ploughed in   
 the autumn  but the sheep in the      
 fields were hit very hard.
