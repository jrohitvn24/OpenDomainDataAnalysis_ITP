     Our area consists of three hamlets
 - Westby, Ballam and Moss Side; and   
one village - Wrea Green.   Most of our
area covers the countryside, and there 
are many farms and fields which have   
ponds in them.   A railway track,      
joining Kirkham with Blackpool runs    
straight through the block.   It       
crosses a level crossing at Moss Side. 
Near here there is a hospital which    
looks after patients who are           
convalescing.   There is also a        
caravan site.     Although there are a 
few council houses by the level        
crossing you would also see some       
bungalows and detached houses.   The   
houses at Westby and Ballam are        
similar.  In our block the views       
across the flat fields from the        
country lanes are beautiful.   In Wrea 
Green there are five shops.            </content>
