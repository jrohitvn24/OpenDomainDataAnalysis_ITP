		<content> Thomas Bewick-born at Cherryburn Farm,
 Mickley 1753, died 1828- was certainly
 Northumberland's most famous artist.  
 He is renowned throughout the world.  
 He brought the art form of engraving  
 on wood from crudeness to a degree of 
 technical perfection which has still  
 not been exceeded.                    
 The small Bewick family farm came up  
 for sale in 1982-almost unchanged in  
 appearance since the early 1800's- so 
 a group decided to form a Trust to    
 purchase and operate it as in Bewick's
 day; to show through the existing     
 landscape how the countryside         
 influenced Bewick's work, and to form 
 a museum.
