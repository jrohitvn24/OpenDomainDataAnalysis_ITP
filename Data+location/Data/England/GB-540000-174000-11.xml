		<content>Originally most of the area of Eltham  
was woodland except for an area of     
sandy soil on which the first          
settlement in Eltham developed.In the  
middle ages the woodland became royal  
forest.By the seventeenth and          
eighteenth centuries much of the       
woodland had been cleared for farming  
purposes.By the late nineteenth century
Eltham was being developed as a        
residential area.Today Eltham is a     
densely populated residential suburb of
London.Population approximately 73,000.
