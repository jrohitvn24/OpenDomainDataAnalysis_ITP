		<title>11The Coach and Horses</title>
		<content> Before the Coach and Horses was a pub 
 it was a working dairy farm.In 1914 it
 was sold by Mr.Lancaster to a brewery 
 for Â£1400.It was formally called the  
 Fair House because the local farmers  
 held a fair in the field by the pub   
 during the 19th.century.The pub still 
 has a cooking range,tiled floor,bar,  
 parlour and 4 bedrooms.The landlord,  
 Mr.Whitehead,sells Robinson's beer in 
 36 gallon barrels.He sells 12 barrels 
 in the summer and 5 in the winter per 
 week.Only a few barrels are wooden,   
 most are metal.A pint of beer costs   
 76p,six years ago it cost 43p.He      
 employs 21 staff at various times of  
 the week.Mrs.Whitehead prepares food. 
 They like to encourage families to    
 come to the pub.They have a children's
 playground.Every year they hold a     
 sponsored 5 mile run and they raise   
 alot of money for charity.            </content>
