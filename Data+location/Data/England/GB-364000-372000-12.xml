 ICI ALTHOUGH THERE ARE MANY OTHER     
 SMALLER INDUSTRIES IN THE AREA.       
 ICI BEGAN IN NORTHWICH AND THERE ARE 3
 LARGE CHEMICAL PLANTS IN THE AREA AT  
 PRESENT.THE MAIN REASON FOR ICI BEING 
 IN THE AREA IS THE MINERALS IN THE    
 GROUND.HOWEVER AS THESE HAVE BEEN USED
 UP THE RAW MATERIALS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT
 IN FROM OTHER AREAS.ONE OF THE ICI    
 PLANTS WILL SOON SHUT DOWN WHICH WILL 
 MEAN A MOVEMENT OF PRODUCTION TO      
 RUNCORN,A MORE PRACTICAL LOCATION.

 DEVELOPED OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS 
 AND HAS RECENTLY BOUGHT NEW PREMISES  
 ON A DEVELOPMENT PARK AT THE EDGE OF  
 THE TOWN.MANY OF THE SMALL INDUSTRIES 
 IN NORTHWICH HAVE SOME LINK WITH      
 ICI AND THIS IS THE CASE HERE FOR ICI
