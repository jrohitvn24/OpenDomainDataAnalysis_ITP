		<title>09Music Wantage Silver Band</title>
		<content> A conductor and trainer of the Wantage
 Silver Band, who lives in Grove, came 
 to school to talk about the Band,     
 started 12 years ago by Doug Brand. He
 tried to find enough adults to play,  
 but soon found it would be better to  
 train children. Now parents have      
 joined the band, open to all ages, and
 there are about 125 members, some     
 whole family units.  About a third of 
 the members are from Grove and every  
 year the Band plays on the Village    
 Green at the Mayfair. I live in Grove 
 and my mother and sister are  both    
 members of the Band. The Band helps   
 the district in processions, fetes,   
 taking part in competitions, giving   
 concerts. They also visit Grove for   
 carol singing. The band is now very   
 popular and The Grove and Wantage     
 people are very proud to be members of
 it.                                   </content>
