		<title>13Health in The Shelsleys</title>
		<content>   The health of this district is      
 generally good. Free medical advice is
 available at two local{medical        
{practices}, situated at Great Witley  
 and Knightwick, both of them sharing a
 surgery at Clifton. Both practices    
 will visit patients at home and       
 dispense medicines, although there is 
 a prescription charge which most      
 patients must pay. The G.P. can also  
 arrange visits by the district nurse  
 or the midwife. Women are advised to  
 have their babies in hospital and they
 are visited daily on their return by a
 midwife until the baby is ten days    
 old. Thereafter checks and            
 immunizations are given at local baby 
 clinics. There is a free ambulance    
 service for patients attending        
 hospital, free eye tests and free     
 dental inspection every six months,the
 nearest dentist being ten miles away. </content>
