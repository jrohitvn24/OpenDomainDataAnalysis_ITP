 Interviews....Present to Future.      
                                       
 The people we interviewed all said    
 that they did not want any more       
 factories built in Huntington.        
 Everyone said that there were no      
 places for recreation, so in the      
 future there should be places for both
 young people and old people to meet.  
 There are shortages of certain shops, 
 only one chemist, one bank and two    
 post offices.                         
 There are no sports facilities at all,
 and the Yearsley swimming bath is old 
 and costly to run. The river needs to 
 be cleaned up and footpaths along the 
 river should be built so that people  
 can walk there.
