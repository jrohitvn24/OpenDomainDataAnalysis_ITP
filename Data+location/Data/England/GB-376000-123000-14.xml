		<content> Up Heavland Lane I noticed the old    
 quarry was getting filled up with mud 
 from the hole which the new sewerage  
 works will be put in.The works foreman
 said the quarry will soon be a field  
 again.As I went on up the track I saw 
 two cornfields,one silage field and   
 the rest of the fields were for hay.  
   I went to Stour Close and there were
 nine bungalows. There were nineteen in
 Witch Close. The scrap yard was still 
 a scrap yard. There is a weighbridge  
 too. The White Horse Inn is now an    
 Embassy School of Motoring. Opposite  
 there is a well, in fenced off land   
 marked 'Private'.
