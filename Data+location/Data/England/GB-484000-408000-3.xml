		<title>03Parkwood Estate.</title>
		<content> I live on Plymouth Road.              
 This is part of the Parkwood Estate.  
 It was started about 19 years ago and 
 is still being developed.             
 The housing is very mixed.            
 There is still some grassland in front
 of my house.                          
 We cross it to go to my school.       
 A few years ago it was all rough land.
 Now, part of the land is taken up by  
 houses and small flats.               
 They say that the rest of the land    
 might have shops built on it.         
 Behind the houses on Plymouth Road,   
 to the East, there are allotments.    
 Quibell Park is just to the north.    
 This is used for sports events and    
 events like 'Family Weekend'.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
