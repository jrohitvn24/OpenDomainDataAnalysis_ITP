		<title>01OUR AREA- INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content>      The area we have surveyed lies   
 three miles to the south of the City  
 of Wakefield.  Here the landscape     
 changes as we leave the city and enter
 a more rural area.  Here we leave     
 the housing estates behind us and     
 enter an area composed of             
 fields,woodland and villages.  Much   
 of the area is farmland and there is  
 little real industry.                 
      The north of the area is almost  
 entirely covered by housing since this
 is part of the suburbs of Wakefield.A 
 huge council estate sits on the north 
 westcorner of the area  whilst to the 
 north west new, high cost housing has 
 sprung up around what were isolated   
 hamlets and villages.                 
      The south of the area is regarded
 locally as an area of beauty. The most
 noticeable part of this is the        
 Newmillerdam Country Park.            </content>
