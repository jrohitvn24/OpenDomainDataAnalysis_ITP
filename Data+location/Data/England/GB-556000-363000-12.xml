		<content>{The Old Fire Station :}two fire       
 engines were kept in what is now the  
 furniture shop. A third engine was    
 kept on Richmond Drive in the Coop    
 garage. When there was a fire a call  
 boy would run to the railway station  
 where there was a fire bell. The boy  
 would ring the bell to tell the men   
 that the horses were required to pull 
 the fire engine. The horses were kept 
 in a field on Richmond Drive. The Fire
 Station was built onto the Town Hall. 
 There were 10 full time and ten part  
 time firemen.In the {modern fire      
{station (1973)}the fire engines are   
 kept in a garage next to the station. 
 Radio alarms called alerters summon   
 the fire men to the engines. There is 
 a lot of paper work for the firemen to
 do. Firemen also do fire checks on    
 guest houses and hotels. They have 4  
 engines and 2 special alert engines.  </content>
