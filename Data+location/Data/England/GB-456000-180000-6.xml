		<title>06THE RIDGEWAY</title>
		<content>       The Ridgeway is a very old path 
 in Britain. It is 144km long and about
 4 metres wide in some places. Most    
 people use it for{recreation}eg.riding
 horses and walking.                   
                                       
      The Ridgeway is also a{historic  
 feature. It was first used in the     
 Bronze Age and later used for taking  
 animals to market, which is why it is 
 wide enough to enable one flock of    
 sheep to pass another.                
                                       
      The{landscape}around is mostly   
 farmland, both arable and pasture.    
                                       
      Many{tourists}visit the Ridgeway 
 either to admire the view, or to walk 
 it. There are small hotels and youth  
 hostels off the Ridgeway, or some     
 people prefer to camp.
