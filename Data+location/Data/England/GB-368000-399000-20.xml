		<content>  THE WILD PLANTS AROUND US ARE:       
{MARESTAIL, DAISY, COMMON BINDWEED,    
{SHEPHERD'S PURSE, LADIES' BEDSTRAW,   
{BUTTERCUP, SOFT MEADOW_GRASS, YARROW, 
{DEAD NETTLES, STINGING NETTLES,       
{DANDELION, COMMON FORGET_ME_NOT AND   
{DOCK LEAVES.}IN THE RESIDENTIAL AREA  
 CLOSE TO OUR SCHOOL, WILD PLANTS HAVE 
 FOUND UNUSUAL PLACES TO GROW. SUCH AS 
 IN{BETWEEN THE PATH, IN THE GUTTER, IN
{AN OLD TIN CAN AND IN AN OLD CAR ON   
{THE DUMP.}THESE WILD PLANTS ARE ABLE  
 TO ADAPT TO VARIED GROWING PLACES AND 
 SPREAD THEIR SEEDS WIDELY. IN SUMMER  
 1984 OUR GARDENERS SPAYED WEED KILLER 
 AROUND OUR MOBILE CLASSROOM. AS A     
 RESULT ALL THE PLANTS DIED. IN 1985   
 THESE WILD PLANTS HAVE GROWN AGAIN:   
{BUTTERCUP, MAYWEED, SYCAMORE,         
{HOARY PLANTAIN, SHEPHERD'S PURSE,     
{MARESTAIL AND THE THISTLE.
