		<title>15A FARMER'S WIFE'S DAY</title>
		<content> The men rise about{6.45}for early jobs
 of feeding animals and milking the    
 house cow.  The wife rises about      
{7.30,}calls the children and prepares 
 breakfast.  The chidren are taken to  
 school or to catch the school bus.    
 The hens and cats are fed, and        
 household chores begun.  Housework and
 cooking fill a lot of time, with      
 interruptions for coffee and visiting 
 travellers.                           
 There are generally{three meals}to be 
 cooked a day.  Teas are often taken   
 out to fields in haytime.             
 Some farmer's wives help with{tractor 
{work}and animals, and all who drive   
 collect spare parts and do messages   
 for the farm.  They pay bills and shop
 when collecting children, and do      
{bookwork}in the evening.{Decorating   
 the house and{gardening}are wife's    
 work.                                 </content>
