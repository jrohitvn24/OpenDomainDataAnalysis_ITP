		<title>05TRANSPORT IN KENDAL</title>
		<content>  Traffic in Kendal used to be so heavy
 that in{1968}Kendal's notorious       
{one-way system}was introduced.  People
 travelling to the{Lakes}and especially
{Windermere}did not like this. The{M6  
 was built in{October 1970,}the Kendal 
 by-pass was built in{August 1971}and  
 Kendal{Link Road}in{March 1975.}All   
 these roads are needed to combat the  
 steady summer traffic through Kendal  
 Town Centre.                          
  From a small survey we found that{580
 vehicles left Kendal in an hour and   
{444}vehicles entered Kendal.Out of    
 these figures{80%}were cars and the   
 other{20%}were buses and vans.        
  The survey, carried out on the North 
 and South sides of Kendal also showed 
 that{360}out of{1024}cars,ie{35.1%    
 were purchased locally (the Kendal    
 area). This gives some indication of  
 tourist traffic.                      </content>
