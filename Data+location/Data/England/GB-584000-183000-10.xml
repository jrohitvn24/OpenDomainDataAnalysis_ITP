		<title>10Bell Wharf</title>
		<content> Bell Wharf is a platform that juts out
 into the sea. In the 1800's there was 
 a pub called The Bell. It was owned by
 a man called Laurence Lazarus. He     
 built a sloping landing place to get  
 his drinks for his pub. Boats used to 
 bring all he needed to this landing   
 place. The fishermen used it for      
 hauling their fish off their boats.   
 The pub was knocked down to make way  
 for the railway. The rubble from the  
 pub was used to make the sloping      
 platform bigger. That is why it is    
 called Bell Wharf.                    
 When we went to visit it, we met the  
 Foreshore Inspector, Mr D Jones, who  
 looks after the foreshore from        
 Chalkwell to Two Tree Island. We saw a
 boat lifted out of the water for      
 inspection. Fishing and pleasure boats
 now use Bell Wharf.
