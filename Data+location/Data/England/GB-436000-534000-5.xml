		<content> SOME CHILDREN LIKE TO PLAY "MAY,I" AT 
 SCHOOL OR AT HOME."MAY,I" IS A GAME   
 WHICH YOU PLAY LIKE THIS; THE PERSON  
 WHO IS "ON" STANDS ABOUT 2 METRES AWAY
 FROM THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT ON.THE    
 PERSON WHO IS "ON" SAYS TO ONE OF THE 
 CHILDREN "TAKE A LAMP-POST." A        
 LAMP-POST IS WHERE YOU LIE ON THE     
 FLOOR AND STRETCH YOUR HANDS.THEN YOU 
 GET UP AND STAND WHERE YOUR HANDS     
 REACHED BUT FIRST YOU MUST SAY "MAY,I"
 IF YOU DON'T  YOU WILL HAVE TO GO BACK
 TO THE START.AFTER YOU HAVE HAD YOUR  
 TURN THE PERSON WHO IS "ON"  GOES TO  
 THE NEXT PERSON AND TO THE NEXT.THE   
 WINNER IS THE FIRST ONE WHO REACHES   
 THE PERSON WHO IS "ON".THERE ARE OTHER
 THINGS TO SAY LIKE,"TAKE A BABY STEP" 
 OR "TAKE A GIANT STRIDE." I DO NOT    
 PLAY IT ALL THE TIME AT SCHOOL BUT I  
 LIKE TO PLAY IT AT HOME. SHEILA WOOD.
