Great Doddington has a village hall    
which was built in memory of the       
villagers who died in the wars. It     
consists of a large hall, a committee  
room, a stage, a kitchen and toilets.  
It is used by all the village          
organisations for their meetings and   
extra functions and provides a focal   
point for village activities. It is    
also hired out to people for private   
functions and the revenue raised goes  
towards the upkeep of the hall. The    
costs have risen considerably in recent
years and fund-raising events have to  
be organised. The main money comes from
the village fete on the second Saturday
in June each year and this year 500    
pounds was raised. It is an occasion   
when all the village organisations     
including the village school rally     
round.                                 </content>
