		<title>20THE TWENTIETH CENTURY</title>
		<content>   The twentieth century is filled with
 computers, videos, compact discs and  
 stereos. In nearly every home there is
 at least one of these items. When my  
 parents were my age they had none of  
 these.                                
   Some people do not like computers   
 becausethey think that they will take 
 over in factories and offices and then
 people wont have jobs. At the         
 beginning of the twentieth century    
 jobs were easy to find but now, near  
 the end of the century, jobs are hard 
 to find. When I start looking for a   
 job it will be very hard to find one. 
 Even if I have good qualifications I  
 may not get a job.                    
   I hope that the twenty-first century
 will be much better than this one, and
 that computers will not have taken    
 over everything.
