		<content> Where the Cubs meet used to be the    
 farm barn.Every Wednesday at 6.30.we  
 go to Cubs and 8.00 we go home.The    
 wall beside our hut is made of flint. 
 The field which the animals were put  
 in, used to have fencing around.The   
 wall is very long it also is made of  
 flint . They are both very old and    
 the barn has smashed windows &amp; the    
 roof is in a bad way .

 During the Second World War childen   
 used to carry a satchel with gas masks
 in. In an air raid they had air raid  
 shelters;they used to have to walk    
 along the playground to get to them.  
 We have found some air raid shelters  
 around the school but they are blocked
 up now but you can still see the      
 entrance to them.
