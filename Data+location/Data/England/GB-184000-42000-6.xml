		<content> One of our Cornish customs is the     
 Helston Flora.Helston is a pretty     
 little town and every year they       
 decorate the streets and the ladies   
 dress up in their nicest dresses and  
 the men wear tail coats and top hats  
 then they dance through the streets   
 accompanied by brass bands playing the
 Furry Dance.There are several dances  
 during the day and they go all through
 the streets.The children,s dance is   
 usually held in the morning and the   
 grown ups later on.Thousands of people
 come to watch the dancers and there is
 a fair held at the same time in       
 another part of the town where there  
 are amusements and stalls selling lots
 of different things from clothes to   
 crockery.In 1982 the song about the   
 Flora was in the Top Ten when it was  
 sung by Terry Wogan.
