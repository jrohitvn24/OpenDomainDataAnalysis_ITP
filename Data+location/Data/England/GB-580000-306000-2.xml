		<title>02TRANSPORT IN SWAFFHAM</title>
		<content> Swaffham's situation provides good    
 opportunities for road transport      
 links.The main 'A' roads link the town
 with King's Lynn, Norwich and the     
 south, via the A11 and M11.           
 Formerly the town was also connected  
 to the main rail links but the line   
 was closed in the 1960's.             
 Public Transport is now provided by   
 bus and coach services which are      
 maintained by both local and national 
 companies.                            
 In 1981 the town was bypassed,        
 diverting the A47 to the north of the 
 town in a part single, part           
 dual-carriageway route, leaving the   
 town free from the summer jams of     
 holiday traffic.
