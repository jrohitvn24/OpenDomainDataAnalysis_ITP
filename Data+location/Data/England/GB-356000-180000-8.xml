		<content>   The Patchway we live in now is      
 boring.                               
 They want to build houses everywhere  
 there is a space.  People are signing 
 a petition to get an adventure        
 playground instead of houses.         
   I'd like a Sports Centre where the  
 woods are.  The only good place we    
 have is the BMX track where they have 
 racing.  BMX's are bicycles used only 
 for off the road use.  They have a    
 park called "Scott Park".  It used to 
 be good until some vandals got there  
   In the park they used to have       
 a big slider and a witch's hat and it 
 spins round.  They have taken it away 
 now.                                  
   We would all go to the Sports Centre
 if we had one.  We have to go a long  
 way to go to somewhere good.
