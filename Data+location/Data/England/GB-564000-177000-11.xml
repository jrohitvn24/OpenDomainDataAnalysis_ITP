		<content>   There are many pubs in our patch.   
 These are just some of them:One at    
 Chadwell which used to be called{The  
{Robinson Crusoe}has recently been     
 renamed Daniels,and it now has a      
 cocktail bar and a beer house.        
   At West Tilbury the pub is called   
 the Kings{Head}which is a very old    
 pub.This is on the {Village Green }and
 in the summer adults can drink outside
 and children can play there.{         
{ }At Linford there is{The George and  
{Dragon}which is on the main road away 
 from the houses but still seems very  
 popular.                              
   Also at Chadwell is {The Crosskeys.}
 It is about a mile away from{Daniels }
 so it doesn't matter about trade.Just 
 up the road from{The Crosskeys}is the 
 Chadwell Working- Mens Club.So you can
 see that there are quite a few pubs in
 our area.                             </content>
