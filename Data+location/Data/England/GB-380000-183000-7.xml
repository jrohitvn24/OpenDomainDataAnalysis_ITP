		<content> Luckington County Primary School is a 
 two teacher village school.There are  
 24 children in the school.The school  
 is housed in one large Victorian      
 building and an adjacent Pratten      
 building.The Pratten building is used 
 by the local Playgroup and also acts  
 as the dining room for the school     
 children.Outside there are grassed    
 areas,flower beds,a pond and two      
 playgrounds,as well as two storage    
 sheds and a garage.                   
 Most of the schoolchildren live in the
 village or in nearby Alderton.At one  
 time the headmaster lived in the rooms
 above the ground floor;these are now  
 the school office and stock rooms.The 
 school meals are brought in daily from
 Hullavington School.                  
 The school hours are from 9.00 to
