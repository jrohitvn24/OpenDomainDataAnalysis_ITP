 road from the Golf Course.It is mainly
 a dairy farm but the occasional wheat 
 crop is grown.There are a few         
 residents living in farm property that
 have nothing to do with the farm but

 houses are farm hands or owners of    
 land.A big pond is next to two of the 
 houses on which ducks and fish        
 swim.The owner of the farm lives in a 
 big house on the outskirts of the     
 farm.There are about three acres of   
 farm land.A long drive leads up to the

 by ash and other trees.In the         
 hedgerows grow Dog Daisies,Poppies and
 Fox-gloves.They milk the cows at six  
 o'clock in the morning and four       
 o'clock in the afternoon.After which
