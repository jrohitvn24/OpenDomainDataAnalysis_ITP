		<title>11HALE PARISH COUNCIL</title>
		<content>  The Parish Councillors are chosen by 
 vote every four years,the number,     
 six,being determined by the number of 
 people on the Electoral Roll. They    
 meet each month in the Village Hall,  
 although the law requires only four   
 meetings a year.                      
  Currently the Council is concerned   
 with the erosion of the verges by cars
 in Tethering Drove.                   
  The use of the Village Green also    
 gives rise to many problems.Until     
 February,1975 it was not known who    
 legally owned the green. The Parish   
 Council therefore held a ceremony in  
 which the Chairman dug up a piece of  
 earth on the Green and "seized the    
 land for the benefit in perpetuity of 
 the inhabitants of Hale".             
  Before the District Planning Officer 
 grants planning permission for build- 
 ing the Councillors must approve it.  </content>
