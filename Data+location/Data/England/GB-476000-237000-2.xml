		<title>02Alms Houses,Calverton 1985</title>
		<content>  The Alms houses were built for poor  
and needy people.There were 6 Alms     
houses, 4 for people from Calverton    
and 2 from Beachampton.The cottages    
had 1 room upstairs and 1 room         
downstairs, there wasn't any mains     
water only a water pump outside the    
cottages.They were built in 1830 by    
Charles George   Percival who was the  
rector of the parish for 38 years.     
   These cottages were modernized in   
1978. They were made into three        
cottages.On the west wall there is a   
plaque that says" DEO AC PAUPERIBUS    
MDCCCXXX" meaning To god and the poor  
1830".                                 
   We visited a lady who has lived in  
Calverton for 50 years she told us     
that you didn't have to pay rents or   
rates years ago,because there wasn't   
any mains water, but they do have  to  
pay rent nowadays.                     </content>
