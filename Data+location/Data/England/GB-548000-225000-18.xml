		<title>18A Typical day in Manuden 1</title>
		<content> It was midnight on Monday. It was very
 quiet because nearly everybody was    
 asleep. Some people were just going to
 bed. A few cars were going by. At one 
 o'clock it was even quieter because   
 now apart from a few people everyone  
 was asleep. There are no birds. There 
 are no lights on now.Between three and
 four o'clock the birds start to wake  
 up but it is still quite peaceful. At 
 five o'clock some dads that have a    
 long way to drive to work are getting 
 up now. Nearly all the birds were     
 singing. Between six and seven the    
 milkman starts his rounds. Now lots   
 more people are getting up. At eight  
 o'clock everybody is awake. Children  
 are now on their way to school either 
 by coach, car or walking. Dads are    
 going to work. At nine o'clock all the
 children are going inside to start    
 their work.                           </content>
