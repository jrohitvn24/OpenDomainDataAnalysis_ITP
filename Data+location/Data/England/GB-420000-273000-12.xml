		<content> The school was extended in 1932 with  
 extra classrooms and a science        
 laboratory. Electricity was put in to 
 light the school but water was still  
 pumped from outside until the 1950's  
 and there were outside toilets. During
 the war the school was  used as a     
 resting area for the people living in 
 Coventry suffering from air raids and 
 for evacuees.  Hot dinners were       
 introduced in 1946.                   
 A swimming pool was added with the    
 help of the P.T.A. in 1970. The size  
 of the village increased and the      
 school became more and more           
 overcrowded until in 1979 with numbers
 of over 500 a new school was built    
 attached to the old one. This gave us 
 six more classes and a new hall. We   
 still use four temporary huts.
