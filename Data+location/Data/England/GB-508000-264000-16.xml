		<title>16PERTENHALL MANOR</title>
		<content>{   Pertenhall Manor}is a listed Tudor 
 building.In 1870 one half was rebuilt.
 The external facade now rendered      
 retains its Tudor style, the internal 
 architecture is a mixture of the      
 Tudor, Stuart and Victorian periods,  
 with some unique Victorian stained    
 glass windows. The dining room still  
 retains its superb oak panelling      
 dating back to Charles I.             
    The manor stands in 8 acres and is 
 practically self sufficient.The lands 
 are mentioned in the Domesday Book and
 the present tennis court is the site  
 of a Cromwellian burial ground.       
    The present owners have lived in   
 the manor for twelve years,and it is  
 essentially a home with all the rooms 
 in use,as they have a large family.   
    The beautiful gabled house is said 
 to have a ghost, but the house has a  
 serene almost magical atmosphere.     </content>
