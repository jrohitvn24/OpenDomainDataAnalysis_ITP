		<title>17Hobbies of People in Occold.</title>
		<content>On this Domesday project I have been   
doing about hobbies.The favourite is   
gardening because people have bigger   
gardens around here.Cycling is the next
because there are lot of country roads 
for sight seeing and children cycle    
alot.In the winter the favourite hobby 
is watching television because of the  
weather.In the summer many people enjoy
horse riding because we have found     
there are many green lanes in the area 
where people can keep of the roads.One 
of the most worthwhile hobbies is      
helping the handicapped.Many of the    
women in the village do knitting and   
reading.The children support various   
football clubs and watch them play     
either on the television or go to watch
Ipswich at Portman Road.My favourite   
hobby is bird watching and I especially
like watching birds of prey at Green   
Farm.                                  </content>
