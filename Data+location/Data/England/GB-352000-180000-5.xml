		<content> The householders living in Hallen and 
 the surrounding small farms have one  
 village shop.There is no fresh fish   
 for sale, choice is limited and prices
 higher than in a supermarket.Life for 
 the elderly and infirm is difficult as
 the nearest shops at Crow Lane Henbury
 are 1\miles away, an uphill walk.     
 Westbury village,3 miles away, is on  
 the bus route,  return fare is 87p    
 senior citizens receive tokens valued 
 at Â£6 per year to help them with      
 fares. The travelling  library calls  
 at Hallen once a month.A number of    
 families have domestic pets and there 
 are kennels for boarding cats and dogs
 situated on Hallen marsh.             
 School children are bussed long       
 distances for their education.
