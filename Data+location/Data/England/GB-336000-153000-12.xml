		<content>   THE MAKING OF CHEESE HAS CHANGED    
FROM A COTTAGE INDUSTRY INTO A         
MANUFACTURING PROCESS ON A LARGE SCALE.
   CHEESE MAKING TAKES PLACE IN EARLY  
SUMMER WHEN THERE IS A SULPHUS OF MILK,
I.E THERE IS MORE MILK PRODUCED THAN IS
NEEDED FOR DRINKING.                   
   THE MILK FOR CHEESE IS PLACED IN A  
LARGE DOUBLE SKINNED,STAINLESS STEEL   
CONTAINER AND WARMED GENTLY.A STARTER  
SOLUTION IS ADDED AND THE MILK IS      
STIRRED.AN ACID STATE IS               
REACHED,STIRRING IS STOPPED AND THE    
MILK BECOMES A LARGE JUNKET.THIS JUNKET
IS CUT INTO CUBES,FROM THIS THE WHEY IS
TAKEN OFF.TO THE SEMI SOLID SALT IS    
ADDED.IT IS TURNED,CUT AND KNEEDED.IT  
IS THEN SHREDDED,PLACED INTO A         
CONTAINER AND PRESSED.                 
   CHEDDAR CHEESE NEEDS SIX MONTHS TO  
MATURE AND IS TURNED EVERYDAY.
