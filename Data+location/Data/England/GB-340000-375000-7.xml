		<content> With the opening of the Boat Museum in
 1976 came a revival in interest in the
 life style and customs of the families
 who had once worked and lived on the  
 canals. This way of life had all but  
 disappeared by the 1960's, but        
 memories are kept alive by present day
 activity connected with the Boat      
 Museum.                               
 At Easter an annual boat rally takes  
 place for pleasure craft and restored 
 working boats. In September there is a
 steam rally,but this year the largest 
 event was the {International Waterways
{Festival}. Over 3 days this attracted 
 17,000 visitors.                      
 Folk traditions are kept alive by a   
 group called "The Cut Above" folk club
 who perform song and dance in         
 traditional costume.
