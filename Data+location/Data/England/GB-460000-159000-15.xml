		<title>15Violin Maker</title>
		<content> Some of our class went to visit an    
 elderly man called Mr. Perry who is a 
 violin maker.We were a small group of 
 six and Mr. Perry seemed very pleased.
 He told us that he used maple wood for
 the back and sides of the violin and  
 spruce for the front.He made the bow  
 out of horses hairs.It takes 600_700  
 hours to make a complete violin.The   
 back of a violin costs Â£105.00 and the
 neck costs Â£90.00.When he makes a     
 violin he charges Â£1000.00 but really 
 he should charge around Â£4000.00.     
     He makes different sizes of       
 violins,they are a quarter,half and   
 full size.He also makes the viola,    
 'cello, and double bass.Apart from    
 musical instruments Mr. Perry makes   
 a variety of wooden articles including
 plates,bowls,solitare and cribbage    
 boards.I think he is an excellent     
 craftsman.                            </content>
