		<title>04HER MAJESTY'S VISIT</title>
		<content>   On Friday, 7th May, the Queen came  
 to Colchester. She came mainly to open
 the new hospital in Myland. She was   
 also going to the University and the  
 Town Hall.                            
   About 3 000 children were up at the 
 University. Our school arrived at the 
 University at about 10.30. We had to  
 wait for about an hour and fifteen    
 minutes before she arrived. In that   
 space of time we had a chat with a    
 policeman. There were also policemen  
 on top of the tall buildings.         
   Before the Queen came there was an  
 escort. The Queen was wearing a green 
 coat and a red hat. She came past us  
 on the other side so we couldn't see  
 her. Down at the place where she went 
 in there were hundreds of people. She 
 was staying at the University for an  
 hour. After she had come past the     
 first time we went and got our lunch. </content>
