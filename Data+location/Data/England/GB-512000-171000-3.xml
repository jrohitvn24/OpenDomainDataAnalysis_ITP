		<title>03LONGHURST NURSERY WHITTON</title>
		<content> Longhurst Nursery has stood for over  
 300 years. There have been three      
 owners as far as I know. It used to be
 owned by Mr Longhurst but in 1900 Mr  
 J.Bowman bought it for Â£2000. In 1972 
 Mr P.Bowman his son took it over and  
 he is the present owner. The name of  
 the nursery would have been changed   
 but it was so well known as Longhurst 
 that it kept that name. The nursery is
 20 acres in size. Vegetables used to  
 grow there but now all the            
 vegetables are bought from Western    
 International Market. The nursery     
 grows and sells lots of flowers. Cows 
 are now kept on the field so they dont
 grow corn in the field. The railway   
 track backs right onto the farm so    
 does Heathfield Rec. Before it became 
 a nursery it was a farm where shire   
 horses were used.Now tractors are used
