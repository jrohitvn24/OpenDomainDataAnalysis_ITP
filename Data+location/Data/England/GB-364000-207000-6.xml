		<content>   Oaklands Park in the north-east of  
 the grid is a large country house     
 which was once the home of the        
 Crawshay family. Henry Crawshay, 'The 
 Iron King of the Forest', lived there 
 until his death in 1879. His father   
 had come to the Forest from Wales and 
 by 1841 had acquired 10 iron mines. He
 later owned a number of coal mines and
 a network of tramways.                
   Today the house is part of a        
 country-wide community called the     
 Camphill Village Trust; it provides a 
 caring, sympathetic and               
 self-supporting environment to look   
 after mentally handicapped adults. It 
 successfully farms a substantial      
 acreage using organic methods, makes  
 and sells its own bread and produces  
 wooden toys and beautifully patterned 
 woven materials for retail.
