		<content> This block to{East of Rotherham}      
 contains a mixture of{housing,  }     
{industry and agriculture.}In earlier  
 times the villages of{Dalton}and      
{Thrybergh}were seperated from         
 Rotherham by fields. Now they are     
 joined into one continuous settlement 
 as{housing estates}have been built    
 since the 1900s. Some of the area is  
 run down, but new properties have been
 built and some of the poorest houses  
 have been demolished recently. Several
{main roads}cross the area, notably    
 that between{Doncaster}and{Rotherham.}
{Steelworks}and an{industrial estate  }
 fill part of the area near the{River}{
{Don}and the recently  improved        
{Navigation.}Whilst in the East the    
 area is dominated by{Silverwood }     
{Colliery}and the new{Thrybergh Country
{Park.}The area also has a few{small}  
{holdings}and{farms. }                 </content>
