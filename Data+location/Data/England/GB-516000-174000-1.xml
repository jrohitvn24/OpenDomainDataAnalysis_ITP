		<title>01THE WATER SLIDE, RICHMOND</title>
		<content>  The building of {wild waters}was     
 started in February 1984 and it was   
 opened at Easter 1985.They chose to   
 build it in Richmond because it is    
 quite a rich area and they thought    
 people might have enough money to go  
 on it.It costs Â£2.50 for a 40 minute  
 session.Wild waters is the{largest }  
{enclosed water slide in Europe.}There 
 are four flumes altogether.Their names
 are Aquajet,Corkscrew,Twister and     
 Black-Hole.They choose scary names for
 them because they are sort of         
 fun-scary! The flumes are about 100m  
 long and it takes about 40 seconds at 
 the most to go down the slide.You come
 out into a metre-deep plunging pool.If
 you have time,you go for another turn.
 You have to use a mat otherwise you   
 might hurt yourself. The attendant at 
 the top of each slide will tell you   
 exactly what to do!                   </content>
