    Kibworth Beauchamp is well served  
 by local shops. Some of these         
 businesses maintain a continuous,     
 thriving retail trade whilst others   
 tend to be short term ventures and    
 change from one type of shop to       
 another. One problem for some shops is
 the proximity of Leicester and the    
 abundance of motor cars in the        
 village.                              
    Nevertheless, there has been no    
 significant decline in the number of  
 shops in Kibworth over the past ten   
 years. At the present time there are  
 32 shops in Kibworth Beauchamp, one   
 bank, three garages and three building
 societies are represented.            
    The shops mentioned above are      
 listed on the following page.
