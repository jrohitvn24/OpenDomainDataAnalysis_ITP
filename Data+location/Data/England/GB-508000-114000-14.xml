		<content>   Goatchers Nursery has been owned and
 run by the same family since 1845.    
 Sam Goatcher, Great-Great-Grandfather 
 of the present owner, bought the house
 and the first plot of land.  He and   
 his wife planted two cedar trees in   
 front of the house.  Today one still  
 stands, more than one hundred feet in 
 height. Many of the greenhouses are   
 still on foundations laid in 1845.  At
 present the firm concentrates on      
 propagating and selling ornamental    
 trees, shrubs and herbaceous          
 perennials.
