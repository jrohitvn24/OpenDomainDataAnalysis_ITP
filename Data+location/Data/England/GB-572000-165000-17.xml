There are 2 railway lines passing      
through the area : the line from       
Strood to Maidstone and the line from  
Rochester to London. The lines were    
built in 1855 and were nationalized in 
1948. The lines are administered by    
area operations manager,Mr.Hadley in   
Margate. STROOD TO MAIDSTONE LINE.     
About 25 goods trains a week use this  
line. There is a passenger service,on  
which the trains can hold 250          
people,but most hold around 30. There  
are 3 periods of heavy use at rush     
hours. CHATHAM TO VICTORIA LINE. Only  
1 goods train a day,and an empty coal  
train. The line is heavily used by     
passengers travelling from Medway      
(and beyond) to London (Victoria).
