		<title>02Queen Charlton Village</title>
		<content> Queen Charlton is a small village to  
 the south east of Bristol.It has a    
 population of 71.There are 25 houses  
 of which all are privately owned apart
 from 3 council houses and 2 tied      
 cottages.                             
 There are 4 farms.A few villagers are 
 employed on these,but most people work
 in Bristol or Keynsham.There is no    
 public transport,so cars are          
 essential,especially as the village   
 has no shops,school or pub.It does    
 have a 12th century church,a Norman   
 arch,a medieval priest path and a     
 small village green with a stone      
 cross.The oldest house in the village 
 dates from 1550.                      
 The village used to be known as       
 Charlton.In 1574 after a visit by     
 Queen Elizabeth I,it became Queen     
 Charlton and a charter was granted for
 an annual fair,which is still held.   </content>
