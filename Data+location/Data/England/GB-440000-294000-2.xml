		<title>02Richmond.A playground game.</title>
		<content> This is how you play the  game.       
 You have a ball while the other       
 children run around. When the person  
 who is on gets the ball they have to  
 say "FREEZE!".Everyone should stop as 
 they are and the person who is on     
 rolls the ball to hit someone below   
 the knee.If they hit a person they are
 on and the game starts all over again.
 But if the person who is on does not  
 hit anyone they have to get the ball  
 back, while the others run away. When 
 the person who is on picks up the ball
 they say "FREEZE"again and the game   
 carries on.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
