		<title>11BACON FARM</title>
		<content>   THE MORRIS'S HAVE LIVED IN "BACON   
 FARM" FOR 4\ YEARS. THEY OWN 6 ACRES  
 BUT THE ORIGINAL FARM HAD ABOUT 240   
 ACRES WHICH IS NOW RENTED OUT BY      
 TRUSTEES TO SWALCLIFFE GRANGE. THEY   
 HAVE A SMALLHOLDING WITH SHEEP(10)    
 PIGS(70), CHICKENS/BANTAMS(30) BUT IT 
 IS NOT A BUSINESS CONCERN. THE FARM   
 BUILDINGS ARE AROUND 400 YEARS OLD AND
 WORTH ABOUT Â£70-80,000.  MR.MORRIS IS 
 INVOLVED IN MAKING PLASTICS.          
   THEY DO THEIR SHOPPING IN LOCAL     
 SHOPS, AND A CAR IS ESSENTIAL FOR     
 WHERE THEY LIVE. BEFORE THEY MOVED    
 HERE THEY LIVED IN BURDROP AND        
 MILCOMBE. THEY HAVE LIVED IN THIS AREA
 FOR 13 YEARS. THE HOUSE WAS IN VERY   
 BAD CONDITION AND THEY HAVE IMPROVED  
 IT AND BUILT AN EXTENSION. THE        
 CEILINGS ARE VERY LOW AS THE HOUSE IS 
 VERY OLD. THE LOFT IS NOW ONE BIG ROOM
 AND THERE ARE 4 BEDROOMS IN ALL.      </content>
