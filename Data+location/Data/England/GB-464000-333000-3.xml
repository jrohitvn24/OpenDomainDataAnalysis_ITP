		<content> Mrs Hardy and Mrs Beaumount came in to
 tell us what Cotgrave was like.Church 
 Lane was called Pepper Street in the  
 olden days because in those days they 
 didn't bury  people very deep,so it   
 smelt and the people that went past   
 took a handkerchief with pepper in and
 that is why it is called Pepper       
 Street.They had toilets which were a  
 wooden seat and a hole and a pan at   
 the bottom.They also danced round the 
 maypole in the Rector's garden and    
 they had flower shows.  We had to go  
 to Bingham to do the baking and they  
 used shells to count with.The school  
 had two playgrounds one for the boys  
 and one for the girls.In the first    
 class you wrote on sand ,in the next  
 class you wrote on slate and in the   
 top class you wrote on paper.They had 
 a sports day as well.                 
                                       </content>
