		<content>    Mr.Farley has owned the Royal Oak  
 for 20 years.He has the pub records   
 going back to 1643.                   
    The pub used to be a training      
 centre for young soldiers.A famous    
 General Patton used to drink in the   
 pub.One year Mr.Farley found a        
 wheelbarrow full of cartridge shells  
 in his garden.                        
    He enjoys running the pub and does 
 not mind working when everyone else is
 working as he gets more money.        
    He gets up at 7o'clock every       
 morning and works 80 hours a week.He  
 does not get much spare time.         
    Most of his regulars buy him a     
 drink and he never has any trouble    
 from people where the Police are      
 concerned.
