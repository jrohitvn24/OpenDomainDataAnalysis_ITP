		<content>{   THE CHURCH OF ST. EDBURGA, LEIGH } 
      The parish church is dedicated to
 St. Edburga, a Saxon princess and     
 grand-daughter of Alfred the Great,   
 who is buried at Worcester Cathedral. 
 It is originally a 12th century       
 building on the site of an earlier    
 Saxon church.                         
                                       
      The church's particular treasure 
 is the figure of Christ in Blessing,  
 dating from 1220, which is now housed 
 on the east wall of the restored Mary 
 of Magdala Chapel. Other noteworthy   
 features are the Norman pillars, made 
 of Cradley stone, forming an arcade   
 between the nave and Bransford Aisle; 
 the Jacobean altar rails; tombs dating
 from the 17th century and the remains 
 of the medieval rood screen. Most of  
 the stained glass is Victorian.
