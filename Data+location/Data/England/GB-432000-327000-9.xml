		<title>09ANCHOR CHURCH</title>
		<content> Anchor church is not really a church, 
 but a cave in the Bunter sandstone    
 just along the river from Ingleby     
 villge.                               
 It is called a church because at some 
 time in the past an anchorite or      
 hermit lived there and shaped holes in
 the rock to look like church windows. 
 Anchorites were people who for        
 religious reasons chose to live alone 
 often in remote places.               
 No-one is sure of the date when it was
 first called Anchor Church but in the 
 records of 1658 there is an entry     
 which tells of a burial at Anchor     
 Church of "ye foole of Anchor Church".
