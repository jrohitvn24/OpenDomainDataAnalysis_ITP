		<title>08Farnham Town Boys F.C.</title>
		<content>    Farnham Town is the really big team
 in this area. There are lots of       
 different leagues in this area and the
 under 13's belong to the{West Surrey }
 league. The youngest age group are the
 under 9's,and from that age group it  
 goes up to the under 16's. There is a 
{youth team}and a men's team as well. I
 belong to the under13's. I joined     
 about three months ago from another   
 team. Last season the under 13's came 
 third in the league,out of about 15   
 other teams. The colour of the kit is 
{charet, blue and white.}The teams     
 are managed by mainly Dads of boys at 
 Farnham Town. The managers do not get 
 paid at all.
