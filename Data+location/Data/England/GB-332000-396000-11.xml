		<content>   The landscape in our area is typical
 of many coastal plains, as a result of
 industrialisation and the growth of a 
 major port it has become densely      
 populated. The land does not rise over
 50 feet above sea level,the skyline   
 being broken by pylons, factories,    
 blocks of flats and dockland with     
 recently constructed roadways and     
 flyovers, giving the view of modern   
 development.                          
  In the south the landscape is more   
 intensely covered with office         
 buildings,intermingled with private   
 dwellings,while the north east and    
 western sections have more open spaces
 ie.playing fields,allotments,a golf   
 course and a brook which for most part
 runs underground.It is bordered to the
 east by the Leeds and Liverpool Canal.
 Buildings of note are Walton Prison,  
 National Giro and Crosby Town Hall.   </content>
