A quarter of the people questioned     
wished that Daventry had either a      
Marks and Spencer or Woolworths (as    
Northampton and Rugby have).It should  
be noted that 64% (nearly 2/3) could   
not think of any shops which were      
missing in Daventry.This is a          
reflection of the general satisfaction 
expressed in question one.             
 People came shopping to Daventry from 
 as far away as Milton Keynes (nearly  
30 miles),though 3/4 of those          
questioned actually live in Daventry   
and 95% of shoppers live closer than 10
miles from Daventry.This suggests that 
the Daventry shopping centre is not    
attracting many people from long       
distances like Northampton or Milton   
Keynes does for example.
