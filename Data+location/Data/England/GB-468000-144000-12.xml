		<content> Church Fete: Held annually in July in 
 one of the gardens in the village in  
 aid of church funds. Stalls and side- 
 shows all run by the local inhabitants
 and raise some Â£800 to Â£1000.         
 Fund Raising: Coffee mornings and     
 Bring and Buy Sales have been held in 
 aid of the Village Hall and various   
 charities, and there are a number of  
 house to house collections.           
 Most houses have telephones on the    
 Long Sutton exchange but it is planned
 to incorporate this into the main     
 Basingstoke exchange in 1986. No Post 
 office in the block, nearest at South 
 Warnborough but one shortly to be re- 
 opened at Upton Grey. Post collections
 at Weston Patrick 6am and 4pm except  
 Saturday afternoon and Sundays. Postal
 deliveries about 6.30am and 3pm.
