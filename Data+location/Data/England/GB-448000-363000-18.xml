		<content> Of the older senior citizens          
 questioned on the changes the main    
 change from the second world war to   
 the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II  
 was thought to be the increase in the 
 cost of living.The main changes from  
 the coronation to the present day are 
 the large numbers of houses that have 
 been built, also more older people    
 than there were thirty years ago,they 
 said that people seemed to be living  
 quite a bit longer than they used to  
 do. Into their eighties, nineties and 
 even hundreds. They said it was partly
 because of better food and medical    
 attention. The modern day of living   
 had changed over the years and that   
 televison had a big influence on      
 people's lives and not for the better.
 Older people thought that shopping    
 facilities had worsened, violence and 
 drug addiction now more common.       </content>
