		<content> The farms in our area are mostly{mixed
 farms i.e.they grow crops and rear    
 beasts.At Thorney Close farm the      
 owner had to take down the hedges and 
 fences so that he could get the       
 combined harvester into the fields.The
 land is{arable}that means it is fit   
 for ploughing.The farms are generally 
 from 100 to l50 acres in size. At     
 Thorney Close farm,Mr Kennedy the     
 farmer grows barley,wheat and rape.He 
 keeps cows,sheep and chickens but he  
 only keeps cows for beef.Milk         
 production is very time demanding and 
 he has been{farming}for forty         
 years.The farmers grow barley because 
 it brings a lot of money at market.The
 barley in our area is mainly used for 
 brewing beer.
