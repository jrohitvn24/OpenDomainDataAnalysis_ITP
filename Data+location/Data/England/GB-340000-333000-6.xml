		<content> The water for the canal comes from    
 Chainbridge in Llangollen out of the  
 River Dee and the canal is filled     
 through a meter house.So that the     
 water will not drain away the people  
 that made the canal put puddled clay  
 on the bottom.The British Waterways   
 first maintained the canal.There was a
 burst near by about ten years ago and 
 the water from the canal covered lots 
 of the farmers  fields.The {Shropshire
{Union canal}runs from Llangollen to   
 Hurlston.The craft that use the canal 
 are Narrow Boats.Coal and lime used to
 be brought along the canal,and the    
 lime was burnt in the lime kilns in   
 Welshampton and was also used as      
 fertilizer on the nearby farms.The    
 people of Ellesmere and Salop thought 
 that building the canal would be a    
 quick and sure way of making money.
