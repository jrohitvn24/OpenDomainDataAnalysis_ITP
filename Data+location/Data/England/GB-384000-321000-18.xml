		<title>18Mrs Hazeldine of Ranton (II)</title>
		<content>                                       
Mrs Hazeldine is now a widow. Mr Hazel-
dine  died  of a stroke in  1982.  They
used  to  breed donkeys  but  when  her
husband died Mrs Hazeldine sold all the
animals except one.                    
Mrs  Hazeldine doesn't go to market  at
all  now because she has  retired  from
farming.  She  isn't a  member  of  any
village  societies but she does  go  to
church.                                
When  the Hazeldines came to Ranton  34
years  ago there was no  sanitation  or
electricity. The present house that Mrs
Hazeldine lives in was build about 1780
but a lot has been extended and modern-
ised. The farm wasn't passed down      
through generations of her family.  The
house has four bedrooms and there is  a
view of Stafford Castle. Mrs  Hazeldine
just  does ordinary domestic jobs  such
as housework, cooking and gardening.   </content>
