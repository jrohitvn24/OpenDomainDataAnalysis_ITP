		<content>The area consists largely of the Medway
estuary and its tidal creeks and       
marshes.The main shore line of the     
estuary runs from north west to south  
east along the southern edge of the    
block. Motney Hill and Horrid Hill are 
two peninsulas jutting northwards into 
Bartlett Creek, one of the arms of the 
estuary.Otterham Creek is an important 
inlet providing tidal small port       
facilities. The block also contains    
much of Nore Marsh,a series of islands 
and saltings in the estuary itself.    
Nore Marsh can just be reached on foot 
by causeway at low tide and was used   
for grazing until 1950. The highest    
point in the area is Motney Hill which 
rises 15m above sea level.Everywhere   
else is very low-lying and liable to   
flooding. Land quality has been        
extensively damaged by salination      
resulting from heavy flooding in 1963. </content>
