		<title>09  Motney Hill saltings</title>
		<content>On the western side of the Motney Hill 
peninsula is a crescent shaped area of 
low-lying recently deposited land It is
a salt marsh or salting. It consists   
of hardened estuarine mud up to 1m     
above high water level dissected       
by numerous winding channels. These    
channels vary in width and are         
irrgular in pattern. They are filled   
with water at high tide and they are   
floored with very fine soft mud.The    
higher drier sections of the marsh     
which have an extensive plant cover    
are much firmer under foot. Around the 
margins of the  marsh is a quite       
distinct beach. It is separated from   
the marsh by a hardened clay "micro    
cliff" and is composed of courser      
sandy material than are the tidal      
deposits within the marsh. This area of
saltings is typical of many on the     
Medway estuary.                        </content>
