		<title>13MY HOUSE</title>
		<content>   My house is on the border between   
 Lancashire and Yorkshire,between Colne
 and Lothersdale.Our house has 17      
 rooms.                                
   Three years ago we had an extension 
 built,but as we have a wood which     
 blocks out the sunlight behind our    
 house,our lounge is upstairs.Our      
 lounge is 22ft. by 18ft.In the games  
 room which is above the garage,there  
 is a snooker table and a dart-board.  
 The bedrooms and bathroom are         
 downstairs.In the older part a glass  
 door has a heron which has been       
 sand-blasted into the glass.In the    
 dining-room round the solid oak table 
 are red-leather chairs with brass     
 studs round the edges.Our kitchen is  
 large with numerous cupboards.
