		<content> On{Yeldersley Lane}is the{Hole In The 
{Wall.}It used to be a{Toll House}.In  
 main arch there are blocked up windows
 where they paid their tax to get to   
{Bradley Park.}The roof in the arch has
 been made from wattle and daub with   
 strips of wood across.On either side  
 of the building are the hooks where   
 the gates used to be hung,they opened 
 them when the people paid.On the      
 outside of the building are small     
 windows which are partly made of      
 lead.The semi detached houses are now 
 private dwellings.
