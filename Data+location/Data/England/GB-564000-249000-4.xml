		<content> Parents are very supportive and       
 problems are rare, being              
 sympathetically dealt with by the     
 staff. Parents raise funds for the    
 school by way of the Thurlow District 
 Village Schools Association, filling  
 the gap left by government spending   
 cuts. Mothers help with the swimming  
 rota and a father teaches football.   
 The vicar introduces children to the  
 church by holding the weekly stone    
 wood and brass rubbing lessons there. 
 A luncheon club for th elderly meets  
 at school once a month. Children      
 decorate the tables with flowers,     
 greet their guests and take their     
 coats, remember birthdays with songs  
 and cards and most visitors then stay 
 for afternoon school. School and WI   
 together present the village Christmas
 concert and a yearly fete is held.    
 Children go on to Parkway Middle.     </content>
