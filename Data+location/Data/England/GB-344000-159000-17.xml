{Entertainment.}Our area does  not have
 many entertainments so we make our    
 own. Churchill Primary School Fete,   
 Burrington Church Fete, and Langford  
 Church Fete. For the children there   
 are two small playgrounds with        
 swings, slides, and a wooden castle.  
 There are playing fields for public   
 use. There is a Sports Centre in the  
 nearby comprehensive school. At       
 Burrington and Churchill there is a   
 bell ringing and choir practice, once 
 a week. The Womans Institute meets    
 once a month. There are skittles and  
 darts matches. For the children, there
 are Scouts, Brownies, Guides, and Cubs
 once a week. Many people enjoy going  
 to the pub for a drink and a chat.
