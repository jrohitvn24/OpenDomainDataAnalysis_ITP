		<title>19GOLDHANGER - THE NAME</title>
		<content> The name "Goldhanger" has been spelt  
 "Goldangre","Goldangra" and           
 "Goldanger" before the present        
 spelling,"Goldhanger".                
 The "gold" part in the name           
 Goldhanger" which is present in all   
 the spellings comes from a flower -   
 the corn marigold.It was used to cure 
 diseases such as smallpox and measels 
 but it was becoming a serious pest by 
 the 12th century and so Henry II      
 issued an ordinance against it.       
 The "anger" part means either a hill  
 or a grassland and since it is a flat 
 area a grassland is more likely.      
 Nearby towns and villages such as     
 Ongar and Chipping Ongar are probably 
 also related to a grassland like      
 Goldhanger.
