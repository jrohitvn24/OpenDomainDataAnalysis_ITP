		<content>    Another farm in the block is 300   
 acres. In 1985, 177 acres were under  
 wheat, 42 under barley, 42 under      
 oil-seed rape, and 16 were under peas 
 for freezing. The farm also had one   
 and a half acres of woodland, planted 
 for foxes and pheasants in the late   
 18th century. The farm is worked by   
 the farm owner, with occasional help  
 from his son, and one other man at    
 harvest. This means a large investment
 in machinery, and extensive use of    
 chemical pest- and herbicides. This   
 farm also has a grain drier, built in 
 1961. Some heifers and calves are     
 kept. They graze outside in the       
 summer, and are sold as stores for    
 fattening in the autumn. In the past, 
 store-cattle have been bought in, kept
 in the crew-yard, and fed on hay and  
 rolled barley until weight and market 
 prices were right.                    </content>
