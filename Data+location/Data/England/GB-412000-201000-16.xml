		<title>16MR. RADWAY, THE BAKER.</title>
		<content>  {Mr. Radway}is a hard working man,   
 who works 7 days a week.   He starts  
 work at 4 in the morning during week  
 days but at weekends he works from l  
 a.m. because more people require his  
 bakery products.   At night he makes  
 his bread dough so that it is ready to
 bake the next morning.   He started as
 a baker in the Second World War.   Mr.
 Radway does not enjoy baking quite    
 like he used to because of his bad    
 legs.    As a baker he is so          
 experienced that he does not need to  
 weigh out quantities of mixed fruit   
 for cakes but can judge them by sight.
 Mr. Radway was once a keen and capable
 local cricketer and now enjoys        
 watching the game on television.
