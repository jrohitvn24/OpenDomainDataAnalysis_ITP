       There are three terms in the    
 school year. The Autumn term begins in
 September and ends in December;       
 January to late March or early April  
 is the Spring term; Summer term is    
 from April to July.                   
       Some of the main events in the  
 school's calendar are its Harvest     
 Festival in October, Christmas        
 Activities, Decorated Easter Egg      
 Competition, Sports Day and annual    
 Summer Concerts.                      
       Every opportunity is taken to   
 welcome parents and visitors into     
 school, to help and join in with some 
 of the work that is being done.
