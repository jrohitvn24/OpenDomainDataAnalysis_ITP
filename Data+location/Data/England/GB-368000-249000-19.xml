		<content> The only place of worship in the area 
 is Stanford Bishop church. This is a  
 small late Norman church situated in a
 large churchyard with many old yew    
 trees. The church stands on a hill,   
 the highest point in the parish, it   
 has no houses near it being almost    
 surrounded by blackcurrants and hops. 
 The churchyard is circular which is   
 thought to indicate pre-Christian use 
 as a sacred site. In the church is an 
 old chair thought to have been used   
 by St.Augustine when he met Welsh     
 bishops in 603 at Stanford Bishop. To 
 test him the Welsh bishops arranged   
 for Augustine to arrive first and be  
 seated in the chair. As he did not    
 rise to greet them they distrusted him
 and returned home.   Experts doubt    
 whether this meeting was held at      
 Stanford Bishop or that the chair was 
 made earlier than the late middle ages</content>
