		<title>07KING GEORGE V1 PARK</title>
		<content> What is now King George V1 park used  
 to be the gardens of Sir Moses        
 Montefiore's mansion called East Cliff
 Lodge.When he bought the mansion and  
 grounds covering some 24 acres in 1831
 it only cost him Â£5,500!It is made of 
 brick with a stucco finish and slated 
 roof in the Gothic style with         
 castellated towers.In the gardens is  
 an Italianate conservatory of         
 architectural and historic interest.  
 Built in the 18th century it is a     
 delicate cast and wrought iron        
 structure with small scalloped panes  
 and an iron entrance porch.It was     
 reopened after restoration in 1981.The
 park is now used for walking the      
 dog,picnics and playing in the area   
 with climbing frames,swings and a     
 slide.The gardens have seats and a    
 kiosk for refreshments.The park       
 overlooks the Channel-France if fine! </content>
