		<content> The village and districts round about 
 elect a{Parish Council}which meets    
 every 6 weeks in the school to discuss
 and make recommendations to the{Ribble
{Valley Borough Council}in Clitheroe   
 which is much bigger and is           
 responsible for planning permission,  
 roads,the fire service and has an     
 interest in education. The control    
 over planning permission for housing  
 at local level has meant that new     
 housing is rarely allowed in the area.
 The{Parochial Church Council}meets    
 regularly to discuss the running and  
 finance of the church.                
 The{Governors of the school}are local 
 people who are responsible for the    
 upkeep of the school buildings and the
 welfare of the pupils.The school is   
 financed by the{County Council}at     
 Preston and overseen by local district
 offices in Clitheroe and Accrington.  </content>
