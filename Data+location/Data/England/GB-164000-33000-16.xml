		<title>16FARMING GENERAL OUTLINE</title>
		<content> The land in the area is mostly{grass- 
{land,}with a small percentage of      
 moorland, both of which are used for  
 grazing. The majority of farms are    
 dairy with few mixed or arable farms. 
 Most dairy farms cover about 20 acres 
 with 10-60 cows and have milking      
 parlours able to deal with about 6    
 cows at a time. One exception is a    
 farm covering 176 acres (an area      
 previously farmed by 12 families)     
 with 130 cows and a{computerised      
{milking parlour}for 16 cows. There is 
 a mixed farm with poultry and flowers 
 but the land is not suitable for large
 scale market garden crops and most    
 crops are grown for animal feed. These
 include: wheat, barley, stubble       
 turnips and kale. There is a stud     
 farm specializing in{rare stallions,}a
 pig farm, one small nursery and many  
 small-holdings.                       </content>
