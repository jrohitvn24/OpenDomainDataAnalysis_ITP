		<content> An interview with two elderly         
 residents of Gosmore,Mr &amp; Mrs Fagg,   
 revealed the following{changes within 
{living memory:                        
 "The Priory Way area was a pea field  
 on the edge of Priory Park.           
 "Before the 2nd World War,a small cul 
 de sac was developed and this is now  
 the other end of Priory Way,near the  
 letter box.                           
 "In 1948,the pea field was sold and   
 the road laid down and from 1949 to   
 about 1955 the houses were built.     
 "At about the same time,Dale Close was
 developed and shortly afterwards,the  
 Silent Order of Nuns who lived in a   
 large house on the land between Dale  
 Close and Newlands Lane was sold and  
 the nuns moved away.This area was then
 also developed."                      
                      (contd.)
