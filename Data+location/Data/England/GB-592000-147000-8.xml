 Helen and Janet interviewed Miss      
Ruglys about the changes that have     
taken place in Charing. Miss Ruglys    
used to be the deputy head of Charing  
School and has lived in Charing all her
life.                                  
 In Miss Ruglys's view Charing has     
changed for the better. The roads have 
been tarmaced so they are smooth. Cars 
have been invented, which is for the   
better because it means people can     
get about more easily. But one problem 
with cars is that they are noisy and   
clutter up the streets. This is        
especially so in Charing with its      
narrow High Street.                    
  The Village has got bigger which     
Miss Ruglys feels is for the worse     
because Charing used to be a friendly  
Village but now its hard to get to know
everybody.                             </content>
