		<content>   In June 1985 a group of 9-11 year   
 old children visited an{adventure     
{centre at Pwll Du,near Blaenavon,}in  
 Gwent.                                
   Activities started with a visit to  
{Raglan Castle.}Defences have existed  
 here since the 11th century.          
   The Adventure Centre is situated on 
 old{open cast mine workings}which     
 provide interesting study and         
 walks.Further walking was done in the 
{Brecon Beacons}beside rivers and      
 waterfalls.                           
   Other activities included{canoeing, 
{pony-trekking,shooting and abseiling. 
 A highlight was the descent of a{40   
{metre mine shaft}by abseiling.        
   On the last day a visit was made to 
 the{Big Pit}coal mine at Blaenavon.The
 pit ceased production in 1980 and is  
 kept as a{Museum}now.
