		<title>15HOUSING IN BURGHFIELD</title>
		<content> The Average house in Burghfield has   
 four bedrooms, a kitchen, a dining    
 room and lounge.  The lounge has      
 usually a television, a record player 
 and furniture for sitting on.  The    
 bedrooms consist of one big one, one  
 quite big one and two small bedrooms. 
 The big bedroom is usually for adults.
  The next size is normally the spare  
 bedroom for visitors and the two small
 rooms would probably be for the       
 children.  The dining room in the     
 house is joined onto the lounge or it 
 is seperate from the lounge.  The     
 kitchen in the house can be small or  
 large and contains a sink, units, a   
 cooker and a fridge.  The houses also 
 have a front and back garden.  The    
 back garden is usually bigger than the
 front garden.
