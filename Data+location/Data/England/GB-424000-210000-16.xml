		<content>One of the games we play is called     
Budge,a very long game.The most people 
who can play are five.You all stand on 
something and if someone hasn't got    
anything they go up to another player  
and sayÂ£Budge'and then try and catch   
them.We also play Duck,duck,goose,where
you sit in a circle.someone walks round
saying Â£Duck,duck.'When they say'goose'
you try and catch them.If you do they  
go in the cooking pot in the middle.In 
the paddock we play Â£Go spells go'.When
this is said,everybody does a handstand
and the longest up says it again.We    
also play Â£It's cold under the apple   
tree' which is a skipping game.The     
boys  mostly play football,and         
marbles,and conkers in season.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
