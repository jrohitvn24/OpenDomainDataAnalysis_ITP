     Some of the villages think that   
 there should be more recreation for   
 children. Others think that the dog   
 handling classes as the play group for
 hygene reasons.                       
                                       
     Some of the customs in Ebberston  
 include tieing the gates at church    
 wedding and not undoimg them until    
 money is thrown a you by people at the
 wedding. You are supposed to fall in  
 the beck before you become a true     
 Ebberstonian, but this does not count 
 unless you were born in the village to
 strt with. Rolling eggs down a certain
 hill at Easter is another custom.
