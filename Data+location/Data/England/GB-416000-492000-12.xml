		<title>12Employment in Hunton</title>
		<content>   Very few people who  live  in Hunton
 actually work here.  The  shop and two
 pubs  are{small family businesses, }as
 is  the dairy  which provides work for
 two men.  Two others also deliver milk
 to surrounding villages.  We see{local
{farmers}about during the day  or maybe
 the{Police Constable }who is stationed
 in Hunton.  One couple  makes knitwear
 in their home and a gentleman produces
 jewellery. The  local builder  employs
 several villagers,but other labourers,
 joiners and carpenters work away.  The
 two Sadlers have  a{repair garage }and
 operate {taxis }in nearby towns. A few
 residents do{part-time jobs}near home.
 Ladies machine knit,  are cleaners  or
 volunteer for Meals on Wheels eaten by
 some of the{55 retired people}here,but
{all others in full employment commute,
 civil servants,soldiers,teachers, shop
 assistants,reps, nurses,firemen etc.  </content>
