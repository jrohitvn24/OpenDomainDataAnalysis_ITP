		<content> This Roman Catholic Church was built  
 by{Alexander Raphael}in 1846.  He was 
 a{Member of Parliament}for the        
 Surbiton Park Estate.  The building is
 of an ornate Italian style and its    
 grounds are used for fairs.  Members  
 of the{French Royal Family}were       
 married in this church.  In 1895 the {
{Prince of Wales,}later{King Edward VII
 attended a wedding there.  There is a 
 story that tells of how a fortune     
 teller told Alexander that he would   
 die two months after the Church was   
 consecrated.  He managed to put off   
 this event three times but two months 
 after the eventual consecration       
 Alexander did die!
