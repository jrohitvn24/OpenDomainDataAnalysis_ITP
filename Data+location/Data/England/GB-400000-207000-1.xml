		<title>01THE NORTH CERNEY AREA</title>
		<content>  Our block lies in the Cotswolds on   
 either side of the main A435          
 Cirencester - Cheltenham road. The    
 road follows the valley of the River  
 Churn which is the main geographical  
 feature of the block. To the east, the
 land rises to North Cerney Downs which
 are about 200 metres above sea level. 
 To the west, the land rises to a      
 narrow plateau and then drops steeply 
 towards the Cirencester - Gloucester  
 road (A417 - the Roman Ermine Street).
 The valley itself is used for rough   
 grazing since the sides are too steep 
 and the valley bottom too wet for     
 anything else. The Downs are used for 
 growing cereal crops. There are three 
 small villages: North Cerney, Rendcomb
 and Woodmancote, mostly built of      
 Cotswold stone . There is a big chain 
 of pylons going north/south across our
 block carrying electricity cables.    </content>
