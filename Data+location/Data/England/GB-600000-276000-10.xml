		<content>With no schools in the block, children 
must travel to school. Primary schools 
are in adjoining villages of Hopton and
Rickinghall. To attend middle school   
the children travel on average approx. 
7 miles to Stanton, on a school bus    
supplied by the County Council. The    
Upper School is at Thurston, which is  
a bus journey of approx.15 miles. For  
further education there is a college at
Bury St. Edmunds which has a limited   
range of vocational courses as well as 
G.C.E. 'O' &amp; 'A' level courses for more
mature students. The technical college 
at Ipswich has a wider choice of       
courses. Some evening classes are run  
by the Education Dept. of the County   
Council, a few at Hopton school, at    
Walsham-Le-Willows, and at Ixworth with
a wider choice at Bury St. Edmunds.
