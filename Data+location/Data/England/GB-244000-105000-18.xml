		<content> There are about 20 widely scattered   
 farms in the block; half are under    
 100 acres. Half are dairy farms, the  
 rest keeping sheep, pigs and beef     
 cattle. The largest,with 750 acres, is
 exclusively devoted to corn. Most have
 remained unchanged in their field     
 layout for many years, though the     
 largest has removed a number of hedges
 for greater efficiency.About half have
 replaced or added to farm buildings in
 recent years and all own tractors and 
 modern machinery. Several have small  
 areas of established woodland, with   
 oak, ash, beech, sycamore and hazel,  
 and 2 have newly planted areas of     
 broad-leafed trees. One farmhouse     
 includes a carved church beam and a   
 wall plaque dated 1708 while another  
 stands on the site of a monastery.    
 About half the farmers expect their   
 sons to run the farm when they retire.</content>
