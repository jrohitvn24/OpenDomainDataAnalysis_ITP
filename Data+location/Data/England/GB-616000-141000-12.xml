		<content>   Mr.Snow is a shepherd at Standard   
 Hill Farm; he looks after 900         
 sheep.The sheep year begins in the    
 Autumn when the Rams are put in with  
 the Ewes.It is important that the     
 sheep have good grazing at this time  
 of the year to keep them in good      
 condition.By the beginning of January 
 half the Ewes are yarded under cover  
 with straw bedding that is littered   
 daily.They are now fed a ration of    
 concentrates,crushed oats, barley,    
 protein pellets and minerals and as   
 much hay as they need.                
   At the 12th of March the Lambing    
 season begins. The next job is to ring
 the new lambs and number them so that 
 if a lamb gets lost you can always    
 find its mother. About 700 out of 900 
 have twins.
