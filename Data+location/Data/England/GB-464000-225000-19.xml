		<title>19Housing in Twyford Area</title>
		<content> The majority of houses in the area are
 of red brick reflecting the local     
 industry.Only 5 thatched cottages     
 remain in Twyford.Nearly all the      
 houses have a garden.A sad sign of the
 times is that as older inhabitants    
 die,mature properties  are being      
 modernised at the expense of          
 character.The few new properties are  
 tending to be larger,family homes and 
 this trend is changing the nature of  
 the population.Rented accomodation is 
 declining as council properties are   
 being purchased by their tenants under
 a government scheme.Consequently the  
 "council look" is being lost as houses
 are improved and altered to suit      
 individual needs and tastes.The large 
 Mnanor house at Poundon is still used 
 as a family home whereas Twyford Manor
 is now converted into flats.Twyford   
 Grange is now an Old People's Home.   </content>
