		<title>09Burscough-Work on a Farm</title>
		<content>by Barbara                             
 Being only 14 I can't yet drive on    
the road,but I would like to take my   
tractor test when I am 16.I drive most 
things around the farm and I drive the 
tractors and trailers in the field     
whilst the combine empties its tank.On 
A good night we can stay combining     
till past midnight and I often get the 
job of making the the mens baggin.I    
usually give them a flask of           
tea,sandwiches and an apple/crisps.    
This year we started harvesting later  
than most years because of all the wet 
and cold weather.So now even though I  
am back to school I spend most of my   
free time working.Last Sunday was a    
fine,dry day so we went combining even 
though we were very short staffed.
