		<title>13Footpaths.</title>
		<content> To tell you there are footpaths       
 between{Colburn}and{Easby Abbey},wide 
 yellow arrows are painted on to gate- 
 posts,trees or wooden stiles.Paths in 
 the field are hard to spot because    
 they've not been used a lot and are   
 overgrown with grass and nettles.Most 
 stiles are in good condition but some 
 are broken:snapped because of weather,
 vandalism or neglect.When the path    
 enters the woods,it isn't easy to     
 see.It's muddy and there are ditches  
 and boggy patches you have to jump    
 across,though there is a wooden       
 bridge over one stream.You cross some 
 muddy parts on slippery stones and    
 fallen trees,and in places branches   
 have grown across the path.A gravel   
 path from the{Iron Bridge}to the{Baths
 in{Richmond}is wide and straight:it   
 used to be a railway line.
