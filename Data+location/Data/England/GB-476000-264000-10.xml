		<title>10CAREY BAPTIST CHURCH (cont)</title>
		<content>On October 2nd, 1792 the Baptist       
Missionary Society was founded at      
Kettering, and Carey voulenteered to go
to India. The first few months were    
full of difficulties. At last he met an
English Cristian in the village. Now   
self supporting he was able to preach  
in the villages. On March 5th, 1801    
Carey laid on the Communion Table the  
very first copy of the Bengali Bible.  
Now in Carey Baptist Church there is a 
museum in memory of Carey. Many people 
go to the church, the Minister is      
Stuart Jenkins. He comes to the school 
sometimes.                             
The Baptist community in Moulton dates 
 from the middle opf the 17th century. 
A John Clown moved in 1652 and began to
hold meetings in a cottage. Todays     
building is in West Street.
