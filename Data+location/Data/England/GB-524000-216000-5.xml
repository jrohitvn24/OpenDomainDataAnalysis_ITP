 We went to Mardleybury farm. The      
 farmer,{Mr Sapsed,}owns 500 acres of  
 land. Two_thirds of his farm is used  
 for cereals, the rest is for livestock
 grazing.He employs one person         
 full-time and one person part-time to 
 work on the farm.                     
 On his land he keeps beef cattle,     
 which have won him more than{2,000    
{rosettes.}Half of Mr Sapsed's animals 
 go to the slaughter house. He takes   
 his cattle to Hertford Cattle Market  
 every year.Mr Sapsed was the President
 of the Hertford Cattle Society        
 (White-faced).He grows wheat and      
 barley,but he also buys in food for   
 his cattle.On his farm he uses:       
 tractors, cultivators, drills, and he 
 has his own combine harvester.
