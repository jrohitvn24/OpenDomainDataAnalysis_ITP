		<title>10The closure of William Penn</title>
		<content>  The closure of William Penn school   
 has been a great blow,but in our area 
 a school had to go and William Penn   
 was chosen.The Secretary of State,Sir 
 Keith Joseph decided that it was not  
 worth having 3 schools in the Watford 
 area for such a small amount of       
 children so William Penn went.200 of  
 William Penn's pupils will go to John 
 Penrose in Middlesex and others will  
 go to Durrants and a handful will go  
 to other schools around the area such 
 as Rickmansworth school.Children who  
 are in 4th year at primary school who 
 have brothers and sisters in William  
 Penn would go to the school the       
 brothers or sisters chose to go to.   
  When William Penn closes there will  
 not be a job loss because the council 
 has to find jobs for all those in the 
 school unless they decide to take     
 retirement.                           </content>
