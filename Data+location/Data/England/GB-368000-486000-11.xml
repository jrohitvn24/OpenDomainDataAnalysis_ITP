		<title>11The Cobbled Street Of Dent.</title>
		<content> The original main street was probably 
 laid before the Norman Church was     
 built,it is mentioned in the Domesday 
 Book of 1086.Dent was a big market    
 town where people came to trade their 
 wares such as livestock of all kinds, 
 wool,knitting,food produce etc.The    
 Main Street was always a hive of      
 activity with knitters sitting busily 
 knitting in the "knitting galleries"  
 which have been taken down to make    
 room for milk container vehicles,     
 tractors and the like.George Fox,the  
 founder of The Society Of Friends,    
 preached at the market cross, which   
 has also gone now.There are still     
 remains of the horse troughs and the  
 horse mounts on the cobbled street.   
   The houses lining the streets are   
 all stone built and about three or    
 four hundred years old.The actual     
 cobbles are the original ones.        </content>
