		<title>11THE COMMUNITY OF HORWICH (2)</title>
		<content>    At least the Metropolitan Borough, 
 through its planning department, had a
 close look at the old town centre of  
 Horwich near the Crown. They have     
 tried to limit housing development on 
 the fringes of the countryside and    
 done everything to encourage new      
 housing in the vacant sites of the    
 centre.                               
    In addition, these new housing     
 units are of a varied, reasonably     
 cheaply built type, aiming to meet the
 needs of local people. The centre is  
 coming alive again.                   
    Issues which Horwich still needs to
 consider are the problem of traffic   
 flow on Lee Lane, the provision of a  
 wide range of smart shops and above   
 all the employment of young people    
 whose lives markedly changed when the 
 kernel of the old Horwich, the        
 Locomotive Works, closed in 1984.     </content>
