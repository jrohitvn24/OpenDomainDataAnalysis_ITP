		<title>07Bishops Woods History</title>
		<content> By M. Dickson                         
 This site was once covered by the     
 ancient extensive{Feckenham Forest.   
 It's name until about 1838 was        
{Lineholt Wood}but this had changed by 
 the begining of the present century to
{Bishops Wood}maybe because of         
 episcopal  associations. The manner of
 Hartlebury is included in the Domesday
 Book among lands belonging to the see 
 of Worcester and for much of the time 
 thereafter the wood was probably part 
 of the manor.Bishops of Worcester held
 free warren of the manor from 1255 and
 it is likely that the wood was hunted 
 by them for game. The wood itself is  
 now one corner of the old Wyre Forest,
 isolated, as most of the land around  
 has been cleared. The woodland nowe   
 has to be 'managed';if it was simply  
 left to run wild it would be          
 completely inaccessible.              </content>
