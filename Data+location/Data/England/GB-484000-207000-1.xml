		<title>01The Appeal of Wendover</title>
		<content>                                       
Wendover is a fair sized village at    
the foot of the Chiltern Hills. It is  
on the main road from Aylesbury to     
London, although a bypass is to be     
built in 1988. There are lovely places 
to walk including Coombe Hill, from    
where you can clearly see Wendover     
and the beechy Halton Woods. The       
famous Ridgeway Path runs through the  
village  centre. A visit to the        
Tourist Information Office in the      
Clock Tower would be a good idea.      
There are lots of places to eat and    
drink and plenty of amenities and      
clubs. There are quite a few churches  
in Wendover, the oldest being the      
Parish Church of St.Mary. Wendover is  
 quite an advanced village, although   
shopping is fairly limited.
