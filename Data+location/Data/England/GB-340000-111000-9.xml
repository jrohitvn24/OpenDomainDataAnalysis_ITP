		<content> School finishes at three fifteen      
 and we put up the chairs on the tables
 and say a prayer. Then go and get our 
 coats and bags and line up outside by 
 the gate. My dad or Mr Perry picks us 
 up alternately week after week and    
 drives us home in a car. At home I do 
 lots of things like fishing, playing  
 on my BMX bike or tennis and sometimes
 I watch TV. I normally watch some     
 black and white films. At home we are 
 all together. We have 12 ducks, about 
 3 chickens, 1 cockerel, and 1         
 nannygoat and we put them in their    
 pens for the night at about 5 o'      
 clock. It is my job to feed them.     
 They have corn and bread. At about    
 5,30 I go in for tea.
