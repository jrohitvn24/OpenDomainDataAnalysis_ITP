		<title>15BRIGHTON ROCK.</title>
		<content> In 1938 the novelist Graham Greene    
 wrote a book, which characterised     
 one side of life in Brighton at the   
 time. Greene had visited Brighton     
 many times - during the period of     
 poverty and depression preceding World
 War II. Unemployment was at 5% or a   
 total of 5,000 in the town.There were 
 street fights between the Fascists and
 the unemployed, throughout these hard 
 times.The violence rate in Brighton   
 was also high associated frequently   
 with the viciousness of the           
 race-course as gangs offered          
 "protection" to bookmakers and        
 took their vengeance with razors or   
 blackmail.                            
   The opening sentence of the book    
 begins with Hale, a newspaper         
 journalist..."Hale knew they meant to 
 murder him before he had been in      
 Brighton three hours...."             </content>
