		<title>15INTERVIEW WITH SINGLE PARENT</title>
		<content>  This single parent is a 26 year old  
 woman living in Birkdale.She said that
 although she had difficulty in        
 supporting herself and her child      
 immediately after her husband left    
 her,she manages better now.She goes   
 out to work and her mother looks after
 her child because she cannot afford a 
 childminder.She counts herself lucky  
 to have a job but dislikes her        
 employer.She works as a secretary and 
 has been passed over for promotion    
 several times whilst the men have     
 always been promoted.She dislikes     
 being asked if she has children       
 because when she says yes she can see 
 prospective employers mentally        
 dismissing her,even in this supposed  
 age of equality.She hates this        
 attitude;even though she has a child  
 she knows she would be good enough for
 the job but is never given a chance.  </content>
