		<title>13Wendover Clubs And Pastimes</title>
		<content>Wendover residents enjoy a wide range  
of organised activities including      
Squash, Tennis and Swimming Clubs which
are popular with all ages.             
 The Wendover Society is well          
supported and acts as a political      
spokesman concerned with the quality   
of life and changes within the         
village. The Mothers Club and British  
Legion are well attended and for       
children there are several thriving    
Cubs, Scouts, Brownies and Guide packs 
besides dancing classes, Junior        
football and gymnastics clubs.         
Walking, swimming and sporting         
pursuits are the most popular family   
activities mentioned by Wendover       
residents but D.I.Y and gardening      
feature as important pastimes.         
Recently the village has been          
especially concerned with the effects  
of the proposed bypass.                </content>
