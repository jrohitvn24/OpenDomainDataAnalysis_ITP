		<title>04The lifeguards</title>
		<content>   Life Guards were first brought to   
 Jersey privately in the late 50's     
 early 60's from{South Africa}for the  
 summer season. One of these guards,   
{Bill Laverack}is still a regular on   
 the beach. Today they are all         
{Australian}and are employed by the    
{States of Jersey Tourism Department.  
 Their headquarters are at{El Tico.    
 The head lifeguard,{Gerry Shannos,}has
 been coming for over 20 years though  
 the others change annually. Most are  
 based at St Ouen's as this is the most
 dangerous beach in terms of the tidal 
 currents and the activities that take 
 place, though West Park, Plemont and  
 St Brelade also have guards. Red and  
 yellow flags are stuck in the sand at 
 El Tico and The Braye to denote       
 patrolled, safe bathing areas. Wind   
 socks are flown to show when bathing  
 is dangerous and inadvisable.         </content>
