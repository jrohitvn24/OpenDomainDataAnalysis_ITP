		<content>{1.Trees,Shrubs and Flowers.}          
 The school has a large field, which is
 mainly grass. Round the edge, trees,  
 shrubs and wild plants grow. In the   
 summer we pick blackberries, from the 
 hedges around the school. Stinging    
 nettles, Thistle, Buttercups and      
 Cow parsley grow. Daffodils are       
 popular around the field. Honesty,    
 Pansy and Hyacinth grow in the        
 gardens. There is a pond where there  
 are Kingcups,Reeds and Lilies. There  
 are lots of trees on the playing      
 field. The Ivy grows up the Ash,      
 Sycamore, Oak and Privet. The Goose   
 grass grows up the fence with Garlic  
 mustard.Daisies and Dandelions grow   
 freely. We have got some small Elder  
 berry bushes in between the brambles. 
 There are nine fir trees and lots of  
 Hawthorn in the school grounds.
