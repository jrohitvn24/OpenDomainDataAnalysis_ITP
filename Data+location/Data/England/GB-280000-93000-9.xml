		<title>09PARISH CHURCH OF ST MARY</title>
		<content> Long before a church was built, the   
 area was evangelised by monks from    
 Tavistock Abbey. The base of the      
 ancient preaching cross still remains 
 in the churchyard. Robert Le Dun      
 became the first rector in 1266.      
 The spiritual life of the parish      
 revolves around Sunday worship (led by
 the Rector and choir), and also by    
 prayer meetings and Bible Study/      
 Fellowship meetings.                  
 Outreach:- Parochial Visitors; joint  
 services with local churches; joining 
 in nationwide evangelism initiatives  
 (Mission England - Dr Billy Graham).  
 The church is full for Christmas and  
 Harvest Festival services. But the    
 spiritual backbone of the Church's    
 life and ministry is in the prayerful,
 born-again Christians who remain      
 committed to the proclamation of the  
 Gospel of Jesus Christ.               </content>
