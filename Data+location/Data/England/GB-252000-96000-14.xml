		<content> There is not a lot of social life     
 especially for young people who must  
 go to Okehampton for cinema or to     
 Hatherleigh for the occasional dance  
 or meeting of the Young Farmers'      
 Club. There is no pub or other meeting
 place except for social gatherings    
 "at home". With no public transport   
 available a car is essential and      
 adolescents must learn to drive as    
 soon as possible or continue to rely  
 on parents for transport. Women's     
 Institutes have meetings in nearly    
 every village and are well            
 attended mostly by the                
 middle-aged. Members go to Folly Gate 
 for their meetings. Social events     
 are organised to which husbands and   
 friends are invited. W.I's have       
 brought about changes in rural areas  
 and the local one is pressing for     
 restrictions on low-flying aircraft.  </content>
