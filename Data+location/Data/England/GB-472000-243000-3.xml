		<title>03The Church.    St Nicholas</title>
		<content>   The church which is near one corner 
 of the village has been on the same   
 site since at least 1087 when the last
 Domesday Book was compiled. It has    
 been altered and rebuilt several times
 throughout the centuries.             
 The vicar,the Revd.Dr.'Ted' Lurking,  
 who lives in Potterspury, is also     
 responsible for the churches at       
 Yardley Gobion and Cosgrove.          
  Each week in the church there is a   
 practice session for the choir and    
 during some days the fine organ can be
 heard as the organist practices.      
   The graveyard on the church grounds 
 has not been used for about 100 years 
 and burials now all take place in the 
 cemetery on the corner of the High    
 Street.
