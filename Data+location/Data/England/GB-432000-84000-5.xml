 Mr. Blackmore has been a parish       
 councillor for 12 years.  The parish  
 is 90 years old and is about 5 square 
 miles.  He does the job to help run   
 the parish.  There are eight          
 councillors and every four years they 
 choose who should be a councillor.    
 The councillors meet at the Memorial  
 Hall Freshwater to talk about who they
 should give money to.  Nearly anybody 
 can be a parish councillor.  What     
 concerns the council most  at the     
 moment is skip services footpaths and 
 boundry revision.
