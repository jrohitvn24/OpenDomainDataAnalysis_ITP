		<content> Everyone seems to enjoy living here.A 
 few mothers feel if the villages were 
 a little larger there would be more   
 friends for their children within safe
 walking or cycling distances. Some    
 older people would like street        
 lights.Cars have made people less     
 dependent on the village &amp; probably   
 contributed to a decline in community 
 spirit.The only meeting place is the  
 Pub &amp; this is used by a minority. All 
 are realistic that  villages of this  
 size can not support any amenities.   
 People feel that the uprooting of     
 hedgerows has gone too far &amp; are      
 particularly saddened by the removal  
 of roadside hedges. General opinion re
 straw burning was whilst there is no  
 practical alternative it is a most    
 unfortunate necessity. Strength of    
 feeling varied considerably.
