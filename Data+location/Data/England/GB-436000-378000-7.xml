		<title>07MOSS VALLEY, FIELDS &amp; WOODS</title>
		<content>      The valley has not been as badly 
 affected by agricultural change as    
 some other areas and many plants and  
 animals still find refuge in the      
 peaceful landscape.                   
      Many of the remaining woods      
 possibly date from the ice age and    
 although many have been affected by   
 man, some are still semi-natural with 
 uncommon plants and animals like wild 
 daffodil and badger.                  
      Some of the old grasslands are   
 also of great age with innumerable    
 wild flowers found only when they have
 not been ploughed or fertilised for   
 several centuries.                    
      Please refer to page 6 for a     
 report on the river habitat.
