		<content> In this area there are several local  
 newspapers such as athe West          
 Briton,The Falmouth Packet and The    
 Western Mornig News.Mostly they have  
 stories about what is happening in    
 this area.The pictures in The West    
 Briton are not very good,theybare all 
 fuzzy and when I looked at the photo  
 they had of me in "Okklahoma" that we 
 did at school this year I could hardly
 recognize myself.There are two kinds  
 of this paper,oneios just for Truro   
 and if you want that one you have to  
 look for the big black circle in the  
 top corne r.
