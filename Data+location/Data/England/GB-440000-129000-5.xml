		<content>  Sparsholt School has sixty four      
 pupils,they come from Sparsholt,      
 Littleton,Crawley and Weeke.          
  The main building was built in 1876, 
 it is made of flint,wood and bricks.It
 has a lobby,library and television    
 area.There are two temporary huts,in  
 one the infants and lower juniors have
 their classrooms and in the other     
 there is the office and top juniors.  
  On the playground there is a climbing
 frame,a sand pit and some logs.At     
 playtime we play cricket and go on our
 roller skates.When we arrive at 8:45  
 the teachers call a register,then the 
 whole school does reading,maths,      
 language,project work,games and P.E.  
  We go on quite a few trips to the    
 College of Agriculture,the Tower Arts 
 Centre,in Winchester,and in the fourth
 year to Wales or Stubbington for about
 a week.                               </content>
