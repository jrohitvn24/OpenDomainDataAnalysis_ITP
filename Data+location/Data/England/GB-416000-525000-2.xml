 Being the property of the Prince      
 Bishop of Durham,the area was not     
 covered by the Domesday book,but by   
 the Boldon Book of 1183,where West    
 Auckland is described.The village of  
 St.Helen Auckland grew up after the   
 building of the 12th.century church of
 St.Helen.The name Auckland is derived 
 from'Oak-land',for an oak forest orig-
 inally covered this district.West     
 Auckland is built around a large vill-
 age green,whilst the oldest buildings 
 in St.Helen Auckland are adjacent to  
 the church,with the Elizabethan Old   
 Hall Farm (now derelect) nearby.Most  
 of the buildings in the villages date 
 from the early 19th.century to the    
 present day.The Stockton &amp; Darlington 
 Railway,passing through the area,     
 triggered development by the consequ- 
 ent upsurge in coal mining.           </content>
