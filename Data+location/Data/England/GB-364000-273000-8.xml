		<title>08St. Mary's Church Choir</title>
		<content> The chancel arch leads to the choir.  
 The choir sit in seats which are      
 called choir stalls. There are twelve 
 to fourteen girls in the choir and    
 five adults. Mr. Booker is the choir  
 master and Mr. David Burton is the    
 organist. The choir has a processional
 cross, with which it processes to and 
 from the choir stalls. There are a    
 lot of stained glass windows by the   
 choir stalls. The East window,        
 depicting "The Vision of Piers        
 Plowman", is noteworthy. By the choir 
 stalls there is a desk where the      
 priests sometimes sit. The choir wear 
 red cassocks and white surplices.     
 The cassock goes underneath the       
 surplice. The choir gets paid every   
 year. I am no longer in the choir, but
 my cousin and two friends are still   
 members.
