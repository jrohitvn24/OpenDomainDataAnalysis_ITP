		<content> Cavendish is a pretty village nestling
 beside the "River Stour", protected   
 from unsightly development by         
 conservation orders. House prices tend
 to be beyond the reach of young       
 families and the proportion of the    
 population  over state pension age    
 (32%) is increasing. Recently the     
 Butcher and one of the two Grocers    
 have closed, it has to share a rector 
 with the larger village of Clare and  
 the roll of the 120 year old school is
 decreasing. Its future as a thriving  
 community is uncertain but its "charm"
 seems certain to survive.             
 In contrast Glemsford is built on top 
 of the hill above the Stour. The      
 village has, and is continuing to grow
 rapidly. Young families are attracted 
 to cheap housing estates, and older   
 people tend to move out, preserving   
 the population and future of school.  </content>
