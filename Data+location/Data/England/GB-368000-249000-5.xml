		<content> No clubs have their meeting place     
 in this block, but many draw support  
 from people living here. The men who  
 spend long hours either working on the
 land or commuting tend not to be as   
 clubable as their womenfolk. Nearest  
 clubs are the Stanford Bishop WI and  
 the youth club both of which operate  
 from the parish hall and draw         
 membership from broad cross section of
 the population. Many belong to Young  
 Farmers Clubs though none meet nearby.
 Children join guides and scouts. The  
 Flower, Garden, and Local History     
 societies meet in Bromyard and have   
 local members. The Bromyard and       
 District Riding Club originated in the
 area. These clubs give an opportunity 
 of meeting and exchanging information 
 on a regular basis in what could      
 otherwise be quite isolated lives.
