		<title>11A day in my life. (Child)</title>
		<content> Most of my life I spend thinking about
 my friends and doing my maths and my  
 writing.Most days I come to school and
 most nughts I play in the trees at the
 end of the road with Hannah,Sam and   
 Ben.Each morning I always want to get 
 up and at night I never want to go to 
 bed.For breakfast I have Alpen.When I 
 get home from school I have a drink   
 and a biscuit.At school I love doing  
 maths and copying out things.In the   
 playground I like playing hopscotch   
 and marbles with my friends.I play    
 with my friends climbing trees and    
 down the dyke.My favourite food is    
 steak and chips.I sometimes watch TV  
 and I sometimes read.I go running with
 my brother.My life is not boring.I go 
 to the gym on Saturday mornings and my
 Grandme comes in the afternnoon.
