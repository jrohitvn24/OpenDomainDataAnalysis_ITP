		<content>{Mount Chapel}was re-built in l882 and 
 it has 2O members.  We have a very    
 small Sunday School of 2 - my cousin  
 and myself.  We have some people going
 from the village of Mount to          
 Warleggan.  Both of these only have   
 one service on a Sunday. {Warleggan   
{Chapel}was built about l855.  The     
 chapel had more people going when the 
{Trevoder Mines}were working.          
 Warleggan chapel is very small and    
 will probably close in rhe near       
 future.  The{organist}at this chapel  
 is called Mrs. Dorothy Webster and at 
 Mount chapel it is Mr. Henry Jory and 
 Mrs. Vanda Masters.  Once when some   
 repairs needed doing the people in the
 chapel gave some money to help towards
 repairing the damage.  Some people go 
 to Warleggan Church and some to       
 Cardinham Church.
