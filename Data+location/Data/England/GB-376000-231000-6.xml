 our spare time.My Dad sits down and   
 watches the T.V.Samantha sometimes    
 plays her tapes on the radio.My Mum   
 sits down and plays with the two      
 cats.Alex plays Star Wars.Jason takes 
 things apart and plays with his teddy 
 bear.Tina plays with her BMX and she  
 plays tennis.Antony helps people who  
 work on Grove Farm.Rachael reads books
 and she plays on her swing.Adrian     
 plays football and he plays           
 tennis.Heather collects keyrings in   
 her spare time.Adam plays Star Wars in
 his spare time.My Nan does her        
 knitting in her spare time.My friends 
 live away from me so sometimes I have 
 to ring them up.We can't easily play  
 toegether because we are spread about 
 because our houses are far apart.
