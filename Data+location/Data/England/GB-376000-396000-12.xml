		<title>12Shopping in Eccles 1</title>
		<content> Eccles, like many small towns, has a  
 shopping precinct. It contains one    
 large supermarket and a variety of    
 other shops supplying goods that      
 people need every day. It has a       
 'Boots' chemist, a number of          
 confectioners, greengrocers, butchers 
 and wallpaper shops, a television shop
 and a furniture shop. On the edge of  
 the precinct is Church St. This is    
 pedestrianised and has a number of    
 shops similar to those on the         
 precinct. One shop is on the site of  
 the shop where Eccles Cakes were      
 invented. The Woolworth store has now 
 closed. At the bottom end of Church   
 St. is the Market Cross and there is  
 an open market on the corner of Regent
 Rd. which opens on Thursdays and      
 Saturdays. It sells cheap clothing,   
 greengroceries, fancy goods, fish and 
 poultry, etc.                         </content>
