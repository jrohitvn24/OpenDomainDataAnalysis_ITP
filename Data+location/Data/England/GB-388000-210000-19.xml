		<title>19A CHILD'S DAY</title>
		<content> Mum wakes me up at about half past    
 seven. I wash and have my breakfast at
 a quarter to eight. After breakfast I 
 get ready for school and walk across  
 the common with mum and my little     
 sister Hannah, who is five.School     
 starts at nine o'clock.               
 At playtime I usually have a biscuit. 
 At dinnertime i have a packed lunch,  
 but some children have a school meal. 
 In my packed lunch box I have cheese  
 and tomato sandwiches, a rock bun, an 
 orange and a drink.                   
 For tea I sometimes have spaghetti    
 bolongese followed by a banana yoghurt
 which mum makes by mashing a banana   
 and putting it in plain yoghurt. In   
 between tea and supper I play with my 
 sister or my friends. For supper      
 I have a biscuit and some milk and    
 then I go to bed, but I have a bedtime
 story. Catherine Daniels (8)          </content>
