		<title>02THE POST OFFICE LANGTOFT</title>
		<content> The range of service that the post    
 office provides are postage           
 stamps,giro,pensions,family           
 allowance,premium bonds, stamp        
 collecting and other things. It also  
 sells things that are nothing to      
 do with the Post Office like socks and
 other things.The best thing that Mrs  
 Flatters likes is when old people come
 and get their pensions on Thursdays.  
 Inside the Post Office there are      
 shelves in the right hand coner and   
 near the counter there is a rack with 
 cards on it.On the left hand side     
 there is a rack with papers and comics
 on it.Straight in front of you there  
 is a counter with glass in front of   
 it,this is to stop robbers jumping    
 over the counter and getting the      
 money.
