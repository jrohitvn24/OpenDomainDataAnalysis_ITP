		<content> We have puppet theatres visit school  
 and sometimes we go up to Beacon Hill 
 school to see drama or music performed
 by groups of professional travelling  
 players.                              
 We also go on week long educational   
 trips to the county outdoor pursuits  
 centres at Hawwse End and Fellside.   
  We also go to places like London,    
 Minehead, Pwllheli and Barry Island.  
 The last two places are for Venture   
 Weeks at Butlin's camps where we get a
 chance to try sports and activities we
 cannot do here.                       
 We play football and netball against  
 schools within a ten mile radius, also
 we take part in cross-country         
 competitions.                         
 The school itself was built in 1894   
 and has a dining hall and two         
 classrooms built in the 1940's.We     
 have a large playing field.           </content>
