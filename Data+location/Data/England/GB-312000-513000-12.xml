		<content> The water was very cold but we found a
 deep pool and had lots of fun.        
           When we returned we all     
 helped to prepare the barbecue        
 outside.It was very tasty although the
 hens kept trying to pinch some.By now 
 it was getting quite late.We all went 
 in doors,had a few games and read     
 books or chatted until supper         
 time.After supper we went to bed,tired
 but happy.
