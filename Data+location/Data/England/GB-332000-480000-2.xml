		<content>   The estuary of the rivers{Crake}and 
{Leven}takes the form of a large area  
 of{sand and mud-flats.}The tide floods
 the estuary twice a day in a great    
 rush of water which takes about half  
 an hour to cover the mud-flats.       
 Around the estuary man has built many 
{embankments}in order to reclaim the   
 low-lying land.This land is now used  
 for grazing purposes.A few trees have 
 been planted,especially as windbreaks 
 around buildings.                     
   Wading birds feed on the mud-flats  
 at low tide.Many fish live in the     
 water and it is a popular fishing     
 area. The{river channels}are          
 constantly changing due to the effect 
 of tide,river floods and winter       
 storms.The channels were recently     
 altered due to the effect of the      
 building of a new road bridge a short 
 distance upstream.                    </content>
