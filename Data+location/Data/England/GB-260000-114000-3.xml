  The plant processes fresh cut grass  
 into{pellets for animal feed.}Grass is
 brought to the pad where it is        
 conveyed into a tumble drier for about
 a minute.Then it is milled into a     
 powder which is compressed into grass 
 pellets.60 tons can be made in a day, 
 but only 30 in wet weather.4,500 tons 
 of pellets are produced in the        
 summer.These are stored until the     
 winter,when they are sold to farmers, 
 either direct or through merchants.   
 Recently,{additives}such as           
 cereals, proteins, minerals, molasses,
 sugar beet and vitamins have resulted 
 in the pellets being made into a      
{complete food}for cattle, sheep, goats
 or horses.The equipment is designed to
 save energy.Four years ago the        
 evaporator was the first of its type  
 anywhere in the world.                </content>
