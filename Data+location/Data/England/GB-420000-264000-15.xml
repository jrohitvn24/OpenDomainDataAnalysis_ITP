		<title>15My hobbies - horse riding</title>
		<content> My hobby is horse riding.  I go to    
 Lane Farm which is just down the road 
 from our house.  I go with my sister  
 Susan and my best friend Kylie usually
 goes with us.  The clothes you wear   
 are jhodpurs or trousers, a riding    
 jacket or a jumper, wellies, riding   
 boots or jhodpur boots and a hat which
 is essential.  You can get a crash hat
 which is the safest hat you can get.  
 You must wear a hat because if you    
 fall off it could save you from       
 serious head injuries.                
 I enjoy going because it is fun and I 
 like the fresh air.  I like sitting on
 the pony and cantering along and doing
 jumps.  It is an interesting hobby and
 I like it very much.
