		<content>   The houses in our area are 80%      
 semi-detached, 15% terraced and 5%    
 detached.  There are three sets of    
 terraced cottages.  We know that one  
 set of cottages was built in 1906.  In
 Coombfield Drive there are about 200  
 houses and in Hillrise there are 143  
 houses.  There are about 100 bungalows
 in the area.  Now about a third of the
 Council houses have been bought by    
 their occupiers.                      
                                       
   There is a block of flats which is a
 three storey unit.  There are 5 two   
 storey blocks for Old Age Pensioners. 
                                       
   Along the main road there is a house
 which used to be called "Sheffields". 
 When it was called "Sheffields" it was
 a sweet shop.  Now it isn't a sweet   
 shop.  It is now a fruit and vegetable
 shop.                          CONT.  </content>
