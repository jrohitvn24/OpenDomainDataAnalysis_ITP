		<title>17       ECOLOGY : EAST SHEEN</title>
		<content>  Richmond Park is a large Royal park  
 with many different types of trees -  
 oak, elm, beech, hawthorn, willow and 
 cherry. The oldest are oaks; many of  
 the young trees are protected by fence
 guards.                               
  Wildlife includes many Red and       
 Fallow Deer as well as rabbits, foxes,
 squirrels; birds include moorhens,    
 coots, duck and pigeons. Fish are     
 found in Beverley Brook.              
  In the general area of Sheen, most   
 streets are lined with limes and      
 cherries. There are large areas of    
 grass and flowering plants, many      
 species having 'strayed' from         
 cultivated gardens. Some moss and     
 fungi are found on walls.             
  The quality of the environment has   
 recently been improved by the work of 
 the Keep Richmond Tidy Group. In 1984,
 we won the a national  K.B.T. award.  </content>
