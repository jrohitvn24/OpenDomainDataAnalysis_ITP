		<title>07BLUE BELL INN RANSKILL</title>
		<content> We came to the Blue Bell Inn on the   
 first of November 1984.I was surprised
 to find the inside of the building was
 so large when it looked so small from 
 the outside.The pub consisted of 4    
 rooms,the lounge,the snug,the public  
 room and a games room.There was one   
 bar to serve all these rooms.The      
 toilets I found were outside across a 
 yard.Our kitchen was behind the bar   
 from which,we also found our lounge   
 and a pantry.There was a door which   
 led to the yard and the boiler room   
 where our dog and cat were to sleep.  
 Another door from the kitchen led     
 upstairs to a long corridor with 6    
 doors,1 bathroom &amp; toilet and 5       
 bedrooms.We soon got to know other    
 people around the village.Soon the pub
 will be 'done up' because it is in    
 quite a state!
