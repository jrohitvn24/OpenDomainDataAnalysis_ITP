		<title>06HOUSING IN ATWORTH</title>
		<content>  HOUSING_POPULATION                   
  The population of the Atworth area   
 stands at approximately 1000 and has  
 increased little over the years.This  
 is in the main due to the drainage.Any
 substantial increase in building would
 neccestate a new sewer at very high   
 cost.So infill housing has been the   
 rule.                                 
  The majority of houses are           
 owner_occupied while there are some   
 tied cottages and a small amount of   
 council accomodation.The elderley are 
 provided for at Shell Court,a Local   
 Authority sheltered housing block.    
  The ages of the population was       
 surveyed,by the History Group &amp; the   
 chilren from Atworth school,in        
 1978.80% of people were found to be   
 over 16,an ageing population but one  
 that is still able to support a       
 school.                               </content>
