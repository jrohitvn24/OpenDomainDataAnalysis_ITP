		<content> The Somerset Trust for Nature         
 Conservation exists to save animals   
 and plants which are in danger. There 
 are many trees such as Sweet Chestnut 
 tree and Horse Chestnut tree and there
 are animals such as badgers, frogs,   
 toads, drakes and bats.               
 The Quantock Hills are designated as  
 an area of outstanding natural beauty 
 and so the Trust has made Fyne Court  
 as an interptetation centre with      
 nature trails designed to contribute  
 towards the understanding of the      
 wildlife of the Quantocks and the     
 problems of their conservation.       
 The junior section of the Trust       
 includes the Badger Club for primary  
 school children.                      
 The Trust employs two full-time       
 conservation officers based at Fyne   
 Court.                                
                                       </content>
