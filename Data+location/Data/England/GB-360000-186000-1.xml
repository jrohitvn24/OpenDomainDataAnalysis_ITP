		<title>01  A Guide To Alveston</title>
		<content> Alveston is a large village in the    
 north of Avon.It is placed on a       
 limestone ridge above the River       
 Severn.It is surrounded by countryside
 which makes it a lovely place for a   
 walk ,nature studies or just running  
 around.On a walk in Alveston's        
 countryside you might walk up one of  
 the steep hills.From the top of the   
 hills there is a great view of the    
 Severn Bridge and Wales.There has not 
 been any big industrial development in
 Alveston.Houses have not been built in
 great quantities in Alveston since the
 1960's when a large amount of houses  
 were built.Since the 1960's most of   
 the plans of expanding Alveston have  
 been turned down.Alveston is not      
 expected to grow a great deal for     
 quite a long time.
