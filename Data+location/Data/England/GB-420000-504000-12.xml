		<title>12A Day in the Life of Stephen</title>
		<content> I got up at 8.45 a.m., washed and     
 dressed. It was raining again ! I     
 switched on the T.V. to watch{'Roland 
{Rat Superstar'}then turned to{B.B.C.1}
 to see the{'Pink Panther'.}I had      
 cornflakes for breakfast.             
 It had stopped raining so my{brother  
{Roy,}Mum and I walked up the village  
 to the bus stop a mile away. We caught
 the bus to{Richmond}and went to the   
 swimming baths. When we came out of   
 the pool we dressed and went upstairs 
 to the cafe and had lunch. I had ham  
 and tomato sandwiches, a tin of       
{'Coca-Cola'}and some biscuits. Roy had
 a meat pie and Mum cheese sandwiches  
 with a drink of coffee.               
 We walked into Richmond, went into    
{Woolworth's}and looked at the toys.   
 Then we went to a shoe shop and Mum   
 bought Roy and me a pair of new school
 shoes each.We then caught the bus home</content>
