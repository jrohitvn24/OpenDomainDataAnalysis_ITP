{ _________________________            
  On Tuesday evenings most weeks of the
 year  you  will see a number of ladies
 converge  on  the  village hall  for a
 session of "Swing into Shape". We  are
 ladies of varying  ages from 16yrs. to
 56yrs., but the  majority  of  us come
 into the category of mums with growing
 or grown up families. We are trying to
 put  some shape back into our  bodies,
 with some degree of success.          
  An  experienced  teacher  guides   us
 through   the  two  hour  session   of
 carefully  planned  exercises to music
 to try and work our bodies  back  into
 shape. Once a year  classes  from  all
 over the county meet for a huge 'Swing
 into Shape' session.                  
  Our dress consists  of  leotards  and
 tights, the  basic  design  being  for
 ease of movement.                     </content>
