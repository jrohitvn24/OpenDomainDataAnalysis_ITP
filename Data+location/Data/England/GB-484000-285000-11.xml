		<title>11PRIVATE HOUSING</title>
		<content> Danesholme estate has private housing 
 in{six}of its streets.The houses are  
 all made from{different coloured      
{brick}(unlike the council houses).    
 Some of these houses have double      
 garages,and some of their gardens are 
 quite big.All of the private houses   
 have{front}and{back}gardens,most of   
 which are well cared for.             
   The private houses look a lot       
 flashier than the council houses on   
 the outside.                          
   The private houses on the estate    
 tend to be around the edges of the    
 estate near the countryside or        
 Kingswood.                            
   A lot of the people who own private 
 houses on Danesholme lived in other   
 parts of Corby before they moved to   
 Danesholme.
