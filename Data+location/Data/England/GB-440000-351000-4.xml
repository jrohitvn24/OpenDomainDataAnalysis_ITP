		<content> In our marching band we have got black
 and yellow uniforms. The music we play
 is Crystal Chandeliers, Ribbons of    
 Blue, Only you, Sealed With a Kiss,   
 Take the High Road, Down by the       
 Riverside and Shores of Tripoli. We   
 play instruments like kazoos, drums,  
 bellyres, maracas, tambourines,       
 bass drum and tenordrum. We practice  
 twice a week in the Youth club. David,
 Kath and Dawn, who live in the        
 village, teach us. We visit local     
 places where we do a road march then  
 we do a display of marching on a      
 nearby field. We get judged on road   
 march then we get changed and eat our 
 lunch after that we go round the      
 stalls and then get changed again for 
 display. After display we get the     
 results and see if we have won        
 anything.Then we go home for our tea.
