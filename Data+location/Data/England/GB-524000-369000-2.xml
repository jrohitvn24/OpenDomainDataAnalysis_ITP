		<content>    Around Horncastle the average farm 
 has about 200 hectares.  The main     
 crops are winter wheat, sugar beet and
 oil seed rape.  The farmer we spoke to
 has 32 hectares of land and grows     
 winter wheat, barley and half an acre 
 of potatoes to sell locally.  He also 
 grows sugar beet for the factory at   
 Bardney.                              
   The busiest time is at harvesting   
 between July and October. Most farmers
 have the facilities to store grain but
 some with small farms have to sell    
 straight off the combine harvester.   
 After harvesting, the farmer prepares 
 his land for drilling again.          
    Seed is sown early in the year and 
 vegetables are planted out in spring. 
 Most farmers, therefore, have to take 
 their holidays during the winter      
 months.
