 My Dad is one of the leaders of       
 Mickley Youth Club. It is held at St. 
 George's Parish Hall every Wednesday  
 night. Boys and girls from 11 years   
 upwards can join.                     
 The other leader is a woman called    
 Vivien.                               
 At the club snooker, table tennis,    
 darts, cards and dominoes can be      
 played. You can  buy sweets and pop   
 and sometimes hot dogs and coffee.    
 Sometimes they go to the seaside or   
 the ice rink. Sometimes they have     
 inside bowls and screen printing.     
 The leaders also take members on      
 visits to other youth clubs. Team     
 competitions are held in the club     
 regularly.  The youth club is very    
 popular in our village.
