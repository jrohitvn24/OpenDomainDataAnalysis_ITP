		<title>09Farming in Twyford</title>
		<content> There are a total of 16 farm houses   
 with assorted buildings and land      
 ajoining in the block.9 of the farms  
 include arable land,the rest are all  
 grassland.5 farms milk but their stock
 has been cut by the government due to 
 Common Market regulations.10 farms    
 keep breeding sheep and 12 keep store 
 cattle.3 breed pigs and 2 keep        
 chickens in deep litter for egg       
 marketing, although most keep a few   
 free-range chickens for their own egg 
 needs.One farm breeds race horses.The 
 growing of cereal crops is increasing 
 apart from the wetter land by the     
 river.Cereal crops can be seen in all 
 parts of the block. All the farms are 
 family farms.                         
 There is very little outside farm     
 labour just some contract labour for  
 shearing and harvest.
