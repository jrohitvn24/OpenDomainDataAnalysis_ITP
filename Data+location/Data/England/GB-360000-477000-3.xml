		<title>03FARMING IMPROVEMENTS</title>
		<content> Although farming has not affected     
 conservation it has developed rapidly 
 in recent years.Farmers say that their
 work is now much faster and easier    
 because of the introduction of        
{machinery}.As the area produces little
 milk,it has been relatively unaffected
 by the{milk quotas}imposed by the{EEC.
 As farming techniques have advanced   
 the use of isolated barns has         
 decreased and some are in decay,while 
 others have been converted into       
{holiday homes.}Farming is much more   
{intensive}now than formerly and       
 so considerable use of{fertilizers}to 
 increase the yields from fields,      
 especially with crops such as{silage  
 which is used as winter feed for the  
 animals.In a good year two or three   
 cuttings may be made.There is some    
{concern}about these{chemicals}on      
 streams and rivers.                   </content>
