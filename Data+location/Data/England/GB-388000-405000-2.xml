 The oldest building in Chadderton is  
 in Healds Green,and it is now known   
 as the Institute. It will be 200 years
 old in 1989. The Institute was built  
 as a chapel for methodists and as a   
 hall for everyone. The Institute is   
 now a place where social functions are
 sometimes held.                       
     Most of Healds Green is green     
 belt, there used to be a farm called  
 Mount Pleasant, now we can only see   
 the ruins. Healds Green is not very   
 big,it only has 41 houses. At the     
 bottom of the hill there are cottages,
 silk weavers lived and worked in them.
 There is only one road in Healds      
 Green, it goes up the hill and on to  
 Chadderton Heights.
