		<title>17HARLOW CYCLE MUSEUM .</title>
		<content> Mr.John Collins' bicycle collection   
 forms the core of{Harlow Bicycle      
{Museum .}It was opened in{1982}in the 
 former stables of Mark Hall mansion.  
 Inside are five galleries which each  
 show a different aspect of bicycle    
 history.Outside,{the Gardens}have been
 replanned and people can sit there in 
 tranquility.Here are some of our      
 thoughts about the Museum .           
 "The Hedges boneshaker bike looked    
 very bumpy and uncomfortable to ride."
 "The Penny Farthing was too high up ."
 "I wouldnt be able to ride it because 
 I couldnt reach the pedals ."         
 "The plastic bike looks as if it would
 fall apart as you ride it ."          
 "I could rest if I were on the back   
 seat of the tandem ."                 
 "The gardens were peaceful,I'm going  
 to take my Gran ."                    
 "They look different from our bikes!" </content>
