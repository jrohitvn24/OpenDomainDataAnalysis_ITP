		<content> There are two main types of land use  
 in the areea, agriculture and gravel  
 extractions. Most of the arable       
 farming is carried out in the S &amp; SE. 
 Main type of crops being grown are    
 wheat and barley. Some farms such as  
 Paynes Farm is the type commonly found
 in the Lee Valley that produces market
 garden crops ie tomatoes, cucumbers,  
 lettuce and peppers whilst some of the
 nurseries are concerned with growing  
 pot plants for indoor use and border  
 plants for gardens. Of the latter type
 of farm a common feature is the       
 greenhouse where growing conditions   
 can be regulated by the farmer. On    
 these nurseries the farmers have      
 acquired the expertise of bringing in 
 the crop/flower to fruition at the    
 appropriate time of year, and in a    
 growing number of cases are even able 
 to produce crops 'out of season'.     </content>
