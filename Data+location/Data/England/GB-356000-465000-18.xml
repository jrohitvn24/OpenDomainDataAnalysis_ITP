		<title>18FLOODING IN THE LUNE VALLEY</title>
		<content>The River Lune floods the riverside    
pasture on average 6 times per year.The
farmhouse and outbuildings of farms    
with land on the valley floor are sited
near the foot of the valley slope safe 
from flooding and from where a watch   
can be kept for signs of flooding.When 
houses were built behind the Fenwick   
Arms in the 1970's they obscured the   
view from Shaw House Farm.In 1978 the  
farmer built a new farmhouse behind    
his old house to regain his view.He    
moves his stock inside for a couple of 
days in the event of a flood.They will 
not graze the pasture immediately after
flooding unless rain  has washed the   
grass.The Claughton and Farleton Beck  
meet on his land which compounds the   
problem of flooding.
