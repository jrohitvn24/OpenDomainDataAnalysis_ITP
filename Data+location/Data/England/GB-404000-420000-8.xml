		<title>08LOCAL INDUSTRY</title>
		<content> Since the soil is too poor and the    
 land too steep for the growing of     
 crops,{farming}concentrates upon the  
 production of milk and meat. There are
 several local farms that supply the   
 area with "green top"{milk.}This milk 
 is untreated and is from tested and   
 approved cows. The milk is very rich  
 and full of goodness. Beef cattle and 
 sheep are raised for meat.            
                                       
 The{textile mills}were the main       
 employers in the past, but the        
 industry has declined considerably.   
 Many mills have been converted into   
 warehouses or house other small       
 industries.                           
                                       
 Many of the local people now work in  
{commerce}and the{professions,}and     
 travel daily to other towns and       
 cities.                               </content>
