		<title>14CORBY'S HOLIDAYS IN THE 80'S</title>
		<content>Our class carried out a survey to      
discover what sort of holiday (one week
or longer, spent away from home) are   
taken by people in our area. By        
sampling adults in our area we found   
that:                                  
1) Most people (92%) had at least one  
holiday of a week or more.             
2) 54% had one holiday per year. 32%   
had two holidays each year.            
3) Just over half (54%) of the holidays
taken were one week in length.         
4) 61% of the holidays were taken in   
Britain. Most foreign holidays were    
spent in Europe with Spain being the   
most popular destination (31% of all   
foreign holidays).                     
5) A variety of types of accomodation  
were used. Almost one half of the      
holidays were based in guest houses and
hotels.                                
                                       </content>
