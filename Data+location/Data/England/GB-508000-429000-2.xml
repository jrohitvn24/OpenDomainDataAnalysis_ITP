		<content> Many residents of the inner-area wards
 of Hull are victims of the wider      
 economic and social malaise.Lack of   
 job opportunities and a marked        
 deterioration of the physical         
 environment are contributary factors  
 to many of the problems which beset   
 our society today. Working in{Social  
{Priority Schools}we see every day  the
 effects of marital breakdown,one      
 parent families, neglect, lack of     
 discipline, and the general trauma of 
 trying to keep a family together on   
 limited resources.Side effects such as
 alcohol,solvent abuse,vandalism and   
 petty crime are increasing. Efforts   
 are being made to provide constructive
 assistance through slum clearance     
 programmes,improving older housing    
 areas,building community centres,and  
 utilising wasteland for recreation.   
 Many voluntary organisations assist.  </content>
