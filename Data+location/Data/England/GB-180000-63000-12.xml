		<title>12TREVELGUE HEAD</title>
		<content> The original settlers on Trevelgue are
 thought to be the Celtic tribe, the   
 Dumnonii, but two of the barrows are  
 thought to date before their arrival  
 in Britain. Occupation of Trevelgue is
 thought to have been continuous for   
 about 8 centuries. This would have    
 been from about 3 B.C. to 5 or 6 A.D. 
 Trevelgue Head was a prime site for   
 occupation. The combination of iron   
 deposits,nearby woodland and its      
 suitability as a port made it an      
 important site and this is believed to
 be the reason for such a long         
 continuous occupation, and also why   
 Trevelgue was so heavily defended. As 
 well as the number of ramparts their  
 size (at least 3O ft. when            
 constructed) contributes to           
 Trevelgue's  importance.
