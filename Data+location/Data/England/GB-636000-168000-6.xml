    There is no heavy industry in our  
 area; only small-scale light          
 industrial units, such as the         
 ink-manufacturing company where       
 Melanie's father works as a research  
 chemist.                              
    His job is to work on small samples
 of ink, blending colours until the    
 right colour is formed., according to 
 the "recipe" in company's books.      
    If the colour is right, then larger
 quantities go into production. It is  
 used mainly for printing on fabrics,  
 plates and posters. The basic process 
 of manufacture is from coloured       
 pigment powders, which are first mixed
 to give a syrupy consistency, then    
 thinned to the required consisitency  
 for use.
