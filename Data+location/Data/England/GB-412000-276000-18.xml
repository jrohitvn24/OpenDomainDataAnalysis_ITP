		<title>18A Parish Priest in Solihull</title>
		<content> Our Parish Priest has been a          
 priest for 36 years and parish priest 
 of{Our Lady of the Wayside}in Shirley 
 since 1962. He moved from England to  
 Ireland because he felt he would be   
 more of a missionary. In Ireland 98%  
 of the people are Catholic but in     
 England they are a minority of only 5 
 million.                              
    Our priest has become well known   
 throughout many countries of the world
 due to the vast amount of aid which   
 he has sent to the Third World. During
 the year leading up to July 1985 he   
 has sent over Â£500,000 in medicines to
 poor countries. To Ghana he sent      
 medicines and equipment valued at     
 Â£17,866; to Madagascar Â£50,000 and to 
 Ethiopia Â£30,000. For the Â£26,000 aid 
 he sent to Poland he was awarded the  
{Polish Gold Cross}which had not been  
 awarded for 50 years. (Cont.)         </content>
