		<title>09WEST MERSEA SEA WALL.</title>
		<content> The sea wall is situated on West      
 Mersea in between Ray Island and the  
 caravan park. The reason for having a 
 sea wall is because without one the   
 Island would slowly get washed        
 away, as every time the tide comes    
 in it takes part of the mud away.     
 The sea wall starts at the Strood, and
 goes down to the Dabchicks Sailing    
 Club. On foot, it is about a fifteen  
 minute walk. The sea wall used to look
 like just a grassy mound, but now,    
 concrete slabs are being layed to make
 the wall stronger for years to come.  
 The work on this stretch of the sea   
 wall has taken a few years to         
 complete.
