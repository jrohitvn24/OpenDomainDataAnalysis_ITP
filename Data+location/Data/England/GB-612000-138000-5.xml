		<title>05POLLUTION AND CONSERVATION</title>
		<content> Pollution is caused by large scale use
 of chemical fertilizers,especially    
 nitrates &amp;  by spraying pesticides    
 and fungicides.  Conservation. To cut 
 down on nitrate fertilizing,the dairy 
 farmer is experimenting with Lucerne  
 &amp; Clover growing and uses cattle      
 manure for as much fertilizing as     
 possible.He avoids all fertilization  
 on areas with rare plants &amp; is tree   
 planting in the "dead" corners of     
 fields to achieve a measure of pest   
 control by birds.Another farmer has   
 enlarged old brick clay pits to form  
 small lakes for trout fishing and for 
 water reservoirs. Water life is       
 returning to the area again,with ducks
 swallows,martins &amp; water plants such  
 as the double marsh marigold. Trees   
 &amp; hedges are left as far as possible  
 to encourage bird nesting.
