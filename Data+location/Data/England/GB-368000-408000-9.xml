		<title>09BOLTON SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Bolton School was re_endowed in 1913  
 as a single foundation by Sir William 
 Hesketh Lever,Bt, later the first     
 Viscount Leverhulme, and to his       
 generosity and foresight it owes the  
 splendid buildings and playing fields.
 The two divisions of the school, Boys 
 and Girls, derive respectively from   
 the Boys Grammar School, founded some 
 time before 1516, and the Bolton High 
 School for Girls  1877.               
  The school moved  to its present site
 in 1897.A completely new building in  
 red sandstone was completed in 1965   
 and additions and adaptations continue
 to keep facilities up to date.As an   
 independent school,following many     
 years as a Direct Grant school,it is a
 participant in the D.E.S. Assisted    
 Places Scheme.Under this scheme help  
 with fees is available to successful  
 11+ examination candidates.           </content>
