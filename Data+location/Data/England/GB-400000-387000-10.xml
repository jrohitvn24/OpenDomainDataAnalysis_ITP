		<title>10A TYPICAL DAY IN MY LIFE.</title>
		<content> On Saturday  mornings I get up about  
 nine thirty then I have a hot drink   
 and something to eat. After that I    
 usually go swimming then I go home for
 my dinner. After that I go and help   
 two of the local people over at the   
 cricket field cafe,though different   
 people do it each week.I stay all day 
 at the cafe we make the food for the  
 cricketers then we tidy up. It takes  
  us ages,I always have my tea at the  
 cafe on Saturdays so I don't need any 
 when I get home.                      
 On Saturday nights I stop in now. I   
 didn't used to though, I used to go   
 out with my friends who live across   
 the road. Now I play on my atari      
 unless there is anything good on t.v. 
 Sometimes on Saturdays I go to my     
 sisters. I also go a lot in the week. 
 I think Saturday is my favourite day.
