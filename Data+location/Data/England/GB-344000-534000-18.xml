		<title>18HUTTON ESTATE - MAINTENANCE</title>
		<content>  The Estate Maintenance Department now
 comprises a master joiner, Mr R Allen,
 employed since 1969, and an assistant 
 bricklayer/mason, Mr R Morley,        
 employed since he left school in 1956.
                                       
  They are based at the Estate Yard,   
 Unthank, where there is a joiner's    
 shop, wood storage facilities, and a  
 stack yard.  Some of the wood used is 
 homegrown hardwood, while most        
 softwood is bought in.                
                                       
  Of recenct years much of their work  
 has been doing repairs to houses,     
 cottages and farm buildings on the    
 Estate, particulary to the roofs. In  
 addition a considerable amount of work
 has been done to the 'Hall' in        
 connection with 'House Opening'       
 activities.
