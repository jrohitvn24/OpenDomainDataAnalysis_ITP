		<content>{The British Telecom Research          
Laboratories} opened on a l00 acre     
wooded site at Martlesham in 1975      
1,700 people moved into the new        
laboratories which today house more    
than 2,400 people. Some 1,500 are      
professional engineers,scientists      
or mathematicians. About 800           
technicians provide technical support  
and many of these are recruited locally
and trained at Martlesham. Up to 200   
graduates are recruited each year from 
the best in the country.               
Some of the many new buildings are     
general purpose like the main          
laboratory block which dominates the   
landscape. Many have been built to meet
specific needs such as a large Â£clean  
area' for processing intigrated        
circuits or the special facility for   
testing submarine cables at simulated  
deep-ocean pressures.                  </content>
