		<title>12Felixstowe Dock - History.</title>
		<content>In 1875, the Felixstowe Dock and Pier  
Co. was formed. Then, in 1882, work on 
the tidal basin commenced. It was      
finished and ready for use in 1886. At 
this time, the dock consisted merely of
the tidal basin and a few warehouses.  
It was first used as a cargo port with 
no passengers.  Just before the port   
was opened, a railway link had been    
opened with Westerfield, 13 miles away 
close to the Great Eastern Railway     
line. The first passenger train ran on 
1st. May 1877. It was owned by the     
Felixstowe Dock and Railway Co. Soon   
after this, the first freight train    
came to Felixstowe as Colonel Tomline  
was developing his port.  The          
passenger train service didn't make    
much money so the railway and rolling  
stock were taken over following the    
Great Eastern and Felixstowe Railways  
Act 1887.                              </content>
