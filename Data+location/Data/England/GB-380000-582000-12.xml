		<title>12BELLINGHAM AUCTION MART.</title>
		<content>                                       
 The mart which is a meeting place for 
 local farmers has been in existence   
 for many years.It is important to the 
 people of the North Tyne and          
 Redesdale,not only for buying and     
 selling sheep and cattle,but for the  
 social contact it gives.Buyers come   
 from as far afield as Cumbria,Scotland
 and Lincolnshire. There are about ten 
 or twelve marts per year,selling both 
 cattle and sheep.There are two rings  
 which makes things much easier when   
 both sheep and cattle are being sold. 
 At the end of May there is also a     
 furniture sale,which is one of the    
 highlights of the year for many local 
 people.On Friday- viewing- evening the
 rings are packed with people,all      
 looking for a bargain.The most recent 
 use for the ring was a production of a
 play by the local Dramatic Society.   </content>
