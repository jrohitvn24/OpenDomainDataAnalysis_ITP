		<content>    A very flat district, some of it   
 below sea level, now intensively      
 farmed. The area forms part of the    
 'Black Fen', where the soils are      
 derived from peat laid down when the  
 water level was higher than it is now.
 Formerly used for grazing and fuel    
 cutting, improvements in drainage     
 made this some of the most productive 
 land in Britain.                      
   Today a population of about 50      
 people work almost exclusively on the 
 land. Some holdings are in the hands  
 of large institutions, while others   
 are owner occupied. Some land is owned
 by the Sir Edmund De Moundeford Trust 
 in Feltwell and there are also some   
 County Council smallholdings.
