		<content>  The area concerned lies a few        
 kilometres west of the city of Wells  
 in Somerset. It contains five         
 settlements of village or hamlet      
 size,namely Wookey,Yarley,Henton and  
 Bleadney. There are also several farms
 and the overriding impression is one  
 of a rural landscape.                 
  A significant feature is that the    
 villages are sited in an almost       
 continuous line along the slightly    
 higher ground just above the old flood
 levels of the Somerset moors,and they 
 are linked together today by the only 
 road of note in the area, the B3139.  
  To the south,the villages are backed 
 by residual hills of lias rock,such as
 Ben Knowle Hill. Although of no great 
 height(100 metres maximum) they make a
 marked contrast with the surrounding  
 flat,low-lying drained moors of clay  
 and peat.                             </content>
