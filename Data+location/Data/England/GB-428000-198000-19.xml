 The whole area is rich in natural     
habitats; there are well established   
hedges, river banks, a lake and many   
small areas of woodland.               
 In the hedgerows a profusion of wild  
flowers grow among the shrubs and      
trees. Owing to the maintainance of the
hedges, common wild plants, which are  
disappearing elsewhere are flourishing.
Valerian, Meadow Sweet, Balsam and Hop 
thrive amongst Maple, Dog Rose, Bramble
and Blackthorn.                        
 Due to the great length of hedge and  
wood edge there is a good variety of   
bird life to be seen. Winter flocks of 
finches and thrushes feed on the       
berries; woodpeckers and tits feed in  
the trees while flocks of Lapwing,     
crows and gulls feed in the fields on  
grubs and slugs. The barns and old     
trees provide homes for owls and hawks.</content>
