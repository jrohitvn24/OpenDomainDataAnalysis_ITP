		<title>20BMX  BIKES  IN  EXETER</title>
		<content>   In 1985 they are building a BMX     
 track down at Marsh Barton. When it is
 finished it will be one of the best   
 tracks in Great Britain and on August 
 25th 1985 a lot of top BMX riders are 
 coming to Exeter to test the track. A 
 BMX track is a course that you ride   
 over on a special bike called a{BMX. }
 When you go round the track you do    
 jumps and other things on the course. 
 The bikes are specially designed so   
 that they can take the punishment of  
 landing after a jump.                 
 Cycling Profiency is a course you     
 have to do to show your skill at      
 riding a bike and if you pass it you  
 get a certificate and a badge. We have
 all done Cycling Profiency at school  
 and nobody failed.
