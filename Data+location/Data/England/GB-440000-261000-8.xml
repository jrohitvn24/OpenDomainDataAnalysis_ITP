		<content> At school, a wide range of sporting   
 activities are available. In winter   
 rugby, football, netball and hockey   
 are played while gymnastics are       
 pursued indoors. Southam School has a 
 sports hall where the above games can 
 be played in bad weather. This hall is
 also used after school hours by the   
 community for badminton clubs etc.    
  Summer sports include rounders,      
 cricket, tennis and athletics. Schools
 generally have a sports day when      
 classes get together and compete      
 against each other.                   
  Playground games differ from those   
 played at home. British Bulldog is a  
 favourite game. One child tries to    
 catch another from a group as it      
 passes him. If someone is caught, he  
 then helps the first child. This      
 continues until everyone is caught.   
 "Tig" is another popular game.        </content>
