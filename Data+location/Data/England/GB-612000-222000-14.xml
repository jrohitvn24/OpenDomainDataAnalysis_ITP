		<content>   We met an 85 year old man in The    
 Street.  Although retired now, he had 
 worked as a coach driver.  He liked   
 Shredded Wheat for breakfast and he   
 gets up at 7.30 each morning. He did  
 not like the decimalisation of our    
 money and prefers the Â£ note to the   
 coin. He lives in a flat but prefers  
 detached houses.  He thought that     
 people in the village were very       
 friendly.  He has a daughter and a son
 who are twins.  The son is a          
 professional footballer, playing for  
 Southend United.  He also told us that
 he had won Â£5,400 on the football     
 pools some time ago.                  
   We were sitting in the bus shelter  
 with him, one of his favourite places 
 to sit and watch.  We were very       
 pleased when he showed us some        
 photographs of his family which he    
 kept in his wallet.                   </content>
