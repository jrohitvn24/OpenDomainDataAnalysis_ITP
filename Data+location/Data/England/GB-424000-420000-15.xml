		<title>15TRANSPORT IN DEWSBURY</title>
		<content> A ring road is presently being built  
 by-passing Dewsbury, thus diverting   
 traffic from the town centre.The cost 
 of the project is Â£3.5 million for 1.5
 miles of road. There are 5 major roads
 leading into Dewsbury and a traffic   
 count was done on the Wakefield       
 and Leeds Roads aiming to discover the
 average flow of cars and lorries into 
 and out of Dewsbury.On Wakefield Road 
 cars going into and leaving Dewsbury  
 averaged about 300 per hour. On Leeds 
 Road there were fewer cars per hour-  
 218 and 234 respectively.Wakefield    
 Road had 106 lorries per hour into    
 Dewsbury and 80 per hour leaving.On   
 Leeds Road the numbers were 24 and 54 
 per hour respectively.There is a      
 British Rail station in Dewsbury on   
 the trans Pennine Liverpool to        
 Newcastle route with an hourly service
 each way, plus local trains.          </content>
