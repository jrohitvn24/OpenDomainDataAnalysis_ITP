		<title>07FARMING -FIELDS,CROPS PANTON</title>
		<content>{PANTON}is a mainly arable area but    
 there are some grass fields. The      
 largest of these is a 76 acre "rig and
 furrow" field: this field is remark-  
 able for its size being such ancient  
 grassland and has a central causeway  
 along its length.  The main crops     
 grown at{PANTON}are winter and spring 
 barley (for annual feeds and brewing),
 winter and spring wheat (feed-stuffs  
 and bread making), oil seed rape (for 
 animal feeds and margarine and oil for
 human consumption). The soil-type is  
 medium loam to heavy clay and the     
 majority of the fields have been under
 drained in recent years. Many of the  
 fields are 2O-5O acres and most are   
 still bounded by thorn hedgerows.     
 There is however still some destruct- 
 ion of hedges taking place with much  
 disapproval of conservationists and   
 other thoughtful people.s             </content>
