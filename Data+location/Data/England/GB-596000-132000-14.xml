		<content>   Our lunch on Sunday is usually a    
 roast joint which is eaten around     
 1.00p.m. This can be either beef,pork 
 or lamb roasted in the oven with      
 potatoes which have been peeled and   
 put in the oven with the meat to cook 
 for between 1 and 2 hours. We also    
 have 1 or 2 other vegetables. The     
 pudding is generally something  a     
 little special, perhaps lemon meringue
 pie-pastry base covered with lemon    
 filling and a fluffy meringue on      
 top-or cheesecake-biscuit base covered
 with sweet yoghurt or cream filling.  
   In the afternoon we do some         
 administration work and have          
 sandwiches and cake for tea at about  
 5.30p.m.The children then do there    
 musical practices and go to bed as    
 during the week.                      
   The routine of our life does not    
 vary much excepr on special occasions.</content>
