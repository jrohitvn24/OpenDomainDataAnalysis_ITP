		<content>       At the weekends during the      
 Football season I like to go with my  
 dad to the Elland Road Football ground
 to see Leeds United play.When we go we
 go in one of the boxes where you have 
 to pay a lot of money.We try to go to 
 every home match. It is good fun. When
 we score everybody stands up and      
 shouts with excitement. At the end we 
 go downstairs for a drink. If we have 
 won we have a celebration.            
         Sometimes we might go to away 
 matches but only if these are played  
 in Yorkshire or close to home.When we 
 go away I always wonder what it will  
 be like but it is usually like Elland 
 Road. Most of the grounds look just   
 the same.During the summer when there 
 is no football I  play cricket for    
 Calverley Cricket Club. I am a wicket 
 keeper and I also play in this        
 position for school.                  </content>
