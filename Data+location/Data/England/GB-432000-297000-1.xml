		<title>01Witherley and environs</title>
		<content> This rural area contains the villages 
 of Witherley and Ratcliffe Culey, the 
 hamlet of Atterton and part of the    
 village of Fenny Drayton.             
                                       
 Most of the area is farmland, the     
 farms being medium-sized and a mixture
 of arable and livestock. Several of   
 the farms in Witherley are owned by   
 Lord O'Neill, who lives in Ireland but
 pays regular visits to his tenants.   
                                       
 Witherley is the home of the          
 Atherstone Hunt Kennels, where the    
 hounds are kept for fox-hunting in the
 area.                                 
                                       
 Modern housing in the area is largely 
 occupied by people who work in nearby 
 towns and cities.
