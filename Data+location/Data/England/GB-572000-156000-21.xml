<title>21THE BARRACKS, MAIDSTONE (2011)</title>
<content>

In 1990-1992 the barracks in town made way for the extended dual carriage way (A229) to Chatham. All that remained is the Officers' "Mess" now the "White Rabbit Inn". 36 Engineer Regiment at Invicta Park had its entrance moved for the new road layout and new vehicle workshops were built. The road at this stretch is called Royal Engineers Road.&lt;br />&lt;br />The Springfield Library Tower Block, build in 1968, is a landmark just opposite the 36 Engineer Regiment barracks. A new build library on the land of the old barracks by the river is almost complete. Proposals to build 114 new flats after demolishing Springfield Library tower block were discussed in 2009.&lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
