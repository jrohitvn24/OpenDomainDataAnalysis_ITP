		<content> This is how we play{Queen Oceoceo.    
 Sombody is on.They have a ball.They   
 can throw the ball anywhere they like.
 But the person must have his back to  
 the other children so that he can't   
 see which one of the children has got 
 the ball.The children say "Queen      
 Oceoceo who's got the balleo  I havent
 got it,it isn't between my legs see". 
 Then the children open their legs.The 
 person turns round and has to guess   
 who's got the ball.If he says some    
 ones got the ball and they havent     
 another person is on.If he gets it    
 right he is on again.He can say they  
 are an empty dustbin,that means they  
 haven't got the ball.He can say Kings 
 Passing and go past the children.If   
 sombody catches rhe ball he or she    
 says Fish and Chips then the person   
 who caught the ball is on.
