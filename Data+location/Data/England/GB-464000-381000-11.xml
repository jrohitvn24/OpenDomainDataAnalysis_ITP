		<title>11RANBY 'CAMP'</title>
		<content>   The site of Ranby Prison, locally   
 known as Ranby 'Camp', has been in    
 official use since the First World    
 War, when it was the location of the  
 East Retford Airfield.                
   It was used as a training airfield  
 by the Royal Flying Corps. It was     
 mostly engaged in night flying.       
   No. 187 Squadron was formed on April
 1st 1918, under the command of Major  
 T.H.Irons. The aircraft flown were    
 BE2c's, Sopwith Pups and Camels, De   
 Havilland 6's and AVRO 504k's. The    
 squadron was disbanded on May 1 1919. 
   In the inter-war years the airfield 
 was used for flying displays, but     
 during the Second World War it was    
 used by the Army as a primary training
 centre.                               
   In 1950 the camp became the base of 
 the 19th Tank Transporter Squadron and
 remained so until the summer of 1969. </content>
