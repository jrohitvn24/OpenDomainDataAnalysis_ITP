		<content> When the children were interviewed,   
 they gave their favourite recreation  
 as playing sport such as football or  
 activities such as running; cycling;  
 swimming and roller skating.          
                                       
 Most children spend time watching     
 television, mainly children's         
 programmes but also some adult ones.  
                                       
 All the children we saw were members  
 of some club such as Brownies, Guides,
 Cubs or Scouts whilst others were in  
 a dance group or swimming club.       
                                       
 We found that a majority of both      
 adults and children enjoyed the       
 outside type of activity particularly 
 where this involved being a member of 
 an organised group.
