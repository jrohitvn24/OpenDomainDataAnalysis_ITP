		<content>    Many people nowadays think church  
 is a solemn place but they are wrong. 
 Many fun things happen at church. At  
 the moment we are preparing for our   
 festival week. Many people taking part
 are putting up their tableaux for it. 
 A large group of ladies including my  
 mum are sewing new tapestries for the 
 kneelers wich are long and narrow and 
 show local and country scenes. Six    
 people from Ticehurst form a bell     
 ringing group. On average about twenty
 people sing in the choir on Sunday. We
 have choir practice every Friday at   
 6.30. The congregation is usually     
 regular except on special occasions.  
    On every first Sunday of the month 
 we have a family service. Sunday      
 school joins in with this. I think    
 they are better than other services   
 because the sermons have pictures to  
 illustrate them.                      </content>
