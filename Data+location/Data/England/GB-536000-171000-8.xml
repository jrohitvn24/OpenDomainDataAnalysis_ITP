----------------                       
The sun shines high, up above. Kids    
with dripping lollies running, to      
parents, waiting for the yell."Mummy,  
Daddy, my lollies broke, from my stick 
buy me another one". The child climbs  
in to the pushchair and they move on.  
Behind them a girl with long blonde    
hair, swiftly moving, softly treading, 
knowing something, but what she knows  
will never be told to another soul. The
stains crease her face, but the cheeky 
grin banishes them. She looks and sees 
a tall, old man, she runs and is swung 
into the arms of the man, a parent she 
has never seen. The man, he grins a    
tired smile and thinks of what might   
have been.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
