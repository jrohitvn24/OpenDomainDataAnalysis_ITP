		<content>{Wivelsfield Village Hall}was built in 
 1981,to commemorate the{Silver Jubilee
 of{Queen Elizabeth the Second.}It was 
 built with a combination of money     
 raised by the villagers and grants. It
 has become a focal point for the      
 village and is used for functions of  
 all kinds. It replaces the 'Reading   
 Room' which was given to the village  
 by a benefactor.The needs of the      
 village outgrew the Reading Room and  
 the lack of car parking became a      
 problem.A small room in the new hall  
 perpetuates the gift.                 
                                       
 The hall is light and bright with a   
 view over the village green. It       
 contains a large and a small hall each
 with a kitchen and toilet facilities. 
 The large hall contains a stage for   
 plays and other productions.
