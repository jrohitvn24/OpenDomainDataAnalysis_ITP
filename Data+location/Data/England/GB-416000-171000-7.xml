		<title>07TREE SURVEY _ OGBOURNE AREA</title>
		<content>  The aim of this survey was to study  
 the distribution, type and purpose of{
{trees}on a route from Rockley via     
 Ogbourne Maizey to Ogbourne St Andrew.
  In the{villages,}the trees are mostly
 decorative and fruit trees.           
  On the{farms,}they have been planted 
 as windbreaks, and there are screens  
 of ash, silver birch, beech, sycamore,
 oak, maple, holly, elm, hawthorn,     
 hazel and conifers.                   
  Along the{roadsides}are poplar       
 saplings, old hedges and occasional   
 ash trees.                            
  Along the{riverside}are old and      
 sapling willows.                      
  There are very few trees on the      
{downland,}just occasional shelter     
 belts of beech and/or conifers.
