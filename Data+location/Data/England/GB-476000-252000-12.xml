		<title>12Quinton Village</title>
		<content> Quinton is a very small village of    
 approximately 250 inhabitants, living 
 in a scattered community. There are no
 shops, post office, or public house,  
 so the villagers rely on mobile       
 traders, and the mobile library       
 service. There is also a shuttle      
 service to the local child welfare    
 clinic. A private company, Johnson's  
 Buses, runs a daily service into      
 Northampton, with more services on    
 Wednesdays and Saturdays, which are   
 Market days.                          
 Local organisations present in the    
 village include the Womens Institute, 
 Guides and Brownies, a Youth Club, and
 Sunday School.
