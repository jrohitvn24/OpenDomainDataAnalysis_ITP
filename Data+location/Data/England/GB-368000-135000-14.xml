		<title>14  Life In Quaperlake Street</title>
		<content>{Life in Quaperlake Street has changed 
 immensely over the years.For instance 
 there used to be many services and    
 shops,now there are only five shops   
 and far fewer services or businesses. 
    The shops include one selling      
 clothes,two specialising in           
 antiques and one electrical.There is  
 also a dentist,a bowls club,playschool
 and a cattle haulage business.        
    The changes that have taken place  
 show that smaller shops and smaller   
 factories or businesses have,over the 
 last forty or fifty years moved away  
 from the area or closed down.         
    One local resident told us that all
 these changes are entirely due to     
 "progress" and must be accepted.      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
