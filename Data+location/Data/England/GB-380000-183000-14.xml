		<title>14A FARMER'S DAY.</title>
		<content> Mr.T has one of the largest farms in  
 the area.He is past 65 years of age   
 and still works 7 days a week.        
 He wakes up at 6.30 a.m.His first job 
 is to feed the horses and check their 
 welfare.They are not for farm work but
 for racing.                           
 He then drives to the village shop for
 his newspapers the "Sporting Life" and
 the "Daily Mail".After breakfast he   
 plans the day with his son and the    
 'strapper'(a local name for a casual  
 farm labourer.)                       
 Today they are preparing a field to   
 receive cattle and will fence it's    
 perimeter.At 1.00 p.m. they break for 
 lunch (a brief snack) and work until  
 6.00p.m. and that is the end of their 
 working day until the season reaches  
 harvest time.Rains have spoiled the   
 1985 harvest.13 people work the farm  
 at harvest time.                      </content>
