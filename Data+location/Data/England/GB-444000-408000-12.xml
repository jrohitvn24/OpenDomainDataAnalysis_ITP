		<content> When you get to{Frickley Pit}there is 
 a lane that goes alongside it.As you  
 go down the lane there is a{conveyor  
 belt which throws all the coal rubbish
 away,then a massive truck comes and   
 waits underneath the conveyor to carry
 the waste away.There are mountains of 
 waste that we call{tips.}They are     
 trying to landscape them with silver  
 birch,hawthorn and oak saplings and   
 they are also planting grass but much 
 is left to nature.                    
 In the nearby fields you can hear all 
 kinds of{birds,}such as Chaffinches   
 and Skylarks.You can see{Winkhouse    
{Farm,}acres of farmland and Howell    
 Wood in the distance.There are two    
 farms on Broad Lane,{East Farm and    
{West Farm.}East Farm is a listed      
 building. One is still a working farm 
 but the other is now just a house.
