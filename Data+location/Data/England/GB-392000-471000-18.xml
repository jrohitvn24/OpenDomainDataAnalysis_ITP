		<title>18FOOTPATHS IN LITTONDALE</title>
		<content>   From Arncliffe paths go over the    
 surrounding fells and also by the     
 River Skirfare, which make pleasant   
 and interesting walks of varying      
 degrees of difficulty.                
   One path leaves from near the       
 church, going down river to Hawkswick;
 while another goes up-river to Litton.
   Paths over the moor go from Old     
 Cotes Farm to Starbotton, and from    
 Blea Heads, through Byre Bank Wood    
 over the top to Kettlewell.           
   The path from behind the Falcon Inn 
 goes over Arncliffe Clowder to Malham 
 Tarn and Field Centre, at one point   
 meeting up with the Pennine Way.      
   The paths by the river are gentle   
 walks, but those over the moors are   
 fairly strenuous, and proper walking  
 gear is really necessary. These paths 
 link up with other paths as part of a 
 network of paths covering the Dales.  </content>
