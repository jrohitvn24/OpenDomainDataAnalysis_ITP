		<title>12Cople Bier House</title>
		<content>  In the front garden of a modern house
 there  is a shed.  This was the parish
 bier house  of Cople. It was  built in
 the  late 19th - century to  store the
 bier.                                 
                                       
  A  bier  was  a  cart  used  to carry
 coffins  into the church for funerals.
 When  the  house  was  built  the bier
 house  was in the garden. The owner of
 the  house  agreed to keep it, and the
 County  Council gave a grant for it to
 be re-built.
