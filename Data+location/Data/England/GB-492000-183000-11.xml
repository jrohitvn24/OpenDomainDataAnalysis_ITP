		<title>11OUR HOUSES (Continued)</title>
		<content>3.My house is"Broadway House"on the    
main A355,Beaconfield Rd.The original  
house was called"Dunholme"built 1903.  
At one time greengrocers owned it,so   
there is a huge garage for their       
lorries.It fell into disrepair and was 
divided illegally into flats.Tramps and
squatters slept downstairs.The name    
"Broadway" dates from the 1950's.We    
moved in there,1971.We made many alter-
ations and even found a secret         
staircase!                             
4.I live in one of the original        
servants' cottages,now on the A355,of  
the big house "Ingleglen"no longer     
there.It is one hundred and twenty     
years old.My house still has some beams
mainly in the kitchen.In 1984,some of  
the ceiling collapsed and my bed       
landed in the kitchen.Luckily,I was    
not in it!
