		<title>07ROADS AROUND COLD ASHTON</title>
		<content>    For the main part,{transport}goes  
 through the area rather than about    
 it.The{A46}road takes vehicles from   
 Bath to  Gloucester and Cheltenham or 
 to the{motorway (M4)}junction at      
 Tormarton and thence to London or     
 Wales.The 2 roads cross at a large    
{roundabout}at Cold Ashton. This       
 recently replaced traffic lights as is
 the custom at present.                
    There are 5{buses}aday from Bristol
 to Chippenham and a less frequent     
 service to Bath. A private bus goes   
 through the lanes once a week to pick 
 up villagers anywhere along the       
 route.The large supermarket 5 miles   
 away provides free transport once a   
 week.                                 
    A{traffic count}mid morning showed 
 many lorries using both roads,as well 
 as private cars. The roads are very   
 busy morning and evening.             </content>
