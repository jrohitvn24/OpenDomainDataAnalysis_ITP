		<title>04 The Village School</title>
		<content>There has been a school in Woodford    
Halse since the 1840's.Only children   
from the village went there.In 1895,   
when the railway opened,the population 
grew and by 1914 there were two        
schools.After the 2nd.world war they   
became a Primary (5 years to 11 years) 
and a Secondary (11 to 15).In 1970 the 
Secondary School was closed and the 11+
children now go to Southbrook          
Comprehensive School in Daventry.The   
Primary School moved into its building.
 Children now come to the school from  
other villages where the school has    
been closed,such as Eydon,Preston      
Capes,Little Preston,Canons Ashby and  
West Farndon.There are 137 children,86 
Juniors and 51 Infants.There are 6     
teachers;Mr.Weaver(Headmaster),Mrs.    
Gottowik(Deputy Head),Mr.Smith,Miss    
Berry,Miss Hewison and Mrs.Conlon.
