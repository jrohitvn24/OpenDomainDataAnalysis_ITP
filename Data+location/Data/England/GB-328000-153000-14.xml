BEACH, THE BONES OF WRECKED BOAT, THE  
NORTHERN ARE EXPOSED AT LOW TIDE AND   
PROVIDE AN INTEREST FOR YOUNG AND OLD. 
   IN 1897, A WESTERLY GALE DROVE THE  
NORWEGIAN BARGE ONTO THE BEACH AT      
BERROW.THE CREW WERE TAKEN OFF BY THE  
BURNHAM-ON-SEA LIFEBOAT AND LATER, AS  
THE TIDE DROPPED, THE CAPTAIN WAS ABLE 
TO JUMP INTO THE SURF AND WADE ASHORE. 
DESPITE EFFORTS MADE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE 
TO REFLOAT THE BARGE.THE FIGUREHEAD    
ADORNS A LOCAL COTTAGE AND SOME OF THE 
TIMBERS WERE 'RESCUED' AND USED BY     
LOCAL FARMERS.                         
   TODAY, THE KEEL AND RIBS CAN BE     
EXPLORED AND THE COPPER NAILS AND      
GRANITE BALLAST FORM ON INTEREST TO    
YOUNG EXPLORERS.
