		<title>05The New Peterborough</title>
		<content>  The latest chapter in the history of 
 Peterborough is very much on people's 
 minds at the moment. For the past     
 decade Peterborough has been changing 
 dramatically under the influence of   
 the Development Corporation. This is a
 Government agency which has had the   
 task, in conjunction with the city and
 county councils, of planning and      
 shaping the new Peterborough. We who  
 live here, both long-term residents   
 and newcomers, have watched the       
 continuing changes with interest, and 
 have felt their effects as they have  
 happened.                             
  With very little dissent our         
 collective feeling has become one of  
 pride as the heart of our city has    
 been attractively developed and the   
 new housing areas have been landscaped
 with abundant shrubs and trees.
