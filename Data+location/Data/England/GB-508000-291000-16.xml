		<content> My dad works on a family-owned farm.  
 The crops they grow are linseed,rape, 
 barley,maize and corn.Dad mends       
 tractors,shears sheep and injects     
 bullocks with fattening hormones and  
 puts tags in their ears to show they  
 have been injected because it makes   
 them go a bit wild.They keep brown and
 white Herefords,black and white       
 Friesians,beige Charollais,lighter    
 beige Simmentals and brown with pink  
 ears Belgium Blues.We make silage in  
 spring.The farmer owns 1500 acres     
 where they keep bullocks, sheep       
 and chickens.They send their animals  
 straight to market.The markets they go
 to are Stamford on Monday,Thrapston   
 and Melton Mowbray on Tuesday and     
 Banbury on Wednesday.Four of the      
 farmer's family work on the farm and  
 three employees.
