		<content> Coombe Hill stands on the busy  A38   
 road there are about 40 buildings but 
 no schools.The younger children have  
 to go 3 miles to their nearest school.
 The older children have to go 6 miles.
 There is 1 Post Office,2 Garages,1 Pub
 and 1 Public Telephone box in the     
 Coombe Hill area.There are no         
 entertainments in Coombe Hill except  
 the Swan Inn.The nearest              
 entertainments are in Tewkesbury where
 there are disco's,Bingo and a Cinema. 
 A Caravan Park is being built behind  
 the Pub for the tourist trade.The     
 nearest place for shopping is         
 Tewkesbury,some go to Cheltenham.The  
 bus service runs every 2 hours to     
 Cheltenham and Tewkesbury.Most people 
 also have cars.Most people work       
 outside,away from the village as there
 is no industry there.The area is quiet
 and convenient for the M5 Motorway.   </content>
