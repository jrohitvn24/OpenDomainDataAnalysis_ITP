		<content>{ GRAVEL EXTRACTION                    
 Glacial gravels cover much of the     
 higher land on both sides of the Colne
 Estuary.Gravel is extracted by        
 mechanical grabs from open pits.It is 
 sorted on the spot through a hopper   
 then via conveyer belts to sorting    
 pits.It is washed and graded into sand
 for building and gravel of various    
 sizes ranging from 1.5" to 0.375".The 
 larger sizes are bought by British    
 Rail for railway ballast.Smaller      
 gravel and sand is bought and         
 collected by local builders.          
 When a pit is exhausted,the gravel    
 company is legally obliged to restore 
 the land for farming.In the past this 
 was not so,and some old pits are used 
 by angling clubs,such as older pits at
 Moveron's and for Nature Reserves such
 as Fingringhoe Wick Reserve on the    
 West bank of the Colne.               </content>
