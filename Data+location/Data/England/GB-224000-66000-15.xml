    Tremabe Farm has 111 acres and is  
 farmed by Mr. Stephens. There is one  
 field of potatoes, two fields of      
 barley and the rest is grass. The     
 stock on the farm consists of 100 ewes
 and 4 suckling cows. There are also   
 some Charolais, Scimital and Limousin 
 cattle which are used for showing at  
 the County shows. On the farm there   
 are two tractors  but most of the work
 is contracted out.                    
                                       
    Some of the farm buildings are old.
 One of them was built in 1800. There  
 was an old water wheel on the farm    
 which had been used for grinding corn.
