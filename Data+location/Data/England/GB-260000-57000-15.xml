		<title>15Fardel Farm,Cornwood</title>
		<content> Fardel farm,owned by Mr.Derek Dennis, 
 consists of 375 acres and supports a  
 Pedigree dairy herd of Freisians and  
 Holsteins,built up over 30 yrs.Mr     
 Dennis,and his son Jeremy,milk 140    
 cows,producing on average 2000 litres 
 per day,and rear approx.200 followers 
 &amp; calves.Common Market regulations    
 have meant a cut-back in quota this   
 year.The farm has 1 bull,although most
 breeding is artificial,using eggs from
 best milkers, implanted into surrogate
 cows of lesser quality, which are then
 inseminated(artifically).200 hoggets  
 are run on the land in winter,when the
 cattle are kept under cover.Grass is  
 cut(3 times over per year) for silage,
 while hay harvesting has been abandon-
 ed as too time-consuming and uneconom-
 ic.A small amount of Spring barley is 
 grown.Despite large machinery,only one
 hedge has so far been removed.        </content>
