		<title>04A TRAFFIC SURVEY IN BURTON</title>
		<content>  Until 1967 traffic in Burton grew    
so much that the town was nearly       
brought to a standstill. Then a new    
by-pass was opened to carry the main   
A38 away from the town. In a survey    
of one hourÂ£s traffic on an ordinary   
working afternoon in 1985 we found the 
following:-                            
   The total number of vehicles was    
1700, almost evenly divided between    
northbound and southbound. There were  
780 cars, 730 lorries, 170 vans and 20 
buses. The goods carried included      
building materials, iron/steel, scrap, 
oil and petrol, food, chemicals,       
furniture, milk and beer. Building     
materials were most often carried, with
110 lorries involved, and beer the     
least, with only three. As Burton is a 
brewery town, this was surprising.     
   It is very good that these vehicles 
are no longer clogging the town.       </content>
