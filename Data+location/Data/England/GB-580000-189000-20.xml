  Schools were responsible for the     
 following pages:3,4,5-Sweyne;6,7,8-   
 Down Hall;9,10,11-Wyburns;12,13,14,15 
 Grove;16,17,18,19-Edward Francis.     
 PUPILS VIEWS:"it was interesting and a
 change from normal work...it will be  
 very useful for the people in the     
 future to see the shops we have...more
 time would have been good...some of   
 the detail work was boring...smaller  
 areas would have made more visits     
 possible...I enjoyed using Yellow     
 pages and the maps.                   
 STAFF VIEWS:Time was too limited.The  
 central organisation was often more a 
 hindrance than a help.The BBC seemed  
 to have made little attempt to work   
 out the practical problems in advance.
 Nonetheless it was felt to be useful  
 exercise and simulation,assisting     
 schools to cooperate an work as one.  </content>
