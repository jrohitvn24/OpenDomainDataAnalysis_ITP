		<title>01Combwich and Surrounds.</title>
		<content>    At the heart of this area lies the 
 village of Combwich,which is situated 
 on the west bank of the River Parrett.
 The river widens and sweeps through a 
 flood plain notable for wildlife,as it
 pushes towards Bridgwater bay.The     
 river is tidal leaving mudflats at low
 tide and becoming a deep racing river 
 at high tide.                         
    To the west of the village lie the 
 Quantock Hills. Between them and the  
 river are fertile farmlands and       
 quarries of limestone sandstone.On the
 other side of the river,the pastures  
 of Pawlett Hams provide good grazing  
 for farm animals.                     
    Barely 3 miles from the village is 
 nuclear power station,providing       
 electricity for the south west and    
 employment for some villagers.Others  
 work in the light industries of       
 Bridgwater Town.                      </content>
