		<title>15FAMILIES AND FOSTERING</title>
		<content> My Mum and Dad foster difficult       
 teenagers who have been led to behave 
 as they do because they have not had a
 normal family pattern to follow. Very 
 often I come home from school to see  
 my Mum talking to yet another Social  
 Worker. Then she would come in and say
 "Would you mind if we had another     
 foster boy?" Then the child would     
 come. I remember one boy,             
  treated us like normal brothers      
 and sisters. Another boy              
 who is a punk and looks tough, really 
 is nice. Sometimes we have a policeman
 coming round. One boy                 
 stole some objects and C.I.D. men came
 round to retrieve them. When I tell my
 Mum something and she tells me to go  
 away, this makes me feel left out. I  
 like to think that my Mum and Dad have
 love for children less fortunate than 
 myself and my brothers.               </content>
