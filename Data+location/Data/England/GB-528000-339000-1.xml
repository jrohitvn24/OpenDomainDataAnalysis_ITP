		<title>01FRAMPTON - AN INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content> This is a rural area with four        
 separate communities within it. The   
 largest place is{Wyberton}which is now
 almost a suburb of Boston. There are  
 council and private housing estates   
 supporting a primary school.{Frampton}
 a smaller village has developed along 
 the main roads of its area. There is  
 no shop and community life centres    
 around the Church and Village Hall.   
 The hamlet of Frampton West End has no
 shop but the church hall is used for  
 social functions.{Kirton End}has a    
 post office but no hall.              
 Most land is used for{agriculture}and{
{horticulture,}and a ministry {        
{experimental station}is sited on      
 Willington Road. There are very few   
 hedges in the area, most field        
 boundaries being ditches.The{old      
{railway line}will soon be lost when   
 the new A16 is built.                 </content>
