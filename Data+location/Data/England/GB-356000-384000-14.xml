		<title>14MANCHESTER SHIP CANAL</title>
		<content> The section of the {Manchester Ship   
{Canal}which passes through our area is
 due to close unless other uses or     
 alternative methods of financing it   
 can be found.This quotation is part   
 of a statement released by the{M.S.C  
{Company}on 11.4.84."The Ship Canal    
 from Eastham to Runcorn is sound and  
 successful and we can keep it so.But  
 our customers there cannot and will   
 not pay for the losses above Runcorn. 
 In 1983 the company lost about Â£2m.on 
 the Ship Canal above Runcorn.In 1984  
 the loss is likely to be greater. By  
 early 1987 the Sludge Ships will have 
 gone along with important oil traffic.
 There is no prospect of attracting any
 thing like the traffic we are losing..
 The company is therefore...forced to  
 the conclusion that the{M.S.C}above   
 Runcorn will have to close." Latest
