 Edinburgh:-John was born in Somerset  
 and lived in Bristol as a child.      
   Fourteen years ago Adrienne was sent
 to Birch Hill Hospital as a post-gradu
 ate social work student to complete a 
 placement in the Social Work          
 Department there.Subsequently,she was 
 offered an appointment in the         
 hospital and, for some time worked in 
 Littleborough while continuing to live
 in Prestwich (North Manchester).      
    Eleven years ago,having decided to 
 buy a house,they looked in the        
 Rochdale area as it was close to Birch
 Hill Hospital and eventally brought   
 their present house in Calderbrook

 dwellers but enjoy living in a country
 area.They are very dependent on motor
