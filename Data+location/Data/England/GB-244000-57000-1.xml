		<title>01OUR CURATE</title>
		<content>                                       
 A curate is a vicar's assistant. He   
 attends different sevices throughout  
 the week like weddings, funerals,     
 baptisms;and,visits certain people who
 are sick and have problems to talk    
 over.                                 
                                       
                                       
 In a service he would wear a white    
 surplice over a cassock which is a    
 long flowing black robe. He has a     
 clerical collar around his neck,which 
 shows that he has turned away from the
 rest of the World,and is doing what   
 God wants him to accomplish. The      
 collar has a piece of white plastic   
 going through it to show he is a      
 vicar.
