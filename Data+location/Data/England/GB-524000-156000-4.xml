		<content> The north downs chalk, although close 
 to the surface, is overlain here by   
 'clay-with-flints' a common drift     
 deposit. Apart from a small flat top, 
 the wood slopes to NNE. On the        
 nutrient-rich lower slopes (115 m)    
 the woody flora is very mixed and     
 includes; Hazel, Elder, Ash, Birch,   
 Dogwood, Field Maple, Goat Willow     
 Sycamore, Oak, Yew, Holly, Hawthorn,  
 Gean, Rowan, Bramble, Ivy, Dogrose,   
 Raspberry, Honeysuckle, and Old Man's 
 Beard. Higher up at 140 m, Beech      
 appears and becomes abundant since the
 chalk is only 60cm down in places. On 
 the flat area at 160 m an even mixture
 of Oak and Beech appears. In this wood
 Ash, Oak and Beech are all showing a  
 reasonable age diversity. In some     
 places where senile trees have been   
 lost the Council have tried some      
 replanting. Ground flora on page 05.  </content>
