		<content> There are Guide,Brownie and Cub groups
 in Ropley.There isn't a Scout troop as
 they can't find a leader.I am a Guide 
 and we meet every Friday from 6.30 to 
 8.30 in the hut by the Coffee Rooms.We
 are a small company of about 15 with a
 head Guider,Miss Cass,and a helper,Mrs
 Nelson.There are two patrols,Robins &amp; 
 Kingfishers.In the summer we practise 
 camp skills and outside activities.In 
 the Winter and on rainy summer days we
 work for badges,future outings,camp &amp; 
 other events.At present we are working
 for the District Challenge Competition
 against other guides in the Alresford 
 area.At the end of term some of us are
 going on a weekend practice camp here 
 in Ropley and the more experienced    
 Guides are going to Rushmoor for a    
 weeks camp to celebrate 75 years of   
 Guiding.
