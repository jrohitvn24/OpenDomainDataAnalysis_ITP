		<content> In a survey of residents of Westlands,
 only a minority were content with the 
 amenities on the estate. A significant
 number were critical at the lack of   
 general services.  Highest on the list
 was the lack of playing space for     
 children and general youth facilities 
 on the estate.  Criticism was         
 expressed at the lack of medical and  
 banking facilities and poor shopping. 
 There was a general concern at the    
 lack of 'civic' pride and the general 
 untidiness and appearance of the area.
 Roaming dogs featured high on the list
 of complaints. Some residents were    
 unhappy about the high density of the 
 development, the lack of privacy that 
 ensues and the problem of noisy       
 neighbours. This was generally blamed 
 on the poor soundproofing qualities of
 the houses. An improved bus service   
 into Droitwich was also called for.   </content>
