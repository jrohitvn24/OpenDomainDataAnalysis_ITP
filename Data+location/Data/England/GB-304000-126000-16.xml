		<content>    We asked Mr Burston (aged 72),an   
 old pupil and ex-caretaker,about the  
 changes he had seen in the school     
 during his life.                      
    When he was at school,children     
 walked or ran to school, there was no 
 school transport. There were bells at 
 nine o'clock and at quarter past. If  
 pupils arrived  after the second bell,
 they were caned.                      
    He remembers having the cane on    
 many occasions! Once he was caught    
 eating  an apple (scrumped of course!)
 in class, and received three strokes  
 on each hand.                         
    There were no school dinners, they 
 were lucky if they had a piece of     
 bread and dripping. All teaching was  
 done from the blackboard, without many
 text books.  Football was with a rag  
 ball, and cricket played with a       
 homemade bat.                         </content>
