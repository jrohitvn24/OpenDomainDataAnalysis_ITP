		<content>   As well as the woods considered     
 elsewhere and several small recreation
 grounds, there are 3 important{open   
{spaces}in the area:                   
 1){John Burrows Recreation Ground}.   
 2){Belfairs Woods}.                   
 3){Hadleigh Downs}.                   
   John Burrows Recreation ground and  
 Belfairs Park both have{playing fields
 and{tennis courts}but Belfairs also   
 has a{golf course}and a{trotting      
{track}set among extensive woodlands.  
 The horse-riding facilities include a 
{riding school for the disabled.       
   The pasture and woods at Hadleigh   
 Downs offer fine views and contain the
 ruins of Hadleigh Castle. Although    
 this land is farmed, access is good   
 via several public footpaths. Plans to
 develop this area as a{country park}  
 have made little progress to date.
