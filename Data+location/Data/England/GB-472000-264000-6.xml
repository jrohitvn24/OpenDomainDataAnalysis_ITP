{      }In this part of the project we 
 shall be talking about the news in    
 Northampton on the radio and in the   
 newspaper. Our local BBC radio station
 is in the centre of town and          
 broadcasts on 1107 VHF and 96.6       
 STEREO. We also have a local          
 independent radio station which is    
 Hereward radio and broadcasts on      
 medium wave and VHF.                  
      The two local newspapers within  
 Northampton are Chronicle &amp; Echo and  
 the Post. These papers only contain   
 local news and not news from out side 
 Northampton. The Chronicle &amp; Echo is a
 nightly paper that you have to pay for
 but the Post is free and comes weekly 
 on a Thursday night.                  
                                       
                                       </content>
