		<title>06POLICE IN BUCKHURST HILL</title>
		<content> The local police station has 30-40    
 constables,who work 8 hour shifts.The 
 station has 4-5 Pandas,a station van &amp;
 1-2 Rovers.                           
 In this area the commonest crime is   
 buglary as we have many large detached
 houses.There is also a problem with   
 thefts from cars in station car       
 parks.Drugs do not seem to be a       
 problem,but there is a bit of         
 glue sniffing.We do not have many     
 muggings but handbags have been       
 snatched.No recent murders.           
  There are still too many accidents on
 the road,about a thousand injuries a  
 year.Few children are run over even   
 though traffic is heavy in the area,it
 is mostly local and commuter          
 traffic.heavy lorries have been       
 reduced as they now go on the M11 &amp;   
 M25 motorways.                        
                                       </content>
