		<title>10BUILDING MATERIALS</title>
		<content>   During our survey of the buildings  
 in Alderton we also considered the    
 materials used in the building of     
 roofs and walls.                      
   Out of the 125 buildings surveyed   
 110 had tiled roofs, 9 slate, 3       
 thatch and 3 other materials.         
   The survey of the walls revealed    
 that 55 buildings were built of       
 reconstituted stone, 54 of brick, 10  
 were of mixed construction, 5 of      
 natural stone and 1, the village hall 
 of timber.                            
   The houses built of reconstituted   
 stone are modern and this material is 
 used as a cheaper alternative to      
 natural stone and complies with       
 planning regulations.                 
   the brick houses were all built     
 before planning regulations were      
 introduced.                           
                                       </content>
