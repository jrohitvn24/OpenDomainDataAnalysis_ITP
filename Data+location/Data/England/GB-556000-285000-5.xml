		<content> One{reporter}is responsible for the   
 Littleport page in this area's paper. 
 His contacts are made by getting      
 involved, visiting people, going to   
 board meetings and getting to know    
 people.The main issues are the school 
 moving to Ely, and the{by-pass.}The   
 final deadline is Monday, and the     
 Littleport page comes out on Thursday.
 In Littleport there are plenty of     
 shops and friendly people but there   
 is a shortage of things to do.        
 The problems of Littleport are no     
 investment of money and no access. The
 advantages will be the by-pass and the
 short ride to{Cambridge.}Littleport   
 will change in the future by growing. 
 The closure of{LVC}is a bad thing for 
 youngsters because they lose contact  
 with Littleport. The by-pass is a good
 thing as it will bring new businesses 
 and homes. There are 2 free weeklies. </content>
