		<content>   Martinstown on Saturday isn't boring
 ! I get up for breakfast-crushed      
 cornflakes! and I sit around watching 
 television. Mum often takes us into   
 Dorchester shopping, just like my nan 
 used to when she wasn't much older    
 than me. Of course we go by car unlike
 my nan who had to cycle everywhere,   
 even to work. We come home for dinner.
 I like beans, or egg on toast, because
 it doesn't take long to eat.          
   After dinner I do my homework until 
 my little sister Polly nags enough for
 me to go to the playground. It's good 
 fun there's a slide, swings and bars, 
 we go there every Saturday and race to
 be first on the swing.                
   We go home exhausted but Polly will 
 soon want to go out again. We carry on
 like this until tea.                  
   I like Martinstown on Saturdays!
