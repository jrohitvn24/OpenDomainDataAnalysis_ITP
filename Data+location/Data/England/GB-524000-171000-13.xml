famous for greyhound racing,stock car  
racing and speedway(motor bikes).      
Wimbledon also has a famous football   
team which has recently beaten Halifax.
In between a pub and the football      
ground is a small roadway,blocked off  
by a gate.Behind the gate is the back  
of the changing rooms.There is a big   
car park reserved for the manager,coach
and directors of the football club.2   
small iron gates let in the 100's of   
fans.An alleyway leads to a small hot- 
dog stand.Stone seats are placed next  
to the bright blue family box and next 
to the manager's seat.There is a small 
tunnel under the family steats leading 
to the players' changing rooms.Above   
the tunnel is the team's badge.
