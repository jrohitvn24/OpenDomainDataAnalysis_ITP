		<title>05    CHEWTON GLEN HOTEL</title>
		<content>    The Chewton Glen, one of the       
 leading hotels in the world, was built
 as a private house in the 1700's on 36
 acres of land. Now it has 44 rooms    
 (eleven suites and 33 bedrooms) named 
 after Captain Marryat's books or      
 people in them. This is because       
 Captain Marryat possibly wrote        
 "Children of the New Forest", one of  
 his books, there. In the Oak Room are 
 some priceless books. There are four  
 separate gardens, one of which belongs
 to the Lady Baker Suite. Altogether   
 the hotel has ninety staff including  
 sixteen cooks. Ninety people can fit  
 into the restaurant which is very     
 nice. Many famous people have stayed  
 there including Noel Edmunds, Terry   
 Wogan, Michael Aspel, Kevin Keegan and
 President Reagan's son. It could cost 
 Â£100 to stay for one night.
