		<title>03Sports in Winterbourne</title>
		<content> Many people play sports in            
 Winterbourne. Both football and       
 cricket are played and there is also a
 tennis club. Recently there was a     
 cricket match between Winterbourne and
 Gloucestershire county side to        
 celebrate the seventy fifth year of   
 the Winterbourne cricket club.        
 Gloucestershire won the match but it  
 was very close. It is not often that  
 people in Winterbourne see            
 professional cricketers as            
 Winterbourne is only an amateur side. 
 Many people play on the tennis courts 
 especially in the evenings. The       
 football club is very good they have a
 match every Saturday and Sunday and   
 many people watch the games. Sometimes
 the club organizes a fancy dress match
 and the spectators laugh and make     
 jokes about the players.
