		<content> The firm{Costains}was established in{ 
{1865}in{Crosby.} The firm became      
 larger and larger so that today it has
 over 15 branches in Britain and many  
 branches overseas.  The branch near to
 our school produces{window}and{door   
{frames}for their building section. The
 branch employs between 50 and 55      
 people such as joiners, plumbers and  
 labourers. We were shown round the    
 works by Mr.Cassels the manager, and  
 he told us that the working day there 
 is eight hours long with no shift     
 work. The firm uses many forms of     
 transport such as pick-up trucks, vans
 and flat waggons which are used to    
 carry their finished frames. The      
 Fazakerley branch is about 15-20 acres
 in size and includes a carpentry shop,
 a storage depot, and a maintenance    
 garage.
