		<content> We are in the open countryside so we  
 have no tower blocks, large hotels, or
 any flats at all. Most houses or      
 bungalows are detached, and stand on  
 their own piece of land, with no very 
 near neighbours.In the village        
 itself are some semi _ detached       
 houses,but almost all of these have   
 large gardens. A large number of      
 people keep hens. All houses and      
 bungalows are of red brick and tile   
 apart from a very few timber          
 bungalows.A fair number of properties 
 have an Agricultural Habitation Clause
 on them,which means you have to be    
 employed on the land to live in       
 them.There is no mains drainage,so    
 everyone has a septic tank in the     
 garden.Some houses have solid fuel or 
 oil-fired central heating.There is no 
 gas.Sometimes,after a dry summer,     
 houses may subside.                   </content>
