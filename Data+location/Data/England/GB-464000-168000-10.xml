		<content> Mrs Merton lives at the Old Rectory.  
 She has a very big garden with lots of
 trees and flowers.  From May the      
 garden is open to the public and one  
 can also buy plants.  There are twelve
 acres of land.  At the front of the   
 house stand two stone lions.  There is
 a swimming pool, two ponds and a      
 tennis court.                         
 Three gardeners work there.  We saw   
 some beautiful dark velvet pansies and
 vegetable patches with lots of        
 potatoes.  The vegetables from the    
 gardens win lots of prizes at local   
 shows.
