		<content> .Because the hard had been built for  
 the fishermen they wanted to live     
 nearby but around 1800 the houses and 
 streets started to spread and so the  
 population grew.Until this time the   
 people had worshipped at{All Saints   
{Church}which is a mile and a quarter  
 from the town on the only road into   
 town. There were no cars and it was a 
 long way to walk to church.In 1836 a  
{Chapel of Ease}was built in the High  
 Street with the growing village around
 it.Over the years many things were    
 added to it, the Pews being made in   
 the shipyard. The gallery was later   
 added so that now,{St. James Church}as
 it now is, can seat about one hundred 
 more people than All Saints Church.   
 All Saints is still used particularly 
 for special occasions.
