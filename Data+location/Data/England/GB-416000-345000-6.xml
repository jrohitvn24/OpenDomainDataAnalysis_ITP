		<title>06Ashbourne as a Route Centre.</title>
		<content>    Ashbourne has been an important    
 route centre since the middle ages.The
 main London to Derby to Manchester    
 road went via Ashbourne.So did the    
 Sheffield to Lichfield and Birmingham 
 roads.Manchester from London went via 
 Buxton.This led to the{Market}being{  
 formed in the 13th century.           
   The present day traffic is heavy    
 goods going to the main cities and    
 construction traffic to Carsington    
 Reservoir.                            
   Ashbourne is also a tourist centre  
 for Dovedale and the Peak district,so 
 there are seasonal tourist coaches and
 cars.                                 
   Many residents are concerned about  
 the volume of traffic going through   
 Ashbourne.A{By-pass}has been proposed 
 but a decision has not yet been made  
 about the route it will take.
