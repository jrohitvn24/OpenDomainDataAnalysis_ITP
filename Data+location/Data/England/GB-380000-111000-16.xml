		<title>16SHILLINGSTONE BUILDINGS</title>
		<content> There are several 16c cottages in     
 Shillingstone,and a number of 17c     
 and 18c buildings.There is a 15c cross
 now much restored,and there was a     
 Tudor manor house ,burnt down in      
 1923.Many of the old cottages have    
 thatched roofs.                       
 The cider orchards have given way to  
 new buildings and the original        
 allotments to a council estate,now    
 mostly owner occupied.                
 At the hamlet of Fiddleford the DOE   
 are restoring the 12c manor house.The 
 Fiddleford Inn is a 13c building.     
 Child Okeford has a large number of   
 newly built bungalows,mainly occupied 
 by retired people.
