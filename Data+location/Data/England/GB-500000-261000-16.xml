      Although Riseley only has a      
 Co-op, Post Office, craft shop and the
 gallery it does have the benefit of   
 many mobile facilities.               
      There is no doctor's surgery in  
 the village which is served by two    
 practices - one in Kimbolton and one  
 in Sharnbrook.  A baby clinic visits  
 the village once a month as does      
 the Family Planning Clinic.           
      Fresh vegetables can be bought at
 the Post Office, and two stalls where 
 home grown produce is sold on a       
 regular basis as well as some keen    
 gardeners selling off their excess    
 produce at tables set outside their   
 gates.  These people generally trust  
 their fellow villagers to be honest   
 and drop their money in the box       
 provided.                             
                                       </content>
