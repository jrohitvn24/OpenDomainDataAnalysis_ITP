		<content> Leicester's Market is{typical of the  
{Midlands and North Country}and has    
 been held on the same site since the{ 
{Thirteenth Century.}The original      
 market was only held on Saturdays and 
 was known as the{Saturday Market;}    
 markets on other days were held on    
 different sites; today it is held on  
 every weekday on this site.           
 Originally only food was sold but     
 since the 1900's clothes and other    
 consumer goods could be bought. During
 the{early 1970's}an{indoor market}was 
 added to the site; at the same time   
 the{Fish Market}moved from Friar Lane 
 to the ground floor of the indoor     
 site. Today it is the{largest retail  
{market in the land}with{over 400      
{stalls}by acquirng trade from smaller 
 county markets eg Hallaton. The{Cattle
{Market}on Welford Road has recently   
 declined in importance.               </content>
