		<content>{                                      
    We went up on the{Itchen Bridge }  
 to look at the view of the{Old Docks.}
 They had lots of cranes and a         
 few boats. The{docks}are mostly used  
 for business. There was one part which
 was private. There was a boat in dock 
 but it was not as big as the Leopard  
 or the Dragon which transport you to  
 France.These two ships, until this    
 year sailed from Southampton.We saw a 
{grain store}behind the smaller boats' 
 funnel.It was a weird building that   
 was grey and had a strange top.We saw 
 the{Southampton Old Bowling Green,  } 
 which is the oldest in the world.When 
 we walked past the flower beds we saw{
{an historic building,part of the Old }
{Walls,}now a museum.We saw the old    
 church of St. Julien.Behind the church
 we found the Presbytery.Around the    
 corner was a garage,a snackbar &amp;a pub.</content>
