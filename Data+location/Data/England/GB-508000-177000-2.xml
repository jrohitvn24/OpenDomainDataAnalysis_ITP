		<content>  On a Monday morning I get up at 8.00 
 I go downstairs and my mum gives me my
 breakfast.For my breakfast I usally   
 have Rice Crispies.I get my bag ready 
 and go to school. I leave for school  
 at 8.30am.My dad takes my brother to  
 school by van but I have to walk.We   
 start the school with an assembly then
 we go to our classroom and have our   
 lessons.At 10.40 we have playtime,    
 I usally play had at playtime but     
 sometimes we just go around annoying  
 the boys by trying to put them off,   
 their game of football.We have dinner 
 at 12.00and we have last play at 2.30.
 We go home at 3.45.When I get home I  
 sit down and watch television for     
 about quarter of a hour.Then I go out 
 to play in the alley with Charlotte   
 Towell.We play in the alley for about 
 1 and a quarter hours and then go to  
 bed. By Clare Howcroft                </content>
