		<title>18Housing In Dentdale.</title>
		<content>   There are about 300 houses in       
 Dentdale,some of these are holiday    
 homes, sadly not lived in all the year
 round.Most of the houses are between  
 100 and 300 years old,being built of  
 local stone,like the dry stone walls  
 which surround them.The houses blend  
 into the natural beauty of the dale.  
   Although the houses look old from   
 the outside the insides contain all   
 modern amenities such as central      
 heating,flush toilets,bathrooms ,     
 electricity,hot and cold water.Gas has
 not been piped to Dent but most people
 burn coal on their fires.Comfort with 
 low beamed ceilings,antique           
 furnishings are all part of life here.
   There are just a handfull of pebbled
 dashed houses built before the        
 Yorkshire National Parks stepped      
 in.Other houses built in the          
 traditional style are being planned.  </content>
