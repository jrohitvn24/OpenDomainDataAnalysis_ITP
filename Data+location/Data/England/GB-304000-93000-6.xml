		<content> it in half.The people who did this    
 were paid by however many stacks they 
 did.The stacks had to be 2 feet tall  
 at least.Then we looked round the     
 quarry.We saw the canteen,labatory,   
 gravel tip,silt pond,sand             
 pile,concrete works,tar mixer,stone   
 dryer,cleaner,crusher &amp; sorter.Also we
 saw the lorry park,car park,weigh     
 bridge,turning place,first aid post,  
 office block,other car park &amp; loading 
 bay.Something else we saw was a hand  
 dug quarry which is now a tip.That is 
 about all we saw.Then we went to Mr.  
 Wests office and asked him some more  
 questions.The quarry is 77 years  old.
 And if you are wondering who Mr.West  
 is he is the manager of the quarry. It
 was a nice trip and very interesting.
