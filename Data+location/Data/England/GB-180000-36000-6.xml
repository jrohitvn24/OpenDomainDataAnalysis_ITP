		<title>06WORLD WAR 2 IN MYLOR</title>
		<content>   Mylor was a busy village in world   
 war 2.                                
   8 people were killed in a German    
 bombing raid on the main entrance road
 to Mylor.                             
   A row of five houses were demolished
 in another such raid.The houses were  
 bulldozed and now form the Lemon Arms 
 carpark.                              
   A stream running through the village
 centre was diverted to the main river 
 to provide the main river with a      
 greater flow to combat a possible     
 incendury attack.                     
   A jetty was built by the Church for 
 Motor Torpedo Boats to use in practise
 for the D-Day invasions.              
   A Polish P.O.W.camp was built on the
 Barton/Restonguet road.The Poles being
 Christians erected a cross on the site
 that can still be seen today.
