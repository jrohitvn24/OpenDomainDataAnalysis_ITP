		<content> The village of Saxon Street is thought
 to be so called because it was on a   
 Saxon raiding route.It is part of the 
 parish of Woodditton and has a        
 population of 210.In the village there
 is a public house,called The Reindeer,
 and a garage and filling station which
 also sells sweets and snacks.The      
 village shop, post office and         
 chapel are just outside this block.   
  A large proportion of houses in Saxon
 Street are Council owned.Many of the  
 older village houses are built in     
 clunch,a feature of many              
 buildings in this area.
