		<content>{Animals. } The cattle are mainly      
 Hereford/Friesian cross, being        
 fattened in Mad Brook and  River Worfe
 valleys.  There were also some Large  
 White/Landrace cross pigs.  In the    
 distance we saw some Suffolk sheep.   
   When the cattle are put in the yards
 for the winter, the farmers feed them 
 fodder beet, silage, beet pulp and    
 beet nuts. Hereford/Friesian and      
 Charolais cattle are kept.  When they 
 are heavy enough they are sold for    
 beef.                                 
   The small pigs are sold to make     
 pork, bacon and sausages. The big pigs
 stay out in the field, with arks for  
 shelter, and are fed on pig nuts.     
   The sheep are bought in the summer  
 and eat grass, but are given hay in   
 winter.                               
   Some racehorses are kept at Sutton  
 Maddock.                              </content>
