		<content>Our D block lies 15 miles S.W.of       
Stafford in the heart of the country.  
The largest village to locate on the   
map is Wheaton Aston.This is where our 
school is situated.Other villages in   
the block are Lapley and Longnor.The   
land surrounding these villages is     
fairly flat.Flat enough in fact to     
border onto an old airfield which is   
now farmed.The runways on the airfield 
still exist.                           
   Farming is the major factor which   
gives the area it's character and      
flavour.Crops such as barley,winter    
wheat,rape and the occasional field    
of potatoes and peas are grown by the  
famers.However the largest proportion  
of the land is used for grazing cattle 
and sheep.                             
  Within the block there are many      
buildings of interest and some         
indication of a Roman settlement.      </content>
