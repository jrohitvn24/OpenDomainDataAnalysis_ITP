		<content> The B.C.R.A. is the largest such      
institute in the world.It began in 1920
in the middle of Stoke.Pottery         
industries put money together to form  
the Association.There are 250 people   
working there,half of whom are         
scientists.Ceramics include sanitary   
ware,sewage pipes,bricks,tiles,light   
sockets,space-ship nozzles etc.Ceramic 
is a Greek word meaning clay.Now they  
are making new materials by adding     
chemicals intended for car engines     
because they can withstand great heat. 
They have found ways of reproducing    
coloured slide photographs on to plates
In their work for the government a     
material,zircoma, has been invented    
which is light enough to be used as    
armour clothing or on helicopters.
