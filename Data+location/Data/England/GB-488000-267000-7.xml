		<title>07A LEVEL CHOICES AT 16 PLUS</title>
		<content> Maths,Economics,and Geography was my  
 choice.I considered them to be a good 
 combination since each subject        
 involves mathematical processes which 
 I considered to be my strongest part  
 of school subjects.I was advised by   
 someone who had done this combination 
 that it provided a good balance       
 between fun and usefulness and it     
 would be beneficial for a business    
 job.The Economics helps to give an    
 insight into transactions and         
 decisions in the business world which 
 leads on to some ideas suggested      
 within Geography relating to peoples  
 decisions of settlements              
 ,communications etc.The Maths helps   
 considerably with the manipulation of 
 data and statistics for both subjects 
 and helps make comparisons somewhat   
 easier.
