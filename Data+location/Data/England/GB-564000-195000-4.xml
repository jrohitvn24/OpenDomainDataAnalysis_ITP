   Business is conducted by telephone. 
 Of the grain produced, large          
 quantities of wheat and barley are    
 used for feeding cattle. Some wheat is
 sent to London for breadmaking whilst 
 oats are bought for use as porridge.  
 Quantities of produce are exported.   
{Changes in the last ten years.        
   The greatest change was the         
 increased skill of the plant breeders,
 allied to the skill of the farmer     
 which together had increased the crop 
 yield by 20%.                         
   The fact the land could now be      
 irrigated has also increased the      
 yield. Machinery is available for this
 purpose.                              
   The Commom Market has effected      
 further change by encouraging         
 different crops, e.g. rape, the seed  
 of which is used for its oil.         </content>
