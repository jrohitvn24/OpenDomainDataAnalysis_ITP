		<content> There are l3 farms in the area,       
 covering 2,l72 acrea approximately.   
 The soil is rich though quite a lot of
 artificial fertiliser is used to      
 produce maximum results.  Most farms  
 grow some corn, 9 farms have sheep -  
 one of these being a sheep farm       
 only.Two farms produce milk, which is 
 collected by bulk tankers and taken to
 a factory where it is processed for   
 dried milk and chocolate.  Cattle     
 found in the area are mainly Hereford 
 and Friesian cross-breds, and are sold
 mainly in the markets of Hereford,    
 Worcester, Tenbury, and Ledbury.      
 After shearing, the wool  is sold, by 
 compulsion, to the British Wool       
 Marketing Board.
