		<content> The area covered includes parts of the
 Civil Parishes of Eckington, Defford, 
 Strensham and Hill Croome in the      
 County of Hereford and Worcester.     
 The area is divided up by the{M5      
 Motorway,{River Avon}and the main line
 railway from the north to the south   
 passing through. This makes travelling
 in the area difficult.                
 The land is{rural}and includes mixed  
 farms, grassland and commonland. The  
 amenities for the area are very poor, 
 there being no shops, post office,    
 schools or any kind of 'bus service.  
 There is little housing and what there
 is are isolated farmhouses or houses  
 in little groups.                     
 The{churches}at Strensham and Hill    
 Croome are both very old and isolated.
