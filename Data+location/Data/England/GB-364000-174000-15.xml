		<title>15An Elderly Kingswood Person.</title>
		<content>   This typical{elderly person}is 69   
 years old and she lives on the top    
 floor of a two storey block of{old    
{peoples' flats.}The flats are modern  
 but she complains that she is         
 disturbed by traffic noise from the   
 main road nearby. The{flat}possesses  
 only one gas wall heater which she    
 finds inadequate in winter. She enjoys
 living in the area because she can    
 visit her family who live nearby. She 
 enjoys listening to a{local radio     
 station during the day and watching   
{television}in the evening. She goes to
 bed at 2130. She is frightened to     
 leave her flat at night for fear of   
 being attacked. She spends a lot of   
 her{spare time}knitting and has       
 produced items for various charities  
 including appeals for{Mother Theresa  
 and{Ethiopian Famine Relief.
