		<title>16Stalyhill from Shaw Moor.</title>
		<content> Walking from Shuuts Lane recently     
 tarmaced by the Water Board, the land 
 on our right is covered by modern     
 brick houses built in the last 11     
 years. On the left is rough grazing   
 land with horses and cattle. The farms
 are stone built of the late 18th      
 century. At Ashton Hill Cross, the    
 ancient Roman road cuts across. Shaw  
 Moor &amp; Hobson Moor are important      
 watershedding for local water supply. 
 Land changes near Shaw Moor farm to   
 heathermoorland and whimberry. Grouse,
 Martins and Swifts flew over. We found
 an Emperor moth. Pylons buzzed        
 overhead. At Trig point (399m) we had 
 magnificient view of Copley           
 School,Stalybridge Celtic Football    
 Club, Eastwood(RSPB), Hyde Finefare,  
 Jodrell Bank Telescope and Walkerwood 
 and Millbrook reservoirs.
