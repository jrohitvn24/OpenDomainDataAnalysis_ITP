		<title>11A Mixed Farm</title>
		<content> La Maitrerie is a typical Jersey Farm.
 It covers 44 vergees (20 acres); with 
 a further 3O v'gees (13 acres) rented.
 45 head of Jersey cattle are kept and 
 cabbage, cauliflowers, potatoes and   
 kale are grown.  Land is also used for
 grazing and hay-making. Fields are    
 rotated so that soil does not become  
 exhausted and after a while each field
 is given over to grass to allow it to 
 rest. Fertilizers, lime and manure are
 also used. The cows' milk is sold to  
 the Dairy and most of the crops       
 grown exported to the U.K. 2 people   
 work on the farm all the year but 4-5 
 people are employed at busy times.    
 The machinery used includes milking   
 machines, tractors, sprayer, potato   
 harvester, ploughs, trailers and bulk 
 milk storage tank.  The herd of cattle
 and the crop growing are equally      
 important on this mixed farm.         </content>
