		<title>11Shopping in Woodhalls</title>
		<content> There are no shops in Woodhalls.      
 People living in the area are         
 dependent on a variety of mobile      
 services.Milk,newspapers and bread are
 delivered daily; the butcher, fish -  
 monger and greengrocer visit twice    
 weekly.There is also a mobile hair-   
 dresser who travels the area by car   
 and attends all the family, men, women
 and children.These tradesmen not only 
 provide the services of their trade,  
 they also purvey local news, a very   
 valuable service in such a scattered  
 community.                            
     Most people pay at least a weekly 
 visit to Okehampton or Hatherleigh for
 their other shopping needs.The market 
 at Hatherleigh is a meeting place as  
 well as a thriving shopping centre,   
 where home-made produce, as well as   
 livestock is bought and sold.
