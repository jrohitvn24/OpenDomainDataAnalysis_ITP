 Grange mentioned in the Domesday      
 Survey of 1085.                       
                                       
    There are thirty families living in
 the village. Some of the men work on  
 Berry farm and some work on the Duke's
 estate, but most men travel out of the
 village to work. Living in the village
 is the transport manager for          
 Unigate                               
 Dairies, the fuel oil manager for     
 South Western Farmers, the shop       
 manager for Harris's Bacon factory, a 
 milkman, a cafe owner, a timber yard  
 employee, and a policeman.            
    Some of the women are employed     
 in the farmhouse, and some at the     
 village school - a teacher, two dinner
 ladies, a secretary, and a caretaker.
