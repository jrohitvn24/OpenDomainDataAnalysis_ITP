		<content> Once an area of mixed farming, this is
 now an essentially arable land,       
 growing wheat, barley, oats, rape and 
 beans. There is some grazing of beef  
 cattle and a very few sheep and       
 intensively reared cattle but no dairy
 herds. There is one turkey farm in    
 Walkern and a pig farm in Ardeley.    
 Over one third of the land forms part 
 of the estate of a Walkern family     
 while about a quarter belongs to one  
 other farm. The remainder is divided  
 between about 7 farmers. Few people   
 now work the land: on one farm, 6 cope
 with about 770 acres and on another   
 one worker has replaced 6. A major    
 worry is cereal overproduction with   
 government stockpiling and it is      
 thought that a quota system may       
 eventually have to be considered. The 
 EEC is viewed ambivalently.
