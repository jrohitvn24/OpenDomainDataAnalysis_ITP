		<title>07THE BRANT BROUGHTON FESTIVAL</title>
		<content> In 1977 celebrations took place to    
 commemorate the Queen's Silver        
 Jubilee. From this event an annual    
 Festival developed which has continued
 up to the present. Until this year it 
 was held over the May Bank Holiday    
 Weekend and started with a procession 
 of decorated floats around the        
 village. Judging took place on the    
 village playing field where other     
 attractions were also held. No        
 procession of floats took place this  
 year and the date was also moved back 
 to June. A donkey derby was again held
 and a dog show also took place.       
 Between 800 and 1000 people normally  
 attend the show and in recent years   
 more people have been attracted from  
 outside the village. The Festival     
 itself is not a fund-raising event,   
 although village organisations can    
 erect stalls if they wish.            </content>
