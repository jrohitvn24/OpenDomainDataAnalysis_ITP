		<title>15ALL SAINTS CHURCH, BLAKENEY</title>
		<content>   This church is a 19th Century Gothic
 building of local forest stone. In    
 1877 Blakeney became a full parish,   
 having previously been part of Awre.  
 In 1936 it was reunited with Awre, and
 in 1982 Newnham was added and the     
 Blakeney vicarage was sold.           
   The villagers use the church for    
 marriages, baptisms and funerals but  
 there are only 41 on the electoral    
 roll and the congregation is small and
 ageing. The P.C.C. was unable to raise
 its Quota in 1984.                    
   The building is in a good state of  
 repair and decoration but the         
 churchyard is completely overgrown. An
 M.S.C. scheme will clear the          
 churchyard and restore the lych-gate  
 in 1986 and discussions are taking    
 place with the Awre Parish Council for
 the possible transfer of              
 responsibility for the churchyard.    </content>
