    The closure of the Andoversford    
 railway ststion took a long time for  
 people in Andoversford to get used    
 to.There were two railway stations-one
 was The Great Western Railway(GWR)and 
 the other was The Midland             
 Railway(MR).She travelled by train to 
 Cheltenham(6p return)-quite a lot.When
 the railway line and station closed   
 she came back on the last train.It was
 decorated with garlands of flowers and
 parties were held.                    
    She came to Andoversford because   
 her Mum and Dad were poorly.They used 
 to go to town on a horse drawn        
 carriage to go shopping.              
   When televisions were invented she  
 used to have a type of earphone called
 a crystal set.                        </content>
