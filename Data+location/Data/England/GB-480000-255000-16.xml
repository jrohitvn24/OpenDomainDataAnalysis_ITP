		<title>16 AN 8 YEAR OLD'S DAY</title>
		<content>For my Maths yesterday we did measuring
in metres and centimetres.I like doing 
that kind of Maths.At 12 o'clock we    
have lunch.I stay for packed           
lunches.For my packed lunch today I had
sandwiches,an apple and a chocolate    
biscuit.After lunch we have a long     
playtime.Amy and I carry on playing    
horses or snakes and dragons.We do art 
after play.I have done a writing       
pattern on the sheet with which we are 
going to make a teepee.Just before the 
Infants go home we have a story.At 20  
past 3 we do our Maths or Grammar.At   
10 to 4 the Juniors go home.           
After school I play with Amy.I also    
take Rozzilind my dog for a walk.At    
night I read a book and then I go to   
sleep at 9 o ' clock.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
