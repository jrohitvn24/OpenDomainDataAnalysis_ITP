 Most children liked living in the area
 but would have liked more friends to  
 play with.It is difficult to find     
 enough children of the same age group.
 There are very few amenities in the   
 area and children mainly go to        
 Royston,Buntingford and Stevenage when
 they go out.                          
 Cereals,Cornflakes and Weetabix,are   
 popular breakfasts with fish and chips
 being popular for main meals.         
 American made television series are   
 very popular and most children watch  
 over two hours of television a day.   
 Hobbies range from football and other 
 outdoor games to drawing and model    
 making.Some children go to            
 swimming,Judo and Brownies clubs.When
