		<content> The stone at  Rodburs lane is         
 called Chants man.                    
 The{story}is that back in the coaching
 day's Pye corner farm was an{inn.     
 One night the villagers decided to    
 play a trick on chant so they dressed 
 the stone in an overcoat and hat.On   
 leaving the{pub}a little merry he came
 to the top of the lane  and thought he
 saw a person standing there so he said
 good night to the person but received 
 no reply. He spoke again but still no 
 reply. After this he lost his temper  
 and fought the stone. He injured      
 himself so badly that he later died   
 from the injuries .                   
 The stone can still be seen today,    
 although at this time of year (summer)
 it is likely to be overgrown with     
 weeds and very difficult to find.
