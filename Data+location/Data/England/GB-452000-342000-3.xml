		<content>  At Saint Leodagarius Church,Church   
 Street, there is a pax stone, or      
 kissing stone.It is a piece of stone  
 built into the door frame.It was a    
 holy piece of stone. A Pope sent it.It
 was from a saint's tomb.The           
 congregation were supposed to kiss    
 it. Originally the people kissed      
 each other as a sign of neighbourly   
 love but when the congregation grew   
 they kissed the pax stone instead.    
  A surviving local custom is the      
 Basford Wakes. After Goose Fair the   
 local children go to a smaller        
 fun-fair on Billy Bacon's land near   
 Basford Crossing. The original site   
 was the Shoulder of Mutton car park,  
 now known as "Thingymajigs". Children 
 bring back presents from the Wakes and
 these are called 'fairings'.
