{  The G.L.C. Land Drainage and        
{Engineering Department}has been in New
 Malden since 1937; before 1964 it     
 belonged to Surrey County Council. 16 
 men work at the department; the job   
 has not attracted any girls. The men  
 work a 5 day week from 7am-4pm; they  
 work in two gangs. Each gang covers   
 the area from Streatham to Barnes     
 which includes the Rivers Beverley and
 Wandle. Grass cutting equipment and   
 drags  are used to keep the rivers and
 sewers clean. In areas where gas iss  
 expected breathing equipment is used. 
   There have never been any strikes at
 the department because the men are    
 strongly against them. The men are not
 yet sure whether or not they will     
 lose their jobs when the G.L.C. is    
 abolished.
