		<title>18A Day in My Life in Ingleton</title>
		<content> When I arrived home I had my tea which
 was egg, chips and baked beans. I     
 played out after tea playing football.
 We play in a gap between the houses   
 where there are no windows to break!  
 I came in home at about 7.00pm. I     
 played in the sitting room with my    
 remote controlled tank. At 8.00pm I   
 started to prepare for bed, I cleaned 
 my teeth and put on my pyjamas. I     
 watched a programme on the black and  
 white television set in my bedroom.   
 The television belongs to me and my   
 two sisters. At about 9.30pm I        
 switched off the television and put   
 out my light. It was about half an    
 hour before I fell asleep.            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
