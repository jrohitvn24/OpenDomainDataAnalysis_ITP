		<title>04Newton Aycliffe-Royal Visit</title>
		<content> The national significance of new towns
 and of Newton Aycliffe in particular  
 was marked by a Royal Visit in 1960.  
 Harry Bilton well-known local figure  
 recalls the occasion:                 
 "May 27th.1960 was a very happy day   
 for everyone in the new town.We had   
 been looking forward to the visit of  
 Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth and His   
 Royal Highness Prince Philip for some 
 time and the excitement in the town   
 was intense.                          
 Although I was employed by Aycliffe   
 Development Corporation,it was in my  
 capacity as part-time Clerk to the    
 Great Aycliffe Parish Council that I  
 was lucky enough to be presented to   
 Her Majesty and Prince Philip,at      
 Simpasture Playing Field.             
 I was so overawed by the occasion that
 I cannot recall the conversation but  
 it will live in my memory for ever."  </content>
