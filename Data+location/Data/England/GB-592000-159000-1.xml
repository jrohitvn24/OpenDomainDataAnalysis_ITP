		<title>01INTRODUCTION, LYNSTED</title>
		<content> The area includes parts of the        
 villages of Rodmersham, Norton &amp;      
 Doddington, &amp; is centred on Lynsted   
 village. The area is set in rural     
 Kent. It is dominated by fields of    
 cherries, hops &amp; sheep, &amp; is sparsely 
 populated though traditionally        
 travellers move into the area in      
 summer &amp; autumn. Recently there have  
 been population changes in the        
 village. The houses are no longer     
 homes for local workers but           
 by people who work outside the village
 some commuting many miles, or retired 
 people. They live in the village      
 because of its rural beauty and are   
 attracted by the timbered houses. This
 has led to less of a community life in
 the area though efforts are made by   
 the church and pub. The little post   
 office struggles to keep open &amp; the   
 local school is at a low ebb.         </content>
