		<title>09GOLDINGTON'S FARM.</title>
		<content>{Goldington's Farm:}Goldington's is one
 of the 2 manors of the area.It was    
 once owned by Thomas Clutterbuck.Peter
 Clutterbuck, his son, excavated a     
 Roman villa in the Chess valley below 
 the house.He found coins and          
 pottery.People say that a ghost is at 
 Goldington's.It is a headless butler. 
 His head was cut off by his jealous   
 master, many years ago.               
 And to this day, it is said that doors
 open and slam unaccountably.
