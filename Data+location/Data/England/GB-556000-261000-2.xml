		<title>02THE CHURCHES SWAFFAM PRIOR</title>
		<content> The most interesting part about       
 Swaffam Prior are the two churches.   
 Some people think that two sisters who
 could never get on built their own    
 churches. There were really two       
 parishes and each church was on the   
 edge of each parish. In 979 Byrunoth  
 of East Anglia gave a piece of land to
 the parish. In 1260 St Gyriac's church
 was started and in 1450 St Mary's was 
 built. In 1667 the two parishes were  
 reunited. In 1802 the parish decided  
 to rebuild St Gyriac's church and by  
 1807 it was complete. In more recent  
 years St Gyriacs has been redecorated 
 and is now used for plays, concerts   
 and art and craft displays. In 1983 a 
 porch was added to St Mary's church   
 and now in 1985 both churches retain  
 their full beauty.
