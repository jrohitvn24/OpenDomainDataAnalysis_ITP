		<title>08Tourism in Gunton Area</title>
		<content> Thousands visit Gunton Park each year,
many to fish in the privately-owned    
lake. Others visit the unique water    
powered sawmill now protected by the   
Norfolk Windmill Trust and Norfolk     
Industrial Archeology Society.         
 Gunton Church,built in 1769 by Robert 
Adam is maintained by the Redundant    
Churches Fund. Once the private chapel 
of the Gunton Estate, it is open to    
the public for viewing and for private 
services and concerts.                 
 The lakes are surrounded by park and  
woodland and attract many wild birds   
and animals. Visiting is restricted to 
protect the wild-life.                 
 The Tower, built in 1820, at the East 
entrance, offers fine views of the     
surrounding countryside and is open to 
the public on certain days.
