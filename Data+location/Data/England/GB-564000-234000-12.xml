		<title>12SHOPS IN GREAT SAMPFORD</title>
		<content> In Gt.Sampford the population is quite
 high.To cope with the problems of bare
 cupboardsthere is one shop called     
 Mace.This shop sells the necessary    
 everyday food.The Post Office sells   
 stamps,postcards,newspapers and       
 stationery.The garage also sells a few
 things.Mobile vans tour around the    
 district.For a big shopping spree you 
 have to go to bigger places such as   
 Saffron Walden,Cambridge,Haverhill or 
 Bishop Stortford.There are some shops 
 in Thaxted,a small town nearby.The    
 only shop in the village has new      
 owners.It only used to open for a     
 short period of time.Now it is open   
 for much longer.This will make        
 shopping much easier in the village.
