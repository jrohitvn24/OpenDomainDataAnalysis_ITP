		<content>  Acre upon acre of grassland and      
 crops dominate the area and so it     
 comes as no surprise that many of its 
 inhabitants are{farmers}and their     
 families, many of them continuing     
 a long family tradition.              
  However, a substantial proportion of 
 the population are{business people.   
 Obviously, this is a result of the    
 motorway which provides ready access  
 to towns and cities outside the area. 
  Several{school teachers}also live    
 within the area, although there are no
 schools!                              
  The collieries nearby and the fact   
 that there was once mining in the area
 accounts for the presence of existing 
 and retired{miners}within the         
 population.                           
  A number of estate cottages are      
 occupied by National Trust staff.
