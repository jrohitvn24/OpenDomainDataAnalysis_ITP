		<title>13BORDON RIVERS AND MILLS</title>
		<content>   Kingsley Mill uses water from the   
 Kingsley Stream which is a tributary  
 of the River Wey.   The Wey is a      
 scenic river  running through a       
 variety of landscapes including old   
 woodlands and hollow lanes until it   
 reaches the Thames. The River Wey     
 conservation area stretches for 5     
 miles going through Hammer Vale,      
 Bramshott, Passfield, Standford and   
 Headley Mill. Kingsley Mill ground    
 flour until 1916 and then ground horse
 fodder. Other mills in the area have  
 been used for making iron and paper.  
   Kingsley Mill has a very large      
 garden which is well kept with lovely 
 flowers and is well worth a visit.    
 Opposite the mill there are sandworks 
 and next to it is a golf course.The   
 area around is used for army training.
