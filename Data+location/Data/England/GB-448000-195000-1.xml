Abingdon,two distinct areas.The central
area being the ancient town and modern 
shopping precinct,and the southern area
comprising two large housing estates   
both predoninantly council owned.The   
River Thames cuts the block in half.The

buildings and customs and their        
importance today,also,the childrens
