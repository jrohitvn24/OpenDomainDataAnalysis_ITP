		<title>16Royal Residence at Clarendon</title>
		<content> The foundation of Clarendon Palace is 
 as obscure in the past as it is       
 obscure to the general public now. It 
 was built before the Norman Conquest. 
 It has had pugilist connections all   
 its history. Today all that remains of
 the once grand regal palace, on King  
 Manor Hill, is well hidden within the 
 forest. However with permission one   
 may still climb up the steep hill and 
 follow the barely discernable path,   
 round a corner and then suddenly to   
 meet a fallen wall. Looking round the 
 remains today is quite awesome as part
 of large banqueting halls struggle to 
 find identity with the weeds and      
 trees. The magnificence is still seen 
 when travellers come across the       
 preserved stairway, which may have    
 been a grand entrance.{The wall arch  
{remaining holds a carved masonry stone
{illustrating some of its history.     </content>
