		<content> A DAY IN MY LFE.  ALICE GLADWIN. 10.  
   At seven thirty in the morning my   
 clock radio wakes me up.  I then stay 
 in bed until eight o'clock.  Then I   
 get out of bed and get dressed.  I    
 like wearing dark clothes which       
 include skirt, blouse, thin tights and
 slip-on shoes.  I go downstairs and   
 eat my breakfast which is usually a   
 ceral called Weetabix.  It comes in a 
 yellow packet.  Then I go back        
 upstairs to the bathroom to brush my  
 teeth.  I return to get my coat and   
 glasses which I need to see clearly,  
 and then walk to school.  At school we
 hang our coats up in the cloakroom.   
 Girls are separate from boys.  Then we
 walk across the hall to our classroom.
  We work all morning apart from a     
 short break at 10.30.  I prefer a     
 packed lunch because I don't like the 
 school dinners provided.              </content>
