		<content>  The soils of the area are for the    
 most part medium to good in           
 quality.The plateau surface and the   
 higher slopes of the many river       
 valleys are used for agriculture,but  
 the lower slopes and valley bottoms   
 are often wooded.In some places the   
 slopes are too steep for cultivation  
 and are left as permanent pasture.    
  There are eight farms in our block   
 devoted to mixed farming with animals 
 predominating.Each has a flock of     
 sheep but the main income is from the 
 diary herds(Usually freisians) Barley 
 and wheat are grown for fodder and 2  
 cuts of silage or hay are taken each  
 year.Potatoes grow well in th area.   
  The farms are family run with sons   
 taking over from fathers when they    
 retire.                               
   There are a few commercial          
 plantations of mixed woodlands.       </content>
