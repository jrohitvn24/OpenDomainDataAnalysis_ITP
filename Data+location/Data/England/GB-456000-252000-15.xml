		<content> Preston Capes, Little Preston and the 
 surrounding area has a population of  
 2l5, which included 36 children and   
 approximately 30 persons who are of   
 pensionable age.                      
                                       
 Most people have to travel to their   
 place of work. Daventry, Northampton, 
 Banbury or even further afield. Mainly
 professional or managerial, they are  
 not usually of local origin. This has 
 forced property prices out of reach of
 first time buyers.
