		<title>10FRECKLETON CLUB DAY</title>
		<content>Freckleton Club Day originated with the
Freindly Societies who used to parade  
through the streets once a year as a   
 public relations excercise.Most soon  
it  developed into carnivals with      
decorated floats and bands and all the 
fun of the fair t became the one       
day in the year when the workers and   
their families whooped it up.In 1919,  
after the First World War,to celebrate 
the retern of peace,the churchs        
organised processions of witness       
followed by children's sports on the   
green but people still thought of it as
a "Club Day" and the name stuck.The    
church processions are much the same   
today,an act of witness when,menbers of
the Methodist Chapel,Roman Catholic    
Church and the Church of England walk  
in the morning.
