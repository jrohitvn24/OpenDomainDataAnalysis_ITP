		<title>12GROTON HALL FARM</title>
		<content>                                       
Most of the area around Boxford is     
farming land and we went to see one of 
the farms.  The farm we saw was called 
Groton Hall Farm.  Mr. Partridge is the
farmer and he has 250 acres of land.   
His crops are sugar beet, barley,      
wheat, peas and grass.  His farm is 500
years old.  The farm animals are pigs  
and sheep which are used for meat.     
Mr. Partridge has 5 tractors, ploughs, 
drills, combine rolls and a cultivator.
He has two ponds and a reservoir.  The 
farmhouse is called Groton Hall and the
land lies to one side of the house.    
Mr. Partridge said you need lots of    
patience to be a good farmer and he    
said that the busiest time of the year 
is at harvest and immediately after    
because you have to plant the next crop
ready for October.
