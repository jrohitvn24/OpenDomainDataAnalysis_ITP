    The A168 runs through this area    
 carrying heavy goods traffic to and   
 from Teeside and the North East.      
 Tanker traffic carrying chemicals from
 Teeside uses this road as it is the   
 main link road from the A1 at         
 Dishforth to the A19.  It by-passes   
 the town of Thirsk in the West. The   
 A19 has been greatly improved in      
 recent years so is a very popular     
 alternative to the A1 for those       
 travelling to and from Newcastle and  
 Teeside.                              
    A filling station and cafe is      
 situated near the turn off for Thirsk 
 convenient for North bound traffic.
