		<title>14 TRAFFIC PROBLEMS</title>
		<content>     Middleton Stoney is plagued by two
very busy roads which disrupt the      
tranquility of the village.The A43     
(Oxford-Northampton) is unsuitable for 
the heavy traffic which uses it.The    
proposed M40 linking Oxford with the   
Birmingham motorway system will run    
approximately 1km east of Middleton    
Stoney with access within 4km of the   
village.The residents have strongly    
backed the M40 during the planning     
period.                                
     The M40 may also alleviate traffic
between Bicester and the USAF base at  
Upper Heyford.The B4030 is very        
dangerouse for pedestrians and many    
accidents have resulted.               
     In time the village will revert to
a more quiet way of life.
