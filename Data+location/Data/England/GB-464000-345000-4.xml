		<title>04A LOWDHAM RESIDENT.</title>
		<content>   We interviewed a lady who is 96     
 years old this year.She has lived in  
 Lowdham since 1915.                   
   Her name is Ada and she has lived in
 the Leys for 26 years.Before that she 
 lived in Prospect Villas.             
   She told us many things about       
 herself and Lowdham.                  
   When she got home from school she   
 never went out to play.She was not    
 allowed!                              
   The shops in Lowdham were much      
 different,the Co-op used to be a tiny 
 cottage.                              
   She was married at Lowdham Church in
 1915 and rode through the village in a
 horse and trap.                       
   At the Queen's Coronation they held 
 a parade up and down the village.All  
 the children rode in a horse and cart.
