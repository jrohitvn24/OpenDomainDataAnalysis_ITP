		<title>12Myself- a boy called James.</title>
		<content>   My name is James. I was born in     
 Newcastle General Hospital in 1976.  I
 have brown hair and blue eyes and take
 size 3 in a shoe. My Dad is called    
 James, he is 38 years old and my Mam  
 is called Jean and is 36 years old. I 
 have aunties called June and Pat and  
 an uncle called George. My Grandad is 
 called Charles and my Grandma is      
 called Peggy.                         
   My favourite food is fish and chips.
 My favourite clothing is a track suit.
 My favourite subject at school is P.E.
 and I like doing project work and     
 Maths. I do not like History.         
   I have two pet budgies called Sparky
 and Billy. Sparky is 11 and we found  
 Billy in a garden so we do not know   
 how old he is. My Dad drives a car    
 called a Peugeot and I have a bike    
 called a Raleigh Striker.  My         
 favourite pop group is called Wham.   </content>
