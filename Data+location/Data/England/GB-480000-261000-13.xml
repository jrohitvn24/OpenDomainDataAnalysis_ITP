		<content>In the immediate area of Bellinge,     
Ecton Brook, Great and Little Billing  
there are many groups of churches      
represented. The oldest churches are   
the Anglican churches in Great Billing 
and Little Billing. The Roman Catholic 
church in Great Billing is not quite   
so old. In Little Billing the font is  
just over 1,000 years old.   The       
Methodists have a church in Great      
Billing and other church groups meet   
in Bellinge Community Centre. Although 
"church going" is not so popular these 
days each church has its regular       
worshippers.
