		<title>12Scotton/Northorpe; Religion</title>
		<content> The Rev Ian Stockton (married with    
 three young children) is priest in    
 charge at Scotton (St Genewys) and    
 Northorpe (St John); weekly Sunday    
 services are held in both villages: at
 Northorpe there are on average 8      
 communicants, at Scotton 30-35,       
 considerably more at Easter, Harvest  
 and Christmas. At Scotton members of  
 the Sunday School (30 children and 5  
 helpers) join in the second part of   
 the service after their meeting in the
 village hall. As Assistant Director of
 Training for Local Non Stipendiary    
 Ministry, Ian Stockton is keen to     
 build up the role of lay people in the
 ministry of the church and at St      
 Genewys the two churchwardens now take
 it in turn to assist at communion.    
 The last Methodist chapel in Scotton  
 closed in 1969, Northorpe has weekly  
 services at the chapel (av.7 present).</content>
