		<title>17E.Horsley S. Clubs</title>
		<content> A Good Neighbour scheme run by all the
 Churches covers the whole of E.Hors-  
 ley.  Newcomers are welcomed by a vol-
 untary road steward who provides a    
 leaflet giving details of the village 
 &amp; its activities &amp; inviting them to   
 the church of their choice.  He/she is
 also responsible for informing the    
 clergy of any births, sickness or     
 death, so that a visit can be made    
 and/or gift of flowers as appropriate.
                                       
 A Toddlers Club is run in St. Martin's
 Church Hall, and Girl Guides and      
 Brownies meet there.  E.Horsley Out-  
 door Bowling Club is surrounded by    
 small bungalows &amp; sheltered housing.  
 It is owned &amp; maintained by Guildford 
 Borough Council, who provided a very  
 pleasant club house in 1976 which it  
 rents to the Club.
