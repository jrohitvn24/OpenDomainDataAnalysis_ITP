		<title>07A Schoolday for Leah</title>
		<content> Every school day I wake up at 6.30    
 but I laze in bed for about an hour   
 watching breakfast time television.   
 Mum comes in and tells me to get      
 washed and dressed. I go downstairs   
 for breakfast. I usually have         
 cornflakes and cold milk.I brush my   
 teeth, put my coat on and pick up my  
 school bag. Now it is 8.43 and I am   
 ready for school. My Dad takes me to  
 my friend Suzy's house in his van on  
 his way to work in Bedford. He has his
 own printing firm. Sometimes he has to
 leave early because he may have an    
 emergency. My Mum has to take me to   
 school then. Suzy and I walk to school
 just before nine o'clock. We wait in  
 the playground until our teacher lets 
 us in. We have Assembly first.Then if 
 it is Monday we have news time. I like
 every day but Tuesday because then we 
 have some lessons I'm not keen on.    </content>
