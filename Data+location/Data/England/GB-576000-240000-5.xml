		<content>   There are some modern properties    
 interspersed between older and        
 established ones. Sometimes recent    
{development}has unfortunately not     
 taken sufficient account of the form  
 and traditional materials of existing 
 dwellings.{Planning controls}have     
 recently become stricter but this also
 causes some alarm as the{population}is
 growing older and it is thought that  
 only new cheaper housing will         
 encourage young families to continue  
 to live in the village. There are     
{strong feelings}for and against more  
 development. At present, 1985, there  
 is a move to build houses on a central
 plot next to the school.              
   Most houses have hot and cold       
 running water, bathrooms and indoor   
 toilets. A{sewerage system}for only   
 the centre of the village was built in
 1969, the year men landed on the moon.</content>
