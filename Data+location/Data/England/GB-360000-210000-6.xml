 THE SEAM IS FOUR FEET SIX AT THE      
 THINNEST POINT &amp; FIVE FEET SIX AT THE 
 WIDEST. ONCE THEY HAVE USED THE       
 EXPLOSIVES THEY BREAK UP THE COAL WITH
 PICK AXES. THERE IS A LOT OF FOOLS    
 GOLD IN THE COAL WHICH SHOWS IT IS    
 GOOD COAL. THE PIT PROPS CALLED COGS  
 ARE MADE OF WOOD. THEY ARE USED TO    
 HOLD UP THE ROOF OF THE MINE.         
                                       
 THE COAL IS BROUGHT OUT OF THE MINE IN
 DRAMS ON DRAM LINES. EACH DRAM CARRIES
 HALF A TON. TO MAKE THE DRAM RUN      
 SMOOTHLY OIL IS PUT ON THE REELS. ON  
 THE BACK OF THE DRAMS THERE IS A METAL
 ROD TO STOP THE DRAMS SLIDING BACK    
 DOWN THE MINE. THERE IS A SIGNAL TO   
 SAY WHEN THE DRAM COMES UP THE MINE;  
 ONE PULL FOR STOP, TWO FOR LOWER &amp;    
 THREE FOR RAISE. {CONT. PAGE 7... }   </content>
