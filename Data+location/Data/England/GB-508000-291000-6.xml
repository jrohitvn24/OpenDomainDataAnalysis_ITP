		<content> These are some of the games we have in
 the playground.The game "Tig on Lines"
 is played on the netball lines. One   
 person is "On" and he tries to chase  
 and touch everyone else on the net    
 ball lines.When he touches somebody   
 that person becomes "On".Another game 
 is Hopscotch.This is played on a grid 
 of squares from one to ten.A stone is 
 thrown onto square 1 and the person   
 jumps over number 1 on to number 2.If 
 the stone misses the square you miss a
 turn.Next time she throws on to number
 2 and jumps to 3, and so on up to ten.
 "British Bulldog" is a game where one 
 person tries to run to the other side 
 of the playground without being caught
 by the bogeyman in the middle.If he   
 makes it everyone can run across.
