		<title>19ATTITUDES - IDEN GREEN</title>
		<content>    Comments from our survey revealed  
 that although families in general     
 enjoy the privacy and quiet the area  
 offers for many there is a feeling of 
 caring and sharing. It operates on    
 many levels from neighbourly concern  
 to manning the voluntary services. In 
 a larger community this aid may come  
 from an official source. Here an      
 informal system of support extends    
 throughout all ages and is highly     
 valued. It ranges from taking people  
 by car for hospital treatment to      
 spring cleaning the Church.           
    Fund raising for the wide variety  
 of clubs and societies in the Parish  
 of which Iden Green is a part goes on 
 throughout the year. Many residents   
 are actively involved in this either  
 by running or supporting the coffee   
 mornings, jumble sales, discos and    
 fetes.                                </content>
