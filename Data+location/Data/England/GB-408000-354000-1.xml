		<title>01The Wetton and Grindon Area</title>
		<content>     On the east side of the deep and  
superbly beautiful Manifold Valley is  
Wetton - a compact stone village close 
to Wetton Mill and only a mile across  
the moors from Alstonefield.  All      
around is beautiful country-side.  A   
local beauty spot is Thor's Cave which 
is a vast cave that extends for over   
100 feet back into the hillside.       
     Wetton church was rebuilt in 1820 
but it retains its 14th century tower  
with its unusual external stair-turret 
to the belfry.                         
     To the west of the Manifold       
Grindon sits on the edge of the moor   
just before the land drops away into   
the steeply sided valley.  It has      
about 42 habitations, a 19th century   
church, a pub and a village hall.  It  
is a close knit community and the      
inhabitants are very concerned about   
the number of holiday cottages there.  </content>
