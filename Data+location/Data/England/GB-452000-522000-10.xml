 Air and Water Pollution               
                                       
 The pollution on Seal Sands can be    
 basically divided up into two         
 sections; firstly Air Pollution and   
 secondly Water Pollution.  Of the two,
 Air Pollution is probably the most    
 common.                               
 Air pollution is mostly caused by the 
 heating of furnaces which raises the  
 temperature in the various vessels on 
 all sites sufficiently to allow the   
 chemical processes to take place.  As 
 these furnaces are operated at maximum
 efficiency, combustion is incomplete  
 and so carbon monoxide is produced.   
 In addition to this, fuel oils which  
 are used to heat the furnaces contain 
 organic sulphides and mercaptans which
 upon combustion release, among others,
 the gases sulphur dioxide and sulphur </content>
