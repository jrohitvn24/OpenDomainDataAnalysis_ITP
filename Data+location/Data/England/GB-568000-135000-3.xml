		<title>03CHRIST CHURCH, KILNDOWN</title>
		<content>   The church was built in 1840,       
endowed mainly by Field Marshall,      
Viscount Beresford, of Bedgebury, one  
of Wellington's generals. It was       
changed over the next few years into   
an early and outstanding example of a  
Gothic Revival church, under the       
guidance of Alexander Beresford-Hope,  
a member of the Cambridge Camden       
Society, whose members believed that   
all churches should be built and       
furnished in the Gothic style.         
   There is a church service every     
Sunday morning, which the local        
Sunday School also attend. There is    
also a school service each Thursday of 
the term.                              
   Unfortunately, the organ is falling 
through the floor. The Organ Fund has  
raised 12,000 of the 14,000 pounds     
needed to rebuild it. Some of the pipes
were taken away on 4th. July.          </content>
