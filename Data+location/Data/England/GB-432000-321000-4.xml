		<title>04CHANGES IN THE VILLAGE</title>
		<content>  We had to go and look around the     
 village because the map we were using 
 is 30 years old, and there are some   
 things that aren't on the map, and the
 fields have changed.                  
  The fields are much bigger because   
 the hedges have been taken out. There 
 are a lot more houses and bungalows in
 the village. An old chapel has been   
 converted into a house. A footpath has
 been changed to come out into a street
 of new houses. It was difficult to    
 decide what had been growing in the   
 fields, but we remembered what colour 
 the fields had been.                  
  We have two pubs and a cricket pitch,
 and only two shops, one of which is   
 the Post Office as well. We only have 
 one bus that goes through the village 
 and some of us use it to come to      
 school.
