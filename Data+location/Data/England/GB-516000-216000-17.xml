		<title>17Churches,Ayot St.Lawrence</title>
		<content>{THE OLD CHURCH, }dedicated to St.     
 Lawrence, a Christian martyr, whose   
 heart,after his death,is said to have 
 been roasted on a grill in "Ayot      
 Manor",dates back to the 12thC. When  
 Sir Lyonel Lyde became Lord of the    
 Manor and built a new house,he decided
 to pull down the church as it spoilt  
 the view from his house.Everyone was  
 cross so Sir Lyonel had to stop.Now   
 the Ames family own it.It is in a     
 dangerous condition, so the gate is   
 kept padlocked.                       
{THE NEW CHURCH,}built by Sir Lyonel to
 look like a Greek Theatre, from his   
 house, has, on each side, a pavilion; 
 under one is Sir Lyonel's tomb and    
 under the other is his wife's. He is  
 supposed to have said that the church 
 made him live with his wife, but he   
 was not going to be near her when he  
 was dead!                             </content>
