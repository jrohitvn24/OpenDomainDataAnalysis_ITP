{                                      
    We interviewed a local resident who
 had lived in the area for forty years.
 She remarked on the changes that had  
 taken place. Trees had been cut down  
 for housing development and recreation
 land. The cost of living had risen in 
 the area because of the tourist trade 
 and an influx of industry. Many old   
 houses have been converted into flats 
 and prime sites have been taken over  
 by property developers giving way to  
 luxury flats and warden controlled    
 homes for the elderly. It is a        
 prosperous area.
