		<content> The Survey lies largely within the    
 Mendip Hills area of{Outstanding      
{Natural Beauty}as designated in{1972. 
 The block still retains in large      
 measure a very unspoiled character    
 despite the increasing pressure on our
 countryside and the rapid{increase}of 
{population}in North Somerset since    
 1961. The work carried out during the 
 Domesday Survey has shown a wide      
 variety of activity and land use but  
 has also reinforced the need to care  
 responsibly for our natural heritage  
 and Conservation work since World War 
 2 is paying dividends. People were    
 therefore,{'environmentally aware'}but
 still recognised the importance of    
 local jobs in a time of economic      
 recession even if those jobs are in an
{'environmentally destructive'}activity
 like quarrying.
