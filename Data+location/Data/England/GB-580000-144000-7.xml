		<title>07SETTLEMENT AROUND HEADCORN</title>
		<content>{The main area of settlement}is centred
 around Headcorn's ancient Parish      
 Church and the High Street. Here are  
 the older houses such as Shakespeare  
 House (1400),The Chantry (1466) and   
 Rushford Manor (1740.{Terraced        
{Victorian dwellings}occur in Oak Lane 
 and other detached houses of this     
 period are found widely. The rate of  
 growth in the village increased in the
{'60's and '70's}with the building of  
 large estates,both Council and        
 private. A few smaller and private    
 developments have occurred more       
{recently}and are considered to be     
 "infilling". Beyond the confines of   
 the village{scattered farm settlements
 and hamlets are common. Some of these 
 are{"dens",such as Tilden,Moatenden or
{Boarden}and are of Medieval origin.   
 The conversion of redundant farm      
 buildings appears to be growing.      </content>
