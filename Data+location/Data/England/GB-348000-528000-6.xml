		<title>06The changing face of Penrith</title>
		<content> There are plenty of interesting old   
 buildings including a 14th Century    
 castle for visitors to explore, but   
 the face of Penrith is changing.  the 
 old court yards with their narrow     
 enterances for easy defence during the
 borer raids are disappearing, as more 
 shops and office open in the town.  In
 spite of this enrith still keeps its  
 characte but the people of the town   
 are concerned as to what will happen  
 next.  big projects are being         
 discussed amongst the planners and the
 people of the town.  Two new shopping 
 precients are under discussion, but   
 the development, if it happens, will  
 take place behind the existing facade 
 of present buildings.  The feelings   
 about this are mixed, but some people 
 think that it is about time Penrith   
 advanced into the 20th Century.
