		<title>10Butley Then and Now - Review</title>
		<content>Butley has changed quite a lot during  
the last 100 years. We visited Butley  
on Tuesday 10 September 1985 and       
filled in a sheet about the different  
sorts of buildings in the village.     
Among the houses I put down on my sheet
were The Shop,The Forge and The Oyster 
Inn. On the front of the Oyster Inn the
front door has been moved and the small
window has been taken out and a bigger 
one has been put in its place. The old 
roads in Butley were old dirt tracks   
but now they are gravel and tar. The   
Priory has not changed as much as the  
other buildings. The Forge used to have
a big archway for the horses but now it
is a doorway. The Shop is now used for 
living in because it closed down 10    
years ago.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
