		<content>The Domesday survey was carried out by 
two classes of 3rd year children and   
two classes of 4th year children.Small 
parties of between 10 and 15 pupils    
were taken out either on foot or in the
school minibus and given various tasks 
of counting,interviewing and observing.
Amongst those people who helped us were
the Vicar of Horninglow, the Minister  
of St.Thomas's and Anslow Chapels, the 
heads of various schools, the hospital 
administrator, farmers and members of  
the childrens families.The survey was  
carried out over a period of six weeks.
The text was written, edited and fed   
into the computer by a group of 4th.   
year boys.Displays of written work,    
drawings, charts and maps which have   
been used in the survey are now on     
display in the school.
