		<content> In the last century and before, people
 lived on the{moors}rather than the    
 valley and this can be proved by the  
 farm and handloom weaving settlements 
 and the ancient pack roads still to be
 found.One such is the{Reddyshore Scout
 which was one of the first paved roads
 in our district.                      
    In 1790 came the toll road.This    
 toll road is now the secondary Calder-
 brook road.Then another toll road was 
 built in 1824 -this is the modern     
{A6033}from{Littleborough}to{Todmorden 
 In 1790 the{canal}was also constructed
 but, as a form of transport, died out 
 in the 1920's.The{railway,}which was  
 constructed in 1840, took most of the 
 canal's customers.The railway is still
 running through our valley today.We   
 can use it to get to Manchester and   
 Leeds -and then onwards.
