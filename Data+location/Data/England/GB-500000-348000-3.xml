		<title>03CRANWELL VILLAGE</title>
		<content> The village of Cranwell is situated   
 on the B1429 road five kilometres to  
 the north-west of Sleaford in the     
 county of Lincolnshire. The population
 of Cranwell village is about 920.     
 Number 2, 4 and 6 Old School Lane are 
 typical Lincolnshire cottages. Other  
 interesting buildings include a       
 farmhouse design at 19 College Road   
 and an elegant and secluded house at  
 12 Sleaford Road. The terraced houses 
 on North Road have pleasing textures  
 provided by coursed stone and clay    
 pantiles; these terraces also have    
 outbuildings.                         
 There are several modern  houses, most
 of which are situated on the new      
 housing estate.                       
 There is no public house in the       
 village, but there is an off-licence  
 and also a social club.
