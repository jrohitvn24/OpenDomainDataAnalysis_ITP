   On Saturday 15th June 1985 Hurst    
 Junior School had their annual summer 
 fete. There were lots of different    
 stalls. In the middle of the arena,   
 there was dancing. I had two goes on  
 'Bonk a Gonk' a game in which you have
 to throw a ball to displace articles  
 on a wall. The 3rd years had to do    
 three dances; "Wish me luck", "Kiss me
 good night" and "We'll meet again".   
 They also had stalls selling plants.  
 Joanna did a competition to choose    
 names for two dogs. After that Mr.    
 Whatley did the raffle which had six  
 prizes. The 1st a colour T.V., 2nd a  
 lounger. The 3rd prize was a camera,  
 4th coffee maker. The 5th prize was a 
 stereo music centre and the last was a
 food hamper. All together we raised   
 over Â£1000 for our school.            </content>
