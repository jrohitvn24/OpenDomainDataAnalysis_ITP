		<title>12Holy Trinity School Pond</title>
		<content> One morning there was a digger that   
 came to the school and dug a big hole.
 Then they put part of the pond in and 
 built a wall round it. The reason for 
 the pond to be there is for the       
 children to study wildlife and nature 
 in the pond. The men still had bricks 
 left so they made some seats. Then    
 water was put in. The children brought
 some lily leaves in with water snail  
 eggs and lots of nice plants. Later on
 another man came and put some small   
 stones in. A boy brought some         
 sticklebacks. We have some tadpoles to
 put in but we can't put them in yet   
 because the fish will eat them. The   
 fish have now produced young and there
 are pond skaters and other insects in 
 the pond.
