		<content>Trentham,mentioned in the original     
Domesday Book,lies at the southern edge
of the City of Stoke-on-Trent. It is   
located either side of the A34, London 
to Manchester main road,at its junction
with the A5035,Derby to Nottingham main
road. Closeby runs the M6 Motorway;    
junction 15 links the motorway with the
A34 and the City of Stoke-on-Trent.    
 The main function of the area today is
that of a dormitory suburb of the City 
of Stoke-on-Trent. Several new estates 
have been built in the last 25 years   
and many new houses are still under    
construction. Located in Trentham are  
Trentham  Gardens,the famous former    
home of the Duke of Sutherland.        
 Also located nearby is the Strongford 
Sewage Works which treats most of the  
sewage for the City of Stoke-on-Trent. 
 The area has three schools,two primary
and one high school.                   </content>
