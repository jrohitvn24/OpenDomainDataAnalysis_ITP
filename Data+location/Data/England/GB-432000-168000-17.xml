		<title>17Transport in Hungerford.</title>
		<content> A survey of the parents at our school 
 showed that about half work in        
 Hungerford,the other half travelling  
 to 15 other places,the furthest of    
 these being London,some 60 miles away.
   Most use a private car to travel to 
 and from their place of work although 
 many who work in Hungerford travel on 
 foot.The average time to travel to    
 work is 25 minutes.                   
   A traffic census taken by a mini    
 roundabout on the A4 on a Wednesday   
 afternoon gave us the following       
 information.Six hundred vehicles an   
 hour passed through Hungerford and of 
 these some 540 were cars.The rest were
 different kinds of transport.There    
 were 24 lorries,20 vans,20 motor      
 bikes,8 coaches,16 bicycles and       
 4 tractors.For the 30 minutes of the  
 count not one public transport bus was
 seen!                                 </content>
