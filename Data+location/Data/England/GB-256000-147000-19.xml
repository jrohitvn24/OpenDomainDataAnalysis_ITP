		<content>   The village is not very well served 
 by public transport.  The railway     
 comes no nearer than Barnstaple and to
 get to anywhere one has to go via     
 Exeter.  There is an hourly bus       
 service to Ilfracombe, and on Tuesdays
 and Fridays (Market days) there is a  
 bus to Barnstaple.                    
   Loverings Garage, in the village,   
 has a fleet of coaches available for  
 hire.  During the holiday season they 
 run trips to local beauty spots and a 
 weekly coach to Exeter and Plymouth.  
   The village also has a Community Car
 Service to enable people to keep      
 Hospital and Dental appointments.  A  
 phone number is manned each day to    
 book the transport.   The cost is     
 #1.75 return to Ilfracombe,#3 return  
 to Barnstaple and #15 return to       
 Exeter.  Spare seats may be taken for 
 any purpose at half fare.             </content>
