		<title>07Scrap Yard - Slaithwaite</title>
		<content> The{scrap yard}is on the road to      
 Slaithwaite,it is owned by the        
{Schofield}brothers. Before the scrap  
 yard was made it used to be a farm    
 haulage contractors.                  
 The scrap yard is rather unsightly    
 but it can only be seen from across   
 the valley.We were shown different    
 kinds of metal copper,iron,aluminium  
 ,steel,and lead .                     
                                       
 We saw a variety of scrap, there      
 was an old steam roller ,some engines 
 from things like tractors and electric
 motors. We were shown some old        
 printing type and plates.The metal    
 goes to places like Case tractors and 
 then can get sent back again as scrap.
 Other scrap is sent as far afield as  
{Spain}and{Japan}.In winter when       
 business is slack,Schofields contract 
 out their{snow ploughs}to the council.</content>
