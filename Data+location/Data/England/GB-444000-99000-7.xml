		<content>   This is a family business run by Mr.
 Leggett and his daughter Jane who also
 employ 3 full time and 5 occasional   
 workers.  The buildings are old farm  
 buildings rented from Mr. Drummond.   
 The firm has two trawlers, four small 
 boats, a van, expensive processing and
 freezing equipment, packaging machines
 and cold storage.  A wide range of oil
 fish and shellfish, some of which     
 bought in from local ports i.e. whelks
 mussels and frozen prawns, are sold   
 wholesale and through the retail shop.
 Clams are trawled for in Southampton  
 Water and a new way of processing and 
 marketing them has been devised, the  
 product having been passed safe for   
 consumption by government inspectors, 
 Mr. Leggett hopes to get a licence to 
 export them to America.  Sales have   
 increased and new tanks have been     
 installed for fresh lobsters and crabs</content>
