		<title>05Health in Eccleshall</title>
		<content> Many of the inhabitants of Eccleshall 
 are orientated towards fitness,       
 judging by the number of sporting     
 clubs available. There is enthusiastic
 support at evening classes in pop-    
 mobility and yoga, one teacher of the 
 latter being 86 years old. Riding and 
 jogging also have a steady following  
 and there is a growing interest in    
 marathon running. The town is well    
 provided for the treatment of ailments
 by two doctor's surgeries, one of     
 which is a joint practice; and by a   
 dentist, a dispensing optician, and an
 osteopath.  A new clinic has been     
 built which is served by two midwives 
 who give mothercraft lessons, and a   
 visiting chiropodist, speech therapist
 and psychologist.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
