 When we moved to Fishbourne about ten 
 years ago a lot of new houses were    
 being built which meant lots of       
 children were able to play on the     
 road.But since then, things have      
{changed}and we get{complaints}about   
 being noisy.But the only place we can 
 play is the{playing field.}But alot of
 children are not allowed to go        
 there,and the farmers have closed off 
 their fields.There is one place where 
 we could play which is{The Creek}but  
 with the {A27}which you have to cross,
 a lot of children are not allowed to  
 go there.Fishbourne is becoming  a {  
{retirment}area now.But the children   
 who live there still have quite a lot 
 of fun and  during our childhood  we  
 would not like to move away.
