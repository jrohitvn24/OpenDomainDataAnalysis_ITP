		<content> Great Park Farm is the largest farm   
 in the area and it is an{arable}farm. 
 It grows{wheat, barley and oilseed    
{rape.}The farm covers an area of 530  
 hectares and it comprises of very     
 large fields, which were made by      
 cutting down the hedges that once grew
 around the fields.This was done so    
 that the farm would produce more crops
 and the agricultural machinery would  
 be able to operate more efficiently.In
 order to create a larger farm three   
 other farms were taken over about     
 fifteen years ago.Today the two       
 hundred year old farmhouse and its    
 farm buildings stand alone in a       
 landscape which is a sea of huge      
 fields.The farm needs only four men to
 work it.
