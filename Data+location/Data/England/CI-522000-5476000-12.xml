		<title>12      FORT PERZERIES</title>
		<content> Fort Perzeries was built to provide   
 against possible landing in the       
 southern  half of Rocquaine Bay and in
 1680 two 3 1/2 inch  cannons called   
 sakers were mounted there.The British 
 War Office handed the Fort over to the
 States of{Guernsey}in 1848. During    
 the occupation a small garrison of    
 Germans were stationed there. In 1981 
 excavations revealed  the original    
 17th. century  gun platform and       
 restoration work was carried out on   
 the walls. There is a gun battery on  
 top of Les Pezeries which overlooks   
 the whole of Rocquaine Bay stretching 
 across to L'Eree Bay.
