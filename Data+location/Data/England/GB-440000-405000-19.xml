		<title>19My Favourite Clothes.</title>
		<content> The clothes I like wearing best are my
 BMX top and BMX socks and black       
 trousers. On my feet I wear BMX       
 trainers. I got them from Barnsley. On
 the trainers is a black band. It says 
 "BMX" on the band, and the rest is    
 white.I wear these clothes on a Sunday
 when we go to the pub and if I am     
 invited to a party. Sometimes I wear  
 them for school.     {(Leon, aged 9)} 
                                       
 My favourite clothes are my jeans and 
 my pink T-shirt and my pink trainers  
 with blue and white stripes on them. I
 also like wearing my spotted dress and
 my blue shoes.My Mum only lets me wear
 my red sandals on special occasions   
 like weddings and Christenings. I have
 got a new jumper but it is too big for
 me so I cannot wear it yet.
