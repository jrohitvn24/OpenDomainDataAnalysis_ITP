		<title>11TREVELGUE HEAD</title>
		<content> Very little evidence remains to show  
 Trevelgue's true identity. There are  
 two barrows on the island and two more
 slightly north on the mainland. The   
 other visible remnants are the        
 ramparts. Trevelgue was very heavily  
 defended, traces of 9 are left, but 7 
 are clearly distinguishable.          
 Unfortunately, public foot-paths      
 criss-cross the ramparts and at these 
 points passageways have been worn     
 through them. No one so far has       
 considered Trevelgue important enough 
 to excavate thoroughly, or to have it 
 protected from human erosion. This    
 kind of attack  is slowly but surely  
 destroying the visible remains of     
 Trevelgue. There is also a blow-hole  
 on the headland which is thought to   
 have been an iron mine. Iron deposits 
 can still be found.
