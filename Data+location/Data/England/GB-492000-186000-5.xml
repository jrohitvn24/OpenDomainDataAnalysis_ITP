		<title>05FARM LIFE</title>
		<content> We interviewed one of the farmers in  
 our area and asked him what life was  
 like on a modern farm.He was brought  
 up on a nearby farm(his father still  
 farms locally)so he has always lived  
 and farmed in this area.He gets up at 
 5am and works a seven day week.       
 He finds it rewarding working with    
 animals and misses the passing of the 
 working animals,but finds he has      
 enough vet. problems as it is.His     
 favourite animals are cows and his    
 least  favourite sheep as they are    
 "too much trouble"                    
 The biggest change he has encountered 
 is improvement in machinery  which has
 resulted in more                      
 efficiency...producing more produce as
 cheaply as possible.Machinery is very 
 expensive though,e.g.his combine      
 harvester cost Â£70 000.               
                                       </content>
