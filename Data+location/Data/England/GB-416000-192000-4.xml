		<content> Newburgh House was officially opened  
 in 1968.Themesdown Council started    
 expanding it in 1983.When it is       
 finished Wiltshire County Council will
 take over.There will then be a total  
 of 42 residences in two storeys,some  
 flats,some bedsitters.Newburgh House  
 is a  retirement home.You can only    
 live in it if you are a pensioner.The 
 residents are only allowed birds,not  
 cats or dogs.The oldest person in     
 1985 is Mrs Burt who is 93.In 1985    
 there are six men.All the rest of the 
 residents are women.They used to have 
 meals on wheels and will in the       
 future,when the expansion is          
 completed, hopefully in June 1985.
