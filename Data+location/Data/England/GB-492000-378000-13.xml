		<title>13MANOR FARM BRATTELBY</title>
		<content> Mr. and Mrs. Marris, Nicholas, Julian 
 and Caroline live on a farm in        
 Brattelby.  Nicholas works on the farm
 and is going to take his H.N.D. in    
 September.  The farm house is made out
 of stone and was built in 1850.  The  
 farm consists of 210 acres.  On the   
 farm they grow seven different types  
 of crops.  They sow winter wheat and  
 barley in October and the fields are  
 82 and 20 acres.  The spring barley   
 and sugarbeet is sown in March and the
 fields are 25 and 20 acres.  Oil seed 
 rape is sown in early September and   
 the field is 20 acres.  Sugarbeet has 
 to be sown in light soil 45cm. apart  
 with a special drill. They have 30    
 acres of grass land.  Potatoes are    
 sown in March to April in a 10 acre   
 field.  They sow grass and clover for 
 extra goodness because there is       
 calcium in clover.                    </content>
