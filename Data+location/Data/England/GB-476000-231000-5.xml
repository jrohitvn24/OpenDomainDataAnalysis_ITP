  Tales of Highway men are very        
popular. Robbing coaches began in the  
17th century in the reign of Charles   
II.Some robbers could not afford a     
horse so they robbed on foot. They were
called {Footpads}. Highway robbery     
became so common that the robbers would
advertise which coaches they were to   
rob, when they were going to rob them  
and how much they expected to gain.    
                                       
 An extremely ruthless robber in North 
Bucks was Dancer. He evaded arrest for 
several years but was eventually caught
and hanged at the crossroads north of  
Singleborough to ensure maximum        
publicity. Today this place is known as
Dancer's Grave.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
