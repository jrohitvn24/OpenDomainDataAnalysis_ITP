		<content> The villages of Hulcote and Salford   
 lie in the corner of South West       
 Bedfordshire twelve miles west of     
 Bedford and one mile from the busy M1 
 motorway and four and half miles from 
 the new city of Milton Keynes with its
 modern shopping complex.  The         
 villages are in an  agricultural      
 setting with several scattered farms, 
 gently undulating fields which are    
 intensively farmed in a variety of    
 ways, changing with the seasons,      
 likewise the pageant of colour.  In   
 spite of the increased road traffic in
 recent years this area remains a      
 comparatively peaceful corner of      
 England.  It is interesting to note   
 that these villages were mentioned in 
 the first Domesday Book and have      
 survived until the present by the     
 tenacity of the inhabitants.
