		<title>03Traffic survey</title>
		<content>The main road (30 mph zone) through    
Sywell goes from  Northampton          
to Kettering. We carried out a traffic 
survey to see how busy it was. Lorries 
are banned along the main road except  
for those that are delivering to the   
shop and the school. The morning is    
the busiest time of the day, with the  
greatest number of cars. The number of 
vehicles was counted in the morning,   
dinner time and in the afternoon. No   
tractors were seen though they often   
travel from farm to farm along this    
road and no buses were observed but    
United Counties run daily to Kettering,
Corby, Old and Northampton. Only three 
bikes were seen during the survey.     
Only eight pedestrians were seen at the
different survey times. Three were     
shopping and five were walking their   
dogs. People on horseback are usually a
common sight.                          </content>
