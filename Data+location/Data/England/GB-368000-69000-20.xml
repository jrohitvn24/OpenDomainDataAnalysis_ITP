		<title>20Ferreting</title>
		<content> Not many people on the Island go      
 ferreting any more but those who do   
 usually go down the quarries or the   
 bramble bushes.  The people normally  
 take dogs as well as their ferrets    
 because if the ferret decides that he 
 wants to stay down the bunny hole and 
 eat it then the dog has to chase him  
 out.  The ferreters catch the bunnies 
 by putting nets over every burrow     
 which might contain a bunny.  Then    
 they send the ferret down one of the  
 holes and they wait to see what comes 
 out.  Sometimes the bunny jumps clean 
 over the net and when that happens    
 they send the dog chasing after it but
 they usually lose the bunny.
