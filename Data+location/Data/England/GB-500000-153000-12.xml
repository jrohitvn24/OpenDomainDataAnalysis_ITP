		<title>12THE MANOR HOUSE,SEND</title>
		<content> The old house was built in 1680. The  
 house has had lots of alterations     
 since it was first built. The front   
 door and porch in front of the house  
 has been moved towards the left and   
 the hall has been made larger. At the 
 side of the house there is a window   
 that has been blocked up with         
 bricks. This is because a long time   
 ago people who owned big houses had to
 pay taxes for their windows. The      
 bricks at the back are Victorian. The 
 front are mid 17th century. The roof  
 rafters inside the house are made of  
 oak. There have been many owners of   
 the Manor house. In 1845 the owner was
 Lord Lovelace's brother. Peter John   
 Locking. The next owner was Lucy Lloyd
 who lived there with her two sons.    
 The Bowerman family now live in the   
 Manor House. Mr. Bowerman is secretary
 of the local History Society.         </content>
