		<title>18A NORMAL DAY</title>
		<content> Every day I get dressed and go        
 downstairs to breakfast. Then I pack  
 my lunch and go to school. At the end 
 of school I go home and watch         
 television. On Thursday I do the same 
 things and after school I go to Judo. 
 On Wednesday afternoon I go to choir  
 practice with Stephanie and on        
 Thursday I go to ballet with Ruth. On 
 Friday I do the same as on Monday. On 
 Saturday I go and play with Mandy.    
 In the holidays I play with Felicity  
 and Caroline either on Rollerboots or 
 bicycles  amd sometimes Stephanie or  
 Mandy or Ruth comes round to play for 
 the day. These are only some of the   
 things I do in a normal week. I also  
 like reading.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
