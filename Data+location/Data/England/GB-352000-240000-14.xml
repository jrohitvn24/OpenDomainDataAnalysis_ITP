		<title>14HOUSING IN LUGWARDINE</title>
		<content>   Lugwardine means 'a mill near bright
 water' - a mill still stands at Lugg  
 Bridge. At Hemhill, several half-     
 timbered cottages date from the late  
 15th Century. Seventeen other houses  
 date from the 16th and 17th Centuries.
 Rock Farm is a fine example.          
   New Court and Lugwardine Court are  
 Georgian residences.                  
  When the Goodwin Tile Company was at 
 Hemhill in mid-Victorian time, it     
 brought prosperity and new buildings -
 Penkelly and Rowlands House date from 
 this period.                          
   In 1965, eight bungalows were built 
 at Court Close, and since 1971, 52    
 luxury bungalows and twelve houses    
 have been built at Traherne Close,    
 St Peter's Close and Hagley Orchard.  
 Property is expensive - prices from   
 Â£45 to Â£90,000. There is no Council   
 property and only seven rented houses.</content>
