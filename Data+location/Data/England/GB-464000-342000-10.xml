		<content>  Bulcote is a small village which is  
 attached to the North East tip of     
 Burton Joyce.Although it consists of  
 only approximately 70 houses,it has   
 its own identity and village          
 activities.                           
  We conducted a survey and half the   
 residents (approx) took part.         
  A lot of people have lived in Bulcote
 for more than 5yrs.Ten families have  
 lived in Bulcote less than this.Most  
 people go into Nottingham in cars,    
 eleven families get into town by bus. 
 Two people move around on             
 motorbikes.Twelve people get to work  
 in cars and one goes to work on a bus.
 No-one goes to work on the train.     
  Many people thought the public       
 transport system through Bulcote was  
 inadequate.
