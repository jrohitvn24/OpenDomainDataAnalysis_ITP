		<content> A branch of the Workers Educational   
 Association was started in Ashdon in  
 1972.About 20 people attended the     
 first open meeting and from this a    
 group was formed.The purpose is to    
 hold Educational classes for adults.  
 Usually two 12 week courses are       
 held each year-in the Autumn and the  
 Spring.The subjects are voted for and 
 the tutors usually come from          
 Cambridge, or the nearly villages.The 
 subjects studied have included music, 
 ,art,literature,local history,history 
 of London,Africa,China,America &amp; East 
 Anglian art &amp; literature.Each course  
 gives the students access to a wide   
 choice of specialized library books &amp; 
 if possible,outings relevant to the   
 course.The members vary according to  
 their personal interests,but the      
 classes usually consist of 20_24      
 members of mixed age &amp; sex.           </content>
