		<title>15AMBLE INDUSTRIAL ESTATE</title>
		<content>{Amble Industrial Estate}is located on 
 the{southern outskirts of the town}on 
 land which previously had been{open   
{fields.}The Estate was established in 
{1969}to attract{new industries}to the 
 town and{to create new jobs}in an area
 where{one in three}people are         
 at present{unemployed.}The Industrial 
 Site is situated between Alnwick and  
 Morpeth. It gives relatively easy     
{access}from the north to{Scotland}and 
 from the south to{Newcastle.}Until    
{1985}Amble was designated a{Special   
{Development Area}by the government,   
 but in recent months the town has{lost
{this status.}Coquet High School pupils
 made up a{questionnaire}to find out   
{why each factory was located in Amble.
 Employers chose the site basically    
 because they{could not get another    
 elsewhere and it was in a good place  
 for{trading in Northumberland.        </content>
