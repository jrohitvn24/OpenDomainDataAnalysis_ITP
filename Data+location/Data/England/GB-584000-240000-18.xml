		<title>18The Changing Scene</title>
		<content>  The centre of Sudbury has remained   
virtually unchanged for most of this   
century although a one-way traffic     
system introduced in the late 1960's   
made the Market Hill quieter and less  
prone to traffic congestion. Sudbury is
an old town which does not cope easily 
with the demands of modern living and  
two new developments designed to make  
life more pleasant have created        
controversy.                           
THE SUDBURY EASTERN BY-PASS- This new  
road was begun in early 1985 to relieve
the town of heavy through traffic. The 
road will join the A143 at the north   
west of the town to the A134 Colchester
road. The by-pass will increase traffic
on Springlands residential estate and  
will destroy some pleasant views.      
THE INDOOR SWIMMING POOL-This is a much
needed facility but is adjacent to the 
pleasant and peaceful water-meadows.   </content>
