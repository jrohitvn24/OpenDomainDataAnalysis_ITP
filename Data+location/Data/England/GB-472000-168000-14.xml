		<title>14ANIMAL &amp; GRASSLAND RESEARCH</title>
		<content> Part of the Animal and Grassland      
 Research Institute is situated at Hall
 Farm Arborfield.It is used for        
 research into cattle food and milk    
 production.In order to ensure that    
 each cow receives a cotrolled amount  
 of food each cow has its own feeding  
 box.Each box has a door which can only
 be opened by a magnetic key.Every cow 
 has its own key round its neck, which 
 can only open one door. One of the    
 most important developments which has 
 taken place at AGRIis the production  
 of clean milk i.e. milk which is free 
 from tubercolosis and bruscellosis.The
 Institute is also experimenting into  
 the production of methane from the    
 cows' waste product.The methane would 
 be liquified and used to power such   
 things as cars and various items of   
 machinery.                            
                                       </content>
