		<content> The area is an ornithological centre  
 important for ringing and studying    
 bird migration.Over 4000 birds are    
 ringed annually. Many species of wild 
 fowl visit or over winter on the lake.
 Several areas including Denny Island  
 are preserved as natural habitats for 
 warblers, swans,geese and ducks.There 
 are hides at Wick Green, Moreton Bank 
 and Nunnery Point,all of which are    
 extensively used by ornithologists.One
 hide was sponsored by Slimbridge Wild 
 Fowl Trust.Permits to use hides can be
 obtained from Woodford Lodge.100000 or
 more young trees have been planted in 
 the landscaping of the area and are   
 reaching maturity to give cover to the
 birds and outstanding beauty to the   
 area.Two picnic areas with fine views 
 are open to the public with toilets   
 and a shop.
