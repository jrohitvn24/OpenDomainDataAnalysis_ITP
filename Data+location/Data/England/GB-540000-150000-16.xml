		<content>  The building has been a Research     
 Department since 1969. Before that it 
 was a convalescent home attached to   
 Charing Cross Hospital, and was then a
 home for retired seamen.              
  The building houses 18 scientists and
 researchers working on various aspects
 of{cancer research.}The funding for   
 this department is purely voluntary,  
 coming from the{Marie Curie Memorial  
{Foundation,}which owns 11 homes with a
 total of 430 beds for cancer patients.
  The Foundation has its headquarters  
 in Belgrave Square, London. The main  
 objective of the Foundation is to     
 provide in-patient and domicilary     
 skilled nursing care for cancer       
 patients, councelling, advice and     
 immediate welfare needs in kind, and  
 professional and lay education in the 
 field of patient care.
