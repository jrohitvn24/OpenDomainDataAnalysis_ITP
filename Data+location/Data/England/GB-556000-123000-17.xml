		<title>17DISADVANTAGES OF RURAL LIFE</title>
		<content> OUR SURVEY SHOWS THE MAIN DISADVANTAGE
 OF LIVING HERE TO BE THE LACK OF      
{PUBLIC TRANSPORT.}THEREFORE PEOPLE    
 DEPEND ON THEIR OWN CARS AND OFTEN    
 REQUIRE MORE THAN ONE PER FAMILY.     
 TUNBRIDGE WELLS, THE MAIN{RAILWAY     
 STATION TO LONDON IS 15 MILES AWAY.   
 BUXTED,THE NEAREST STATION, GIVES     
 A POOR SERVICE AND DOES NOT GO ANY    
 FURTHER SOUTH THAN UCKFIELD.A POOR{BUS
{SERVICE}RUNS IRREGULARLY, WITH NO     
 EVENING OR SUNDAY SERVICE. THERE IS   
 ONLY ONE BUS ROUTE RUNNING FROM       
 HEATHFIELD TO TUNBRIDGE WELLS.{WINTER 
{TRAVELLING}IS DIFFICULT AS TRACKS TO  
 ISOLATED HOUSES BECOME IMPASSABLE.MORE
 LIBRARIES, SPORTS AND OTHER{FACILITIES
 ARE IN GREAT NEED. LOCAL SHOPS ARE    
 EXPENSIVE AND CANNOT COMPETE WITH THE 
 INCREASING NUMBER OF{SHOPPING}CENTRES 
 WHICH PROVIDE CHEAPER FOOD AND OTHER  
 COMMODITIES AND PARKING UNDER ONE ROOF</content>
