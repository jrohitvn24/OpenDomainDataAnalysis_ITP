		<title>12COMMUNITY POLICING</title>
		<content> This area is served from the Totton   
 police station,built in 1968.There are
 about 60 policemen ,4 policewomen ,one
 for each shift,no police horses or dog
 handlers.Photographers and other      
 specialists are drawn from the whole  
 Hampshire area.It is a mixed area to  
 police,most problems involve juvenile 
 offenders in petty crimes,especially  
 shoplifting.There are several police  
 vehicles but,many use bicycles as they
 enable the policeman to be approached 
 easily by the public,yet are faster   
 than walking.There is a community     
 policing policy for the area meaning  
 that the same police are in the area. 
 Much effort is put into improving     
 public relations,eg.P.C Fenner has    
 the job of liasing with and talking to
 schools.The motorway is policed by    
 specialists in fast cars from the     
 Lyndhurst police station.             </content>
