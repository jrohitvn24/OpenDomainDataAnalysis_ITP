		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO OUR BLOCK.</title>
		<content>The block is situated at the south side
of a small town,Chorley,within easy    
reach of a comprehensive motorway      
system.Our block contains open spaces  
for farming and recreation. Houses are 
mixed residential,with some small units
for industry and commerce. New building
is taking place to replace old houses  
and shops and update facilities.People 
within this area take an active part in
all aspects of Sport and the Arts.Many 
interesting people have offered us     
valuable information,and good use has  
been made of the local media.Children  
have explored their locality and are   
now more aware of the Geography,Ecology
and People within their Enviroment.The 
work that people are employed in and   
the games children play are all        
included. Folk customs play a part in  
our lives,as does a healthy commitment 
to the various Christian Denominations.</content>
