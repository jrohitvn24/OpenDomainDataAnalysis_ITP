		<title>06Fernden Fencing</title>
		<content> The fences are made of{sweet chestnut 
 wood.  They use that wood because it's
 easy to split into poles. The trees   
 have to be{12 yrs old}before they are 
 made into fences.  The lowest fence   
 is 1m and the highest is 2m. The      
 fences are mostly used on building    
 sites, parks and as temporary fencing.
 It{costs Â£1.65 a yard and Â£16.50 for  
 10 yards (9m). They used to have      
{transport}of their own but now they   
 hire it to{deliver}the fences.  They  
 have 75mm spaces between the  poles   
 and they are held together with       
 wire.  They use a compressed-air      
 staple-gun to fix the twisted wire to 
 the wood. The people{sell}lots of     
 fences in their area, and the nearest 
 fence-maker to them is in Pembury.    
 Now that more{conifers}are being      
 planted close by, they need to get    
 more of their wood from further away. </content>
