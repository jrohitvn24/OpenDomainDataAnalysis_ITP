		<title>16 Employment in Wellow</title>
		<content>West Wellow was originally a farming   
community,but recently has developed   
into a commuting population.Most people
work in Southampton,Winchester,        
Eastleigh or Romsey travelling there by
car as there are no efficient bus      
services.We found few manual workers,  
many office workers,mostly employed by 
local Government.                      
  Apart from rural industries(farms and
nurseries)West Wellow contains many    
small businesses,mainly building and   
engineering firms.These rarely employ  
more than two people,often local part- 
time workers.Few full-time workers live
in Wellow.The main employer was Wrenway
Engineering,which employs fourteen men 
of varied ages,most of whom are skilled
workers.Only two of these men live     
locally.This firm re-builds and makes  
tobacco machines for export.
