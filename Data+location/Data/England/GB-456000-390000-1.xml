		<title>01A Review of our Area</title>
		<content> Our area is mostly{farmland}and the   
 fields merge to create Nature's own   
 patchwork quilt. Many of the farmers  
 have uprooted hedges,thus forming     
 larger fields.The whole panorama is   
 dotted with farms and in the distance 
 we can see the woodlands of{Sandbeck  
{Estate.Lord Scarbrough}used to own    
 most of the land,and although he has  
 sold many acres,he retains a large    
 proportion.Interesting features in our
 area include the{Friary,Sandbeck Hall,
 the{Milldam}and the remains of the{   
{Castle.}The{Friary}is a private home; 
 it incorporates a 13th century lancet 
 window and other masonry from the     
 original Friary,which housed friars   
 until 1538.Locals and visitors find   
 the{Milldam}an attraction.They feed   
 the ducks,sail radio controlled boats 
 or just simply relax and enjoy the    
 scenery.                              </content>
