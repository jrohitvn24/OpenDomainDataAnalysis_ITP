		<title>10Tourism in Canterbury</title>
		<content>   Tourism is Canterbury's main        
 attraction. The{shops,}hotels, and    
 restaurants depend on tourists. Last  
 year 2-2.5 million people went there, 
 many of these from the USA and parts  
 of the continent. Many came from other
 parts of Britain. The main attraction 
 is the{Cathedral,}because of the      
 stained glass windows, Norman crypt,  
 and also because it is called the     
 cradle of Christianity.There are other
 buildings such as Grey Friars, the    
 Dominican Priory and Black Friars.    
 Others include 2 small{museums}-      
 Westgate garden and the Dane John     
 mound (a saxon burial place).         
   Tourists love the old mediaeval     
 houses, the Roman City Wall, the      
 shops, and trips along the river.     
   A guest house or{hotel}can range in 
 price from Â£62.50 per night for a     
 hotel to Â£19.00 for a guest house.    </content>
