		<content>   Machinery is also used in the       
 dairy,giving the farmer a quicker and 
 more profitable way of getting        
 milk.There is now a machine that tests
 each individual cows milk so the      
 farmer can decide which are the best  
 cows to keep.                         
   The only main problem the farmers   
 have are conservationists.They get    
 upset when farmers pull down hedges   
 and trees so as to fit large machines 
 into his fields or expand his area.   
  So farmers do not lead an easy       
 life,either getting money and         
 upsetting conservationists or losing  
 money and becoming a conservationist.
