		<title>17Basketry Classes</title>
		<content> Mrs. Harding took up basketry 11 years
 ago. She learnt the craft at The      
 Country Centre in Cambridge and first 
 did it purely as a hobby.             
 Then she started a basketry group in  
  Fen Ditton Church Hall on Thursdays  
 from 2.00 to 4.30.                    
 The people who come are mainly women  
 who no longer have young children.    
 Several of the members are            
 grandmothers. Some of the members pick
 up the skills quickly, others take    
 quite a long time.                    
 The group use rushes to make table    
 mats and willow to make               
 baskets.The baskets may be made for   
 carrying logs, apples or eggs and very
 small ones are made for salt cellars  
 and pepper pots.They buy the materials
 already prepared for use.They only    
 need three tools,secateurs, a sharp   
 spike and a Stanley knife.            </content>
