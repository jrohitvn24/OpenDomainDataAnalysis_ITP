    Off Ground It   The object of this 
game is someone has to be "it" and the 
other people have to run to somewhere  
that is off the ground but if you get  
touched by the person who is "it" you  
will have to take your turn at catching
the others.You can play as long as you 
like.                                  
                                       
    Spot Ball  Spot ball is a game when
one person has a ball and he has to hit
the other people in the game with the  
ball.It is fun for the people who are  
not throwing the ball to roll and jump 
while dodging the ball.Everyone except 
the person with the ball must not stand
up.
