		<content>      I have a{ZX Spectrum plus        
 computer which has a{48k memory}and it
 is very good. Before I got the plus I 
 had an ordinary Spectrum with a 48k   
 memory (the only difference is the    
 keyboard) but a boy called Stuart Burt
 broke it. We took it to{WH Smiths}to  
 be mended, but they had to send it to 
{Sinclair Research Ltd.}On the way they
 lost it so they gave us our plus.There
 are plenty of{games for the plus.}My  
 favourite is called{Transversion.}In  
 the game you are the captain of a     
{space ship}called Eliminax.You have to
 fly the ship around the screen{zapping
{alien pods}with your{lasers.}There are
 150 screens and I have got onto screen
 67.My nextdoor neighbours have a{Texas
{Instruments}computer. I'm not sure    
 how much memory it has. They are the  
 only two computers in our road on     
 the 21st June, 1985.                  </content>
