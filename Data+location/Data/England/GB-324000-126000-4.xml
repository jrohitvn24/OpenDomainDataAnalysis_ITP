		<title>04HESTERCOMBE HOUSE</title>
		<content> The beautiful gardens of this Georgian
 house were designed in 1902 by Edwin  
 Lutyens.1 part &amp; 2 full_time gardeners
 keep them looking immaculate.Many of  
 the original flowers still grow there.
 People who work there can use the     
 tennis, croquet and golf facilities.  
 The Orange Room has been set aside for
 information on the House's history.For
 example,you can find out why the Amer-
 ican soldiers made huts in the woods. 
 The House grew too expensive for the  
 Portman family to maintain so Somerset
 C.C.took it over for use by the fire  
 brigade.                              
 On average,12 calls a day come in.They
 are put on file.The firemen must react
 to a call in less than two minutes.3  
 or 4 men must be on duty at all times.
  The House is open to visitors Tues-  
 days,Wednesdays and Thursdays between 
 12 &amp; 8pm.                             </content>
