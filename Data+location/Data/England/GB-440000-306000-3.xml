		<title>03ALL SAINTS CHURCH</title>
		<content>{All Saints Church}stands on the south 
 side of the village on what was once  
 the green. The church dates from the  
 thirteenth century, the oldest        
 remaining part being the{chancel.}    
 Originally the congregation would have
 stood near the chancel arch. Seating  
 was probably provided in the fifteenth
 century, then box pews were added in  
 the seventeenth century. The{Royal    
{Coat of Arms}above the door has been  
 there since Henry VIII's reign, the   
 present one since the eighteenth      
 century. The church{organ}was given by
 Earl Howe in 1844. The stained{glass  
{window}in the south wall was given by 
 Samuel Knowles, a local farmer. The   
 lectern was given the Rector in 1885  
 by his own children. The church was   
 extensively restored in 1853 at a cost
 of Â£1,650, one of many alterations by 
 successive generations.               </content>
