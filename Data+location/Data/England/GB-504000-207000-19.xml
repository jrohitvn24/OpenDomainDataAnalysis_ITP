		<title>19QUEEN'S SQUARE, HEMEL</title>
		<content>    Queen's Square is a{neighbourhood  
{shopping centre,}serving the area of  
 Adeyfield, set up by the New Towns    
 Commission. It was designed as an     
 Italian Piazza and was opened in 1953.
 It contains shops, community centre,  
 library, church (with an unfinished   
 tower) and pub. There are flats over  
 the shops. The square is now a car    
 park, without a fountain! The square  
 is in a rather run down state with    
 much graffiti.                        
    Easy{parking}draws outsiders to the
 restaurant and hot snacks sold in the 
 bakery at lunch time. Shops include   
 several food shops, hardware,         
 confectioners, Post Office, betting   
 shop, off licence and electrical shop.
   The square is used by many{local    
{people,}but car owners prefer to shop 
 in the Marlowes, Hemel or Watford or  
 Brent Cross for larger items.         </content>
