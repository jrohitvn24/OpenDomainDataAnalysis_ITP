		<content> The Butser Fun Run.                   
 Sponsored running has recently become 
 very popular and in 1985 the 8th      
 Butser Fun Run took place. The course 
 is 4.5 miles long and is run over one 
 of the highest parts of the South     
 Downs. It is very gruelling with some 
 of the gradients being 1 in 5 with    
 ascents totalling 1000 feet. There    
 were 1050 entrants this year from a   
 wide variety of backgrounds, local    
 athletes,family groups, members of the
 forces, public house teams and        
 individuals. The ages range from 11_69
 years. There is a shorter, less severe
 course for those under 17. For some,  
 the aim is to win. For others, just to
 finish the course will suffice. During
 the last seven years Â£66,000 has been 
 raised for charity.The 1985 charities 
 include RNLI,Cheshire Homes and the   
 Arthritis and Rheumatism Council.     </content>
