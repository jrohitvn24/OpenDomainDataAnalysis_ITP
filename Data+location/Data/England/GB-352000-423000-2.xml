Lostock Hall to find out where they    
worked their jobs and how they         
travelled to work. The sample

of males  and 30% of women do not      
work. One feature of the survey was    
that over 80% of the people travel     
outside Lostock Hall to work. The      
majority of these, 55% to nearby       
Preston.  Those in work have a variety 
of employments with 40% having factory 
jobs, 25% in the service area. Less    
than 10% now work on the land. Apart
