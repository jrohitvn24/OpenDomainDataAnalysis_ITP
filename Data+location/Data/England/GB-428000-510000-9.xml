		<title>09William Emerson of Hurworth.</title>
		<content> William Emerson was born in 1701. He  
 was a mathematician and married the   
 niece of the rector.The dowry was not 
 paid so William took all of his wifes 
 belongings, put them all in a wheel-  
 barrow and dumped them on the rectors 
 doorstep.Some people saw him as a     
 magician because he knew a lot about  
 the stars.He had a friend called John 
 Hunter who was a brick layer.His      
 favourite words were "thou fule thou".
 One day some professors went to his   
 house to see if he could solve a      
 problem.He gave it to John Hunter who 
 did the sums on Williams hat. The     
 professors were not satisfied because 
 William did not look at it so they    
 asked him to check it.He said it was  
 perfectly right.William did not care  
 how he dressed, his wigs were dirty   
 and waistcoat buttoned at top and     
 bottom only.He died in 1782.          </content>
