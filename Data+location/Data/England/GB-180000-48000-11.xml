		<content> Mr.&amp; Mrs.C. moved from Surrey 6 months
 ago,to Ventontrissick,an attractive   
 timber-built house which replaced an  
 old fire-damaged stone cottage 17     
 years ago.The 11.75 acres in a        
 secluded valley include several large 
 tanks supplied from a brook,and       
 stocked with about 2,000 trout;these, 
 bought with the house,are not a       
 commercially viable enterprise so are 
 fed (at considerable expense) until   
 well-grown,then put into a lake to be 
 caught by fly-fishing.The owners are  
 still "feeling their way" with their  
 land,keeping a goat,2 Shetland ponies,
 3 dogs,geese,chickens &amp; guinea-fowl.  
 Mrs.C.runs a business at the modern   
 Threemilestone Industrial estate near 
 Truro.Mr.&amp; Mrs.C.aim to enjoy the     
 peace and seclusion of Ventontrissick,
 in company with their animals.
