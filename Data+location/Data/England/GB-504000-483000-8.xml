		<title>08SHOPS IN EASTFIELD</title>
		<content> A shopping area and several mobile    
 shops cater for the population's daily
 needs. The purchase of clothing, house
 furniture and furnishings necessitates
 a 5 km  journey into Scarborough town 
 centre, although mail order is a      
 popular means of purchasing such      
 items. There is no garage or petrol   
 filling station so that motorists must
 obtain such services outside          
 Eastfield. The main shopping centre   
 has car parking facilities and a very 
 modern supermarket (selling groceries,
 greengroceries, stationery,           
 newspapers, wines and spirits etc.)   
 which is well supported by nearby     
 shops such as the post office,        
 chemist, fish and chip shop, garden   
 centre, two butchers, a baker's and a 
 general store. Services available are 
 provided by a hairdressing salon, a   
 laundrette and a building society.    </content>
