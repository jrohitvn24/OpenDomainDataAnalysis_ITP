 We visited six farms which cover most 
 of the land marked, one of these, Hook
 End Farm, is known to have been       
 mentioned in the{Domesday Book.}The   
 sizes of the farms varied from 30     
 to 360 acres. Five of them had farm   
 houses dating back to the 16th or 17th
 century. Most had removed{ancient     
{hedges}to enlarge their fields. Hook  
 End alone is non-arable; they produce 
 cattle for meat. Soaphouse Farm, the  
 largest, did have a large herd of     
 Fresians, but because of{EEC policy}it
 changed to arable in 1985. They keep a
 few cattle for breeding but are not   
 allowed to sell milk as they have no  
 licence.
