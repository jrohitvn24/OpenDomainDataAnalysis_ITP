		<title>04Blackmoorfoot's Water</title>
		<content> The present works are unable to treat 
 water to modern standards and one new 
 works at{Blackmoorfoot}will replace   
 the existing three.                   
                                       
 When the rain falls it is usally      
 clean but by the time it gets to the  
 reservoir it has got clay,mud,twigs,  
 leaves and grass as well as germs in  
 it,so it has to go to the{Treatment   
{Plant.}                               
                                       
 First chemicals are added to make the 
 lumps of dirt stick together.Then tiny
 bubbles of air are blown in to make   
 the dirt float to the top.The water   
 flows down sand pipes.Dirt sticks to  
 the sand,after that chlorine is added 
 to kill the germs.{The water is then  
{pumped into a service reservoir       
{waiting  for the consumer to turn on  
{her tap.                              </content>
