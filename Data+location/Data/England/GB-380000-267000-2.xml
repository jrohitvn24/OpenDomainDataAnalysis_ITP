 I have enjoyed finding out about my   
 area.I was born in Stourport and have 
 always lived here but have found out  
 more about local industries and       
 farming since starting this project.  
 It has been great working within a    
 class and also small groups exploring 
 the countryside.We found a vineyard at
 Astley Burf which I didn't know       
 existed,it was great getting out of   
 the classroom!I feel proud to have    
 been a part of something that will    
 produce a record that will last and   
 give people in the future a look at   
 how we lived in the Stourport area and
 the rest of the country in 1985.The   
 original Domesday book of 1086 has    
 given us information about England at 
 that time and our record will be just 
 as important in the future.           </content>
