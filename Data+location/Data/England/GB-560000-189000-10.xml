     Hill Farm has been a farm since   
 the Middle Ages.  The present owners  
 are Mr. and Mrs. Bloomfield.  The     
 Bloomfield family have worked the farm
 for three generations,and the present 
 size of the farm is 205 acres.  Most  
 of the land is owned by the Bloomfield
 family but part is owned by the Church
 and part by the Council.              
                                       
     Hill Farm has always been a Dairy 
 Farm. At the time of our visit in June
 1985 there were 80 Friesian cows and a
 Polled Hereford bull named Senator.   
 Due to E.E.C. milk quotas Hill Farm is
 now in the process of changing to a   
 completely Arable farm.   The present 
 crops grown are :- Winter Barley and  
 Cultivated Pasture. Permanant Pasture 
 63 acres.
