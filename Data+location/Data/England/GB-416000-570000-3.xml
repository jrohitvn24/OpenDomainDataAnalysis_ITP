		<title>03THE RIVER PONT</title>
		<content> The{River Pont}flows through Ponteland
 for around four miles with the whole  
 stretch of the Pont being around seven
 miles long. The river is partly under 
 private ownership, for instance the   
 stretch which runs behind Runneymede  
 Road.The rest of the river is         
 controlled by the{Northumbrian Water  
{Authority}(N.W.A.). Although the river
 Pont is a very small river compared to
 waters such as the rivers{Tyne}or     
{Wansbeck,}it still contains quite a   
 large variety of fish.These include   
 brown trout,grayling,eels,perch and   
 gudgeon to a smaller extent.          
 Also a few rainbow trout have just    
 been introduced. The recent building  
 of the sewage works at{Fox Covert Lane
 has killed a large number of fish but 
 on the whole the Pont is mainly a good
 trout stream.
