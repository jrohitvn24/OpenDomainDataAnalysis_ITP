		<content> "A nice quiet friendly place" is how  
 one resident summed up the village in 
 reply to questions posed by the Parish
 Council. The majority of people are   
 very happy with things as they are,   
 though suggestions were made that     
 lighting and van deliveries could be  
 improved: A Saturday club for the     
 young pople provided, with a disco,   
 snooker, indoor soft-ball tennis and a
 Space Invaders video game. About Civil
 Defence only a minority offered       
 opinions, but of those twice as many  
 were against making emergency plans   
 for a war-situation as those for, on  
 the grounds of inducing a false       
 feeling of security, naivety; and the 
 risk of undermining international     
 trust.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
