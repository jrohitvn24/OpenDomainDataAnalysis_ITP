		<content>    {RURAL EAST LEICESTERSHIRE         
   Owston is set in the rolling east   
 Leicestshire countryside on a north   
 slope on mostly clay soil. With the   
 exception of Owston Woods, the area is
 farmed with a traditional field       
 structure containing grass and arable 
 crops. The older grass fields show    
 ridge and furrow formation and west   
 and south of the village earthworks   
 are evident. Although hedge_cutting   
 machinery is used, the skilful craft  
 of hedge laying is retained. There has
 been extensive tree planting and      
 ageing hedgerow trees are being       
 replaced. There are numerous public   
 footpaths and minor roads which are   
 kept in reasonably good repair and    
 there are many springs and small      
 streams and a ford at Newbold. The    
 church is on the edge of the village -
 most farms have modern barns.         </content>
