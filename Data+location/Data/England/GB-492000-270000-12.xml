		<title>12Irthlingborough's New Bridge</title>
		<content>     The new bridge was built because  
the old bridge could not carry the     
weight of modern day traffic. It was   
built in 1936. At that time there was  
a railway line beside the river with a 
gated level crossing on the road,so,   
the new bridge was designed to overcome
both of these problems at the same     
time. By comparison to the old bridge, 
the new one is very long,nearly a      
quarter of a mile. It is actually 420  
metres long and 10 metres high. It is  
a viaduct design with 50 arches and it 
is made of re-inforced concrete. It can
be described as "functional" rather    
than "beautiful". At the same time, a  
much needed by-pass for Irthlingborough
was also built. It was all opened on   
October 23rd 1936 by Mr.Leslie         
Hore-Belisha,who at that time was the  
Minister of Transport.
