		<title>17SPALDWICK CHURCH</title>
		<content> Spaldwick has a very old church with a
 spire.Half way down the spire are     
 three gargoyles.There used to be four 
 but one was knocked off.Gargoyles are 
 heads with a hole in the mouth.When it
 rains the water pours out of the hole.
 Gargoyles are ugly.They are supposed  
 to scare away the eval demon.On top of
 the spire there is a weather vane.The 
 weather vane is a cock.There are      
 eleven carved-heads.The heads are     
 dotted all round the church.The walls 
 of the church are so thick and heavy  
 that seventeen buttresses are         
 needed.Buttresses help to strengthen  
 the wall. The church is surrounded by 
 a grave yard.There are three sundials 
 facing south at spaldwick.
