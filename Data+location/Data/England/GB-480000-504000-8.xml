		<content>       **{Egton Village Shop}**        
                                       
 The village shop is on the main road  
 in the village. They sell cigarettes, 
 pies, sausage rolls, groceries,       
 newspapers, magazines and             
 wines/spirits.                        
                                       
 Tuesdays &amp; Thursdays are the best     
 selling days because the{Bothams}bread
 is delivered. The shop is open 6 days 
 a week, from 9 to 5.30.               
                                       
 There is a new shopkeeper who hopes   
 they will build up trade as the weeks 
 go by ... the shop has potential for  
 supplying the needs of{Egton.         
                                       
 The shop keeper lives in Fryup Dale,  
 so if we have a bad Winter the        
 assistant will have to come by train.
