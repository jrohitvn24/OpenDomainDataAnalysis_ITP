		<title>01Newark and its western side</title>
		<content> The arrow straight Roman{Fosseway}    
 takes us past the bends of the        
 navigable R.Trent and aims straight   
 for Newark Church.  The cooling towers
 of the power station dominate the flat
 agricultural landscape and act as     
 targets for RAF bombing practices.    
 Nearer Newark the houses sprawl along 
 the Fosse until large housing estates 
 are seen near the R.Devon.  On        
 entering Newark we pass historic      
 commercial, domestic and industrial   
 buidings, especially near the         
 now quiescent dockland on the Trent.  
 Hidden in the centre of Newark lies a 
 French style market place, the bustle 
 of activity serenely watched over by  
 the imposing Church tower.  Here we   
 are at the crossroads of yet another  
 historic route, the Great North       
 Road.
