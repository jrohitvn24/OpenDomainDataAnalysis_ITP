		<content> The most established industries in the
 area are to be found in Mill Lane     
 where large boat yards are found.Frank
 Hall and Son have been boat builders  
 and outfitters for 91 years and claim 
 to be the oldest family business in   
 the area.Bedwell and Co. yacht        
 outfitters have been in business for  
 40 years but one of their buildings   
 once housed the old horse drawn hearse
 of the local undertaker.Several small 
 manufacturing industries are to be    
 found at the top of Hall Lane but the 
 iron foundry, famous for casting Big  
 Ben,is now closed
