		<title>01Farmland East of Bodmin Moor</title>
		<content> This area around Lewannick village is 
 predominantly dairy farmland. Farms   
 average sixty to a hundred acres      
 usually employing family labour or one
 or two local people. Crops are        
 grassland for grazing, hay and silage 
 with some barley for winter feeding.  
 The land is open and hilly, a few     
 wooded areas, steeper slopes on which 
 beef cattle graze. Sheep also graze   
 the rougher land. Stone walls and     
 hedges enclose the fields giving      
 protection from rough weather from    
 Bodmin Moor. The old stone cottages   
 and farmhouses, many recently         
 renovated on a government grant, are  
 interspersed with modern bungalows. A 
 considerable number of cottages and   
 bungalows are occupied by non-local   
 retired people. The Anglican church,  
 Methodist chapel, inn and village     
 hall provide meeting places.          </content>
