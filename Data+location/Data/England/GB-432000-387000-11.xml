		<content> The shops are clustered around the    
 junction of Holme Lane, Bradfield     
 Road, Langsett Road and Middlewood    
 Road. They consist of a variety of    
 smaller shops with three supermarkets.
 Most of the local people shop here for
 their weekly goods and use the city   
 centre shops for any special          
 purchases. The area is well served by 
 buses which enable people from outside
 the area to use the shopping          
 facilities. The rows of shops stretch 
 for a considerable distance along     
 Holme Lane, Middlewood Road and       
 Langsett Road, in fact, stretching on 
 Infirmary Road almost to West Bar. The
 area has many corner shops, and       
 Upperthorpe has its own small shopping
 centre consisting of about twenty     
 shops.
