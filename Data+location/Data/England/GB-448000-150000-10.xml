		<content>{The Gamekeeper}                       
 Mr. Cobb is gamekeeper of 700 acres at
 Ashe Warren. His job is to rear and   
 care for game such as pheasant,       
 partridge and deer. His year begins in
 April when he collects the eggs to    
 hatch them in an incubator. After     
 hatching they stay in cages until they
 are six weeks old, after which they   
 are allowed to go free. There are     
 eight organised shoots a year between 
 October and January. It costs a man   
 approximately 1,000 pounds for a 'gun'
 i.e. the right to go shooting for one 
 day. At the end of the day he will be 
 entitled to a brace of pheasants.     
 Surplus pheasants are sold to licensed
 butchers. The gamekeepper employs 17  
 'beaters' for each shoot and he has   
 four retrieving dogs to pick up the   
 birds.
