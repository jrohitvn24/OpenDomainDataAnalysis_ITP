		<title>08Mrs Hardwick The Chuchwarden</title>
		<content> The church warden has the power to    
 keep order in the church and          
 churchyard and to assist the priest in
 every way. She gets everything ready  
 for services , cleans up, and when the
 chrch is not in use, it has to be     
 locked up.                            
  To get the post of churchwarden Mrs  
 Hardwick had to be elected. She has   
 been woking at the church for         
 twenty-seven years, four of those as  
 churchwarden.                         
  There are not many foreign visitors  
 to the church and only about three    
 funerals, marriages and               
 christenings are                      
 held at the church every year.        
  To help with repairs to the church   
 (such as holes in windows), the Womens
 Institute donate money fron a         
 covenant.                             
                                       </content>
