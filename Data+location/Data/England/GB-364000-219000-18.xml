		<title>18LOCAL HISTORY</title>
		<content> Children are told that History is His 
 Story therefore Local History is that 
 of our forefathers and we need to     
 preserve not only the evidence but    
 also the knowledge of their existence 
 for they were the Celts,Romans,Normans
 and Danes.The Celts were here before, 
 during and after the Roman occupation 
 and their presence is reflected in the
 Place Names in the locality.Wigpool   
 (Weeg Pool) meaning Wooded Hole. Moors
  (mwr+s) meaning Broken down Building 
 .The Welsh language is informative and
 these two references refer to the     
 'Roman Hole'i.e.their source of iron  
 ore supply and a relict of Roman or   
 Norman occupation.The Lea is derived  
 from land cleared by the Romans for   
 crops for the village was on the      
 periphery of the Roman Town of        
 Ariconium or Urarc in Welsh           
 meaning Precious Metal i.e.Iron.      </content>
