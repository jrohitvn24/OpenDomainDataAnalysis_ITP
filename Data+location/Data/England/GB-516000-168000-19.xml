		<title>19CLATTERN BRIDGE, KINGSTON</title>
		<content> The{Clattern Bridge}crosses over the {
{River Hogsmill,}just before it joins  
 the River Thames.  The stone arch on  
 the downstream side are the oldest    
 parts of the bridge.  The original    
 CLattern Bridge was only eight feet   
 wide and the oldest bit is still      
 driven over every day. It was built in
{1293.} It was called the Clattern     
 Bridge because you could hear horses  
 hoofs crossing the Bridge.  On the    
 bridge there is a badge with the three
 fishes of Kingston.  This is the{Coat 
{of Arms}of{Kingston}dated{1623.} The  
 shield shows three silver salmon on a 
 background of blue.  One of the{      
{Domesday Book entries}for Kingston    
 mentions three salmon fisheries in the
 Thames at Kingston. In 1984 some small
 salmon were put back into the river as
 the river is now getting cleaner.
