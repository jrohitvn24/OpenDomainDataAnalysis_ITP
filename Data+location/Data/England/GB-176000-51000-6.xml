		<title>06A Home at Reen Cross</title>
		<content> I live on a old farm house manor at   
 Reen Cross which is a small hamlet    
 situated near to Goonhavern.          
  The manor is about four hundred years
 old and stands on the south facing    
 hillside commanding a panoramic view  
 of the surrounding countryside.The    
 farmhouse is built of traditional     
 Cornish stone and slate and has an    
 adjoining mediaeval barn which is     
 listed as being of historic           
 interest.We keep a herd of Friesian   
 cows on our a hundred and twenty acres
 of land.                              
  Part of the manor has been converted 
 recently into flats to accommodate    
 tourists who stay with us in the      
 summer.Perranporth is nearby its      
 beaches being only fifteen minutes    
 walk away.
