		<content> I live in a semi-detached house which 
 is fairly near a park and a river. The
 house is very old and the only house  
 of its kind which has four bay        
 windows. We were told when we bought  
 the house that it was the show house  
 of the street. We have finally started
 the decorating and we are trying to   
 restore to its natural look, with oak 
 doors and repairing the leaded light  
 windows. The front garden is fairly   
 small with a hedge surounding it and a
 large tree in the middle. We have a   
 large garage with a side entrance     
 which leads to the back door and back 
 garden. The back garden is very big   
 with a greenhouse, two sheds,a double 
 swing with see-saw and a rabbit hutch 
 and run in it. The house has eight    
 rooms altogether with three bedrooms  
 and a play room. The kitchen has been 
 extended and is now a reasonable size.</content>
