 eatablished in 1919. The area         
 covered by glass houses is 2.5 acreas.
 The nursery grows chrysanthemums only.
 25,000 cuttings are planted each week.

 the Canaries and South Africa. After  
 12-18 weeks the mature plants are cut 
 and transported to wholesalers.       
  In{Tower Nursery's}7 greenhouses,    
 cucumbers and tomatoes are grown. This
 produce has been grown since about    
 1957. Cucumbers are the main crop

 then harvested, sorted, graded and    
 sold to Covent Garden or Spitalfields 
 in London. Some go direct to the shop.</content>
