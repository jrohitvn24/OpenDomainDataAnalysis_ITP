		<content> COWS.                                 
 Dairying, and rearing of Suckler      
 cows,is practised on Alston Moor.     
 The popular breed of dairy cow is the 
{Friesian}but there is a good herd of  
{Ayrshires.}The usual herd size is     
 about sixty but sometimes there are as
 many as eighty or more in a herd.     
 Suckler cows usually calve around     
 March or April but the dairy herds are
 normally calving all year round.      
 The most popular bull is the Charolais
 because it gives good meat calves and 
 they fatten quite quickly.The breeds  
 of Suckler cows are crosses of        
 Friesian and{Aberdeen Angus}or        
 Friesian and{Hereford}but there can be
 many crosses with different types of  
 cows or bulls.There are some farmers  
 who use A.I. but most have their own  
 bulls  because it is cheaper in the   
 long run.                             </content>
