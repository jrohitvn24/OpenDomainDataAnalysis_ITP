		<title>06Housing in Kippax</title>
		<content> Most of the houses in Kippax are      
 semi-detatched and then the next      
 largest group are detachrd. Then there
 is terraced and second to last are    
 bungalows. Not many people live in    
 flats. The blocks of flats are off    
 from Kippax Main Street. The flats are
 not high rise, they only have three   
 stories. In Kippax there are more     
 private houses than council houses.   
 Most of the council houses are in an  
 estate called the 'Wimpeys'. There are
 twice as many private than council    
 houses. The reason for this is that   
 people prefer to own their own houses.
 The average age of houses in Kippax is
 25 years. Some of the houses are 70,80
 or 90 years old. The oldest house is  
 Kippax Hall, which is derelict. It is 
 Victorian. The newest houses are on   
 the outskirts of Kippax. There are    
 several new private estates.          </content>
