		<title>11Farm survey</title>
		<content> We asked all the members of our class 
 who have farms to fill in the form.   
 These were the questions;             
 1.How many acres do you farm?         
 2.What type of farming do you use most
   of your farm for?                   
 3.How many cattle,sheep,pigs,goats,   
   chickens,other animals do you have? 
 4.Where do you sell most of your      
   produce?                            
 5.How would you describe the landuse  
   around Coads Green?                 
 6.What is the biggest change in       
   farming in this area over the last  
   few years--if any?                  
 We had 6 replies from farms sized 210,
 205,200,140,70and 14 acres.The answers
 to Q5 all agreed that the predominant 
 landuse around Coads Green is mainly  
 grassland for dairy and beef cut for  
 silage and some cereal grown to feed  
 the farmers own animals.              </content>
