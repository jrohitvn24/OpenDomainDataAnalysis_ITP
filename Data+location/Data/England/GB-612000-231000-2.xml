		<content>    Our{School}is called Mistley       
 Norman{Primary School.}The school     
 got its name from the old school      
 which was built by Edward Norman in   
 1856.                                 
    We have been in the new school     
 since 1981. The new school is shaped  
 like a spaceship. There are 5         
 classrooms called bases joined        
 together. The hall is used for P.E.,  
 assemblies and dinners. The hall is in
 the middle and the 5 classrooms are   
 around the edge. There are three      
 extensions which have roofs made of   
 glass. The playing field is for       
 sports. We have a visual aids room,   
 a staff room and an office. There are 
 148{children,}5 teachers, one         
 secretary,1 cleaner and 10 mums who   
 come to help with our{education}by    
 helping with Reading, Art and Crafts  
 and Sewing.                           </content>
