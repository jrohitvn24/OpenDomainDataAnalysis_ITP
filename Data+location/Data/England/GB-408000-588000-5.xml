   The W.I. meets one evening a month  
 and is a purely socila gathering with 
 a talk and supper.                    
   Being a national institution, one   
 member attends County and National    
 meetings during the year where views  
 of national interest are discussed and
 resolutions put forward to the        
 relevant bodies.                      
   In the past it was one of the few   
 forms of entertainment for County     
 women, with talks that were both      
 informative and entertaining. With the
 advent of television and the facility 
 of private transport this is no longer
 of such importance and it is difficult
 to keep up numbers. The present       
 meetings are attended by about 10     
 members.                              
                                       
                                       </content>
