		<title>05THE SPONSORED SWIM</title>
		<content>   On Wednesday, 29th. May 1985, Brian 
Hunt, John Bruneau, Matthew Eglise,    
David Reid and Richard Webb with       
Mrs Hunt and Mr Rumens, all            
representing Kilndown Primary School,  
took part in a Sponsored Swim for the  
British Heart Foundation. It was held  
at the St. Johns Pool in Tunbridge     
Wells, where the school swims every    
Tuesday of term time. We raised 365    
pounds.                                
   On Friday, 5th. July, Mr Ken        
Boughton and Mr Vernon Rowe of the     
Tunbridge Wells Branch came to school  
and gave out certificates, badges and  
T-shirts. Richard, Brian, Mrs Hunt and 
Mr Rumens got T-shirts.    The         
Tunbridge Wells area has raised 3000   
pounds so far. The School may win a    
shield for the largest amount raised   
by a school in the Tunbridge Wells     
area.                                  </content>
