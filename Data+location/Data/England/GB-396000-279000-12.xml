		<title>12THE PEOPLE OF FRANKLEY</title>
		<content> Most of the people who moved to       
 Frankley were young couples and so the
 area has a very high proportion of    
 both young families and children      
 compared with most areas in the       
 country.Many of these are one parent  
 families struggling to bring up       
 children on their own.Many others have
 either one or both parents unemployed 
 and are receiving state assistance.Of 
 those employed the majority work in   
 the car industry,especially at the    
 local B.M.C.Austin/Rover plant in     
 Longbridge.Others are also in factory 
 or shop work.Because many parents are 
 working,especially those on shift work
 many school children are alone at home
 or baby sit for younger offspring.They
 are expected at an early age to do    
 housework,cooking and shopping.They   
 are relied on heavily to help the     
 family group.                         </content>
