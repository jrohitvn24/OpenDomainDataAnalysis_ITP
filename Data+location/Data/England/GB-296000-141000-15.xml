		<content> Every May there is a Dunster Festival 
 where many villagers dress up in      
 period costume and the village streets
 are decorated with bunting. The       
 Festival was started on an annual     
 basis on the occasion of Queen        
 Elizabeth's II Silver Jubilee. Down   
 the centre of the High Street are a   
 range of stalls selling home-made     
 goods, others with games of chance or 
 demonstrations. These stalls are a    
 reminder of the times when 'The       
 Shambles' stretched the length of the 
 High Street many years ago. The       
 entertainment also includes folk      
 dancing, exhibitions, dances and      
 Village Sports. The festivities take  
 place over two days, a Sunday and a   
 Monday on one of the Bank Holidays.
