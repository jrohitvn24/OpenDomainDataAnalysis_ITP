		<title>08Hartford Works</title>
		<content>   The area near Hartford Works is a   
 lively, bustling place. There is a    
 large industrial estate which includes
 Ferranti, Wastedrive, Dews and        
 Hartford Works itself. Housing estates
 are present, tower blocks and         
 bungalows. The bungalows are ideal for
 elderly people. The housing estates   
 are hunting grounds for first time    
 buyers. Commercial and busy, Ferranti 
 stands prominent across the old       
 railway bridge leading to Manchester  
 Road. Standing behind is Wastedrive.  
 Lorries collecting scrap take it here 
 to be recycled. Opposite Wastedrive is
 Dews which does industrial landscaping
 for large businesses. Pubs, Hotels,   
 Bars and Inns are around every corner.
