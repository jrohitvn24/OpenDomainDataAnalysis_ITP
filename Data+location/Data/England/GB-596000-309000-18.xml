		<title>18A PUPIL'S DAY IN TOFTWOOD</title>
		<content> At 10.30 a.m. science had finished and
 we had break, during which my friends 
 and I walk about the school talking.  
 At 11.00 a.m. we get changed for P.E.,
 it was tennis and we practised our    
 fore-hand shots. At 12.00 I had       
 finished the lesson and my friends and
 I went to the Dining Hall for my      
 lunch, sandwiches, crisps, chocolate  
 biscuits and a drink. At 12.15 p.m. we
 came inside because it was raining, we
 were outside again by 12.45 p.m. and  
 it remained fine till 1.00 p.m. when  
 we have registration. By 1.15 p.m. I  
 was in Maths and stayed there until   
 2.15 p.m., which is when I go to      
 music. We were there till just after  
 2.45 p.m. and by 3.00 p.m. we were in 
 R.E., but our teacher was away so we  
 did homework etc. At 3.30 school      
 finished. I stopped in Dereham before 
 getting home at 4.15 p.m.             </content>
