 There is no commercial entertainment  
 in the area; the nearest cinema is 25 
 miles away.  The village makes its own
 which includes:- St.Keverne Silver    
 Band formed in the 1890s from         
 fishermen, farmers and quarrymen.  It 
 is the most southerly based band in   
 the U.K. with their own exclusive     
 bandroom.  Their instruments are worth
 Â£24,000. It is also the most travelled
 Cornish band competing overseas quite 
 frequently. The Ladies Choir perform  
 for charities, churches and chapels.  
 The Kaudlers (Cornish for 'messing    
 about') started in 1967 perform annual
 pantomimes in the Parish Hall. There  
 is also a thriving Local History      
 Society and a Badminton club. The St. 
 Keverne Male Voice Choir founded in   
 1944 meets every Monday in the Church 
 Hall and performs for charity.        </content>
