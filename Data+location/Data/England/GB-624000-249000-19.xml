		<title>19A day in the life of.......</title>
		<content> In the morning I get up and get       
 dressed and by that time it is 9.45.  
 After that I have breakfast. I have   
 Shreddies and a bit of marmalade on   
 toast. Later I call for Christopher   
 Wells and Carl and Martin come out.   
 Sometimes we go down Haugh Lane and   
 climb trees. We climb trees for two   
 hours and then I have lunch. I have a 
 snack like soup or a hamburger. Then I
 stay in for a while - about an hour.  
 Later I go out but nobody is there so 
 I watch T.V., but nothing good is on  
 so I start a Lego ship, but halfway   
 through I hear somebody outside so I  
 go out and we play football but most  
 of the time it is unfair, then I go in
 for tea. Most of the time I have      
 chips. Then I watch a video like      
 Cannonball Run. Then I go to bed. {
