 No animal has ever{escaped}from       
 the market on to the road but they    
 have escaped on to the car park.      
   Tenbury Market doesn't sell wool    
 because it is illegal,the wool is sold
 at{Bromyard Wool Marketing Board.     
 Tenbury has been altered and is the   
 first market in the{West Midlands}to  
 have a Cattle weighbridge,a built in  
 selling ring and the pens renewed and 
 they have had a new fruit selling ring
 recently.                             
   Mr.Bufton the{auctioneer}likes his  
 job because it is very involved with  
 the public and he likes shouting away 
 like mad.There are ten full time staff
 workers and on market days eight or   
 ten part time workers.Tenbury Market  
 had a fire about fifteen years ago in 
 the fruit selling days.
