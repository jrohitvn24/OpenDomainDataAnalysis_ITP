		<content> All the products i.e.{rail,fish plates
{and sleepers}are set in ranks for     
 examination which if passed allows    
{stamping and grading}before{stockpiles
 are constructed.Loading is normally on
{rail carriages(120 feet long)}or road 
 if length permits.BSC now employs less
 than 1000 men,but only five years     
 previously{primary ironmaking}from raw
 materials to{molten steel production  
 was carried out with{hot ingots}going 
 into{soaking pits.}The ingots were    
{cogged}down as mentioned with the     
 process being similar to the present. 
 since the closing of the ironworks in 
 1981 the area of BSC has dramatically 
 declined.The{ironworks and the        
{Bessamer Sinter plant}have now been   
 scrapped and only large areas of land 
 are left to remind people of what once
 stood there.
