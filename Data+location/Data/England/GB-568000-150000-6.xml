 Typical English villages, Nettlestead 
 and Yalding have a mixed population,  
 some well-off people, some relatively 
 poor people (but none terribly poor)  
 and many in between. Yalding has two  
 private estates, Oast Court and the   
 Downs Farm estate. Both Nettlestead   
 and Yalding contain more Council-owned
 houses than is usual in villages,     
 Nettlestead having Bryants Close and  
 Bishops Close and Yalding's include   
 Medway Avenue and others not in this  
 block. The Nook is a Council          
 development for elderly people with a 
 warden. Several former Council tenants
 are purchasing their houses. A typical
 family home has 3 rooms downstairs and
 3 rooms and a bathroom upstairs.      
 Perhaps untypically, many local houses
 have no garages on site though they   
 may be available.                     </content>
