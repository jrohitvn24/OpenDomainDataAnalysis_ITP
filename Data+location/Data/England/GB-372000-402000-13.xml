		<content> WORSLEY POOL                          
 The new Worsley Pool was opened in    
 1974 and the old baths was made into  
 two small teaching pools.The large    
 pool is 25 metres by 12 metres and is 
 2 metres deep.It costs 32p for an     
 adult, 16p for children and 10p for   
 spectators.Six and a half thousand    
 people use the pool each week and 700 
 of these have lessons.Three hundred   
 and fifty children belong to the      
 swimming club and there is coaching   
 tuition for promising swimmers.There  
 is also a sauna, solarium and an      
 aerotone and a weight training room   
 has just opened.The Worsley Sub Aqua  
 Club meets at the baths once a week.We
 go from school once a week for a      
 swimming lesson.In the entrance hall  
 there is now a pool table, juke box   
 and several video machines.
