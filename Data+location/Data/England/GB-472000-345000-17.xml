		<title>17Trade Flintham/Syerston.</title>
		<content> There is a{lack of facilities}in both 
 villages, neither having a shop. A sub
 post office is housed in a Syerston   
 kitchen bureau. The Elston postmaster 
 brings his post office in a suitcase  
 to Flintham for 2 hours each Thursday,
 setting up in the Old School kitchen. 
 Post is delivered daily &amp; collected   
 twice a day except Sundays.           
 Milk is delivered daily and the milk  
 man brings bread to order. Free range 
 eggs, vegetables and soft fruit in    
 season are available at several homes.
 The East Bridgford butcher delivers to
 Flintham once a week, groceries are   
 delivered to Syerston from Elston. A  
 mobile pork butcher came to Flintham  
 until November 1985 but stopped as it 
 wasn't paying. This has been the      
 pattern over the last few years, with 
 Flintham's shop and various roundsmen 
 not making enough money to keep going.</content>
