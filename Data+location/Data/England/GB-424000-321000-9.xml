		<content>     Burton has three local newspapers.
Two of them, the "Trader" and the      
"Advertiser" are free weekly papers,   
with some articles but mainly          
advertisements.   The "Burton Daily    
Mail", though, is the only daily paper 
and provides lots of useful            
information.   It is a good paper to   
read and catch up with the latest      
gossip.   The front page has big black 
letters which make out the main story. 
The second page has personal           
announcements.   Every Monday there is 
a gardening page.   Every now and again
there is a schools corner, with        
information about local schools.   Each
day there is an "Out of Doors" column, 
a crossword and a horoscope.   At the  
back there are reports on local sports.
The Burton Mail has lots of photographs
in it.
