		<title>07KILSBY OLD PEOPLE'S HOME</title>
		<content>   There are 18 old people in the home 
 and about 25 helpers to look after    
 them.The helpers like looking after   
 the old people but it is hard work.   
 They bath them,feed them,get them     
 ready for bed,change and dress them,  
 take them to the toilet and talk to   
 them.The helpers all wear a uniform.  
   The old people like the home and    
 enjoy their food.They spend their time
 watching television,reading, sewing   
 and they talk to each other about the 
 past.                                 
   They do not have many visitors      
 because their families live so far    
 away but one old lady's daughter      
 visits her every day. The oldest lady 
 is 105 and others are in their        
 nineties. It costs about Â£175 to stay 
 a month.
