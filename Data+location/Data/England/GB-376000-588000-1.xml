		<title>01The Comb,History and Forest</title>
		<content> The Comb, now 2 cottages (one holiday)
 and a separate out-door Centre Hotel, 
 was built in 1800 but the remains of  
 the old bastle can still be seen in   
 the field opposite and behind are the 
 pens for the cattle on the old drove  
 road from Scotland to England. To the 
 south, west and north lies the        
 forests, to the east the remaining    
 farm land extending south down the    
 road though Shipley Sheils, Gleedlee  
 and Gatehouse Bastle remain at Shipley
 and Gatehouse.                        
 In the forest on the west side of the 
 Tarset Burn are are the bastles of    
 Corbit Jack and Barty, both in ruins. 
 The best land is used for hay and     
 other times with rest used for        
 suckling catle and sheep. Roe Deer ae 
 common in the Forest and on occasions 
 graze in the fields. At Waterhead     
 there used to be a ford but it is now </content>
