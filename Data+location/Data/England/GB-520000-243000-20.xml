		<title>20West Sunderland Farm.</title>
		<content>   Mr Smith originally owned this farm 
 but it was then purchased by a Mr     
 Kidman and has since then been passed 
 down from generation to generation.   
   The farm is now run by a Mr Reynolds
 who is the foreman. The farm is 270   
 acres in size and has 3 fields of     
 wheat and one of barley. There were   
 hedges on the farm but these have been
 removed to make way for cultivated    
 land.                                 
   There are 2 barns on the farm, one  
 contains machinery the other a large  
 corn drier. At harvest time extra     
 labour arrives at the farm from one of
 Mr Kidmans other farms near St Neots. 
 During the rest of the year there is  
 no need for many men as the land is   
 given over to crops which require     
 little attention.
