 it stands right next to the Church    
 which had five bells before 1810.It is
 very old and developed with the coming
 of the turnpike. Now it is well known 
 for its food and many people stop for 
 lunch.                                
 The Kings Head - is where people from 
 North Chailey drink. It used to have a
 cattle market opposite and was a busy 
 coaching inn. It is said to be of     
 Elizabethan origin. Every month the   
 landlord holds a raffle and the winner
 donates the profits to the local      
 charity or cause.                     
 The Horns Ledge-used to get beer from 
 the Cooks Bridge Brewery which burnt  
 down in 1920s. Extended in 1983 and   
 every year it has pantomime which is  
 an enormous success. Mr Copping is the
 landlord and he has local customers   
 from all around village.              </content>
