		<title>14TRAFFIC CENSUS 1ST JULY 1985</title>
		<content> A CENSUS WAS TAKEN AT G.R.560257      
 BETWEEN 10 &amp; 11 am AND 2 &amp; 3 pm. THE  
 A267 IS THE ONLY MAIN ROAD IN THIS    
 AREA. GENERALLY, NORTHBOUND TRAFFIC   
 HEADS FOR TUNBRIDGE WELLS: SOUTHBOUND 
 TRAFFIC DIVERGES AROUND HEATHFIELD FOR
 THE SOUTH COAST- HASTINGS, BRIGHTON   
 AND EASTBOURNE. THE RESULTS SHOW A    
 HEAVY PREPONDERENCE OF PRIVATE CARS.  
 SERVICE BUSES ARE ONE PER HOUR IN     
 EITHER DIRECTION UP TO 6.0 pm. BUT ARE
 UNRELIABLE. MOTOR COACHES ARE SCARCE, 
 AND PART OF THE " THROUGH TRAFFIC ".  
 AGRICULTURAL VEHICLES WERE, IN VIEW OF
 THE NATURE OF THE AREA, EXTREMELY     
 RARE. OF THE LORRIES AND VANS MOST    
 APPEARED TO BE "THROUGH" TRAFFIC      
 THOUGH THERE WERE THE EXPECTED LOCAL  
 DELIVERY VEHICLES. THE WEATHER WAS    
 FINE AND A GREAT PROPORTION OF THE    
 PRIVATE VEHICLES WOULD HAVE BEEN      
 MAKING FOR THE COASTAL RESORTS.       </content>
