		<title>02Colliery slagheaps.</title>
		<content> Slagheaps are a feature of coalmining 
 areas like ours.They are large heaps  
 of slag-the waste product of          
 coalmining.                           
                                       
 Rockingham colliery used to employ    
 many local people.It has now closed   
 and all that is left of the landscape 
 is waste and derelict land.Very little
 of this land has been re-claimed and  
 the site resembles a large black hill.
 At the side of the old colliery there 
 is a coke-handling storage depot.Some 
 of this coke comes from as far away as
 France and Wales.                     
                                       
 Tankersley colliery slagheap has been 
 grassed over and is now used for      
 grazing and for hay.In winter,when it 
 has snowed,children 'sledge'down it on
 plastic bags.
