		<title>04SITTINGBOURNE TOWN CENTRE</title>
		<content> As a result of our survey in the town 
 centre we discovered that many people 
 have lived in the area all their      
 lives. A few moved here because of    
 their work. Several frequently visit  
 the town as it offers good shopping   
 facilities. Most people use the larger
 shops. The smaller shops are finding  
 it increasingly hard to compete and   
 several have recently closed down.    
 Many felt that more should be spent on
 leisure suggesting that a new sports  
 centre with a swimming pool should be 
 built. Others regretted the lack of a 
 hospital and a few thought that there 
 should be a greater variety of shops. 
 People interviewed were unhappy with  
 the road system and felt that         
 pedestrianisation of the main street  
 would be widely welcomed.
