 Ministry of Defence owns much land.It 
 is private land.No member of the      
 public is allowed on the land without 
 permission.Workers at the site have   
 passes to enter the site and have     
 signed the official secrets act.      
  The Ministry of Defence have used the
 site for nearly 40 years.The Ministry 
 of Defence needed a site to test      
 vehicles.As specially adapted vehicles
 were being made at Christchurch the

 army vehicles,civilian vehicles are   
 tested.
