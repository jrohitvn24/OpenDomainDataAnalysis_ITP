		<title>15NAMES OF COPSES AND WOODS</title>
		<content> The name of each wood tells you about 
 its history.  The word 'field'        
 indicates areas converted from arable:
 'furzefield' or 'rough' suggests areas
 which were formerly common or scrub.  
 Some names refer to farmer owners or  
 tenants - Buckman, Oliver, Groom,     
 Butler, Braxby, Reed.  Fox Rough is   
 named after a pub.  Poling Furzefields
 was a detached part of Poling parish  
 until 1878.  Parham Fields is         
 presumably connected with the Bysshopp
 family who lived at Parham Park and   
 owned much land in Angmering.         
 Hammerpot Copse and Charbe Copse are  
 named from these hamlets.  Wepham Ball
 is perhaps named from a Boundary Mound
 known as a ball in old English.  These
 mounds were common in areas without   
 natural stone.  Gibbet Place is where 
 the body of Jack Upperton, a          
 highwayman, was hung in chains in 1771</content>
