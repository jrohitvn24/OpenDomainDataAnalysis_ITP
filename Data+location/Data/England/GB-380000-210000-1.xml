		<content>  The whole block is mainly{farmland}  
 which is pasture. There are many      
 farms. Nearly all are self-supporting 
 and families are engaged in work on   
 the farm. Some farms have cows and    
 sheep, others may just have one kind  
 of animal. The farms vary in size.    
 Only a few appear to have labourers'  
 cottages. Some cottages are thatched; 
 some are named after farms or brooks, 
 eg 'Daniel's Brook Cottages'. Houses  
 are being built in the NW corner of   
 the block. In{Harescombe}the newest is
 about 15 years old. There is some     
 public transport. The{M5}runs         
 diagonally through the block as does  
 the{railway.}There are no shops at    
 all. There are 3 churches, including  
 the very ancient {Harescombe Church.}
