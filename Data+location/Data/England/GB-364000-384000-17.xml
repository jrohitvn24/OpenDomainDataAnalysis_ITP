		<title>17THELWALL VIADUCT</title>
		<content> The Thelwall Viaduct carves its way   
 through the areas, bringing noise and 
 mayhem to the quiet countryside as the
 communters, businessmen and lorries   
 hurtle up and down one of the busiest 
 stretches of motorway in the country  
 to the industrial regions of the North
 and the Midlands.  The weekend        
 caravaners and summer holidaymakers   
 wind their way North to the Lake      
 District or Blackpool or South to     
 Devon and Cornwall.                   
 The Viaduct was opened in l963 and    
 arches upwards over the River Mersey  
 for 2 miles.                          
 The rush hour traffic blocks the three
 lanes and more often than not there   
 are miles of tailbacks.  The Viaduct  
 seems to sprout "cones" regularly     
 closing at least one lane or two.     
 Accidents frequently occur as in the  
 winter fog is common.                 </content>
