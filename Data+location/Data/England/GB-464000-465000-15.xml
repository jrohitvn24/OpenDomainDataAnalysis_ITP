 Methodist,who work closely together   
 and share some services throughout the

 evening each Sunday at both churches, 
 also Sunday schools during the morning
 services.The 11+ children have a      
 separate Sunday group and there is a  
 church creche.There are numerous      
 church groups,some ecumenical and     
 others not,meeting weekly or          
 fortnightly.On Friday evenings during 
 term time the Christian Youth Group   
 meets in the old chapel schoolroom.   
 Activities are organised,also trips to
