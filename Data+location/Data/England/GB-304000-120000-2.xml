            ASHBRITTLE                 
       Ashbrittle is the only village  
 in our block. There was a time when   
 the village was larger. There used to 
 be a grocery shop, a post office, a   
 baker and a pub called the Antelope   
 Inn. There was also a blacksmith and  
 there were petrol pumps at the top  of
 the village.These have all gone now.  
       The village is situated on a    
 hill and can only be approached by    
 narrow twisting lanes.                
       A few people commute to work    
 from Ashbrittle;  for example, the    
 Headmaster of Milverton Primary School
 who lives in the village and Mr David 
 who works in Taunton. Most people who 
 live in Ashbrittle are involved in    
 local farming.                        
       Ashbrittle is a small group of  
 houses with a church and village hall.</content>
