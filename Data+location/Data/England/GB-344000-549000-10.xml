		<title>10COCKLAKES FACTORY,COTEHILL</title>
		<content> My dad used to work at Cocklakes.He   
 operated a pulverizer to get the rock 
 out.Then he made plaster and plaster  
 board .They got the gypsum from       
 Cocklakes mine. Then they got it      
 from Cotehill quarry. Later rock was  
 brought from Kirby Thore .The factory 
 was built in 1930 and it started      
 production soon after.My dad helped to
 make the big shed there.It was dusty  
 and noisy and there were 300 people   
 working there. The mine shut down then
 there were only 120-150 people        
 there.The factory shut down in        
 1980.Now its used for the pipeline.   
 Then it will be abandoned.
