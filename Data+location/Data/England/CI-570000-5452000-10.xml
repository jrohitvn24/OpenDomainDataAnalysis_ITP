		<title>10ST. MARTIN'S IN 1985 (2)</title>
		<content>    The farms are still there, the     
 parish being an agricultural strong-  
 hold: a bastion against the ever-     
 increasing threat of attack by the    
 seemingly insatiable appetite of a    
 growing population for land on which  
 to live.{(Jersey has a population of  
{almost 80,000 on only 45 square miles 
{of land).}                            
    St. Martin's parish has a          
 geographical position that favours the
 early cropping of potatoes, Jersey's  
 principal export, and thus in the     
 island's battle between agriculture   
 and land developers the farmers       
 here still have priority.             
    The leafy lanes are still there,   
 but the number of vehicles using them 
 has greatly increased. Care has to be 
 taken as these narrow lanes were not  
 created with modern-day traffic in    
 mind.                                 </content>
