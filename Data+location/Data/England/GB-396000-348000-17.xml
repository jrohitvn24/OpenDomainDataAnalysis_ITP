		<content>Wetley Rocks is a village in           
Staffordshire where there are a large  
number of small dairy farms.The farms  
grow grass for the cattle to feed on.  
All the farms need to have are sheds or
barns to put the cows into in winter,  
and also for milking them in. The milk 
itself is very important because it    
helps to produce cheese,cream, yoghurt 
and butter.                            
                                       
Old Hall Farm,Consall.                 
This is the original Consall Hall and  
is 300 years old.It has 72 acres and is
a dairy farm.Working hours are from    
6.30am to 7.30pm.The two people who run
the farm have lived there for 24 yrs.  
They have Fresian and Hereford cows.   
The cows are stalled from October to   
May in a computerized barn. They wear  
microchips and their share of food is  
dispensed to them automatically.       </content>
