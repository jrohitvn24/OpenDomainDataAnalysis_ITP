 There are five sections to the        
 football club.These comprise Under    
 11s.to Under 15s.Although the name is 
 "Swinderby Football Club",players are 
 drawn from outside the actual village.
 There are a small number of players   
 however who do reside in Swinderby.The
 teams are organised by a residant of  
 the village.The teams play in the     
 "Kesteven League".Games are played    
 both home and away,the home games     
 being played on the football field in 
 Station Road.The teams in the mid     
 eighties are quite strong having      
 reached the semi _ finals on a number 
 of occasions.The Under 12s.in 1985 won
 many of their games reflecting their  
 strength.
