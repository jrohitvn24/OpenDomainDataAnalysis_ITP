		<content>{Blakedown Railway}station is on the   
{Hereford to Birmingham}line. It       
 has an old signal box and a level     
 crossing. In 1982 the manually        
 operated crossing was replaced by     
 an automatic system.                  
 You go through a white gate onto the  
 platform and wait in a steel waiting  
 room with bench seats. Trains run from
 7.08 am approximately every hour until
 23.42 pm. Trains are more frequent at 
 commuter times taking workers into    
 Birmingham (journey time = 41 minutes)
 in the mornings and returning in the  
 evenings. There is a small car park   
 for the use of commuters.             
 A sign by the railway informs you that
 the penalty for trespassing on the    
 railway is Â£2 or 3 months in prison.
