		<title>10Ecology around Ripe.</title>
		<content>      The soil round Ripe is clay but  
 there is a ridge of sandstone running 
 West to East through Ripe. The area is
 made up of about 20 farms and some 100
 houses. Each farm is divided into     
 fields with hedges or fences. The     
 hedges have grown up since Roman times
 and are a natural cover for wildlife. 
 Hedges are mainly composed of         
 Blackthorn, Whitethorn, Hornbeam,     
 Maple, Privet, Ash, Oak and Hazel.    
 Many other bushes are found such as   
 Beech, Willow, Spindle, Dogwood,      
 Wayfaring tree, Elder, Box, Bullace   
 and Holly.                            
      Nearly all the Elm Trees have    
 been attacked by Dutch Elm Disease.   
 The Council has tried to stop it by   
 chopping down afflicted trees but the 
 stumps sprout so new saplings grow.   
      There are some copses in the area
 but no woods.                         </content>
