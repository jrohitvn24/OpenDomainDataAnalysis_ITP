		<content>My sister sat on a chair watching      
television. My Mum announced that tea  
was ready and slowly we walked into the
kitchen. We ate our food. I went       
outside and put all the stickers I had 
on to the numberplate of my B.M.X.     
bike. I put on the lever grips. I      
decided again to go up to Andrew's. All
the lads were near the shops. We all   
formed a circle and did tricks. I did a
super long track walk, which is putting
one foot on the pedal whilst holding   
the brake and with the other foot you  
pull the wheel along. All my friends   
shouted "Radical!"                     
It was getting late so I returned home 
to Mum, a mug of hot chocolate and bed.
