		<title>07What do our Mums do?</title>
		<content>We found that one third of our Mums    
stayed at home. The most popular paid  
job was cleaning, either offices ,     
schools or private houses. The next    
most popular was working in local      
factories, usually around the Ashbourne
area. Some Mums were outworkers for    
those factories, paid for doing work at
home. There was a great variety after  
that-nurses, shop workers, caterers and
quite a few who helped their husbands  
with book keeping if they were self    
employed. Most mothers said they would 
like to work. They said that they      
either did'nt have the qualifications  
to get good jobs or lacked transport to
get to the areas where the jobs        
existed.
