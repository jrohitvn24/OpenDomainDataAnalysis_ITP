		<content>   The school has changed a lot since  
 then.  It was partly re-built in 1888 
 and almost entirely re-built in 1911. 
   The present headmaster is Mr. P. A. 
 Caine.  There are six classes         
 altogether: 1 nursery class, 2 infant 
 and 3 Junior classes.  We have a hall 
 for assembly and P.E., a library and  
 television room and a dining room.    
 Our class, called "Top Class", is the 
 newest part of the school.  It was    
 built in 1934.  We have also a small  
 playground and 1984 was the first year
 that we used our new playing field.
