		<content>      The hamlet of{Millthrop}was      
 originally built to house the workers 
 at the nearby mill.  The mill         
 buildings have now been converted into
 dwellings.  There are thirty-four     
 habitable houses in Millthrop of which
 four are holiday cottages.  Four      
 dwellings are derelict.  Most of the  
 cottages are very small and many have 
 been recently modernised.  There are  
 no shops but three businesses have    
 their premises in the hamlet - a      
 builder, a small nursery garden and a 
 scrap-metal dealer.  The chapel,      
 telephone box and post box are the    
 only amenities.                       
     {Pinfold}is a camping site which  
 contains 56 static caravans. By law   
 these must only be occupied for eight 
 months of the year.  At the time of   
 this survey there were 28 touring     
 caravans and 26 tents on the site.    </content>
