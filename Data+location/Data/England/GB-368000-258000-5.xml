		<title>05FARMING AT TEDSTONE DELAMERE</title>
		<content> The fertile red sandstone soil of the 
 Teme Valley allows almost any crop to 
 be grown successfully. Farms average  
 200 acres mainly family owned and     
 worked or worked by the farmer tenant 
 with very little paid help. Most      
 fields are intensively managed        
 grassland or cultivated with          
 non-grass crops. Animals are mainly   
 sheep with store cattle but few       
 milking herds. There are several      
 medium sized cattle markets 15-20     
 miles from the area. Milking parlours 
 work on the herringbone system and    
 some farmers link their milking cows  
 to computerised records to check      
 fertility and yields. Most farms have 
 some arable, small cereal fields or   
 potato crops. Potato acreages are     
 governed by a marketing board. There  
 is a small experimental deer farm     
 producing venison.                    </content>
