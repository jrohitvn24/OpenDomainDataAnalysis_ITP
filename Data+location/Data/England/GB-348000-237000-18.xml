		<title>18Holidays For Herefordians.</title>
		<content>  Everybody at some time likes to go on
 holiday either in{England}or abroad.  
   Of the 30 children in our class, 12 
 had at least 2 holidays a year, one   
 even going as far as{Zambia.}Eleven   
 children went overseas, the most      
 popular destination being{Spain,}while
 others went to{France, Greece, Cyprus,
{Portugal}and{Ireland.                 
   It was surprising that only 7 people
 stayed in{hotels;}most families       
 preferred{self-catering}holidays. Four
 took{caravans}and ten rented{cottages 
 or{flats.                             
   The most popular region for holidays
 in{Great Britain}was the South-West.  
 The rest of the class stayed with     
 relatives or enjoyed themselves at    
{home.}Of course we are lucky that we  
 live in such a very beautiful city,   
 itself a holiday resort.
