 Mapperley School is the smallest      
 school we had ever seen.This school   
 has only 32 children in it and had    
 only 2 classrooms, a cloakroom,hallway
 and a small staffroom.The             
 headteacher's name is Mr Treseder,and 
 there is only one more teacher.This   
 teacher only works there on Tuesdays  
 and Fridays,and on the other days Mr  
 Treseder takes all 32 children.There  
 is one big playground that goes all   
 the way round the back.The classrooms 
 are full of pictures.                 </content>
