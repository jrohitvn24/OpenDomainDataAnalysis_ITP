		<title>06ROADS AND TRAFFIC</title>
		<content>    One{main road,}the A22, runs North 
 South through the village of South    
 Godstone. Other roads in the area are{
 mainly{country lanes}bordered by      
 crop fields and pasture land. The     
 country lanes are not particularly    
 well kept and the banks and hedges get
 very overgrown.                       
   {Traffic}is heavy on the main road  
 with as many as 604 cars and lorries  
 travelling towards London during the  
 morning rush hour. During the summer  
 and at fine weekends holiday traffic  
 travels south towards the coast.      
    In the village there are no parking
 facilities for those occupying Evelyn 
 Cottages which means cars are parked  
 along the main road itself. Lorries   
 are parked constantly outside the     
 shops making it hazardous for vehicles
 to join the main road from Hunters    
 Chase.                                </content>
