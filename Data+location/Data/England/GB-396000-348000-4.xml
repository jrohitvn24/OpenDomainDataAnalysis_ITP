		<title>04Transport in Consall area</title>
		<content> ew people do not have some sort of    
transport even if it is just a bike.   
This is because people have the need   
to move from one place to another for  
reasons like shopping,leisure,visiting 
people and work.Some cars or any       
vehicles are so "high tec" that        
they cost enormous amounts of money to 
buy.A normal family car can vary in    
price depending on the size and shape. 
     Many families now have more than  
one car which is vital in such a rural 
area as the bus service is very        
limited.Some areas have no services at 
all so the people must rely entirely on
their own transport.                   
     The bus is a declining form of    
transport with the rise of the motor   
car,other forms of transport in the    
area have also declined,the railway    
along the Churnet Valley is no longer  
used for passengers and has limited use</content>
