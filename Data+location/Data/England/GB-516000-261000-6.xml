		<content>  The second public house, the Royal   
 Oak, is in the middle of the village  
 on the Main Street.Both pubs seem to  
 be popular with the locals and also   
 visitors from traffic on the A45 that 
 now bypasses the village.             
  Most of the people commute to either 
 St.Neots, Bedford, Cambridge or London
 .Only small items of shopping are sold
 in the village shop and post-office.  
 The bus service is not very good but  
 most people have cars or friends give 
 them lifts to St.Neots for shopping.  
  There is now only a playschool in the
 village.This is run by parents and    
 held in the hall that was once the    
 village school.                       
 The older children now have to be     
 bussed to school.This makes it a long 
 day when you are only five years old.
