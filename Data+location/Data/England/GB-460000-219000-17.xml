		<content>  I was walking up the yard &amp; my mum   
had just arrived from work so I went to
say Hello. After that I had a game of  
football with my brother Gary. After   
we'd scored 5 goals each I went down to
see Flash, my calf, &amp; I put his halter 
on him &amp; took him for a walk because it
was very sunny. After I had taken Flash
for his walk my mum was calling me to  
come in for tea, we had fish &amp; chips.  
I was asking my dad if I could keep    
some of the piglets. The time now was  
8.30pm. I went out again &amp; walked down 
the yard. On the way I went to see my  
sister's pony called Fudge, then I     
helped my dad load up the tractor.     
After that I went down to see 53       
again. It was 9.30pm so I ran up the   
yard, went inside &amp; went to bed after  
a very exciting day. (C.RICHARDSON).
