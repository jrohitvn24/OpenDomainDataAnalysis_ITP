		<content>  Mohir Khan:- Our area of London is   
multi-religious. Catholics, Church of  
England Christians, Jews, Muslims and  
Hindus live side by side.              
  Judaism returned to London in the    
mid-17th Century through the           
intercession of Oliver Cromwell. Also  
in the 17th Century the Huguenots,     
French Protestants exiled under the    
Edict of Nantes, came to London. They  
were particularly good Merchants and   
skilled weavers. They settled in East  
London and Spitalfields.               
  In the 1960's other religions came to
the area including Islam, Hindu,       
Buddhist and Tau.                      
  There are 76 churches, the oldest    
being St. Dunstan's, dating from the   
15th Century; 12 Synagogues, including 
Bevis Marks built in 1701 &amp; 5 mosques. 
The East London, costing 3m pounds is  
resplendant with minarets and a dome.  </content>
