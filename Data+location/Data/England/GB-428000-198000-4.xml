		<title>04  The Pub at Radcot</title>
		<content> The Swan Inn, by the River Thames and 
Radcot bridges, is the only place in   
the area for the locals to enjoy a     
drink, or play a game of darts,        
dominoes or shove halfpenny.The        
regular customers are not only from    
Radcot but also from the surrounding   
villages and the town of Faringdon.    
 It is very  popular in the summer     
months with holidaymakers who are      
boating or fishing or caravanning in   
the area. It is also popular with the  
tourist because food is available at   
the pub.There is an attractive         
riverside garden, so that families     
can enjoy themselves watching the      
river traffic whilst eating and        
drinking.                              
 In the grounds is the old stone shed  
originally built for the operator of   
the toll gates on Pidnell Bridge.
