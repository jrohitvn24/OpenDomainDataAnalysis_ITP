		<title>08Mayfield's Population.</title>
		<content> The population of Mayfield in 1985 is 
 3,500.There are many elderly people   
 most of whom have come to  the village
 on retirement.Naturally there are also
 a number who have lived here all their
 lives.Another major group in Mayfield 
 is the farming community but the      
 commuters form the most important     
 group.Many families have come to      
 Mayfield because it is conveniently   
 placed for the man of the house to    
 travel to London,Eastbourne or        
 Tunbridge Wells to work.This means    
 that there are a lot of children in   
 Mayfield.There are not very many      
 employment opportunities in Mayfield  
 and public transport is poor and      
 housing expensive.All these factors   
 mean that young people are forced to  
 leave the village when they start     
 working.This in turn means that the   
 population is always changing.        </content>
