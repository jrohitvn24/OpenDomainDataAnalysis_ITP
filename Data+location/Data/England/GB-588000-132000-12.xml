		<content> Then it's what we've all been waiting 
 for, THE BELL. Out to play! And it's  
 running round the playground crashing 
 into people, rushing round screaming  
 and laughing. Hopefully there's a good
 fight to watch. Then it's the whistle 
 and back inside the prison.Groan.More 
 work, in fact it's work, work, work!  
 Great, it's lunch-time, pity about the
 school dinners though. After lunch we 
 run about on the field, but before    
 you've had time to get started on a   
 really good game it's back inside and 
 more work,work,work. By this time I'm 
 really tired and it's a relief when   
 the final bell goes at last!          
 When I get home my dog jumps up on me 
 and licks my face at least he's happy!
 Then it's time for a cup of tea and   
 sit down to watch T.V. I have my      
 supper and (yawn) go to bed.          
 Goodnight!                            </content>
