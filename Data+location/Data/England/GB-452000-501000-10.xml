		<title>10SERVICES TO THE HOME</title>
		<content> As we live in a sparsely populated    
 area of farm, forest &amp; moorland,      
 services are scant. There are very few
 metalled roads &amp; no bus services. We  
 have no shops &amp; so a car is needed.   
 The milkman calls 3 days a week. There
 is one post box &amp; a Landrover is used 
 by the postman in winter. Deliveries  
 are to locked mailboxes at the        
 roadside if the track is long. There  
 are no travelling shops, but the      
 mobile library calls fortnightly. The 
 overhead electricity lines are checked
 annually by a man walking the line in 
 good weather. Cooking, heating &amp;      
 lighting are fuelled by electricity,  
 oil or solid fuel. There is no gas    
 supply. All the farms use spring      
 water, although piped water is also   
 available. There is no mains sewerage.
 The dustmen come to the end of the    
 farm tracks and bins are left there.  </content>
