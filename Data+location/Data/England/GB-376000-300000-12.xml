		<title>12Going Shopping</title>
		<content> I go shopping to Telford sometimes.But
 normally I go to Madeley.Madeley has  
 got lots of shops but it hasn't got a 
 roof.I like to go shopping everywhere.
 Madeley has got a library and food    
 shops and a post_office and lots of   
 other things.I like Madeley best but  
 only when it is market day.It smells  
 of dogs and it is very nasty.         
                                       
 I go shopping at Telford Town Centre. 
 There are lots of shops there.There   
 are clothes shops and toy shops.There 
 are Banks to put your money in.You get
 meat from the butchers and cameras    
 from Debenhams and there are three car
 parks,one at the front,one at the     
 side and one at the back.I don't like 
 shopping because it is boring.You hear
 babies cry and trolleys rattling and  
 people talking.
