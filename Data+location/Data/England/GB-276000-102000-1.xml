		<content> Copplestone is a fairly small village 
 in the country, at the junction of the
 A377 and the A3072 to Okehampton.There
 have recently been some council houses
 built. There is 1 shop which is a     
 cross between a Post Office and       
 general stores, Rosemary's hair       
 stylist,and a pub called The Cross    
 Hotel. There is a flourishing Chapel  
 but no church. There are 2 garages, a 
 village hall which is used by the     
 playgroup, and a playing field. Daveys
 Mill and Stoneman's agricultural      
 suppliers are the main businesses in  
 the village together with an an       
 abattoir. There is a station on the   
 line from Exeter to Barnstaple which  
 is unmanned; trains stop by request.  
 At the other end of Copplestone is the
 old Shirley Corner school. It was     
 closed in 1975, and replaced by the   
 new building we are in now.           </content>
