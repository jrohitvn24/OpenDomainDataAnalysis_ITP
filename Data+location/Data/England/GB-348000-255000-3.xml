		<content> Some{jobs}still have to be done by    
{hand,}particularly{tying and        } 
{stringing.}Though autumn planting is  
 machine operated with an apple tree   
 planter from Bulmers, because after   
 the harvest there are no strings to   
 obstruct the machine.                 
{  Hops grow to 16-18 ft, 1,600 plants 
{to the acre,}and the total number of  
 rows at Brierley stretches{227        
{miles.}The plants are prone to fungal 
 diseases and have to be sprayed       
 regularly. There are many types of    
 hops and research continues to find   
 strains that are disease resistant.   
 The types grown at Brierley are{Omega,
{Challenger, Zenith, Northdown}and     
{Northern Brewer.                      
   In 1984 242 tonnes of hops were     
 harvested, selling at Â£4,400 per      
 tonne. All the hops went for beer, the
 only customer being Allied Breweries. </content>
