		<title>08Rainhill's railway station.</title>
		<content> Rainhill was the site  of locomotive  
 trials held in 1829 to test the       
 possibility of using steam locomotion 
 on the newly built railway between    
 Liverpool and Manchester.Todays       
 station no longer carries inter-city  
 traffic, just local traffic. It has   
 two platforms linked by an iron       
 footbridge.                           
 The ticket office has been modernised 
 but the station shares many of the    
 characteristics of small stations     
 elsewhere-apart from morning and      
 evening 'rush hours' there is no      
 permanent staff and passengers have a 
 waiting room with few facilities apart
 from shelter. British Rail have an    
 increasing policy to oblige passengers
 to buy tickets on the train rather    
 than at a station office. One platform
 carries a notice describing the       
 success of Stevenson in 1829.         </content>
