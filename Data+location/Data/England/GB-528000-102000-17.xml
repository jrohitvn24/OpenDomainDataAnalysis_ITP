		<content> The Repeal of the Red Flag Act in 1894
 by Parliament meant that for the first
 time in British history the motor car 
 was able to legally travel above 5mph.
 To celebrate the Royal Automobile Club
 organised arace from Hyde Park Corner,
 London to Madeira Drive in Brighton- a
 distance of over 52 miles.This run has
 now become an annual event 'The       
 Veteran and Vintage Car Ralley',which 
 takes place on the second Sunday in   
 November.                             
  In l977 over 500 competitors took to 
 the same route on bicycles            
 participating in a fund raising event 
 for the British Heart Foundation. With
 an increased popularity of cycling, a 
 fitness 'revolution' and the success  
 of the first event, total numbers of  
 competitors had risen to over 30,000  
 in l984. That was with numbers of     
 applications limited for safety!      </content>
