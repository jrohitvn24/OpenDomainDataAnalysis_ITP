		<content>Some work places use minibuses to ferry
employees to and from their villages.  
CARS   Most families own a car, some   
more than one. Where both parents are  
working in different places two cars   
are needed as public transport is      
inadequate.                            
OTHER PRIVATE TRANSPORT  Motor cycles, 
mopeds, motor scooters, and pedal      
cycles are also used by people to get  
to work or for pleasure. Most children 
have bicycles.                         
AIR TRAVEL   The nearest airport is at 
Norwich (25 miles) with flights to     
other British airports and Amsterdam.
