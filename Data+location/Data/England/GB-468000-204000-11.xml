		<content>Police   P.C. Barry comes into the     
police station at 8 a.m. and signs on. 
Then he looks into his box which tells 
him what to do in the day. Today P.C.  
Barry is going to see a dog that bites 
people and a tyre that is defective.   
That takes him until midday when he has
his lunch, only 45 minutes break. Then 
he visits schools, old people's homes  
etc. At about 3.30 he reports back to  
the station for the last half an hour  
of his shift. At 4.00 p.m. another P.C.
takes over until midnight. That is a   
day in the life of P.C. Barry.
