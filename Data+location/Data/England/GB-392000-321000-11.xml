		<title>11ARCHAEOLOGY IN STAFFORD 1985</title>
		<content>The centre of Stafford is to be        
redeveloped and this gave an           
opportunity for an archaeological dig  
on four main sites in Stafford.     The
Â£digs' were completed last year and    
last month we visited an exhibition of 
the Â£finds' which was held in the Art  
Gallery over Stafford Library.         
We travelled by the latest thing in    
Stafford,the minibus, to see the oldest
finds.    The oldest things we saw were
Roman coins and a few potsherds.   Then
there were medieval coins,  a bone comb
and the remains of three large bread   
ovens.   The most popular exhibit was a
skeleton found in the dig near         
St.Mary's Church,it had rotten teeth, a
hole in its jawbone caused by          
an abscess and severe arthritis! We    
were given paper and allowed to draw   
the things we found most interesting.
