		<content> The centre is owned by the Plessey    
 Company to develop Telecommunications 
 and Defence Electronic Systems.Known  
 locally as Caswell because it was in  
 the 1940's that the centre opened     
 at Caswell House.Out of 700 employees 
 245 are graduates with high           
 qualifications.These have a support   
 staff of 107 technicians.There are    
 also 53 trainees at the centre.The    
 majority of these employees are       
 between the ages of 30 to 40          
 years.Recent building expansion       
 includes a new building for Silicon   
 integrated circuitry research.This is 
 shaped like a silicon chip,with       
 lighting in the entrance hall based on
 a molecular structure.Approx.80% of   
 staff live within a radius of 15 miles
 of Caswell and most are transported by
 coach every day.
