 Leisure time has increased for many   
 people. This has resulted in the      
 general expansion of the leisure      
 industries.Sports centres and         
 recreation grounds have increased in  
 number in the last five years. Weight 
 training and body-building have become
 popular and joggers are seen          
 everywhere. Chippenham Harriers were  
 formed two years ago and now have 100+
 members and a junior membership of    
 40+.Personal sports equipment has     
 become an element of the local fashion
 scene.The video business is booming.  
 People are able to hire films to view 
 in their own homes.Computers are used 
 both as home aids to education and    
 pleasure. Televison has brought the   
 world into the home.
