		<title>02Interview with Mrs. Page.</title>
		<content> Mrs. Page said that she had lived     
 in the village for nearly 84 years.She
 said the village had changed          
 considerably and she doesnt like it   
 now because there are too many people 
 and it is too noisy.She told us how it
 had changed.There was no crossroads   
 but instead an orchard. When Mrs. Page
 was little she went to our school but 
 it was very different.There was a     
 classroom called a gallery and 2      
 teachers one for each class.There was 
 also a horrid headmaster who spanked  
 children who were naughty with a cane 
 or a slipper.There was a very small   
 playground but there was a boys       
 playground and a girls                
 playground.There was an illness going 
 around at one time called Scarlet     
 Fever and the school had to be        
 closed.Four generations of            
 Mrs.Page's family went to the school. </content>
