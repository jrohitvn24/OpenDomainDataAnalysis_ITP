		<title>13ILLNESS AROUND TYWARDREATH</title>
		<content> If you break a bone you can be X-rayed
 at{St. Austell Hospital,}which is 5   
 miles from here, but if it is broken  
 you would have to travel to{Truro City
{Hospital}19 miles away. You often have
 to wait quite a while to be treated as
 there are lots of people there from   
 all over Cornwall. It is even{busier  
{in the summer when there are visitors}
 around who may have been sunburnt or  
 had an accident.                      
 Also at Truro is the{District General}
 called{Treliske}where you would go for
 an operation or treatment. When you go
 home, a{District Nurse}will visit you 
 on her rounds to look after you. She  
 also dresses wounds, baths old people 
 and talks to them and helps mums      
 before and after they have their      
 babies.
