		<title>12LIFE AT BRAMFORD HALL</title>
		<content>  It has a roof and I have put straw on
the floor.If I climb along a branch,I  
come to another part.It is open and    
without a roof.It has three low walls. 
If I go along the branch a bit further,
I come to another part.                
  Bramford Hall is on the outskirts of 
Bramford across the A 1100 from the    
village.                               
  Our house used to be a big mansion   
belonging to Lord and Lady Lorraine.   
They owned several big houses and      
decided that they didn't need this one 
any more.So they knocked it down,      
leaving just a little bit standing,    
which is now our house.                
  Our garden is 7.5 acres in size      
and is mainly woodland.We see a lot of 
birds and animals and flowers.In our   
garden there are three big trees.They  
are Redwood trees,the biggest in the   
world.Ours are not fully grown yet.    </content>
