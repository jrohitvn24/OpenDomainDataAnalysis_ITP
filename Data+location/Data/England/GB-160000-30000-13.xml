		<title>13A DAY IN THE LIFE OF MATTHEW</title>
		<content>                                       
 There's time for a quick game of      
 football in the playground.  Nine     
 o'clock - in we go and have an        
 Assembly to start the day. Yesterday  
 we went on a country walk and we have 
 work to do about it today. We saw many
 animals so we have to draw and write  
 about them, using library books for   
 reference.  The main birds we saw were
 ducks and lots of garden birds but I  
 liked the sparrowhawk best.           
 Ten forty - break time.  We usually   
 play bulldog or football.  Bulldog is 
 a fast game, e.g. Steven is IT and    
 people on one side have to run to the 
 other without being touched by Steven.
 We're back in at eleven and we are    
 doing maths for the rest of the       
 morning.  I like maths - it is        
 interesting.  Some of my friends are  
 on our school computer.               </content>
