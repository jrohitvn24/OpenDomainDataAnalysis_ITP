		<content> The church was opened in 1976.The     
 architect was D.J.Montague.Farmer and 
 Ball were the builders.The church     
 welcomes a variety of Religions,      
 notably, Church of England,Methodist  
 and United Reformed.They have a team  
 of four ministers.The cross in the    
 church is made of beaten copper.      
 Services are held at 10.00 on Sundays 
 with a congregation of 200 people.    
 Services were first held at the home  
 of the first minister Rev.Orchards.   
 Then two other houses were used until 
 the church building was completed.The 
 church building is not only used for  
 church services but also used by the  
 cubs,guides and play school which use 
 other rooms in this modern building.  
 The church plays a large part in the  
 local community organising coffee     
 mornings,jumble sales and other       
 activities. BY PAUL,SEAN AND MARK     </content>
