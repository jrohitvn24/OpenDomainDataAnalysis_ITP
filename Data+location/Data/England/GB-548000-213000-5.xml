		<title>05Houses in Sheering.</title>
		<content> There are two parts of{Sheering-Upper 
 Sheering,which is the older settlement
 and{Lower}Sheering.Lower Sheering was 
 built because of the railway.More     
 people began to travel to work in     
 London,so houses were built near the  
 station.                              
 There are four pubs.Three are in Upper
 Sheering,because many people travel   
 through there on the way to           
 Chelmsford.                           
 Over the last fifty years many people 
 have moved into Sheering;therefore    
 most houses are modern.The modern     
 houses are brick built with tiled     
 roofs.The older houses in the main    
 street are mostly 17th Century and    
 built from plaster and wood with tiled
 roofs.The Victorian houses are        
 terraced or semi-detached and built   
 from either red brick or plaster.Some 
 have slate roofs.                     </content>
