		<content> Norprint is certainly the largest     
 single{industrial}employer within our 
 grid,so we arranged to make a visit to
 discover just what went on there.     
 We were given a guided tour around the
 factory,which was exremely busy,and   
 full of noise.During this time,we saw 
 a whole mass of things,such as all of 
 the range of hand held{labelling      
{machines}that were made.              
 Even more interesting to us,was to see
 the{bar code}machines being used,since
 these were preparing bar code strips  
 that can be electronically scanned at 
 the till to discover the price of     
 goods,and register their sale         
 automatically.                        
 The whole company employs 1500        
 people,and during the course of a year
 their{turnover}is usually around Â£30  
 million;while making 20,000,000,000   
 labels per annum!                     </content>
