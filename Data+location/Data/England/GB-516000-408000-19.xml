		<title>19KEELBY CHURCH</title>
		<content> Keelby church is named St             
 Barthomews.It is a Parish Church and  
 every month it produces a magazine    
 called Parish News.The magazine       
 celebrates marriges,christenings and  
 comformation and mourns death.        
  The vicar is called Rev Hoggart.There
 is a choir with 19 members,adults and 
 children.There is an organist and a   
 choirmaster.                          
  As you come into the church on your  
 left hand side you will see a stained 
 glass window.It has not always been a 
 stained window,unlike the main        
 window,as we found out from the board 
 at the back.The outside isle and      
 pillars on the left are the oldest    
 part of the church as they were there 
 in Norman times.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
