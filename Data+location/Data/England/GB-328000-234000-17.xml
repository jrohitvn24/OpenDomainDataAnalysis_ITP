		<content>   In Michaelchurch one activity has   
 gone on since the{Queen's Jubilee. }  
 This is a{Sports Day,}held in the     
 field next to the school where the    
 villages of Michaelchurch, Craswall   
 and Newton St.Margarets compete       
 against each other for a shield.There 
 are all kinds of other games, a fancy 
 dress competition, decorated floats   
 and refreshments.                     
    About 4 years ago an{annual carol }
{service}was started.Each Christmas Eve
 the village turns out behind the Post 
 Office in Michaelchurch to sing carols
 and to feast on cider and mince pies. 
 Father Christmas also comes bringing  
 presents for all the children.        
     In the absence of a village hall  
 the school is used as a{community  }  
{centre}where the people hold disco's, 
 whist drives, coffee evenings and     
 barbecues.                            </content>
