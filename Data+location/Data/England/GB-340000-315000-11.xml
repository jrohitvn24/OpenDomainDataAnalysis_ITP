		<title>11VILLAGE LIFE IN SHRAWARDINE</title>
		<content> Our home is a cottage which was once  
 the house of a farm worker employed on
 the Montford Estate.  It stands       
 alongside a bridlepath which runs from
 Shrawardine to Montford, two small    
 villages south of the A5.             
                                       
 Shrawardine is a peaceful, picturesque
 village with no pub, no village hall, 
 a miniscule post office and a         
 beautiful sandstone church set on a   
 rise with a magnificent view of the   
 Welsh Breidden Hills.                 
                                       
 Village activities centre around the  
 preservation of the church and include
 annual hunter trials and a tri-annual 
 Flower Festival.  Wildlife abounds    
 along the bridleway, stoats, weasels, 
 foxes and hares being frequently seen,
 as well as yellow hammers, kestrels,  
 owls, bullfinches and many others.    </content>
