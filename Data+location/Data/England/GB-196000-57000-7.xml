		<content> The area supports a wide variety of   
 wild life.The marshy ground and       
 natural ponds provide breeding grounds
 for a variety of waterlife that       
 includes frogs,toads,newts,insects    
 such as dragonflies,caddisflies,may-  
 flies; and water voles and rats.      
 Foxes make their dens on the old      
 disused sand tips and are known to    
 make raids on poultry houses.         
 Badgers are rarely seen, but there is 
 evidence of their existence from their
 strong, aromatic territory scents and 
 their droppings.                      
 Small rodents, such as shrews, voles  
 and field mice, make their homes in   
 the natural hedges.They are the prey  
 of hawks-sparrow and buzzard.We       
 analysed some kestrel pellets found on
 a small holding and they contained the
 fur of rabbits and skeletons of small 
 rodents already mentioned.            </content>
