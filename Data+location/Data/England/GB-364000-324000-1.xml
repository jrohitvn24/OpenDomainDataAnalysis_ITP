 village is Childs Ercall, with a small
 village called Ollerton.Childs Ercall 
 has got a school a church and two     
 village halls, one of the halls is    
 used for mothers and toddlers, Bingo  
 and an old peoples club. The other    
 hall is used for disco's and community
 recreation.{In 1983 there were 596

 an old airfield and buildings _ huts  
 that were taken over by squatters than
 all buildings and huts were knocked   
 down and it was made into a council   
 estate, some of the houses have now   
 been bought by tentants.There are     
 about 12 farms in our area.The hall is
