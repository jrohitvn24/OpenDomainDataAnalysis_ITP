		<title>11BROCKHURST</title>
		<content> Brockhurst is an estate to the east of
 the A22 between East Grinstead and    
 Ashurstwood. It is very secluded and  
 can only really be seen from the      
 railway line.The farm has a fascinat- 
 ing building that serves as a dairy.  
 This dairy is very ornamental and is  
 made out of red and buff bricks laid  
 in a horizontal band.The dairy has a  
 verandah the sole purpose of which is 
 to shield the occupants from the sun. 
 Inside, the building is white-tiled   
 and this with its lancet windows makes
 the working area very cool and light. 
 The dairy has a double saddled-back   
 roof. The only building similar to    
 this in Britain is at Charthouse      
 Priory near Bath.
