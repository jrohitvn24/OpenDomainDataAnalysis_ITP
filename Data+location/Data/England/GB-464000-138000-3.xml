 Mrs Gilmour was lady in waiting to the
 Duke and Duchess of Windsor in the    
 1920s,  she liked her job a lot.When  
 Mrs Gilmour went to Australia with the
 Duke and Duchess of Windsor she had to
 help them around and carry their      
 flowers. Mrs Gilmour was on a ship    
 with the Duke and Duchess when it     
 caught fire, some people were drowned 
 but they were saved. She thought it   
 rather ordinary meeting them because  
 they were good friends already. Also  
 she met the prime minister as well as 
 the Duke and Duchess. She had to wear 
 new clothes but they did not have to  
 be very important.
