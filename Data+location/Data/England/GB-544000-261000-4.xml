 EDUCATION AUTHORITY DECIDED THAT WE   
 NEEDED MORE SCHOOLS IN CAMBRIDGE. THEY
 BUILT KINGS'S HEDGES INFANT &amp; JUNIOR  
 SCHOOLS ALONG WITH OTHERS.IN 1970     
 THERE WERE 12 TEACHERS INCLUDING A    
 HEADMASTER AND DEPUTY.NOW THERE ARE   
 EIGHT TEACHERS AND 152 CHILDREN       
 COMPARED WITH 1970 WHEN THERE WERE    
 NEARLY 300 PUPILS. DESPITE EXPENDITURE
 OF NEARLY Â£83,000. TO REPAIR          
 STRUCTURAL DEFECTS.THE SCHOOL HAS     
 NEVER BEEN FULLY WATERPROOF.THE       
 PLAYGROUND HAS AN AREA OF 2,500Msq.   
 WITH CLIMBING FRAME,HOPSCOTCH AND     
 OTHER GAMES.FOOTBALL SEEMS TO BE THE  
 MOST POPULAR GAME AND OFTEN CAUSES    
 HEADACHES FOR THE TEACHERS ON         
 PLAYGROUND DUTY.
