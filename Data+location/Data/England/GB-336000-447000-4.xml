		<content> Preesall and Knott-End Gala used to be
 held on a Bank Holiday Monday but is  
 now on the second Saturday in July.It 
 has run for over fifty years apart    
 from the war years.After the war the  
 British Legion took responsibility for
 much of the organisation.The process- 
 ion still stops for the retiring Queen
 to lay a bouquet of flowers at the War
 Memorial.The Gala has always taken the
 form of a procession of floats and    
 trailers. The present custom of       
 various organisations entering floats 
 contrasts with earlier practice in    
 which each street decorated a trailer.
 The procession is often accompanied by
 Pilling Jubilee Silver Band.After the 
 judging of the floats, fancy-dress,   
 etc we make our way to the Gala Field 
 for sports and entertainment.At the   
 end of the afternoon the children of  
 the village are given a free tea.     </content>
