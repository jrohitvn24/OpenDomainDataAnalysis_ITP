		<title>06CHURCHILL PARISH CHURCH</title>
		<content>  All Saints' Church was built in 1826 
 by Squire Langston, replacing the     
 demolished church.   Outstanding      
 features are the tower, a 2/3 replica 
 of Magdalen College, Oxford, and the  
 nave's hammerbeam roof, based on      
 Christ Church Hall, Oxford.           
  In 1971 the tower was pronounced     
 unsound, corrosion of metal supports  
 weakening the stone.   An appeal was  
 launched and Â£10,000 raised for       
 restoration.                          
  The Electoral Roll has 55 names, and 
 congregations are small for this large
 building.   The cost of upkeep is     
 high, for repairs and renewals are a  
 constant problem.   The parish is part
 of a united benefice with Sarsden,    
 Kingham and Daylesford.  A service    
 takes place in Churchill every Sunday,
 and occasionally the churches of the  
 benefice hold a combined service.     </content>
