		<content> Mr Harland's parents retired from     
 Scarborough to live in Green          
 Hammerton.After they died Mr Harland  
 bought their house.He went to work    
 in Harrogate as a chainsaw salesman.  
 He was sacked because he was not      
 selling enough chainsaws.He wanted    
 to start his own business.He converted
 his own garage into a work shop and   
 showroom.Then he started repairing    
 lawn mowers with the blacksmiths help.
 He thought "If I work in York it will 
 be too far for the people in Harrogate
 to travel to me"The people will have  
 to travel from York to Harrogate if   
  I work in Harrogate.So it will not   
 be too far to travel. Mr. Harland now 
 has a thriving business with 18 people
 working for him.  Six of these live in
 the village of Green Hammerton.
