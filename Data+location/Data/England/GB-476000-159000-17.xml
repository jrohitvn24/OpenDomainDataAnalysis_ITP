		<title>17Eversley Football Club</title>
		<content>    Eversley has a very active football
 club, which was founded over a hundred
 years ago. There are about forty-six  
 members whose ages range from         
 seventeen to forty. The club runs two 
 teams so that everyone manages to play
 in as many matches as possible. They  
 need so many members to cover for     
 injuries and unavailability. We spoke 
 to Mr. Brian Arnold, the previous     
 manager, who told us that his main    
 tasks were to motivate players,       
 supervise training sessions, pick     
 teams and assist in the general       
 running of the club. It costs Â£1000 a 
 year to keep the club going, with     
 referees, laundry bills and match fees
 to pay. The members hold discos and   
 run in sponsored marathons to raise   
 money for funds.
