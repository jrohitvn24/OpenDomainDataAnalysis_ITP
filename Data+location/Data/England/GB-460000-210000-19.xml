		<title>19Bernwode Meadows-Oakley</title>
		<content>One morning last week some of us went  
to Bernwode Meadows to study wild      
flowers.We saw some rare species and   
many common ones induding red and white
clover,ladies slipper and speedwell.The
spotted orchid had light,thin leaves   
with purple-green blotches on.Much of  
the adjoining forest is conifer.We saw 
many deer tracks and plenty of         
squirrels there.We went into the watch 
tower from where we saw several common 
birds.We had hoped to see a Purple     
Emperor butterfly as there are some in 
the forest,but were unluky on this     
occasion.We also saw on the main track,
a strange stile.It had one main gate   
like the entrance to any field and     
small fence at the side which you      
press down to climb over.              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
