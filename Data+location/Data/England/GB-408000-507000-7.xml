		<content>    Mr Alan Braithwaite took over the  
 shop from Mrs Dent in 1983 and moved  
 it to its present location next to the
 Travellers Rest public house. This pub
 was formerly named the Bay Horse - it 
 has been extended and modernised in   
 recent years and now provides good    
 restaurant facilities and attracts    
 customers from a wide area including  
 tourists. Fairfield House (Mrs Dent's 
 house), used to be the Greyhound Inn  
 and still has its cellars.            
    The village hall is well maintained
 and well supported and in regular use 
 for social gatherings, parties etc.   
    The population has remained at     
 around 120 in spite of the general    
 local tendency of young people 'born  
 and bred' in the village having to    
 move away out of necessity to find    
 work and houses which they can afford.
