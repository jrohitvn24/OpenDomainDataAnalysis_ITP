		<title>08DOUNBY FARM STUDY: FUTURE</title>
		<content> In the{future,}Mr. Hourston thinks    
 that there won't be so much work to do
 on the farm by hand. There will be a  
 lot more machines instead and less    
 workers. No-one who doesn't have a lot
 of money will be able to buy a farm.  
 Farmers will probably find it cheaper 
 to hire contractors to do some of     
 their work as they won't be able to   
 afford to buy some kinds of machinery.
 He is also worried that EEC grants    
 will stop or be cut and force him to  
 change from beef cattle.              
 The biggest problem with{farming?     
 There isn't much time off to do other 
 things.
