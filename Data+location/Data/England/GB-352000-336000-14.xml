		<content> Date line 21st. June 1985.            
 A come up and see us sometime invit-  
 ation has gone to a Shropshire C.C.   
 chairman from the village.The invit-  
 ation is part of moves by traffic     
 troubled Tilstock,where villagers     
 are campaigning for a 30mph speed     
 limit on its road,or at the least     
 "Please drive carefully"signs on its  
 main approaches.They have obtained    
 over 270 names to a petition in       
 support of their call,which local C.C.
 Mrs Paulene Collins intended giving   
 direct to Councillor Arther Hooke,    
 chairman  of the countys planning and 
 transport committee.One of the pet-   
 ition organisers Mrs P.Clorley said   
 the main source of worry was Tilstock 
 Lane carring traffic between the Wem/ 
 Whitchurch and A41/49 trunk roads     
 directly past the village school.
