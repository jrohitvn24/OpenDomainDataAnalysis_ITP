		<title>07The Doctors' Surgery, Otford</title>
		<content>                                       
   When we went to the Doctors' Surgery
our group found out quite a lot of     
useful information. For instance, the  
Surgery was built in 1968. Here are    
some other things we found out: 11     
people work there - four doctors and   
seven people in the office. The        
building has always been a surgery.    
They haven't got a computer, just a    
filing system. Not many people are sent
off to hospital immediately. Mixed     
age-groups visit them with roughly 100 
people coming to the Surgery each day. 
The secretary who answered our         
questions said that they get patients  
from most of the surrounding villages. 
There is a nurse who comes in three    
times a week to do the injections, etc.
and there are two District Nurses who .
see to the needs of the old people.
