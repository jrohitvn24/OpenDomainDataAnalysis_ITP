		<title>17CLAYTON TUNNEL</title>
		<content> The London-Brighton railway line which
 runs northward through the block      
 passes under the Downs through Clayton
 Tunnel, almost 2 km long, and emerges 
 at Clayton Village. In 1841 the Tunnel
 was finished. The route through the   
 Downs was the idea of Sir John Rennie.
 It cost Â£4O,OOO per mile, involving   
 the tunnel with its tudor fortress    
 folly as the tunnel keeper's house. In
 1861 there was the Clayton Tunnel     
 disaster. Two trains collided. 24 were
 killed, 2OO injured. New morse        
 signalling procedures nationwide were 
 set up as a result of this. The folly 
 at the end of the tunnel is still     
 inhabited. The occupier enjoys living 
 there and claims that she is not      
 disturbed by the continuous traffic   
 beneath her. Her main problem is      
 access to clean her windows. Many     
 sightseers stop to view the folly.    </content>
