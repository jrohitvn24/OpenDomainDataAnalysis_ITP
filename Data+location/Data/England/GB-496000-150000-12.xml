		<content>    Our family belongs to the{Plymouth 
{Brethren.}My name is Rowena; I am     
 eleven years old and the middle child 
 of a family of six. I seem to spend my
 spare time either reading, playing    
 board games or peeling potatoes. My   
 elder brother either plays with his   
 friends or listens to his tape        
 recorder. My older sister spends her  
 time reading, doing her school        
 homework or playing table tennis with 
 me. My three younger sisters spend    
 most of their time playing in our     
 garden. My parents do not have much   
 leisure time. Dad is a plumber and    
 spends what little spare time he has  
 gardening. Mum helps him when she can.
 Being{Brethren}we do not have a       
 television in our house. We spend most
 of our leisure time together or with  
 our friends.
