{"Chase."}                             
 In{"Chase"}you have to choose a person
 to catch the other people who are     
 playing the game and there is a "home"
 or "base".If the people are not in the
 home by the time the person who is    
 "it" touches them then they become    
 "it" (or "on", or catcher.) for the   
 next game.                            
{"Skipping."}                          
 This is how you do{"skipping."}       
 You have a skipping rope and put it   
 behind your ankles. Then you swing the
 rope over your head and then jump over
 it. It is the same doing backwards    
 skipping, but you swing the rope in   
 the opposite direction.
