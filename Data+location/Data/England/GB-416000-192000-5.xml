		<title>05COMMUNITY CENTRE,HIGHWORTH</title>
		<content> The Community Centre of Highworth was 
 opened in 1982 and is three years     
 old.It is a pratten hut which used to 
 be in a school in Swindon.It opens at 
 all sorts of times,mainly providing   
 youth clubs for various age groups,   
 and bingo and day centre facilities   
 for the elderly.Sometimes the groups  
 using the centre organize trips out   
 at weekends.It was started because    
 there was nowhere in Highworth for the
 youth and elderly to go.There is table
 tennis,pool,darts and a computer      
 available to those using the centre.  
 One salaried person  works full time. 
 That is Sue Telling,the youth and     
 community worker.
