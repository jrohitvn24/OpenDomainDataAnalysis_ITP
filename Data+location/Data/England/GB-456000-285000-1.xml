 villages.Gilmorton has a post         
 office,3 pubs,a butcher's,a pottery   
 shop,a Victorian Anglican church,a    
 recreation ground and a cricket       
 ground.Kimcote has a church and Walton
 has a post office,a                   
 pub,playing-fields,a village-hall and 
 2 chapels.                            
 Most people work out of the area and  
 visit neighbouring towns for          
 recreation and leisure activities.None
 of the villages is on a major bus     
 route .                               
 The surrounding farming land is used  
 mainly for crops,silage and grazing.
