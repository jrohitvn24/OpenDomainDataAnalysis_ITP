		<title>10ST EDMUNDS SCHOOL,FLEETWOOD</title>
		<content>    The school was originally built as 
 an infant school,and annexe to        
 St.Wulstan's,another school in        
 Fleetwood.It was built twenty-six     
 years ago and the junior wing was     
 built ten years ago.                  
    There are,at the moment,eighty-six 
 pupils and four teachers. The         
 pupils,whose ages range from five to  
 eleven years,are divided into four    
 classes each with approximately       
 twenty-two children.Each class        
 have pupils with an age range of two  
 years. The pupils mostly live in      
 Fleetwood.                            
    The school colours are red,grey and
 white. Corporal punishment is not     
 used.Most punishment is in the form   
 of discussion or loss of privileges.  
 The head's hopes for the future       
 include the employment of a part-time 
 teacher.                              </content>
