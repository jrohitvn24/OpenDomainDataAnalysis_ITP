		<content> The M.P. for our area is called       
 Douglas Hogg.He represents the        
 Conservative Party at the Houses of   
 Parliament.His job is to be a Member  
 of Parliament.He says that an M.P's   
 job,"is to express the concerns of    
 his constituents and seek to influence
 and persuade."Douglas Hogg is helping 
 the children of Branston.Their parents
 are worried about the number of       
 children who use a busy narrow road to
 cycle to the comprehensive school.He's
 trying to persuade the County Council 
 to build a cycle track between the    
 comprehensive school and the Sheep    
 wash bend near Washingborough.This is 
 important because the children ride   
 all over the road and somebody may be 
 killed.Douglas Hogg is also involved  
 in correspondence with the Anglian    
 Water Authority about chemicals in the
 water supply.                         </content>
