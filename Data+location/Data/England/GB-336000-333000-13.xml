		<title>13MODERN HOUSING. ELLESMERE</title>
		<content> There are a lot of new houses         
 springing up around Ellesmere.People  
 are building new estates in the hope  
 that more people will come and live in
 Ellesmere.That would probably mean    
 bigger shops and facilities.New houses
 are built to suit the average family, 
 with smaller rooms to make room for   
 things everybody expects in a house.  
 The council have built some new       
 council houses along Scotland Street. 
 These modern houses have all the      
 things other houses have.All the new  
 houses are built on the out skirts of 
 Ellesmere because there is no room    
 left in the centre of town.The newest 
 estate in Ellesmere is Trimpley       
 Court and the houses are very modern.
