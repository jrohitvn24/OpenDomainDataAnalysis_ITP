		<title>15Chorleywood Scout Group</title>
		<content>The 1st Chorleywood is the local Scout 
Group of nearly 300 members. It has    
four Cub Packs for 8-11 year olds and  
four Scout Troops for 11-15 year olds. 
The Headquarters is one of the largest 
in Britain with a large garage, two    
hall, kitchen and toilets. The group   
owns several canoes and a large van.   
There is also a mixed Venture Scout    
Unit which does a lot more adventurous 
activities. There is a Cub football    
league which involves teams from each  
Cub Pack and others in the District.   
The Distict also owns a campsite in the
grounds of Chorleywood House. At the   
campsite we do many evening activities 
like cooking sausages as well as       
camping for all ages. There is a small 
hall at the campsite which is used by  
Packs and Troops camping there.
