		<title>17Shops and Stalls - two</title>
		<content>  Along the A44 road through           
 Wickhamford are several fruit and     
 vegetable stalls.As you drive along   
 these stalls are very noticeable      
 because they have large blackboards   
 with writing advertising what they    
 sell.As this is a busy road each one  
 has a large parking area so that      
 vehicles can pull off the road.They   
 have attractive displays of fruit and 
 vegetables,all with the prices        
 marked.Most of the produce is grown   
 locally.These stalls are open all the 
 year and although tourists often stop 
 to buy things,most of the trade is    
 local.                                
  On the{Bond Industrial Estate}are 23 
 units. There are many types of firms  
 including kitchen furniture, a hi-fi  
 manufacturer, a U.S. clothing         
 warehouse, an inflatable equipment    
 firm supplying dingies.               </content>
