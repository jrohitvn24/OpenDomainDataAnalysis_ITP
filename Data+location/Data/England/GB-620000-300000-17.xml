		<content> Transport is very much a factor of    
 life in our area because employment   
 and facilities are mostly in Norwich, 
 or amenities and services are grouped 
 in other centres.                     
 We made a survey of which forms of    
 transport are most used.              
 Over 90% of the families have a carand
 nearly 30% supplement this with the   
 ownership of a motor cycle, moped, or 
 scooter. Less than 25% used the bus   
 services, but for those who did, it   
 was vital to have a bus service as    
 they had no other form of mechanised  
 transport.                            
 Cycling is popular and most people own
 a cycle.                              
 The roads themselves are mostly rural,
 narrow and hedge-lined. The A140 is   
 the major road although this is single
 carriage.
