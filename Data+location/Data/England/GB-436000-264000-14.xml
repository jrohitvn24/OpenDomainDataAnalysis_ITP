		<content>{  I like}living in the country because
 I have so much space to race around on
 my{BMX bike.}I am able to make my own 
 course with Whoops and Berms. I get   
 lots of fun and practice for racing.  
   I also like{fishing}and have lots   
 of smashing places nearby where       
 fishing is allowed. I also like to    
 take my{dog}for a walk, and near me   
 there is a very large wood which the  
 dog likes to run in. I do not like    
 walking along the{Fosse Way.}It is a  
 very busy road with cars going so fast
 that my dog cringes when they go past.
 The car drivers do not seem to care   
 about me when they rush past.         
{  Where I live is one of the only     
{places in England where 2 ancient     
{roads cross.  The Welsh Rd}is also a  
 busy road.  I feel sorry for all the  
 birds, hedgehogs and rabbits who get  
 killed on the road.                   </content>
