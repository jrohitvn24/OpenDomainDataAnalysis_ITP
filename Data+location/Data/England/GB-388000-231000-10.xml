		<content>  Tewkesbury is situated on the        
 confluence of the rivers Severn and   
 Avon,both of which are kept in        
 excellent order by the work of the    
 Severn Trent River Authority and the  
 Lower Avon Navigation Trust.          
  A large tourist industry has evolved 
 around the many types of boat now     
 using these rivers and Tewkesbury has 
 its own yacht marina.                 
  Around the two rivers there is a     
 large flood zone,Tewkesbury being     
 right in the middle.This has stopped  
 any expansion of the town being       
 possible, population having changed   
 little over the centuries.Workings to 
 the river banks and Tewkesbury's      
 roadways make it easier for the       
 people to travel in times of flood,   
 but on several occasions each year,the
 land between the two rivers,known as  
 'The Ham',is completely under water.  </content>
