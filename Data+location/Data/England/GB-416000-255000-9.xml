		<title>09STRATFORD FIRE STATION</title>
		<content> At the fire station they have 2 normal
 engines and an {emergency}tender      
 engine that goes out to road          
 crashes.The engines weigh 10 tons     
 without{equipment}and they cost around
 Â£65000. They carry 1800 litres of {   
{water.}There are ladders on top of the
 engines.The longest ladder is 15m and 
 there are also roof ladders which have
 wheels on so they slide easily on     
 house roofs.                          
 The engines are designed to carry{six}
{people,}the driver,the officer in     
 charge and 4 riders in the back.To get
 to the{fire}takes about 8 minutes and 
 only 5% of their calls are false      
 alarms which is quite good.Some       
 stations have junior firemen and you  
 have to be 16years, but to be a proper
{fireman}you must be 18.They practise  
 every day on a tall practice building 
 which has 4 floors.                   </content>
