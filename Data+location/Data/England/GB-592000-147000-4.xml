   Charing church is dedicated to St.  
Peter and St. Paul. It has two side    
chapels in the north and south         
transepts. In 1590 the church caught   
fire and was almost completely         
destroyed. The original roof has been  
replaced by another, the beams of      
which have been beautifully painted so 
that they look like they have been     
carved. The church has a lovely rood   
screen erected in 1921 as a memorial to
those who died in World War 1. Set in  
the wall by the main altar is a special
seat. This is where the Archbishop of  
Canterbury used to sit. Charing Church 
has this special seat because Charing  
is on the old route from London to     
Canterbury, and the Archbishop used to 
stay at his Palace, which is next door 
to the church, on his way to Canterbury
The Palace is now almost a ruin.       </content>
