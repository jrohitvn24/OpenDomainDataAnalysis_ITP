 chancel,vestry,South porch and a tower
 that is 52 feet high.In the church    
 there are eight wooden posts          
 supporting the nave arcades.The posts 
 have limestone bases.If you look at   
 the church you can see that it's in   
 the shape of a cross.                 
     There are five bells in Gedney    
 Hill church and the members of the    
 church are trying to raise money for  
  another bell.
