		<title>18Laurie Lee Interview (1)</title>
		<content> In an interview with Laurie Lee on    
 the                                   
 evening of June 15th,he expressed his 
 opinions about present day Slad.      
 When asked about the architecture he  
 said he adored the 17th century       
 buildings and thought the Victorian   
 houses were average.Although the pre  
 and post War buildings did not fit in 
 well,he felt,the more modern houses   
 were a good match and blended in well 
 with the original Slad Valley style.  
 When Laurie Lee found out that the    
 whole world was not like Slad,he      
 realised Slad was of out-standing     
 beauty and he feels it has still not  
 been exploited to this day.Although he
 sometimes feels worried about future  
 preservation,despite responsible land-
 owners,he would not like to live      
 anywhere else but Slad.
