		<content>    In the south downland,{chalk}forms 
 part of a long north/south ridge known
 as the Hog's Back. Guildford Cathedral
 stands on a site known as Stag Hill.  
 The cathedral is the dominant landmark
 and can be seen from almost every part
 of the district.                      
    In the south east corner the{River 
{Wey,}one of only 2 rivers to break    
 through the chalk of the North Downs, 
 forms a narrow but important gap      
 through the chalk ridge. This gap was 
 the main reason for the early         
 development of Guildford and the river
 still dominates the landscape.        
    Most of the area is{London Clay    
 with sandy outcrops which are not     
 very fertile and the land is mainly   
 heath. This part is flat. There is    
 dairy farming in the north west of    
 the region. The sandstone of the      
{Bagshot Beds}are present here.        </content>
