		<title>01SOUTHALL GREENFORD HANWELL</title>
		<content>      The two towns in our block are   
{Southall}and{Greenford.}We also       
 include about half of{Hanwell.}All    
 three are part of the London Borough  
 of Ealing. There is a lot of parkland 
 along the four kilometers of the River
 Brent, which runs through this area,  
 plus nearly a square kilometre of open
 land beside the Grand Union Canal.    
      Southall has one of the largest  
 Asian communities in the country.     
 People say that almost anything you   
 can buy in India, you can buy in      
 Southall. Despite some factory        
 closures there are many different     
 local enterprises. Workers not        
 employed locally mostly commute into  
 London or Heathrow Airport.           
      Although people know that in some
 respects conditions could be better,  
 there is a quiet pride among people of
 all cultures at the area's successes. </content>
