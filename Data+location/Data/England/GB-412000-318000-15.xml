		<title>15YOXALL_SCHOOL TRAFFIC SURVEY</title>
		<content> St.Peter's Primary School is on a     
 bend;we have a crash barrier to       
 prevent vehicles mounting the pavement
 On Sept.9th,class 6 took a traffic    
 census and were surprised to find so  
 much.There were 1139 cars and 456     
 other vehicles,42 bicycles,335        
 pedestrians all between 9am and 3.30pm
 Bicycles carefully wove their way     
 around the dangerous corner as large  
 lorries zoomed past.Lorries dashed in 
 a racing competition around the bend, 
 grinding to a halt when other lorries 
 raced near.Other lorries stopped with 
 trouble and tried to negociate the    
 kerb.Bicycles clicked gently passed.  
 Motor bikes acccelerated around the   
 corner leaning to the side recklessly.
 I hope one day my thoughts will be    
 read and perhaps there will be a by-  
 pass which has been needed for 40     
 years.  Jane Wright,Tim Bernard age 11</content>
