		<content>{Mrs X}is a woman in her late 50s who  
 lives in a lovely{detached mock Tudor 
{house}with a big oak door. She spends 
 much of her time away from home       
 visiting her mother who is ill in     
 hospital, so she is not involved in   
 many social activities. She plays the 
 piano and cello and plays chamber     
 music sometimes. She is married with 2
 children, both grown up and living    
 away from home. Her husband is        
 retired. Their house is well furnished
 with traditional styled furniture. She
 thinks the local transport services   
 are not very good, but she uses her   
 own car for travelling.               
{Mrs A}lives in a{council house}made of
 red brick. She lives with her husband 
 and 2 dogs. Although they are retired 
 they run a local football club which  
 has games winter and summer. She also 
 thinks that public transport is poor. </content>
