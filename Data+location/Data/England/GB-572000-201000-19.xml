		<title>19GREAT MASCALLS FARM C'FORD</title>
		<content>   A house has been on this site since 
 the 13th century.The present owners   
 inherited the farm from their father  
 in 1968.In 1937,in their granfather's 
 time,there were 250 acres and 13 men  
 to work them.They grew potatoes,oats, 
 beans and peas.Now there are 650acres 
 though 24 have been taken for the New 
 Chelmsford By Pass.Now four men work  
 on the farm and they grow wheat,barley
 peas and rape.As well as crops and a  
 dairy herd of 80 cows,they have a few 
 sheep and turkeys at Christmas time.  
 In 1937 it took a man with a pair of  
 horses a day to plough a field.Now a  
 combine harvester ploughs 3/4 acres an
 hour.In 1937 one man looked after 12  
 cows, now one man looks after 80.In   
 1937 an average wage was about Â£1.25  
 a week,now it is about Â£100.
