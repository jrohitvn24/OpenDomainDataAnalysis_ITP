  At about midnight on 6th September   
 1981 the residents of Carrbrook       
 Village, Stalybridge, Cheshire were   
 awakened by a series of loud          
 explosions. As they rushed to their   
 doors to investigate they saw the sky 
 lit up by what appeared to be a       
 gigantic fireworks display; objects   
 were being thrown into the air and    
 exploding, cascading their fiery      
 contents over the surrounding houses. 
  Police evacuated people from the area
 as deadly fumes from the fire, at the 
 Chemstar Chemical Works, spread across
 the Village.                          
  The fire was only one of many to     
 occur around this time and great      
 concern was expressed that such       
 dangerous chemicals should be stored  
 in densely populated areas.
