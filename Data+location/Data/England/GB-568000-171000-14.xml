		<title>14  SHORNE PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Shorne school is a small primary      
 school. The good thing about a small  
 school is that you get to know        
 everyone. The present school was built
 in 1972 and there were about 160      
 children. There are now only 90       
 children with 4 class teachers and the
 headmaster. The school is connected   
 with the church and the vicar takes   
 assembly each Friday. There is an     
 orchard around the school.            
  The school has a Parent teachers     
 association which raises money for the
 school to buy things. It has bought 3 
 computers and monitors as well as a   
 video and television. The school      
 attracts children from the nearby     
 towns due to the close knit atmosphere
 of the small school.
