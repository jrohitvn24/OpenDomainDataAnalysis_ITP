		<content> The Meridian Post started about four  
 years ago.It is run by a  comittee of 
 people who give ideas and help with   
 the typing and running of the paper.  
  It is a free paper and four years ago
 would have given 5000 copies out but  
 now they give out around 1400 copies  
 because of rising production costs.   
  There are a lot of old people in     
 Peacehaven and the Meridian Post is a 
 good way of connecting them with the  
 out-side world.                       
  The people who work for the Meridian 
 Post work entirely voluntarily.The    
 paper needs advertisements to keep in 
 business.An advert 14cm by 7cm would  
 cost Â£41 and one 9.5cm by 5.5cm would 
 cost Â£21.An advert on the front or    
 back page costs more money than one in
 the inside.
