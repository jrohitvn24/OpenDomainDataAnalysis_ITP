		<title>08THE LOCAL ROADS.</title>
		<content> Two tarmacadam roads run through this 
 section, rising from 625ft. to 1159ft.
   Mount Road runs west with stone     
 built owner occupied and council      
 housing on either side.  After 1 mile 
 it becomes a moorland road meeting the
 A62 at Standedge.                     
   Binn Road commences at the same 4   
 spur roundabout and goes south        
 rising to 875ft.  This road trails off
 to a footpath which leads onto the    
 moorland.  Housing is found on either 
 side of the road and are again stone  
 built properties.  There are 3        
 cul-de-sacs of mill houses on one side
 of this road and a small road giving  
 access to the mill on the other side. 
   Access via a flight of 162 stone    
 steps cut into the hillside descends  
 to the base of Butterley Reservoir.
