		<content>{TELEVISION}now occupies a major part  
 of our lives.We found that most       
 children watched from three hours a   
 day upwards. In our area nearly every 
 home had a television and many had    
 two or three or more. Televisions were
 found in many rooms including the     
 lounge,kitchen and bedrooms. One of   
 the most popular soap opera's is      
 Dallas, its about an oil company with 
 people fighting over money. Another   
 good programme is Different Strokes,  
 its about two black boys,one called   
 Arnold and one called Willis.They were
 adopted by a white man. It is very    
 funny. 92% of people have got TV sets.
                                       
{RADIO -}nearly every home in this area
 has a radio. There are four national  
 channels plus two local stations.
