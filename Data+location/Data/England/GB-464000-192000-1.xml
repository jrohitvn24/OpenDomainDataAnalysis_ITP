		<content> Britwell Salome and the adjoining     
 village of Upperton and Brihtwell     
 Baldwin orm quiet, friendly rural     
 communities.  The nearest towns are   
 Watlington and Wallinford.  The       
 population of all three villaes is    
 small and consists of families and    
 eldely people.  Several people have   
 lived there for many years.  The area 
 consists of arm-land, farm buidings   
 and houses.  Britwell and Brihtwell   
 Baldwin both have a parish church, and
 a public house.  Brightwell Baldwin   
 also has a little shop which contains 
 a post office.  The old school in     
 Brightwell  Baldwin is now a private  
 house.  Children in all the villages  
 come by coach to school in Watlington.
