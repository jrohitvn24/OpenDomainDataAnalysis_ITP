		<content> This story concerns Daggers Gate and  
 the supposed powers attributed to a   
 witch to "overlook" someone, to work  
 evil by taking the form of a hare to  
 torment that person.                  
 A woman living at Sleight in 1789 was 
 described as a witch. A farmer had had
 poor luck for years.An enormous doe   
 was seen to come from Sleight and was 
 shot and wounded by him.The witch     
 subsequently appeared lame.The doe was
 later killed by a shepherd, whereupon 
 the farmer found the witch dead. A    
 witch could not be buried in the      
 Churchyard so she was buried at       
 Daggers Gate.                         
 Years later the farmer was killed by a
 mad woman on his way home from market 
 at the same spot. He is said to haunt 
 the scene of his murder.
