		<title>19 The Changing Village...cont</title>
		<content>  At Milton Common the householders    
have been affected by the building of  
the M40 close to their homes.In        
particular they have to endure         
considerable traffic noise and exhaust 
fumes 24 hours a day.The lessening of  
traffic on the A40 has resulted in     
further ribbon development on sites    
close to the road.Those concerned with 
service industries have gained         
additional business from the motorway. 
  In general Village shops have closed 
due to competition from supermarkets   
elsewhere.In Haseley The Post Office   
opens for one hour only on Thursday    
mornings.The travelling shop and fish  
and chip van are eagerly greeted by the
villagers.They also support the mobile 
library van which comes once a week.   
  The village pub is traditionally a   
centre of village life.
