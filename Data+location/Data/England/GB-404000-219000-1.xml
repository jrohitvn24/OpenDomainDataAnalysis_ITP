		<title>01GENERAL PAGE SALPERTON AREA</title>
		<content> This is a traditional limestone       
 cotswold landscape,totally            
 agricultural,sparsely populated and   
 little changed over the last half     
 century.The land is mostly in the     
 hands of a few large estates and gives
 an air of care and prosperity .There  
 is one village with its large house   
 and estate ,a farm hamlet,another farm
 with attendant cottages and a few     
 smaller holdings.Almost all the       
 population of working age is connected
 with the land,apart from half a dozen 
 who work in nearby towns or have      
 holiday homes there.There are no      
 Service industries.Four Civil Parishes
 ,Hazleton,Hawling,Sevenhampton and    
 Shipton converge.Population is well   
 below the district ave. of 0.60 per   
 hectare.It is likely to remain fairly 
 static apart from a possible increase 
 in holiday/second home purchase.      </content>
