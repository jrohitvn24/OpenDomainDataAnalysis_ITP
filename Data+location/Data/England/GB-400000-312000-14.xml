		<title>14MY VILLAGE: HAZEL SLADE</title>
		<content> {Hazel Slade} is a very quiet village 
on the edge of{Cannock Chase}, which is
designated as an area of outstanding   
natural beauty. The Chase is owned     
mainly by the Forestry Commission as a 
commercial forest but people can enjoy 
it for walks, picnics and nature study.
  Hazel Slade has a number of          
amenities. It has two parks, a nature  
reserve, a public house with a garden, 
a general shop, and a Post Office, so  
most essential items can be bought in  
the village.                           
  The park equipment is usually damaged
so when I get home I often watch       
television or play my records. It can  
be dangerous to walk alone in concealed
areas, but generally Hazel Slade is a  
pleasant and peaceful place to live.
