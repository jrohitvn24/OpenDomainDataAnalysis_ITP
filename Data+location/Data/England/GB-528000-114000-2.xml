 opened in 1980. Its facilities        
 include a chiropodist, a meals on

 cost 75p.                             
  The centre cost Â£83,000 to build,    
 and each year the catering bill is    
 about Â£8,000. The gas and electricity 
 bills come to approximately Â£5,500.

 which covers just under half. The rest
 is raised by fund raising events. In  
 1983 a new extension to the centre    
 was opened.                           
  The centre opens on Monday, Wednesday
 and Thursday until 2.30pm. On Tuesday 
 and Friday it is open for coffee only.
 Each day the centre opens at 10.00 am.
