 and Baldock. In addition to the

 segregated from goods and services    
 traffic. Levels 5 to 11 are occupied  
 by the main ward units. Each floor has
 sixty been arranged in four 15 bed    
 units each having three 4 bed wards   
 and three single wards grouped around 
 a nurses station for easy observation.

 levels 1 to 4.  The new{maternity}wing

 surroundings with Habitat-style decor,
 coupled with excellent medical care.
