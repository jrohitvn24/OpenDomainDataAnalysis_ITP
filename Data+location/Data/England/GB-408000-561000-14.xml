		<title>14THE RIVERSIDE WALK, PRUDHOE</title>
		<content> The date is the 7/5/85, a bright blue 
 sky and a lovely day for a walk along 
 the banks of the Tyne. Starting at the
 newly built centre which gives        
 information about the animals you may 
 see on the 2_3 mile walk, millions of 
 flowers are seen growing in clumps    
 along the grass. Gay, waving flowers  
 from gorse bushes mingle with the     
 gishing of the river, which holds     
 brown trout, eels, dace and salmon,   
 plus many more which a fisherman      
 enjoys catching on a peaceful day.    
 On the banks of the Tyne lie pinkkk   
 and white pebbles all different shades
 and shapes. Much of the grassland is  
 grazed by cattle, and to protect new  
 areas from stock, temporary fencing   
 has been necessary until the trees    
 become established.                   
                                       
                                       </content>
