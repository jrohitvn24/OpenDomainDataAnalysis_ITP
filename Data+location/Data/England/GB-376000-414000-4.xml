		<title>04DAIRYING IN RAMSBOTTOM</title>
		<content> Most of the farms in the Ramsbottom   
 area are{dairy farms}which provide    
 local people with their milk and dairy
 products. A girl in our form lives on 
 such a farm.                          
 "We get up at 5 o'clock each day and  
 go out on two{milk rounds.}We have 44 
 cows which we milk twice a day- at 8  
 a.m. and 4 p.m.  We have to bottle the
 milk, wash the milking parlour and    
 clean the dirty bottles. After milking
 the cows are put in the fields. We    
 also have geese, ducks, sheep and     
 dogs. We go to bed early because of   
 our early rise. We milk by machine.   
 Most of the work on the farm is done  
 by the family itself. We buy our      
 cattle at the local{cattle market}at  
 Haslingden."
