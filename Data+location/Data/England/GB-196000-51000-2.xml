		<content> St. Mewan County Primary School is set
 on the edge of St. Austell in gentle  
 Cornish countryside. The children come
 mainly from the west side of the town 
 and the surrounding villages.         
 It is the largest primary school in   
 Cornwall with 18 classes and 570      
 children currently on roll. St. Mewan 
 is a traditional primary school with  
 an infant section taking children from
 the age of four &amp; a half and a junior 
 section with children up to their 11th
 year when they transfer to one of the 
 three local comprehensive schools.    
 Including the Headmaster there are 20 
 staff.The school places great emphasis
 on the 3 R's and has a fine reputation
 for its sporting achievements.        
 The school soon outgrew the original  
 Victorian buildings and the extensions
 which began in the early 1960's were  
 completed in 1972.       (Avis Martin)</content>
