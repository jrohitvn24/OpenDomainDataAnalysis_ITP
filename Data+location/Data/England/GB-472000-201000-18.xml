		<title>18Ghosts:Chinnor and Sydenham</title>
		<content>   There are a number of tales of      
 supernatural occurrences in our area. 
   A young baby is believed to have    
 died in an inn called 'The Bird in    
 Hand' in Chinnor; the sound of its    
 crying has been heard several times.  
 Once the sound was so strong that the 
 police were called, in the belief that
 there was a living child on the       
 premises. These officers also heard   
 the weeping but despite a thorough    
 search no child was found.            
   Two ghosts stalk Sydenham; one      
 haunting Sewell's Lane-a track linking
 the village with the Lower Icknield   
 Way. People occasionally experience 'a
 cold, ghostly feeling' on this lonely 
 thoroughfare. The other ghost lurks at
 Stert crossroads where once a carriage
 overturned killing all who rode in it.
 Subsequently, suicides, fatalities    
 etc have regularly occurred.          </content>
