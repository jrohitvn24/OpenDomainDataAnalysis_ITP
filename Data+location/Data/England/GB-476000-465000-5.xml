		<content>{   PHEASANT}shooting occurs in this   
 area.The 3000 acre local Estate,this  
 year,bought 650 day-old ckicks in     
{MARKET WEIGHTON}to rear.For a week,   
 they are kept in small pens,warmed by 
 gas heaters and fed on pellets made in
{TADCASTER.}They are moved on to large,
 plastic-covered pens,called Sunhouses,
 still heated,giving them more room.   
 This is the hardest time for the Game-
 keeper since the birds "shock" very   
 easily.After 3 weeks,the heat is      
 turned off to harden the Pheasants.   
    After 5 more weeks they are put in 
 open-topped "Release Pens" with their 
 wings clipped.They moult,grow new wing
 feathers,then fly off,but still return
 to be fed on{WHEAT}grain.             
    The 'keeper may only deter{Foxes } 
 because they,too,are hunted,but he can
 set traps for smaller vermin, such as 
 rats, stoats and weasels.             </content>
