		<title>09St. Michael's church.</title>
		<content> The idea of having a new modern church
 was the villagers.The new church was  
 designed by Edward Edgecombe and was  
 built in twelve months.The bricks for 
 the church were burnt on the common   
 land at Breadon Heath,and the slates  
 came from Glyn Quarry,Denbigh.The     
 newest vicar at Welshampton is Mr     
 Durnell and he has been here for about
 two years.The new church was built in 
 1868,and called St.Michael's church.  
 The average size of the congregation  
 is now about 20,and there is a service
 held once every Sunday.Mr Durnell,the 
 vicar,shares his time between 4       
 churches.The best attendance during   
 the year is the Harvest Festival.The  
 church wardens look after the building
 and the church yard.One is Mr Durnells
 warden,and the other is to represent  
 the people.The P.C.C. is the people   
 who run the church.                   </content>
