		<title>17FISHING IN LYME REGIS</title>
		<content> Fishing in Lyme Regis has changed a   
 lot in the last 100 years. Since the  
 engine was invented the population of 
 boats has risen by hundreds. Lyme     
 Regis is a very crowded town for it is
 very popular having a sandy beach and 
 sea fishing.                          
 Most people who come to Lyme Regis    
 have never fished before so they are  
 only too pleased to pay for a trip.   
 Many fish are caught each year from   
 sharks to little mackerel but my      
 father often says he is fishing the   
 grounds of the younger generation.
