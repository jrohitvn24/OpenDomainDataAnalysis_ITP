		<title>13TWO NURSERY GARDENS</title>
		<content> Though there are no garden centres in 
 our block, we do have two interesting 
 nurseries. An old established family  
 firm in{Little Bytham}grows a wide    
 range of trees, shrubs, fruit, house  
 plants and perennials. It sells from  
 the nursery and at markets in Melton  
 Mowbray and Stamford, and has an      
 excellent reputation locally.         
  The{Careby}nursery, specialising in  
 rare and interesting plants and native
 wild flowers , opened in 1983. It     
 trades mainly by mail order. Many of  
 its clients are specialist plant      
 collectors, or have famous old        
 gardens. It also supplies schools,    
 botanic gardens and local authorities.
 Its frequent exhibits at Royal        
 Horticultural Society shows in London 
 have received many awards. The gardens
 at Careby Manor are open to the public
 from April to September.              </content>
