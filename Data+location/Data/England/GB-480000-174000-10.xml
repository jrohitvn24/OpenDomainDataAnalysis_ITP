		<title>10Where I Live</title>
		<content>   My house is in{Milley Road}in       
{Waltham St Lawrence}.  I live here    
 with my mother, father and my younger 
 sister.  The house has a living room, 
 a dining room, a breakfast room and a 
 kitchen downstairs and four bedrooms  
 and a bathroom upstairs.  We have just
 had an{extension}built on our house to
 make it bigger.  We have still got    
 lots of decorating to do.             
                                       
   When we moved into our house the    
 garden was completely wild with grass 
 about five feet high.  Now we have a  
 swing and a tree house and there are  
 flower and vegetable patches and a    
 greenhouse for growing things.        
                                       
   I like where I live because there is
 countryside all round and I can go for
 nice walks along the{footpaths}.
