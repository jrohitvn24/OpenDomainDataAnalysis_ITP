		<content>    Killer Wink: is a game that is easy
 to understand.                        
 Everybody stands in a circle.Somebody 
 out of the circle volunteers to be the
 detective, and she goes and hides.    
 While she is hiding somebody is picked
 to be the killer.Everybody decides on 
 one person.The person who is chosen   
 walks round the outside of the circle 
 and she has to tap someone on the back
 and go back to her place.  The        
 detective is called out, the detective
 walks round the inside of the circle, 
 while she is doing this the person    
 that has been tapped on yhe back must 
 begin to wink at the people that are  
 making the circle without the         
 detective seeing them. When the people
 see somebody winking at them they must
 fall to the ground, but be careful, if
 the detective sees you she will       
 say"It's you".The person left is it.  </content>
