		<content>  186 households use the village shop. 
 Many of these draw their pension or   
 family allowance at this shop/P.O.    
 because it is convenient. 11 never use
 the shop and 5 do so only very        
 occasionally. Most of those who seldom
 or never use it say the prices are too
 high but others say that the          
 commodities they require are not      
 available there.                      
  173 households use supermarkets and  
 only 16 do not. 175 feel that it is   
 cheaper to travel to shop, even       
 including the cost of transport.      
  85 households have a milkman call and
 45 do not. They get their milk either 
 from the farm or a supermarket.
