		<title>06KINGSCLERE ACTIVITIES</title>
		<content>  There are lots of activities in      
 Kingsclere, such as clubs and groups  
 for leisure-time activity. There is a 
{Gardening Association,}which runs     
 flower shows twice a year, and sells  
 seeds and tools and plants.           
  There are{keep-fit classes}to keep   
 you fit and healthy.                  
  Many ladies belong to the{Women's    
{Institute,}where they hear talks on   
 various subjects.                     
  Some people serve on the{Parish      
{Council}to help the village and its   
 inhabitants. They give a lot of time  
 to make the village a better place.   
  There are{jumble sales.}At these we  
 buy clothes, toys, sweets and cakes,  
 and raise money for different causes. 
  The{Community Association}is trying  
 to raise money at present for a new   
 centre, as we have no large hall for  
 village meetings.                     </content>
