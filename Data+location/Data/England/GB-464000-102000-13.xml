		<content>   Major road routes sculpture three   
 sides of our grid.Along the western   
 edge is the entire M275 Motorway.Ten  
 years old, it has speeded the growth  
 of Portsmouth's Continental Ferry     
 services.It has literally paved the   
 way for tidying up the Tipner side of 
 the Harbour.                          
    The M275 links with the M27,and    
 both were built on land reclaimed from
 the harbour mud-flats using the city's
 rubbish plus chalk from Portsdown     
 Hill.From both roads the views are    
 full of interest.                     
   Beneath the M27, Portsbridge round- 
 about marks the original crossing into
 Portsmouth.With its huge bus depot and
 six major roads it is still a vital   
 transport centre.                     
   Eastwards the M27 joins the Eastern 
 Road, the dual-carriageway to         
 Southsea.                             </content>
