    When asked what people did in their
 spare time, 50% of them said they     
 enjoyed gardening, others spent time  
 reading, sewing, walking, playing     
 sport, visiting the theatre, listening
 to music and watching the television. 
    As well as the sports clubs which  
 we mentioned on page 2, there are five
 public houses in the village. Three of
 them have restaurants and many people 
 come to the village to eat in them.   
    A youth club is held weekly in the 
 village hall and is run by a local    
 parent. However there is little else  
 to occupy the youngsters of the       
 village. They go to neighbouring towns
 or villages to the Brownies, Guides,  
 Cubs and Scouts. Dancing classes take 
 place in Preston and Hitchin.
