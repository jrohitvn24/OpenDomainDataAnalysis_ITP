		<content> When Neolithic farmers built their    
 great ceremonial circle of Arbor Low  
 high up on Middleton Moor and raised  
 barrows for their dead on the         
 surrounding hill tops, the region now 
 occupied by the civil parish of       
 Middleton an Smerrill must have been a
 populous centre of regional culture.  
 Now the area has a population of only 
 about 150. Of the medieval village of 
 Smerrill only the great grange farm   
 survives.                             
 During the period of the Civil War,   
 Sir Christopher Fullwood, whose castle
 was at Middleton, became the chief    
 royalist supporter in the area. He was
 subsequently killed while escaping    
 from a parliamentary search party in  
 Bradford Dale. The chief industry in  
 the 18th and 19th centuries was lace  
 making. There was also a bobbin mill, 
 and work in agriculture and lead mines</content>
