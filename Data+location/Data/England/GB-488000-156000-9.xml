		<title>09The Frimley Fuel Allotments</title>
		<content>   The Fuel Allotments form a stretch  
 of woodland joining heathland, owned  
 by the army, called the Ranges. From  
 Elizabethan times the poor people of  
 the district were allowed to go there 
 and gather wood for fuel, hence the   
 name.                                 
   The trees are generally conifers,   
 although there are quite a number of  
 Silver Birch, Oak, and Goat Willow.   
   The ground is mainly sandy with     
 stony black soil, many small streams  
 and marshes covered with algae.       
   There are many different insects:   
 two species of ladybird (the seven    
 spotted and an orange spotted) and    
 black beetles. But the most common    
 insects are the wood ants. One ant    
 hill, stretching from 70cm above      
 ground level to 1m below, can contain 
 more ants than the world's biggest    
 city contains people.                 </content>
