		<title>04THE ECOLOGY OF SHALBOURNE-2</title>
		<content> The farmland provides rich feeding for
 flocks of rooks, jackdaws and collared
 doves and for visiting hordes of wild 
 pigeon; in winter these are often     
 joined by large groups of plover,     
 fieldfare and redwing. Predators      
 include kestrel and sparrow hawks,    
 magpies and jays with passing buzzards
 and an occasional hobby. A shallow    
 brook provides a passage for migrants 
 such as sandpipers, greenshanks, water
 rail, warblers and flycatchers. Snipe 
 and many duck are winter residents.   
 All the common{butterflies}are found  
 - some 22 species. Among the numerous 
{moth population}there are at least 6  
 varieties of hawk moths.{Wildflowers  
 abound in hedges and roadside verges  
 which have benefitted from economies  
 in public services but which are      
 always at risk from some careless use 
 of farming sprays.                    </content>
