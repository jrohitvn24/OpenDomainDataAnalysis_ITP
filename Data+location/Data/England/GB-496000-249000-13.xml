		<title>13Stagsden Bird Gardens</title>
		<content> The garden opened in 1965 and was one 
 of the first Bird Zoos.It started from
 a small collection of pheasants but   
 today over 150 species of bird can be 
 seen including Cranes, Owls, Parrots, 
 Birds of Prey, and old breeds of      
 poultry.Pheasants still figure        
 prominently and large numbers are     
 still bred here each year as many     
 species are very rare in the wild and 
 it is therefore important to build up 
 reserves of stock in captivity.       
 In May 1985 the garden received an    
 award from the National Federation of 
 Zoo Gardens of Great Britain and      
 Ireland for the first captive breeding
 in the U.K. of 3 Common Cranes (Grus  
 Grus).                                
 The garden is often visited by        
 schools.
