		<content> Most Pubs in Somerset have skittle    
 alleys. I have played in one  out     
 of doors, against bales of straw.     
 The formation is one small pin at the 
 front, then two more behind, then     
 another two with a big skittle  in    
 the middle, then another two, then    
 one.                                  
 The object is to knock down as many as
 possible of the nine pins with three  
 balls which are usually rough.The     
 floors are usually quite uneven. Some 
 people can get all the pins down      
 in one or two shots and are then      
 allowed to have another go.

 Our village has a playing field with a
 pavilion used by the local football   
 and cricket clubs. The school plays   
 football and rounders there. There is 
 also a rugby club near the A 38,a     
 nearby road.                          </content>
