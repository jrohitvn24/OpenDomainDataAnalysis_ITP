		<content> Chertsey has a mixture of woods,      
 fields, open and urban areas. The     
 houses are of varied character, and   
 includes small blocks of flats, old   
 large detached houses, and            
 maisonettes. The buildings in the town
 are of different ages because Chertsey
 has been settled for a long time. Some
 of the oldest buildings are the       
 churches, several pubs, Abbey Barn and
 the old Town Hall. The shops along    
 Guildford Street are varied, and      
 change their functions regularly.     
 Chertsey has several small estates for
 light and assembly industries, which  
 use large warehouse-type buildings.   
 The only "heavy" industry in the area 
 is gravel extraction. The M25 and M3  
 just outside Chertsey have a visual   
 impact on the scenery and have        
 increased noise and pollution.
