		<title>01Summary of area</title>
		<content> This is an area dominated almost      
 entirely by farming.There are 32 farms
 or farmhouses and two villages,       
 Leysters and Kimbolton ,as well as a  
 number of tiny hamlets.               
       The farming is mixed with       
 livestock, particularly cattle and    
 sheep, most important.this means      
 that most fields are down to grass and
 the landscape is a patchwork of fields
 and hedgerows with deciduous woodland 
 still very much in evidence.          
        Most people work on the land or
 in the nearby market town of          
 Leominster. Public transport is almost
 non-existent so everyone relies on    
 cars, the only exception being the    
 school minibus which provides free    
 transport to school for some children.
