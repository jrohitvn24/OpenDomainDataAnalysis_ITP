		<content> One of the main assets of an area is  
 its housing stock and the conditions  
 of such houses also provides a good   
 indicator as to the general health of 
 the residents. Our block contains     
 about 23,000 homes;about 70% terraced 
 houses,many built in the early 1900's,
 and semi-detached houses mainly built 
 in the 1930's and most privately      
 owned.There are several estates in    
 Netherton built in the 1960's and     
 1970's.                               
 There are about 8,000 owner occupied  
 properties,about 10,000 properties    
 rented from the council and the       
 remainder rented from private         
 landlords.                            
 Ten General Improvement Areas and     
 Housing Action Areas have been        
 declared in the Bootle area and in    
 1984 about 2,000 improvement grants   
 were issued.                          </content>
