		<title>18Entertainment - The Fair</title>
		<content> When the fair comes to the village    
 green (2 or 3 times a year),my friends
 Helen and Tanya call for me at about  
 6.30p.m.When we get there we meet the 
 rest of our friends. When we arrive   
 there aren't many people but it soon  
 fills up. First of all we go on the{  
{ Waltzer.}The Waltzer is a circle of  
 separate booths that spin around when 
 the circle starts moving. Next we go  
 on the{Umbrellas}which are seats that 
 hang from the air and go round.Then we
 go on the{Dodgems}which are cars that 
 hold two people and you try to dodge  
 the other cars. Then we go on the     
{ Mexican Hat}which is a lot of seats  
 fixed onto each other in the shape of 
 a mexican hat.This goes up and down   
 and around. At about 9.30pm feeling   
 sick and without any money left we go 
 home.                                 
                                       </content>
