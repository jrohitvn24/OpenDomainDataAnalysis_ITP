		<content>  {The Bell Inn}is situated in the     
 middle of the village.  It is a very  
 old building dating back to the       
 fourteenth century.  It is a popular  
 tourist attraction in the village     
                                       
   The pub is made of plaster and brick
 with an {oak frame}.  There is a large
 garden at the back with a nice gravel 
 drive.  As well as selling drinks you 
 can also buy food at the pub if you   
 want to.                              
                                       
   The Bell is especially interesting  
 as it is administered by a{parish     
{trust}.  The inhabitants of the parish
 and their heirs were made trustees in 
 1608 with all rents and benefits going
 to the poor and needy people of the   
 parish.  This means that the landlord 
 of the Inn is a tenant.
