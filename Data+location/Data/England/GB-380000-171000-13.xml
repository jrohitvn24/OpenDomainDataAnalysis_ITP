		<title>13A Day In The Life Of Claire</title>
		<content> I am ten years old and go to Colerne  
 Primary School. I wake up at 7:15am   
 when I get out of bed. I get washed   
 the cold water dribbling down my face 
 wakes me completely then I get        
 dressed. I have my breakfast and do my
 piano practice. At 8:00am we are taken
 to a friends because mum and dad are  
 at work. We play untill 8:55am when we
 go to school. At school we are doing a
 Domesday Project which involves lots  
 of trips, my favourite trip is the    
 Daubeneys visit. At 3:15pm school     
 ends, we are picked up and then mum   
 comes to fetch us. Then I have my tea.
 At 5:00pm I go for my violin lesson, I
 like it although it does not always   
 make a nice noise. Next I go to       
 Guides. At 8:00pm I fall exhausted    
 into bed.                             
                                       
                                       </content>
