		<content> A lot of people have bad feelings     
 about Walthamstow as the litter spoils
 a lot of the nice scenery. Another    
 thing is the car fumes which pollute  
 the air as the traffic along the Lea  
 Bridge Road is very busy.             
   In Walthamstow,people from all over 
 the world come to live. The majority  
 of them are Chinese,Asians and West   
 Indians alongside Europeans.          
 Walthamstow has a well known beauty   
 spot and Conservation Area by         
 St.Mary's Church which was built in   
 the 13th Century. There is a terrace  
 of Almshouses which in 1527 were built
 to house poor folks and widows. The   
 Ancient house built in the 15th       
 Century has changed little apart from 
 careful restoration work. There are   
 also many other buildings of          
 historical value.
