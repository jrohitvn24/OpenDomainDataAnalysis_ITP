		<content>  We asked the same five old people    
 about the changes which had taken     
 place in their villages . One of the  
 Middleton ladies said that the biggest
 change had been the coming of         
{electricity}and the{mains water       
 supply. She could remember fetching   
 water from the village pump.          
  All said that the two villages are   
 now much larger, but that village     
 facilities have declined.  At North   
 Runcton the school has closed and the 
 bus service was withdrawn three years 
 ago. At Middleton there are fewer     
 shops and local businesses have       
 changed. The wheelwrights shop is now 
 a garage,but that is about to close   
 becuse of declining business.         
  All agreed that they used to shop in 
 Kings Lynn more often than now. For   
 example one now goes once every       
 fortnight instead of once a week.     </content>
