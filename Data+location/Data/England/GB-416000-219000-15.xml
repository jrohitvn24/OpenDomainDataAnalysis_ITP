		<content> The most{notable event}during the year
 is the{Bourton Carnival}when there is 
 a procession of floats and music from 
 a local band. The carnival is led by a
 float on which the{Beauty Queen}and   
 the{2 Princesses}stand. This is then  
 followed by other floats which are    
 made by different groups, for example 
 primary schools, Hockey Club, Rugby   
 Club and Pubs which all have a        
 different float within a general set  
 theme.                                
 Another event that takes place        
 annually, each November, is the       
{Memorial Service}which remembers the  
 dead of the two World Wars. It is     
 always well attended by young and old 
 alike.                                
 In Wyck Rissington the local people   
 always hold a{Church Fete}in August   
 and a similar event takes place in    
 Bourton in July.                      </content>
