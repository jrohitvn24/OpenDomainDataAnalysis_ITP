		<title>18BIRDS IN ELMSTEAD AREA.</title>
		<content>    During June 1985 we visited three  
 locations in our area,one  was near a 
 wood the second on farmland near      
 Bromley Brook and the last location   
 was an area round Elmstead Church.We  
 saw a lot of summer visitors ,mostly  
{swifts,swallows}and a few{house       
{martins}catching insects in the air.  
 Flocks of{rooks}were seen flying over 
 the fields and feeding.Large numbers  
 of{sparrows}were nesting in the church
 tower.We saw many{wood pigeons}at each
 location.{Skylarks}were singing high  
 in the air and flying to nests in the 
 fields.One{lark}was having a dustbath.
{Goldfinches}were feeding on the weeds 
 and a{nightingale}was heard in the    
 wood.A dead{magpie}was hung up in the 
 wood.We think the farmer put it there 
 to scare off other magpies.We also saw
{lapwings,starlings,blackbirds,a jay , 
{chaffinch,mallard,thrush}and{kestrel.}</content>
