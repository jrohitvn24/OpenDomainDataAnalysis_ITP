 A recent survey carried out by Tyne   
 and Wear County Council estimated male
 unemployment on Town End Farm Estate  
 to be approaching 40% Other surveys   
 indicate an unwaged population of     
 about 80% of the total possible work  
 force.  As a result Sunderland's first
 Unemployed Workers Centre was         
 established on this estate. The Centre
 focuses a great deal on the           
 difficulties and injustice faced by a 
 large number of local residents with  
 regard to unemployment. Other work at 
 the Centre includes, activity         
 programmes for the unemployed, support
 for the formation of locally based    
 workers co-operatives, and womens     
 conscious raising.
