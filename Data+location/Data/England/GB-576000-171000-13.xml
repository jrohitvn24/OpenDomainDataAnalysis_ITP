		<title>13Interesting People In Hoo.</title>
		<content>  He's written three books, they have  
 all been about Hoo St. Werburgh. The  
 1st sold quite well, the 2nd sold very
 well, and the 3rd didn't sell as well.
 He is now thinking of writing about   
 the patron Saint of Hoo,{St.Werburgh. 
 Being well known in the area is a big 
 help to him, when writing his books.  
 All of his books have been written    
 since he retired as Deputy Headmaster 
 of the Hundred of Hoo. Due to his job 
{Mr.Worsdale}had limited time to read  
 books, so has not a favourite writer  
 or book. He has discovered a lot more 
 about Hoo than he ever thought        
 possible in his writing and research. 
 His 3 books are called{'History of Hoo
{From 1895 to 1985','The Parish of Hoo 
{St.Werburgh'and'A Picture Reference of
{Hoo'
