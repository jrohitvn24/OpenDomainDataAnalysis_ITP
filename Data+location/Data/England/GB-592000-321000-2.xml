		<title>02Brisley Shop Closes</title>
		<content>  The{shop}sold frozen foods,groceries,
 cereals and cleaning things. They also
 sold sweets to many children.It was   
 also a{Post Office.}                  
  The people who owned the shop had    
 other jobs as well.                   
  The shop was closed, and auctioned on
 the 29 March 85 but was not sold.     
  When the shop was closed down many   
 people were sorry to see it close,but 
 people needed a post office.There     
 were rumours that a new post office   
 was to be opened but this has not     
 happened yet, although work has       
 started on converting another         
 building to be a Post Office.         
  The space where the Post Office      
 will be is small. Cars won't be able  
 to park anywhere near because there   
 is no space.
