		<title>17CRANHAM CHURCH</title>
		<content> Cranham Church is on the western edge 
 of the village and overlooks the      
 Painswick valley. It dates back to    
 Norman times, a Norman arch being     
 found above the entrance. It has a    
 tower decorated with a shield with a  
 pair of sheepshears on it. There are 7
 yewtrees beside the path from the lych
 gate to the main door. In this gateway
 are 2 plaques commemorating those from
 Cranham and Prinknash who fell in the 
 first world war, and those who served 
 but survived. The bell of HMS Cranham,
 aminesweeper hangs in the gateway,    
 which is the village's war memorial.  
 There are several table top tombs and 
 a vault for the Horlick's family who  
 once lived in the  village.           
 The church can seat about 80 and is   
 part of a united beneficeof 5 churches
 ministered by the Rector of           
 Brimpsfield and an assistant.         </content>
