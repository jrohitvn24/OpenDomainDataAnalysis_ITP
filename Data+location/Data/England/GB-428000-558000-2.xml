		<content>    Washington{Development Corporation 
 was set up by central government in   
 1964 for the New Town; however, work  
 did not begin until 1965.  Its        
 headquarters is at{Usworth Hall,}an   
 historic building formerly belonging  
 to the National Coal Board.           
    Its main aims were to create{jobs, 
 build industrial estates to lure{new  
{industry}into the area and raise the  
 standard of the urban{environment}e.g.
 by planting trees, building new       
 houses.  It differs from the council  
 as it is not a permanent organisation.
    The Corporation{employs}240 people 
 from clerks to manual workers and     
 operates like a miniature             
 government.  In 1986 the Corporation  
 will close down and 90 of its         
 employees will be transferred to      
 Sunderland Council.
