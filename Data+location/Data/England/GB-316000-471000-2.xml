		<title>02COCKEN TUNNEL/THE SLAG BANK</title>
		<content>{ Cocken Tunnel}passes under the Slag  
 Bank which extends for over 1km along 
 the shore of the channel between      
 Ormsgill and Walney Island. It is on  
 the{old footpath}used by the{monks of 
{Furness Abbey}when they wanted to     
 cross by boat to their lands on Walney
 Island.                               
                                       
{ The Slag Bank}was made from the waste
 from the iron ore that was used in the
{Steelworks.}The works{closed down}two 
 years ago, but{iron}is the reason why 
{Barrow started to grow 150 years ago. 
 Railway lines from Barrow were sent   
 all over the world.                   
                                       
{ The land is slowly being reclaimed,  
 because the slag is being taken away  
 to fill building land and help make   
 foundations for new roads, so the     
 tunnel may disappear one day.         </content>
