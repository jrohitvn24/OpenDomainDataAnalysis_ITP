		<content>{AN INDEPENDANT SCHOOL                 
   One of the local{Roman Catholic }   
 Convent schools has been established  
 for 31 years.Most of the pupils have a
 long way to travel.They have private  
 education because of their home       
 beliefs.{Private education}is still   
 thriving in this area.Private         
 education is{supposedly}more caring   
 and understanding than that of a state
 school.                               
   Boys are not allowed to go to any   
 convent schools after the age of 5    
 years,they have to go to an ordinary  
 first school.The Governors feel the   
 girls should give their full attention
 to their school_work rather than boys.
   There is also a{non denominational} 
 private school in the area. In Surrey 
 roughly{20% of children attend private
{schools.}This is much higher than the 
 national average.                     </content>
