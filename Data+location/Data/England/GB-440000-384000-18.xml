		<title>18SOCIAL CONCERNS- BALLIFIELD</title>
		<content>   In the Ballifield Middle School area
 the results of questionnaires to local
 residents revealed the following      
 information. Many people were         
 primarily concerned with the problem  
 of local unemployment.  Some expressed
 concern about the extremist policies  
 of the local council, accusing them of
 bad management and of demanding       
 excessively high rates.   Worries were
 also expressed about today's youth -  
 about their attitudes and unsociable  
 behaviour. Increasing vandalism was   
 mentioned along with concern about the
 lack of local facilities for          
 teenagers. Some parents expressed     
 fears about the busy local roads and  
 were particularly worried about the   
 Rotherham and Retford Road junction.  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
