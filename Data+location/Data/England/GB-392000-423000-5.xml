		<title>05Farming around Todmorden</title>
		<content>   All the farms around Todmorden are  
 pastoral and keep sheep and cattle.   
 Most farms are small and privately    
 owned,keeping a variety of animals.   
   Hardy hill sheep are grazed on the  
 moors in summer and fed on hay in the 
 winter.At the end of summer most of   
 the lambs are sold at the market.     
   The cattle are mainly stall-fed on  
 cattle cake and hay.Many farmers      
 produce milk and bottle it themselves,
 to sell to the residents of Todmorden.
   The valley sides are extremely steep
 and the soils are thin, stoney and    
 acidic.The winters are often long and 
 severe, leaving a very short growing  
 season.The annual rainfall is often as
 high as 1500mm and the summers are    
 cool and cloudy.For these reasons few 
 crops can be grown except grass, which
 is cut for silage in the spring and   
 for hay in summer.                    </content>
