		<title>04SOUTH FARM - BUILDINGS</title>
		<content> South Farm has been owned since the   
 1950s by Mr.Atkinson,whose family had 
 been renting it since the turn of the 
 century when they migrated to the area
 from the Lake District.The farm house 
 is six hundred years old,long &amp; low   
 with two-storeys.Built of red brick,  
 this has been altered and added to a  
 number of times over the centuries.   
 The working farm buildings include a  
 small herringbone milking parlour for 
 eight cows,whish is housed in an old  
 converted stone barn.Other barns are  
 used as machine sheds.There are a     
 number of new larger barns,built      
 of metal,which are used for storing   
 crops and rearing calves.Near the     
 house is an old square wooden granary,
 raised on staddle stones which is now 
 disused.Also disused is a mill,built  
 in the last century,the last,as well  
 as the highest mill on the R.Meon.    </content>
