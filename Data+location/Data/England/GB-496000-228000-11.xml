		<title>11GROUPS AND SOCIETIES</title>
		<content> In the 1980s many people belonged to  
 clubs, societies and groups devoted to
 all sorts of causes and objectives.   
                                       
 Professional Institutions served the  
 interests of people pratising in      
 fields such as medicine, the law,     
 banking, engineering or commerce.     
                                       
 Protest Groups were set up to campaign
 against a wide variety of things      
 including Nuclear Weapons, Animal     
 Rights, and plans to dump radioactive 
 waste at Elstow near Bedford.         
                                       
 Clubs and Societies for people who    
 shared a common interest, such as a   
 sport, arts or a hobby proliferated.  
 Many of these served a vital social   
 role because even in a period of      
 rapidly devloping communications,     
 loneliness was not unknown.           </content>
