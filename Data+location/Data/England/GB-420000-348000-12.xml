		<title>12COACHES FROM HOGNASTON</title>
		<content> Stationed in the village of Hognaston 
 is the small coach firm "Websters".   
 The firm dates back to the 1700s when 
 as a transport company packhorses were
 used.The present owner bought the firm
 from Websters about 13years ago.      
 The firm has 4 coaches and 1 mini-bus.
 Apart from the owner there are two    
 full time drivers, one part-time, and 
 a garage mechanic who services and    
 repairs the coaches.                  
 The coaches are kept in a garage on   
 the outskirts of the village.In the   
 garage are stored spare parts,wheels, 
 tyres and the tools needed to keep the
 buses in good running order.
