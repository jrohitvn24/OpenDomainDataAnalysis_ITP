		<content> Crossways Junior School has two       
 hundred and thirty children aged seven
 to eleven years. It was opened in 1973
 by John Craven and consists of eight  
 classrooms, a large hall, resource    
 area,kitchen and administrative rooms.
 There is also a large field and       
 adventure playground. The school is   
 well equipped with resources including
 three computers. The children are     
 divided into seven classes based on   
 age and are then taught individually, 
 in groups or as a class. The school   
 aims to provide a stimulating         
 environment in which children will be 
 eager to participate and will learn to
 organise their own work which may     
 range from Mathematics to Art, from   
 English to Science with Problem       
 Solving and Topic work.
