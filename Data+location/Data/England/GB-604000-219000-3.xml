		<content> The non-traditionalists consist of    
 itinerant working families who do not 
 create a stable base for the          
 neighbourhood in which they tend to be
 concentrated.  Finally, there are the 
 young professional families who decide
 to settle permanently in Alresford.   
 Members of this group move to         
 Alresford at the start of their family
 life and tend to live in the smaller  
 houses situated on one of the newest  
 estates.  As they get older and more  
 prosperous they tend to move to a     
 bigger house in a more pleasant and   
 established area of the village.      
  Many people move to Alresford to     
 escape the pressures and stresses of  
 urban life and work and therefore only
 a very small percentage of people     
 actually live and work within the     
 village.                              
                                       </content>
