		<content>{Budge}is a game where you can have    
 as many people as you want to play.   
 One person is "on" and the others have
 a base. They have to run to a certain 
 place and touch it without being      
 caught. Then they have to run back    
 down to their base and tell the other 
 people in the base to budge. Then it  
 is their go.                          
 In{Tiggy Free,}one person is "on" and 
 the rest stand on the wall and the one
 that's "on" counts to five and you run
 out. He tigs you, you run out to the  
 tree and the other people tig you and 
 you are free.If you are caught three  
 times you are "on".                   
 In{1,2,3 Not On}_ there is a base     
 where someone counts to 100. The rest 
 hide. When he has counted, if he sees 
 anyone, he shouts his or her name.
