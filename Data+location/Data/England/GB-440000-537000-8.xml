		<title>08COMING TO PETERLEE</title>
		<content> I came to Peterlee five years ago     
 because my Dad works for N.S.K. and he
 was told to work in the Peterlee      
 Factory.As soon as I got out of the   
 aeroplane I needed my overcoat because
 it is much cooler in England than in  
 Japan.The weather here is terrible but
 their are no dreadful storms.In Winter
 it is much cooler outside but not in  
 the house because of central heating. 
 One thing I like most about living    
 here is that there are no earthquakes.
 There are at least four a week in     
 Japan,that is why the houses are made 
 of wood and not bricks.               
        The way people dress is a bit  
 different too.Adults dress more or    
 less the same but the children wear   
 shorts everyday in Japan except the   
 older ones who wear uniforms.
