		<content>  Within this area is a small Council  
house estate comprising of 86          
semi-detached properties a short       
distance away from a gypsy camp laid   
out by City Council. This consists of  
31 fixed mobile homes/caravans. These  
gypsies are of Irish origin, mainly    
'tinkers'; not the true Romanies.      
  The rest of this area is taken up by 
light industries, showrooms and        
workshops prestigious foreign cars.    
BMW, Audi/VW, Saab, Toyota, Daihatsu,  
Mitsubishi and Hyundu may all be       
purchased and sericed here. Prices     
range from 3,979.20 - 33,260 pounds for
one of these cars. All the pupils from 
2M who assisted in this project enjoyed
a ride in the 33,260 BMW Coupe-there   
was good publicity in the Kentish      
Gazette for the firm and the BBC       
Domesday Project!
