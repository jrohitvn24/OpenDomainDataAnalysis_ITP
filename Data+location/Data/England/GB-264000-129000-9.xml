		<title>09A Village Housewife</title>
		<content> Mrs. Gatehouse has lived in West      
 Buckland for seventeen years.She moved
 from a town in Essex and prefers it   
 here because of the community.She     
 finds the people here more friendly.  
 The Open University,dancing and sport 
 are her main interests,but she does   
 not have much spare time because she  
 has to look after her four children.  
 She shops in Barnstaple because of its
 wider selection of products unlike the
 village store.                        
 The North Devon link road does not    
 bother her because she feels the area 
 needs better links with the rest of   
 the country.                          
 She has no difficulty in travelling   
 because she has a large car.          
 Her husband teaches at West Buckland  
 School and she has two children there.
