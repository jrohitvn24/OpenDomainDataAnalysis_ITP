		<content> We spoke to some old ladies who told  
us about their lives.We spoke to one of
them and told her about our lives.They 
were very pleased to see that people   
were taking an interest in them.We     
asked them about their families,they   
all seemed to have large families with 
at least 5 children,the most being 11  
children.It seemed that most of their  
brothers and sisters were dead or      
lived far away.But nearly all of them  
had sons or daughters of their own     
who often came to visit them.Half way  
through our interview a lady called    
Miss Penperdeton came in to visit the  
old ladies and to show them her cards  
for her 100th birthday which will be on
the 19th of July.Most of them enjoyed  
the TV but they only listened to us.
