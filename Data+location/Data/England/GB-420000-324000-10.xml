		<content>While we were touring around the area  
we noticed that some farmers had been  
laying hedges.This is mostly done to   
Hawthorn and is a skill which is       
mainly caried out by older farmers and 
workers.First the hedge is cut and then
narrow posts are knocked into the      
ground about 2m. apart.Next the main   
branches are chopped almost through and
woven in and out of the posts.At the   
same time as this is done the farmer   
clears the ditches which is why this   
process is known as 'Hedging and       
Ditching'.The finished hedge should not
need redoing for about 20 years        
providing it is trimmed.It is more     
secure and looks more attractive than  
fences or barbed wire.The hedge gives  
protection to birds and wildlife.      
Keeping the ditches clear helps to     
prevent pollution.
