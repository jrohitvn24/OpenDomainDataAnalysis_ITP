		<title>06Brackley Market Survey</title>
		<content>   We conducted a survey among Brackley
stall holders and found out that most  
of them go to other markets also, such 
as Banbury, Oxford and Dunstable etc.  
Stall holders have   on average been   
coming to Brackley for 4 years.        
     It sells a wide variety of goods  
such as cheese, clothes, meat, double  
glazing, fish, china, sweets, fruit,   
pet food and vegetables. Stallholders  
buy their stocks from many different   
wholesalers from as far apart as London
and Stoke-on-Trent. Some of the unsold 
stock is kept in garages and store     
rooms and some in large vans so that   
storage and transport are combined.    
   Goods sold vary with the time of    
year. Fabric, clothes and fruit sell   
well in summer, and in winter sweets,  
tights and double glazing. Most stall  
holders found theft a problem, with    
something being stolen every week.     </content>
