{Food stores and Grocceries.}          
 Groceries are fairly easily obtainable
 in the area,especially in St.Mawes    
 but, in the Portscatho area there are 
 no bakeries where fresh bread can be  
 obtained.People in this part of the   
 block rely on the services of a mobile
 grocery van who visits the area daily 
 supplying local needs.                
{Gift Shops.                           
 Although the area relies very much on 
 the tourist trade,the area has not    
 been taken over by gift shops,souvenir
 shops and craft centres.These types of
 shops number very small and it may be 
 that the lack of this type of shop is 
 an added attraction to the are        
 leaving it largely unspoilt.
