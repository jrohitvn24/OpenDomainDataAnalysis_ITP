		<title>06POPULATION, CHITTERNE AREA</title>
		<content> The population of this area has slowly
 declined.  In the early nineteenth    
 century, including all the outlying   
 farms and cottages, the total         
 population of Chitterne was about 800,
 and has now declined to about 200 in  
 the complete village.   There is no   
 trace of any of the outlying          
 habitation, except for clumps of trees
 which were planted to provide shelter 
 for the dwellings.  The buildings have
 mostly been erased by the army who now
 use the area as firing ranges.        
 All the inhabitants of the area are   
 white people, many families are       
 related by marriage, and a number of  
 the adult population was born in the  
 village.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
