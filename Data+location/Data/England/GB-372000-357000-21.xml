<title>21Ensor Brickworks (Cheshire Concrete)</title>
<content>

The brickworks was demolished and the land used to build houses. The waste tip to the south of the canal was cleared and made into a football pitch and casual recreation area.&lt;br />&lt;br />We were pleased to be relieved of the noise and the dust but the field adjacent to the works was also built upon. This field was wild grassland with butterflies, grasshoppers and frogs.&lt;br />&lt;br />The football pitch is also used by irresponsible dog-owners.   &lt;br />
