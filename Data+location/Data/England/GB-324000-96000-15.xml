		<title>15SHUTE HOUSE AND SHUTE BARTON</title>
		<content> The earliest building on the site     
 dating from about 1380 was built by   
 Sir William Bonville who was Sheriff  
 of Devon in 1390 and he died in 1408. 
  The rooms of chief interest are the  
 great kitchen on the ground floor with
 its enormous fire place. In 1829 this 
 housed a specially built spit for     
 roasting 2 oxen on the occasion of    
 John Poles 21st birthday.It was said  
 that thousands of estate workers and  
 villagers from miles around were      
 entertained at the party.             
 The approach drive to Shute Barton is 
 through the Tudor Gate house.         
  Shute house used to be a girls school
 but now it is made into flats.   It is
 a large,white house and can be seen   
 from miles around,especially from the 
 south side of our area.
