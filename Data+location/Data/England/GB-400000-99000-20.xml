		<title>20LIVING IN COLEHILL.</title>
		<content> I like living in Colehill because     
 there are lots of play areas like     
 Olivers Park. There is a little wood  
 that we play in and lots of swings and
 a slide. There is Cannon Hill woods   
 quite near where we live. Near the    
 by-pass is a river. We go down there  
 for a walk sometimes. We go to school 
 at Hayeswood. It has one big play-    
 ground and a big field. Colehill is a 
 nice place for horse riding. Very near
 is Wimborne Minster. Lots of people go
 there. There are lots of fields around
 us that we play in and lots of friends
 live near. People keep many pets      
 because the roads are not main roads. 
 In Colehill, people have quite big    
 gardens and nice houses.
