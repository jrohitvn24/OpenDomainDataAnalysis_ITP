		<title>16Seaton Church</title>
		<content> The church in Seaton is called All    
 Hallows' Church.The church was built  
 around the 11th or 12th century. It   
 was restored by two sisters called    
 Monkton about 50 years ago.           
 The rector is Rev.A.J.Gough.He lives  
 in Lyddington,two miles away.He       
 doesn't live in Seaton because he is  
 also the vicar of Lyddington.         
 It has a big stained glass window     
 depicting the Resurrection and also a 
 memorial window.By the seats there are
 little kneelers(made by the women of  
 the village),dedicated to past vicars 
 and rectors.                          
 When you go into the porch of the     
 church there is a very valuable chest.
 The altar is made of marble.On it     
 stand a cross and two candlesticks and
 there is a coloured altar-frontal.At  
 the side of the altar is a chair      
 called the Bishop's Chair.            </content>
