 belonging to Mr Sexton. This includes 
 Rumley Wood, Old Hall(which is        
 supposed to have conections with the  
 super natural) a moat and ponds. The  
 moat used to surround Old Hall but    
 doesn't any longer.                   
   Old Hall is a two storey building.  
 It has sixteenth century chimney      
 stacks with two octaganal shafts.     
   Mr Sexton breeds pheasants which lay
 between 10 and 12 eggs. In earlier    
 days, the eggs were almost an         
 industry.                             
   In the middle of the pond there is  
 an island where the birds.            
   Rumley Wood ,situated nearby, is a  
 large wood which is full of wildlife  
 and nesting birds. There are a couple 
 of guard dogs, both of them are       
 Alsations.
