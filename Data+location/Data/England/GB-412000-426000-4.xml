		<title>04FREE TIME - WYKE'S 9 YR.OLDS</title>
		<content> The children of High Fernley School,  
 Wyke, wrote the following on how they 
 spend their free time:-               
   Most of us watch television every   
 night.  Many of us have televisions in
 our bedrooms, and when we want to get 
 away from everybody we go and watch   
 our own.  At weekends, some of our    
 families hire videos and we usually   
 watch them in the mornings.           
   Nearly all of us belong to some sort
 of club after school. We go to cubs,  
 brownies, gymnastics, swimming and    
 karate.  A lot of the boys train and  
 play football with Wyke Wanderers.    
 Some people are learning to play      
 musical instruments.                  
   The rest of the time we play around 
 on the streets on our bikes, or play  
 football or cricket.  The park is too 
 far away and isn't nice anyway.
