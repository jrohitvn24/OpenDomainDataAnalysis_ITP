		<title>15NEW PONDS IN KNIVETON</title>
		<content> Once there was a pond down Washpool   
 Lane in Kniveton where farmers came to
 wash their sheep.As the pond became   
 disused, because farmers started to   
 dip their sheep,it began to fill up   
 with silt and became a wild patch of  
 marshy ground.                        
 In 1983 two people from the village   
 decided to dig the old pond out to try
 and make Washpool Lane a more         
 attractive place for people to enjoy. 
 They used a J.C.B. digger to dig out  
 the pond to its old hard bed.They have
 Surrounded the pond with a wall of    
 stone which they found in the area.   
 It is intended that the pond should   
 have some fish in for the people to   
 watch.                                
 Besides the main pond they also dug   
 out a smaller natural pond.This is    
 already full of many interesting      
 creatures.                            </content>
