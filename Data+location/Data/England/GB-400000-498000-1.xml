		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO REETH GRID</title>
		<content> Our grid incorporates the villages of 
 Reeth and Healaugh and the surrounding
 area comprising moor,pasture and      
 river.It is in a National Park and    
 Tourism in 1986 is as major a source  
 of employment as hill farming.        
    In our survey we have tried to     
 highlight those aspects of life in the
 grid which we ,(the children and      
 teacher)thought reflected what it was 
 like to live in the area in 1985/86.We
 have covered areas including Local    
 services,Leisure, Tourism,Farming     
 ,Care,Ecology and Transport.The area  
 is very rural,with about half the     
 grid Population working within 2 miles
 of their home.The results of a random 
 sample within the grid showed that    
 everybody had a radio and television, 
 and about a quarter had videos and    
 computer.
