<title>32LIFE STYLES IN THE COUNTRY</title>
<content>

In many families both parents work either locally or commute to larger cities. Many do not have families living close by and, therefore, child care is quite a big issue.  Traditional country pursuits, whilst still popular with some, do not feature in the life of many in the village. There is a local hunt and clay pigeon shooting in the area. Horse riding is very popular and quite a few own their own horses. Rough shooting and especially fishing are popular.  There is a thriving allotment community in the village and there is always a waiting list for vacant plots.  There are musical events in the village and around the area which are quite well attended.   &lt;br />
