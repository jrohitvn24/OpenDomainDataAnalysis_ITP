		<title>16ROMSEY'S WET FISH SHOP</title>
		<content> On Friday 7th June 1985 Romsey's only 
 wet fish shop closed after 22 years.  
 We thought it was a great shame!  It  
 closed because the lease ran out and  
 the new rent was too high.  Mr Whale  
 told us about his many happy years    
 working there.  In 1963 he found      
 Romsey to be a quiet and friendly     
 little market town.  Then, there was  
 no Waitrose or bus station.  The buses
 stopped in the Market Square and there
 was a two way traffic system.  There  
 was a market down Bell Street which   
 sold rabbits, pheasants, poultry and  
 vegetables.  Among his many regular   
 customers were two who both came every
 day (except Sundays) for 22 years.    
 Fresh cod, herrings and smoked haddock
 were most popular, but also salmon    
 when in season.  Mr Whale hopes to get
 another job in the fish trade soon.
