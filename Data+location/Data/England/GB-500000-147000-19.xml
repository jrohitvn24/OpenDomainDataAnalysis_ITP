		<content> The{Gunpowder Works}were used from the
 17th to the 20th century. An explosion
 in 1901 partially destroyed the       
 buildings, killing six people and     
 shattering the windows of Chilworth   
 Manor half a mile away. The gunpowder 
 was used in the Civil and First World 
 Wars. The{Railway Station}is 150      
 years old and the railway line        
 transported soldiers, ammunition and  
 aircraft fuel during the First World  
 War.                                  
                                       
{Chilworth Manor}was a monastery in the
 11th century and was recorded in the  
 original Domesday Book. It has an     
 interesting three-tiered garden.      
{Postford House}was used in the Great  
 War as a hospital and was visited     
 frequently by Queen Mary. John Evelyn 
 lived there and designed the rose     
 garden.                               </content>
