		<title>02A DAY ON MY FARM</title>
		<content>   A good day on my farm would be to   
 get up at half past 6  in the         
 morning get dressed and go down       
 stairs.I have breakfast and a cup of  
 tea. Then I would go out and help my  
 Dad milk the cows. When he has        
 finished milking I help my Dad to take
 the cows out, come back and wait for  
 Dad to have his breakfast. We go down 
 and look at the sheep and then go and 
 shift the electric fence for the      
 cows. Then we get the milking gear    
 ready for the evening. By then it     
 would be dinner time. After a dinner  
 of sandwiches and wafers, I would go  
 outside and ask my Dad if he would get
 my pony Ned in for me. My Dad gets my 
 pony in and we go out riding. Then Dad
 and I go and get the cows. I ride Ned 
 and my Dad has to walk.               
                                       
                                       </content>
