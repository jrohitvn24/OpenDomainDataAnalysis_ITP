		<title>15ELECTRICITY GRID STATION</title>
		<content> This has long been a point of interest
 along Milords road between Fraddon and
 Scarcewater,an industrial looking     
 complex set in rural Cornwall.It has  
 been of interest to more than those   
 who casually pass by.The grid station 
 has controlled the supply of          
 electricty to all who live and work in
 West and mid_Cornwall.During the war  
 it was singled out for a bomb attack  
 by the German bombers but they        
 narrowly missed their target.It is a  
 complex of transformers lowering the  
 voltage from the main grid supply     
 which is identified by the numerous   
 steel pylons which converge on the    
 station.                              
      Now the station is automatically 
 controlled.Progress and increased     
 electricity demands have resulted in a
 more modern station being built during
 the 1960's on the edge of Goss Moor.  </content>
