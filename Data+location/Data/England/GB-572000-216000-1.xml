		<content> The land rises as you enter the area  
 from Chelmsford but then it is mainly 
 flat.It is an agricultural place with 
 lots of farms.The fields have crops in
 them,sometimes cows &amp; horses.There are
 woods,one of them has been turned into
 a nature reserve.                     
 The area has a post office,three      
 garages,a chapel,four pubs one of     
 which is said to be haunted ,a        
 butcher, a farm shop,a take-away cafe.
 At the village hall various activities
 take place &amp; the playing field        
 alongside is used for football &amp;      
 cricket as well as a children's play  
 area.During the middle of June the    
 main road from Chelmsford to Braintree
 is blocked with traffic going to the  
 Essex Show Ground.The old houses are  
 dotted about the village with two new 
 Estates and a council Estate grouped  
 together.                             </content>
