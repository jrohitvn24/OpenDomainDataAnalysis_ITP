		<title>12Watton Priory</title>
		<content> After the surrender of the monastery, 
 the Prior's lodging was retained as a 
 mansion and the other buildings were  
 dismantled and eventually demolished. 
 The area of the nunnery is still known
 as "The Nuns", and the surrounding    
 farmland belongs to Watton Abbey Farm,
 belonging to Mr. A. Pexton.           
 Traditions surround the Priory site.  
 One story maintains there is a        
 subterranean passage between the      
 convent and a holy well at Kilnwick   
 called "The Lady's Well". The nuns are
 said to have performed wonderful cures
 by means of this water.               
 A woman and child, hiding in a Priory 
 room during the Civil War, are said to
 have been murdered there by soldiers  
 who entered by a secret door. The     
 headless woman, carrying her child,   
 is supposed to haunt the Priory.      
 So,too, is the figure of a tall monk. </content>
