		<title>11Bayford Footpath Walk 1.</title>
		<content>  This footpath was walked in mid June 
 and is 2.5 km long.                   
  It starts at the{Bakers Arms,}you    
 cross to a well surfaced track by a   
 farm, and then cross a stile on your  
 right.The path goes for about 100m on 
 good firm ground to next stile.You    
 continue by a fence to a copse,and    
 third stile.                          
  After another 400m, the path gets    
 slippery,{boots are advised}in bad    
 weather.100m on the path is overgrown 
 and poorly marked.You cross a wooden  
 bridge on your right , and it is again
 very overgrown .Then you head uphill  
 into a muddy wood, after about 100m   
 you walk downhill to a second bridge. 
  The path continues by the{railway    
{line}for about 300m to another bridge.
 Across it you turn left and continue  
 along a track for 700m until you get  
 to B'don Lane and then into Hertford. </content>
