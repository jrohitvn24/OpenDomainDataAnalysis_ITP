		<content>      {AN INTERVIEW WITH MISS WILLIAMS.
  ON TUESDAY 9TH JULY MISS WILLIAMS    
 CAME INTO WOODLAND SCHOOL AND TOLD US 
 ABOUT FLITWICK AS IT WAS.FLITWICK USED
 TO BE A VERY QUIET PLACE.IT WAS NEARLY
 ALL FIELDS AND FARMS.                 
  ON AMPTHILL ROAD IN 1910 THERE WERE  
 ONLY TWO HOUSES,BUT OVER THE NEXT     
 TWENTY YEARS MANY MORE WERE BUILT.    
 AFTER EACH WORLD WAR A LARGE COUNCIL  
 ESTATE WAS BUILT IN FLITWICK. THEN IN 
 1973 A NEW,LARGE,PRIVATE ESTATE WAS   
 BEGUN ON THE WEST EDGE OF THE VILLAGE.
  MISS WILLIAMS WENT TO SCHOOL AT      
 FLITWICK SCHOOL,DUNSTABLE ROAD,WHICH  
 LATER BECAME FLITWICK LOWER SCHOOL AND
 MORE RECENTLY BECAME FLITWICK YOUTH   
 CLUB.BEHIND FLITWICK SCHOOL WAS A     
 POND,BUT NOW IT IS FILLED IN AND IT IS
 AN OPEN SPACE.IN THE PAST THIS AREA   
 FLOODED FRQUENTLY AND THIS WAS KNOWN  
 AS 'THE POND'S REVENGE ON THE COUNCIL'</content>
