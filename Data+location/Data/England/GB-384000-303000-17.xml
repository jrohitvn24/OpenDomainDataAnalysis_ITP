		<content>Codsall Christian Aid Group is a small 
support group. We are closely involved 
with Christian Aid Week each year. Last
year we collected over 200 blankets to 
send to refugees in Eritrea; we also   
work to promote development education, 
chiefly by arranging events in "One    
World Week" each October.              
Codsall Women's Institute was formed in
1920 when Codsall was truly a village. 
The aim of the movement is to improve  
the quality of rural life by the fuller
education of the country woman. Member-
ship has fluctuated from 42-90 and is  
now around 30. We have classes or talks
or demonstrations on craft work,cookery
good health, women in society and      
present day problems. We raise money   
for overseas projects. At home we      
support many local charities.
