		<title>08A DAY AT ENGAINES SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Friday is my favourite day at School. 
 Its the day we go swimming.But first  
 we have an Assembly for the School.   
 We leave at 9.30 &amp; travel by coach to 
 Clacton Pool.We do different strokes  
 each week &amp; sometimes we try for our  
 Grade I.When we come back,our teacher 
 takes us for English topics. After    
 dinner the boys usually play football 
 but the girls play French Skipping.Its
 played with a piece of elastic four   
 metres long,tied together then put    
 round two people's ankles.Girls take  
 turns jumping it, inside the elastic, 
 then outside.Finally you jump onto the
 elastic with both feet.Once all the   
 people have jumped it, the elastic is 
 raised higher &amp; higher.In the after_  
 noon we do maths. Sometimes we have   
 the vicar for a while afterwards. 3   
 p.m. is our hometime, but after School
 we have rounders &amp; athletics clubs.   </content>
