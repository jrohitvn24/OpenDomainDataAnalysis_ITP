 In Grove there is a Footabll Club     
 called Grove Challengers. It was      
 founded in 1971 and now has 100       
 members aged 9 - 15, with 6 teams. The
 Under 15's won the League Match and   
 Cup for 1984-85. There is a Player of 
 the Year award for each team, every   
 year. The team colours are black and  
 white. The big event is the six a side
 match, when 30 teams from Bath to     
 Oxford come. Six teams from N. Ireland
 also take part. For the last 6 years, 
 this event has given those boys a four
 day break from their trouble torn     
 country. A fairly new venture started 
 is the BMX track in front of the      
 Recreation Ground. Rugby and cricket  
 are also played in W. Grove. A golf   
 course is planned and an Athletics    
 Stadium is also being considered.
