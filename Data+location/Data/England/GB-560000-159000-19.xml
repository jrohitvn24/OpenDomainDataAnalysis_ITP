		<content> Faiseat held their annual tennis      
 tournament on Saturday,July 27th.This 
 event has been taking place for the   
 last twenty five years.Recently,it has
 grown in importance and now some two  
 hundred competitors take part each    
 year.These competitors play by        
 invitation only.With such a large     
 number taking part it is now          
 impossible to play all the matches in 
 Fairseat.The early rounds are played  
 at a number of locations.In fact there
 are now eighteen centres in all.Most  
 of these are tennis courts that are   
 attached to private houses in the     
 area.There are centres at Ightam,The  
 McMillan Centre,Fairseat House,Wrotham
 Rec,Trottiscliffe and elsewhere.The   
 main centre is at Court House in      
 Fairseat.This is where all the        
 important matches are played and      
 prizes presented.                     </content>
