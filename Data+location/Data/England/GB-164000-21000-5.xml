		<title>05ATTITUDES OF PEOPLE IN CURY</title>
		<content>    The people in the area did not     
 want too much change. It appeared that
 what was going on in the rest of the  
 world did not really affect them,     
 though they were naturally concerned  
 about tragic events. They were quite  
 happy with their own way of life and  
 felt that they were out of the 'rat   
 race'. They wanted life as it is and  
 has been for many years to continue in
 the same way. They were not too       
 concerned about the lack of amenities 
 in the area as this went with their   
 quiet way of life, though some people 
 would like some more shops. One person
 summed the general attitude when he   
 stated that 'He didn't want the world 
 to discover Gunwalloe'. Meaning he    
 wanted it to remain a quiet rural and 
 pleasant area.
