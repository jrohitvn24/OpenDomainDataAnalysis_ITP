		<content> Coventry was heavily bombed during    
{World War}2.The car factories were    
 turned over to the making of          
 aeroplanes and ammunition.Coventry was
 a prime target for the German         
 bombers.In May 1985 we celebrated the 
 40th anniversary of{Victory in Europe.
 In Ashington Grove,Whitley,one lady   
 who still lives there,recalled how all
 the residents saved something from    
 their rations for a street party.Their
 joy was mixed with sadness.In one air 
 raid alone 8 people in our Grove were 
 killed.Despite the hardship,the lady  
 felt that nothing compared with the   
 community spirit of wartime.          
 During 1985 Coventry has been         
 celebrating the{100th anniversary of  
{the motor car}with displays and       
 parades.Only{Talbot Cars}carry on the 
 great tradition of car making in this 
 area.                                 </content>
