		<title>18E.Horsley S. Homes for aged</title>
		<content> There are 2 old peoples' homes in the 
 area. Guildford Borough Council pro-  
 vide 26 single self-contained units,6 
 double &amp; 1 guest, with communal laun- 
 dry, library &amp; a Warden in case of    
 need.  A mobile shop calls weekly.    
 Nearby Limegrove is a Surrey County   
 Council home for elderly unable to    
 live alone with single rooms on 3     
 floors for 48 residents (average age  
 90) having their own furnishings;  9  
 lounges with TV &amp; communal diningroom.
 Every endeavour is made to keep the   
 residents until they die, but there is
 a shortage of local part-time staff &amp; 
 sometimes in spite of devoted care by 
 all staff, sick residents have to be  
 transferred to a geriatric hospital.  
 Non-residents can spend the day at the
 home.  Extra amenities i.e. minibus   
 for outings, small musical organ, all 
 supplied by "Friends of Limegrove".   </content>
