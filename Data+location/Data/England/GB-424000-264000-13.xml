		<title>13EDWARD VII CHEST HOSPITAL.</title>
		<content> A memorial to the  king it was        
 built high on Hartford Hill over-     
 looking Warwick in 1923 as a          
 sanatorium for tuberculosis patients. 
 Any surgery was carried out in        
 Warwick.Later a small theatre was     
 built on site.Surgery for T.B. became 
 less common but other ailments were   
 treated especially cancer.In the 60's 
 a heart unit was started.A machine    
 made by Melrose was used to pump      
 blood.Heart surgery patients were     
 given a rosebud as they went into the 
 theatre and it was put by their locker
 so that it was the first thing they   
 saw when they came round.Hence the    
 nickname'the Hospital of the Rose'.At 
 one time there were about l75 beds.As 
 other hospitals opened in Warwickshire
 the number of patients fell and in    
 l983 it became a geriatric hospital   
 with 56 beds.Beautiful view from front</content>
