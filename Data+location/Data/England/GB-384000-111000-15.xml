 RETIRED PEOPLE WHO HAVE MOVED HERE    
 FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY WITHIN
 THE LAST 10 YEARS.                    
  MOST OF THE WORKING POPULATION GO OUT
 OF THE VILLAGE TO WORK IN BLANDFORD OR
 SHAFTESBURY, POOLE, SALISBURY OR EVEN 
 LONDON. THE OVERALL IMPRESSION IS OF A
 VARIETY OF OCCUPATIONS AS THERE IS NO 
 DOMINANT INDUSTRY OR COMMERCIAL       
 UNDERTAKING IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WHICH
 WOULD PROVIDE EMPLOYMENT FOR LARGE    
 NUMBERS. THERE ARE SOME ARMY AND NAVAL
 OFFICERS WHO ARE AWAY A GREAT DEAL    
 LEAVING THEIR WIVES AND FAMILIES HERE.
 THERE ARE TEACHERS FROM LOCAL STATE   
 AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS, AN ARCHITECT, A  
 DESIGNER, AN ESTATE AGENT,SEVERAL SHOP
 ASSISTANTS AND WAITRESSES AND A NUMBER
 OF LORRY DRIVERS. THERE IS ALSO A     
 STONEMASON AND THERE ARE SEVERAL
