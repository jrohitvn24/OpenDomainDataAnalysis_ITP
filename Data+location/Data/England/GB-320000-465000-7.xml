		<title>07FARMING-RAMPSIDE HALL</title>
		<content> Rampside Hall started in a colourful  
 and cheerful history as a lady said   
 to her fiance I will marry you if you 
 have a house made which is different  
 from any other house in the world. The
 fiance built a house with twelve      
 chimmneys and a fireplace for each    
 one.Then disaster struck. About four  
 years ago an anonymous person said he 
 was going to buy Rampside Hall and    
 repair it, but he never did, so the   
 hall lapsed into even more ruin.As a  
 result of the anonymous person,no     
 one stood a chance of bidding for the 
 hall.                                 
                                       
                                       
         {BOW-WINDOWS-FARM}            
 Bow-windows-farm is dated from        
 1604.The farm is roughly 50 acres.
