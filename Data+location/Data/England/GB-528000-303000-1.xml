		<title>01The village of Thorney</title>
		<content>   {Thorney}is a small village 9 miles 
 east of{Peterborough.}Thorney was     
 originally an island called{The Isle  
{of Thorns.}The{Abbey}in Thorney dates 
 back{900}years. The{A47}runs through  
 Thorney from Peterborough to Norwich  
 which makes it noisy and dangerous    
 especially in summer. Our village is  
 surrounded by the fens ,which is ideal
 land for the many farms,whose fields  
 are separated by dykes. Thorney has a 
 combination of old and new houses. Our
 village provides much of its own      
 entertainment, catering for all ages  
 from{5}to{80.}                        
    We have a primary school in Thorney
 called the{Duke of Bedford School.    
 We have a variety of shops including  
 a{post office.}There are two{police   
{houses}and one{fire station.}We also  
 have our own{bus company.}We have a   
{blacksmith}and a{saddler.}            </content>
