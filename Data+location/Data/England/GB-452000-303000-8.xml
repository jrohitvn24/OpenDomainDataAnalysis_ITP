		<content> This block is mostly residential with 
 a few shops and some open land.The    
 roads are wide but they need          
 resurfacing because they were built   
 when the houses were built and are    
 concrete slabs laid down for the      
 road.New tarmac surfaces have been    
 laid on the main roads this year and  
 they are much better.All of the roads 
 were named about the time that Canada 
 was given its own Institution and so  
 have names like "Dominion Road"       
 ,"Treaty Road" and "liberty Road".    
 Most of the people who live here can  
 get to a food shop or hot-food        
 takeaway shop by walking .The bus     
 service has four buses into the City  
 so it is quite easy to get about.
