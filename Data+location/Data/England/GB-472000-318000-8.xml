 There are a number of primary and     
 secondary schools in the town,        
 together with the College of Further  
 Education.                            
                                       
 In the last few years there have      
 been several new schools built to     
 accomodate Melton Mowbray's rising    
 population.                           
                                       
 In 1964 all Melton Mowbray's schools  
 became comprehensive. This introduced 
 a two tier system of secondary        
 education:high schools for 11 to 14   
 year olds and an upper school for 14  
 to 16/18 year olds.
