		<title>09Old Whittington Housing</title>
		<content>  Old Whittington is largely made up of
 a big Council Estate built between    
 1957 and 1959. When it was built there
 were 920 dwellings. The majority of   
 the houses are semi-detached with a   
 pebble-dashed exterior. There are both
 two and three bedroom types. Also     
 built on the estate are four blocks of
 small flats mainly occupied by older  
 couples and single aged people. Over  
 the past few years 140 of the houses  
 have been sold to their sitting       
 tenants.                              
  Ninety-one percent of people         
 questioned said they liked living in  
 Old Whittington. Good community spirit
 and good shopping facilities were     
 given as reasons by forty percent of  
 those people asked whilst sixty-seven 
 percent gave their main reason as     
 being well served by the local bus    
 service.                              </content>
