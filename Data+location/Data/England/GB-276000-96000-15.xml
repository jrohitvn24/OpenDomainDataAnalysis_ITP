		<content> This morning we went on a trip to West
 Studham, last time we had to go in two
 bus loads but we did not have to this 
 time because eight were ill. Most of  
 them had chickenpox, including Sara   
 who lives at West Studham. A          
 naturalist showed us around.He took   
 us to the wood.The farmer who owns the
 land, has 75 acres, 13 wood, 9 rough  
 pasture, 5 orchard (mixed), 48        
 permanent _ 11 hay, 240 sheep _ 120   
 ewes, 3 rams and 117 lambs, slowly    
 going. Did you know that the most     
 important thing in the whole world is 
 the green leaf because a leaf gives   
 off oxygen and brings in carbon       
 dioxide which we must not breathe     
 in? We saw many different kinds of    
 trees in the wood and a great many    
 varieties of plants. We saw some      
 orchids. It is a good area for        
 butterflies but the sun wasn't out.   </content>
