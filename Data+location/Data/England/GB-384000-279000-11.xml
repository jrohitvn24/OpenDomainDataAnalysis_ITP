     The village is an interesting mix 
 of people. It was originally a small  
 farming community which was           
 superceeded by the industrial         
 development of the {iron works}.Many  
 of the oldest families in the village 
 derive from workers brought in to     
 service this industry. As the steel   
 works and the canal declined in       
 importance, carpet weavers from       
 kidderminster settled and commuted to 
 work.                                 
   Lately there has been some          
 settlement of people who use the      
 village as a dormitory, commuting to  
 work in the West Midland connurbation.
   It is interesting that each         
 succeeding type are regarded as       
 'foreigners' by the residents, often  
 for many years.
