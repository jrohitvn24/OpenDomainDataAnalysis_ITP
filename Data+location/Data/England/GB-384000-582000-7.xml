		<title>07OLD RAILWAY</title>
		<content>  The old railway line opened in 1856. 
 It was planned to help with transport 
 for coal and iron but it was too      
 late,as the iron works had closed in  
 1846.The line was extended in 1862 to 
 join the Carlisle to Hawick line so   
 people could travel into Scotland.    
  The line closed in 1956 to the       
 disappointment of the people who now  
 rely on road transport only.Now the   
 old track can be seen creeping across 
 the landscape, sometimes reclaimed by 
 farmers for grazing and in other      
 places left to grow wild.             
  Older local people miss the old      
 railway.It went past a row of         
 houses.On show day they used to wave  
 to the passengers as they arrived in  
 hundreds from the towns.              
  There were four trains a day taking  
 people on outings to Newcastle and    
 Edinburgh or to school in Hexham.     </content>
