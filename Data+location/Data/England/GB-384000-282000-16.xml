		<title>16Kinver - Best Kept Village</title>
		<content>     Every year in Staffordshire there 
is a Best Kept Village Competition.    
It is divided into sections according  
to the size of the village. This year  
(1985) Kinver has won the prize as the 
Best Kept Village in its section.      
     Everyone has to do their part     
keeping their gardens tidy and         
remembering not to drop litter.        
     The schools have a poster         
competition on the theme Â£Keep Kinver  
Tidy'. The posters are displayed in    
the schools and around the village.    
After the Best Kept Village competition
is over the posters are displayed in   
the library, judged and prizes awarded.
