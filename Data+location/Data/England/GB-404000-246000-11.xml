		<title>11Timber Framed Cottages.</title>
		<content> In Harvington in the old part of the  
 village there are lots of black and   
 white timber framed houses.We visited 
 one called Firbank. In nineteen forty 
 eight it was modernised.There is a    
 main house and a stable which is now  
 a kitchen.The main building was built 
 four hundred years ago. It used to be 
 called Ingram's Place,and some people 
 think it may have been an inn called  
 The White Hart. There are several     
 other thatched cottages nearby.       
 We interviewed Timothy Davis,a boy at 
 our school,who lives in a thatched    
 cottage.His home is five hundred      
 years old.It has not been rethatched  
 for many years. It is cool in the     
 summer and warm in the winter.It has  
 wire over the thatch to protect it    
 from the birds.There are hooks in the 
 loft to keep the roof on. There is    
 also a large bread oven.              </content>
