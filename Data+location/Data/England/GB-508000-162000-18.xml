		<title>18Hersham Shopping Centre</title>
		<content> One of the most recent changes in the 
 area is the building of the shopping  
 centre in Hersham, on the site of the 
 old abbattoir. The centre is quite    
 large, built around a pedestrian      
 precinct with a large car park near   
 by. The brick built buildings are made
 more attractive by the plants and     
 benches which are dotted around.      
 We interviewed several people shopping
 there and found that they all thought 
 it had been an exellent idea adding to
 the community feeling. Several people 
 had met old friends again, and most   
 found it a cheaper and more pleasant  
 place in which to shop. There is an   
 assortment of shops, the largest being
 Safeways Supermarket. But still there 
 seems to be a need for a large        
 department store, as most people still
 have to travel to Kingdton, Guilford  
 or Staines for major items .          </content>
