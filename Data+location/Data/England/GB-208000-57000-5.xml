    There is a fairly high level of    
{unemployment}in the town at present as
 far as the male population is         
 concerned.   Some of this is voluntary
 unemployment, early retirement, and   
 retirement due to ill health.   A     
 number of people from other parts of  
 the country have moved into the town  
 and have been unemployed from the     
 beginning.  It is estimated that      
 about three quarters of the female    
 population of working age have either 
 a full time or a part time occupation.
{  The Milk Factory,}engaged in the    
 collection and distribution of milk   
 and the production of milk products is
 the major employer in the town.       
    The{railway station}which at one   
 time was a major employer now employ  
 few people.
