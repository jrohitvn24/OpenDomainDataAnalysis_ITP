		<title>15St.Matthew's Church Wookey</title>
		<content>  St.Matthew's Church reflects two     
 important religious events. In 1635 an
 order was given by Archbishop Laud,   
 who was concerned to stop the spread  
 of Puritanism, to place communion     
 tables under the east wall of the     
 chancels of all the churches. Bishop  
 Pierce enforced this in his diocese,  
 and Wookey Church seems then to have  
 procured a new altar, which is still  
 used today, and to have put rails     
 before it which are now serving as    
 altar rails in the chapel and are     
 dated 1635.                           
  In 1611, King James 1st's new bible, 
 the Authorised Version, was published 
 and a copy of it is still preserved in
 the church. In 1963 a case to contain 
 it was made by the Somerset Guild of  
 Craftsmen.                            
                                       
                                       </content>
