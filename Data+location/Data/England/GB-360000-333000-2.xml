   Audley Brow is a dairy farm situated
 in 220 acres of land which is all down
 to grass.The farmer has 377 head of   
 cattle which includes young stock.The 
 farmer thinks the farm gets its name  
 from Lord Audley who was supposed to  
 have camped on the hill and fought a  
 battle there.The farmhouse is about   
 150 years old.                        
   Styche Farm is situated in 147 acres
 of land which is mostly grass but some
 corn.The farmer has cows and horses.  
 There are 3.5 acres of dried up fish  
 pond and 4 acres of woodland which is 
 called The Fox Cover.On half of the   
 boundary there is a river called The  
 Duckow.Parts of the farmhouse are 400 
 years old.                            
   Both farms were originally part of  
 the Styche Estate owned by the Clive  
 family.                               </content>
