		<content> Western area: Steeple Barton, near    
 St. Mary's Church, was a thriving     
 community from about the year 800     
 providing food for the royal court at 
 Woodstock and then for Oseney Abbey in
 Oxford. This ended about 1350 with the
 Black Death and the centre of activity
 moved to Middle Barton. For many years
 Steeple Barton did not have a resident
 vicar; or 'squire' until in the 19th  
 century the Halls, of the Swan Brewery
 in Oxford, created the Barton Abbey   
 estate. An existing house was rebuilt 
 by them and renamed Barton Abbey.     
 Middle Barton is a village between the
 hamlets of Steeple Barton and Westcote
 Barton. It developed as a Victorian   
 open village and facilities and       
 services were concentrated there.     
 Middle Barton is not a parish and for 
 most of the people the parish church  
 is St. Mary's at Steeple Barton.      </content>
