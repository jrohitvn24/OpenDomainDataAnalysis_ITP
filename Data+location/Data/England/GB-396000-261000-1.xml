		<title>01DESCRIPTION OF AREA</title>
		<content> The area is mainly farmland, but      
 includes the village of {Hanbury}which
 is situated between Bromsgrove and    
 Droitwich on the B4090.               
 The village has a population of about 
 eight hundred people. The name{Hanbury
 is derived from a Saxon word meaning  
 "High town". This is probably due to  
 the position of the church two miles  
 north west of the village centre.     
 Main buildings include the {Vernon    
{Arms}public house named after the     
 Vernon Family late owners of nearby { 
{Hanbury Hall.}The Village hall dates  
 from eighteen ninetytwo.              
 There is a small memorial garden with 
 a stone cross in the village          
 commemorating men killed in the       
 second world war.
