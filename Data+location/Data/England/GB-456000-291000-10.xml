		<title>10E.E.C. SUBSIDIES -WILLOUGHBY</title>
		<content>                                       
 The farmers of Willoughby who keep    
 dairy cows have been affected a lot by
 the E.E.C.'s Common Agricultural      
 Policy. There is a big milk surplus in
 Europe. So the E.E.C. wants to stop   
 farmers producing milk if possible. It
 does this by a variety of subsidies.  
                                       
 For example, one farmer in Willoughby,
 has a large herd of Guernsey dairy    
 cattle. However, he will be paid 8p   
 for every pint of milk he would have  
 produced if he gets rid of these. So  
 he is going to sell them, and turn to 
 beef production instead.              
                                       
 This will mean the cows no longer go  
 through the village every morning and 
 evening to be milked, removing one    
 part of the village's atmosphere.
