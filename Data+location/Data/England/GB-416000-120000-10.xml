		<content> We went to Newcourt Farm to talk to   
 Mr. Mercer.The farmhouse is over 300  
 years old and is possibly marked on a 
 map dated 1590. He manages a mixed    
 farm covering 2116 acres. 15 people   
 work on the farm including Mr.        
 Mercer.He gets up at 6.30 every       
 morning to tell the men what to do.   
 Then he visits the 3 dairies, has     
 breakfast, goes to check the crops and
 then onto his office at Langford      
 Castle to do the paperwork. He checks 
 the cattle during the day. He has been
 living in Downton for 18 years. He    
 said he liked the satisfaction of     
 being responsible for all that he     
 could see. On the farm he grows wheat,
 barley and grass. On the east side of 
 the main road, the A 338, the ground  
 is river gravel. On the west side it  
 is chalk. He keeps sheep and cows. He 
 has 364 cows and likes them the best. </content>
