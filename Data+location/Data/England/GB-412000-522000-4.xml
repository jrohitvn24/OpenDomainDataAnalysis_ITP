		<title>04Buckhead 1984/5 N.U.M.Strike</title>
		<content> The miners strike 1984/5 affected the 
 Buckhead Opencast Site.It was         
 originally intended that all coal     
 produced on the site would be taken to
 the N.C.B. Disposal Plant at Swalwell 
 on Tyneside to be sorted and crushed  
 to a maximum size of 2" before  being 
 transported to the power stations.The 
 strike stopped the transporting of the
 coal from the site, but did not affect
 the actual mining.Thus large stock    
 piles of coal formed.This caused two  
 great problems i.e.danger of          
 combustion and possibility of         
 pollution.The untreated, stacked coal 
 gave off an acidic/iron orange liquid 
 which had to be drained into deep     
 lagoons and neutralised by lime to    
 avoid the pollution of nearby streams.
 The piles had to be compressed to keep
 out hot air to minimise the risk of   
 combustion.(continued)                </content>
