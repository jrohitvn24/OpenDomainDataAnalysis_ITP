		<content>{Swainby Sheep Sales,}started by local 
 farmers 50 years ago, are held in     
 August, September and October, now in 
 a field on the Faceby Road. On 19th   
 September there was an entry of 4013  
 sheep; trade was firm and there was   
 clearance of all lambs. The day was   
 fine but the company was smaller than 
 usual because of this year's late     
 harvest. Prices were: Masham ewes to  
 Â£73, Suffolk Cross ewes to Â£57, lambs 
 to Â£47 and rams to 260 guineas.       
{Fund raising.}For a small village     
 Faceby is outstanding. A mammoth      
 jumble sale in August brought in Â£200;
 a few days later a car-boot sale was  
 held. Twenty traders each paid Â£5 for 
 a stand, a bric-a-brac stall made Â£80 
 and, with refreshments served in the  
 Church Hall throughout the afternoon, 
 the takings reached Â£300, making Â£500 
 in 5 days for church funds.           </content>
