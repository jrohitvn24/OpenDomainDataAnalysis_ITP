		<title>08Boughton's By-pass</title>
		<content> Being on the major route,(ref.p.1),   
 Boughton-under-Blean has had grave    
 problems with traffic during modern   
 times.Luckily in 1976 the by-pass was 
 opened to alleviate this problem.     
   We have carried out a traffic census
 to see what the conditions would be   
 like in The Street had the by-pass not
 been built.                           
   The survey was carried out during   
 part of a morning and afternoon.One   
 part of the survey was taken from the 
 by-pass bridge,and the other from the 
 School Lane section of The Street.    
   The results represent a 10 hour     
 period of a weekday.
