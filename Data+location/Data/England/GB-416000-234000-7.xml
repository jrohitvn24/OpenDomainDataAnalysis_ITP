		<title>07Blockley Garage</title>
		<content> Jason and John interviewed Mr.        
 Stuart-Turner about his garage. We    
 asked him why did he open a garage    
 a he replied that when he was         
 younger he was very interested in     
 motor cars.                           
 He opened a garage in Blockley        
 because the premises were near his    
 home and at a price he could afford.  
 Mr Stuart Turner thinks that Blockley 
 is a very pleasant place to live      
 but from a business point of  view    
 there is not a lot of passing traffic.
 The garage opens at 8.30am and closes 
 at 6.pm but a lot of work is done when
 the garage is closed to the public and
 Mr Stuart -Turner sometimes doesn't   
 finish his work until very late at    
 night but he likes his job.           
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
