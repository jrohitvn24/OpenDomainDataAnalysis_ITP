		<title>03Derwentwater and it's woods</title>
		<content> Derwentwater is named the Queen of the
 lakes because it is known to be the   
 most beautiful lake.Six landing stages
 are placed round the lake.Every year  
 a sort of show is held on Derwent     
 Island. The people are taken across on
 launches. Other Islands consist of    
 Lords Island,St Herberts Island and   
 Rampsholme Island.Derwentwater is one 
 of the main attractions in the Lake   
 District.Beatrix Potter's story       
 Squirrel Nutkin is connected with St  
 Herberts Island.The Old Wise Owl was  
 meant to live on this island.Down at  
 Keswick landing stages there is a gift
 shop,the National Trust shop,a cafe   
 and The Century Theatre.We found out  
 that Vicars Island was purchased in   
 1844 and that the floating islands    
 came into sight in 1847.The floating  
 islands are little islands in Lake    
 Derwentwater,made of dead vegetation. </content>
