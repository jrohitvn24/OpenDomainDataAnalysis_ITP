		<title>10Housing - Rode and Southwick</title>
		<content> Many houses in Rode are 200-300 years 
 old; some are designated listed       
 buildings. New building is strictly   
 limited and extending the boundaries  
 of the villages is forbidden. All new 
 houses must have garage or parking    
 space. 3-bedroomed semi-detached      
 modern houses range from Â£30-35,000   
 and older houses Â£40-65,000. Even     
 derelict properties attract high      
 pricesand there are several houses    
 for sale at over Â£100,000. Building   
 land costs Â£40-60,000 an acre. Most   
 houses are owner-occupied but there is
 some council accomodation, especially 
 for the elderly. Southwick is twice as
 large as Rode and has closer links    
 with Trowbridge. Similar properties   
 tend to be at least Â£5,000 cheaper.   
 There is also much more council       
 housing and large modern housing      
 estates.                              </content>
