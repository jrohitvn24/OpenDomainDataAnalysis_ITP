 Our school serves the whole           
 community. Everyone can come to learn 
 different subjects and skills, to meet
 their friends and join in musical &amp;   
 sporting activities. People come to   
 the community lounge for coffee       
 breaks, to meet their friends &amp; the   
 staff. There are meetings for         
 pensioners, a nursery for pre-school  
 children, and classes for womens' self
 defence, toddlers gym, woodworking,   
 and needlework for the blind. We have 
 a narrow boat called The Kingfisher   
 for holidays on the canals. The       
 Hillfields 'Happening' is our annual  
 carnival which includes our steel band
 and Asian dancers who hold their      
 competition at our school. One can    
 learn languages such as Urdu, Hindi,  
 Spanish, French or Welsh. Our school  
 is for everyone.                      </content>
