		<content>   Once inside our classroom we line up
 for assembly. Then our teacher Mrs.   
 Walsh takes us down to the hall where 
 Sister Brendan our Headteacher is     
 waiting. We read stories, say prayers 
 and sing hymns.                       
   After that we come back to class and
 get changed for swimming lessons in   
 the school pool. I have swum 400      
 metres doing backstroke. First we do a
 good kick to warm up then we practice 
 lengths. When we get out we change in 
 our school caravan and then it's      
 playtime.                             
   After play we do maths and english  
 until dinnertime. At dinner I have a  
 packed lunch. In my lunch I have a    
 peach, salad sandwiches, a chocolate  
 biscuit and a packet of crisps. We    
 play good games in the field like     
 horse and animal games.
