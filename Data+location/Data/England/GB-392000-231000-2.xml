		<content> This is a page about the history of   
 Pamington Court Farm.Pamington is a   
 hamlet in {Ashchurch Parish.}It is    
 recorded in 969 A.D.and its name with 
 the "ton" at the end suggests that the
 settlement developed from a single    
 farm.It does not seem to have         
 increased much in size since then. In 
 medieval times the landscape was      
 very different from today.There were  
 then 4 large open fields, used as     
 arable land or left fallow. These     
 fields were divided between the       
 villagers.Each villager had a number  
 of strips to look after in each       
 field.This landscape  changed after   
 enclosure in the early nineteenth     
 century. Pamington Court Farmhouse was
 built in the Eighteenth Century.It was
 built on a site of the larger previous
 house of which the remains are still  
 buried to the North of the farm.      </content>
