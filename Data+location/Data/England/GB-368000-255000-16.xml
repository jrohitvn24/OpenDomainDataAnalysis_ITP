  My Great Grandfather came as a tenant
 to Lincetter Farm in 1903.In 1919 he  
 bought the farm from Mr Lutley of     
 Brockhampton.                         
 My great Grandmother made enough      
 bread in one day  to last the family a
 weeks supply.Butter was always made on
 a Wednesday to be taken to Bromyard on
 Thursdays by horse and trap to keep   
 the butter cool in the summer time.It 
 was put in a bread basket and lowered 
 down into the well.                   
  Rhubarb leaves were often used to    
 pack round it for its journey to      
 Bromyard market.During the war years  
 farmers were made to plough up more   
 ground to grow more food shuch as     
 corn,sugar,beet and potatoes.         
  The old people worked very long hours
 no half days and no pay.
