		<content> Although the area is rural, it is not 
 without some form of employment and   
 trade. The stud farm, farms and riding
 stables do provide work, be it self   
 employment, part time and or seasonal.
 The four public houses engage extra   
 help as and when the need arises.     
 Faygate has the most industry. The    
 Holmbush public house, a garage, a    
 scrapyard and timber yard, the station
 a forge and a transport cafe all offer
 work.                                 
 The people of Faygate, like those of  
 Colgate now travel to Horsham or      
 Crawley to shop. Further along the    
 road to Crawley there is a farm shop  
 sellling both fresh and frozen        
 meat.Close by is large timber and     
 builders supply merchants serving both
 trade and retail. Behind this are ten 
 large warehouse units, some of which  
 are occupied by variety of trades.    </content>
