		<title>11Out migration in Manchester</title>
		<content>  The area to the east of the city     
 centre once had thriving local        
 communities employed in traditional   
 industries such as textiles.          
  Changing economic and social         
 circumstances have produced decline   
 and decay. With the expansion of the  
 city centre and post war redevelopment
 in general there has been little room 
 for housing. This has meant that the  
 population movement has been out of   
 the central areas.                    
  Many owner occupiers have moved into 
 the outer suburbs leaving the area    
 dominated by council housing.         
  One recent change in this pattern has
 been the establishment of 'penthouse' 
 units on the top of the Arndale Centre
 in the heart of the city and more     
 recent private building in newly      
 cleared areas e.g. Belle Vue.
