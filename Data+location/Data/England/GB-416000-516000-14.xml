{The Spa}is a font like structure      
 situated between Gainford and Winston 
 beside the{River Tees.}Last century it
 was described as a sulphurous spring. 
 It smells like rotten eggs but tastes 
 like drinking water. The{mineral water
 came out of rocks into the spa, which 
 now flows into the river. It was      
 thought that the{spa water}would      
 attract many people and Gainford would
 become a holiday centre. Houses were  
 built along{South View}in{Gainford}for
 people to come from all over the      
 country to sample some of the mineral 
 water which was said to have{special  
{healing qualities.}Unfortunately,the  
 tourist attraction did not flourish,  
 and today the spa is only of local    
 interest. The boarding houses are now 
 used as people's homes.
