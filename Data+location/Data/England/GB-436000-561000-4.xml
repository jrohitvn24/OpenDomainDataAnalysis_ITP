		<title>04SHOPPING SURVEY:CLEADON</title>
		<content> To do our shopping survey we inter-   
 viewed people shopping and shop-      
 keepers.This is a small sample of     
 village shoppers.                     
 Laws'Supermarket_most people shop     
 twice a week.Newsagents_customers call
 in every day.Bakers_people like fresh 
 bread and shop six days a week. Green-
 grocers_people buy fresh fruit and    
 vegetables nearly every day.Fish-     
 monger_fish seems to be bought once a 
 week.                                 
 We have the only equestrian shop in   
 the area.When I lived in North York-  
 shire my mam sent to this shop for my 
 riding hat and boots.Other customers  
 come from as far away as Durham,      
 Tyneside and Consett.Thursday is the  
 busiest day as the shop is open until 
 7 p.m. It looks like a tack room and  
 smells of leather.
