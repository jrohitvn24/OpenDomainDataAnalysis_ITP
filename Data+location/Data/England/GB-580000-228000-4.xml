		<content> On Fridays I get up, get washed and   
 dressed then I go downstairs to get my
 breakfast. After that I make my lunch 
 and drink and put them in my bag. I   
 learn my spellings and I help my      
 brother and sister get their shoes on.
 I put my own shoes and coat on then we
 all go to school. On the way I        
 sometimes meet my friends Rebecca and 
 Alison. When we get to school we wait 
 for Karen then we go into the         
 playground, when the bell goes we go  
 in. We write out numbers in our Maths 
 and English books then we do our      
 spellings. After that we have hymn    
 practice then we do our sums, I       
 sometimes finish before the others so 
 I can do sewing. Then it is first     
 play. We then mark our sums. After    
 lunch we finish giving in our marks,  
 have last play, clear our desks, tidy 
 up and go home at 3.20pm.             </content>
