		<title>08THE MILL AT ELMSWELL</title>
		<content> In Elmswell there is a mill, and one  
 day I went to see how it works.  The  
 mill makes animal feed for the local  
 farmers, from British wheat, barley   
 and oats, and maize from the U.S.A.   
 which arrives at the docks at Ipswich,
 Colchester, Yarmouth and London.  When
 stores come in they are put in bulk   
 storage bins. Then when it is time to 
 mill, the right amount is weighed out 
 on automatic scales. Then it is put   
 into one of the two hammer mills. Then
 it goes to the ring roll press to be  
 pelleted. When the pellets come out   
 they are cooled, then they are put in 
 big containers and put on lorries to  
 be taken to the farms.                
 The mill is powered by electricity. It
 used to be powered by oil. Three men  
 work full time (47 hours) and one     
 works part time.                      
                                       </content>
