		<content> Children play games in the street     
 e.g.40 40 or Kerbie.You have a        
 football and you throw  it at the     
 kerb aiming to hit it.If you do you   
 get 1 point.Then the other person has 
 a go.The first person to get 10 points
 wins.Some children play games in the  
 playground e.g. skipping,hopscotch and
 British Bulldog.You have about 20/30  
 people. One person is it.The other    
 people stand in a line,the person     
 picks somebody to try to run          
 over another line without the person  
 who is it catching him.If the person  
 who is it does not say,"no tag,no     
 split tag"after the name of the       
 person,the person who is pickedcan tag
 another person to run instead.If the  
 first person made it everybody else   
 has to make it over the line,if he or 
 she is caught then they are it.Then it
 starts again.                         </content>
