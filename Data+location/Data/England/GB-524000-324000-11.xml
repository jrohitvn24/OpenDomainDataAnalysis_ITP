		<title>11MY GRANDAD'S SCHOOL DAY (1)</title>
		<content>    My grandad's name is Alf Bemrose   
 and in 1935 I was  13 years old. I got
 up at 7.30 and then I would go down   
 for my breakfast. I would  have force 
 cerial, a slice of home cured bacon   
 and some bread and home made butter . 
 At 8.15 I had to feed the pet rabbit .
    At 8.40 I left home and biked 3    
 miles to school at Pode Hole. At 9.00 
 the bell would ring and we stood in   
 lines and then went in. At 9.10 we    
 would do scripture. At 9.30 we did    
 sums and at 10.00 we had a botttle of 
 milk which held 1/3 of a pint and then
 go outside to play a game of football.
    At 10.15 we went in again when we  
 did football training until 12.00. We 
 took sandwiches to eat. I had fat     
 bacon sandwiches, home made cake and  
 orange squash. After dinner we played 
 until 1.00.
