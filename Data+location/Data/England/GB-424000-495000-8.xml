		<content> The main form of transport in this    
 area is by road.                      
 There are no railway stations locally 
 since the Richmond line was closed.The
 nearest railway stations being        
{Darlington}and{Northallerton.         
 There are bus services that run       
 between Catterick Village,Richmond and
 Darlington.The remaining parts of the 
 area are without bus services.        
 The main A1 carries a great deal of   
 traffic except on Sundays.Heavy       
 lorries,long distance buses and a     
 range of commercial vehicles together 
 with motor cars,all use the A1.       
 The A1 is not a motorway but a dual   
 carriageway with a speed limit of     
 60mph.Since the roundabouts at        
 Catterick have been replaced by       
 fly-overs in 1984 the traffic flow has
 improved.
