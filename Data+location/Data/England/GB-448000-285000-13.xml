		<content> In 1985/1986 some familes live in     
 houses or flats owned by the{Council  
 or other landlords,but many people own
 their{own houses}or are buying them   
 with the help of a mortgage.          
    There is{no gas}main in Ullesthorpe
 so, people either cook by electricity 
 or "bottled" gas.Many people now have 
 micro_wave ovens which reduce the     
 time needed to prepare a meal, as food
 can be removed from the freezer and   
 ready in a very few minutes.          
 Local children seem to be quite       
 equally divided about whether they    
 would prefer hot or cold meals.       
    Many of the families have domestic 
 pets with cats and dogs being most    
 popular.Others include rabbits,guinea 
 pigs, hamsters and a parrot.
