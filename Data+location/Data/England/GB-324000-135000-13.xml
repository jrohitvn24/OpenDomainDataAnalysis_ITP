		<title>13THE MANOR HOUSE</title>
		<content> problem one had lost its roof and had 
 to have a new one.The workers also had
 to take down the towers down to put in
 new foundations and then rebuild      
 them.Mr.Martin keeps discovering new  
 things. Recently he discovered a      
 staircase that would have lead up to  
 the battlements,and a passage to the  
 bottom of the tower.There is a door   
 that has been there since the manor   
 was built.Mr.Martin made a lead plaque
 to celebrate moving in.Between the    
 towers was an arch that coaches went  
 through but he has blocked it up.In   
 1490 there used to be 50-60 people    
 living here.Originally there were more
 towers,now two and a half.He owns one 
 and a half acres.They discovered the  
 old well when the farmer was putting  
 up fences.Mr Martin is not allowed to 
 fish,swim or sail on the resevoir.
