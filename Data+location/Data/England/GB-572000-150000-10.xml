		<title>10Housing in the Coxheath area</title>
		<content> The majority of housing in the        
 Coxheath area is concentrated around  
 the centre of the village.  Most of   
 the housing is post-war semi-detached 
 houses which are owner-occupied.      
 There are also terraced cottages, a   
 few converted oast houses and large   
 detached houses can be found in Dean  
 Street.  There are also a small number
 of detached properties in the village 
 and some bungalows.                   
                                       
 At the present time (July 1985) the   
 price of a typical three bedroom      
 semi-detached house in the area varies
 from Â£34,000 to Â£44,000 depending on  
 the size of the property.
