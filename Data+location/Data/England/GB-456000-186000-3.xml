		<content>{Aeroplanes} fly in the air carrying   
people and goods around the world. The 
biggest passenger plane is the {Jumbo  
Jet,} the fastest is {Concorde} which  
travels at twice the speed of sound. A 
captain is in control and must get     
permission to take off or land at the  
airport. Most large aircraft need a    
runway several miles long for take off 
and landing. The plane can fly on      
autopilot once it has taken off. A     
steward or stewardess looks after the  
passengers and brings their meals.     
Special aviation fuel is used for these
jet aircraft and {Concorde} carries    
26,000 gallons, enough to fly 4,400    
miles. Small {private aircraft} may    
carry only a few people and have a     
propellor as the source of power. There
are also {helicopters,} with overhead  
rotor blades which can take off and    
land vertically.                       </content>
