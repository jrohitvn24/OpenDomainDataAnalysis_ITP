		<title>11Hurdle making</title>
		<content>  Hurdle making is an ancient art.In   
 our area the number of hurdle makers  
 has dwindled down to {three}.The art  
 is usually passed down the line from  
 generation to generation.At{7:00 a.m. 
{Mr Lockyear}would go to the wood if   
 weather permits it.He begins by plac- 
 ing{9}ready cut{sails}into a{wooden}  
 frame.These sails are{hazel or maple} 
 uprights and the frame is a wooden    
 pole with{9}holes drilled in it. He   
 then begins weaving thin rods of wood 
 in and out between the sails.This is  
 called{bottoming.}Any extra length is 
 twisted until the bark breaks and then
 is woven back through the sails. To   
 achieve a pattern he splits the rods  
 in half and so has a dark and a light 
 side. A contractor buys most of what  
 he makes.The hurdles,which sell for   
{Â£1.50/ft,are often used for fencing.
