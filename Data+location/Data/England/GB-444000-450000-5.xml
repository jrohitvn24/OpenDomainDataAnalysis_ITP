		<content>{      Job Survey 1.}                  
   This survey was conducted to find   
 out where heads of households work.   
   From our survey we found out that:  
   10% work locally (i.e. in villages  
 or on farms in our block)             
   26% work within a 10 mile radius.   
   50% work in towns (i.e. more than 10
 miles away in York, Leeds, Harrogate  
 or Wakefield.)                        
   14% travel all over the U.K.        
   We deduced that Tockwith, Bilton and
 Bickerton are basically commuter      
 villages with most people travelling  
 out to work.                          
   The average journey per day to and  
 from work is 55 miles. The greatest   
 daily distance is 150 miles, and the  
 smallest is half a mile. One exception
 can travel between 100 and 10 000     
 miles daily, worldwide, by air! Most  
 travel by company or private car.     </content>
