		<content> The Lawley is covered in short grass  
 and bracken and is used for sheep     
 pasture. Lodge Hill and Hoar Edge are 
 covered in a variety of conifers      
 planted in the last 30 yrs. The lower 
 land in the west is improved grassland
 mainly grazed by Friesian Dairy       
 Cattle. There are also some large     
 arable fields containing Wheat and    
 Barley. patches of Deciduous woodland 
 have been retained to provide cover   
 for foxes. Some of the land between   
 Hoar edge and the lawley  is still    
 unimproved and  wilderness of         
 boulders,bracken gorse, heather and   
 sedge on which sheep and a few horses 
 graze.  Between Chatwell and Hoar edge
 much of the land has been improved to 
 provide grassland for sheep and beef  
 cattle. Most of the farmland is in    
 good condition a sign of the          
 prosperity of farming since the 50s.  </content>
