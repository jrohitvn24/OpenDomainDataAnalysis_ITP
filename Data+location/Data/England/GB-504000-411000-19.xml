		<content> Within this square (11 04),in South   
 Humberside there are only 8 seperate  
 households living in 7 houses.Evidence
 of 3 recently abandoned house sites   
 was found.The details on the 1982     
 1:25000 ordnance survey TA01/11 were  
 found to be inaccurate re. buildings. 
 In every case at least one member,    
 normally it's male head, is employed  
 in Agriculture; except one gardener   
 who works for a farmer. A further 16  
 people travel in to work here,10 in   
 industry,6 in farming.                
 5 years ago a sales engineer started  
 a buiness repairing farm machinery.   
 This enterprise now operates from a   
 2000 sq.foot workshop at Moor Farm.   
 There are 3 full time mechanics,plus  
 the boss.25 to 30 tractors are sold   
 each year,plus other equipment, pea   
 harvesters being a speciality.Most of 
 the customers are within 25 miles.    </content>
