		<content> The group recorded an interview with  
 one of Tempsford oldest               
 inhabitants.Mr.J.Gosling is invovled  
 in village life in a number of ways.He
 told us just how the village has      
 changed in his lifetime.              
 Mr. Gosling family has farmed in      
 Tempford for centuries.The present day
 population of the village is around   
 400 this figure being more or less    
 static since the turn of the          
 century.Soon after world war one 30   
 council houses were built to replace  
 much older properties.Today a small   
 number of private houses have been    
 built in the village but only on an   
 infilling basis.The former country    
 residence of the Stuart family        
 Tempsford Hall was rebuilt after being
 gutted by fire in 1898 this stands on 
 high ground surrounded by 100 acres of
 parkland.                             </content>
