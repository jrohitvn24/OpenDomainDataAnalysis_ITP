		<title>09THE WATER TOWER</title>
		<content> An act of Parliament in 1878 secured a
 perpetual{supply of water}to          
 Westhoughton at 6d(2.5p)per 1000      
 gallons.The minimum to be paid for is 
 50,000 gallons a day and the maximum  
 we are entitled to is 400,000 galls.  
    Prior to 1915 there were complaints
 of a poor water supply.{Councillor    
{Basnett}stated that North Ward could  
 never get sufficient water on{Mondays}
 (washing day).As a result a water tank
 was built at{Snydale Hill}.The top    
 water level was at 530ft and gave a   
 constant water pressure throughout    
 Westhoughton.The tank's{capacity}was  
 200,000 galls(1 day's supply).In 1980 
 an{underground reservoir}was completed
 making the old tower obselete.It was  
 sold and plans were passed to{convert 
{it into a dwelling}.This has never    
 been completed.It stands,its top      
 removed, falling into decay.          </content>
