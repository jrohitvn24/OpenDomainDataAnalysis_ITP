		<title>17TRAFFIC SURVEY IN HAMPTON</title>
		<content> We did a traffic survey on the corner 
 of the Uxbridge Road by Hampton Hill  
 and Bushy Park. We counted the traffic
 for 15 mins.in three catagories. Local
 traffic included cars vans and        
 motorbikes. Public transport included 
 buses coaches and taxis.Then we       
 counted heavy lorries.The amount of   
 local traffic in both directions in 1 
 hour was 900 vehicles. Public         
 transport was 36 per hour. Heavy      
 lorries was 48 per hour. The reason   
 the Uxbridge Road was so busy is      
 because it was rush hour and the road 
 links up two airports (Heathrow and   
 Gatwick) and two motorways (M3 and    
 M4). At the moment a new motorway is  
 being built , this is the M25. This   
 will hopefully cut down the amount of 
 traffic along the road and the noise.
