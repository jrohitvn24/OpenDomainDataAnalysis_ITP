		<title>02The Shropshire Union Canal</title>
		<content>     The canal which we surveyed was   
 the Montgomeryshire branch of the     
 Shropshire Union canal.. The canal is 
 now disused and this is probably due  
 to the coming of the railway.  The    
 canal is now dry and reeds cover the  
 muddy bottom.                         
     The only place where water lies is
 a place called Devil's Hole.  Legend  
 says that anyone who falls in is      
 pulled under by the devil.            
     The stretch of canal we studied   
 was roughly three miles long and had  
 three bridges crossing it.  The       
 bridges were made of stone, but over  
 the years they have been repaired with
 modern day bricks.  Most of the       
 bridges are of the same design, they  
 are mostly hump-back bridges.
