		<title>12Appleby Library</title>
		<content>    We have one library at Appleby.It  
 is upstairs in the clinic.Quite a lot 
 of people go there.You have to be very
 quiet in the library because people   
 work there and find out useful        
 imformation.At the library you can    
 take books out and fetch them back on 
 certain days and you can also take out
 magazines.They have thousands of books
 for your interests.Before you can get 
 a book out you have to have a ticket  
 and the librarian takes the ticket out
 of the book and she stamps a label    
 inside it.                            
    Downstairs there is a room for old 
 people and they have their dinner     
 there and play dominoes and cards.They
 call it a day centre. There is a      
 chiropodist but only senior citizens  
 can go.
