		<content>    {BROWNIE BANNER }                  
   We made a Brownie Banner for the    
 celebration at the Forbury Gardens    
 because we are 75 this year. It all   
 started when Lady Baden-Powell decided
 to make Brownies but they were called 
 Rosebuds. They enjoyed it except their
 name so they changed it to Brownies.  
 The year Rosebuds started was 1910.   
     {LEISURE TRAVEL}                  
   Travelling by car is favourite      
 because it is so convenient. Buses and
 trains cannot always get to country   
 roads. Trains are more expensive but  
 are useful to go to London or main    
 cities where it is difficult to park. 
 Buses are more convenient to go into  
 town in because they have special     
 places reserved for them (bus stops)  
 and they can travel along special bus 
 lanes. Cars are not practical for     
 shopping as car parks are expensive.  </content>
