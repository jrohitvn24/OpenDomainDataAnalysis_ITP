		<content> There were many Clay-pits in the area 
 at one time. The clay being used      
 locally to make tiles, plant-pots and 
 bricks for local buildings. The local 
 streams were harnessed to provide     
 water power for grinding corn and     
 bone, and also for the making of silk 
 crepe. The land produced good grass   
 land and supported dairy herds, and   
 allied industries such as cheese      
 making and a tannery. Other industries
 which have died out are:- basket      
 making, spinning, a paint works, coal 
 merchants; only two small nurseries, a
 blacksmiths and a little farming are  
 now in evidence.
