		<title>11St.John's Church, Acklington</title>
		<content>{Acklington Church}was built in 1861.  
 Before 1861 there was a tin chapel    
 where the people of Acklington Village
 went to worship. The present vicar    
 (who is also vicar of Warkworth) is   
{Rev.Canon Anthony Duncan.}He has      
 worked in Acklington for 6\ years.    
 The main service in Acklington is the 
{Sunday Holy Communion}at 10.30 a.m.   
 Average congregation is about 30.     
 Records show that the first marriage  
 in the church dates back to 1862.     
 Since then{228 weddings}have taken    
 place in St.John's Church.            
 A major problem for church members    
 this year is finding Â£3,000 to cover  
 the cost of repairs to the walls and a
 new boiler. Various{fund-raising      
{events}have been planned, including   
 the following efforts from last month:
 Coffee Morning{Â£116;}Produce Stall{Â£14
 Musical Concert{Â£85;}Summer Fete{Â£196.</content>
