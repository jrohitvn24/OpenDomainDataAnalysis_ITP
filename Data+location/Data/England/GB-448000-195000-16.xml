       ATTACK ON PANDA CAR             
A bomb scare in an Abingdon night club 
sparked off a wave of violence when a  
Police car was sent to investigate.    
A teenager spotted the police car in   
a nearby car park and immediately      
started banging on the car roof.Then   
he tried to break off the blue flashing
light on top of the car,but when he    
failed ,he bent the aerial,before      
running off.Abingdon magistrates were  
told that three hundred and twenty one 
pounds worth of damage had been done to
the vehicle.
