never completed and children continued 
to be educated in the church.In 1721

pounds p/a for the teaching of 50 poor 
children 25 boys and 25 girls. In 1841 
Thomas Kelsey built the infant school  
in Chequer Lane at his own expense in

aged 3-8 years.In 1819 Mrs Elizabeth   
Godfrey gave 1000 pounds for the junior

were moved to Sandwich Central School
