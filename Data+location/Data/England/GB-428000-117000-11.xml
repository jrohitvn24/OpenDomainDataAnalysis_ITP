		<title>11 Housing in Wellow (cont'd)</title>
		<content>Most properties have been modernised.  
   The cottages lie between large      
modern estates.These areas leading from
Maury's Lane have a few containing     
bungalows,2 bedrooms,bay windows and   
garages.Wellow's population grew       
rapidly in the 1940's when evacuees    
settled here.The population is         
increasing as people have found that   
Wellow is convenient for work.         
  The modern estates are situated      
around Maury's Lane.They are expensive 
,four bedroomed with double garages    
built of brick and wooden panels.      
  The West Wellow villagers are        
opinionated about the modernisation.   
Some believe that there is no longer a 
neighbourly atmosphere in the now large
village.Others think that the increased
population boosts business,trade and   
finance.
