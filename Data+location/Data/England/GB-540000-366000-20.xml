		<title>20PARTNEY FESTIVAL JUNE 1985</title>
		<content> Partney last held a festival in 1978. 
 They can not have one every           
 year,because there is too much work.  
 They thought it was a good idea to    
 get people working together.The       
 prepartions took at least 2 months    
 before hand.A Lot of people came      
 because the church was open all day.  
 The festival started at 11 o,clock and
 lasted till evening.The festival was a
 success.People seemed to enjoy        
 different parts.1 or 2 people came to 
 the services who never came before.   
 They cannot hold one next year because
 it takes too much arranging.They      
 expect in the future,quite a few      
 changes,for instance there could be a 
 lady vicar. In this area there,were 15
 clergy in 1970 but now there are only 
 seven.
