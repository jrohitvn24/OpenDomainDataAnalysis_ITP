		<title>04A Farm in Blakesley.</title>
		<content>The farm is about 250acres in size and 
is split up into approximately 170acres
of arable land and 80acres of          
grassland.It is a family run farm with 
all of the farming members being       
partners in the business.In Autumn, we 
are busy making the silage to feed to  
the animals in the winter.To make the  
silage we mow the grass one day and    
then the following day the grass is    
baled up into large round bales. The   
bal are then put into polythene bags,  
sealed up and left until required.After
the first cut of grass for silage there
will then be a break of a few weeks    
during which time we prepare everything
for the start of harvest.
