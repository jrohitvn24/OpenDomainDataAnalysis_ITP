		<content> Pennoxstone is a fruit farm where     
 people come to pick their own         
 raspberries, peas, sweetcorn, and     
 other things. 25 tons of strawberries 
 were sent to market last year, mostly 
 to Birmingham. 88 tons of cider apples
 were sent to Hereford. If the full    
 trays of strawberries had been stacked
 up, the stack would have been 3000    
 feet high.                            
    Aramstone is a grassland farm with 
 beef cattle and some horses. Sometimes
 they have a Field Sports Fair with gun
 dog trials, falconry, lurcher racing  
 and fly casting competitions. There is
 a salmon in a glass case which weighed
 over 59 lbs when it was caught here.
