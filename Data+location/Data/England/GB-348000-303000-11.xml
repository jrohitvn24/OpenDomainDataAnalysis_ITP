		<title>11THE WORK OF THE CHURCH</title>
		<content> All kinds of people help in the church
 ;members of Condover church choir,the 
 only choir now existing out of the    
 four parishes,the organist, cleaners ,
 church wardens and PCC members.These  
 people try to help in a variety of    
 ways and often pratise the  skills    
 they are already expert in. A         
 stewardship campaign is in operation  
 to increase the membership of the     
 church.Money collected in the church  
 is used for the immediate expenses of 
 running the church.Money is also given
 away to help poorer countries.The     
 diocese of Hereford is paid a quota   
 from church funds and this in turn    
 finds it's way back to the parish in  
 the form of stipend -pay- for it's    
 vicar and  building maintenence for   
 the local church Aided Primary School.
