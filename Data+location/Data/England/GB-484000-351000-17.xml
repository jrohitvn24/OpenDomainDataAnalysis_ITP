		<title>17Beckingham(Lincs) _ Church</title>
		<content>  At Beckingham as in so  many villages
 it is the  church  which  has the most
 obvious  connection  with  the   past.
 There  was a church and a priest  here
 at the time of  the  original Domesday
 Book  and there  is  a  church  and  a
 priest  here  today.                  
  Although  the  church  today  is much
 larger  than  in the  eleventh century
 when it would have been no larger than
 the  present chancel  it is sadly in a
 poor  state of repair. Rain  comes  in
 through the  roof of the  nave and the
 whole   structure  is  suffering  from
 neglect. The  only improvement made in
 recent years has  been  to  the  19th.
 century    clock   which   has    been
 electrified.                          
  The eighteenth century rectory is one
 of  the  largest  in  the  county  and
 similarly the living at Beckingham was
 one of the most lucrative.            </content>
