		<title>02SWALE BOROUGH COUNCIL</title>
		<content> In 1974 the Swale Borough Council     
 superceded the Sittingbourne and      
 Milton Council.It encompassed 5 other 
 authorities.Harry White,chief         
 executive since 1979,said his most    
 important job was to keep both Swale  
 people happy and the council's        
 employees content.The most important  
 jobs of the council are:housing;the   
 road network;road resurfacing;        
 investing money and planning for new  
 building.The problem of housing brings
 most public complaints.Swale owns     
 roughly 10,000 houses but there is a  
 waiting list of about 400 people.     
 Vandalism is costly but Swale has less
 than many areas.Unemployment is       
 relatively low.Council members regret 
 that the public use their right to    
 listen in during council meetings.The 
 Mayor has an important public         
 relations role.                       </content>
