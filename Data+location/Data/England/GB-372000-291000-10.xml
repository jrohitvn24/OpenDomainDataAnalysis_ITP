 Living on the Grove estate above old  
 Lowtown,Mr.Bill Williams,a resident of
 Bridgnorth the whole of his 84 years  
 told us some changes he had           
 noticed."More things to do and see    
 than in my day"."More shops in Lowtown
 today,there only used to be J.C.Lloyd 
 the grocer at the bridge end.He could 
 remember when the whole of the Grove  
 area was no more than"open fields with
 rabbits in them,it was pretty then."  
 When asked what changes he would like 
 to see,Mr.Williams replied:"the boats 
 back on the river and the whole river 
 side made tidy again."Mr.Williams     
 lives at the top of a flight of steps 
 which lead down to Lowtown. These     
 steps could tell many a tale,dark and 
 dank, closed in by a high wall.
