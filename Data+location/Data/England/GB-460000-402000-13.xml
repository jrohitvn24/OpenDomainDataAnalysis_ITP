		<title>13CHANGING TIMES IN ARMTHORPE</title>
		<content>{ A child's life}in Armthorpe{around   
{1920}was very different from that of  
 children today.                       
  There were just a few old cottages   
 surrounded by woods and fields,which  
 disappeared as the village developed. 
  Children had a long walk to{school  }
 and returned home for lunch.They      
 attended school from 5 years to 14    
 years.Writing was done on slates and  
 they did not have the variety of      
 equipment or lessons of today.The     
 school day was about the same length  
 as it is today.                       
  There weren't any buses but on market
 days you could sometimes get a lift to
 town on a horse and cart.{Cooking}was 
 done on a coal fire and there weren't 
 any electric irons or washers.They had
{bathrooms}but children were bathed in 
 tin tubs in front of the fire.{Good   
{children}were given a penny on Friday.</content>
