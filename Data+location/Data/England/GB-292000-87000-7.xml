		<title>07The Hospital</title>
		<content> For the last hundred years, the life  
 of Exminster has been particulary     
 involved with the very large mental   
 hospital which is on the north-west   
 side or the village. At one time this 
 housed 1600 patients who are mentally 
 ill and it had a staff of nearly a    
 thousand including doctors, nurses,   
 caterers and administrative staff.    
 Many of thes people lived in the      
 village of Exminster.                 
                                       
 In 1987 the hospital is to close and  
 the large site - about a square       
 kilometer - is to be developed for    
 housing. All of the patients are to be
 housed in sheltered housing or in     
 local authority care. Many of the     
 staff will either retire or move to   
 work in Torquay.
