		<content> There are two Methodist Churches in   
 the area but no Anglican Church. Part 
 of the area is in Heatherycleugh Par- 
 ish,served by the Church of St.Thomas 
 at Cowshill which replaced the old    
 church at Copt Hill in 1914, and part 
 in the Parish of St.John in Weardale, 
 served by the Church of St.John the   
 Baptist rebuilt in 1752. The incumb-  
 ent of both livings, together with    
 St.Andrews,Westgate, lives at the     
 Cowshill Vicarage.  The Methodist Min-
 ister, whose circuit covers the same  
 area, lives in the Westgate Manse. The
 Methodist Church of High House, built 
 in Ireshopeburn in 1760, is of espec- 
 ial interest because of its associa-  
 tion with John Wesley and because it  
 is the second oldest Methodist Church 
 in England still in use. It has rec-  
 ently been renovated as has Wearhead  
 Methodist Church, built in 1826.      </content>
