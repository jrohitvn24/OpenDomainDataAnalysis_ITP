		<title>03AFTER SCHOOL</title>
		<content>    When I get home each afternoon from
 school I go and see if my fowls have  
 laid any eggs; usually we have 4 eggs 
 from 6 fowls.  Then I go and get      
 changed and do some homework.         
    After I've done some homework I go 
 and get out my B.M.X. (a B.M.X. is a  
 bicycle used for stunts).  Then I call
 for a friend and see if he is coming  
 out on his B.M.X.  Sometimes we go and
 call for another friend and we go down
 the lanes.  Down one of the lanes is a
 really steep hill and if we get a good
 run up, we go really fast down the    
 hill.  Sometimes we find rusty horse- 
 shoes.                                
    At half past five I go home to have
 some tea.  After tea I usually stay   
 inside until I go to bed.  At seven   
 o'clock I go and feed our cats.  At   
 eight o'clock I go and feed my fowls.
