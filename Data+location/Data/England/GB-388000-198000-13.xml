		<title>13ATTITUDES IN CHERINGTON</title>
		<content> This part of the South Cotswolds is a 
 beautiful area to live in, and lots of
 well-known people live in the nearby. 
 Princess Anne and her husband,        
 Captain Mark Phillips, live at        
 Gatcombe Park.  We think that the     
 old-styled houses should be kept in   
 the villages instead of putting up new
 estates.  There is a lack of things to
 do in the evenings and during holiday 
 times.  There are not many restaurants
 in the area either.                   
 In the villages there is a lack of    
 parking spaces, especially when       
 tourists come to visit.
