		<title>01A GENERAL SURVEY</title>
		<content> There is a remarkable contrast in what
 is known of the past of the two       
 villages within our block.{Aston      
{Ingham}has a documented history since 
 it's inclusion in the original        
{Domesday Book}although it existed     
 centuries before this. On the other   
 hand there appears to be no reference 
 to the history of{Cliffords Mesne}at  
 all and all that we have found out has
 been by talking to residents of long- 
 standing.                             
     Both parishes were of a very      
 scattered nature until recent years   
 when  a small amount of new housing   
 has been permitted in both Aston      
 Ingham and Cliffords Mesne and which  
 now forms a small centre to each      
 village.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
