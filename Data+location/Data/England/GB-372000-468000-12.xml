		<title>12ECOLOGY.CLAPHAM RIVER BANK</title>
		<content> On Wednesday the 26 June we went to   
 the beck.It was a fine day but the    
 water was cold and fast flowing       
 because it had been raining the       
 night before.In the water we saw      
 flies,snails, and out of the water we 
 saw ladybirds, duck eggs,midges,      
 bees,and slugs,there are some mink and
 water rats but we didn't see any.Along
 the bank we saw different             
 flowers,meadow buttercup,red          
 clover,nettles,bush vetch,woody night 
 shade,cuckoo flower,and celandines.   
 There were sycamore,and ash trees by  
 the beck,and there was a flowering    
 cherry.We brought some insects        
 back to school to identify then after 
 a while we took them back.A few of the
 plants were "garden escapes"or just   
 the seeds of a garden plant been blown
 out.                                  
                                       </content>
