		<content>      Many of the traders specialise in
 one product often of a specialist     
 nature, like the cycle manufacturer of
 tandem light weight cycle frames and  
 the toys and games manufacturers that 
 concentrate on making hand painted    
 'Smurfs'.                             
                                       
      One of the biggest storage       
 wharehouses on Thorp Arch is called   
 Moore's Furniture Group. The land was 
 bought after the war by George Moore  
 who started the Trading Estate.       
                                       
      Some of the larger factories     
 provide buses or mini buses, for      
 their workers as there is no public   
 transport. Most of Thorpe Arch        
 employees travel by car from the      
 surrounding villages. Most employees  
 live within seven miles vicinity.
