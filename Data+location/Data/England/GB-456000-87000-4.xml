		<content>   Mr and Mrs J Rayment live in a small
 lane near Gatehouse Farm. Since the   
 war, not much has changed.There are   
 only 3 extra bungalows, and the       
 railway has closed.The{old station    
 at the bottom of the lane has been    
 converted into a smart house.It is    
 very peaceful to live there.          
  As it's out in the country,there are 
 not any shops. Mrs Rayment goes to    
 Tesco for her shopping. Some mornings,
 she gets pheasants, woodpeckers and   
 mallard ducks in the garden.          
  Mrs Rayment has a dog, a cat, a      
 budgie, a tortoise and 15 goldfish.   
 She is also looking after her         
 daughter's pet chinchilla.
