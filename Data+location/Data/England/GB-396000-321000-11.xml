		<title>11TIXALL VILLAGE</title>
		<content>Tixall is a small rural village with   
about 14 houses.The cottages are about 
200 to 300 years old,and several are   
empty.Most of the village is owned by  
2 local landowners.                    
  The old day school,now the village   
hall   is  used as a Sunday School by  
the church and as a playgroup. The     
playgroup has 12   to 20 children,but  
only 3 to 4 come from Tixall,most come 
from Great Haywood. A fete takes place 
once a   year.The village hall is used 
for childrens parties,or the fete if   
it is raining.                         
  The church was built about 1600,and a
service is held once every 2 weeks but 
only between 10 and 20 people attend.  
  There are no shops since the         
post office closed in 1973,but a mobile
libary,calls once every 2 weeks.There  
is a bus service into Stafford on      
Tuesdays,Fridays and  Saturdays.       </content>
