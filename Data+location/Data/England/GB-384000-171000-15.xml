		<content> THE ROYAL BRITISH LEGION              
      An organisation formed after the 
 1914/18 war to attend to the needs of 
 ex-servoce men and women, particularly
 those who were disabled. The village  
 branch has been in existence since the
 1950's when it divided the Castle     
 Combe and Yatton Keynell branch into  
 two. Committee meetings are held      
 monthly at the White Horse and all    
 members are welcome to attend.        
 THE 1ST BIDDESTONE BROWNIE GUIDES     
      The junior section of the Girl   
 Guides Association.  The Biddestone   
 Pack has been warranted since 1947 and
 has operated continuously since that  
 date. It meets in the garden of Elm   
 Lodge every Monday to learn useful    
 skills and to have fun. Any girl from 
 the age of seven to eleven is welcome.
