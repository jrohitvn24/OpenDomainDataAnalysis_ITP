		<content> To cure a sore throat a sock would be 
 placed round the neck, or the patient 
 would be fed bread &amp; butter which had 
 been down a pit. Others relate to     
 birth and death.  A robin's nest built
 close to a house indicates a death or 
 birth in the family.  A newly born    
 baby has to be lifted above the head, 
 its palm crossed with silver, its     
 clothes have to be pulled upwards over
 its feet, and on its first visit to a 
 neighbour's house it's given wood     
 matches &amp; coal to kindle the flame of 
 love.  In the event of a death, a     
 service is held at the house before   
 the coffin is lifted, and the girls   
 carry the coffin of a deceased child.
