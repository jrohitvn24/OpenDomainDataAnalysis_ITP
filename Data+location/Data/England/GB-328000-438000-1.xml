 Blackpool is a very popular holiday   
 resort in the North-West of England.  
 Many years ago people used to come to 
 Blackpool for the sea-water and sea   
 air, as these were supposed to be good
 for the health. Nowadays there are    
 many more attractions, including the  
 Illuminations and the trams, both of  
 which can be seen in this part of     
 Blackpool.                            
 The area we are covering is generally 
 referred to as North Shore and the    
 beach here is perhaps a little quieter
 than in the Central or Southern areas.
                                       
 Once you move away from the promenade 
 and the seafront, the area is very    
 much like any other small town,with a 
 pleasant residential area and a busy  
 shopping centre in the "village" of   
 Bispham.                              </content>
