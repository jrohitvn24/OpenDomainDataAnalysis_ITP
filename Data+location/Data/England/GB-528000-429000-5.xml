		<content> We went to Mrs.Priests house and she  
 told us about the weather.If the      
 weather is blowing from the North East
 it is cold.If the wind is blowing from
 the West it is damp.If it is blowing  
 from the South West it is warm.The    
 equipment Mrs.Priest uses is a        
 Stephen's Screen and it is a white box
 like a small beehive. But inside there
 are not bees there are temperatures.  
 She measures humidity and temperatures
 three times a week: Monday,Wednesday, 
 and Saturday.
