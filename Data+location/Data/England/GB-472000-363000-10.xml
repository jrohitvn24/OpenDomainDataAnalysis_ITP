		<title>10RELIGION IN OSSINGTON (3)</title>
		<content>    Perhaps the most important monument
 in Ossington Church is a{palimpsest   
{brass}commemorating Reynald Peckham   
 and his wife which lies on the south  
 side of the Sanctuary on an altar     
 tomb.{Palimpsest means that it is an  
{old brass which has been altered for a
{new memorial.}The effigies here have  
 been cut from a large{German or       
{Flemish brass}which was originally    
 made for a lady about{1360,}nearly 200
 years before.                         
    Over the altar is a{17th century   
{painting of Christ healing at the Pool
{of Siloam.}It was damaged by fire in  
 1974 but has since been restored.     
    There is a{War Memorial}on the     
 south side and close to the altar is a
 plaque from the{R.A.F.}who were       
 stationed here during{World War 2.
