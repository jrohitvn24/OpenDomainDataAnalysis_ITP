		<content>{Tresham.}A small village of about     
 three dozen houses, with a church,    
 telephone box, letter box in a wall   
 and a house which sells milk and soft 
 drinks. The village is on a hill with 
 a valley sloping away to the south-   
 west.                                 
{Wortley}is between Wotton-under-Edge  
 and Alderley. There are only about 16 
 houses. Most of the cottages are      
 detatched, one of them is thatched.   
 The houses are very old, some are over
 two hundred years old. There aren't   
 many children living in Wortley, it is
 a very quiet place. There is a place  
 there called Park Farm, it is being   
 rennovated because it is old and      
 falling apart. Wortley isn't a very   
 big place but a lovely view. It is a  
 hamlet because it does not have a     
 church. It has a telephone box and a  
 letter box in a wall.                 </content>
