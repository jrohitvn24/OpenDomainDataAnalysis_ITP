		<title>10The Windmill at Norwell</title>
		<content>    Norwell once had 3 mills, a        
 watermill, a windmill in North field  
 and the one still standing off Main   
 Street. Built in{1852}this mill worked
 until 1922, for the last 6 years      
 operating with 2 sails.               
   The machinery was all sold for scrap
 and the top 12 feet of brickwork      
 removed when a former owner wished to 
 convert the mill to a dwelling.       
 Planning permission was refused.      
   The{Gregory's}bought the shell of   
 the tower in{1977}and built a bungalow
 alongside the mill, hoping to restore 
 the mill to full working order.       
  {1985}saw the beginning of           
 restoration work with the rebuilding  
 and tarring of the tower. The next    
 step is to renew the beams and floor  
 before building a new cap. Hopefully  
 Norwell windmill will be grinding     
 flour again by{1992.                  </content>
