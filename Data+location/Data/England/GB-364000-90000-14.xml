		<content>}  Life on our estate is a close-knit  
 community. Faces are often familiar   
 and anyone is welcome. It is a small  
 and compact area, with efficient      
 shopping facilities and leisure       
 resources. The houses are made from   
 brick and cement, and a modern mixture
 of materials to use for a house. The  
 houses are usually three-bedroomed    
 with a front room, a kitchen and a    
 bathroom and some have dining rooms   
 downstairs. If you wish you can buy   
 your own house, and add an extension. 
 The roads are pretty scruffy, with    
 litter blowing down the street        
 gutters. The play-park is a mess, and 
 there is broken glass and coke cans   
 littering the floor. There are two    
 schools near the estate, one is mixed 
 and one is a girls school.
