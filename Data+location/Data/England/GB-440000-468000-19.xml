		<title>19GAMES IN THE VILLAGE</title>
		<content> On a night after school we go to play 
 down the Back Lane.  Down there is a  
 farm yard owned by Mr. Swiers who also
 owns many tractors.  The games we play
 are scramble, blocky and tig.   We    
 just start to play when the boss comes
 down in his Subaru 4WD.  He stops us  
 and kicks us out of the yard. Up near 
 the cricket field was a BMX course    
 which we made but now are not allowed 
 in. In the Main St. there is a village
 pump called The Fountain where we     
 sometimes play tig.  When it is hot   
 you cannot see because of the sun     
 shining straight at the fountain.  At 
 Peter Allan's it is good for playing  
 "Fox Off"when you find one group and  
 after you let them go you follow and  
 tig them.  We are not supposed to     
 play round the building site.  The    
 village lacks facilities for childre
