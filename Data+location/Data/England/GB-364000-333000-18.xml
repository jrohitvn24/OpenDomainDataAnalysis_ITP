		<title>18Older Buildings</title>
		<content> In the town there are examples from a 
 wide range of building periods.A great
 fire in 1651  destroyed most of the   
 early timber framed buildings, only   
 Freddies Restaurant in Shropshire St  
 and Westons Chip Shop in Stafford St  
 survived.After the fire further timber
 framed buildings were built,examples  
 include 3 pubs the Crown,the Vaults   
 and the Star.Cotton House in          
 Shropshire Street is a fine           
 example.Few bricks were used.These    
 were used in the foundation of the    
 timber framed walls and in the central
 chimney around which the rest of the  
 house was constructed.Bricks became   
 more widely used after 1700 and 41    
 Shropshire St is a fine example of the
 use of brick in that period.Good      
 examples of late Victorian peroid     
 can be found in the Burgage ,Longslow 
 Road, Clive Road and Victoria Road.   </content>
