		<title>07How Ryhope has Changed</title>
		<content>    The majority of people in our      
 survey felt that life was better when 
 they were younger. They felt people   
 were more friendly, that there was    
 less violence, and a lot of people    
 said they could leave their doors     
 unlocked and their houses would be    
 safe. Some people did say that things 
 were worse because people were poorer 
 in earlier days. Most people felt that
 the changes in{Ryhope}were fine. Some 
 people said they missed the pit and   
 the older type of houses.             
    Almost everyone looked back on     
 their{schooldays}with fondness even   
 though a lot of people spoke about how
 strict their{teachers}were. Most      
 people seemed to think that the only  
 difference between school when they   
 were young and{school}today was the   
 methods used by the teachers.
