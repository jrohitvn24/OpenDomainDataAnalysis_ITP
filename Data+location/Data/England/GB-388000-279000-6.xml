		<title>06HAS HAGLEY CHANGED?</title>
		<content>   Hagley today is on the very edge of 
 the West Midlands Conurbation. It is  
 separated on its northern and western 
 limits from Halesowen and Stourbridge,
 by ever-narrowing strips of open      
 country and farmland.                 
   Older residents note with some alarm
 the{growth in house building}in Hagley
 in the last 25 years. For example,    
 Middlefield Lane at the turn of the   
 century had only about 11-12 houses,  
 and{Hagley had few shops,}such as a   
 grocers, cobblers, bakers and         
 ironmonger. Each week, the main       
 village entertainment was a film show,
 run by{Mr Geoffrey Baker.}The nearest 
 doctor was at Clent, with a dispensary
 at Stourbridge.                       
   Now, West Hagley has many more shops
 and many feel that Hagley generally   
 has lost its old feeling of rural     
 isolation and{close community spirit. </content>
