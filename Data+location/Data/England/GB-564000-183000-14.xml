		<content>  The Horndon-on-the-Hill Society is an
 independent organisation, which anyone
 who has an interest in the Village,   
 may join.  Its purpose is to premote  
 the conservation and enhancement of   
 land and buildings in and around the  
 Village, wherever possible, for the   
 benefit of the Villagers and the      
 visitors.  The Society helps the      
 Village in two ways:-  by raising     
 money mostly from the Feast and Fair, 
 for particular enhancement schemes and
 by representations to the local       
 Authority and other relevant bodies   
 about things which can be done to help
 the Village retain or enhance its     
 special appearance, rural character   
 and community spirit.  It has been    
 engaged in many varied enhancement and
 protection projects in the Village.
