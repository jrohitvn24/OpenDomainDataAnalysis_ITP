		<title>20SWINFORD ADAPTS TO CHANGE</title>
		<content>{Swinford}is a good example of a small 
 rural community which is adapting to a
 change in the pattern of population as
 it becomes as much a dormitory as an  
 agricultural village. Families who    
 have moved to Swinford from distant   
 parts of the United Kingdom mix with  
 people who may be descendants of      
 inhabitants who lived here when the   
 first{Domesday Survey}was recorded.   
 The village school epitomises this    
 interdependance.{                     
{                                      
{As an example this survey is the      
{result of co-operation between the    
{children and staff of Swinford Church 
{of England School, their families and 
{friends.
