		<content>      London Regional Transport runs a 
 wide range of services.   You can     
 catch buses to Romford, Dagenham,     
 Barking and Ilford.   Out of 333      
 children we found 19 of their parents 
 used the bus to go to work, 60 to go  
 shopping and 29 of their brothers and 
 sisters used a bus to travel to their 
 Secondary School.                     
      There are 'Underground' stations 
 at Hornchurch and Upminster Bridge.   
 These trains run on the District Line 
 between Upminster and Central London. 
      British Rail operate a branch    
 line in our area.   The station is    
 called Emerson Park.   People can go  
 shopping in Romford or Upminster.     
 The line is most busy when it is used 
 by commuters.   In June 1985 the      
 trains were changed from deisel to    
 electric.   13 parents use it daily.  
 62 parents use it at least monthly.   </content>
