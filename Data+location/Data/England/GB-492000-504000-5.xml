		<content> Tourists come to Robin Hoods Bay from 
 big towns to get away from it all.    
 Maybe the name intrigues them and they
 think it has something to do with     
 Robin Hood the outlaw. Many tales are 
 told and explanations given but nobody
 knows for sure how the village got its
 name.                                 
 People come from all over the country.
 We have visitors from Middlesbrough,  
 Glasgow, Peebles and Darlington in the
 north, from Chesterfield, Canterbury, 
 London and York in the south, from    
 Liverpool and Leeds in the west and   
 from many other towns and villages all
 over the British Isles. We also have  
 visitors from abroad, both from Europe
 and America.                          
 We did a survey one weekend when we   
 asked the visitors seven questions.   
 98% said they would come again. We    
 were pleased that they liked it here. </content>
