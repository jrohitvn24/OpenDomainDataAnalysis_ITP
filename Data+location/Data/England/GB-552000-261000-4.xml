		<content>   Not so long ago Swaffham Bulbeck was
 a small village with clusters of      
 cottages around meadows and fields.   
 The houses were linked together by    
 dusty lanes.                          
  The village school was very          
 different. The children (girls and    
 boys) played separately. They also    
 hardly ever did anything outside.     
  No milkman came round then so the    
 villagers got their milk from a farm. 
 Sometimes they made butter with it.   
  People weren't usually born in       
 hospital but in their home.           
  More recently the old peoples homes  
 and Vicarage Close were built.Also to 
 the north, council houses were built. 
  About 40 years ago the pubs and shops
 started closing leaving about two of  
 each.Young couples with children moved
 in.These people mostly commute to work
 in Cambridge.                         </content>
