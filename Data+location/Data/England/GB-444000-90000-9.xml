		<title>09THE OLD CHURCH,PORCHFIELD</title>
		<content> Walking between the Inn and the Post  
 Office along the Porchfield Road,there
 is an old high stone wall surmounted  
 only by the leaves of trees,quite a   
 usual sight here,but there is         
 something more _ a green ivyed        
 archway,marking a break in the wall,  
 with old rusty gate and path narrowed 
 by branches and weeds.There is a clue 
 to this overgrown garden,a leaning    
 headstone.Through the gate more       
 gravestones appear,finally amongst the
 bushes rises an old church.Clearly    
 through the leaves the nailed door and
 boarded windows can be seen.It stands 
 with fallen slates,spireless and      
 unused.A small square of the graveyard
 has been cleared,here lie two graves  
 neatly tended with flowers, recent    
 among their forgotten companions.     
                                       
                                       </content>
