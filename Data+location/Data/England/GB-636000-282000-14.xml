    When I get up at 7 o' clock I get  
dressed and then have my breakfast     
which is usually Cornflakes. I see my  
Dad off to work and then feed my       
rabbits. Then I go indoors and play    
with my computer games.                
    My Mum drives me to school and we  
play for about 10 minutes in the       
playground. We come into school at     
8:50 a.m. and Mr Patrick collects our  
dinner money which costs 62p each day. 
    Our lessons in the morning are     
usually reading, number work, singing, 
swimming and some topic work. Playtime 
lasts for 15 minutes and lunch-time is 
at noon.In the afternoon we paint or do
needlework, sometimes games or P.E. and
listen to stories.                     
    When I get home I have tea, play   
outside, watch T.V. and go to bed at   
9 o' clock.                            </content>
