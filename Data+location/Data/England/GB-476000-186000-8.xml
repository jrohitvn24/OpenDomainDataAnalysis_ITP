		<content>The village church is the oldest       
village building with registers dating 
back to 1566.The oldest part of the    
existing church is the North Transept, 
some of which was built in the twelth  
century.In 1985,the members of the     
Parochial Church Council decided to re-
decorate the interior which was last   
done in 1968.The quotation for the work
was 11,172 pounds + V.A.T.Work         
commenced on 15th.April and was        
completed on 20th.June.The lime-wash   
which was applied did not adhere to the
existing surface and the walls had to  
be scraped at an extra cost of 1150    
pounds.Dry rot was discovered in the   
North Transept and Rentokil repaired   
the damage.This cost 4004 pounds.The   
altar frontal chest was also infected  
and will be replaced at a cost of 1000 
pounds.
