		<title>13A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> Our house is a 19th century shooting  
 lodge. It has got 11 bedrooms. We eat 
 in the kitchen except when we have    
 guests and then we eat in the dining  
 room. My mother has two women who help
 clean the house but in the past this  
 house had eleven indoor staff and     
 eight gardeners. Now we have three    
 days help in the garden each week. A  
 hundred years ago all the staff had to
 walk to the village church one and a  
 half miles away.                      
 The man who helps my father run the   
 farm lives in the farm house which is 
 called Sperry Barton. He and his wife 
 have five children who go to school   
 in Wiveliscombe by bus. The bus stops 
 at each farm and at the end of the day
 the chuldren are dropped off at the   
 end of the farm drive. They bike or   
 walk home which is about a quarter of 
 a mile.                               </content>
