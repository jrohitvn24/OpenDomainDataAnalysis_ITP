		<title>15HAZEL GROVE SPORTS CENTRE.</title>
		<content> It was built in 1977 and was          
 positioned near the school.  This     
 meant that facilities could be shared.
 It also meant that the school took    
 priority over the public.  In return, 
 the school allows the public to use   
 the school hall for judo and yoga     
 classes.  There are many courses held 
 in the centre.  The most popular is   
 gymnastics on Saturday mornings.      
 Martial Art courses are also popular  
 because of the influence of T.V. films
 and people's increasing desire to     
 learn self defence. There are         
 twenty-two employees in the centre who
 not only look after the indoor        
 facilities but also attend to the     
 outside tennis courts, and football   
 all-weather pitches. About 6,000      
 people use the centre every month,    
 some have become famous athletes.
