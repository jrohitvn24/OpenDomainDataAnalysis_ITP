		<title>13ASHPERTON - LAW AND ORDER</title>
		<content> There is a police house in the village
 which has been empty since the local  
 policeman bought a house in Ledbury   
 and moved there. It is planned to find
 another constable to occupy it. The   
 previous policeman and a woman police 
 constable respond to any calls from   
 this area. The policy is now to patrol
 in a police car stopping at sevaral   
 places so that they are seen in  a    
 wide area west of Ledbury. The main   
 need for police presence is at        
 accidents on busy crosssroads. There  
 are thefts of tools and electrical    
 equipment but few cases of burglaries.
 Although there have been groups of    
 thieves travelling into the area in   
 search of antiques and silverware. The
 police are also responsible for       
 moving travelling families off the    
 verges along the highways.
