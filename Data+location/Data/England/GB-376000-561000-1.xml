		<title>01HILLS SOUTH OF BARDON MILL</title>
		<content> This area os predominately farmland,  
 some arable near the River South Tyne,
 but mostly fell country used for sheep
 rearing. Some milk production. The    
 area also includes most of the        
 National Trust Allen Banks, deciduous 
 woodland area along River Allen, well 
 used by public. Willimoteswyke is a   
 14th century border castle, now a     
 farm. Bettingham, only a hamlet with  
 half a dozen houses, has been a place 
 of worship for more tham 1000 years.  
 Apart from Allen Banks are Ridley     
 Hall. The area is very remote and     
 undisturbed. Ridley Hall, a 19th      
 century mansion, is now used as a     
 loarding wing for a local state High  
 School. A playgroup and adult lectures
 are held here as it is the nearest    
 school centre for Bardon Mill.
