		<content>    This block for the Domesday        
 Project was compiled,researched and   
 written by the pupils in the first    
 year class of{Drayton Middle School   
 during the summer term,1985.The 31    
 children were aided and guided by{Mrs.
{Terry Blake,}their class teacher,and  
 by{Mr. Robert Blake,}a student at the 
 University of East Anglia on teaching 
 practice as part of the Post Graduate 
 Certificate in Education.Credit must  
 also be given to{Mr.Jan Tanner,}whose 
 familiarity with computers and cameras
 was invaluable.The children did much  
 of the basic research,particularly on 
 the land survey,while the typing was  
 performed by the staff.The project    
 proved to be rewarding and we all hope
 that what we have written is both     
 informative and interesting to all    
 those people who read it in the years 
 to come.                              </content>
