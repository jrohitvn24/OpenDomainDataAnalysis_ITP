		<title>15QUARRYING IN GRETTON</title>
		<content>                                       
   The limestone in and around Gretton 
contained iron ore, and evidence of    
quarrying and smelting goes back to    
Roman times. In 1910, blast furnaces   
were built in Corby. By 1931, there was
severe unemployment in Gretton, but in 
that year Stuart and LLoyds (later to  
become British Steel Corporation)      
opened the iron and steel tubeworks,   
again in Corby. This, together with the
need for houses as a result. wiped out 
the unemployment in the village. In    
the early 1980's the quarries closed,  
once again making many people          
unemployed. The railway lines which    
transported the ore to the ironworks   
were taken up. Most quarries were      
filled in and handed back to the       
farmers. Some were planted with trees  
and relandscaped, others have been left
and have water in the bottom.          </content>
