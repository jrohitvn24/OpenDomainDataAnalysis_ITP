		<content>   Mrs Fenwick's corner shop in Sugley 
 Street is about 100 years old.It sells
 bread;confectionery;pop;washing up    
 liquid and many other useful items    
 such as needles,thread,shoelaces,     
 and dummies.She gets her bread from   
 Mother's Pride Bakery in Westerhope   
 and other supplies from Wellworth     
 Cash and Carry in Newburn.The shop    
 opens at 8.45a.m.and closes at 7.00   
 p.m.on light summer nights.It is open 
 seven days a week.Mrs Fenwick knows   
 most customers by their Christian     
 names and often chats to them about   
 their problems and their families.    
 Her busiest time is lunchtime when    
 people buy pies and savoury           
 sandwiches.She has a microwave oven   
 to heat up pies.She even makes fresh  
 sandwiches while you wait.Sunday is   
 her busiest day,as people buy things  
 they have forgotten during the week.  </content>
