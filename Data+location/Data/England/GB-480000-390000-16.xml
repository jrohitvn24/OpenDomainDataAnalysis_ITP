		<content>   My Mum gets up at the same time as  
 I.She gets our lunches while I get the
 breakfast.When we go to school she    
 watches breakfast television,then she 
 takes the dog for a walk.When she gets
 back she does the housework,such as   
 hoovering,washing-up and making       
 beds.At 11.30am she starts making the 
 dinner for when Dad comes home at     
 12.00.On Tuesdays she goes to         
 Scunthorpe and the Asda supermarket   
 and we pick her up at 4.30pm to go    
 home.On other days she does more      
 housework.Later in the afternoon she  
 watches the television.When Dad brings
 us home she makes tea.Afterwards she  
 comes to play cricket or football with
 us.Then we watch television until we  
 go to bed.
