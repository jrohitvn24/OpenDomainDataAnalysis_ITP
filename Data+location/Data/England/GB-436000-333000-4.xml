    When we examined the map we        
 discovered there are two large playing
 field areas and a park which has      
 tennis courts,putting and bowling     
 greens and football facilities.       
    The playing fields near school are 
 used by the children when at school   
 for football,rounders and their own   
 adventure playing.It is also quite a  
 good bird watching area.              
    The only indoor sports facilities  
 are at the YMCA and may only be used  
 if one is a member of their           
 organisation.Various activities are   
 arranged for youngsters.              
    The children feel there is a great 
 need for more indoor recreation       
 although they appreciate that their   
 immediate area is mainly industrial.
