		<content>  {Rowlands Castle,}a suburban         
 dormitory village occupies three of   
 the north western blocks.             
   The northern fringe of{Westbourne}is
 included in the south eastern square. 
   The South western square is almost  
 entirely filled by a portion of the   
 large Leigh Park Housing estate       
 known as{Sharp's Copse.}              
   The seven remaining squares are     
 rural and are almost evenly divided   
 between woodland and grassland which  
 is used for{dairy farming.}           
   The land is gently undulating and   
 the{soils}vary from upper chalk       
 to Reading beds and London clay       
 from North to South.
