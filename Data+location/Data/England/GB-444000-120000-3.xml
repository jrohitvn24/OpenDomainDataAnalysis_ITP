		<title>03CHANDLER'S FORD LIBRARY</title>
		<content>      This public library was opened in
 1983.It differs from a library built  
 ten years ago as it is a{horseshoe    
  {shape}instead of rectangular. Inside
 it is light and airy. The paint work  
 is red. A spiral staircase leads from 
 the ground floor to the second storey 
 which is like an open balcony,        
 extending over half the ground floor  
 area. The library is carpeted         
 throughout. The innerside of the      
 horseshoe is all glass and the windows
 are in an arch shape. There are       
 display boards on the ground floor    
 where societies and clubs may         
 advertise events.                     
     The{library opens}at 10 00 daily  
 and closes at 19 00 except for Mondays
 when it shuts at 17 00 and Wednesdays 
 and Sundays when it is closed all day.
    {Librarians} are on duty whenever  
 the library is open, and also all day </content>
