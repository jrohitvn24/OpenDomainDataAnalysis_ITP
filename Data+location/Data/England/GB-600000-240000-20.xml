		<title>20Summary(Contd.):Hadleigh</title>
		<content>Some of the material entered is very   
unrepresentative - most classes would  
not have as many fish,for example,and  
certainly not as many frogs! The food  
section was difficult to arrange as    
many children simply put sandwiches for
lunch and chips for dinner. Convenience
or "junk" food reigned supreme.The one 
example included is more interesting   
but certainly not representative.      
On the other hand it seems that many   
people do spend all their spare time   
watching television.                   
This is not a complete picture of      
Hadleigh as our block does not include 
the main industrial areas.Although the 
block is mainly farmland our children  
are not country children,and have      
little contact with the farms.
