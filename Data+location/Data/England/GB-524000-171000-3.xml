		<title>03Wimbledon Park:a suburb</title>
		<content>The suberb around Wimbledon Park is    
partly in the borough of Merton and    
partly in Wandworth.It has as its      
centre a quiet shopping street which   
supplies all the everyday needs of the 
lacal people.There are no buses except 
along the main road at the foot of the 
hill so the Tube station is very busy  
with commuters and schoolchildren in   
the morning and again in the evening.  
There are new offices near the station 
for solicitors, estate agents,         
accountants, insurance brokers and one 
is a shipping office. On either side,  
there are long narrow strrets of       
terraced houses built in the late 19th 
century. Few houses have front gardens.
Parked cars are everywhere. Higher in  
the hill,near the Park, there are newer
detached houses with lovely gardens.
