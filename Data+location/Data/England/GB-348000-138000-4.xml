		<title>04Unemployment in Glastonbury</title>
		<content> In the past few months there has been 
 increasing outbreaks of{vandalism}in  
 Glastonbury.  Although these have by  
 no means reached serious proportions, 
 the incidents worry the townspeople.  
 Situated as it is in the centre of    
 rural farmland Glastonbury seems an   
 unlikely place to find the hooliganism
 which is affecting other more urban   
 areas of English society.  The blame  
 appears to lie with{boredom and       
{unemployment. }Two major local        
 industries have closed down recently. 
{Morlands,a sheepskin factory          
 specialising in the production of     
 quality leather goods was forced out  
 of production. {Snows, a local fuel   
 and{timber merchant,}has also just    
 closed.  The firm's bankruptcy has    
 thrown on to the open market many     
 young people who will find it         
 difficult to find new employment.     </content>
