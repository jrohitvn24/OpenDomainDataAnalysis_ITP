		<title>16FARMING</title>
		<content>   One farmer grows{soft fruit} on some
 of his land. He has an extensive      
 acreage, most of which lies outside   
 this block. However, in{Bleasby Moor} 
 he has several small fields of awkward
 shapes and sizes. He grows a variety  
 of fruit, including strawberries,     
 raspberries,red-currants,             
 black-currants, gooseberries,         
 cultivated blackberries and           
 tayberries.                           
   Because of the price of labour, the 
 fruit is picked on a do-it-yourself   
 basis, but other seasonal jobs, such  
 as pruning and weeding, are done by   
 the farm labour.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
