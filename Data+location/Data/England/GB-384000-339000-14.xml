		<title>14Hanchurch Village</title>
		<content>Mentioned in the Domesday Book         
Hanchurch  Village still stands on the 
same site to the west of               
Stoke-on-Trent. Comprising of around   
forty houses it was,until the 1950's   
mainly inhabited by the labourers.     
Since then the population has altered  
considerably with some of the farm     
cottages being demolished and replaced 
by modern houses. The oldest building  
may possibly date back to the          
fourteenth century being of cruck      
construction and having seventeenth    
century stone and brick extentions.    
There is also a seventeenth century    
farm at the crossroads. Other          
buildings constructed since include a  
farmer coaching inn and a chapel which 
is a converted cow shed. On the hill   
overlooking the village stands a       
circle of yew trees at least 900 years 
old.                                   </content>
