		<title>01Lundy-the central section.</title>
		<content> Lundy falls into 3 D blocks.For       
 reasons of convenience and space all  
 those things that relate to the       
 ecology of the island are dealt with  
 in the north-as are the children's    
 experiences.Likewise the history and  
 details of tourism are dealt with in  
 the south.The main settlement lies in 
 this section.                         
 The island lies 11 miles off the North
 Devon coast.It is owned by the        
 National Trust and run by the Landmark
 Trust.It has a small resident         
 population and its main industry is   
 tourism-with some farming.The island  
 has a supply ship and a weekly        
 helicopter service.                   
 Although only 3 miles long and about  
 half a mile wide there is a wealth of 
 interest,historical and ecological.The
 scenery is magnificent and the peace  
 almost total.                         </content>
