		<content> The senior school is called Ridgeway, 
 it replaced a grammar school at       
 Marlborough and another school at     
 Burderop.                             
    The school is 18 years old and was 
 founded in 1967.                      
    About 38 percent of the pupils who 
 start in the first year leave school  
 in the upper sixth form. Out of all   
 the pupils at Ridgeway 16% go to      
 college, 25% find jobs, 13% go on the 
 YTS and 8% are unknown. 62% of the    
 pupils who start in the first year    
 leave school in the fifth year. The   
 school has about 69 staff.            
    The majority of the pupils come to 
 school by bus as they live in outlying
 villages.
