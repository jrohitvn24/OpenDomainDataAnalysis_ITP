		<title>18COMMUTER VIEW OF COPFORD</title>
		<content>{ Copford}is not one of the most       
 attractive of our Essex villages nor  
 is it exactly a composite one. It     
 has that rather straggly but kempt    
 appearance which to the fleeting      
 visitor is not always readily         
 discernable. It divides into three    
 main catchment areas. Busy London Road
 with its through traffic and          
 "Windmill" nightspot; School Road     
 aptly named leading us past the       
 recently erected Village sign to the  
 Green, the quieter corner which       
 includes our village 'local', The     
 Alma, a bustling country hostelry     
 beside the Green overlooking the old  
 dutch barn and village pond, is       
 perhaps the only{refuge}apart from our
 Church and Primary school where all   
 three communities unite.
