		<title>07Carlisle Great Fair (i)</title>
		<content> This was revived in the 1970's mainly 
 to encourage tourism but also to give 
 a focus to the activities of local    
 societies.It is organised by a comm-  
 ittee of unpaid enthusiasts.          
 The first Great Fair was granted in a 
 charter of Edward III in 1352; it is  
 proclaimed by the Chief Executive     
 (formerly the Town Clerk) from the    
 steps of Carlisle Cross at 8.00a.m. on
 26 August in a civic ceremony.        
 The most visible parts of the Fair are
 the open-air street market, with stall
 holders in approximately Victorian    
 costume; live entertainment on the    
 temporary stage outside the Old Town  
 Hall (with traffic diverted); and a   
 parade of decorated floats on the     
 Saturday afternoon.                   
 In the evenings local societies and   
 professional promotions compete for an
 audience.             {(see p.8) >>}  </content>
