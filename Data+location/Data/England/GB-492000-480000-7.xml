		<title>07WALK IN WYDALE, SNAINTON</title>
		<content> It was a lovely spring morning.The    
 first tree we see was an oak which had
 a yellow honey fungus on it and around
 the fungus the branches were dead. The
 oak has distinctive wobbly-like       
 leaves.                               
                Then Andrew spotted a  
 thistle covered with cuckoo spit with 
 a tiny frog hopper in the spit. The   
 first flower we found was a bird's    
 foot trefoil_it has over 70 names     
 including 'bacon and eggs'! I picked  
 some dog and briar roses; dog roses   
 are whitey pink and briar roses pinky 
 red.                                  
       At the end of the path was the  
 quarry and then the Beech wood.We     
 walked on the beech mast,when that    
 rots it leaves an acidy soil that most
 plants and trees don't like, nettles  
 grow, but not very well.We saw an elm 
 with Dutch Elm disease.               </content>
