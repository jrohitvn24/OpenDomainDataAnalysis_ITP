		<title>18Ainsdale dune life</title>
		<content>    In a{dune slack}we found brookweed,
 creeping willow, pennywort, early     
 marsh orchid and marsh marigold. The  
 dune helleborine grows here. Sea      
 milkwort, a small pink plant, spreads 
 a thick mat in sand. There was some   
 "cuckoo spit" with a 1mm long frog-   
 hopper inside. Most plants cannot     
 survive as salt prevents their roots  
 from absorbing water. In a pond we    
 found a dull black, worm-like leech.  
 Moving, it was 10cm when extended but 
 5cm when contracted. We put a dead    
 frog in the pond for the rare natter- 
 jack tadpoles to eat. They were 2cm   
 long and had not yet developed legs.  
    In{dune heath}you have to dodge    
 prickly yellow-flowered gorse and     
 purple heather tickles your legs. It  
 is common to see a rabbit, its long   
 ears sticking up, scampering in the   
 dune grass.                           </content>
