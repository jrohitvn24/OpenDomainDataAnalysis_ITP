		<title>12St.Mary's Church,Lydden</title>
		<content>Lydden church is part of a united      
benefice with Temple Ewell.It operates 
independently with its own Parochial   
Church Council and runs its own church 
and events.There is some co-operation  
with Temple Ewell and people from      
Temple Ewell help by conducting        
worship.The congregation is            
particularly faithful and loyal.From an
Electoral Roll of 17 we have a         
congregation of about 14.They look     
after the church building exceptionally
well.Christmas,Easter,Patronal Festival
and Harvest are marked with an extra   
service in the afternoon or evening in 
addition to our normal Communion       
Service in the morning.We run a Harvest
Supper supported by the villagers.We   
have a Cheese and Wine Party,Bring and 
Buy and Christmas Bazaar each year.    
During Lent we have a small group      
following the Radio Kent Lent course.  </content>
