		<content> The{Acland_Hood ancestry}stretches    
 back to the times of Henry I. They    
 have been living at{Wootton House,}   
 in Butleigh Wootton, since 1649. The  
 house was built by the Hoods'         
 ancestors and they moved into it as   
 soon as it was finished. It has been  
 expanded and parts of it knocked down 
 since then. The main house is still   
 Jacobite, but the wings are Regency.  
{The gardens}are now open to the       
 public. The Acland_Hoods are the main 
 landowners in this area, owning 1000  
 acres. They own land around Street,   
 Glastonbury and on Sedgemoor. Most of 
 the land is rented out, being used    
 mostly for mixed farming.{Butleigh    
{Monument}was built by the officers of 
 Admiral Samuel Hood in 1830, on his   
 command. The name originates from     
 Admiral Alexander Hood marrying Miss  
 Acland.                               </content>
