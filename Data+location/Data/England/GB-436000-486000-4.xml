		<title>04Beal House Farm.</title>
		<content>{Mr. Alderson's Farm                   
  To the East of Mr. Bell's farm was   
  Beal house Farm. This farmhouse is   
  different to most of the farmhouses  
 in our area because it is a high      
 building built on a hill.             
 We have read that the word "Beal"     
 comes from "Baal" and that maybe along
 time ago, people worshipped the god   
 Baal on the hill where the farmhouse  
 is .                                  
  To_day the farmer has about 200      
 acres,130 acres is used for crops ,60 
 acres is used for grass and there are 
 about 7 acres of woodland. Most of the
 woodland is sycamore trees and the    
 farmer cuts trees down to make a right
 of way.                               
 This farmer is planting half a mile of
 new hedging. A few years ago  he      
 pulled the hedge out and put fencing  
 in but now he is putting it back.     </content>
