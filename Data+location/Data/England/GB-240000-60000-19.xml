		<content> Means of transport in our block are   
 virtually nil. There are no trains,   
 few buses and one taxi service.       
 Residents rely almost entirely on     
 private vehicles. There are excellent 
 mooring facilities in the River Tamar 
 by Cargreen. The block is transversed 
 by one B road (Saltash/Callington),   
 and many narrow, high-hedged, metalled
 country roads. The nearest airport is 
 at Plymouth and operates a fleet of   
 small aircraft to several mainland    
 airfields as well as the Channel Isles
 and Ireland. The nearest ferryport is 
 also at Plymouth operated by Brittany 
 Ferries to Roscoff, France and        
 Santander, Spain.
