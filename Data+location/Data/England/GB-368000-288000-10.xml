		<title>10GLAZELEY CHURCH.</title>
		<content>}The church is about{3.5}miles from    
 Bridgnorth, and was rebuilt in 1875 to
 replace a much older building.        
    There are two beautiful{brasses}in 
 the church which are over 450 years   
 old.In the graveyard there is a       
 monument  for local people killed in  
 the{first World War.}The vicar is{Rev.
{Davies}who also is vicar of several   
 other local Parishes, such as Chetton.
  The brasses are of Thomas Wilde &amp;    
 his wife who were{killed}by their son.
 Their relatives laid the brasses  in  
 their memory in 1599.                 
    The nearby{altar}is made of marble 
 with a green beize cloth laid over it.
    In the{graveyard}there are some odd
 gravestones.One is a triangular shape 
 with a cross on the top.
