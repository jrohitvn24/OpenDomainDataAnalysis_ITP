		<content>     The area with which we are        
 concerned comprises part of the new   
 town of{Newton Aycliffe} and the      
 village of{Middridge}and the hamlet of
{Old Eldon.}The part of{Newton Aycliffe
 consists of mainly local authority    
 built housing although much private   
 housing development is taking place in
 the{Woodham}area which was once the   
 site of a mediaeval village.          
    {Woodham Burn}is a small stream    
 running from the south-west in a      
 north-easterly direction and is a     
 tributary of the{River Skerne.}       
    {Middridge}is a small village      
 consisting of private housing. Many of
 the houses are of the large detatched 
 executive type. The surrounding area  
 is largely agricultural land.
