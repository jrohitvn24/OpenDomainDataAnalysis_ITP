		<content>Moulton,Gazeley and Kentford are the   
three villages in this area. Gazeley   
is the highest point at 79metres,      
Moulton at 46metres and then Kentford  
at 30 metres.  Kentford is on the      
border between Suffolk and Cambridge-  
shire. In about l970 there was a flood 
on the boundary in Kentford which is   
on the B 1506.  Two roads leading away 
from the B 1506 go to Gazeley and      
Moulton. The boundary in Kentford      
swings off at a right angle across a   
field.  The only markers for the       
boundary were three dead trees.  We    
planted some new trees on the boundary 
at the owners suggestion.              
Kentford and the A45 mark a change in  
the landscape from the flatness of the 
fens to the north, and the undulating  
countryside to the south which is      
broken only by the valley of the River 
Kennett.                               </content>
