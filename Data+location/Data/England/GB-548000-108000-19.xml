		<title>19Trade in Ripe.</title>
		<content>      There are two shops and a public 
 house in the area. Ripe Stores and    
 Post Office sells groceries,          
 greengroceries, chemists goods and a  
 little selection of hardware, sweets  
 and off-licence goods. It is also the 
 local sub-Post Office. The Post Office
 is well patronised, being more        
 friendly and convenient than a large  
 Main Office and also much quicker. The
 couple who run the shop are John and  
 Jean Sanderson and they try to cater  
 for every taste. If you really want   
 something that is not on the shelves, 
 they will be only too happy to get it 
 on their next visit to the            
 wholesaler.The Post Office is a great 
 asset to the village. Pensions and    
 Childrens Allowances are paid out and 
 dog licenses, Television Licences and 
 postage stamps are sold. The National 
 Girobank is widely used in Ripe.      </content>
