		<title>17THE MAYORAL PROCESSION</title>
		<content> On several Sundays in the year, the   
{Mayor and members of Council}attend   
 morning service at All Saints Parish  
 Church. This happens on Remembrance   
 Sunday, after they have paraded along 
 the High Street. The{procession}is    
 very colourful and dates back to 16th 
 century. They used to walk in this    
 order.{The Beadle}with the the        
 staff leads followed with two{Bailiffs
 with white staves. Then came the      
{sergeant at-mace,}carrying a large    
 silver mace gilded with gold. Next    
 came the{Mayor,}carrying a silver mace
 gilded with gold, followed by the{High
{Steward}and recorder and, at the rear 
 in twos the{Aldermen}in the order of  
 service time. Finally, came the{Town  
{Clerk}and the{Burgesses}in twos. The  
 procession has changed a little over  
 the years.
