		<title>19A Child's Day in Kirtlington</title>
		<content>I get up at 7.00 a.m. and have         
breakfast of cereal and fruit juice. I 
get to school to start work at         
9 o'clock. Morning break is from       
10.40 a.m. to 10.55 a.m.. Lunch        
(e.g. chicken pie followed by jam and  
cream buns) is at 12 noon and costs 65 
pence. School starts again at 1.15 p.m.
and finishes at 3.25 p.m.. We take     
part in Assembly and News and Views.   
We work at projects, Language and      
Mathematics with help from the         
computer. We may watch a video or do   
movement with taped music, or games    
outside. At 3.00 p.m. we have our      
story before going home. I have a      
snack and then I go out to play.       
Sometimes I miss television! After     
supper I get ready for bed. I read to  
myself and then fall asleep. I am 5    
years old and this is my life style.
