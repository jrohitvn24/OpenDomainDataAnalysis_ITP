		<content> The main crop is{grass}.Sown fields   
 are sprayed to reduce weeds and       
 fertilizers are added to improve      
 growth.{Silage}is made by cutting     
 the grass,allowing it to wilt for a   
 time and then stacking it  with added 
 minerals and sometimes mollasses in a 
 silage clamp.The grass ferments to    
 produce a strong smelling substance   
 which is much loved by cattle.        
{Hay,}which once far outweighed silage 
 ,needs better weather as it has to be 
 thoroughly dried before baling.Round  
 bales are becoming more popular but   
 most farmers still make the           
 traditional oblong variety.           
  The commonest{cereal}crop is{barley} 
 but lately more farmers have been     
 putting fields down to{oil seed rape. 
 This plant is well known for turning  
 the fields bright yellow at flowering 
 time and is harvested by combining.   </content>
