		<content>  Every year around the beginning of   
 July the Seamer Fair takes place.This 
 coincides with the reading of the     
 Charter.It has taken place since 1383.
 It used to be the most important event
 in the area.Because the fair was so   
 important the Burgesses of Scarborough
 supressed it in 1612.It was revived   
 again in 1813,1814 &amp; 1815 and shows   
 were held in the village for horses,  
 cattle and sheep.By the year 1850 it  
 had been restricted to a two day event
 just to sell horses.To add excitement 
 the Gypsies started to attend.But     
 unfortunately in 1911 they caused a   
 disturbance.After this they only went 
 to Seamer on fair days.Soon after the 
 fair became a time of fun and sport.  
 The Charter is read at 11am on Saint  
 Swithens Day &amp; people still gather by 
 the old Toll House &amp; children run for 
 pennies thrown by the Lord of Seamer. </content>
