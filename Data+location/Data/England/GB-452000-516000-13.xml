		<content> There are quite alot of problems in { 
{Ormesby,}mainly vandalism, glue       
 sniffing and break ins. Our school has
 been broken into many times and the   
 windows are often broken. People who  
 break into our school don't usually   
 take anything, but just leave a mess. 
 Our school had a pond but someone kept
 vandqlising it so we filled it in.    
  There are many telephone boxes       
 vandalised around the area and a lot  
 of them are not fit to use.           
  Some shops where I live have been    
 broken into recently and there were   
 lots of things taken.                 
  There is a lot of glue sniffing in   
 Ormesby, mainly near Church Lane. Our 
 class saw some glue sniffers going    
 across our field. People sniff glue   
 for a dare and then get addicted.
