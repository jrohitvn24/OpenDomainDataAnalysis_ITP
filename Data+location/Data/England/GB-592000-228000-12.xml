		<title>12Fordham Parish Council</title>
		<content> At the top is the Government. Then    
 the County Council, Borough Council,  
 and finally the Parish Council. The   
 Parish Council looks after{local      
{affairs.}Fordham council has seven    
 members. These were elected. The      
 council has a{budget}each year, and   
 the members decide how to spend the   
 money, which they get from an extra   
 rate they add to the ordinary rates.  
 Each year they donate two hundred     
 pounds to help care for the church    
 yard. They also have to spend a lot of
 money repairing damage done by        
{vandals,}so money can't be spent      
 on providing extras for the village.  
 They own the{bus shelter}and the      
{playing field}on behalf of the        
 village. The playing field was given  
 as a gift to the village, and it would
 have cost eight thousand pounds to    
 buy.                                  </content>
