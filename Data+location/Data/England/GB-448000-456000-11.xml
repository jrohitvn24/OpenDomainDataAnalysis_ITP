 IN NUMBER SINCE THE 1891 CENSUS THOUGH
 CHANGE IN TYPE AND AGE GROUPS. THEN

 WHERE, 60 LEAVE THE VILLAGE TO WORK   
 MAINLY IN PROFESSIONS AND BUSINESS, 20
 CHILDREN ATTEND PRIMARY SCHOOL, 15    
 SECONDARY SCHOOL AND 36 PEOPLE ARE    
 RETIRED. THERE ARE NO ETHNIC MINORITY 
 FAMILIES. FIVE FAMILIES ARE           
 INDIGENOUS. ALL SPEAK STANDARD ENGLISH
 WITH SLIGHT LOCAL ACCENT BUT NO MARKED
 DIALECT. THERE IS LITTLE NEED FOR A   
 POLICE PRESENCE EXCEPT WHEN OUTSIDE   
 ELEMENTS ENTER. THE POST OFFICE HAS   
 BEEN THE TARGET AND ON 24.8.85. AT A  
 RACING EVENT A FATAL ACCIDENT TO A    
 YOUTH CREATED AN INCIDENT REQUIRING   
 POLICE REINFORCEMENT.                 </content>
