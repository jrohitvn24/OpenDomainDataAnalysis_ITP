		<content> Mossey Green is unused land. The      
 landscape is grass, weeds and gorse   
 bushes. There is a mobile home park   
 here.                                 
 Forge Hill is by the Forge            
 Interchange. There are many trees,    
 lots of clover and skylarks here.     
 From this hill can be seen many new   
 roads. The M54 is the most important. 
 Forge Junction joins the M54 from the 
 Wellington by-pass. The main          
 structure here is a large reinforced  
 concrete over-bridge which spans a    
 fault in the ground. This is known as 
 the Lightmoor Fault. The bridge took  
 16 hours to complete having required a
 continuous pour of 900 cubic metres of
 concrete.                             
 The Rock is so called because it      
 stands on stone. Most houses are      
 council owned. The open land is mostly
 rough grazing.                        </content>
