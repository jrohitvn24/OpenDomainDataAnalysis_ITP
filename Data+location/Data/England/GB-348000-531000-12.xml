		<title>12POWER LINES IN N.W.PENRITH</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
 Our geographical position to the      
 North of Shap Fell,with its sometimes 
 inhospitable weather &amp; difficult      
 terrain, has meant that Road &amp; Rail   
 communications have had to run through
 a narrow corridor right across the    
 North-West Penrith area.              
 Similar constraints,and the necessity 
 for continuity of supply in all       
 weathers,affected the way in which the
 Electricity Supply network was        
 planned, and although we have no Power
 Stations anywhere near us, our area   
 has both 275kV &amp; 132kV Overhead Power 
 Lines running through it(as well as   
 the more usual 33kV) which are major  
 arteries of the National Grid.
