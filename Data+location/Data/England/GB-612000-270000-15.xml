		<title>15Children's Playground Games</title>
		<content>Childrens play today has not changed   
much.Some of the old games are still   
played in the playground.Football,     
skipping and hopscotch are some of the 
popular games played.Things have       
changed in the way we play games.Now   
adays the boys play Crab football.They 
go around on their hands and feet to   
get the ball and they must not get     
up.(it is very hard.)When the boys     
play proper football they make a goal  
at each end of the playground.They     
don't usually split up into teams,Ian  
and Tony play the rest,as they are the 
best.Skipping is a very old game and   
played mostly by girls but some boys   
join in.Skipping has only changed by   
what we chant,here is a rhyme.Into the 
rope,And out of the rope,And into the  
rope again,Up to the sky,Ever so       
high,And down to the ground again.Many 
of the old rhymes are still used today.</content>
