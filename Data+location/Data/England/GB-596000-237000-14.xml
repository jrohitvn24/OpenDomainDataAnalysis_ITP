  THE POLSTEAD FAYRE committee,once    
known as the CARE AND SHARE            
CLUB,exists to help organisations in   
the village.The Fayre is now an annual 
event on the Old Rectory meadow.The    
many clubs and fund raising            
organisations in the village run stalls
and sideshows.One year people were     
able to follow the band of the Welsh   
Guards from the village green to the   
Fayre.The author John Rowe is keen to  
maintain the entertainment             
participation,and has encouraged the   
local children to join in performing   
verses about Polstead written as part  
of their school work.There had been a  
traditional fair on the village green  
which was revived in the 1950's but    
the venue has now changed.
