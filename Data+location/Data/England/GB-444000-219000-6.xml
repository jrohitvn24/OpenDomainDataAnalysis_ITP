		<title>06BOYS' GAMES</title>
		<content> These are some of the games boys play 
 in Tackley:{football, baseball,       
{cricket, rounders, American football, 
{snooker, forty-forty.                 
 When you play{'Forty-forty'}you have  
 to hide and the person who is 'he' has
 to try and find you.  If he sees you  
 he has to touch the can and say: "I   
 see.."(who-ever it is) and where they 
 are.                                  
 In{American Football}you start with a 
 'touch-down' and you have to run      
 through the post.  If you are fouled  
 you take a kick and try to get the    
 ball over the top of the post.  If you
 do you get 3 points.   You have 13    
 people in each team; 10 on the line, 2
 defenders and a quarter-back.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
