		<title>10TOURISM IN MARSDEN</title>
		<content>{                                      
 We are getting more tourists in       
 Marsden than we used to. They come    
 to see the canal and how the work is  
 going on to make it fit for boats.    
 The nicest parts of Marsden are       
 Mellor's bridgr,the pack horse bridge 
 by the vicarage, and Easter           
 Gate,named after Esther who had an inn
 there.There is also a nice park in    
 Marsden with a bowling green, a       
 bandstand,and a tennis court. There   
 is a small park at Rose Hill.There is 
 a restaurant at Hey Green,and two     
 cafes in the village.Sometimes walkers
 come to stay at the guest house by    
 the Grey Cat on Brougham Road.
