		<content> Astronomy is my best hobby.I have got 
 a telescope 200*50mm.I have got 8     
 books on it.When it gets dark in the  
 winter I go outside and set my        
 telescope up.I have got a 200* lens,  
 a                                     
 50* lens and a barrel lens.Sometimes I
 see the moon through it and I saw     
 Saturn's Rings as well and all the    
 constellations.Once I saw a programme 
 on T.V. about astronomy by Patrick    
 Moore and he told you all about       
 Hailey's Comet. It is coming in       
 1986.Its                              
 orbit is 76 years and was last seen in
 1910.One night I went to bed at 6.00  
 o'clock because I got up at 2.00      
 o'clock(in the morning) and set up my 
 telescope .I looked at the full moon. 
 You could see most of the craters on  
 it.                                   
                                       </content>
