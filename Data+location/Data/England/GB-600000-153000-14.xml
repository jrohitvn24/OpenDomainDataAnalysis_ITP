		<content> There are no schools in the area.     
 Children of primary school age travel 
 to Selling or Faversham but mainly to 
 Sheldwich County Primary School (with 
 provision for l2O children).  A nearby
 primary school (26 pupils) was closed 
 in July l985 and closure threatens all
 rural schools with a roll of less than
 6O.  Selection tests at age ll are    
 still carried out in the Kent         
 Education area;  the nearest secondary
 schools are at Ashford and Faversham. 
 Free transport (taxi, mini-bus) is    
 provided by the Education Authorities 
 for children under age 8 living over 2
 miles from school, and for those over 
 8 over 3 miles from school.           
 There are sufficient private schools  
 within a 3O mile radius to cope with  
 the increasing demand.
