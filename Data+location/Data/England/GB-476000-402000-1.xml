		<title>01Epworth. A Brief Description</title>
		<content>    Epworth is quite a large village in
{Humberside}situated between the towns 
 of{Scunthorpe}and{Doncaster.}The      
 population is approximately{3,100.    
   {The Market Place}is central to the 
 village and nearly all the shops are  
 situated here. The area is within five
 minutes walk for the majority of the  
 town's residents though those living  
 along{West End Rd, The Turbary,}and a 
 few other outlying areas face a       
 journey of up to 2 or 3 miles.        
    Epworth is an expanding town and   
 three new housing estates have        
 recently been built. A further estate 
 is presently under construction and   
 other development is planned.         
    Although only a small town, Epworth
 can boast its own Police, Ambulance-  
 and Fire stations.
