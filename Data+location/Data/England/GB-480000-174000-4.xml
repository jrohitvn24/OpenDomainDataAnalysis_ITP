		<content>  {Saint Lawrence's Church}is in the   
 middle of Waltham St Lawrence.  It is 
 a very old church which was mentioned 
 in the{Domesday Book}.                
                                       
   The church was built with {flint,   
{stone and brick}.  It has a tower at  
 the west end which has a clock on it. 
 There are bells in the tower which are
 rung for services and on special      
 occasions like weddings.              
                                       
   At the entrance to the church yard  
 there is a large {Yew tree}and a lych 
 gate.  The{Lych Gate}is a roofed      
 gate where the coffin and its bearers 
 could wait for the arrival of the     
 clergyman for a funeral.              
                                       
 Outside the church is the{pound}which 
 was used to keep stray animals.  There
 are four ash trees in the pound.      </content>
