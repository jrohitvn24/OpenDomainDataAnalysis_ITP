		<title>15VILLAGE PATCHWORK QUILT</title>
		<content> The ancient art of patchwork as a     
 corporate activity has been contiued  
 this year (1985) as ladies of the     
 village have completed a patchwork    
 quilt based on a four by four patch   
 mounted in a strip pattern.           
 The quilt has been made in a          
 traditional design, both hand and     
 machine sewn,and then totally hand    
 quilted.                              
  It will be raffled for Church funds. 
                                       
     A national Patchwork Guild and an 
 Embroiderers Guild exist to further   
 both design and needdlework skills.
