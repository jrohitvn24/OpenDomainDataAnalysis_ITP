		<title>12LUTWYCHE HALL, SHROPSHIRE</title>
		<content>    Lutwyche Hall,built in the 16th    
 century,is now in the process of being
 lovingly restored to much nearer its  
 former glory than has been its luck   
 for many a year. Roofs have been      
 renewed or repaired,floorboards lifted
 and underlying timbers renewed if     
 necessary and everything duly treated.
 Plumbing and electricity have been    
 attended to,and a flat made for a     
 caretaker and wife,who have been in   
 residence this year. Some of the      
 special trees such as cedars and a    
 very old lime have been pruned and    
 undergrowth cleared - yew bushes      
 trimmed back into shape - and         
 generally a good start to the outward 
 appearance of the grounds. Work in the
 house is to continue and the owner    
 hopes that 1986 will see the happy    
 outcome of its completion,ready to be 
 lived in again.                       </content>
