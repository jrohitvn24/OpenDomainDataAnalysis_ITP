		<content>   Education in Cherry Willingam and   
 Reepham comprises of a Comprehensive  
 school with 480 pupils in it and it is
 fed by schools from within and outside
 our block. Within the block there is a
 school at Reepham which has about 100 
 pupils from 5yrs to 11yrs. The school 
 is old (built about 1890) and has some
 temporary buildings. Cherry Willingham
 has two other schools; an infant and a
 junior school.The two schools have    
 about 180 pupils.                     
   A major problem for this area is    
 that the population has dropped a lot 
 over the last few years and it is     
 supposed to continue for the immediate
 future. At the present time there is a
 county group looking into the best way
 to provide education for the area     
 which includes this block.
