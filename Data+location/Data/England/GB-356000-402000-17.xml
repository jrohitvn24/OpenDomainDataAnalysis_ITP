		<content>Our school is in a council estate of   
maisonettes, high rise flats and       
houses. Most of us live here. Recently,
after less than 20 years some blocks of
5 storey flats were demolished because 
the area was overcrowded. Other child- 
ren live nearby in older terraced or   
semi-detached houses which some own.   
Inside our houses are lots of modern   
gadgets. We found that 75% of families 
own phones, 87% have 2 or more T.V.    
sets, 56% own a video, 78% a music     
centre, 59% a car and 87% have central 
heating. All mums have both a fridge   
and a washer. Of the children 25% own  
their own computer, 50% a radio and 50%
their own cassette recorder. Free      
dinners are served to 66% of the child-
ren. Most families in the area have 2  
or 3 children but 6 of our families    
have 5 children. Nicola is the only    
girl who is an only child.             </content>
