 20 boys and girls go regularly on     
 Tuesday evenings to the youth club in 
 the{village hall.}There are three     
 adults in charge. Anyone over the age 
 of eight can go along at 6.30p.m. and 
 play table or floor games until 8     
 o'clock for a subscription of 25p. In 
 summer there are outside activities   
 like swimming and rounders and        
 sometimes there are barbeques on the  
 beach. Then it is only 15p.
