		<title>08SHOPS OF OADBY</title>
		<content> In our area of Oadby there are 87     
 shops, 32 food shops and 55 non-food  
 shops. Our largest shop is Woolco     
 which is a hypermarket. Woolco is     
 popular because it is open until      
 8.00pm and suitable for disabled      
 people. Oadby has three supermarkets  
 which sell all sorts of food e.g.     
 frozen foods, greengrocers, health    
 foods, bakers, butchers, cheese and   
 hot food shops. Among the non-food    
 shops there is a great variety, e.g.  
 vets, hairdressers, electrical goods, 
 shoes, clothes, furniture, toys,      
 jewellery, chemist and paper shops.   
 There is a "Do It Yourself" shop which
 sells goods to improve the house and  
 garden. We counted 2 betting shops    
 where people go to gamble on horse    
 races and dog races. There is an      
 "Oxfam"shop which sells unwanted      
 goods and the proceeds go to charity. </content>
