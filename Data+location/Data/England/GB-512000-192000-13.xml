		<title>13CHILDREN'S EVENING LEISURE</title>
		<content>  This is how our 7-11 year olds spent 
 their time after school, this Spring. 
{ Most girls and boys spent more time  
 watching T.V.{,than anything else.    
{Some watched T.V. for 3 to 4 hrs -    
{some none at all!}But on average,     
 each child watched 1 hour each night. 
{ Most if not all children, enjoyed    
{simply}playing with a friend.         
{ }Football and bike-riding{were very  
{popular with}boys{especially with the 
{younger ones.}Older boys,- and girls, 
{spent much more time than younger     
{children playing with}computer games. 
 Gymnastics,{as well as}ballet{and}tap,
{were more popular with}girls,{who     
{ also spent more time with}pets.{     
   Youth Club,swimming,tennis,snooker, 
{and}pool,{were also popular with both 
{boys and girls,as were}reading, music,
 hobbies, shopping,{and even}gardening!
