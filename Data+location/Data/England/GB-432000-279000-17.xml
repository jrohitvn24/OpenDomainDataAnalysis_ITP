		<content> My name is Debbie Elliot. Well I go   
 down to church on Saturday at 8.am and
 come back 12 pm    I sit down and get 
 ready to sing. First,I have to read   
 a story about God. I enjoy it. After  
 I have read I listen to everyone      
 else.                                 
 Then we sing about God and we kiss the
 cross. After, we have Jamaican food,  
 fruit pie, it has mangoes and apple   
 and coconut and pastry, Jamaican      
 dumplings and stew, Jamaican corn is  
 chicken and rice and kidney beans.Then
 I go home.At half past nine I go to   
 bed on school day. Before I get into  
 bed I say my prayers and say what I   
 did. Then I read a story about God and
 then I go to sleep.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
