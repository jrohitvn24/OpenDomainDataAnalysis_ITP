		<title>06EFFECT OF APPLEBY NEW FAIR</title>
		<content> Swarthy types from towns gather here  
 for a cheap annual holiday and get-   
 together.Some are horse dealers,some  
 no doubt are decent folk,some are out 
 for what they can get.Showing off     
 horses on roads they get obstinately  
 in the way &amp; the road to Appleby is   
 even closed for 3 days during horse   
 sales.We stay near home.There are     
 extra policemen,yet things disappear. 
 We become suspicious of strangers,    
 always on our guard.Our attitude may  
 make them worse,but there is usually  
 trouble somewhere &amp; we remain tense.  
 Youths take lurchers into the woods &amp; 
 annoy the gamekeeper,woods and hedges 
 are also used for dumping rubbish and 
 worse.This is how the locals feel &amp;   
 they pay the bills for police &amp;       
 garbage clearance. On TV it is all    
 romance &amp; charm, &amp; a great attraction 
 to tourists.                          </content>
