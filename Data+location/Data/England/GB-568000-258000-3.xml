		<title>031945 AND CHEVELEY</title>
		<content> We went to Somerset Court where many  
 of the old people of Cheveley live and
 talked to some of them about life in  
 1945. Mr Watkinson told us about the  
 War-mostly the rich had air raid      
 shelters, others sheltered in         
 cupboards. Children still had to go to
 school when there were air raids and  
 bombs. He said a bomb dropped and set 
 fire to the road by Hill Farm near    
 Cheveley. In those days, there were no
 flush toilets-you had a hole in the   
 ground with a seat on top. Everyone   
 had to carry gas masks and all the    
 food was rationed.                    
 Since then the shops have changed. Now
 there is only a Post Office, but then 
 there was a butchers, a cycle         
 repairers, a blacksmiths, a bakers, a 
 post office, co-op and cobblers where 
 they would mend your shoes. There were
 buses with no roof and horse and carts</content>
