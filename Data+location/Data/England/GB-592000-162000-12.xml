		<title>12A TEYNHAM 11 YEAR OLD'S DAY</title>
		<content> Saturday 13th July started with a     
 typical Saturday morning. I got up at 
 7.30 a.m. and went downstairs. I      
 picked up my comic, 'Suzy', that is   
 delivered. For breakfast I had a      
 chocolate Penguin and cold milk. I    
 went upstairs, had a wash and cleaned 
 my teeth. I got my dancing shoes and  
 went into Sittingbourne by train. My  
 half hour dancing lesson started at   
 9 a.m. My dad came into Sittingbourne 
 by train. After my lesson I went to my
 grandad's house. We went to the Kent  
 County Show where I saw the work done 
 by my school. We went home because I  
 was going to be in the Teynham        
 carnival. When I was ready my sister  
 Denise took me to the float. When the 
 carnival finished I went home and     
 watched the 'Live Aid' pop concert on 
 television. Then I went to bed.
