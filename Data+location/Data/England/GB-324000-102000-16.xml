		<title>16BEACON HILL</title>
		<content> Above Paradise Farm in the small      
 hamlet of Heathstock is{Beacon Hill   
{Triangulation Point}in the SW.corner  
 of the D-Block. It is 719 feet above  
 sea-level.                            
 The view of our D-block from the      
 Triangulation point is very good.The  
 furthest you can see on a fine day is 
 Seaton.                               
 There's an old story that the         
 Triangalation Point used to be called 
 "The Devil's Frying Pan". This is due 
 to the shape of the hill, which looks 
 like a handle, and a nearby clump of  
 trees, which looks like the pan.The   
 story goes that witches were burnt    
 here. Later,effigies of witches were  
 burnt. The local farmer remembers as a
 child being told by his father not to 
 touch the charred sticks,as this would
 bring bad luck.
