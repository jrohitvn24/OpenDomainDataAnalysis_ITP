		<title>05ODCOMBE GIRL GUIDES.</title>
		<content>  The{GIRL GUIDE COMPANY}at Odcombe was
 started in January 1984. As far as I  
 know this is the first time there has 
 been a company in the village. Our    
 numbers vary from 15_25 and at present
 there are 16 guides. The company      
 serves{Odcombe,Montacute, Stoke-sub-  
{Hamdon}and{West Coker}but the majority
 of the girls are from Odcombe.The     
 leaders have always been from outside 
 the village. The{Guide}programme      
 includes service to{GOD}and the       
 community,{self_discipline,}and self  
 reliance, fitness, home_craft and     
 knowledge of the living world, the    
 arts and mankind. We attend church    
 regularly at Odcombe. We also learn   
 about living out of doors and camping.
 Ten of the{Guides }will attend an     
 international camp at Cheddar in July,
 which will be in celebration of       
{seventy five years}of Guiding.        </content>
