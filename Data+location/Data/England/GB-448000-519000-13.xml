		<title>13A DAY IN MY LIFE 3</title>
		<content>    After I have finished my tea, I get
 ready for Mosque. I leave my house at 
 about 4.40, and reach Mosque at 4.45. 
    At Mosque we learn about our       
 prophet, Mohammed. We learn the Quran 
 too. We also write and read Urdu.     
    At 7.00 I go home and have my      
 supper which is usually chappatti with
 spinach or Halal meat. My mother      
 insists that I should read my reading 
 book instead of doing the dishes.     
    When I have finished reading I play
 Hangman or chess until we are tired,  
 and then I go to bed, usually about   
 10.00.
