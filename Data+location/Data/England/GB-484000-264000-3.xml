		<content> SThe church of St. Mary is the oldest 
building in the village,dating back to 
the reign of King John in the early    
{13th century.} It stands on the side  
of a hill away from the main road. It  
is worth stopping the car and walking  
up the road to look more closely at its
interesting features. The first thing  
to catch your eye will probably be the 
magnificent tower with its striking    
flying buttresses which support the    
octagonal spire. At the lower end of   
the tower you will notice four imposing
gargoyles and the large pinnacles which
are at each of the four corners.       
 Inside there is an attractive nave    
with a south arcade dating from the    
{14th century.} You should note the    
plain stone font which is medieval, the
attractive rood screen which separates 
the tower and the nave and the{ 17th   
century} pulpit.                       </content>
