		<title>04Education: Area School.</title>
		<content> ADVANTAGES:At an area school we have  
 more friends and teachers and a       
 different type of education.We are    
 able to have a lot of team sports like
 football, hockey, netball, cricket and
 rounders. We have a  chance to play in
 matches with  other schools. There are
 enough children to  have  an orchestra
 and violin lessons.We are able to have
 puppet shows,plays and  demonstrations
 by professional groups.We invite      
 nearby small schools to join us for   
 these. We take our Christmas services 
 out to the churches  and chapels in   
 the villages.                         
 DISADVANTAGES:  Classes are  sometimes
 bigger than in smaller  schools It can
 be  difficult for parents to come into
 school  because  of transport problems
 We cannot  stay after school for extra
 activities  unless  we  have  our  own
 transport.                            </content>
