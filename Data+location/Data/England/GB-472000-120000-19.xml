		<title>19TRANSPORT - ROADS</title>
		<content>{BY-PASS:}A by-pass has been planned   
 since the 1930s but without a positive
 result.  There are 4 routes under     
 consideration, starting from the dual 
 carriageway at Butser.  3 routes run  
 west of the railway line and curve    
 around the northern limits of         
 Petersfield, through an area          
 designated as outstanding natural     
 beauty. The fourth turns east         
 following the low land to the south of
 Petersfield. {MINOR ROADS:}Farms and  
 villages are connected by minor roads 
 which are single lane and often sunken
 well below field level.  Farm vehicles
 especially combine harvesters can     
 cause serious hold-ups on such roads. 
{BUS SERVICE:}Frequent buses from      
 Petersfield to Portsmouth travel along
 the A3, and the occasional bus calls  
 at Buriton.                           
                                       </content>
