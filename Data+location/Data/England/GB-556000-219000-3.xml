		<title>03TAKELEY, THE VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Takeley is a long village stretched   
 out along the A120 road.  Originally  
 the whole village lay on the north    
 side of the road but since the 1930's 
 a little development has taken place  
 to the south; the railway has created 
 a barrier to further development.  The
 village, unlike many nearby, is not   
 noted for its beauty but does have    
 several buildings of great historical 
 interest.  Today the village has only 
 5 shops and 3  public houses which    
 compares with 10 public houses and 15 
 shops in 1821.  Great changes have    
 taken place over the past twenty years
 with many newcomers arriving.  To its 
 great credit, the village has accepted
 them all and they have been fully     
 absorbed into the community.   This is
 reflected in the large number of      
 active clubs and societies which      
 flourish in the village today.        </content>
