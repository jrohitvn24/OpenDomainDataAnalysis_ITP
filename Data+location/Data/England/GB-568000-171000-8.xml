		<title>08  SHORNE VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content> Shorne village hall is in the centre  
 of the village. It has become a place 
 where the people of the village can   
 meet and has been responsible for     
 making the village such a close       
 community. The village hall is used   
 every day and by about 90 per cent of 
 the villagers. Various clubs and      
 societies use the hall including;     
 ballet, playgroup,youth club,         
 badminton, Darby and Joan, local      
 history, Dickens society and flower   
 arranging. The hall is run by a       
 committee who organise fund raising   
 activities.                           
  In 1978 the hall was greatly extended
 to cater for the growing population in
 the village. It is now used by young  
 and old and is very much the          
 centrepiece of the village.
