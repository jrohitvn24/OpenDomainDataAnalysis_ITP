		<title>08A Timber Frame Home</title>
		<content> My new home is going to be a bungalow.
 We are building it ourselves.My father
 is an architect and he has designed   
 it.There is going to be a lounge,a    
 dining room,a kitchen,a bathroom,a    
 separate toilet,three bedrooms,a      
 hallway and a garage.There will be    
 quite a big back garden where we will 
 be able to grow our own vegetables.The
 bungalow is a timber framed one,these 
 make it easy for families to build    
 their own homes and they are quite    
 common in this part of the            
 country.Everybody in my family is     
 helping including my little brother   
 who is only seven.We are building in  
 the evenings,weekends and during any  
 spare time we manage to get hold of.  
 We are looking forward to living in   
 our bungalow,hopefully in October.It  
 will be especially satisfying having  
 built it ourselves.                   </content>
