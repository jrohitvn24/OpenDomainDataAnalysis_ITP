		<content>Our area has three villages, Moulton,  
Gazeley and Kentford. Each of the      
villages has a church. The Moulton     
Church dates back to Norman times. The 
River Kennet runs through our area,    
which is quite hilly and the highest   
point is 92 feet above sea level. There
are schools in both Moulton and        
Gazeley. There are quite a few small   
businesses moving into the area. Most  
of the roads are country lanes and     
there isn't much traffic except on the 
new A45 by-pass which since 1975 has   
restored Kentford's peace and quiet. As
we are near Newmarket there are a lot  
of studs because of the horse racing   
industry. Some interesting places to   
visit are, the Packhorse Bridge, and a 
boy's grave which is mentioned on page 
14. Most of the landcover is farmland  
and woodland. On the whole we think our
area is a very pleasant place to live. </content>
