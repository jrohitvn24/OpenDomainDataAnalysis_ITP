		<title>12EVENTS IN KINGS NORTON</title>
		<content>Kings Norton Mop Fair is held on the   
1st Monday in October on the village   
green.It was a hiring fair.People see- 
king work would go to the fair carrying
the tools of their trade.A shepard took
a crook,a milkmaid took a stool and the
housemaid took a mop.This is how the   
fair came to be named!A small sum of   
money was given to seal the contract.  
This could be spent at the fair.Today  
the fair is held to collect money for  
charity,and to provide enjoyment.There 
is an ox roast and a baby show:a trav- 
eling fair puts up round-abouts and    
stalls.People come from miles around   
by car,bus, and train.We went on the   
ski jump; my mum won a raffle and she  
won a mirror and a pair of extra large 
tights.Then we had some candy floss it 
was pink I won a poster of Boy George. 
We went on the Walzers.By Jacqueline
