<title>22The Ridings 27 years on</title>
<content>For twenty seven years the Ridings Shopping Centre has been the central point for shopping in the Wakefield area, however its tourist attraction waned over the years with new bigger and better shopping centres opening in Leeds and Sheffield. The central lift remains and cosmectically it has undergone several 'spruce ups' over the years bur the layout has remained the same. Over the last ten years many of the big names in Retail have either disappeared or moved to more financially viable areas, leaving the centre with lots of small businesses. Over the years one thing that I have always been impressed with is their Christmas decorations insode the centre.&lt;br />&lt;br />Twenty seven years on and Wakefield is undergoing massive redevelopment all over the city, road layouts have changed, and this year (2011) a new huge shopping centre has been opened on the outskirts of town which may just be the final nail in the coffin for the Ridings which does now look old.&lt;br />
