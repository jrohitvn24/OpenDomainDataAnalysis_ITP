		<title>16ARTS/ENTERTAINMENT IN LEWES</title>
		<content>      With no commercial entertainment 
 in Lewes, all is organised, and mostly
 performed, by{local people,}drawing on
 an enormous amount of local talent.   
     {All Saints' Centre}is typical: a 
 disused church converted by volunteers
 and MSC money to an arts centre: full-
 scale opera to a Toy Library for todd-
 lers.{Lewes Little Theatre}stages, in 
 its own theatre, high standard monthly
 amateur performances.{Lewes Operatic  
{Society}entertains the town with at   
 least two light operas a year. Several
{pantos}are performed in community     
 centres around Christmas.             
      Although there is no town        
 orchestra or choir, there are{musical 
{groups}performing classical, folk and 
 jazz in pubs, halls or homes. Young   
 people go to ballet or drama classes. 
{Sussex Rural School}offers a variety  
 of instrumental teaching.             </content>
