		<content> TRANSPORT LINKS ARE MAJOR FEATURES OF 
 THIS BLOCK.THERE ARE MAIN ROADS WHICH 
 PASS THROUGH THE AREA AND THESE       
 CONVERGE ON THE TOWN CENTRE TO USE THE
 TWO BRIDGES WHICH PROVIDE THE ONLY    
 MEANS OF CROSSING THE RIVER WEAVER FOR
 MANY MILES.THE RIVER WEAVER,ALTHOUGH  
 NOT AS IMPORTANT AS IT WAS IN THE     
 PAST,IS STILL A MAJOR MEANS OF CARGO  
 TRANSPORT FOR THE ICI CHEMICAL PLANTS,
 AS ARE THE CANALS IN THE AREA.        
 THE MAIN PASSENGER RAILWAY IN THE AREA
 IS THE MANCHESTER TO CHESTER          
 LINE.THERE ARE TWO STATIONS,ONE AT    
 NORTHWICH AND ONE AT GREENBANK.HOWEVER
 THE MAJORITY OF RAILWAY LINES ARE USED
 FOR THE TRANSPORT OF LIMESTONE FROM   
 DERBYSHIRE FOR USE AT ICI.            
 NORTHWICH IS A VERY BUSY CENTRE FOR   
 TRANSPORT NETWORKS AND ALSO HAS AN    
 INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT ONLY A FEW MILES
 AWAY AT MANCHESTER.                   </content>
