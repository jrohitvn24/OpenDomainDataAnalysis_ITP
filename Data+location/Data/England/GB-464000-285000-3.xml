		<title>03HOTHORPE HALL THEDDINGWORTH</title>
		<content> The site of the old village of        
 Hothorpe is in front of Hothorpe Hall.
 The road to Hothorpe started from the 
 west end of Theddingworth. Old houses 
 and the road were dismantled early in 
 the 19th century to improve the       
 landscaping of the Hall and replaced  
 by the present road and Pebble        
 Cottages. The attics of these cottages
 were used for the weaving of plush    
 for silk hats. All that remains of    
 Hothorpe village now is the main Hall,
 with its own Chapel. Until recently it
 was a Lutheran Centre but now it is   
 run by an Anglican group as a         
 conference centre                     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
