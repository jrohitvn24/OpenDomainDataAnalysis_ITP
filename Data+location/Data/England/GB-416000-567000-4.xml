		<content>   In the summer we have 6 weeks       
 holiday starting at about July 19th   
 until september 2nd.                  
   It is normally quite warm at this   
 time so we drive about in the country-
 side and have a picnic or we go to the
 seaside and have fish and chips along 
 by the water.  Then we go the spanish 
 City funfair and have a go on all the 
 big rides.                            
   Last year we went to Eyemouth and   
 stayed in a caravan and I was allowed 
 to take a friend.                     
   If I do not go on holiday, I play   
 tennis, go to the swimming baths or   
 play with my dog in the back garden.  
 Sometimes me and my friends go for    
 walks or we jog down to the farm.     
 Often on Saturdays er go to the town  
 (Newcastle) for clothes and for our   
 dinner.
