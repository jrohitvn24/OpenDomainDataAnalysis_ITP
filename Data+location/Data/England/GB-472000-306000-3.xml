		<title>03MIXED FARMING IN N-E LEICS.</title>
		<content>  The nature of the{terrain}here, being
 rolling hills and valleys means that  
 not all land is suitable for large    
 scale arable farming methods.Hence the
 farmers try to optimize their use of  
 the land by{rearing animals}on that   
 land unsuitable for arable use.Where  
 the slope permits however, field      
 boundaries have been removed to make  
 larger more economic units suitable   
 for extensive{cultivation.            
  The nature of mixed farming allows   
 the farmer to spread his workload     
 evenly throughout the year and to     
 minimize the{"risk factor"}inherent in
 all farming due to climate, disease,  
 etc.                                  
  Many aspects of mixed farming are    
{complementary}e.g. animals provide    
 manure for fertiliser and the animals 
 use the surplus straw from cereal     
 cultivation as fodder and litter.     </content>
