 The old idea of the country person is 
 not to be found any longer.The oldest 
 inhabitants have moved with the times 
 using cars &amp; buses to get them to the 
 towns &amp; super-markets.The school break
 -in by outside people moving from one 
 place to another by van is an alarming
 development.The proposed motor-way    
 M4o, although useful to the commuters 
 could alter local roads &amp; convenience.
 Hedges have already been planted to   
 screen from the proposed site.Wyatt's 
 farm remains as a typical Warwickshire
 farm house,stables &amp; barns have been  
 converted into houses,the old forge   
 has long since disappeared &amp; is now a 
 house.White House Farm is now a modern
 bungalow,never used as a farm!The farm
 buildings have been converted to other
 bungalows with garages.The residential
 part is separate from{farm business.  </content>
