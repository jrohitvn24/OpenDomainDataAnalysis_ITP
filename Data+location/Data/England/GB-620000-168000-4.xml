		<title>04Farming-Reculver Oyster Farm</title>
		<content>Reculver Oyster farm is situated right 
next to the sea wall at Reculver.Four  
children visited the farm.The farm     
breeds mostly oysters.The first stage  
is collecting the oysters eggs.A male  
and female oyster are put into a bowl  
of water, the female lays about one    
hundred thousand eggs at a time.The    
male gives off a kind of black         
dust.When these eggs are fertilized    
they are put on to trays full of water.
They are so small they can only be seen
under a microscope.Mr John Bays who    
owns the oyster farm showed us around  
and also put some of these tiny eggs   
under the microscope for us to look    
at.The oyster eggs are left on the     
trays to grow,each tray contains about 
two million eggs.After a few days the  
eggs have grown enough to be moved into
larger tanks because now they need to  
feed or they would no longer develop.  </content>
