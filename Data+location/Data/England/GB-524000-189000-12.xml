		<content> Results of survey carried out amongst 
 200 children at Brookland School on   
 7th June 1985.                        
 The question asked was:Were you born  
 in britain or abroad? &amp; Where were    
 your parents born?                    
 We found that 29% of the children were
 born abroad and 52% of the parents    
 were born abroad.We therefore assume  
 that the majority of people in the    
 parent's generation living in the area
 were born abroad.                     
 The birth places of the parents are   
 widely scattered:                     
                                       
 81 from Asia; 50 from Africa; 26 from 
 America; 5 from Australia; and 51 from
 European countries other than Britain.
                                       
 The greatest numbers came from Japan  
 and India with even numbers followed  
 by Kenya and South Africa.            </content>
