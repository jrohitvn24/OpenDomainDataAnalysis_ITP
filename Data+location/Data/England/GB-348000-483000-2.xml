		<content> Plumtree Hall is a residential home   
 for elderly people. It is situated    
 approximately 2OO yards south of      
 Heversham C.E. Primary.  Plumtree Hall
 was built in l82O.  It now has ten    
 single residents, one couple and one  
 house-keeper.  When we went there we  
 only had time to interveiw one person 
 mainly.  She was called Mrs. Mellor.  
 Mrs. Munro has been there the longest 
 which is l2 years.  She came from     
 Kendal.  One of the apartments was    
 made out of a hay loft (Mrs. Mellors.)
  The Plumtree residents must be       
 retired but active.  The ladies have  
 every other Thursday in Mrs. Mellors  
 flat having their hair done.  They    
 also have a communion service once a  
 month.  Mrs. Mellor has lived in the  
 area for 35 years but has been at     
 Plumtree Hall for 6 years.
