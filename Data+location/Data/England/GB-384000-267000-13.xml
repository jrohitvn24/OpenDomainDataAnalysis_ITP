		<title>13GEOLOGY &amp; NATURAL RESOURCES</title>
		<content> The ice sheets retreated, exposing the
 Keuper deposits of the{Triassic Age.  
 The{Beaker People}migrated in, gladly 
 cultivating the Lower Sandstone beds  
 in the West (and the intrusion in the 
 North East) and grazing on the Marl   
 elsewhere.                            
 Their cultural descendants - the Fast 
 Food Folk - are still there: for this 
 is Nature's Own Wonderful Hamburger   
 Land, where all the ingredients abound
 for the picking.Onions, salad and     
 french fries in the West: buns on the 
 intrusion; beef (cheese too) in the   
 centre.And there are{salt}deposits on 
 the side as well.                     
 It probably says much about the level 
 of enterprise of the natives when one 
 realises that they have signally      
 failed to reap advantage from this    
 wondrous Natural Resource that lies   
 beneath their unresponsive feet.      </content>
