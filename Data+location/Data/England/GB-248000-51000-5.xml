		<title>05THE MILK MARKETING BOARD</title>
		<content>    The Milk Marketing Board which     
 has offices in the Broadway was       
 founded in October 1957 by the local  
{farmers.                              
    Vans from the M.M.B. go to farms,  
{dairies}etc. They take three samples  
 of milk from each{cow.}Each sample has
 about 25 ml of milk which is put in a 
 plastic test-tube. These test-tubes   
 are labelled with the name of the cow 
 and its owner.                        
    One of the test-tubes has a        
 preservative to stop it turning sour. 
 The other two are kept cold so that if
 any{bacteria}are in the milk they     
 will not spread. The milk van then    
 returns to the Milk Marketing Board's 
{laboratories.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
