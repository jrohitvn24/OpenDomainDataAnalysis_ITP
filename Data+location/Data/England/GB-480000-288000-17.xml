		<year>1986</year>
		<title>17HOBBIES AND INTERESTS</title>
		<content>The current crazes for 1985 are B.M.X. 
bikes,computers and board games.The    
most popular computers are the B.B.C., 
Commodore,Spectrum,Dragon and Vic 20.  
Most of the children play games on them
from a huge variety.Pocket computer    
games are also popular.The B.M.X. craze
is increasing rapidly,with a variety of
tricks like Bunny hops and Wheelies you
can do.Safety padding should be worn,  
but few do.                            
The bikes,like the Raleigh Burner are  
not really suitable for the road,and   
children are always looking for        
suitable places for tracks.            
The "hit" board game this year is      
called "Trivial Pursuit" - a general   
knowledge game with questions of no    
particular importance.
