 Our blacksmith is called Mr Bird.     
 His forge is situated in the yard     
 behind the Post Office.It has been    
 there for a long time.Mr Bird's father
 and grandfather both worked there.The 
 forge is not very far from the        
 crossroads so perhaps it used to get a
 lot of work from travellers.Now Mr    
 Bird spends most of his time shoeing  
 horses and people come to him from all
 the villages around Shefford.         
         He showed us the old bellows  
 for his fire but now he uses an       
 electric fan.He also showed us the    
 special place in his yard where       
 cartwheels were put so that an iron   
 tyre could be fitted to them.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
