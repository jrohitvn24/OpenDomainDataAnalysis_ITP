 population in this area,there are 6

 important as it once was,but is still 
 fairly well supported.                
{St.Michael's}at the top of Ramsey hill
 overlooks the valley,and there has    
 been a church on this sight since     
 Saxon times.The original was a wooden 
 structure,rebuilt in stone by the     
 Normans,and part of this remains      
 today.Visitors might also look for the
 16th C pulpit,15th C font,and pre     
 civil war Royal arms.                 
 There are 2{Methodist}chapels in the  
 area,and the most recent is next to   
 the mill footpath in Ramsey,this has  
 13 members.The chapel in{Little Oakley
 was built as recently as 1969,even    
 though it only has 15 members.The     
 minister of both{Rev Lemmon}looks     
 after 5 others;people are friendly.   </content>
