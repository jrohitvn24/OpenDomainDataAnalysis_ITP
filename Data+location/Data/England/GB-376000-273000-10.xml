		<title>10HOW BEWDLEY HAS CHANGED</title>
		<content>  Bewdley was at it's most prosperous  
 in the Eighteenth century. It was a   
 busy port, at the head of the         
 navigable part of the{River Severn.}  
 There were many local crafts and a    
 large market. When the canal system   
 bypassed{Bewdley}to{Stourport}this    
 prosperity ceased. Nowadays Bewdley is
 a commuter town for the big Midland   
 towns. Many people live here for the  
 beautiful scenery and peace and quiet.
 It is also a tourist attraction with  
 the{Wyre Forest,}the{Safari Park,}the 
 river and steam railway. The Severn   
 Valley Railway is the longest private 
 railway in the country. It was started
 in 1971 ten years after the Bridgnorth
 line was closed down by British       
 Railways.Because of the traffic       
 congestion from commuters and tourists
 Bewdley has been fighting for many    
 years for a bypass which has started. </content>
