		<title>03ROUND ISLAND NEAR ARNE</title>
		<content>                                       
   Round Island is to the East of the  
 Arne Peninsula. Vegetation on the     
 island consists mainly of trees,      
 especially pine trees. One of the     
 warden's jobs is to clear the needles.
 No cultivation is practised on the    
 island due to the peacock population. 
 Saltings are located between Round and
 Long island where black-headed gulls  
 have their breeding grounds.          
 Unfortunately eggs are taken illegally
 because they are a delicacy and cost  
 about 25p each.                       
   The main large house was built by   
 Major Laurence for his daughter Lady  
 Illisse in 1935 on the S.E. side.     
 There are also four other cottages on 
 the island; one, on the N.W. side is  
 Ceder Wood Cottage where Thomas       
 Beecham wrote his "Life of Delius."
