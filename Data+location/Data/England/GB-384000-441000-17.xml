		<title>17LEEDS - LIVERPOOL CANAL</title>
		<content> This was begun in 1770 and finished in
 1816. It is 127 miles long, the       
 longest single canal in Britain. This 
 is probably one of the most attractive
 stretches of the canal passing through
 open countryside.The canal reaches its
 summit of 150 metres above sea level  
 just south of our block and gets water
 from streams and reservoirs in the    
 area (see{WHITEMOOR RESERVOIR}). It   
 passes under Wanless Bridge, an old   
 stone bridge carrying a narrow country
 lane, leading from Colne to  Blacko.  
 The canal then enters the {MILE TUNNEL
 - actually 1640 yards long. The tunnel
 has been repaired and new air shafts  
 constructed during the last few years.
 In 1912, a cow became famous when it  
 fell into the canal and swam through  
 the tunnel.It was rescued at{FOULRIDGE
 and revived.Leisure craft are a common
 sight on this stretch of the canal.   </content>
