		<title>15Great Totham School</title>
		<content>      In 1971 the old village schools  
 of Great Totham and Wickham Bishops   
 amalgamated to form the new Great     
 Totham County Primary School, on a    
 site in Walden House Road.            
      The school was built on a semi   
 open plan design. There are 6 Infant  
 classes and 9 Junior Classes in the   
 school at present, comprising of 448  
 children and 17 teachers. The         
 Headmaster has been at the school     
 since it opened.                      
      The school has a learner pool and
 an infant outside work area provided  
 by the P.T.A. It has 5 B.B.C. micro-  
 computers. It has a strong musical    
 tradition. Many clubs and societies   
 meet before and after school:         
  Gymnastics, Country Dancing, Soccer, 
 Netball, Chess, Needlework, Y.O.C.,   
 Computers, Orchestra, Short Tennis,   
 and Badminton.                        </content>
