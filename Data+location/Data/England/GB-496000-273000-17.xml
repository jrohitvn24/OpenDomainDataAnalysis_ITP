By tradition we have our May Day on a  
Saturday afternoon.After the town crier
welcomes in visitors the May Queen     
parades round with the petal throwers  
in front.The children sit down and the 
May Queen is crowned by the previous   
May Queen who is given a bouquet by the
flower-girl,one of the youngest        
children.The septre-bearer makes her   
speech and it is followed by the May   
Queen commanding the dancing to start. 
The programme includes country dances, 
sword,morris and may-pole dancing.This 
year we had a balloon race to see      
whose balloon went the furthest.After  
the celebration there were drinks,     
cakes,crisps and icecream to have in   
our school hall.                       
It was a beautiful warm day this year.
