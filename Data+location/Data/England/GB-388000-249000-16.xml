		<title>16Village School, Littleworth</title>
		<content>   Opposite the Retreat Inn is a small 
 building which used to be Norton      
 village school. It was built in 1800  
 for children aged five to ten years   
 old. Originally there were two small  
 classrooms and a hallway which was    
 later converted to make an extra      
 classroom.                            
   For the last fiften or more years   
 the building has not been used because
 a new Junior school has been built    
 down the road at Littleworth. The new 
 school is controlled by the Church and
 has thirty eight pupils aged five to  
 nine years old.  After nine, the      
 children must travel to Drakes        
 Broughton Middle School.              
   Children at Littlewoth School come  
 from the village, Norton and Hatfield.
 There are few city children.  Locals  
 hope the size of the school will grow 
 as there are new houses being built.  </content>
