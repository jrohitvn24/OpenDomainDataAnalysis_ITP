		<title>14DEWSNAP SIDINGS DUKINFIELD</title>
		<content>            The railway sidings were   
 originally known as{Dog Lane          
{Sidings.As Dukinfield became more     
{important the sidings were extended   
{until they covered the old Astley Deep
{Pit}.As old industries declined so did
 the railways and the sidings became   
 disused.Once there were four railway  
 stations in Dukinfield- now there is  
 only one line and there are no        
 stations.                             
      Some of the old rusty tracks in  
 the sidings have been taken up now and
 the rest are full of weeds.Children   
 often  play there-though they         
 shouldn't- and they often hide in the 
 few old sheds still left up.Some of   
 them even go up there to try          
 glue-sniffing.The old carriage works  
 is now used by a timber firm.
