		<content> Oakley Soils have their main offices  
 on the Cambride Road, on the western  
 side of Linton. In the spring of 1985 
 they took over the premises of a      
 garage just south of the A. 604(bypass
 road) The premises stand on the       
 old Haverhill Cambridge road, and     
 access onto the bypass is very        
 simple.Oakley Soils has been          
 going since  Chistmas  1984  and  is  
 owned  by  Mr. Oakley.                
 There  are  three  mechanics  and     
 one  apprentice working there.        
 They  hope  to  be  building  a       
 new  work  shop  soon.                
 They  mend Oakley  Soils              
 agricultural   machinery  and         
 their main  job  is  piling and       
 stuctural  underpinning.              
 They  own  35 road vehicles
