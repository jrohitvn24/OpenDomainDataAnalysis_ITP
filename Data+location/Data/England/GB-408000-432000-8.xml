		<content> Our square was almost completely      
 rural. It consisted of several        
 isolated farmhouses which produced    
{DAIRY}products and also grew{HAY}for  
 the stock animals.                    
    One farm, Jerusalem Farm, has been 
 converted into an{ANIMAL MEAT FACTORY}
 and has extended the original         
 buildings.There are traces of two     
 disused quarries.Only a few cottages  
 exist in this square and they have few
 amenities.There is one {PUBLIC HOUSE,}
 the White Horse Inn and two bus stops 
 on the main road.Two pupils from our  
 school live in the{COTTAGE}at Moscow  
 and have to walk to and from school   
 every day.
