		<content>    Inside A House.                    
   My house is built of bricks. It has 
 a red roof made of tiles. The front   
 door is wood with a glass panel in the
 middle. We have carpets on the floors 
 but in the kitchen we have lino tiles 
 and a rug.                            
   In the living room we have two sofas
 to sit on. In the corner we have a    
 television to watch. We have wall     
 units with books and ornaments in. The
 fireplace is made of tiles and it has 
 ornaments on as well. The fire is a   
 coal fire. We have a brass coal       
 scuttle with pictures of horses on. It
 stays near the fire but the coal is   
 kept outside in a bunker.             
   The walls are covered with different
 shaped bricks. We have painted them.  
 The other rooms have wallpaper on     
 them.
