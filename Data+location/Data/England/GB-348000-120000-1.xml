		<content>  We divided our block into kilometre  
 suqares and each square was surveyed  
 by 3 pupils and a teacher to discover 
 and plot land use and amenities.      
  The results showed that most of the  
 block is grassland,mainly for cattle  
 grazing,with some arable crops and    
 some fruit.The houses were mainly     
 isolated farmhouses,most built in     
 lacal Hamstone and very               
 attractive.There are few amenities and
 little public transport,most people   
 having motor cars,which are           
 necessities rather than luxuries in   
 this type of area.Most people go into 
 Yeovil for shopping and entertainment.
 The following accounts were written by
 2nd and 3rd year pupils at{Westfield  
{Comprehensive School,Yeovil.}
