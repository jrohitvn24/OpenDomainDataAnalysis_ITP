		<title>14Reen Manor Farm</title>
		<content> I went to Reen Manor Farm.The man who 
 owns it is Mr.Opie.This farm was      
 mentioned in the very first Domesday  
 Book.It was probably there before     
 700AD.Part of it was an old chapel    
 which had something to do with Chapel 
 Rock on the beach.He gave us a drink  
 and showed us his son's pet turantula.
 We took some photos and did some      
 sketches of the farm buildings.We used
 a cassette recorder for our interview.
 A dog came out and scared us.Mr.Opie  
 said that the farm has changed a great
 deal this year.Last year it was a real
 farm but now he has sold most of his  
 animals and turned his buildings into 
 holiday chalets.He still had some     
 horses in one of the fields.We went in
 Miss Perriman's metro.When we got back
 to school we told the rest of the     
 class about our trip.I enjoyed it very
 much.                                 </content>
