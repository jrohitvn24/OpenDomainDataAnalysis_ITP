		<title>13PUNKY LANTERN,DALWOOD.</title>
		<content>  Punky Lantern night is a Halloween   
 celebration held in Dalwood at the end
 of October each year. The children    
 from the school make lanterns with    
 mangles supplied by a local farmer.   
 Some people use pumpkins which they   
 have grown. The lanterns are lit by   
 candles and there is an evening       
 procession to the local hostelry, the 
 Tucker's Arms. After the parade there 
 is a spooky disco for the children in 
 the skittle alley behind the pub.Some 
 are dressed as witches, ghouls  or    
 spooks. The skittle alley is decorated
 with spiders and webs.The food is made
 to resemble frogs'legs, bats'         
 wings(chicken),blood(tomato sauce),   
 and sugar mice. Witches brew is made  
 from lemonade and blackcurrant juice.
