		<title>08THE BUS STATION</title>
		<content>    There are 25 bus routes from       
 Worksop bus station. Most buses have  
 only a driver who also takes the      
 fares. There are only six conductors  
 now at the Worksop bus station.       
    The buses run on diesel and        
 together they use about 900 gallons a 
 day. The life span of a bus is seven  
 years. The tyres are rented and the   
 company pay for the tread used. There 
 are 53 buses based at Worksop. Ten are
 out of use each day for servicing and 
 repairs.                              
    The drivers work shifts, one week  
 on days and one week afternoons and   
 evenings. They are paid on Fridays and
 have to belong to a union.
