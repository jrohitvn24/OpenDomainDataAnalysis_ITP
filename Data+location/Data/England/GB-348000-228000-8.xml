 The local surgery was built in 1970   
 and is situated next to the community 
 centre.There are two doctors, Dr      
 Garlick and Dr Davies. The            
 administration of the surgery is by   
 two full-time staff, a medical manager
 and secretary. There are 3 part-time  
 staff involved with the 3700 patients.
 The surgery handles about 150-200     
 visiting patients per week, and the   
 doctors make in excess of 300 house   
 calls weekly.There are three district 
 nurses attached, one of whom is a     
 midwife and health visitor.           
 There is one patient 100 years old and
 about 17% are over 65 years old. The  
 doctors have 3 other surgeries outside
 our area, so covering a very large    
 area.
