		<title>12RUDDINGTON WAKES</title>
		<content> THE {ST.PETER'S FEAST }was held for   
 hundreds of years near to June 29th.  
 and when schooling started in         
{Ruddington}they used to get a weeks   
 holiday. The feast was held on {The   
{Green}and they would have competiotns 
 like climbing a greasy pole,guessing  
 the weight of a pig and a tug of war  
 between the Framework Knitters and    
 farmworkers.                          
 Since 1968 it has been held on the    
{Recreation Ground}on{Wilford Road}and 
 it is only a visiting fair run by     
 Cox's.                                
 I asked the children at school what   
 they liked best at the{Wakes.}
