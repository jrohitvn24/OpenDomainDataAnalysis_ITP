		<title>10Houses in Woodchurch</title>
		<content> The first houses were very simple in  
 design - consisting of wood and       
 natural materials. They used branches 
 to form a skeleton and twigs          
 were woven in between.  A coating of  
 clay and straw was used to fill the   
 spaces, and large stones were used    
 round the base to give extra strength.
 The Wealden Hall type house{(Hendon   
{Place)}built in the 14th and 15th C,  
 was a timber structure on 2 floors.   
 The main Hall was the height of the   
 house and was used for various        
 purposes.  In it was the fire and as  
 there were no chimneys, the smoke     
 billowed round and found its way out  
 of slits at roof level.In the 17th C, 
 people wanted more privacy, so the    
 "hall" disappeared.  The smoke from   
 the fire now went up a chimney and the
 roof space was used for accommodation,
 as in the{Old School House,Woodchurch.</content>
