		<title>17Gardening in Cattistock</title>
		<content> An annual event in Cattistock is the  
 Garden Walkabout.  20 gardens are open
 for one afternoon in June in aid of   
 Church and charity.  Teas and locally 
 grown plants are on sale and over 90  
 people are involved in the            
 organisation.  The gardens range from 
 the small orderly, shrubs from        
 cuttings, alpines, organic and herbs, 
 old fashioned cottage, walled and     
 formal, vegetables only, to gardens   
 planted for easy care.  All are       
 colourful and cared for.              
 Many old and unusual plants are grown 
 from seed and cuttings.  One garden is
 open weekly and specializes in        
 endangered species, many variegated   
 shrubs and plants and unusual ground  
 cover.                                
 The eight village allotments on glebe 
 land are not now widely used.   They  
 are some distance from the houses.    </content>
