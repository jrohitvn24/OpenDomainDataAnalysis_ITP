		<title>04Scalebyhill Village</title>
		<content>  The only residential area in the     
 block is Scalebyhill.This is a small  
 group of stone cottages, terraced     
 brick houses and more modern homes.   
 There are more houses, old and new,   
 along the road South of the village.  
 Some of the owners work in the area.  
 Others commute to urban areas to work,
 or have retired to live in the country
  There are two possible reasons why   
 Scalebyhill is here. Most of the      
 houses are close to the road passing  
 through the village.Now it peters out,
 but may once have been a busier thor- 
 oughfare. Or the village may have     
 gathered around the Methodist chapel, 
 built in an open field in 1828(see    
 page 5).                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
