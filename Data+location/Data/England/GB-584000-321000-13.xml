		<title>13FUND RAISING BIKE RIDES</title>
		<content>  A Weasenham family sadly lost their  
 youngest member last year. He died at 
 the age of 10 months.In his memory,   
 his sisters, brother and parents have 
 been raising money for the Child Care 
 Cancer Fund based at Great Ormond     
 street, London.A successful village   
 fete was held. This was organised and 
 run by the children with their parents
 help. A sponsored cycle ride to       
 Swaffham and back (aprox 20 miles) was
 undertaken by 38 members of the family
 and friends.Everyone completed the    
 journey including the youngest, aged  
 5,the baby's brother.A spectator in   
 Swaffham was so impressed to see him  
 he gave him Â£2 on the spot.The baby's 
 grand parents have held another fete  
 in Dereham and funds raised so far are
 in the region of Â£2,000.The children  
 hope to make the bike ride an annual  
 event.                                </content>
