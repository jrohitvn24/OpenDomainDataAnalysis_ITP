		<title>15FASHION IN THE EIGHTIES</title>
		<content>{Flying-suits}are all the fashion. They
 are all-in-one suits for ladies and   
 teenage girls.They have a zip or      
 buttons all down the front and they   
 are normally baggy. They are in very  
 bright colours this year (1985) such  
 as brilliant jade-green scarlet or    
 blue.                                 
 All the fashion garments this year    
 have been big in that they have to    
 look several sizes larger than the    
 correct one.People who are older than 
 teenagers have disliked these fashions
 because they say they are 'not smart'.
{Trousers}are still very popular also  
 blue-denim jeans.Ladies of all shapes 
 and sizes wear trousers.              
{Shoes}have four-inch stiletto heels   
 which make the girls very tall.
