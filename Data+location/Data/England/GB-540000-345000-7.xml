		<title>07Farming(2) in Leverton</title>
		<content> Years ago many animals were kept for  
 food and work.Nowadays only one farmer
 keeps cattle,sheep and horses.The     
 cattle are bred for meat as are the   
 sheep but the horses are Shires       
 primarily for showing.The cattle are  
 mixed breeds mainly continental       
 Charolais and Limousin crossed with   
 Hereford, Friesian and Lincoln Red in 
 order to produce good quality meat in 
 quantity.The cattle are shedded in    
 crewyards during the winter and on    
 rented grassland or the outmarsh      
 during the summer.They are fed on     
 silage and concentrates during the    
 winter but fend for themselves during 
 the rest of the year.The manure from  
 the winter shedding is eventually     
 ploughed back into the land to        
 increase the humus content and lessen 
 the need for commercially manufactured
 fertilizer.                           </content>
