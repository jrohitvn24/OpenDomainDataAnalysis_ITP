 The old turnpike road in this block   
 runs from Watts House to Handy Cross. 
 During the late 18h century coaches   
 rumbled along this road on their way  
 from Taunton to Minehead.             
                                       
 An interesting feature of this "Golden
 Age of Coaching" is the number of inns
 and watering places which sprang up   
 along the coaching routes. One of     
 these inns is the {Friendship Inn }   
 which is situated just east of handy  
 cross.                                
                                       
 We visited the inn on 18 July 1985.
