		<title>15CHANGING PATTERNS IN FARMING</title>
		<content> Problems of Hop Farming (based on a   
 local survey)                         
 Until the mid-1970's hop farming was a
 very prosperous activity and within   
 Kent was valued at over 5 million     
 pounds.Recently however,farmers have  
 been unable to dispose of their       
 surplus hops because of changes in the
 pattern of supply and demand.Local    
 farmers are finding stiff competition 
 from Belgian and German               
 growers.Particularly crippling is the 
 ability of the U.S.A. to overcome     
 tariff barriers.A further trend is the
 reduction in the small users of hops  
 as they are taken over by large       
 multiples.Furthermore there is a      
 general move from beer to lager       
 drinking which reduces the demand for 
 hops by up to 50%.
