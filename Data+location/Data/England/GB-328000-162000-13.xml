		<title>13    Birnbeck pier</title>
		<content>   Birnbeck is an island which lays    
 just off the coast in the north of    
 Weston.super-Mare.Traditionally it was
 used as a fishing base.Nets were      
 placed on stakes which were driven in 
 at low tide.When the tide came in fish
 were caught.But when the tide went out
 again birds used to steal the fish,so 
 two men were paid to stand on the     
 island and frighten the birds         
 away.The first pier between the shore 
 and Birnbeck island was built of stone
 in the 1840's. But the pier was       
 knocked down by strong currents.      
   The present pier was opened on June 
 6th 1867. It was built of             
 iron.Pavillions were built at the end 
 from grey limestone. It is still very 
 rare to find a pier which is built out
 to an island, as they usually just    
 extend into the sea.
