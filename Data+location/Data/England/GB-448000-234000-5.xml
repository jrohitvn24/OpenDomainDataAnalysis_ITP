		<content>    The Parish Church of St Peter and  
 St Paul was first started before the  
 Domesday Book of 1086 on the site of a
 Saxon church.   It is still much used 
 by the village though there are other 
 active churches: Methodists, Baptists 
 and Roman Catholics.   The beautiful  
 spire , which can be seen for miles,  
 is compared with two other local      
 churches in a ditty:                  
                                       
      Bloxham for length,              
      Adderbury for strength,          
      King's Sutton for beauty.        
                                       
    The Vicar conducts the following   
 services on Sundays:                  
    8.00am   Holy Communion            
   10.30am   Sung Eucharist &amp; Sermon   
    2.30pm   Catachism                 
    6.00pm   Evensong &amp; Sermon         
                                       </content>
