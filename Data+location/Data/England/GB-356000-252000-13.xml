		<title>13Pencombe-a rural population</title>
		<content> In our 12km sq block there is a       
 population of 149. This works out at  
 12.4 people /sq.km. Of these 149, 49  
 are children and young people up to   
 the age of 18 and another 16 are      
 retired people, leaving 84 people of  
 working age, not including 16-18 yr   
 olds and from the survey on employment
 it is known that 72 of these are      
 working either at full or part-time   
 jobs.                                 
                                       
 The age of the population covers the  
 whole range, being neither top heavy  
 with many retired people, nor bottom  
 heavy with many young families .      
                                       
 An interesting fact to emerge was that
 of the 100 adults, 51 or just over    
 half originate from Herefordshire.    
                                       
                                       </content>
