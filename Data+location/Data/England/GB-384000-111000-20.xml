		<content>    MOST PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN SHROTON    
 APPRECIATE ITS PEACE AND BEAUTY AND   
 HAVING FRIENDLY NEIGHBOURS. EVEN THOSE
 WHO HAVE RECENTLY MOVED INTO THE NEW  
 HOUSES ARE CONCERNED THAT THERE SHOULD
 NOT BE ANY MORE BUILDING IN CASE THE  
 CHARACTER OF THE VILLAGE CHANGES.     
 THERE IS SOME FEAR AMONG THE OLDER    
 RESIDENTS THAT THE ARRIVAL OF RETIRED 
 PEOPLE FROM MORE EXPENSIVE PARTS OF   
 THE COUNTRY WILL FORCE HOUSE PRICES UP
 SO THAT LOCAL PEOPLE WILL NOT BE ABLE 
 TO AFFORD TO LIVE HERE. THEY DO NOT   
 WANT ANY MORE HOUSES TO BECOME HOLIDAY
 COTTAGES. THEY ARE SAD THAT THEY DO   
 NOT HAVE THERE OWN PARSON OR A SCHOOL.
