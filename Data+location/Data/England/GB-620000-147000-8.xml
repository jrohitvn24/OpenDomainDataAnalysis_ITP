		<title>08     Religion in Barham.</title>
		<content>The parish church was named after St.  
John the baptist.It is known there was 
a church of some sort in Barham as     
early as 800 AD;it is mentioned in the 
Domesday Book.Records of rectors began 
in 1280.The earliest parts of the      
present building are from the 12th     
century.Inside you may find a 14th     
century font with a Jacobean cover and 
three brasses.One is said to be the    
earliest full length brass of a        
civilian in Kent.A window of St.George 
killing the dragon honours the         
signallers who camped on the downs     
during the Great War.Over 200 people   
can be seated in the church but only   
just over 100 attend services          
regularly every month.There is also a  
Methodist Chapel which is used by the  
Parish church Sunday School.The        
children spend an hour there,partly in 
separate classes,and in a service.     </content>
