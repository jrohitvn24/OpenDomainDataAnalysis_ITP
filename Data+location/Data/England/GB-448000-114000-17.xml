		<title>17A PUBLIC HOUSE</title>
		<content> The Farmer's Home.                    
 This building is now a Public House   
 and was built in 1380.Previously it   
 has been a bakery,a slaughter house,  
 and a farm house. This is most        
 probably where the name comes from.   
 The Brewery that owns the Pub is      
 Whitbreads. They sell beer,spirits,   
 wine and liqueurs.They also sell      
 snacks and meals.                     
 On the outside of the Pub ther are    
 three different types of brickwork.   
 This suggests that parts of the Pub   
 were built at different times. There  
 is a garden in which there is a swing,
 a slide and an aviary with thirteen   
 birds in it.                          
 Outside the Pub there are many objects
 from the past such as a baker's peel  
 from the bakery and a hand plough from
 the farm.                             
                                       </content>
