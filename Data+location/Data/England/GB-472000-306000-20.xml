		<content>{SILK GALLERY AT TILTON-ON-THE-HILL    
 A small village shop in Tilton        
 specialises in articles made from pure
 silk e.g. lavender bags,handbags,     
 cushions, silk flowers, blouses,      
 scarves, etc. These are collected from
 all over the world and some are made  
 by talented housewives both locally   
 and in other parts of the country.The 
 shop, or gallery as it is known, is an
 extension, formerly a garage to a     
 private house. It is built from stones
 from an old windmill which once stood 
 in the garden. It is filled with fine 
 old local country furniture which     
 makes an interesting background for   
 the silk goods on display. The        
 business has attracted great interest 
 both from shoppers and from groups who
 can attend talks on the history of    
 silk given by the owner.
