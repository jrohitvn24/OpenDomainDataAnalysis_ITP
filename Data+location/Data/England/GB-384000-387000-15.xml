		<content> IN OUR AREA THERE IS A SWIMMING POOL  
 AND A BOWLING GREEN.THERE ARE TWO     
 TENNIS COURTS,A FOOTBALL PITCH AND A  
 PITCH AND PUTT COURSE. BUT TO FILL IN 
 THE GAPS WE NEED MORE SPORTS          
 FACILITIES SUCH AS A ROLLER RINK AND  
 ICE SKATING RINK.THE ENTERTAINMENT IS 
 VERY POOR INDEED,WE NEED CINEMAS AND  
 THINGS FOR YOUNG CHILDREN SUCH AS AN  
 INDOOR PLAYGROUND.THERE ARE NOT VERY  
 MANY SHOPS IN OUR AREA.ALSO WE NEED A 
 NEARER HOSPITAL.ALSO WE NEED MORE     
 LIBRARIES AS THERE ARE ONLY ABOUT TWO 
 IN OUR AREA. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE
 IS NOT ENOUGH MONEY FOR ALL OUR NEEDS.
 COMPARED TO STOCKPORT OUR AREA IS VERY
 POOR.
