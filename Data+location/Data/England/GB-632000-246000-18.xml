		<content> R.A.F. Woodbridge air base occupies a 
 large part of this area.  It was cons-
 tructed during World War 2, in July   
 1942,as a recovery base for distressed
 British and Allied aircraft.  The Uni-
 ted States Air Force have had admini- 
 strative control since 1952. Currently
 based here are the 67th Aerospace     
 Rescue and Recovery Squadron, which   
 flies the HC-130 and HH-53 helicopters
 known s the "Jolly Green Giants", and 
 the 78th and 91st Tactical Fighter    
 Squadrons, both flying the A10        
 anti-tank fighter aircraft. The three 
 squadrons form part of the 81st Tac-  
 tical Fighter Wing whose home is      
 jointly here at RAF Woodbridge and at 
 nearby RAF Bentwaters.  The 81st's    
 total military complement is around   
 5000, some 1200 of whom are based at  
 RAF Woodbridge.
