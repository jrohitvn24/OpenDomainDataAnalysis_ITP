		<title>07HOUSING IN WESTCOTT</title>
		<content>   Houses in Westcott and Wotton vary  
 greatly in age/style/quality/price    
 etc. Prices range from{Â£42,950}for a  
 2-bedroomed terraced property to      
{Â£175,000}for a 6-bedroomed house with 
 swimming pool, tennis court and garage
 space for up to 9 cars.               
   A majority of those properties      
 offered for sale in June 1985 were    
 in the price range{Â£50-100,000.}Only  
 those people with high incomes can pay
 such prices and therefore not everyone
 can afford to live in the area.       
   A survey of opinion in{St Johns Road
{Westcott}asked the question - "What do
 you most dislike about living here?"  
 A common response to this question    
 complained about the lack of transport
 which prevented shopping trips to     
 Guildford and other main shopping     
 centres. People also complained about 
 traffic noise.                        </content>
