		<content> Boughton Mount Special School and     
 Adult Training Centre were            
 purpose-built about 25 years ago for  
 children and adults who are mentally  
 or physically handicapped, have speech
 difficulties, are partially hearing,  
 partially sighted, maladjusted or     
 epileptic.                            
 Mr Foster-Clarke, a local business-man
 and landowner, provided about 10 acres
 of land on Boughton Lane for the      
 County Council to build the school and
 day-centre. The old house called      
 'Boughton Mount' was torn down to make
 way for them.                         
 Children on the school roll in 1971   
 numbered 78; now there are 87. There  
 are 9 teachers and 1 head, 7 welfare  
 assistants full-time and 3 part-time. 
 The facilities have grown considerably
 since it opened, often through the    
 generosity of local people and groups.</content>
