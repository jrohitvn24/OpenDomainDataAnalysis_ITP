		<title>03BEDSWORTH FARM</title>
		<content> Mr Moakes who owns Bedsworth Farm     
 allowed us to visit his farm and      
 interview him.                        
 Bedsworth farmhouse was built in the  
 1600's and it was then known as       
 Beetleworth Hall.This building is     
 still used as the family home.        
 The farm has both old and new         
 buildings.The old barns are used for  
 keeping animals and the new ones are  
 used for storing hay and vegetables   
 that have been grown on the farm.     
 Mr Moakes has always worked on the    
 farm and took the farm over when his  
 father died.                          
 The farm now has twenty-five cows,for 
 beef production and seventeen pigs.All
 the cattle are sold at Stratford      
 Market during May and June.           
 Mr Moakes cannot imagine not working  
 on his farm and hopes that one day his
 son will take it over.                </content>
