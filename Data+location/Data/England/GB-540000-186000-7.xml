 There are several hospitals within    
 easy reach of our area where you can  
 benefit from up to date treatment.    
 Other medical facilities like doctors'
 surgeries, dentists and opticians are 
 scattered throughout the area and are 
 increasing in number. The dentists are
 well equipped so that any treatment   
 can be carried out as painlessly as   
 possible. The opticians, too, have    
 advanced, modern equipment to carry   
 out accurate examinations to find out 
 exactly the right glasses to give you.
 There are other important services    
 available. The District Nurse travels 
 around helping all sorts of people,   
 young and old. She gives treatment in 
 patients' houses, such as giving      
 injections. She often has to work very
 long hours.                           </content>
