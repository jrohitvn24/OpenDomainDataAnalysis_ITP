 pipes are mostly used for sewage      
 treatment.The Naylor group has grown  
 over the years.                       
  Clay pipes have been used for over   
 3000 years.They are used for drains   
 and sewers.A 1200 year old clay pipe  
 was recently discovered in            
 Mecca,Saudi-Arabia.                   
  The raw materials are   put on a turn
 table that produces the shape of the  
 pipes.It is then put into a fire clay 
 kiln.The kiln is capable of producing 
 1500m of pipe an hour.Then they are   
 put into a tunnel kiln to be fired.   </content>
