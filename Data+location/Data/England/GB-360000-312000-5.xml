		<title>05THE SUGAR BEET FACTORY</title>
		<content> The sugar beet factory is between     
 Admaston and Allscott.It processes    
 sugar beet brought in by farmers in   
 the surrounding area.This is an       
 important factory as the next nearest 
 sugar beet factory is in              
 Kiddiminster (about 35 miles          
 away).This factory works at full      
 capacity in the months from October to
 January , the rest of the year        
 utilises the beet collected in these  
 months.                               
 Although the sugar beet factory is the
 tallest building in this area, we were
 not allowed to go up the towers to    
 take any photographs, because of the  
 security arrangements of the firm.
