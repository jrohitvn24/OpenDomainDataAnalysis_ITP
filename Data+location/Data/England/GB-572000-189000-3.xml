		<title>03BASILDON NE: EDUCATION</title>
		<content> When Basildon was first planned, each 
 division of the area was to have its  
 own school. However, as Basildon was  
 the first home for many young people, 
 there was a baby boom, and schools    
 had to be built to accomodate these   
 babies. The result was that schools   
 sprang up all over the place.         
                                       
 The early schools were built with     
 classrooms around a hall, a hard      
 playground and a grassed playing      
 field. These soon became overcrowded  
 and demountable classrooms were       
 installed.                            
                                       
 Newer schools are built to the open   
 plan design without any division      
 between classrooms.                   
 In this area there are three infant   
 and three junior schools, and one     
 secondary school.                     </content>
