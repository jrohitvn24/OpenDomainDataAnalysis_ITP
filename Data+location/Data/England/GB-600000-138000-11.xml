		<content> Traditionally industry was connected  
 with farming; flour mills, wool       
 storage, sheep/cattle markets. This   
 picture is changing. New industry is  
 being encouraged. A paper factory in  
 Sth.Willesborough  supplies the Office
 trade. In Sth.Ashford there are two   
 group periods; post war, which is a   
 series of flat roofed concrete        
 structures, revamped and 'glassed' as 
 they have grown. Among these are      
 instant print, milk bottling, carpet  
 storage and tool making. The second   
 now consists of 150 or so modern      
 blocks pushing on to the flood plain  
 area of the East Stour. As yet, not   
 all the units are operating. Bearings,
 tyre storage, office furniture,       
 pneumatic pipe work, double-glazing,  
 brewing and car mnt. are covered.
