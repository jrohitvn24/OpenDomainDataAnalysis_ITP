		<title>17The M42 Motorway</title>
		<content> The{M42 Motorway}is being constructed 
 in l985 and it will pass close by the 
 villages of Barnt Green, Alvechurch   
 and Hopwood.                          
 It will link with the{M5}near         
 Bromsgrove and will extend north east 
 towards Nottingham.                   
 It will be very important for         
 transport but it has changed the      
 landscape drastically as some houses  
 and a farm have been demolished.      
 There has been much{local oppisition  
 to the building of the motorway but it
 has still been built.                 
 The intended completion date for this 
 stretch of the M42 is spring l986.
