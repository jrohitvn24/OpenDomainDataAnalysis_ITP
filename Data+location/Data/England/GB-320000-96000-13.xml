		<content> Most of the housing is Victorian or   
 earlier. Many of the houses have had  
 money spent on them in recent years &amp; 
 the area has a prosperous look with   
 some properties attractive enough to  
 be on a rural calendar. Some houses   
 are of cob &amp; thatch, others of local  
 stone with a slate roof. At the side  
 of the railway track are 2 semi-      
 detached brick houses out of character
 with the rest of the area, these were 
 formerly used by railway employees.   
 Chandlers Hall, the local house of    
 distinction, has now been skillfully  
 divided into several accomodations. On
 the road between Colyton and Honiton  
 there is a very isolated, attractive  
 modern house. This house is part      
 of a riding school complex. Another   
 isolated house with a good deal of    
 land attached is used as a boarding   
 kennel.                               </content>
