		<title>04INTERVIEW  Holworthy Farm</title>
		<content>  The family have nine horses for which
 there is a visiting blacksmith. We    
 were also met by many dogs when we    
 visited the farm, they were friendly  
 but seemed determined to round up the 
 car as we drove away.                 
 The livestock are fed on grass in the 
 summer and concentrated silage in the 
 winter.                               
 The farm is quite prosperous for in   
 addition to the stock they posses     
 three modern tractors and a cattle    
 lorry.                                
                                       
 The weather is fairly mild with       
 only the occasional snowfall in winter
 and compensation is available from    
 the government in the case of sheep   
 being lost.                           
 The farm itself is partially self     
 sufficient, relying on outside help at
 busy times of the year.               </content>
