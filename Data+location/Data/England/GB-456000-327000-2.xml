		<title>02MANOR COTTAGE BUNNY</title>
		<content> My name is Adam Sewell. I live at     
 Manor Cottage,12 Moor Lane,Bunny. Our 
 cottage is about 300 years old. It is 
 built with stone foundations and brick
 made in Bunny. Every morning in winter
 my Dad lights a fire in the sitting   
 room and in the dining room. When I   
 get up I go into the kitchen and make 
 our breakfast. If I drop a bowl it    
 would smash on the quarry tiles. The  
 stairs are very steep, there are only 
 nine stairs to the top. We have small 
 sliding sash windows so they are easy 
 to clean. My bedroom is in the eaves. 
 Before each door is a step as all the 
 rooms are on different levels. The    
 latch doors have ancient hinges. In   
 the sitting room there is a low beam. 
 My Dad has to duck to get under it.   
 The dairy has an old brick thrall or  
 shelf for cooling dairy produce. Our  
 house is full of antiques.            </content>
