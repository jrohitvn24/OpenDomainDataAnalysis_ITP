		<content> A{Geologist}came to our school and    
 told us about the{Geology}and the     
 plants in our area. There are lots of 
 deciduous trees and not so many       
 coniferous trees.On the north side of 
 the{river Yeo}there is lots of redland
 but on the south side of the river{Yeo
 there is poorer ground.The{geologist  
 brought three core samples. The first 
 one was soil(redland). The redland is 
 on the far side of the{river Yeo}and  
 railway. The redland has good drainage
 and you can grow crops well. The      
 second one was shillet(shale). It is  
 almost like slate. It isn't very good 
 for drainage and very crumbley. The   
 third sample was also from this side  
 of the river. It is hard clay and it  
 is good for growing grass but bad for 
 growing crops and clay doesn't drain  
 very well. So the farmers have to work
 very hard on their land.              </content>
