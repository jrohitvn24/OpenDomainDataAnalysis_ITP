		<title>07         Farming</title>
		<content> The farms we visited were Zion's Hill 
 Farm and Manor Farm.                  
                                       
 Manor Farm is over 400 acres (19      
 fields) and grows spring barley and   
 grass. They used to have dairy cattle 
 but now they only have beef. They also
 keep geese.                           
                                       
 Zion's Hill Farm is much smaller with 
 100 acres. 50 acres of it's land was  
 lost to housing. This farm            
 concentrates on cows and they have    
 100 mainly Freisian and Limousin.     
                                       
 Both farms use tractors - Manor Farm  
 has two 4 wheels drive ones to use on 
 the rough land. Both farms cut grass  
 for silage.                           
                                       
 Both farmers try to be as             
 self-sufficient as they can.          </content>
