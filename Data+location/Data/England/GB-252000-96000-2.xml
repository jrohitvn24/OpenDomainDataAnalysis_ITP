		<content> The area is dotted with detached      
 isolated farms surrounded by out      
 buildings. Most houses and old        
 buildings are made of cob, but newer  
 sheds are of building blocks or       
 corrugated iron with a corrugated iron
 roof. Close to each farm there is     
 usually a tall, steel silo for the    
 storage of grain or feed. Apart from  
 these the landscape hasn't been much  
 affected. The farm houses are usually 
 off the road, down a long track or    
 drive and are often invisible to the  
 passer-by. The only church in the     
 block is a now disused Methodist      
 chapel which is up for sale. Ashbury  
 Plantations are mainly coniferous     
 areas of well-managed woodland but    
 there are also some areas of deciduous
 trees which are badly run down and the
 trees are dead or dying. There are    
 also pockets of scrub or marsh.       </content>
