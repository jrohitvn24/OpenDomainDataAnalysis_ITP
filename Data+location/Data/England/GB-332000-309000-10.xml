 lives a mile up the road. As well as  
 being our dinner lady she does a bed  
 and breakfast service.She has had very
 famous people like Richard Whitmore   
 off BBC television.The average amount 
 of people she has in the week in the  
 winter isn't very many but in the     
 summer it can be 2 to 10 people a     
 night.It varies.The highest amount of 
 people she has had at any one time    
 were some people from Portugal and    
 there were 12 of them.The average time
 a person stays is over night but      
 ocasionaly they stay longer.Mrs Arthur
 has been doing a bed and breakfast    
 service for 6 years.She started up the
 bed and breakfast because she liked   
 meeting people and it was a good way  
 of getting an income without going    
 into town to work.
