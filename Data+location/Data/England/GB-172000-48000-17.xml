		<title>17Local history of St. Agnes</title>
		<content> In 1568 the Queen sold - among other  
 chantry lands - a tenement, garden and
 stable in St. Agnes.  This is believed
 to be "Penwennack", providing a house 
 and stable for the Vicar and a horse. 
 Tonkin gives this account of the      
 church in his Manuscript: "It consists
 of three roofs, a small tower and     
 spire with three bells, and when built
 was of a sufficient dimension to      
 contain all the inhabitants; but they 
 are so much increased that there is   
 much need to enlarge the Church ... ".
 The design for the enlargement was    
 approved in 1712 but nothing was done 
 except that the writer himself built a
 small aisle for the use of himself and
 his family.  In the windows of the    
 church was formerly painted the       
 History of the Life of St. Agnes - now
 only a small piece remains in the     
 south window.                         </content>
