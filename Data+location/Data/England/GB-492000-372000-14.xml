 New Farm is owned and run by Mr and   
 Mrs Russon and covers 320 acres. Mr   
 Russon also rents 129 acres of land.  
 They have a dairy herd of 260 Friesan 
 cows and a Hereford bull. Some of the 
 cows wear collars which shows the     
 farmer how much milk they produce and 
 how much food they need. Milking is   
 done twice a day at 6am and 4pm and   
 takes two hours. All the milk is      
 pumped into a 570 gallon tank and is  
 then taken to Boultham Park Dairy.    
                                       
 The farm also grows cereal crops such 
 as winter wheat, winter barley, maize 
 and grass. In the winter months 2,000 
 sheep come down from the Lake District
 to graze while the cows are in the    
 sheds.                                
                                       
                                       </content>
