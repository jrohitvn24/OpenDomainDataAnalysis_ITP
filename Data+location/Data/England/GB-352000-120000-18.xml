 of 10 and over,{run by the Vicar}and  
 two lady helpers.It is held in the    
 Church rooms{every Friday}evening.    
   We play many{games}like Cat and     
 Mouse and Wink Murder. For 15 pence we
 can have a drink of orange squash and 
 a chocolate bar.                      
   At Christmas,Easter and Harvest time
 we do{plays}to show what is special   
 about each occasion.Sometimes we go on
{day trips}to Minehead,Exeter or the   
 Quantock Hills.                       
   One time we held a{'Cider and       
{Sausage' party}and made up a special  
 Friday Folk Treasure Hunt for it.On a 
 map of the 5 churches the Vicar looks 
 after, you had to mark where you      
 thought the treasure had been hidden. 
 The treasure was 4 of the new one     
 pound coins but I didn't find it!
