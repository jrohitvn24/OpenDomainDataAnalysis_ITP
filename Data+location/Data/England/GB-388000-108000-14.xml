		<content> The Horse Chestnut Tree               
 Is a tree full of delights            
 It is big,big, a beautiful tree       
 It has many wonders                   
 Why it was planted out side the       
 church,                               
 How old it is, how big is its spread. 
 What it has seen in its long,long     
 life.                                 
 It has seen a party under its branches
 this year                             
 To remember Victory in Europe         
 Forty years ago.                      
 In the summer it has luscious green   
 leaves.                               
 In Autumn the leaves are a lovely red,
 golden yellow  brown                  
 They fall and crunch under your feet. 
 Then comes the conker with its hard,  
 spiky shell.
