		<content> There are no cinemas in this area, the
 nearest being 30 miles away at Durham 
 or 23 miles away at Hexham. There are 
 often film shows given by local photo-
 graphers in private houses or local   
 halls to raise funds for local activ- 
 ities or for charities.  There are    
 live theatrical performances at West- 
 gate and Stanhope once or twice a     
 year. Some people in the area belong  
 to a Theatre Club based at Stanhope   
 and buses from there take members to  
 theatres in Newcastle, Sunderland,    
 Billingham and Darlington.  A Music   
 Festival is held each June in St.     
 John's Chapel and several people from 
 the area help in its organisation and 
 some perform in it.  Concerts are held
 at High House and Wearhead Methodist  
 Churches.
