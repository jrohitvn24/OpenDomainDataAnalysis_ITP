		<content>     In an area where intensive pig and
 poultry farming is prevalent, one farm
 in our block concentrates on Barley   
 Bull rearing.                         
     Week old bull calves are bought in
 batches and group housed in large airy
 sheds. They are individually fed on   
 liquid calf_mix protein, and at 8     
 weeks are introduced to a mixture of  
 rolled barley, fish meal and black    
 treacle. On attaining the weight of   
 400 Kg at the end of approx. 11       
 months, the calves are ready for      
 marketing.                            
     To hasten growth, hormone bullets,
 supplied by a veterinary surgeon are  
 planted into the flesh behind the ear,
 2 months prior to killing.            
     This practice, appertaining to    
 poultry fattening, is now banned by   
 E.E.C. rules.
