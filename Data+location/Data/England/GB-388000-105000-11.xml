		<title>11Blandford - Carnival</title>
		<content> Every year in Blandford we have a     
 Carnival &amp; I have taken part in them  
 nearly every time.It is special to me 
 because it is only held once a year so
 when the time comes I am very excited 
 because people give you balloons and  
 sweets and it is fun to watch the     
 floats.People dress up and pretend to 
 be other people.Once I dressed up as a
 dwarf in Snow-White and the Seven     
 Dwarfs. {Louise Webb.(aged 8)         
 6th July 1985 The Chief Scout came &amp;  
 cut our anniversary cake.Did you know 
 that Scouting in Blandford is 75 years
 old? On Sunday 7th there was a pet    
 show &amp; disco.I entered the show with  
 'legomus parrotus' in the home-made   
 section.I won 3rd prize,Craig won 2nd 
 prize &amp; Robin won 1st prize.Later on  
 we had the disco I didn't dance,      
 instead I went outside,played'1,2,3   
 In'then I had a Hot-Dog.{David}       </content>
