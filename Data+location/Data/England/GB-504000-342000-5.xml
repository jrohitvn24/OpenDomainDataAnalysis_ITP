		<title>05MEMORIES OF SILK WILLOUGHBY</title>
		<content> Alice Brown remembers that{Silk       
{Willoughby}was once owned by the Earl 
 of Dysart, but was sold in the early  
 1920's.{Farm workers}had to rise early
 to feed the stock.  One could hear the
 clip clop of horses going down the    
 quiet country lanes to pull the       
 ploughs. Nearly every household       
 would have a pigsty in the yard and   
 would keep at least one pig, which    
 would be slaughtered at Christmas     
 time. She remembers the{village shop, 
 which closed in l968, and saw the     
 widening of School Lane and Gorse     
 Lane. Mrs Brown, who has lived in     
{Silk Willoughby}since 1918, misses the
 clang of the blacksmith's hammer, the 
 noise of the cows in the fields and   
 the horses cantering to and fro       
 bringing the harvest grain into the   
 farmyards.                            
 These things are lost to us now.      </content>
