		<title>15AN INTERVIEW WITH MR BASSETT</title>
		<content> On Thursday 13th June we interviewed  
 Mr Bassett. Mr Bassett had lived in   
 Frant for 72 years before he moved to 
 Wadhurst he has now moved to Wadhurst 
 for 5 years.  The Bassett family had a
 shop on the corner of the High Street 
 for 12O years. It changed to a        
 restaurant in 198O. In the time of the
 shop people used to order from the    
 shop and it was taken to the peoples  
 homes so not many people came into the
 shop each week. The shop sold         
 everything from oil lamps to loaves of
 bread. The furthest place that Mr     
 Bassett used to deliver was Eridge.   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
