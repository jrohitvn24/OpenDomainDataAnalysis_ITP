		<content> Barnet Road and Wood Street are mostly
 housing but there are one or two      
 farms. The most biggest of them all is
 Whale Bone Farm which is on the south 
 side of Wood Street. It starts more or
 less opposite Kings Road and stretches
 to the juction where Wood Street and  
 Barnet Road meet.                     
 At the junction there is also a pub   
 called Arkley. From there on the land 
 use is mostly housing but at the      
 corner of Field End there is the      
 Arkley Mens Club.                     
 After that we came to Quinta Drive and
 after that to the Arkley racing       
 stables. From there on there is a bit 
 of grassland, some houses and then a  
 church which used to be a school.     
 There are some more grassland and then
 some shops which include a car dealer 
 then its mostly housing to Barnet     
 Gate.                                 </content>
