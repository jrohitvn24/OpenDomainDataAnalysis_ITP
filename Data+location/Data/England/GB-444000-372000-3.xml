		<title>03The Miners' Strike.</title>
		<content>     One Tuesday in 1984 my Dad went to
 work at Markham pit. About half an    
 hour later he came back and said to my
 mum, "We're on strike".               
   My dad only got a little bit of     
 money from the Social Security. We    
 could not watch T.V. alot because of  
 the electricity bill.                 
   Dad took our dog on long walks for  
 something to do as he was on strike   
 for over eleven months. He could not  
 go to the pub a lot , nor smoke as he 
 hadn't enough money.                  
   Each morning my Dad would go and    
 join the picket line and earn Â£1 a    
 week plus the petrol money for taking 
 the other pickets to Orgreave Coking  
 Plant, so we had Â£10 a week. My Dad   
 went to the Strike Centre each morning
 for breakfast. There wasn't much money
 for Christmas presents but it was the 
 best Christmas Iv'e ever had.         </content>
