		<content>    In the 1950's people decided that  
{Byker}needed redevelopment.  The      
 houses were old, they had outdoor     
 toilets and coal fires.  In 1969{Ralph
{Erskine}was appointed architect and   
 planner for the area. He decided to   
 plan a complete environment keeping   
 the traditions of the area.  People   
 would be rehoused then brought back to
 their new houses.  The architects     
 wanted to involve people in the       
 redevelopment.  The houses have bright
 colours and different patterns and    
 type of brick.  The roofs are         
 different shapes.  Wood was used for  
 balconies and decoration.  There is   
 lots of green space to play in.  Old  
 buildings like churches and pubs were 
 kept.  Houses are heated by hot water 
 pumped from the refuse incineration   
 plant on Walker Road.  Byker is a nice
 place to live in.                     </content>
