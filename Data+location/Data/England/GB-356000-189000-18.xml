		<content> On the outskirts of Littleton at      
 Whalewharf is to be found an          
 electronics company .The company is   
 involved in the design, development   
 and manufacture of sophisticated high 
 vacuum and plasma processing equipment
 for the semi-conductor and associated 
 industries,throughout the world. The  
 buildings will occupy a total site of 
 250,000 square feet when development  
 of the site is fully complete. The    
 company has other sites in the United 
 Kingdom but it is intended that the   
 Whalewharf site should house a large  
 new headquarters and research and     
 development facility. Much of the work
 of the company, particulary at the    
 research stage, is highly confidential
 and secret and so it was not possiible
 to interview any employees.
