		<content>  The public house at the Offenham     
 ferry crossing is named 'The Bridge'  
 although no bridge now exists. The    
 public house has in the past been     
 called 'The Waterloo Tavern' but the  
 present name was introduced to        
 commemorate the footbridge which      
 existed there from the Middle Ages but
 which was demolished at least 200years
 ago. During the great drought of 1982 
 the water level dropped to the lowest 
 ever recorded and the Medieval        
 foundation stones of the pillars      
 became clearly visible.               
  Before the footbridge had been built 
 there had obviously been a ford in    
 existance as depicted by the name of  
 the Evesham side of the river-Twyford.
   The river depth at this point is    
 only some 5ft but it plunges to depths
 of 15 or 20ft withtin 100 yards.
