		<content>Norbury in the S.W. corner lies at     
three hundred feet and the ground rises
to five hundred feet along the ridge to
S.W.  The steepest fall in land is at  
Cackle Hill above Snelston and the     
banks opposite Church Mayfield.        
  There is a small artificial lake in  
front of Snelston Hall fed by a stream 
which runs on into the Dove.           
  Fields are nearly all grass, either  
permanent pasture or for silage and are
fenced with quick thorn hedges or posts
and rails.  There is some blackthorn   
as well.  Cutting and laying of hedges 
is still practised, an act encouraged  
by the "Young Farmers".
