		<content>     There was a big battle in         
 Ebberston village where a king was    
 killed. He was king Arthur (but not   
 from Camalot). There is a beck        
 which flows through the battle        
 field (as well as the main beck)      
 called the bloody beck. This is       
 because it was said to run red with   
 blood. He was carried along kings     
 lane, hence the name, and buried up   
 above the village. Near where he is   
 buried there is a tunnel, it is       
 supposed to lead to church house.     
   In all of the area the older people 
 are quite religous but the youngsters 
 are not.                              
     The main religion in Eberston is  
 C of E, but there are some Roman      
 Catholics.In Snainton there is a      
 Church and a Chapel.Reverend Forster  
 is the vicar of four Parishes.
