		<content> In my spare time I like to go down to 
 the river. In the springtime I can    
 fish for small creatures to go in my  
 pond. I catch tadpoles and silver     
 diving beetles. I don't enjoy riding  
 around Avebury on my bike because     
 there are too many tourists. There are
 many clubs at school like chess, clay,
 sports,gymnastics, computer and music.
 In the summer we can swim in the      
 school swimming pool.At sports club we
 sometimes play games like rounders and
 tip and run. I play tennis at home up 
 against the wall. In Avebury there is 
 a recreation field where we can play  
 football,cricket and most other games.
 There are swings and a slide to play  
 on as well. Avebury has a social      
 centre used by various organisations  
 like Brownies,Guides,Over Sixties, and
 Playgroup. Meetings of various kinds  
 take place there also.                </content>
