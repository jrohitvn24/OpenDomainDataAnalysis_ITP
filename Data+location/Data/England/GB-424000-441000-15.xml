		<title>15Bramhope: Interesting People</title>
		<content> Over the last 40 yrs,residents have   
 witnessed;road improvements leading   
 to increased traffic;the building of  
 many houses,two schools and a health  
 centre;and a change in shop usage.    
 One lady who has lived in the village 
 for 38 yrs,remembers how most of them 
 were situated by The Cross,another,the
 fields around Bramhope,many of which  
 are now housing developments.Elderly  
 residents are happy with the changes, 
 except for the traffic noise.Although 
 grateful for the travelling library,  
 would appreciate a permanent building.
 They welcome the weekly bus to a      
 nearby supermarket but would not like 
 to see one built in Bramhope.The      
 majority prefer Bramhope the way it is
 now. The absence of entertainment for 
 the young and the streetlighting in   
 some areas is offset by other good    
 amenities and the friendly community. </content>
