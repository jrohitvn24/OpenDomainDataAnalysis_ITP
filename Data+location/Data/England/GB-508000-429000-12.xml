		<title>12FITZROY ST. STATION : HULL</title>
		<content> Less than 100 metres from the busy    
 Beverley road and long forgotten by   
 the people of Hull,stands the main    
 passenger station of The Hull and     
 Barnsley Railway Company.             
    It is now over 60 years since the  
 last train stopped here and now young 
 trees  grow up the drainpipes and     
 weeds sprout from the cracks in the   
 brickwork.It was in a hole in the     
 wall that we found a nest built by a  
 pair of wrens.An old man told us that 
 a pair of barn owls used to roost in  
 the rafters before vandals had driven 
 them away by throwing stones.On a     
 summers evening bats can be seen      
 flitting in and out of the shattered  
 windows.                              
     Next month however,the demolition 
 men will move in and yet another old  
 building will disappear for ever.
