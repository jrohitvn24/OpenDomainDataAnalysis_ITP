		<content> Fashion today is forever changing.The 
 current trend is towards baggy clothes
 whereas earlier in 1985{ski-pants}were
 all the rage. Ski-pants are very tight
 trousers with elastic to hold them    
 down at the ankles .There are three   
 types of ski-pants, waffled, crinkled,
 and plain.{Bat-wing jumpers,}jumpers  
 which have baggy arm-holes, are worn  
 with the ski-pants. Another recent    
 outfit has been the{jump-suit.}A      
 jump-suit is an  all in one suit.They 
 are manufactured in a variety of      
 colours and styles, most with baggy   
 trouser-legs and sleeves. Shoes with  
 small and thin heels,{stiletto-shoes;}
 large dangley{ear-rings; neck-laces   
 with big beads are worn as accessories
 with the clothes of today.
