		<title>16THE RAILWAY &amp; IRON BRIDGE</title>
		<content> A railway used to run through         
 Bishopthorpe Village, and there was a 
 level crossing on Copmanthorpe Lane.  
 The track has now been pulled up and a
 cycle path is being laid.             
 The{IRON BRIDGE }is a railway bridge  
 over the River Ouse to the south of   
 Bishopthorpe.  It was first used in   
 1871 when the line from York to Selby 
 and Doncaster was opened as part of   
 the East Coast main line from London  
 to Edinburgh.  It was last used in    
 1983 when the main line was diverted  
 by Colton Junction to avoid the new   
 Selby Coalfield.                      
 It is 80m long and 7.1 m wide.  It has
 a moveable section 37 m long to allow 
 large ships to travel to and from     
 York.
