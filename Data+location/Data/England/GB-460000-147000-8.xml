		<content> Ther are five main places of worship: 
 two {Baptist}Churches - These are used
 for worship and as meeting places for 
 various clubs and groups.             
{Christ the King, Brighton Hill}- This 
 is an inter-denominational church and 
 is used by both {Roman catholic }and {
{Church of England }worshippers. The   
 hall is also used by the Brownies and 
 a playgroup.                          
{St.Leonard's,Cliddesden}- This church 
 is C of E and its bell can be heard   
 clearly from the Brighton Hill estate.
{St. Andrew's, Farleigh Wallop}- Once  
 a church used by the monks (and still 
 connected with the manor by a tunnel) 
 but now caters for C of E worshippers.
{Jehovah's Witness}followers are also  
 active on Brighton Hill and           
 hold meetings in their homes. Larger  
 meetings are held at Cranbourne       
 School.                               </content>
