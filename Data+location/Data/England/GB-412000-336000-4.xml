		<content> We are trying to find out what        
 services come into the village that   
 people use.Some of the services the   
 people use they depend on like the    
 coalman,milkman,breadman and mobile   
 shop.Some of the older villagers don't
 have any form of transport so they    
 depend on the bus services to go out  
 and go shopping(because the mobile    
 shop doesn't have a wide variety of   
 food,soaps and things that are used   
 around the house).The breadman comes  
 on a Monday and Friday.The milkman    
 comes on Mondays,Wednesday and        
 Fridays.The mobile library comes      
 every Friday.The coalman comes once   
 a week.The home help person goes to a 
 few houses once a week.The bus service
 comes every Monday and Friday.The     
 school bus picks up the children who  
 go to Hatton school and takes them    
 home from Monday to Friday.           </content>
