   Nearly all the land in our D-block  
is used for farming. This is a mixture 
of dairy and arable. When we did our   
land cover investigations, we found    
the primary cover was usually crops    
other than grass followed by pasture.  
The pasture was used mainly by cattle, 
with some grazing for horses and once  
only for sheep.                        
   We did a class survey of square 10  
with the mill in. Our 100 squares were 
covered like this - arable (mainly     
wheat or barley) 58; pasture 39; rough 
grazing 2; buildings 1. We think this  
is typical of most of the land around  
Marcham.                               
   There are also two big blocks of    
allotments.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
