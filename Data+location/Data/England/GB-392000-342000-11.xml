		<content>If the ball hit the kerb at the right  
angle it would bounce back to you.This 
was one point to the person who threw  
the ball.                              
     British Bulldog-any number of     
people could play this game.There were 
two dens and to start with one person  
is "on".This person tries to tick the  
other people as they run from den to   
den.As the person touches them,they    
also are "on".So each time it gets     
harder to reach the other den.         
     Kick the Can-is very much the same
as hide and seek.One person was on and 
had to count up to a hundred,everyone  
else ran off and hid.The person who was
on had to try and find the others      
however if any person could get back   
without being seen and kick the can    
over at the home base,that person was  
then "on".
