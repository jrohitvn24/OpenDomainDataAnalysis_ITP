		<title>09Transport in Frome</title>
		<content>{Railways:}It is quite easy to travel  
 to Weymouth because you don't have to 
 change trains. To travel to London,   
 Bristol or Taunton you have to change 
 at Westbury. Times are rarely         
 convenient.Frome has it's own station 
 on the south east edge of the town.   
{Buses:}Frome does not have a bus      
 station. Most bus routes come through 
 the town.  It is easy to travel to    
 Bath, Warminster &amp; Trowbridge but not 
 to Shepton Mallet or Wells.  Without a
 car it is not easy  to visit places   
 of interest around.  Some private     
 coach companies run trips infrequently
 to interesting places.                
 Coaches:The only regular service is   
 daily to London (National Express from
 Frome &amp; Roman City from Shepton       
 Mallet. Otherwise it means going to   
 Warminster e.g. for the South coast.
