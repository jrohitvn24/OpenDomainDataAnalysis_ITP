		<content>   One resident we interviewed said    
 that she had had a hard life. She had 
 often gone without shoes and eaten no 
 dinners at{school.}Those times were   
 hard but now she misses her           
 grandchildren.                        
   Elsie has enjoyed life at Dunmore   
 for 4 years and told us that her      
 favourite pet was a{toy poodle.}The   
 oldest male resident thought that     
 Matron treated him well. His favourite
 area is the garden where he grew his  
 roses. His favourite animal is a      
 spaniel and he shares a room with two 
 friends. Reading, walking and eating  
 seemed to be popular pastimes.        
{Dumplings and stew}were liked as were 
{fish and chips.                       
   Our stay was mixed with happy       
 thoughts of animals and songs and sad 
 memories of life changing.
