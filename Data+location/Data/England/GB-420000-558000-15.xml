		<content> Between 85-l50m the Forestry Commision
 manages mixed woodland much of which  
 was replanted l6 years ago on opencast
 reclaimed land. Hill Head Farm at     
 l86m, specialises mainly in hay crops 
 with some barley and meadow turf is   
 stripped off for direct sale to the   
 public for garden lawns.  The hay is  
 used to feed 37 store cattle which are
 sold in Tyneside auction mart,        
 Carlisle and Hexham, for slaughter.   
 Marshall Land's farm occupies land    
 between Whickham and Sunniside. It    
 specialises in arable crops with some 
 specialist fruit growing. In l985 a   
 Council nursery was established to    
 provide plants, for parks, gardens and
 public areas within GMB and           
 particularly for the National Garden  
 Festival to be held in Gateshead in   
 l989.
