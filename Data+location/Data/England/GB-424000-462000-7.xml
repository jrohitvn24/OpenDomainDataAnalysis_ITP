		<content> Another reason for the decline in the 
 population is that some of the farm   
 houses have been sold and the land has
 been joined to a neighbouring farm and
 with increased mechanisation fewer    
 farmworkers are needed. There is also 
 a lack of housing in this area. Two   
 years ago 10 houses were built in this
 village costing from Â£31.000 to       
 Â£88.000 for the four bedroomed house. 
 They were built from old stone        
 salvaged from an old mill and the     
 cavity walls have been insulated to   
 conserve the heat. We are short of    
 some low priced houses for newly      
 married couples and this might also   
 bring more children to our village    
 school.
