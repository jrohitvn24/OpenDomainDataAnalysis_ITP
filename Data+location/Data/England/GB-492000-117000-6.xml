		<content>   The society members are people who  
 are interested in the preservation of 
 records and artefacts which might     
 have been thrown away.  They get      
 things from people who live in        
 Graffham and someone who lives in     
 Fittleworth.                          
 They have old pictures, books, letters
 and even a shepherd's smock.  The     
 oldest items are the photocopies of   
 maps and photographs.  It is run by a 
 committee who all like historical     
 things.  They think that these things 
 must be kept safely so they do not get
 broken or stolen.  The idea for the   
 need for such a club was first seen by
 an old headmistress of the school.
