		<content>Most familys have at least one car and 
this is used to get to work and for    
shopping and recreation. There are     
some homes where mum cannot drive and  
so she relies on public transport if   
dad is not available. There is a good  
local train service into the city      
centre. This service is used to go     
shopping and to go to work. There is a 
reasonable bus service into the city   
centre as well. There are two types of 
bus. The red buses which come in to    
Birmgham from other near by towns, and 
the W.M.P.T.E buses which serve the    
local districts. Bicycles are a popular
form of alternative transport. Forty   
five percent of the children under     
eleven have a bicycle and local schools
in conjunction with the police, run    
cycle proficieny course in a bid to    
ensure their safety.
