		<title>09THERFIELD CHAPEL</title>
		<content> The Chapel was built in 1843 but the  
 interior was completely changed and   
 re-furbished in the 1960's. It is     
 attached to the Manse where the       
 present pastor,Rev. Allon Taffs,      
 lives.About 60 people attend Sunday   
 services regularly, only 6 from       
 Therfield, 50% from Royston,and       
 the rest from surrounding villages    
 within approximately a 7 mile radius  
 of Therfield. The majority are under  
 45,and there are 6 families with      
 school-age children. A mid-week coffee
 bar caters for about a dozen teenagers
 plus other young-at-hearts.           
  We want to share our belief in a     
 loving,self giving God who sent His   
 son,Jesus,to restore our broken       
 relationship with Himself.To this     
 end,the Chapel also runs a thriving   
 Sunday school and a Young People's    
 group in Royston on Sundays.          </content>
