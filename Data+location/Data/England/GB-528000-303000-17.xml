		<title>17A Day in My Life in Thorney</title>
		<content>   It's about{7.15}when mum calls me to
 get up. I always get up sleepy, but I 
 soon liven up. I then have a wash and 
 get ready for school. When I have done
 that it is about{7.45.}At{8.00}our    
 next door neighbour comes round for a 
 cup of coffee with my mum. While they 
 natter in the kitchen I go in the     
 living-room and watch TV. I always    
 watch 'Popeye'. When my next door     
 neighbour goes it is{8.20.}About then 
 my mum has to go to work, and I have  
 to stay on my own. When she goes I'm  
 still watching T.V and at{8.40}I go to
 school. I only have to cross the road 
 and I'm in school. When I get in      
 school I play for about 10 minutes and
 then the bell goes. As soon as I get  
 in I take my coat off and go in for   
 assembly. After that we usually have  
 an hour of maths. By then it is time  
 for break.                            </content>
