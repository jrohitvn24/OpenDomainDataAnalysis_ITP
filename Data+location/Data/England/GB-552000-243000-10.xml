		<title>10Hadstock Silver Band</title>
		<content>    The band was originally the Linton 
 Band until they went to war and some  
 of them didn't come back.  So they    
 made a band with the people from      
 Hadstock, and the people from Linton  
 wanted to join the Salvation Army, but
 the people from Hadstock didn't want  
 to because in the Salvation Army you  
 are not allowed to drink alcohol.     
    Mrs.Pring said that there are about
 thirty people in the Silver Band and  
 the age group is 8_60 years old.  In a
 contest they came first in one thing  
 and second in the hymn.  The          
 instruments include cornets, tubas and
 all sorts of horn.                    
    The band practises in the village  
 hall about twice a week. Sometimes    
 they come to Saffron Walden on the    
 Saturday nearest to Christmas to play 
 near the Building Society.
