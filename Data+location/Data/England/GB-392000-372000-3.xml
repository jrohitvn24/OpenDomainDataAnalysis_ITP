		<content>  There is a custom at the GOLF CLUB of
 employing caddies to carry round sets 
 of CLUBS for the players.The CADDY is 
 often a schoolboy who works for the   
 CADDY MASTER at the course,and is a   
 way for them to earn extra spending   
 money.                                
   The player asks the Caddy Master for
 a caddy and pays him around Â£3.60,of  
 that the caddy will get Â£2.70,the rest
 goes to the club.The boys usually only
 cover one round of Golf a day but     
 sometimes they are given a TIP and    
 even bought a drink.                  
  The boys job is to hand the player   
 the club he needs,carry the set around
 the course,look for any missing balls 
 and to rescue them from streams and   
 sandpits.A new trend has              
 developed-wealthier players now use   
 ELECTRICALLY POWERED TROLLIES-caddies 
 could soon be extinct.                </content>
