		<content>}In the Hackforth area,out of twenty-  
 seven children ten have home          
 computers. Eleven children have their 
 own television,nineteen have radios   
 and sixteen have tape recorders. Fewer
 children have their own computer      
 because they are quite expensive. Lots
 of children have tape recorders and   
 radios because children like listening
 to music especially pop music. Many   
 children have personal radios with    
 little head phones so that they can   
 listen to the music without disturbing
 anyone else. Quite alot of children   
 have their own portable T.V. Some use 
 the T.V. as the monitors for their    
 computers. No family has more than one
 computer. Computers are very popular  
 birthday and Christmas presents this  
 year. {CHILDREN'S SURVEY RESULTS 1985
