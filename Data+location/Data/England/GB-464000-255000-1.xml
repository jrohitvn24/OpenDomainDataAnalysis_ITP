		<title>01Bugbrooke area(Introduction)</title>
		<content>The area covered by this survey is     
dominated by the large village of      
{Bugbrooke},whose population now stands
at approximately 2600.                 
 Despite a recently rapid growth in the
size of Bugbrooke,the village has      
retained much of its original character
and many old buildings,including a fine
Norman church still survive.Although   
the village has both a primary school  
and a fine new comprehensive school,it 
does lack many of the amenities that   
a community of this size warrants.     
 The surrounding countryside has been  
put mainly to agricultural use (both   
arable and dairy farming).             
Several major lines of communication   
cross the area,including the railway   
link from London's Euston to the       
North-West,the A5 trunk road and the   
Grand Union Canal.
