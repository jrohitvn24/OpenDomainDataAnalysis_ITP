		<title>12Shabbington Woods-Oakley</title>
		<content>Shabbington Woods form part of the     
Bernwode Forest. It is mainly          
coniferous with some young             
oaks.Coniferous forests yield softwood 
timber,while the young oak (known as   
broad leaved trees) will eventually    
give us hard woods.The wood has a      
natural  meadow within it which is     
very rich in wild flowers,grasses and  
butterflies.In the woods there are     
lookout-towers for fires and deer,and  
also clearways known as rides,these    
help to prevent fire spreading also    
the trees are thinned out continually  
to give light to the forest and to     
prevent overcrowding.The Oxford Way    
walk passes the woods, and  Menmarsh   
point is on the boundary line.There    
is a local tale that somebody was      
hanged in the woods.
