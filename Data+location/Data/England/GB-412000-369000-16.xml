		<content>    Most Taddington families have cars.
 The older people mainly use the buses.
 They have passes and can travel half  
 fare.It is expensive for families to  
 use the buses.The teenaged boys have  
 motor bikes,but not any girls.A lot of
 children have bicycles,but they don't 
 ride far on them.                     
    To get to London now,you have to   
 change buses at Derby.You can get to  
 Mancheaster or Nottingham without a   
 change on the Trans-Peak buses which  
 are painted half blue and half green  
 with  woodland scenes on the sides.   
    The bus times are not really       
 convenient for getting to and from    
 work.The secondary schoolchildren go  
 on contract buses.We have several bus 
 stops but not one shelter,and we do   
 have a lot of rain.The Chesterfield   
 bus doesn't go through the village so 
 people have to go to the A6 for it.   </content>
