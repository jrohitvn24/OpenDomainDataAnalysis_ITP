		<title>10INFLUENCE OF PRIVATE CARS</title>
		<content>   For centuries this area was isolated
 by the nature of the terrain and dense
 woodland and a high proportion of the 
 population would spend their entire   
 lives in the same village, possibly   
 never venturing further than the      
 nearest market town.                  
  The coming of the{motor car}and the  
 improved road system have greatly     
 altered this pattern and there are    
 very few members of the indigenous    
 families left. The high prices paid   
 for even the smallest country cottage 
 means that the young people must move 
 out for their first homes, and a great
 many of the residents, if not retired,
 commute to Gloucester, Cheltenham, or 
 Hereford daily. Only a very small     
 proportion now work at home or on the 
 land.
