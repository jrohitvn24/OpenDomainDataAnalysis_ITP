		<title>10THE GLEBE SCHOOL.</title>
		<content> The school is an open plan school.It  
 is a Primary school but it used to be 
 an Infant and Junior until 1981.The   
 school is mainly built of brick and   
 has lots of windows. The roofs are    
 made of felt and covered in tar. The  
 roofs are flat,so if it rains very    
 hard the roof leaks.The school has one
 big playing field  and two yards.Also 
 it has two halls,the main  hall and   
 the Infant hall.There are 11 classes  
 in the school.The main subjects are

 History.We have lots of clubs like    
 sewing,drama,football,recorder and    
 book club.We have lots of computers in
 the school and we are setting up a    
 satellite link with a school in San   
 Diego U.S.A. We have music lessons    
 such as Violin,Guitar,Cello and       
 Brass.The school has 12 teachers,a
