		<title>04The Village of Buntingford</title>
		<content>  Buntingford is reckoned to be a      
 village, though now rather a large    
 one.It began to grow in the late      
 1960's, when Sainsburys built a       
 distribution depot here, with a large 
 housing-estate. Large private         
 developments have also occured.       
 Sainsburys are by far the largest     
 local employers.                      
  From Buntingford, people commute to  
 work in many parts of London and the  
 Home Counties. There is very little   
 Public Transport. Traffic is a        
 problem, as two very busy roads(A.10  
 and A.505) serve the village.         
  A By-pass is to be started shortly.  
 Its planned route has annoyed some    
 residents and conservationists.       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
