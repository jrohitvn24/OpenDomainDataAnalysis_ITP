		<content>  The area covered is attractive       
 scenically.The southern end of the    
 block is mainly flat and intensively  
 farmed but rises to a height of 411'  
 along the Felixkirk to Kirby Knowle   
 ridge,falling again towards South     
 Kilvington village.                   
  The land is productive but heavy,    
 overlaying boulder clay;mixed farming,
 arable and permanent grass.           
  There is good tree cover, chiefly    
 deciduous, with mature hedgerow trees 
 and several larger wooded areas.      
 Except in the flatter land around     
 Marderby Hall, hedges generally are   
 very good and not cut very low;       
 therefore they provide good cover and 
 nesting sites for song birds, smaller 
 passerines, and small mammals. Foxes  
 and badgers have been recorded and    
 hares exist in fair numbers.
