		<title>10Growth of the Village</title>
		<content>The village began to change consider-  
ably when the Bunbury Estate was sold  
off in 1914, from then on private      
houses were built in the area of the   
South drive to the old Hall.Houses     
were also built along Mill Rd. and     
Conyers Green.                         
Since 1946 Elms Close &amp; Cox Lane houses
were built.In 1965 Hall Park estate was
begun and is completed. In 1967 Conyers
Way was developed and houses in that   
area are still being built.            
In 1975 Barton Hamlet was begun. This  
development is actually in Pakenham but
people consider themselves Bartonians. 
Electricity was brought to the village 
in 1935\38. The first buses came from  
Bury in 1929. The village was put on   
the main sewer after 1945 when Thurston
Sewage Works was built.
