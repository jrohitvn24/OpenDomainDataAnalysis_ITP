		<title>11Living in Kirdford.</title>
		<content>   Life in Kirdford is fairly typical  
 of a Sussex village in the 1980's. The
 stable population of mixed ages live  
 in pleasant surroundings in a mixture 
 of owned or rented accommodation. The 
 employment level is quite high. 30%   
 work in Kirdford in agricultural or   
 service industries while the          
 remaining go further afield to places 
 like Horsham, Billingshurst,          
 Guildford and Pulborough.             
   The only bus service through the    
 village goes from Horsham to Petworth 
 four times a day consequently 81% of  
 the people surveyed owned either one  
 or more cars. These are used for      
 transport to and from work and        
 collecting essential supplies,there   
 being only two local shops. Almost    
 everyone enjoyed living in the        
 community because of its peaceful and 
 friendly atmosphere.                  </content>
