		<content>{   Clay Cross Works'}only competitor  
 for clean water pipes in Britain is   
 Stanton and Staveley.The Works used to
 make gas pipes as well until a new    
 plastic pipe was developed.They buy   
 the coke from the cheapest supplier.  
 This is usually local, such as{Coalite
 at{Bolsover.                          
    One of the main materials needed   
 for making the pipes is {steel        
{scrap.}They first melt the scrap and  
 pour it into a mould and spin it.The  
 faster the speed, the thinner the pipe
 is.The Works buy the scrap from scrap 
 merchants mainly in South Yorkshire   
 and Norh Derbyshire.Every 12 months   
 the furnaces have to be relined       
 because the inner is burnt out.       
    Recently some surface coal seams   
 that are 1 metre thick are being mined
 by bulldozers and lorries.
