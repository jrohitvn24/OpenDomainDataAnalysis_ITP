		<title>02EWSHOTT</title>
		<content>   As yet Ewshott is an unspoilt hamlet
 set in a valley among trees.The houses
 are varied but the majority with      
 superior standard with large gardens. 
   On one side of the village stands   
 the church, the old vicarage opposite.
   In the village is a well kept       
 village hall near an immaculate       
 recreation ground with swings etc. for
 children.                             
    There is one pub, a telephone and a
 post box.There are no shops, or a Post
 Office, or a bus service.             
   The nearest shops and other         
 facilities being at Crondall, Church  
 Crookham or Fleet.                    
   Unfortunately Fleet is gradually    
 creeping towards Ewshott.It is hoped  
 that Ewshott can remain a village.
