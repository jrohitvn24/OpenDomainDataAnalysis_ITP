		<title>05Shopping Questionnaire Data.</title>
		<content> The following points emerged from a   
 'shopping' questionnaire distributed  
 in Mattishall on July 10th.1985.      
    Most people questioned use the     
 local shops,but prefer to use larger  
 stores in Norwich or Dereham for their
 major,weekly shopping.The baker and   
 butcher are the most used local shops.
 Many people use the village shops     
 every day for small requirements.The  
 small Spar and Mace supermarkets have 
 the best choice of groceries and the  
 most competitive prices,but the       
 majority of those questioned prefer to
 buy groceries in the larger town      
 super- or hyper-markets.However,almost
 all agreed that the assistants in the 
 village shops are more helpful and    
 polite than their counterparts in town
 or city.Many people expressed the     
 desire to see a chemist's shop opened 
 in Mattishall.                        </content>
