		<content> Mr Willis is concerned about the      
 effects of{farming}on the{enviroment} 
 and because of this he has not cut    
 down the old hedges on the land:his   
 smallest field is just over 1 hectare.
 He uses mainly organic fertiliser at  
 the rate of 63 tonnes per hectare and 
 a little artificial at 1 tonne per    
 hectare.He is also interested in{     
{conservation}and has made two small   
 plantations and two pond.There are    
 moorhens and herons among other birds 
 on the ponds.Mr Willis and his wife   
 have 1 labourer in part time{         
{employment}daily jobs of feeding,     
 milking,and mucking out.Mr Willis does
 not think there will be any big       
 changes at the farm but his wife      
 sometimes tells him to sell up because
 he has to work so hard for the money  
 he makes.
