		<title>14'GROWING - GOING - GONE' !</title>
		<content> S.W.Corner:500080.A wide band of      
 cultivated grss land sandwiched       
 between wheatfields in the north and  
 oil-seed-rape in the south.The S.W -  
 N.E. by-road on the eastern side forms
 the heart of the village of Magdalen  
 Laver,a straggling settlement of      
 houses,farms and a nursery.The nursery
 greenhouses in use are of the modern  
 wide-span variety using an oil-fired  
 ducted air heating system.The stock is
 exclusively foliage plants for        
 indoor display.The older steam-heated 
 units hve been allowed to fall into   
 decay;a mute reminder of changing     
 market pressures &amp; the pursuit of     
 efficiency.The village school has     
 also succumbed to the issue of        
 economic viability.The school is now  
 a private residence and the children  
 now receive their primary education in
 the villg of Moreton 3-4 miles east.  </content>
