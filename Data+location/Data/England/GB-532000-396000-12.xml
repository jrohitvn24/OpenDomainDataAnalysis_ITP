		<title>12THE MOATED GRANGE</title>
		<content>{The Moated Grange}farm house is only 4
 years old.How long the old house stood
 is not known for certain,but we think 
 that it was built when the Domesday   
 book was being written.Mr P Smith is  
 the owner having inherited it from his
 father Mr A Smith.Previosly the farm  
 belonged to the Campions family.At the
 front of the farm there is a moat.The 
 end of which was at one time used for 
 dipping sheep.This is marked on some  
 ordnance survey maps as an ancient    
 monument.During the second World War a
 small contingent of RAF personnal were
 stationed on the farm to operate  a   
 radar station.The farm buildings are a
 mixture of young and old.The most     
 recent is a new drier storage bin     
 which is under construction.The farms 
 livestock consists of 130 cows,24     
 sheep,30 ducks,30 chickens,1 horse.
