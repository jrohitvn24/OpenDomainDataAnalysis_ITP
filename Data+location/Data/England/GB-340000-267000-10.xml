		<content>       VILLAGE LIFE BY A LOCAL         
 Mr John Keeley, now retired, has lived
 in Wigmore village all his life.  He  
 helps the community by operating a    
 hospital car service and had this to  
 say about the changes that have taken 
 place in his lifetime.                
 "I have lived in this village all my  
 life (over sixty years).  The main    
 difference in the village is that     
 younger people have moved to the      
 neighbourhood.  There is a very big   
 increase in transport and also in the 
 number of new houses but a decrease in
 facilities as there were four shops   
 but now there is only one village     
 store.  This has recently changed     
 ownership.  There are more small      
 businesses in the village."
