		<content>      The R.N. cemetry was built around
 the 1800's. It is well kept. It has   
 numerous graves and still has room for
 more.  There is a small chapel that is
 used for burial services. A case in   
 the wall contains a register of all   
 the people buried in plot D.  They are
 in the register because they do not   
 have gravestones.  There is a fenced  
 area that has the graves of foreign   
 sailors.                              
      On the gravestone there are      
 crests of the regiments to which the  
 deceased belonged.  The youngest      
 person buried was nine years old.     
      A large monument has been erected
 in memory of those who died in France 
 and Belgium. Also buried here are     
 sailors killed in both World Wars and 
 the Falklands.
