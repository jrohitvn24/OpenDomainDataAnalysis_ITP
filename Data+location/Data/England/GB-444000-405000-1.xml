		<title>01THURNSCOE - A MINING VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Thurnscoe has a bowling green, sports 
 ground and some swimming baths.       
 Thurnscoe is a{mining village}near    
 Rotherham. We have a good cheap bus   
 service to Doncaster, Barnsley,       
 Sheffield and Mexborough.  In         
 Thurnscoe there are two different     
 junior{schools,}Gooseacre and The     
 Hill, each having their own Nursery   
 departments. There is a Comprehensive 
 school which has tennis courts.  In   
 Thurnscoe on Mondays and Fridays there
 is a Market.  We have a{pit}but it is 
 reducing in capacity, so many jobs are
 being lost. Around Thurnscoe there are
 many corn fields. We have a flower    
 park there is a playground. There is a
 clinic and an old peoples home outside
 the park. Thurnscoes oldest school was
 Houghton Road, built soon after the   
 pit was sunk, it was demolished in    
 1984 after rationalisation.           </content>
