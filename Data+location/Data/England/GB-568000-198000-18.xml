 Mrs Kitchen the licensee of the Hoop  
 showed us a letter which was written  
 between 1790 and 1795.It came from a  
 girl's employer who lived in London   
 and enquired about the welfare of her 
 child.The letter was addresed to      
 Thomas Jarvis a local builder and it  
 was probable that he used it to plug  
 a gap while he was constructing the   
 tavern's walls.They had a very        
 pleasant beer garden equipped with    
 play gear. The Hoop is a lovely,      
 companionable village pub with strong 
 sporting elements as the head quarters
 of the Stock Football and Dart Clubs.
