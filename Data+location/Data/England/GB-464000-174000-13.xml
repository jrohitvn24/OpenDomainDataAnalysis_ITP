		<title>13FARMING</title>
		<content> The farming in our area is mostly     
 Arable but beef cattle are being      
 produced.The bulls used for the beef  
 are North Devons,which are not common 
 in Britain.                           
   The cereals that are grown around   
 Tilehurst are predominantly Rye but   
 other crops such as Corn,Wheat,Barley 
 are grown.All the Rye in Tilehurst    
 area is used for the crisp bread      
 Ryevita some of the oats are used for 
 Quaker porridge oats.                 
    The farms keep North Devon bulls   
 which they call the Devons they are   
 red in colour and have creamy horns   
 with black tips.Around our area the   
 milk from Devon x cows is olny used   
 to feed their calves not for the      
 milk-man.Devon cattle have a nickname.
 they are known as {RED RUBIES!
