		<content>  The few dwellings in the area cover a
 broad spectrum, ranging from a mansion
 house, Conholt Manor, to wooden       
 shacks, which were probably built as  
 weekend cottages in the 1920/30's and 
 are now used for permanent            
 accommodation.                        
  Most of the dwellings are privately  
 owned or are tied to a farm or estate,
 although there are a few council      
 houses on the outskirts of Upton.     
  The majority of the dwellings are    
 constructed of brick and flint. The   
 flints being available locally. A     
 number of the dwellings are thatched.
