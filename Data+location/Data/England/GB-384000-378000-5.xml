		<content> In order to solve the{traffic problem 
 Cheshire County Council intend to     
 build{by_pass roads}around Wilmslow   
 and Alderley Edge.The Wilmslow local  
 by_pass is about to come into the     
 County Council 5_year programme. No   
 date has been set for starting work   
 but the route is protected already    
 from further building.Alderley Edge,  
 however,is not in a firm programme    
 yet.It is regarded as a longer term   
 project.The local feeling about the   
 by_pass is that it is necessary and   
 since most congestion is made up of   
 traffic passing through,it should not 
 affect{local trade.                   
 Buses:The district is linked by road  
 to the Greater Manchester area by the 
 orange buses of{Greater Manchester }  
{Transport}and to the surrounding area 
 by the{green Crosville services.
