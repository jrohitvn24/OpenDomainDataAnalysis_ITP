		<content> In our block two villages are         
 separated by the{M4 motorway.}The     
 villages are{Stanton St Quintin}and   
{Kington St Michael.}It is mostly      
 countryside. The nearest towns are    
{Chippenham}and{Malmesbury.}There is   
 another village called Leigh Delamere,
 in{Leigh Delamere}there is a Granada  
 motorway service station which sells  
 petrol and there is a shop and a      
 playground. Most of the houses are    
 made of old stone and half have stone 
 slate roofs. Most of the farm land is 
 used for grazing cattle and some is   
 for growing crops. There are at least 
 3 big farms on the block. Just off the
 block there is an RAF camp. Most of   
 the houses on the camp were built     
 before the war. Most of them are not  
 on our block but some of them are.
