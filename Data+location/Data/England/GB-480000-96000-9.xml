		<title>09WITTERING FARM DEVELOPMENT</title>
		<content> Some farms have cattle,either Bullocks
 for meat(most of these are Herefords, 
 with perhaps,a few Fresians),or       
 Fresian cows for milk.Fresians are    
 particularly suited to the pastureland
 in this area,and the milk yield is    
 high.                                 
   Traditionally,many of the farms have
 been fairly small units run as family 
 concerns.However,as time has gone on a
 number of these units have ceased to  
 be farmed,as modern methods of farming
 have necessitated greater financial   
 investment,and have proved uneconomic.
 Several have been integrated within   
 larger farms,and some land has been   
 bought for housing development.
