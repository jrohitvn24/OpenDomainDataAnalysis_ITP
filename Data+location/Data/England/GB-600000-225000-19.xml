		<content> A major railway passes through our    
 area. The first railway line to       
 Colchester was built by Eastern       
 Counties Railway in 1843. The Eastern 
 Railway,and later the London and North
 Eastern Railway Station developed as a
 major centre for passenger and freight
 traffic.In 1962 the line to Clacton   
 joined British Rail's electrified     
 network when the full electric train  
 service began running from Liverpool  
 St.The overhead wires,carrying 25,000 
 volts, are now being extended to      
 Norwich and Harwich and will be       
 completed in 1987.The electrification 
 has now passed through Colchester and 
 bridges have had to be altered.       
 Policemen showed a film about the     
 dangers of electricity to local school
 children.                             
 Every weekday 230 passenger and 50    
 freight trains pass through the area. </content>
