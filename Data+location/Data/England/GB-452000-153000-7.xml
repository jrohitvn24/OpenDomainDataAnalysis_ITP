		<content> The Hannington Silver Band was formed 
 61 years ago in 1924 by Leslie Wythe  
 and his friend George Watts. Two other
 founder members were Reg &amp; Clem Wythe.
 It started as a temperance Band for   
 the purpose of accompanying the Meth- 
 odists in church, before they had an  
 organ. Mr Watts died in 1976, and Reg 
 died in 1983, but the other founder   
 members are still active in the Band, 
 along with their families, friends &amp;  
 villagers, who number 25 plus. All re-
 hearse weekly, still in the Methodist 
 Church.                               
 The Band does a great deal of charity 
 work, playing at summer fetes &amp; church
 services-especially at Christmas time.
 They have won many competitions, and  
 their uniform of green blazers, crim- 
 son bow-tie &amp; grey trousers are well  
 known in the area.
