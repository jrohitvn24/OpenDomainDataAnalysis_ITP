		<content>  The Sawbridgeworth Roman Catholic    
 Church used to be the Sawbridgeworth  
 Cinema. It was purchased by the       
 Diocese of Westminster in the early   
 fifties. Previously, in November 1950,
 Mass had been said in a room at the   
 White Lion (pub) or the Memorial Hall.
 A lot had to be done to make the      
 Cinema into a Church. First, the roof 
 had to be built again because it was  
 too heavy for the walls. In September 
 1967 the Altar and Church were        
 dedicated to Bishop Christopher       
 Butler. The name of the Roman Catholic
 Church was Most Holy Redeemer. There  
 was also a porch added on. The Roman  
 Catholic Church has not yet got a     
 graveyard.
