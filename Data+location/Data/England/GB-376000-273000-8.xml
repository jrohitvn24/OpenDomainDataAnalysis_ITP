		<title>08INTERESTING PEOPLE (BEWDLEY)</title>
		<content>  {Cyril Garbett}is well known and     
 liked by most people in Bewdley. He   
 is often seen in the streets chatting 
 and telling jokes. He was born in Lax 
 Lane, in 1913.{Stanley Baldwin,}      
 Britain's Prime Minister in the 30's  
 lived just down the road. Cyril left  
 Lax Lane National School at 13 and    
 worked in a mill at Kidderminster.    
 Often he had to walk the 3 miles to   
 work to light all the gas lamps. Often
 Bewdley was flooded and Cyril would   
 rescue people in the council boat. He 
 failed his medical during World War II
 so was the town's{ARP man.}After the  
 war and until his early retirement,   
 through an accident, he was the local 
 refuse collector. Cyril still thinks  
 Bewdley is a beautiful place to live  
 in but despairs of all the litter that
 visitors leave lying about.
