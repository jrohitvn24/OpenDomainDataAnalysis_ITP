		<content> The village place name means          
 'homestead of Peoda's people'. Signs  
 of how people lived in the past are   
 all around us. Fields unploughed since
 the enclosure show the ridges and     
 furrows of the open field system. The 
 field behind Beeches Farm is marked by
 ditches and raised areas. Some of     
 these may be evidence of an Iron Age  
 fort, while others show the site of   
 one of the two manor houses, the other
 having been opposite the Church. On   
 the hillside north of the village can 
 be seen medeival house platforms each 
 side of a road. The thatched house was
 a slaughterhouse and butcher's shop.  
 The house called Spencerdene was a    
 pub. Two of the cottages next to The  
 Homestead were the bakehouse and the  
 tailor's house. Nearly every house had
 its own pump and well. Many of these  
 still exist.                          </content>
