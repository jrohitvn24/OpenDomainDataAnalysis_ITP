		<content>      This is very much an{Upland Area.
 The land rises to a high point of{412 
{metres}at the{triangulation point}on  
{Treborough Common}in the South West of
 the block.    Much of the area however
 is over 200 metres high               
      This upland area is cut through  
 by a very steep sided valley which    
 starts in the South and runs through  
 all the eastern squares of the block. 
 This valley has consdierable interst  
 for{industrial archaeologists}as it   
 carried{the Mineral Line}much         
 used when this part of the{Brendons   
 was an important{mining centre.       
      The wet and very misty weather is
 now too often a feature of this area.
