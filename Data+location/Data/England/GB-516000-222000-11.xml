		<title>11MY LIFE IN LANGLEY-DANIEL</title>
		<content> A day in the life of Daniel.          
 I wake up at 7.00am. I get up and put 
 my radio on and then get dressed and  
 go and let the dog in.  I have my     
 breakfast,usually Weetabix,and at 7.30
 I go over to the pub "The Farmer's    
 Boy" in Langley to do my Saturday job.
 I do odd jobs like filling up the     
 shelves,taking out empty bottles and  
 sweeping the floor.I finish about     
 10.00am and get paid Â£4.Then I go home
 and Mum takes me dry skiing in the    
 afternoon at Stanborough Park,  Welwyn
 Garden City.That's good fun.When we   
 get home we have lunch.My favourite is
 chips. Sometimes I play on my bike in 
 the afternoon or I might take my dog  
 out for a walk. She is a red setter   
 called Corrie.In the evening I watch  
 TV and at about 9.00pm I go to bed.
