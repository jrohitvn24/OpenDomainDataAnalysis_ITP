		<content> Farming in the area is a mixture of   
 beef and dairy cattle, sheep, pigs and
 poultry.  There is a fish farm for    
 breeding trout to stock farms for     
 competitive fishing.  Hay is grown to 
 feed stock over the winter together   
 with barley, oats and corn for cereal.
 there is some oil seed rape produced  
 as cattle feed but virutally no root  
 crops are grown                       
                                       
 The majority of farms are small       
 between 3O and 8O acres with the      
 largest being no more than 2OO acres. 
                                       
 Hubbards Farm in Ashby Magna is run as
 a Government Youth Training Scheme in 
 order to train young people between   
 the ages of l6 and l8 to work in the  
 farming industry.
