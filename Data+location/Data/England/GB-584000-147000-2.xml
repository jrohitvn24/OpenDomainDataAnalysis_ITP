		<content> In autumn there are the lovely{apples 
 with the brown leaves with the orange 
 sunsets shining over the cut corn     
 fields;in winter the snow brings fun  
 ,as the area is just outside the{weald
 which is very hilly on the{north downs
 .The downs make great tobogganing and 
 as it's in the east the snow comes    
 down heavily!                         
      There are many old houses dating 
 back to{'tudor'}times and a lot of    
 new ones!There are ponds scattered    
 everywhere,so it is a good area for   
 fishing.A good point is that there are
 not fumes and lots of towns but there 
 are odd villages scattered around here
 in the beautiful {garden of England.
