		<title>01The Aire Valley Landscapes</title>
		<content> Our area contains both urban and rural
 landscapes. The town of Bingley is    
 situated in a valley which is the main
 roadway to the Yorkshire Dales. The   
 town has a good shopping area,        
 pleasant houses and old mill buildings
 which are now used for other          
 commercial interests. A few minutes   
 drive from the centre of Bingley      
 brings you into local villages which  
 are surrounded by woodland, parks and 
 moorland. There are many old buildings
 of historical and architectural       
 interest for the visitor. The river   
 Aire runs through one side of the     
 valley alongside the main road and    
 railway. While at the other side we   
 have the Leeds and Liverpool canal    
 with its famous Five Rise Locks. It is
 a very enjoyable and interesting place
 to live.
