		<title>13GOLDHANGER - FISH STREET</title>
		<content> Fish Street is called Fish Street     
 because about 200 years ago fish was  
 carried along it from the river.Fish  
 Sreet leads from the Creek to the     
 Square.N02 Fish Street used to        
 be the only bakery in Goldhanger.It   
 has a large bay window and extension  
 at the back. The front of the house   
 has horizontally hung boards.         
 Next to the bakery is a house with the
 date 1720 above the door.The walls are
 lined with wattle and daub plastering.
 The "Creek",next door is a post war   
 built house similar in style to the   
 older ones.Most of the roofing tiles  
 in Fish Street are hand made.         
        My general impression of Fish  
 Street is of a quiet lane where the   
 new and old houses blend perfectly    
 together.It is well worth a visit and 
 would prove a most rewarding stroll   
 for anyone interested in architecture.</content>
