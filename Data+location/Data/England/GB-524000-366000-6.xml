		<content> Crops such as wheat, sugar beet and   
 cabbage are grown here. Horses,       
 ponies, sheep, cows and deer are      
 found. There are many deciduous trees 
 in small coppices. They could once    
 have been joined together to form a   
 huge forest, but parts were cut down  
 to make way for roads and fields.     
 There is only one amenity, a post box.
 Sonvelsby Court was built in 1575 and 
 has 14 rooms. It is the second house  
 to be built the first was burnt       
 down.The court has some stained glass 
 windows and some valuable treasures.  
 The park is 1600 acres. Black fallow  
 deer have been kept for 300-400 years 
 in addition to the 30 cows and 1000   
 sheep. There is a mound which was the 
 old refrigerator. Ice from the moat   
 was stored there to keep food cool. It
 was linked by passage to the kitchen. 
 There are fish in the moat.           </content>
