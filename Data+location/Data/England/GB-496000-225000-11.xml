		<title>11THE SUPERNATURAL, HOCKLIFFE</title>
		<content> On the main kitchen window, in the    
 bottom left hand corner on the outside
 of{Hockliffe House}there are two      
{handprints}stretched out as if someone
 is trying to get in.  The{prints}can  
 only be seen in a{full moon at        
{midnight. }The owner has              
 unsuccessfully attempted to remove    
 them. She was told of their existence 
 by an elderly servant, who had seen   
 the{prints.  One theory}of their      
 origin is that in the days when the   
 house was a hospice so many sick      
 people tried to gain admittance some  
 had to be turned away and hence the   
{handprints}on the window.{A second    
{theory}is that the church refused to  
 bury the diseased inmates of the      
 hospice and so they were buried in the
 grounds.  Could it be something       
{supernatural} that tries to gain      
 admittance{from beyond the grave?}    </content>
