		<content> The Kidderminster Harriers Football   
 Club has had its stadium at Aggborough
 since the late 19th Century.          
 The Club enjoyed its most successful  
 period in the years following the     
 First World War, when the 7th         
 Worcester's side became almost the    
 Harrier's side.                       
 Perhaps the most famous Harrier who   
 actually played for the side was Teddy
 Peers, the Welsh International        
 goalkeeper, who joined the club in    
 1923.                                 
 Attached to the ground at Aggborough  
 is the Kidderminster Harriers Social  
 Supporters Club. It resembles a       
 working men's club and has a strong   
 tradition of family attachment.       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
