		<title>10Church, Ashford Carbonell</title>
		<content>  The name of Ashford Carbonell church 
 is St. Mary Magdalene.The bell tower  
 is made of wood and set on the west   
 side of the church.Ashford Carbonell  
 church is very old because it was here
 in Norman times, and since then it has
 been repaired and altered .The church 
 is made of stone and wood, but when it
 was first built we think it was made  
 of only wood.At the back of the church
 there is a stained glass window shaped
 like an eye, as though it is God's eye
 and He sees through it.The stone      
 around the windows and arch is shaped 
 in a way so that it is smooth and     
 flat.The rest of the church is also   
 made of stone but that does not look  
 as smooth.At the back of the church is
 an iron grave which is covered in rust
 and all overgrown. Everyone thinks it 
 is a witch's grave.                   
                                       </content>
