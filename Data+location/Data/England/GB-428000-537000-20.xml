		<content> We have been unable to complete the   
 survey to our satisfaction.We have not
 been able to take the photographs     
 because of a ban on out of school     
 activities whilst the teachers' unions
 have been attempting to achieve a just
 reward for their members'efforts.     
 We have suffered considerable hardship
 in this area throughout the year of   
 the miners'strike when many of our    
 families have suffered privation.I    
 feel that to omit mentioning these    
 events would be a most serious        
 omission for events such as these are 
 a significant indication of the state 
 of this country in 1985.              
 Our neighbourhood comprehensive school
 closes today-a further spur to out    
 migration.We no longer have a waiting 
 list for council houses and no pit    
 remains in the Durham constituency.
