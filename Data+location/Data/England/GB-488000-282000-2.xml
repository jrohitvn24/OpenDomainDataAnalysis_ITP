		<content>At the moment of writing, Geddington   
CofE Primary School is on a split site.
The Juniors in the Victorian building  
next to the Church and the Infants in  
mobile classrooms on the recreation    
field next to the Village Hall.        
A new Primary School for 150 children  
is being constructed in Wood Street    
using the old infant building as the   
school hall. There are 5 full time     
teachers, of whom one is the Head, and 
a part-time teacher who lives in the   
village.                               
114 children attend the school. All    
live in the village, except for 8      
children from Warkton, Grafton         
Underwood and Boughton House.
