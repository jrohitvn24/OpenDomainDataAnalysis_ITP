		<content>   Edington and Coulston are just two  
 of many small villages tucked under   
 the northern escarpment of the        
 Salisbury Plain.They grew on the      
 spring line,making ideal trading      
 places for the hill farmers from the  
 plain and the lowland farmers to the  
 north.The fresh spring water was used 
 for washing fleeces and for turning   
 mills for grinding corn. Today the    
 lowland farms remain, with names like 
 Hudd's Mill and Ivy Mill, but the     
 majority of farms from the plain have 
 vanished with the take over by the    
 army for manoevres.Edington itself    
 has a fine 14c.Priory Church,visited  
 by thousands every year,built  as the 
 home for the Bonhommes monastic order.
 The landscape is dominated by the     
 plain escarpment,resembling a         
 steep,ploughed,field,eroded by many   
 small,dry valleys.                    </content>
