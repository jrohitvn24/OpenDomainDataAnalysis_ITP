		<title>16Jenny's Day (aged 9)</title>
		<content> It is Saturday June 15th 1985.        
 No school today which is sad, because 
 I like school.  Nevermind, Uncle Bob  
 is up from London for the weekend and 
 we always have fun with him.  I get up
 at 7, Corn Flakes for breakfast, wash,
 brush teeth and get ready to meet the 
 coach. There are hugs and kisses for  
 me and my two sisters. Mum and Dad    
 have prepared a nice meal for him and 
 he brought some wine. That is the bit 
 I like best. What a lovely day we had.
 My Uncle Bob is so funny and we had a 
 laugh when he fell asleep in the arm  
 chair and his glasses twisted around  
 his nose. He looked like Eric         
 Morecambe. Jill my sister laughed so  
 much that he woke up and chased us    
 around the room. After tea it was time
 for bed. We were told off for talking 
 and giggling.
