		<content> Since the closure of the village      
 school the Women's Institute is the   
 only meeting place for the women of   
 the surrounding area, providing a     
 chance to meet and discuss a wide     
 range of subjects. Visiting speakers  
 cover hobbies and topics of interest. 
 The W.I. helps a newcomer to get to   
 know her neighbours. We join up with  
 larger groups throughout the county to
 play badminton, bowls, scrabble and   
 bridge; we are kept busy learning     
 upholstery and cake icing; we organise
 trips to the theatre, even put on our 
 own plays. Our talented members can   
 arrange flowers,sew, paint, cook and  
 even spin their own yarns.  The       
 Institute also helps to organise a    
 youth club and informal socials for   
 the older people in the area,         
 providing a focal point for the whole 
 community.                            </content>
