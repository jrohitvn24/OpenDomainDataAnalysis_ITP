		<title>13Farming in our area.</title>
		<content>  Most farms are about 1000 acres of   
land and cattle are kept for milk and  
beef. About half the farmland is used  
for grazing and the rest of the        
farmland is used for crops such as     
barley,oats and wheat. Eastbrook Farm  
(Bishopstone) has one field of         
daffodils. Mr.Peploes farm at Idstone  
has 1178 pigs and 393 cows.            
  The steepest slopes of the combs are 
only used for rough grazing for cattle 
and sheep. The wooded areas are used as
windbreaks but were, in the past, used 
as winter shelters for cattle. The     
names of the farms of our study in     
Ashbury are College Farm,Kingstone Farm
and Manor Farm. In Idstone there are   
Elm Tree Farm, Rectory Farm and Idstone
Farm. At Bishopstone the farms are     
called Forty Farm,Eastbrook Farm,Manor 
Farm,Cue's Farm and Prebendal Farm.Most
were leased to farmers by the church   </content>
