 Situated along the Dee Estuary are the
 marshes, once a sandy bay.In 1928     
 people planted Spartina Grass to bind 
 the sand together. It spread rapidly  
 along the shore.Now it is just marshy 
 ground used for swimming, walking,    
 birdwatching, fishing and many other  
 activities.Children sometimes take    
 their remote control boats to sail in 
 the gullies.Every winter 154,000 birds
 come to the marshes.Here is a         
 selection - Red Shank, Tern, Shell    
 Duck, Heron, Black Headed Gull, Oyster
 Catcher and Reed Bunting.People go    
 fishing down on the marshes and they  
 sometimes catch crabs and eels.Each   
 Spring and Autumn we have a high tide.
 There are a few people living in      
 bungalows along the estuary and they  
 have to have sandbags ready in case of
 a high tide.                          </content>
