		<title>13THE BIKE DEBATE. PRO.</title>
		<content>{FOR.}At Silvington there is a moto    
 cross grass track. There is a little  
 coppice in the field and you have to  
 go through the brook at two points.   
 Matthew is in the Wyre Forest         
 moto cross club. There are some very  
 deep holes and there you have to keep 
 in a low gear. Matt came off twice in 
 "the bog" which is the most difficult 
 section of the course. Matthew writes,
 "People say that moto cross is        
 dangerous and people are killed but   
 its not true. People kill themselves  
 on the roads but in moto cross I wear 
 protective gear. Your bike is checked 
 when you sign in. A well organised    
 club event is safe . I wear boots with
 plastic shin guards. I wear a chest   
 protector and a body belt."           
    Susan lives near the course and has
 seen riders from 4 years to 20 years  
 old motor cycle racing.               </content>
