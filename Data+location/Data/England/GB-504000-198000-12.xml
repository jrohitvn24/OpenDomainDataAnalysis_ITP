		<content> For over a decade the{M25}has been    
 carved out of the countryside in this 
 area. First the stretch from Maple    
 Cross to Watford opened about 8 years 
 ago, and now the stretch to by-pass   
 Watford and join up with the eastern  
 section at South Mimms. A traffic     
 census was carried out on the first   
 section and it was found that around  
 mid-day 4200 vehicles were using the  
 road in both directions in a ratio of 
 approximately 3 to 1 cars to heavy    
 goods vehicles.                       
{ASBESTOS WORRY}                       
 When the workmen were digging out the 
 earth for the main M25 route they     
 discovered some asbestos.Langleybury  
 people signed a petition to show their
 concern.This type of asbestos is not  
 as dangerous as the blue dust asbestos
 and an M25 foreman said it had been   
 buried in a pit 60 feet deep nearby.  </content>
