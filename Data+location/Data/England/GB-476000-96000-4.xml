		<title>04WEST WITTERING CHURCH</title>
		<content>   West Wittering,the most South West  
 point of Sussex,has grown up unusually
 North of its ancient church which     
 basically dates from c. 1200,though   
 the font dates from the earlier       
 building on the site.                 
   In the Middle Ages the church       
 contained a relic of St. Richard,the  
 popular saint of Chichester,and some  
 interesting graffiti survive in the   
 South Chapel where this was located   
 until it was destroyed at the         
 Reformation.The most interesting      
 feature of the Church is the Lily     
 Crucifix,which is unique to England,  
 and of which only a few examples      
 remain.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
