		<title>06HATTON PARK RESIDENTIAL AREA</title>
		<content> Hatton Park is the most expensive     
 residential area of Wellingborough,   
 consisting of mostly large houses     
 built at the turn of the last century.
 The owners of these houses are        
 economically successful, professional 
 men, such as doctors, lawyers and bank
 managers, who have reached the peak of
 their careers.                        
 The obvious thing about this area is  
 the great seclusion of each house from
 not only the roads but also from the  
 other houses; it therefore lacks      
 atmosphere and any sense of community 
 spirit. There is very little traffic  
 or pedestrians and no shops to serve  
 the needs of the residents who have to
 travel into the town centre to buy    
 their goods, but one can assume that  
 as they all own expensive cars, this  
 poses little difficulty.
