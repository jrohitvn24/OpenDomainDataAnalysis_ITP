		<title>16CHURCHES IN PULBOROUGH</title>
		<content> There are three churches in the       
 village ;United Reform,R.C.,and the   
 Anglican Parish Church of St.Mary.Much
 restoration work is currently in hand 
 at St.Marys. The patron of the living 
 Lord Egremont has commended an appeal 
 fund this year. A team of young men   
 engaged on the government's Youth     
 Training Scheme are working under a   
 skilled foreman to carry out much of  
 the work.They supply the labour while 
 the church pays for the materials.The 
 table tombs, churchyard wall &amp; lych   
 gate need rebuilding,paths relaying   
 water supplied for a new toilet       
 facility,a ramp provided for wheel    
 chair access and gas connected for a  
 new boiler.In the church,the roof     
 requires attention and the brasses are
 in need of restoration.They hope to   
 raise Â£20,000 to restore the church   
 for future generations to enjoy.      </content>
