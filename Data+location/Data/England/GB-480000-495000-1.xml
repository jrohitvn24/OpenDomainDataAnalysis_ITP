		<title>01Forest &amp; Moor E of Wheeldale</title>
		<content> This block is mainly rolling heather  
 moorland but the southern half has    
 mainly been planted with conifers so  
 forest makes up about half the block. 
 The east is bounded by the deep gorge 
 of Northdale Scat along which runs the
 north York moors railway, road access 
 is limited to Wheelelab Road which    
 becomes a dirt track, and a few other 
 tracks used by foresters.   There is a
 small amount of farming (sheep &amp;      
 cattle grazing) and some sheep graze  
 the the moorland edge.   The few      
 residents are farmers.  Tourists visit
 the area,but the lack of roads deter  
 larger numbers of drivers.   Walking  
 in the area is popular because the    
 scenery is quite interesting and the  
 population is very low.   There is a  
 quite well preserved stretch of old   
 Roman road in the NW.
