  The area bounded by the villages of  
 Alderton and Toddington lies at the   
 foot of the Cotswold escarpment near  
 the ancient Saxon borough of          
 Winchcombe. It is a flat area of      
 fertile land forming the edge of the  
 Vale of Evesham, noted for its fruit  
 and vegetable production. The flatness
 of the land is relieved by several    
 high and isolated limestone outcrops  
 the most notable being Bredon Hill.   
   The area is mainly agricultural but 
 there is a small industrial estate at 
 Toddington and a large hauliers at    
 Gretton Fields. It is typical of rural
 Gloucestershire with picturesque      
 villages of Cotswold stone houses and 
 churches.
