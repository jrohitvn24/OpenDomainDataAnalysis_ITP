		<content> A part of Birchwood (square 9369) is  
 an RAF estate. 98% of the houses are  
{privately rented.}Many of the houses  
 are semi-detached or in small         
 terraces with 2 or 3 bedrooms and     
 garages in separate blocks.By contrast
{private estates}lay on the fringes of 
 Birchwood;these range from mid-priced 
 bungalows and houses to very expensive
 luxury houses with prices up to       
 Â£70,000. The houses have 3 to 5       
 bedrooms with large living space.     
 Houses on Birchwood are still being   
 built and the{site could extend}to    
 include 20,000 people. Skellingthorpe 
 is a{growing village}in which there is
 a community centre near a closed      
 railway station. Many new houses have 
 been built including several bungalows
 and have generally 2 to 3 bedrooms.The
 area is quiet with pleasant,tidy      
 gardens.{Many commuters live here.    </content>
