 Every year there is a Whit Sing on the
 village green.Loxley Silver Band play 
 and people from the churches gather   
 round to sing hymns.The band and the  
 church people walk to the green along 
 the road from Wisewood. People come to
 listen and join in. Someone talks to  
 the people and says a prayer.         
{Loxley Methodist Silver Band}         
 The Band was started nearly  100 years
 ago with people from the church. It is
 still called Loxley Methodist Silver  
 Band but although it practises at the 
 church no one from the church is      
 actually  a member of the band now.   
 The band plays on special village     
 occasions such as the Whit Sing and   
 also in local parks and at other local
 church events. At Christmas time it   
 specialises in playing the local      
 carols in the local public houses.    </content>
