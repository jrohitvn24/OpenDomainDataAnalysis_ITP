		<title>13SOCIAL EVENTS FOR CLUNTON</title>
		<content> As well as the clubs there are regular
 social events in the immediate and    
 surroundings areas. Discos, Barn      
 Dances and Dinners are advertised     
 regularly in Clunton Notice Board and 
 on prominent trees around the Parish. 
    Coffee mornings are popular places 
 for a get together and a number are   
 held throughout the year in aid of    
 charitable causes.                    
    Regular events include Clunton     
 Bazaar, Purslow Show and a coffee     
 morning in the Crown Inn in aid of the
 church.                               
    The Crown Inn is an important      
 meeting place, particularly for the   
 men. It also lays on suppers after the
 Harvest Festival and the Carol        
 Service. It is a good place to be on  
 New Year's Eve when fancy dress is the
 order of the day.
