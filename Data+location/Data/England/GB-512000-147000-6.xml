 mainly sand and clay.  Crops are{     
{wheat, barley, oats, beans, rape, hay,
{kale}and{grass.} Sheep and beef cattle
 are kept.  Some of the crops are used 
 for{fodder.} Crops are rotated because
 some crops take out more than they put
 in to the soil. Some farms have       
{battery hens.                         
      Most farms use a lot of machinery
