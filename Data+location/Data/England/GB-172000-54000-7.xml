 John Opie was born in 1761 at Harmony 
 Cott near Mithian.John's ambition was 
 to be an artist but his father thought
 there was no money in painting so he  
 taught John carpentry.When he was 15  
 years old his talent as an artist was 
 recognised by Dr John Wolcot, a rich  
 doctor and Opie went to live with him 
 in Truro.Dr Wolcot was his tutor and  
 he paid for Opie to have lessons.His  
 first painting was of a local         
 farmhouse which he sold for 5         
 shillings.When he was 18 he went to   
 Exeter and displayed his work at the  
 Society of Artists.Then he went to    
 London and painted portraits of rich  
 people.Soon fame came.
