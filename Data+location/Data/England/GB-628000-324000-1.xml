		<content> The villages of Worstead and Sloley   
 lie in middle of a fertile farming aea
 (arable and dairy) with populations of
 600 and 200 respectively. Worstead,   
 the ancient home of weavers and worstd
 cloth 8with 17 century wevers cottage 
 still visible) is at present better   
 known for the annual 3 day festival   
 raising money for its historic 14th   
 century church of St Marys and other  
 village amenities including new       
 village hall opened by Queen          
 Elizabeth, the Queen Mother in August 
 1985. Sloley parish church, St        
 Bartholomews is even older dated from 
 13c. Worstead still has a railway     
 station on Norwich Cromer line whose  
 future despite many branch line       
 closures in Norfolk seem reasonably   
 secure at present. The largest        
 employer of labour in re is Ross Foots
