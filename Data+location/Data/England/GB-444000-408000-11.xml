		<title>11Frickley Pit</title>
		<content>  The pit is situated at the end of    
 Westfield Lane and was opened in      
 1905.It has the{York/Sheffield railway
 running alongside it with a branch    
 line coming from the pit to the main  
 line.This is to carry coal to the     
 power stations.None of the coal from  
 Frickley is for domestic use.         
  At this particular time the shaft at 
 Frickley is approximately{696 yards   
 deep.The time for winding men down the
 shaft is 1\ mins.The winding engine is
 now electric.At the moment Frickley   
 are working four seams,the shallowest 
 being the{Shafton/Cudworth,}working   
 down through{Melton Field and Dunsil  
 to the deepest{Top Haigh Moor.}There  
 are approximately 1370 men working    
 these four seams,but about 400 may be 
 made redundant in the near future.
