		<title>06HARDWICK VILLAGE SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The building which housed the{village 
{school}is now a private house. It is  
 situated next tp the church and is    
 quite near the Manor Farm. The windows
 of the building are similar to those  
 found in the church. From the window  
 on the east side of the building can  
 be seen a view of the churchyard.     
 Above this window, on the gable, is   
 the bell which was used for calling   
 the children of the village to the    
 school.                               
 The old school building looks like the
 church because it was a church school.
 It was built in 1870 for a roll of 50 
 children, but the average attendance  
 fell over the years. In 1870 it was   
 22, in 1874 20 and between 1898 and   
 1903 it fell to 18. In 1905 the school
 was closed so the children went to    
 school in the village of Little       
 Harrowden, a few miles away.          </content>
