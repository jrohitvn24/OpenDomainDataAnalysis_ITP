		<title>13Local News, Our Exhibition</title>
		<content> On Friday 14th July 1985 Curry Rivel  
 VC Primary School put on an           
 exhibition. It was an Environmental   
 Studies Exhibition. The topics on     
 display were; Peoples Jobs, Birds, Our
 Homes, Old Curry Rivel, Buildings in  
 Curry Rivel, Plants, and my class did 
 a display about a camp in the Quantock
 Hills called Greatwood. We are going  
 to Greatwood at the end of this term  
 for 4 days. Our display also included 
 some work about plants, trees, flowers
 and birds around the school playground
 and field to prepare us for our nature
 studies at Greatwood.I drew and wrote 
 about the Daisy, Buttercup, Nettle,   
 Creeping Speedwell, Venus Looking     
 Glass and the Cypress. Also on display
 were the old school registers and log 
 books and people could walk in and    
 find their names or their relatives'  
 names. Our exhibition was a success.  </content>
