		<title>18THE OLD RAILWAY</title>
		<content> The railway was closed in 1970 by     
 Dr.Beeching and is now overgrown and  
 makes a lovely nature reserve.It was  
 the main East coast line to London and
 was closed from Spalding to           
 Grimsby.There are plans to build a    
 road along it to relieve the A16.Here 
 is a list to show the plants and      
 flowers found along the line from     
 Algarkirk to the old station where an 
 Agricultural firm now does its        
 business.{
