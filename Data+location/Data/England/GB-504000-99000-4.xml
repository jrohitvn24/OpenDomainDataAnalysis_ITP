		<content>    The grey and brown pebbles slope   
 gently to the sea, which at low tide  
 leaves a wide expanse of sand.  The   
 strandline on the beach includes      
 litter from the sea like seaweed,     
 cuttlefish bones, egg cases of the    
 common whelk and plastic bottles,     
 paper and empty cans.                 
    Amongst the pebbles you can find   
 empty slipper limpets, whelk, dog     
 whelk and periwinkle shells           
 discarded by their animal occupants.  
    Due to wave action the larger      
 pebbles are deposited near the top    
 of the groyne section, these having   
 been placed to avoid excessive beach  
 erosion.                              
    On the exposed sand, lugworm casts.
 Various seaweeds, common squid eggs,  
 sandhoppers and crabs were discovered.
 In summer common squid eggs may be    
 washed ashore.                        </content>
