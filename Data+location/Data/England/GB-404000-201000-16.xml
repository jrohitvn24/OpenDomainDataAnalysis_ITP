		<title>16OUR UNIQUE AMPNEY POUND TREE</title>
		<content>  An elm tree grew in the middle of {  
{Ampney Crucis}called{"the Pound Tree".
 There was a legend that, if the pound 
 tree died, no children would be born  
 in the village. The Pound Tree got    
 Dutch Elm disease and slowly died. It 
 was cut down. For three years no      
 children were born but a tiny sucker  
 grew from the root of the dead elm and
 Mark Hughes, James Hickson and Sophie 
 Bird were born in 1980. The sucker has
 grown into a sturdy little tree.      
  {Squire Blackwell}from Ampney Park   
 went off on his white horse, but the  
 horse returned without its rider who  
 was never found. In the years when the
 Ampney Brook dries up, his ghost is   
 supposed to appear!                   
  {Ghosts}are said to haunt the A 417  
 by the Ivy Church (Ampney St. Mary).
