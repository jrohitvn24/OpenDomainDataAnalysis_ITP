		<content> Calverley Residents Action Group_     
 CRAG_was formed in 1975 as a result of
 the proposal to build a road from     
 Shipley to Leeds.This would have      
 passed through Calverley Woods,to the 
 north of the village,and would then   
 have joined up with the proposed      
 extension of the M1 Motorway at a     
 point about a mile to the east of the 
 village.Money was raised and          
 objections and protests made          
 resulting,eventually,in the withdrawal
 by the Government of the proposed     
 Shipley to Leeds road.                
      Whilst still being alive to the  
 threat of new road proposals CRAG then
 began to try and help the inhabitants 
 of Calverley in other ways.Every year 
 CRAG provides bulbs for the school    
 children to plant around the village.
