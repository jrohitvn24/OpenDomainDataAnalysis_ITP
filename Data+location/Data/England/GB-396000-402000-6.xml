		<title>06QUARRIES</title>
		<content> The quarries served the past and in a 
 different way are serving the present.
 The presence of vast amounts of       
 natural stone made it both easy and   
 obvious to use the {DRY STONE WALL }  
 technique to divide pastures and mark 
 boundaries.Throughout this century the
 skill and the walls have fallen into  
 disrepair and with it the necessity to
 quarry. The quarries lay idle and     
 because of their geography hidden from
 view. Rapid obsolescence of industrial
 machines has vastly increased the     
 waste material that is neither        
 biodegradable nor burnable.The disused
 quarries of this area are serving well
 the needs of the eighties by providing
 ideal locations to dispose of this    
 waste. It is fitting and hopeful for  
 the future that one age can restore   
 and repair the environment changed by 
 the differing needs of the past.      </content>
