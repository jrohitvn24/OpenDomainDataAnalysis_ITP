		<title>17HOW WE SPEND OUR SPARE TIME</title>
		<content>      Martin tells us how he spends his
 free time. "I go to Marshalls Cross   
 football club every week.  We         
 sometimes have a match against other  
 teams.  There are seventeen boys in   
 the club.  I play 'midfield' position.
 The club is on a Saturday morning from
 a quarter past ten to twelve o'clock. 
 I like going because I enjoy playing  
 football and I also make new friends. 
 When we have finished playing football
 we go into the Sports' Hall and watch 
 some men playing five-a-side football.
     The club is used by many other    
 organisations for keep-fit, aerobics  
 and yoga as well as for badminton,    
 circuit training and all youth clubs  
 use the facilities.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
