		<title>10A RETIRING TEACHER</title>
		<content> I was born in Bournemouth.  My parents
 came from the Midlands.  I lived in   
 Springbourne and went to St Clements' 
 school.  My school uniform included a 
 hat, two pairs of shoes, one for      
 indoor and one for outside.  One pair 
 was left in the cloakroom all day.  I 
 don't think they would be there today 
 when you got back!                    
 I hated sport, I didn't think there   
 was any need to do sports.  Our games 
 skirts had to be exactly two inches   
 from the ground when we nelt down. You
 cannot imagine that today, girls have 
 so many choices.  This is certainly a 
 different age where children join in  
 adults conversations where as in my   
 day we might have to sit still for two
 hours without interrupting.
