		<content>      Broomhead Reservoir              
 Broomhead Reservoir is situated on the
 northern boundary of our area. It is  
 in the Ewden Valley. The Ewden Beck   
 flows into the River Don. It is eight 
 miles from the centre of Sheffield. It
 was built in 1929 and is about 195    
 metres above sea level. The surface   
 area is 123 acres. Its greatest depth 
 is about 30 metres and it can hold    
 1082 million gallons of water.        
 Geological difficulties were          
 encountered during construction       
 requiring the removal of a slipping   
 hillside on the north, the digging of 
 deep trenches and filling underground 
 fissures with cement. The site is kept
 under constant observation by the     
 Water Board. The area surronding the  
 reservoir has been planted with       
 coniferous trees.
