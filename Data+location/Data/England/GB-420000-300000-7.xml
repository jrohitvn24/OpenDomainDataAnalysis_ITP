		<content> This years Trinity Carnival was held  
on Saturday 22nd June at the Ninefoot  
Recreation Ground in Wilnecote. It     
started with a parade around the       
streets. There were many stalls and    
games . Among the attractions were a   
display of WWII events including a     
battle. There was also a Karate display
and performances from local Jazz bands.
Although the Carnival was very popular 
organisers said it could be the last   
beause of a lack of helpers.           
 On the 8th May a march took place at  
Two Gates to commemorate V.E.day. The  
march started at 7:30pm. The Wilnecote 
branch of the Royal British Legion     
were there as well as the Brownies,the 
Red Cross and the Guides.
