		<title>04The Five Bells Inn</title>
		<content> The Five Bells is an inn just out of  
 Wrentham. It was made in 1611 which   
 makes it 389 years old. It has 7      
 rooms, a kitchen, two bars, a         
 storeroom, a cellar and, behind the   
 bar, well, that's not really a room.  
   In the summer it gets good trade. It
 has two stables, one for horses and   
 one for chickens. Around the back     
 there is a caravan park. Nick Tanner  
                                       
 Dad opens at 12 o'clock and he shuts  
 at 3 o'clock. Then he comes and picks 
 Nick (who wrote the first part of this
 page) and me up from school. Then he  
 has a rest. Then at 7 o'clock Dad goes
 down and opens the pub up. Then at 11 
 o'clock at night we close. We have a  
 treat when the clock chimes. The      
 lights light up.      Sarah Tanner
