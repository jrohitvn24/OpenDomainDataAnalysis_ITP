		<title>15Population of Ref.02760084</title>
		<content>   The total population of this area is
 about 130. Of these about 50 live in  
 the hamlet of Doccombe and 80 in      
 scattered farmsteads. Nine of these   
 farmsteads are occupied by working    
 farmers and their families. Most of   
 the others are no longer farms,the    
 land having been sold to the working  
 farmers,and are occupied by the       
 wealthy middle_aged.The people living 
 in Doccombe are mainly retired people 
 of the professional classes.          
   Consequently there are very few     
 children living in the area and a     
 general description of the population 
 would be sparse,wealthy and over      
 sixty.
