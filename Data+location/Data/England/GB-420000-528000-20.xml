		<title>20LEGEND OF BISHOP AUCKLAND-3</title>
		<content> "By St.Cuthbert!", said the Bishop,   
 laughing, "You have outwitted me as   
 you did the boar. If I am to keep my  
 promise I must give you my own castle.
 come!"                                
 The Bishop took Pollard outside to a  
 small hill and showed him the land    
 surrounding it. He then said,"I will  
 give you all this land in exchange for
 my castle. Will you take it?"         
 Pollard said he would and the Bishop  
 gave it to him and his family for     
 ever.                                 
 Since that day, the land on which     
 Bishop Auckland is built has been     
 known as Pollard's Lands, and there is
 in Etherley Lane, near to St.Anne's   
 School, a public House named "The     
 Pollard".
