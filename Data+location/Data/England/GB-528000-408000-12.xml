		<title>12CLEETHORPES TRAFFIC SURVEY</title>
		<content>  Recently we carried out a traffic    
 survey. We covered all the streets off
 St. Peter's Avenue except De Lacy Lane
 and Bowling Lane. We split up into    
 groups,one for every street. We had   
 half an hour to record the numbers of 
 vehicles  passing. Isaac's Hill was   
 the busiest with{1510}vehicles per    
 hour passing and Elm Road was the     
 least busy with{ 52}vehicles passing. 
 These are the totals in numerical     
 order for the other streets:          
 St.Peter's Avenue 564,St. Peter's Ave.
 (St.Andrew's Methodist Church) 546,   
 Short Street 372,Cambridge Street 340,
 Mill Road 234, Bentley Street 210,and 
 Albert Road 136. We included all kinds
 of transport from bicycles to buses.  
 We thought that most of the traffic on
 Isaac's Hill would be coming from{Clee
{Road}and{Grimsby Road.
