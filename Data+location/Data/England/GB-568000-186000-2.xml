		<content> Nearly all the houses in Basildon were
 built by the Development Corporation, 
 and were rented by the occupiers.     
 About five years ago, these rented    
 houses were offered for sale to the   
 tenants, and about a third of the     
 tenants opted to buy their house. So  
 today, it is a mixture or tenant and  
 owner occupier. The more recent       
 development has all been for owner    
 occupier,and whereas the original     
 houses were terraced and small, the   
 houses being built around the edges of
 the town are now detatched and much   
 larger. Some are selling for Â£100,000.
                                       
 Within our 3x4 kilometres square,     
 nearly alll the housing is in the     
 west-most half. The other half is open
 countryside.
