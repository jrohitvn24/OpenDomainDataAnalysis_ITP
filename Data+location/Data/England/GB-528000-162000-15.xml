		<title>15Wallington Fire Station</title>
		<content>The Wallington Fire Station was built  
in the year 1938. The station has 2    
fire engines and 13 men. There are 4   
people in each fire engine. The fire   
engine must have certain equipment     
like a 1000 foot hose, 300 gallons of  
water and 10 gallons of foam. 300      
gallons of water can hold a fire for   
8 minutes. It is guaranteed that if you
call a fire station and ask for help, a
fire-engine  will be there in 3 minutes
the next in 5 minutes and the third in 
8 minutes. In the whole of London there
are 7000 firemen. Each year they       
recieve 1700 false alarms;the fire     
engines still attend and will ask      
British Telecom who telephoned. How-   
ever each year there are 50,000 fires. 
In Wallington 435 people were injured  
and 125 people died during emergencies 
in 1984.
