		<title>12Traffic Danger</title>
		<content>  There is only one {SOCIAL CONCERN }  
 that we could find from the people of 
 the area and that was in the village  
 of Eaton Constantine. Here people are 
 very worried about the traffic that   
 goes through the village. The main    
 road through the village is an easy   
 route for people travelling from      
 Cressage to Telford. This road is not 
 busy by town standards but is used    
 regularly by people travelling to and 
 from work in the morning and evening. 
 The road is narrow and has no         
 footpath. There is no speed limit and 
 the local people have told the Parish 
 Council and the County Council that   
 they think the situation is dangerous.
  There are no other concerns that     
 people we talked to could think of.   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
