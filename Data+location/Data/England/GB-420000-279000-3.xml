		<title>03Hampton Manor and Grounds</title>
		<content>   When approaching{Hampton}from the   
 West along Solihull Road or Bickenhill
 Lane the densely wooded grounds of    
{Hampton Manor}perhaps give a reminder 
 of the original{Forest of Arden.}These
 trees provide a backdrop to the       
 village. Many of the trees were       
 planted when the grounds were created 
 and include many large specimens of   
 native and introduced trees, including
 an Hungarian Oak and several species  
 of Cedar.                             
   The Manor was built in 1855 to the  
 design of W.E.Nesfield for{Sir}       
{Frederick Peel.}It was built in Tudor 
 Gothic style with battlements. In 1872
 a clock tower attached to the house by
 a covered passage was added.          
   Today the Manor is used by{Hampton} 
{Manor Homes}for mentally handicapped  
 girls.
