		<title>08THE FLYOVER</title>
		<content> Much of Greenford is becoming a       
 concrete jungle and in an effort to   
 take the vast amount of traffic from  
 London to Oxford away from our local  
 army of traffic a flyover was built.  
 In the process four subways were      
 constructed to allow people who are   
 pedestrians to cross from one side of 
 Greenford to the other like a small   
 rickety bridge across a river, so     
 allowing communication between tribes 
 of people on either side of the A40.  
 The GLC have tried to spice up the    
 subways by incorporating tile mosaics 
 made by local schools.  Much graffiti 
 has spread over the walls.  However   
 some of it is good like FRESH and     
 MERLIN. People are intimidated by the 
 sight of the massive structure which  
 in the night is supposed to be a haven
 for vandals, thieves and vagabonds. It
 is however here to stay.              </content>
