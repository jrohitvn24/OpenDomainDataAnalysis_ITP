		<title>13The Y.M.C.A. by Adrian Dee</title>
		<content> On Monday night I go to the{Y.M.C.A.}I
 walk to the Y.M. about 6 o'clock. When
 I get in, I go and hang my coat up.   
 They have{Space Invaders, pinball,    
{football and pool.}They all cost ten  
 pence.We play on the games from half  
 six to seven.Then we have a meeting to
 tell us what we going to do.First of  
 all they tell us about the{fun        
{raising activities,}then we play.We   
 sometimes have a{roller disco.}Then we
 have a tuck shop, where we sell sweets
 and pop.After that we normally go and 
 play in the{pool handicap.}They start 
 off with eight people, when the last  
 game is played, the winner gets a     
 trophy. After that we play{football   
 for half an hour. When the football   
 finishes, we have a disco. At nine    
 o'clock we go home.
