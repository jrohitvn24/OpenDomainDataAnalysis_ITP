		<content> Several small businesses exist locally
 employing a few workers, agriculture  
 being the most important of these.    
 Others include engineering, a petrol  
 station, public house, wrought iron   
 foundry, builders, and local shops.   
                                       
 Most of the working population travel 
 to King's Lynn, where they are        
 employed in a large range of jobs     
 mostly in factories. Others work in   
 banks, offices and shops. The local   
 R.A.F. station at Marham employs some 
 villagers on a civilian basis whilst  
 some R.A.F. personnel live locally.   
                                       
 Others are self-employed in many      
 capacities e.g: Caterers, Newsagents, 
 Horse breeders, Funeral Directors,    
 Market traders and Insurance brokers. 
 A few professional people include a   
 Doctor and a Solicitor.               </content>
