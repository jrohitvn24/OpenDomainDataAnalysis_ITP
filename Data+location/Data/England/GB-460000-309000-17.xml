		<title>17One girl's week day.</title>
		<content>    In the morning I do my teeth. Then 
 I have a cup of tea and get ready for 
 school. My dad wakes up and does the  
 same. Then he drops me off at school. 
    We work until 10.30, then we have  
 break. I buy crisps from the tuckshop.
 After break we have have more tasks to
 be finished by 12.00. If we don't     
 finish we have to do them in the after
 noon. I have school dinner and then a 
 long play. Some afternoons we have    
 games or art or stories. Then it is   
 3.30, home time.                      
    At home I have my tea. When my mum 
 comes home from work I help her. I do 
 the washing up. Then I help my younger
 sister to read or do some work. She   
 copies me and I do some sums for her. 
 We have dinner after that and then I  
 sit with my mum. I do some homework.  
 Then it is time for bed.
