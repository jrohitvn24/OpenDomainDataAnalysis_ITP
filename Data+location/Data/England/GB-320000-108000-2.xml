		<content>   We came to Upottery parish in Aug.  
 1984,when the valley was monopolised  
 by the herds of black and white       
 Frisians that were shepherded by car  
 and dog twice daily through the lanes 
 to the farm milking parlours.There    
 were a few sheep in some of the fields
 and an occasional pig or two.Haymaking
 was over and second silage being      
 cut,and on our walks we would come    
 across great stacks of round          
 bales,wrapped in black polythene in   
 the corners of fields.                
   As autumn advanced,the flocks of    
 sheep grew bigger and by November most
 of the cattle were in sheds round the 
 farms. Just a few were left out in    
 sheltered spots,but,indoors  or       
 out,they were now being fed on silage 
 and bought concentrates.
