 One explaination for the unusual shape
of the well is that a horse drawing a  
trap shied and tossed the driver head  
first into the well. The roundhouse was
built to stop anything like that       
happening again.                       
 Another story is that the building was
done after the well water had been     
contaminated and caused an epidemic in 
the area.                              
 The final cost of the well's          
reconstruction was over one thousand   
eight hundred pounds, but estimates    
ranged from eight hundred and seventy  
five pounds to over two thousand       
pounds."
