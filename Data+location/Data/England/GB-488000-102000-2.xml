		<content> The soil is mainly brickearth: about  
 half being Deep Hook Series and one   
 third Shallow Park Gate Series.   Both
 are classed as Grade 1 or 2 for       
 agricultural purposes.   The rest is  
 Riverine Alluvium over flinty gravel, 
 it is ill-drained and often marshy.   
 In the NW corner are lakes, the legacy
 of the sand/gravel extracting         
 industry.   Although gravel is no     
 longer extracted one pit still serves 
 as a storage and distribution point   
 for sand brought in by train from the 
 Lavant area.   The water-table is high
 and small streams flow from the marshy
 areas.   The water in the streams is  
 clear and supports abundant life.     
 The stream flowing down Brookside in  
 Runcton is a home for brown trout and 
 frogs - indicating unpolluted water.
