		<title>17MANAGER, BARCLAYS BANK</title>
		<content>    He has held his present post for   
 just over 2 years. He is manager of 2 
 branches: Edgware and Burnt Oak. They 
 have a management team of 4 people,   
 who supervise 66 other staff. They    
 alternate jobs between branches.      
    Edgware Branch was built in 1984   
 but Burnt Oak Branch was opened in    
 1890. Opening hours are 0930-1530.    
 Because of competition they also open 
 on Saturday mornings to bring in more 
 custom.                               
    Both branches are busiest on Monday
 mornings because shopkeepers bring in 
 the weekend's takings then. Also, the 
 beginnings and endings of the month   
 are busy times.                       
    The Manager regards his job as     
 demanding but very interesting. He    
 sees it, essentially, as helping      
 others to solve their problems.
