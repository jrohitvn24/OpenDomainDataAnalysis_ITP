		<content> Of the six parishes in this block,    
 five are in Herefordshire, and Suckley
 is in Worcestershire. Acton Beauchamo 
 was in Worcestershire until the end of
 last century when county councils     
 were set up and boundaries were       
 rationalised. The two counties have   
 been combined since l974 but local    
 inhabitants still feel loyalty to     
 their former county. Stanford Bishop  
 probably had a Roman settlement and a 
 mediaeval village existed between the 
 church and court. There was also a    
 mediaeval settlement near Acton       
 Beauchamp church. The turnpike road to
 Malvern from Bromyard bisects the two 
 parishes, houses and cottages were    
 built along the roads and no nucleated
 settlement survived or developed. In  
 the east of Stanford Bishop lay       
 Wofferwood common which was not       
 enclosed until l862.                  </content>
