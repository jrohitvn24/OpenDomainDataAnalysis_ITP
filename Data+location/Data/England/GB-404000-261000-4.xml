		<title>04MAIN FEATURES,ASTWOOD BANK</title>
		<content>  Astwood Bank has two schools in it.  
 Most children attend them.It also has 
 three churches.Another main feature is
  the Saltway.You can't see it because 
 the village is built on top of it.An  
 important feature which everyone can  
 see is the war memorial.It is placed  
 outside the post office in Evesham    
 Road.The war memorial is in           
 rememberence of all the people who    
 lived,or were known,in Astwood Bank   
 and were killed or injured in the     
 World Wars.There are 5 public houses  
 situated in various parts of Astwood  
 Bank,but none of them are placed near 
 one another.Most of the public houses 
 are visited by regular customers,and  
 the churches are attended on Sundays. 
 They also provide activities for the  
 children.
