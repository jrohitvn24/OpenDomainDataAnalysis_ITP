		<content>         High Street is a delightful   
 reminder of the past with many fine   
 Georgian and Victorian buildings.At   
 the bottom of the street is the Red   
 Lion an old coaching inn.This opens   
 into West Street which is very wide   
 and now a pedestrian prescinct.In the 
 last century it was the market place  
 with a mixture of animals and stalls  
 of all kinds.                         
         The shopping prescinct is now 
 on one side of the street and a large 
 department store is due to replace the
 old buildings on the other side of the
 street.                               
         Further developments are due  
 very shortly and one listed building  
 which will remain is Westbury         
 Manor.This was used as council offices
 until two years ago,and is            
 provisionally earmarked as the museum 
 for the town.                         </content>
