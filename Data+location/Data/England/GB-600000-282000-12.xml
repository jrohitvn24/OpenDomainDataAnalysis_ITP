		<content>      Mr. and Mrs. Pond own the Post   
 Office in North Lopham.  It is very   
 convenient for the local people,      
 because it means they can post their  
 letters without going to the nearest  
 town.  They also sell butter, soap,   
 flower seeds, cereals, pet foods,     
 sweets, vegetables, tinned food, etc. 
      Mr. and Mrs. Pond have lived in  
 North Lopham for 13 years.  When they 
 first came here they didn't have many 
 customers, but now they have a lot    
 more.  Their busiest day in the week  
 is pension day, which is Thursday.    
 They get about the same amount of     
 custom from the Post Office as the    
 Village Shop. They think there will be
 a future for small village shops, in  
 spite of competition from larger town 
 shops.  They have never been burgled, 
 though someone tried when they first  
 moved in.                             </content>
