		<title>02Description of Manningtree</title>
		<content> Manningtree is a small town on the    
 borders of Essex and Suffolk,         
 surrounded by villages; Lawford,      
 Bradfield, Ardleigh, Mistley and Great
 Bromley. Manningtree is smaller than  
 the other villages and is a maze of   
 small roads and houses. It has been on
 the map for hundreds of years, being  
 mentioned in Shakespeare as being     
 famous for its feasts. There are two  
 Primary Schools in Lawford, Lawford   
 and Highfields while the secondary    
 school, situated in Lawford is called 
 Manningtree School. Down by the river 
 there are boats moored and several    
 warehouses with a workshop and large  
 storage area owned by Jewson. The     
 Stour Estuary is peaceful and swans   
 congregate near the Maltings at       
 Mistley, the river itself is alive    
 with small boats.
