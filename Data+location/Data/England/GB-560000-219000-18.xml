		<title>18Dunmow's  Society of Friends</title>
		<content>   The Society of Friends have their   
 meeting house in New Street, Dunmow.  
 They meet there on Sundays at eleven  
 o'clock.  Another name for the Friends
 is Quakers.                           
   The service has no set pattern to   
 it.  The Friends all sit around in a  
 circle.  Sometimes nothing is said at 
 all because they are concentrating    
 their minds on God.  If somebody wants
 to speak then he or she will stand up 
 and tell a story or say what happened 
 to them during the week or say a      
 prayer.                               
   They have no ceremonies, statues or 
 prayerbooks like other Christian      
 churches and believe that there is a  
 bit of God in everyone - even bad     
 people.                               
   Every fifth Sunday the Quakers join 
 with other Christian churches in      
 Dunmow to have a service together.    </content>
