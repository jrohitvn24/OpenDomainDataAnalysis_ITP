		<content> This section was prepared by the      
 children of {OXSPRING J&amp;I SCHOOL,}from
 class J1/J2 taught by Mrs.H           
 Charlesworth, and the J3/J4 class     
 taught by Mr.W Robinson.              
 We would like to thank everyone who   
 helped us on our travels. The Parents 
 who came along, the Farmers who gave  
 up their time and answered our        
 questions, British Steel and Conoco   
 for allowing us to visit parts of     
 their holdings in the area but mostly,
 the children who worked hard to       
 produce this record. Especially;-     
 Tom payne, David Jones, Andrew Brown, 
 Duncan Austin, Helen Thorp, Daniel    
 Wlison, John Pennington, Garry Wilson,
 Robert Hinchcliffe, Jonathan Sudworth,
 who gave up playtimes etc. to finish  
 the project off, also thanks to anyone
 we've missed off.
