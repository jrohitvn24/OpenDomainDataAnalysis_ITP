		<title>06CHRISTCHURCH CASTLE II</title>
		<content> If any castles were built in those    
 days they would have been built out of
 stone. At the beginning of the Civil  
 War the castle was held by the        
 Royalists. In April 1644{General      
{Waller's Parliamentarian}troops       
 captured a hundred horses and four    
 hundred infantry. Later the same year 
 a{Royalist}general{Lord Goring        
 attacked Christchurch but was beaten  
 off. A few months later he attacked   
 again and drove the Parliamentarian   
 garrison into the church and castle,  
 but he was forced out of the town.    
 Then thirty tons of oak were sent to  
 Christchurch for its defences but     
 after the execution of{Charles 1}the  
 Parliamentarian government feared that
 the castle might be used on behalf of 
 his son,so they knocked most of it    
 down.                                 
                                       </content>
