		<title>12Importance of television</title>
		<content>The television plays an increasingly   
important part in our lives both as a  
means of entertainment and as an       
information service.                   
We did a survey of 60 pupils to find   
how important the television actually  
was.                                   
Both parents and children watched an   
average between 20 &amp; 50 hours a week,  
although parents tended to watch less  
than their children.                   
Television was seen as an important    
means of entertainment with "soap      
operas" such as "Dallas" &amp; "Coronation 
Street";,comedies and light drama      
series are also very popular.          
Television was also seen as an         
important information service with 98% 
of the survey population keeping in    
touch with the worldwide news through  
television rather than through radio   
and newspapers.                        </content>
