		<title>05A HAMLET NEAR SUTTON VENY</title>
		<content>   I live in Tytherington,it is a ham- 
 let with a church and three farms.My  
 Dad works on the farm which has about 
 600 acres.It has six tractors and one 
 combine.  The biggest building is the 
 kennels where the dogs were kept for  
 hunting.                              
                                       
   Our house is 400 years old.We have  
 not got a shop, a post office or a    
 garage.  There is a large green with  
 two big old trees in the middle.  We  
 hold barbeques and dances here.       
 The church was built in the 11th      
 century, it has no lighting or heating
 and is only used once a month.  Each  
 year we have a fund raising for the   
 church in which everyone takes part.  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
