		<title>10DEEPING ST.JAMES VIDEOS</title>
		<content>   We interviewed a sample of one hund-
 red and thirty four people.Most had a 
 VHS.Sixty four owned their own        
 machine. The rest hire theirs.        
   Most of those in our survey used    
 their video to record programmes      
 on the television.                    
   You can buy video tapes with films  
 already recorded on them. They are    
 quite expensive.On average they cost  
 Â£15.00.But we think it is a waste of  
 time buying these,for after you have  
 watched them a few times you get bored
 with them.Because of this people hire 
 tapes.In this locality there are four 
 outlets where you can choose films.Two
 of these only deal in video tapes.They
 have hundreds of different titles. One
 of the other outlets is a garage and  
 the other is an off-licence.
