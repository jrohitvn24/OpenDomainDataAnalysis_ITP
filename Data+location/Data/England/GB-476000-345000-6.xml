		<title>06Growing potatoes</title>
		<content> Phorate granules is a chemical mixed  
 with seed potatoes before being       
 planted.It kills of grubs and insects.
 The seed potatoes are put in soil with
 the potato planter.This digs a hole,  
 drops the seed in and covers          
 it over.The plants are fed with a     
 fertilizer containing 12 units of     
 nitrogen, 8 of phosphates,and 18 of   
 potash. These are chemicals that all  
 plants need for healthy growth.It     
 comes in a bag that disolves in       
 water.A tractor sprays the crop while 
 it is young .When it is older they    
 will need a helicopter to spray       
 them.The harvester digs up the        
 potatoes.Then the potatoes are put    
 onto a long conveyor belt.They then go
 through a grader, into a washer and   
 then a drier.The potatoes can not be  
 packed when they are wet or they will 
 rot.Then a machine weighs them.       </content>
