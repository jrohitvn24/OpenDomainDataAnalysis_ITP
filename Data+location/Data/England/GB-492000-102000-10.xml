		<content>   Most houses in Barnham have been    
 built in the last ten years and a few 
 shops have been built too.The older   
 houses stand along the main road      
 through Barnham.These were built about
 50 to 80 years ago.All the houses     
 around the area are built with bricks 
 and tiles.                            
   The older houses are larger with 4  
 or 5 bedrooms and have had to build   
 garages.The modern houses are much    
 smaller and have 3 to 4 bedrooms with 
 garages.They are not spaced out so    
 much and have smaller gardens.The area
 around is very scenic and is a nice   
 place to live.Most families like their
 homes and could not think of a better 
 place to live.Others would like their 
 homes to be bigger and better,but like
 the environment around them.
