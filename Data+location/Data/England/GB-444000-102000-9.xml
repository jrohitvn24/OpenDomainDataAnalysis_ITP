		<content>{An interview with our school caretaker
    In 1926 when Mr.Peat was 5 years   
 old he started at Fawley school.When  
 Fawley school first opened only 37    
 children went there.He left school    
 when he was 14 but before he left he  
 did work on the fields harvesting the 
 crops.All the children in the area    
 went to Fawley school.                
    When Mr.Peat was 9 he got up at    
 6.30 in the morning and did a milk    
 round before school which started at  
 9.00.After school at about 3.30 he    
 would do another milk round,then he   
 would work in somebodies garden.      
    In those days they didn't have taps
 in their house.Mr.Peat had to pump    
 water out of a well.If he had the time
 he would pump out the people's        
 cesspit.For doing all this work he    
 would get 5 shillings a week which in 
 our money would be 25p.               </content>
