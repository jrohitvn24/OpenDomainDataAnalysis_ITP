		<title>09CONSTABLE BURTON HALL(ctd.)</title>
		<content>   The house contains many beautiful   
 objects,but as it is a family home it 
 is not open to the public.During World
 War One,however,the house was used as 
 a hospital for injured soldiers.      
                                       
   The grounds are open to the public  
 and are renowned for the display of   
 daffodils in the Spring.There is also 
 an avenue of limes which is very      
 beautiful.                            
                                       
   The old driveway,with its imposing  
 entrance gates and balustraded bridge 
 over the beck,can still be seen.A     
 large pond is now used for ducks.A    
 walled garden provides the house with 
 fresh vegetables.                     
                                       
   Within the grounds of the Hall there
 is now a caravan park,popular with the
 many tourists that visit this area.   </content>
