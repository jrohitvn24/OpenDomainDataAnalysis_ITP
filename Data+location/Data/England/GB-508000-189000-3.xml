		<title>03HAYDON SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Haydon is a mixed comprehensive school
 situated on Haste Hill.It used to be  
 two grammar schools,but times and     
 school life changed and the two       
 schools merged into one.They are      
 joined by "the Link"_a long corridor  
 which has the staff block in the      
 middle.The rest of the school consists
 of two 3_storey buildings.68 teachers 
 teach 1080 pupils from 1st to 6th year
 and there are 8 periods in a day so   
 each day lasts about 7 hours including
 breaks.There are 6 classes in a year  
 group,each with 30 pupils of mixed    
 ability or in some cases,all of the   
 same ability.We also have 6 tennis    
 courts and a large field.
