		<title>11Our VIsit to Rock Farm</title>
		<content> We visited{Rock Farm}because the      
 people who own it follow the{Rudolf   
{Steiner}educational principles and    
 have opened their home to provide a   
 settled environment and training      
 centre for mentally handicapped       
 teenagers. The house is over 250 years
 old,some ceiling beams came from      
 fighting ships. The farm has only 8   
 acres of land now but the young people
 care for the land and animals as part 
 of their therapy. They grow vegetables
 and keep hens and cows. One girl was  
 making wholemeal bread, one was making
 butter. They study various crafts and 
 have helpers who stay for up to a year
 before beginning their training. The  
 owners hope the young people will     
 learn enough social skills to be able 
 to live in a sheltered home with other
 mentally handicapped adults.
