		<title>01Bottisham Fen general review</title>
		<content> Bottisham Fen area lies just to the   
 south of the river Cam, and includes  
 part of Swaffham Prior Fen. It is     
 bisected by Swaffham Lode which runs  
 from SE to NW to join the Cam at      
 Swaffham Lock. A second lode, the     
 Bottisham Lode, crosses the SW corner 
 in parallel with the former. The NE   
 corner stops a few metres short of the
 Reach Lode. All three are ancient     
 navigation and drainage channels,     
 carrying water across the low fenlands
 from the chalk hills to the south. The
 land is mainly arable, bounded by     
 drainage ditches, minor roads and     
 grass droveways (farm tracks). The    
 soil is fertile and peaty in places,  
 having been reclaimed from fen within 
 the last hundred years or so. It is   
 now very well drained and does not    
 flood. Population is sparse.
