		<title>09Blue Bell Garage</title>
		<content> The Blue Bell Garage was built twenty 
 six years ago and has since been      
 changed to a large covered area with  
 better designed pumps which serve     
 the{petrol}in litres and give the     
 total cost to the motorist. Most      
 people use four star petrol which is  
 the most expensive at Â£1.94 per       
 gallon.                               
 The garage takes great care with      
 safety precautions and as yet there   
 have not been any accidents with the  
 petrol. Apart from serving petrol they
 service cars, provide a hire car      
 service, sell old and new vehicles and
 have a{car wash}which costs Â£1 per    
 car. As for car sales, the best       
 selling cars are{Vauxhalls}for which  
 the garage has a franchise. They sell 
 mainly medium priced family cars      
 costing between Â£5000 and Â£6000.
