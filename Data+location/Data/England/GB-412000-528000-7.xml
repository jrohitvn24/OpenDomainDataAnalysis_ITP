		<content> bale grab, silage fork, a grass       
 cutter, a fertilizer spreader and an  
 assortment of trailers.               
      The main purpose of the farm is  
 the production of cattle and sheep for
 sale at the local market, to which    
 they go regularly in the late summer  
 and early autumn.                     
      The weather in the summer of     
 1985 has caused severe problems on the
 farm. Rain and high winds from a      
 constant flow of low pressure areas   
 from the Atlantic Ocean has severely  
 hampered the collection of the hay    
 crop. As a result the majority of the 
 grass crop has been collected as      
 silage.                               
       On a brighter note Saturday     
 September 14th. saw the marriage of   
 the elder son Graeme who will now live
 and work on the farm.
