		<content>    Eastham is well served by its road 
 system.The{A41}is the main road       
 linking Liverpool and Chester;and the 
 M.53,which starts at Wallasey and     
 finishes at Chester,links with the A41
 at junction 5.This motorway has three 
 lanes and a hard shoulder.Private     
 cars,buses and lorries travel along i 
    The{M.53}joins onto the M.56 which 
 goes to Manchester,Warrington and     
 Runcorn. The M.56 then links with the 
{M.62,}which is the trans-Pennine      
 motorway,and the M6 which travels to  
 the North and South of the country.   
    In the 1960's there was much much  
 concern in Eastham at the number of   
 oil tankers passing through the       
 village.As a result a by-pass was     
 built and the tankers now leave the   
 motorway just past junction 5         
 and avoid the village.
