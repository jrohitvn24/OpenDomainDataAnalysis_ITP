		<content>{ST ANDREW'S CHURCH}In the church there
 is a{BAPTISIM FONT}and it has been in 
 the church  since the Normans.{The    
{church was built in the year 1272.}The
 most valuable thing is a silver       
 challis which was given by Thomas Weir
 in the 16th century and it is kept in 
 the bank.{The organ was put there in  
{the year 1929}.We went to the top of  
 the tower and there were 104 steps.   
{There are six bells in the tower.     
   Our overall opinion of the area was 
 that most of the land was for dairy   
 farming with some for crops and for   
 growing feed. There were few houses   
 and those seemed very old and quaint. 
 In the original {DOMESDAY BOOK }when  
 the area was called {HALSBRETONA}there
 were large woods but now it is quite  
 different.Also then animals were a    
 very important product as they are    
 now.                                  </content>
