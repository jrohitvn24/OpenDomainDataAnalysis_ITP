		<content> The steeper sides of the Wolds are    
 liable to slip and this is countered  
 by ploughing &amp; drainage and this was  
 done recently to an area known as The 
 Clumps.                               
 THE CHURCH _ Parish Church of St      
 Thomas is 12thC with 13thC Tower and  
 there is a small Gallery. It is in    
 Walesby Group of 6 Parishes and gets 2
 Services a month with congregation of 
 about 15. This small community has to 
 work hard to maintain the Church. In  
 1985 Manpower Services Commission used
 to rebuild Churchyard wall and earlier
 the inside walls of the tower were re_
 pointed and the interior of the Church
 replastered and redecorated. Until 80 
 years ago was private church of
