		<title>09MY HOBBY</title>
		<content>My hobby is collecting insects.First I 
get the equipment together which is a  
range of different sized boxes,a       
net,pins and{ a large needle which I   
kill the insects with by putting them  
in a jam jar of water.They become      
drousy and then I pierce the body      
between the head and its thorax .      
Afterwards I keep the insects in a     
small box which has been lined with    
paper or  cotton wool.Sometimes I go   
down to the compost heap where there   
are some large wasps.I lay traps which 
are jam jars sunk into the ground.In   
these I only catch things like         
ground beetles but nothing             
spectacular. Any insects which I don't 
want I sell to my brother who puts     
them in resin which is a sort  of      
liquid glass.My best catch was a       
dragon fly which I set in resin and now
keep safely in my bedroom.             </content>
