		<content>{ Sir Alfred Hickman}was one of the    
 chief landowners of Stockingford. He  
 explored for coal and opened{'The Old 
{Pit'}near Stockingford Station. The   
 shaft and winding wheel can still be  
 seen. This gave employment to a great 
 number of men near their own homes.   
 The firm of{Stanley's}also had a pit  
 nearby. Both pits had trouble with    
{flooding}meaning constant use of      
 pumps.One was closed and an automatic 
 pump installed in the other.In 1912   
 another shaft was opened,{Tunnel Pit. 
 These worked until 1967.In 1887,      
{Chapel End Pit}was closed due to      
 flooding.{Ansley Hall Pit}(owned by   
 J. Phillips, grandfather of{Mark      
{Phillips,}until{Nationalisation})     
 closed.                               
  Houses for{Scottish miners}were built
 along Ansley Road, now part of Grove  
 Farm Estate.                          </content>
