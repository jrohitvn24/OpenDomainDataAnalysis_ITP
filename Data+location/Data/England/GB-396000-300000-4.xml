 I wake up at 7.35 a.m.,get dressed and
 go to see my baby brother.I take him  
 downstairs and put him in his         
 baby-walker.I then have my breakfast, 
 prepare my lunch and start out for    
 school at half past eight.Mr Davies   
 blows the whistle at five minutes to  
 nine and I go into school.When the    
 register has been marked we go to the 
 Hall for assembly,which usually takes 
 about twenty minutes.We then have     
 lessons,usually Maths and Language for
 the rest of the morning,except for a  
 fifteen minutes break.Lunch break is  
 from 12.00 to 1.15 then in the        
 afternoon we have Religious Education 
 and Games.School ends at 3.30.I watch 
 television and play with my friend    
 until tea time.After tea I have a     
 shower,watch television or read until 
 9.00 when I go to bed.                </content>
