		<content>{ UPTON}IS A POPULAR PLACE TO LIVE.    
 PEOPLE ARE FRIENDLY AND THERE IS NO   
 RACIAL PREJUDICE.MOST INHABITANTS WORK
 LOCALLY AND UNEMPLOYMENT IS LOW.BUSES 
 ARE FREQUENT BUT EXPENSIVE.BRITISH    
 RAIL HAVE MOVED THE STATION NEARER THE
 CENTRE OF POPULATION. SOME CRITICS SAY
 THERE IS LITTLE SOCIAL LIFE FOR THE   
 YOUNG AND A COMMUNITY CENTRE IS       
 NEEDED.OTHER COMPLAINTS ARE THAT DOGS 
 FOUL THE PAVEMENTS,THE COUNCIL IS SLOW
 TO REPAIR PROPERTY,NOISY YOUTHS ANNOY 
 OLDER CITIZENS AND THE TRAFFIC NOISE, 
 ESPECIALLY FROM THE NEW M53 MOTORWAY  
 IS TOO GREAT. OLDER PEOPLE LOOK       
 FORWARD TO THE OPENING OF THE NEW     
 SAFEWAYS SUPERMARKET IN THE AUTUMN AS 
 IT WILL BE CONVENIENT AND CHEAP FOR   
 THEM.OTHERS COMPLAIN THAT IT IS AN    
 UGLY NEW BUILDING,THAT IT WILL TAKE   
 CUSTOM FROM A ROW OF SMALL SHOPS AND  
 CREATE TRAFFIC CONGESTION.            </content>
