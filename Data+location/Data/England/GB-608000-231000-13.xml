		<title>13Lawford Hall</title>
		<content> Lawford Hall was owned by two         
 families, the D'Arcy and Waldegrave   
 families. Originally King Harold took 
 possession of this area.              
  In 1583 Lawford Hall was rebuilt by a
 man called Edward Waldegrave. It was  
 also refurbished in the 18th century  
 with a brick front added.             
  The hall has an adjacent church,     
 cottages, rectories and an avenue of  
 limes. The house or hall looks        
 Georgian but underneath the front,    
 (built in 1756) it has Elizabethan    
 walls. Also Lawford hall contains     
 gabled wings, Elizabethan chimney     
 stacks and the stairs are turreted.
