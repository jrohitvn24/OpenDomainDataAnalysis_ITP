		<title>14Ravenstock Farm</title>
		<content> Ravenstock farm is an all-arable farm.
 The main crops that are grown there   
 are wheat, barley, and peas. The farm 
 consists of over five hundred acres of
 land, and another three hundred is    
 hired every year.                     
    Ravenstock is on the edge of a busy
 little village called Hadstock. The   
 farm was started by Mr.Barker's       
 grandfather, when he came down from   
 the north of England.                 
    The only animals that are kept are 
 pets such as cats and dogs. The three 
 farmers there are all brothers. They  
 go shopping in Saffron Walden often,  
 because it is the largest town nearby.
 Also they go to get the farm machines 
 mended if any go wrong. They buy all  
 their farm machinery from Saffron     
 Walden. The farmers' families hardly  
 ever get any summer holidays because  
 of harvest-time.                      </content>
