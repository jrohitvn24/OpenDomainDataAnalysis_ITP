		<title>14Social Changes in Cumnor</title>
		<content>      The Cumnor Hill{By-pass,}built in
 1974 at a cost of over Â£4million trig-
 gered changes in the village. A oneway
 traffic  system and a big reduction in
 through traffic have reduced trade for
 the  butcher and caused the closure of
 one  general store.  However, business
 at  Cumnor Hotel  has increased partly
 because  of  the  improved environment
 but  also because of a shortage of Bed
 and  Breakfast  accommodation in rural
 areas  for foreign tourists.  Visitors
 from  Brazil,  Australia, USA, Ireland
 and Britain now use the hotel.        
      The  72  new  Glebelands  houses,
 though  criticised  by  some villagers
 concerned  about  the   character   of
 Cumnor,  will provide homes on land of
 poor  agricultural value for newlyweds
 and elderly folk.The remaining general
 store  may  not  be  able to cope with
 increased demand from newcomers.      </content>
