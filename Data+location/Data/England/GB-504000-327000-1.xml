		<title>01OVERVIEW, KIRKBY UNDERWOOD</title>
		<content> This is a rural area of undulating    
 land. Approximately two-thirds of the 
 area is farmland and a large proport- 
 ion of the remainder woodland.        
 In the S.E.corner of the area lies    
 the village of{KIRKBY UNDERWOOD}with  
 a population of 150 whilst the hamlet{
{of HANTHORPE}in the S.W. has a popul- 
 ation of 20.                          
 There are a handful of outlying farms 
 and houses ,amounting to another 30   
 people.                               
 In the centre of this block lies      
{TEMPLE WOOD,}and its northern boundry 
 is adjacent to an old aerodrome, now  
 used as storage for vintage vehicles. 
 Less than a mile to the E.runs the    
 A15 Sleaford to Peterborough which    
 effectively marks the edge of the     
 Lincolnshire Fens.                    
 Features of the landscape are police  
 and British Telecom radar towers.     </content>
