 When I go to school I get up at 7-30  
 a.m.I have a wash, get dressed and    
 then I have my breakfast of cereal and
 a cup of tea.I go to school at 8-45.  
 At 9 o'clock the teacher takes the    
 register and then we go into assembly.
 Sometimes the headmistress reads a    
 story and we sing hymns or have a     
 prayer.We work until 10-30a.m.when it 
 is breaktime.I have milk and then take
 my crisps outside to eat in the       
 playground.Lunch is at 12-15.I have   
 sandwhiches, but some children have   
 hot lunches. We work or draw or have  
 P.E. in the afternoon and at 3p.m. we 
 go home, and I have my tea.After tea I
 put on my jeans and my coat and play  
 outside until 7-30p.m.then I go inside
 and have a hot drink.Sometimes I watch
 the television or read a book.After a 
 wash I go to bed at 8-30p.m.          </content>
