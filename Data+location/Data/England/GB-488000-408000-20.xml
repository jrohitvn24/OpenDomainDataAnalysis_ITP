		<content>  Children from five Junior schools    
 took part in the project. These       
 schools were{Ashby, Brumby, Grange    
{Lane, Lincoln Gardens}and{Rochdale    
{Road.}The children collected some data
 and wrote almost all the text.        
  Their work was coordinated by        
 students at{John Leggott Sixth Form   
{College,}who opted for this project as
 a Wednesday afternoon{General Studies 
 activity. The John Leggott students   
 collected some data and selected,     
 edited and typed the text.            
  The children of Grange Lane Junior   
 School had particular difficulty      
 because their school was broken into  
 and{vandalised,}much of their work    
 being damaged.
