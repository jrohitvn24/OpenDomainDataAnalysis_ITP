		<title>16Shopping Facilities</title>
		<content> There are no shops within the         
 designated area, following the recent 
 closure of the Farm Shop at Fountain  
 Farm, between the Kilnwick crossroads 
 and Watton. This shop had provided a  
 range of fruit and vegetables and     
 other farm produce, plus a variety of 
 farm-related goods such as woollen    
 jumpers and rugs.                     
 The nearest shop is to be found at    
 Kilnwick, although most people tend to
 use the shops at Hutton Cranswick for 
 immediate requirements and those at   
 Driffield or Beverley for major items 
 or large-scale shopping.              
 Beswick still retains a sub-post      
 office, but this only operates on a   
 part-time basis.                      
 For all other facilities a journey    
 beyond the confines of the designated 
 area is necessary.
