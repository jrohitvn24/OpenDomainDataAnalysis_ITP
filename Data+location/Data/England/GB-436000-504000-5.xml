		<content> occupied,though some are rented.The   
 oldest houses in Appleton are Garth   
 house and Mr. Harris's house opposite.
 Both are on Front St., overlooking the
 village greens,both are about 400years
 old.Some interesting conversions have 
 taken place Holme View in Baker St.   
 was a Methodist Chapel, the house on  
 the corner next to "Briarmead" was    
 originally a Mechanics Institute, at  
 Hornby the old mill is now a house.   
 Most people in private housing have   
 moved into Appleton within the last   
 20years because they wanted to live in
 pleasant countryside within travelling
 distance of industrial and comercial  
 centres.People who come to live in    
 Appleton Wiske like it,and the main   
 reason for moving away is change of   
 job.The 30 or so houses that make up  
 the village of Hornby are mostly      
 grouped around the village green. Nick</content>
