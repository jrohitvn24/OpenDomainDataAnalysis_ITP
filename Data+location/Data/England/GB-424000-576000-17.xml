		<content> Local traditions and customs are now  
 little different to those of any      
 modern town, but one or two odd ones  
 still remain. An interesting one is   
 the making of a{Christening}when a    
 child is baptised. This is a bag      
 containing salt, sugar, cake, silver  
 coins and a toy.It is given to the    
 first child of the opposite sex to the
 baby seen on the way to church. Some  
 older people still make a{Garland}at  
 Christmas. This is made of two hoops  
 joined at right angles, and decorated 
 with ribbons and tinsel. These were   
 common before Christmas trees came    
 into use. At weddings in the town a   
 Hoy-oot can still sometimes happen.   
 When the couple drive away from the   
 church, they throw a handful of small 
 coins from their car for watching     
 children to pick up.Quite dangerous!
