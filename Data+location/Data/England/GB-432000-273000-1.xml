		<content> Area lies to the south of Coventry,   
 comprising undulating land drained by 
 the River Sowe and Finham Brook. It   
 has a long history with evidence of   
 Saxon and Roman occupation. Lunt Fort 
 is a Roman site but the Saxon burial  
 ground is no longer in existence. The 
 farmland was once large estates, but  
 in recent years great pressure has    
 been put on the land and farms have   
 been divided and converted to other   
 uses, such as Coventry Civic airport, 
 sewage works and housing estates.     
 Baginton village an historic          
 settlement is now a dormitory town for
 Coventry. In many ways it is a typical
 rurban area, that is a rural area     
 greatly influenced by the nearness of 
 a large urban area.
