		<title>17SAMPFORDS HAMLETS</title>
		<content> In this area there are two hamlets.   
 The first is the hamlet of Tindon End.
 Here are several examples of large    
 well maintained private houses with   
 a few farm houses as well.  One of    
 these large houses is Tindon End      
 Manor.  Surrounding all the houses is 
 farm land.  Only one road, with two   
 side roads running from it, serves    
 this hamlet.  This road is a          
 cul-de-sac and it is necessary to     
 travel into the village of Gt.        
 Sampford to reach any other town. The 
 second hamlet is at Wimbish Green.    
 The houses here are not as big as     
 those at Tindon End.  They are well   
 maintained.  Some are farm houses.    
 The road which serves this hamlet is  
 also a cul-de-sac.  The residents     
 either have to travel to Radwinter or 
 Wimbish, neighbouring villages to     
 reach other towns.                    </content>
