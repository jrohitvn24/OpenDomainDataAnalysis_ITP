		<content> General Area of Brent Knoll           
 The area is domimated by Brent Knoll  
 Which is about 470ft high. From the   
 top it is possible to for long        
 distances across the Bristle Channel  
 on one side and across Somerset on the
 other.The land is mainly flat.It      
 consists of low-lying grass land,which
 is crissed-crossed by rhynes(A rhyne  
 is a narrow stream which drains into  
 the sea).Approximately 2/3 of the area
 is used for dairy farming.There are   
 two villages,East Brent and Brent     
 Knoll,which was once Known as South   
 Brent.Both villages lie at the foot of
 the Knoll on oppsite sides.Each       
 village appears to have grown from its
 own church,both built on the lower    
 slopes of the Knoll.A few farm houses 
 lie on the outskirts of each village.
