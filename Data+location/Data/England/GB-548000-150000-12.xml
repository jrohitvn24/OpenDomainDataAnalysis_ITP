  Was built in 1476 as a large Wealden 
 Hall house of two bays length(30 feet)
 and two storeys in height, the upper  
 story being jettied. The interior     
 beams are large with a hugh roof-truss
 with an octagonal king-post. A        
 fireplace and chimney were added in   
 Stuart times and in the Georgian      
 period a whole new brick front was    
 added with new windows completely     
 hiding the timber framing. A          
 substantial extension has been added  
 to the rear in recent times so that   
 the Wealden 'core' is now totally     
 encased.
