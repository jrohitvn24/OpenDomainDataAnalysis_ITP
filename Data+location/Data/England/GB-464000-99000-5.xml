		<title>05Continental Ferry Port</title>
		<content>   With Portsmouth's superb situation, 
 having easy sea-ward access to Europe,
 it would appear obvious to have a     
 ferry port. Its potential, however,   
 was not realised until 1976, when,    
 after the completion of the{M275,}a   
 direct and fast route off the island, 
{Brittany Ferries}established a        
 terminal. As business flourished, they
 were joined by{Townsend Thoresen}and  
 the recently privatized{Sealink.      
{  235,000 vehicles and 970,000        
{passengers}per year are carried over  
 the English Channel. Sealink sail to  
{Cherbourg, Jersey}and{Guernsey,       
 Townsend Thoresen to{Le Havre}and     
{Cherbourg,}and Brittany Ferries to{St 
{Malo.}Aboard many of the ships are    
 bars, video games, observation decks, 
 lounges and cinemas, as well as banks,
 gift shops and restaurants.
