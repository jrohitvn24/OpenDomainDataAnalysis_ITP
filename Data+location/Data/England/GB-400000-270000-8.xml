		<content>  The area is of an undulating nature, 
 and this topography has presented     
 difficuties in the construction of    
 transport features. The Birmingham-   
 Worcester canal of 1791-1815 crosses  
 our block and runs through Shortwood  
 Tunnel. The canal carried  many       
 products, and served local needs e.g. 
 bricks, agriculture, needlemaking. In 
 the mid - 19 th. century came the     
 Birmingham - Gloucester Railway, which
 later became part of The Midland      
 Railway, and the L.M.S.R. The railway 
 robbed the canal of its trade, and    
 today the main industry of the canal  
 is tourism. The main road in the block
 connects Alvechurch to Birmingham and 
 Redditch.Recently excavation work on  
 the nearby M42 began, and this will   
 cut across the north of the parish on 
 its completion in 1986.
