 1983. A Morris 8 started the display.

 45p for{children}and{senior citizens. 
   The exhibition consists mainly of   
{veteran cars and bicycles.}There are  
 also{motor cycles and farm vehicles}on
 show. An interesting display depicts  
{rural life}during the last century.   
 There is a large exhibition of{street 
{jewellery,}showing advertisements from
 the past few decades.                 
    Occasionally the Centre exhibits a 
 particular vehicle for a short period 
 of time.{Thrust 2}was displayed       
 recently, and visitors found this very
 interesting. Many thousands of people 
 enjoyed the variety of displays that  
 the Heritage Centre offers.           
   There is a small{gift shop}which    
 sells postcards and souvenirs.
