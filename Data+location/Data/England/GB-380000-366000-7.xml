		<content>  During our survey, a total of thirty 
 houses were involved.We found that    
 everybody was only too pleased to     
 participate once they knew what the   
 project incurred.                     
 Relating to the questionaire, question
 1, number 1, we found that the        
 majority were owners of their homes   
 with only a small minority being      
 tenants.                              
 The average number of occupants was   
 4-5, made up of families rather than  
 couples.Six of the houses involved had
 grand-parents living with their       
 families.It is also interesting to    
 know that all six houses were farms   
 and that these farms had been passed  
 down from generation to generation.   
 The age of the houses varied quite    
 considerably.The oldest was a         
 farmhouse and barn dating back some   
 400 years.                            </content>
