		<content> There are different styles of houses  
 in Seagry .The earliest was built in  
 1600 and the most recent in 1983.     
 Most houses were built for farm       
 workers.But three large houses were   
 built for wealthy land owners.        
 Seales Court was built in 1600.It was 
 made of stone with stone mullions and 
 fifty six windows.The original oak    
 front door is still there.A stone     
 dovecote is still there.Badgers Croft,
 built in 1897,used to be an old post  
 office and before that a school. It is
 a red bricked cottage with slate roof,
 wooden windows and two chimneys and   
 has a new extension built in 1985.
