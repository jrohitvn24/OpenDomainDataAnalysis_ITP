		<title>12GOLDHANGER - MALDON ROAD</title>
		<content> Maldon Road is the base of a  triangle
 with the Square as the apex.Maldon    
 Road is called Maldon Road because it 
 leads into Maldon. Many of the        
 buildings along Maldon Road are at the
 edge of a council estate called Hall  
 estate.In Maldon Road there is a Post 
 Office _Cum_Shop. Maldon Road runs    
 through a lot of farmland.Maldon Road 
 is the main road in to Goldhanger.At  
 the end of Maldon Road there is a     
 bridge called Wash Bridge.It is called
  Wash Bridge because I think it is    
 where people used to wash in the olden
 days if they had no water.
