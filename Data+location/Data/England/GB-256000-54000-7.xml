{Dolerite.}It is of volcanic origin and
{Devon County Council}are the main     
 purchasers.800 tons a day are taken   
 away,after it has been processed into 
 different categories,for various road 
 surfaces.                             
  Fifteen men are employed,as opposed  
 to fifty who worked there before      
 machinery took over.Explosives are    
 used to obtain the Dolerite and the   
 quarry is concentric in shape,and     
 stepped in order to avoid serious rock
 falls.Water is pumped out regularly.  
  In 30yrs the quarry will treble in   
 size.The woodland will be completely  
 destroyed,but the company does attempt
 to return the land to a natural state.
