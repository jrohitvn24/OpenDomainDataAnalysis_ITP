		<content> My dad own's a shop in Hodge Lea      
 called Handy Supermarket.When he      
 bought it the man left it in a right  
 mess.The mess was out of date food,   
  bad food. The floor was dirty and we 
 had to remove the shevles and price   
 the food properly.Then the big day    
 came when we opened the shop. Nearly  
 all the people congratulated us for   
 doing a good job. We bought all sorts 
 of new foods like, baked beans,       
 butter, frozen foods and the kinds of 
 things people need every day. He also 
 sells newspapers and comics.The       
 closing times are  Mon,Fri its        
 6.00,am to 7.00pm and on Sat its      
 7.00am to 6.00pm. On Sundays people   
 have to wait till 12.00pm so they can 
 buy our spirits. And on Sundays its   
 close at 2.00pm. Our main attraction  
 is the hire-a-video, we have a large  
 selection.                            </content>
