		<content>    King's Sutton is a very lucky      
 village because just outside, on the  
 Charlton Road, there is a sports      
 ground.   The kind villagers donated  
 the money towards making it.          
    The three tennis courts are private
 and belong to the Tennis Club, but    
 only one of the players  has to be    
 a member.   About 36 members come to  
 play on Sundays and their team is one 
 of the very best locally.             
    There is also a  pitch where       
 cricket and football are played on    
 Saturdays.   There are over one       
 hundred members of the Football Club  
 and the teams are well supported.     
 Both the cricket and football teams   
 are well up their leagues.   There is 
 even a successful rounders team!
