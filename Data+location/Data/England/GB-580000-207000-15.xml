		<title>15A Local Shop Survives</title>
		<content>    There was only one shop in our area
 : a general store,newsagents and      
 confectioners at Langford.The         
 shopkeeper had been able to survive   
 the competition from the supermarkets 
 of nerby towns but life was difficult.
 She survived by keeping items people  
 needed everyday,like milk and beans   
 and could not run out of and so needed
 to shop locally.Sweets,Newspapers and 
 Icecreams brought in people passing   
 through the village who also bought   
 other items.The shop was a friendly   
 meeting place for people who liked to 
 chat and shop.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
