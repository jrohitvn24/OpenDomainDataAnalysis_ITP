		<content> Today, the trees are about 80 years   
 old, they are largely deciduous but   
 some conifers have been planted to    
 give shade. The woods contain an area 
 of "wet meadow", which was  farmed    
 until 1940 ,when it became neglected  
 and trees grew.Today, it has been     
 cleared and the grass is cut for      
 hay.Wild flowers such as cowslips now 
 grow there.There is also an area of   
 "heath land" which was damaged by the 
 steam trains travelling through and   
 burning the heather. Today, this has  
 been cleared and there are now        
 heathers and bilberries growing.There 
 are a variety of wild flowers to be   
 found including Lily of the Valley,   
 wild honeysuckle,carawheat etc. The   
 pond contains many insects and plants.
 Mudtrack,deer,squirrels,shrew,moles,  
 weasels etc:can be found happily      
 surviving in this environment.        </content>
