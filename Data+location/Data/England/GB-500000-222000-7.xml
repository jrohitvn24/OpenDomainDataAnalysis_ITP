 Mentioned in the Domesday Book.The    
 church building has been on this spot 
 for more than 900 years.The tower is  
 thought to have been built in the 14th
 or 15th century and has 6 bells.The   
 font is Norman.The memorial stone     
 pulpit was installed in 1879.The Nave 
 is 59 feet long and is divided from   
 the choir stalls and sanctuary by the 
 carved wooden screen.The part         
 underneath the tower was walled in    
 during 1983 to provide a kitchen,an   
 upstairs ante room,an office and      
 toilets.There is an electrically      
 pumped pipe organ with 2 manuals and  
 pedals.The church is in need of       
 restoration and an appeal is to be    
 launched to raise 80,000 pounds.A     
 recent Flower Festival raised about   
 1,100 pounds.
