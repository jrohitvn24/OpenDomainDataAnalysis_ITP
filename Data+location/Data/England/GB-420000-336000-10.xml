		<title>10THE LOST VILLAGE</title>
		<content>    Near Longford village there are the
 remains of a lost village. It was     
 called Bupton. Bupton was mentioned in
 the original Domesday book.           
    The sign of the lost village is a  
 few circular bumps in the field at    
 Bupton corner.                        
    The lost village had a manor. Now  
 there is nothing there.               
    The villages were deserted because 
 the ground was not good enough or they
 ran out of food from the trees and    
 plants. Some villages died because    
 most of the people died of illnees or 
 because of the changeover from arable 
 to sheep and dairy farming.           
    There are lost villages all over   
 Derbyshire.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
