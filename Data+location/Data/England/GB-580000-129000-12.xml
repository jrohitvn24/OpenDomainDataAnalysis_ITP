		<title>12FARMING - IDEN GREEN</title>
		<content>{ORCHARDS:}Two at Yew Tree Farm, One   
 at Hope House. A large area of orchard
 existed on the East side of Standen   
 Street until the early 1970's when the
 land was sold off in small leisure    
 plots to individual purchasers        
 although no planning permission had   
 been granted and the plots were       
 virtually useless. Initially some     
 purchasers visited their land to pick 
 the{apples}but now the area is        
 overgrown and derelict and it is      
 impossible to envisage its future use.
 New orchards have been planted on the 
 West side of Standen Street.          
    Two{Cherry}orchards, one at West   
 Cross, one at Iden Green have been    
 grubbed out since 1980 owing the high 
 labour costs.                         
{SOFT FRUIT:} There is a{vineyard}at   
 Laurel Nurseries, Dingleden, and      
{blackcurrants}at West Cross.          </content>
