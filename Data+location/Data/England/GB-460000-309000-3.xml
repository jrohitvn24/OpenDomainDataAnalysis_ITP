		<content>{SYSTON PARISH CHURCH (built 1430)     
   Many years ago there was a big,     
 annual Church Festival, but now Syston
 Carnival has taken its place.         
   The ceiling of the church is thought
 to be carved by the monks from        
 Ulverscroft Priory.                   
   The church has 20 services a week   
 and 4 on Sunday.The graveyard is      
 closed and a new cemetery has been    
 opened on Barkby Road. Approx. 50     
 babies are baptised each year. This is
 an increase on ten years ago.
