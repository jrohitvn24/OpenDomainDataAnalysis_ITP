		<content> Recent concern about the use of       
 chemical fertilisers, with the        
 possible adverse effects on our health
 has prompted farmers and gardeners to 
 produce food by more natural means.The
 East Hants Self Sufficiency Group is a
 local branch of the Henry Doubleday   
 Research Association,the largest body 
 of organically minded farmers and     
 gardeners in Britain.Their aims are to
 interest and inform people about the  
 keeping of livestock and about fruit  
 and vegetable growing by organic      
 means.Talks and demonstrations are    
 arranged on skills such as cheese     
 making,spinning,weaving,butchery,and  
 pottery.Exhibitions are held which    
 attract many visitors who are able to 
 purchase livestock and organically    
 grown produce.Information on land     
 management,greenhouse work,natural    
 energy and related items is available.</content>
