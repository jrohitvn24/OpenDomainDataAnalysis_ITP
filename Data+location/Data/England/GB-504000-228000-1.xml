		<title>01THE CLAPPERS</title>
		<content> The Clappers is a prominent spur of   
 the Chiltern Hills. The top is crowned
 with beech trees, which were planted  
 together with some conifers, during   
 the 19th century. The sides are       
 covered{with fairly thick scrub which 
 grew considerably after the rabbit    
 population had been decimated by the  
 introduction of myxamatosis in the    
 l960's. Rabbits are now breeding in   
 the area.                             
 This local landmark was donated by the
 W A Robertson Memorial Fund, in 1939, 
 to the National Trust. His mother     
 wished to commemorate the death of her
 son who was killed in the First World 
 War. Since that time the site has been
 administered by the Trust. In recent  
 years a number of improvements have   
 been made.At the entrance to the site
