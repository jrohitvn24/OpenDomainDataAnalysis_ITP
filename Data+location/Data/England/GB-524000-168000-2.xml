		<content> Mitcham is well known for the May     
 Queen.I am in the May Queen I started 
 when I was 5 and I was a fairy for a  
 year and then I was a Lily of the     
 Valley which is a  green ribbon with a
 white dress and green flowers to hold 
 and to wear in your hair. When you are
 12 you go in a pick to be the May     
 Queen but if you are not it then you  
 are Prince Charming or Lady in Waiting
 if you are not that then its your last
 year. They have a  little fancy dress 
 for the little boys and the May Queen 
 has all different colours. We visit   
 all different places and we go to old 
 peoples homes  and we take part in the
 Mitcham Carnival.I am the Lavender    
 Lady this year.The Mayor comes and    
 crowns the new queen every year.
