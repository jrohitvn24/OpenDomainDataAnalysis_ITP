		<title>05ST. AUBIN'S VILLAGE</title>
		<content> St. Aubin's village and harbour is one
 of the most attractive places in      
 Jersey. At one time it was the        
 principal harbour of the island. The  
 first harbour was built in the 16th C.
  Privateers brought their booty here. 
 The captured goods were stored in     
 the cellar of the Court House, now an 
 inn. In later years the harbour and   
 the adjacent bay were used for boat   
 building. There are still a few boat  
 yards around the harbour today. The   
 buildings of the village, constructed 
 on the hillsides above the harbour    
 make an attractive skyline. There are 
 now a number of hotels and many       
 restaurants, but the village is       
 still a place for family homes. The   
 little back streets, much admired by  
 tourists, are the playground for many 
 children. The harbour is a focus for  
 many local pleasure boat owners.      </content>
