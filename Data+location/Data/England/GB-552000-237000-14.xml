 There is a market in the town square  
 on Tuesdays and Saturdays. There are  
 food stalls, stalls selling clothes   
 and stalls selling second hand books  
 and tools.                            
                                       
 There used to be a pig market. A new  
 Waitrose store is being built on the  
 site. There was also a cattle market  
 but this is now the site of a Building
 Society.                              
                                       
 When there is no market the town      
 square is used as a car park.         
                                       
 Beside the market square is the town  
 hall in a timberframed building and   
 the lbrary in the former corn         
 exchange.                             
                                       </content>
