		<content> The wet, misty weather which prevails 
 for much of the year tends to nurture 
 a stoic attitude within the local     
 population.                           
   Change is not something which is    
 welcomed in this part of the country  
 and newcomers bear the label of       
 'Grockles' for many years after they  
 first move in.                        
   People in the district are perhaps  
 not so widely travelled as in other   
 parts of Devon (perhaps there is some 
 link here with the poor network of    
 roads and the resulting difficulty in 
 journeying to any of the county's     
 major towns).  Thus, there tends to be
 a very insular and parochial outlook. 
   Superstition and folk-lore,         
 therefore, still play a major part in 
 the lives of local residents.
