		<title>07THE PUBLIC IN MICHELMERSH</title>
		<content>      Four of the fourth year went to  
{Michelmersh}to interview the public.  
 They interviewed four people.         
      The pupils discovered a wall     
 behind which was the old waterworks   
 which was demolished in 1982. They    
 interviewed a man who used to work in 
 the waterworks who now lives in what  
 was a tied cottage. A tied cottage is 
 a cottage that goes with a job. On the
 tied cottage is a plaque on which was 
 inscribed S.H.W.W.Co. which means     
 South Hants Water Works Company.      
      Villagers feel that considerable 
 areas of the old-type countryside have
 been destroyed by the extractive      
 industries, and not as yet matched by 
 subsequent restoration.               
      Out of the four people           
 interviewed most of them noticed there
 were more houses being built. Two     
 relied on the local bus service.      </content>
