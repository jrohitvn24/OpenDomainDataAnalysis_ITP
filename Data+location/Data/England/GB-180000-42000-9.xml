		<content> The southern region of Truro contains 
 the greater quantity of educational   
 institutions; there are 3 primary,1   
 secondary, and 2 private schools. Kea 
 Primary school serves the rural areas 
 whereas Bosvigo serves the main urban 
 area - with about 8 schools in Truro  
 for this 5 to 11 age group, these 2   
 schools have their own nucleus of     
 settlements. Teachers cover a wide    
 range of subjects with a class of one 
 particular age group. Sports resources
 and facilities are limited due to the 
 size of the schools. In this area     
 Secondary education comprises 1 state 
 school,Richard Lander, which serves   
 50% of the total urban and rural      
 school population of Truro, and 2     
 private schools, Truro School and     
 Truro High School, all of which cater 
 for 11 to 18 year olds.
