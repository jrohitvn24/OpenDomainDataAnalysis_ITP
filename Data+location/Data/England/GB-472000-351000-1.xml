		<title>01Impressions of the area.</title>
		<content> The area appears to be a traditional  
{rural}one; flat open{farmland}with    
 occasional wooded areas, pleasant red 
 brick cottages and rather             
 unsophisticated farms, but closer     
 inspection reveals a different picture
 in some parts.                        
 Rolleston is indeed a traditional     
 village with farming its principal    
 'raison d'etre'. Farming is important 
 also in Fiskerton and Morton but here 
 there are many more incomers and the  
 majority of houses are owned by people
 in well paid employment. A minority of
 famillies have lived in the villages  
 for generations, but their influence  
 on the community is dwindling. Apart  
 from employment in{farming, small     
{industry and services,}most people    
 work outside the area.{Course fishing 
 and{horse racing}attract many visitors
 to the parishes.                      </content>
