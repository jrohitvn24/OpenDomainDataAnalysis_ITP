		<title>19ESCOMB SAXON CHURCH</title>
		<content> It is distinctive that the church has 
 little History.  It i a small, rather 
 obscure, Church preserved by its lack 
 of importance, yet a memorial to the  
 hopes and aspirations of many         
 generations.                          
    It was built at least as early as  
 675 AD with a nave about 43ft. by     
 14ft. with high side walls and a      
 chancel 10ft. square, a plan unique to
 the NE.  Much of the material used in 
 its construction was salvaged from the
 Roman settlement at Vinovia.          
    It has been restored three times,  
 in about 667, 1897, and in 1964 when  
 it was refurnished to be used for     
 regular worship.  The Victorian       
 Church, that replaced it for a while, 
 from 1863, was demolished in 1971.    
    The Church suppurts a rare colony  
 of tiny Whiskered Bats, the subject of
 a study by Durham Bat group.          </content>
