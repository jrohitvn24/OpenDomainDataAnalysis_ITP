		<title>05Computers and Videos</title>
		<content> One of the greatest changes in our    
 area in the last 5 years has come with
 home computers and video films.       
 Micro-computers are now fairly common 
 and in our class of 30 children       
 exactly half had a home computer      
 whilst 20 had a home video and all had
 a colour TV.  By far the most usual   
 type of use for the home computer     
 wasin arcade games.  The video was    
 used more specifically for watching   
 adventure films hired from local      
 rental stores and also for taping     
 off-air broadcasts.
