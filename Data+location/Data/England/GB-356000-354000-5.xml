 Most of the area is grassland and with
 the introduction of milk quotas (1984)
 dairy farmers became more aware of the
 need for economic use of grass for    
 summer grazing and winter silage. The 
 majority of cows are Friesians (black 
 &amp; white), but some Jersey cows are    
 bred by specialist breeders. Cows are 
 milked in parlours. The milk is stored
 in cooled bulk tanks and taken daily  
 to dairies (out of the area) where it 
 is pasteurised for human consumption, 
 or made into butter or cheese.  The   
 surplus is dried and either sold or   
 stored as part of the EEC surplus.    
 Land prices before the milk           
 quotas rose to Â£3000 per acre but have
 now fallen to Â£2000 - Â£1500. Dairy    
 cows are about Â£500 each with top     
 quality making considerably more.     </content>
