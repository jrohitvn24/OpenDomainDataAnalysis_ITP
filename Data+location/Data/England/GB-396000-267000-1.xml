		<title>01Bromsgrove Town</title>
		<content> Bromsgrove is an average size town    
 with a population of just over{43,600}
 people.The High St is now a paved     
 shopping area and looks very          
 nice.There are a lot of shops in      
 Bromsgrove,some people go to          
 Redditch.People work at the main      
 factories like Garringtons,Bayers and 
 B.W.G.Many go to work at British      
 Leyland in Longbridge or elsewhere in 
 Birmingham or Redditch.Bromsgrove has 
 its own running track and swimming    
 pool.Bromsgrove is less busy than     
 Redditch.Bromsgrove has changed a lot 
 over the years.A few years ago a by   
 pass was opened.Recently the M5 has   
 been closed and there have been a lot 
 of traffic jams.This has made the by  
 pass very hard to cross.A lot of      
 people live in Bromsgrove but work    
 elsewhere.
