		<title>06COMMONWOOD HOUSE</title>
		<content>{Common Wood House}is about 74 years   
 old. It is a pretty house that used   
 to belong to Mr and Mrs Alan. The     
 Alans built the house with a man      
 called Mr Downer in 1911. It took 30  
 years to build the house in the Tudor 
 style of architecture. The Alans      
 decided to build in a squash court and
 an Italian style temple so they made  
 lots of journeys to Italy and looked  
 at a temple there. When the war came  
 they moved out and some Americans     
 moved in and made it into a night club
 for American officers. In 1955 there  
 was a fire and one third of the house 
 was destroyed. Mr Downer was asked to 
 restore the building. Some years later
 the house was bought by a London      
 company who made many alterations and 
 modifications and turned it into five 
 flats and two houses. The squash court
 is likely to be demolished soon.      </content>
