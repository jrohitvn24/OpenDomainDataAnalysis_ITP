		<title>07Entertainment around Kilby</title>
		<content> Because the grid is primarily         
 agricultural land and since the area  
 is close to the Urban Centres of      
 Wigston,Oadby and Leicester           
 entertainment within the block is very
 limited. Apart from the usual annual  
 events in Kilby there is little in the
 way of organised entertainment. There 
 is only one Public House in the       
 block,"The Dog And Gun" in Kilby      
 itself.There is,however,ample         
 opportunity for outdoor recreation    
 on the neumerous Public Footpaths or  
 Bridle Ways within the block. There   
 is also the open space at Wistow      
 Park and fishing in either the River  
 Sence or Grand Union Canal.In         
 general the lack of organised         
 entertainment in the block is no      
 handicap for there is a vast range    
 available in the nearby Urban         
 Centres..                             </content>
