		<content>{Mrs Mary Ferguson}has lived in the    
 village all her life.  The only       
 medicine Mrs Ferguson can recall was  
 brimstone and treacle, this cured all 
 ills.  When she was young most people 
 in the village would go to the Village
 Institute for their entertainment, the
 men could play billiards and there    
 were also dances, whist drives and    
 beetle drives. A pony trap was used to
 go into Thirsk and Mrs Ferguson had a 
 small motor bike which cost her a     
 shilling a year to licence.           
{Mr Herbert Hebdon }                   
 During World War 11 Mr Hebdon and his 
 wife looked after two evacuees who    
 came from Sunderland.  Mr Hebdon a    
 farmer's son preferred to work in wood
 and was employed for many years by the
 "Mouseman" at Kilburn.
