  Alumwell is the name of our area.It  
 is so called as many years ago there  
 was a well with water rich in the     
 mineral Alum.                         
  On the large open site next to the M6
 motorway there are four schools: the  
 nursery, Infants, Junior, and         
 Comprehensive. All of the schools     
 share the name Alumwell. This can lead
 to a lot of problems. If letters are  
 not properly addressed they go to the 
 wrong school. Often people call at the
 wrong school because they do not read 
 the notice boards carefully.          
  Although we have the M6 motorway next
 to us we are very lucky because we    
 have the best and biggest playing     
 fields in the whole of Walsall.
