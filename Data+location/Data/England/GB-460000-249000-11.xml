		<title>11The Church Fete.</title>
		<content>June22nd dawned after days of unsettled
weather and the sun shone.Unfortunately
it was a false dawn and before the 3pm.
opening of the fete it was anything but
pleasant. The fete was opened by Mr    
A.Loney, until recently churchwarden   
and soon to leave the village.The usual
stalls were in evidence-produce and    
white elephant, bottles and            
cakes,nearly-new and plants;plus       
refreshments,Grand Draw and jumble.The 
bad weather seriously interfered with  
the maypole dancing and children's     
games.Indeed, such conditions made     
Mr.and Mrs.John Sheppard's permission  
to use their beautiful garden even more
generous than usual.Yet at the end,when
fewer than normal had attended, when   
takings on the gate were necessarily   
lower, the profit was little different 
from the previous year with its        
glorious sunshine - over 600 pounds.   </content>
