		<title>02Schools in Barton</title>
		<content>In the village of Barton there are two 
denominational primary schools         
situated about one mile apart. There is
also a County Primary school in        
Catforth. Although the overall         
population is fairly stable, the number
of children has decreased considerably 
in the past ten years with the result  
that the Local Education Authority has 
considered the Church of England school
for closure. The C of E authorities    
have countered with proposals for      
amalgamating the R.C. school with      
their own. This resulted in much local 
discussion and the formation of action 
committees during 1984.                
                                       
Although the proposals have been       
shelved for the present there is still 
concern that the area may lose one or  
more of its schools during this decade.
