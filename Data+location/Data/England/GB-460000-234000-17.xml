		<content> There is only one church in Westbury, 
 St.Augustine's. It is C. of E. so     
 other denominations travel either to  
 Brackley or Buckingham where there are
 RomanCatholic, Methodist and other    
 churches. In the 19th. and early      
 20th.c. the church was at the heart of
 the village and nearly everyone went  
 to church, often twice on Sundays.The 
 choir was important and a source of   
 great pride even with long Wednesday  
 practices after working all day.There 
 was no work on Sunday except for those
 who had to tend animals.Today there is
 a core of about 10 families attending 
 regularly with 20 to 30 at an average 
 service.A recently started children's 
 group is involving more youngsters in 
 the services.The present vicar Rev.J.G
 Harford continues the work of Jordanus
 first vicar in 1224,though with 3     
 extra churches to look after.         </content>
