		<title>19RESTORATION IN WILLINGDON</title>
		<content>   Crumbling cement facing has been    
 removed from a house at the Wish Hill 
 end of Old Barn Close to reveal an    
 attractive flint wall. On the same    
 property a boundary wall of flint has 
 been built from the house to a garage 
 which has been erected in its garden. 
   The high flint wall bounding "Five  
 Gables" at the junction of Church     
 Street and Wish Hill has been largely 
 rebuilt. Two large Georgian houses    
 have been extensively restored, one at
 the Wish Hill end of Upper King's     
 Drive, the other close by, facing the 
 Post Office.                          
   These are recent renovations and    
 probably indicate that wealthier      
 people have been attracted to Upper   
 Willingdon. In any case, it is evident
 there is a strong desire amongst the  
 residents to conserve and improve the 
 area.                                 </content>
