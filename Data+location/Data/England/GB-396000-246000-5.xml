		<content> The pipeline runs through Fawley to   
 Southampton to Wolverhampton for Esso 
 Oil.Farmers are compensated if they   
 dig in their land.Work is done with   
 four gangs of men.They work from      
 Monday till Friday and spend the      
 weekend at home.It started on the 1st 
 April to early July.Down in Lower Moor
 ,by the railway line there is a hole  
 with pipes around the edge which were 
 yellow and grey pipes in the          
 ground.When it rained it was awefully 
 muddy and they had to have a ramp     
 which caused traffic jams and so they 
 had to have some traffic lights to    
 stop the traffic jams.Our local farmer
 is called Edward Righton.He was       
 notified last year about proposed     
 work his land and the B 8084.
