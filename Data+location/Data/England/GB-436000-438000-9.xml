		<title>09MRS. ENGLAND'S DAY</title>
		<content> Mrs. England sleeps until 08.00. She  
 does the housework after breakfast and
 finishes her chores around 11.00, and 
 then goes shopping. At about noon she 
 prepares lunch, and after lunch visits
 her friend, or goes out walking. She  
 arrives back at 16.00 to prepare tea. 
 She and her family finish tea at      
 18.00. Mrs. England may then do some  
 gardening.                            
 She watches Television until about    
 23.00 and then goes to bed.           
                                       
 She has lived in Thorner for 13 years.
 Mrs. England enjoys living in Thorner,
 and is a member of the Historical     
 Society in the village.               
                                       
 Mrs. England rarely leaves the        
 village, except to occasionally shop  
 in Leeds.
