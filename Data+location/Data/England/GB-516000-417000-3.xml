		<content> The whole of tis area is{dominated by 
{industry.}Once an area of drained     
 marsh used for farming is now mainly  
 industry. Land cover is either being  
 used by industry at the moment or is  
 waiting for industrial development in 
 the future. The main industries are   
 connected with{oil refining,transport 
{or storage.}The advantages of the area
 for these industries are that they are
 close to the{deep water port}of       
 Immingham for{importing petroleum,}the
 land is fairly{flat and cheap because 
{of its marshy nature}and there are now
{good road and rail links}with other   
 parts of Britain. A list of industries
 would include ;Lindsey Oil Refinery,  
 Texaco Calor Gas Storage, Petrofina,  
 Humber Sea and Land Services, various 
 transport firms and a large area of   
 undeveloped land owned by the C.E.G.B.
