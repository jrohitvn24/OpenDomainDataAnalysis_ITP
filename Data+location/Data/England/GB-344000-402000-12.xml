		<title>12Leisure Activities</title>
		<content>Many homes displayed a wide variety of 
leisure activities in which they took  
part in at home. Gardening was the     
major pastime however reading,         
knitting, sewing and walking also      
provedular activities. The residents   
felt that the development of leisure   
activities in the home were important  
due to the lack of facilities in the   
area.                                  
    With regard to leisure activities  
outside the home, residents found      
themselves travelling outside the area 
to the nearby towns. There pursuits    
included model making, trade union     
activities, keep fit, air training     
corps and horse riding.                
    The general lack of recreational   
facilities for the young is a major    
concern of the residents and some blame
this for the recent increase in crimes 
such as car taking and house breaking. </content>
