		<content> In this area there are no big         
{factories}or other large places of    
 work. Most of the population travel to
 other parts of Sherborne or to nearby 
 towns like{Yeovil}for their work.     
 There are two small factories near the
 junction of Bristol Road and the A.30.
 One of these, employing about 70      
 people at the peak of the season,     
 makes{carbonated and soft drinks,}    
 bottles Guiness and imports wine. The 
 other, smaller business, manufactures 
 gloves.{Glove-making}used to be an    
 industry for which the area was noted.
 There are also a few very{small       
{workshops}in the area including the   
 following businesses: tool-grinding,  
 wood preservation, builder's yard,    
 coach hire and a motor-cycle repair   
 workshop.
