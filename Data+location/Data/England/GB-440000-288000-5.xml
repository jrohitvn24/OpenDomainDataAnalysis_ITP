		<content> Mr.Hunt designed his house and has    
 done most of the building work. He    
 used mainly old materials so it looks 
 as if it dates from 1784.The oakbeams 
 on the lounge ceiling are 300 years   
 old and come from  an old ship. The   
 bricks are 200 years old and some     
 haave footprints of animals on        
 them.The chimney pots and tiles are   
 over 60 years old .He bought these    
 materials from a special shop in      
 Coventry and an old school.Owing to   
 building regulations he used new wood 
 for the staircese and roof. The half  
 acre site was one of eight plots given
 by Thomas Orral to his employees      
 200 years ago to grow vegetables.The  
 house has facilities such as modern   
 plumbing and electricity bbbut still  
 has an attractive olden look to it.
