		<content> By road Preesall is 10 miles from     
 Blackpool,6 miles from                
 Poulton-le-Fylde,15 from Lancaster and
 10 from Garstang.The roads are        
 reasonable,the A588 passing to the    
 south-east.However neither Preesall   
 nor Pilling are on the way from some- 
 where to anywhere so there is no      
 passing traffic.There is a toll-bridge
 on the main road between Preesall and 
 Blackpool,Shard Bridge,which seems to 
 deter some people from coming into the
 area.The road to Garstang is built on 
 the "moss"(peat) and therefore tends  
 to be rather hard on cars'            
 suspensions.The road to Lancaster,an  
 ancient route, used to be flooded at  
 high tide until 1982 which again      
 restricted access.There is a passenger
 ferry across the Wyre Estuary from    
 Fleetwood to Knott-End,Adult 40p,Child
 20p.                                  </content>
