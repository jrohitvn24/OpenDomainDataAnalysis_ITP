		<title>02LANDSCAPE OF PLYMTREE</title>
		<content> The Parish of Plymtree is on the whole
 a gently hilly area.  There is one    
 main hill, on one side of which is the
 River Tale and on the other the       
 River Weaver.  The River Clyst also   
 rises on the hill.  The top contour of
 the hill is 122 metres and the lowest 
 contour in the area is 38 metres.     
 There are a few small patches of wood-
 land in the area.  There used to be   
 many orchards, and all the farms made 
 cider, but two in paticular were      
 famous.  Now few farmers make their   
 own cider.   There are some arable    
 fields but most are used for grazing  
 cattle.  Most fields have hedges on   
 Devon banks with large trees growing  
 on them - there are few fences.  Most 
 of the houses are grouped together in 
 the middle of the village but the     
 farms are scattered all over the area.
