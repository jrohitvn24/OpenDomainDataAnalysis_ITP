		<content>   The land farmed as Frampton Court   
 Farm lies on either side of the busy  
 Tewkesbury to Stow-on-the-Wold road.  
 It is a mixed farm, about half of the 
 land is planted to cereal crops mainly
 wheat and barley. The other half is   
 divided equally between silage and hay
 (winter feed for the cattle) and      
 grazing for the dairy herd of         
 Guernseys and Freisians.              
   The milk produced by the cows used  
 to be bottled on the premises but is  
 now collected daily by tanker and     
 taken to the local dairy to be bottled
 and distributed.                      
   The farm is highly mechanised using 
 tractors and much specialised         
 machinery so that the work is done    
 more quickly and effectively.
