		<title>05EMPLOYMENT IN MORETON</title>
		<content> A{survey}of the parents of our class  
 showed that 22% were employed in the  
 service industry(fire,water,cleaning  
 etc.), 18% in local industry, 7% in   
 farming. 24% were professional e.g.   
 (teachers,lecturers,nurses),shops 10%,
 building 7% and 12% were unemployed.  
      An example of light{industry}in  
 Moreton is Cotswold Casement, where   
 they have made windows since 1888.    
 They make windows with steel or       
 aluminium frames, the latter being    
 cheaper. They do not make their own   
 glass but a firm called Solar Glass in
 Coventry supplies them.A Sultan had   
 ordered 800 windows at Â£5000 each for 
 a mansion. The staff is 1 secretary, 1
 director, 1 manager, 2 window fixers  
 and 20 factory workers. A furniture   
{retailing}business said they import   
 their goods from Czechoslovakia,      
 mostly beds and kitchen furniture.    </content>
