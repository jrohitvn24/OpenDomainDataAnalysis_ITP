		<content> Transport to places of work is        
 predominantly by car.Some poeple      
 travel to nearby railway stations such
 as Kidsgrove and Sandbach to catch    
 connections for Inter-City services.  
 In Rode Heath there are regular bus   
 services to the Potteries and         
 Sandbach.In Scholar Green the services
 run to the Potteries and Congleton.   
 The A34 runs through Scholar Green    
 connecting the Potteries to Congleton.
 Rode Heath however is on the junction 
 of the A5011 Knutsford Potteries road 
 and the A533 which runs to Sandbach.  
 Both villages are within easy access  
 of the M6 motorway.
