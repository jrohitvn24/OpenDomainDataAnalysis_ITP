		<title>03A Chiltern Vineyard.</title>
		<content>  A three acre site at Old Luxter's    
Farm has been planted with grape vines.
The site lies on a gentle slope facing 
S.E. and is well sheltered by woods,   
but open to the S.E. thus getting the  
benefit of the sun. Below it the land  
drops some 200 feet to the valley so it
is a well drained site.                
  The rows of vines run eastwards.     
Three types of grape are grown, and are
planted alternately two rows of each   
type. One grape is a heavy cropper,    
another a rich fruity taste and the    
third is of a high quality.            
  Modern stainless steel equipment has 
been installed in the old farm         
outbuildings and includes a small      
laboratory. The largest vat holds 4000 
litres of wine.                        
  The first Â£Chiltern Valley' vintage  
was bottled in 1985 in long necked     
green bottles.                         </content>
