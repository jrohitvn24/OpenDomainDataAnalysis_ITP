		<content> The Halfway House is a public house   
 owned by Donnington's Brewery and     
 tenanted by Mr. and Mrs. D. Marshall  
 who have been there since 1979. They  
 serve  real beers, lager and wines and
 spirits. They also serve a lot of food
 and the Pub is very popular particular
 in the summer when people travel from 
 the nearby towns for an evening in the
 country.                              
 There is a darts team,an occasional   
 cricket team and annual visits from a 
 Morris Dancing team and a jazz band.  
 It is called the Halfway House because
 it is about halfway between the Plough
 Inn at Ford and the Farmer's Arms at  
 Guiting Power.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
