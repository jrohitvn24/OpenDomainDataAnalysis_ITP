		<title>02BERKELEY CASTLE</title>
		<content>  Berkeley Castle, which overlooks the 
 Little Avon River just to the south of
 the town, is said to be the oldest    
 castle in England which is still      
 inhabited. There has probably been a  
 castle of some sort on the site since 
 Norman times but the present castle   
 building dates from the end of the    
 12th century and was built by Robert  
 Fitzhardinge on the orders of Henry   
 II. Edward II was imprisoned there in 
 1327 in the care of Lord Berkeley. On 
 September 21,1327, Edward was murdered
 by his guards, Sir Thomas Gourney and 
 Lord Maltravers. The castle is still  
 owned by the Berkeley family who also 
 own much of the farm land in the area.
  One curious feature of the parish    
 church, St Mary's, is that the tower  
 is built separately some 100 yards    
 away, lest it be of advantage to      
 anyone beseiging the castle.          </content>
