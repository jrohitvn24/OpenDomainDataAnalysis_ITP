		<title>11A DIPTFORD FARMERS DAY</title>
		<content> The farmer gets up at six o'clock, he 
 gets the{cows}in and puts them in the 
 yard.  After checking the machinery he
 lets the cows in and some of them step
 on to the platforms. The farmer cleans
 the udders, so the milk does not get  
 dirty. Then the farmer puts  on the   
 milking  clusters. The  milk  goes    
 from the cow into a glass jar. When   
 the glass jar fills up it goes into a 
 cooler.  Later a tanker will come and 
 tke the milk away.  After milking the 
 farmer has his breakfast, then he     
 clears the slurry into a pit and then 
 feeds the calves. He fertilises his   
 land to grow good grass. Then he goes 
 and checks the {sheep.} He mends      
 broken fences and hedges. After lunch 
 he does odd jobs like mending broken  
 machinery and prehaps {crops} spraying
 untill it gets dark. Then home to bed.
