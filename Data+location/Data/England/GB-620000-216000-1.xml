		<title>01Our Area</title>
		<content> The landscape of our area is a mixture
 of residential land,marsh and         
 farmland.Just over a twelfth or one   
 square kilometre is residential,the   
 rest is open country.Our area of sea  
 is a part of the North Sea.The        
 farmland is mainly arable,that means  
 it is used for crops such as peas     
 and cereals.There is some grazing land
 as well as arable land.Sheep graze on 
 the marsh land.Cows graze on the land 
 near Holland Brook.Holland Brook      
 used to be a larger estuary called    
 Gunfleet.When it has rained heavily or
 snow has melted,the marshes usually   
 become flooded.Quite a lot of people  
 who live in our area are retired.Many 
 of these people live in bungalows     
 because they do not enjoy going up and
 down stairs.
