		<content> We live in a rural area. Our block is 
 mainly agricultural but also includes 
 three villages and part of a small    
 market town. Many people work outside 
 the area, although the market town    
 provides jobs in offices and shops.It 
 also has four main factories,one of   
 which produces cheese, milk supplies  
 being obtained from local dairy farms.
 However recently there has been a     
 major switch locally to arable        
 farming.                              
    There are two playschools and two  
 primary schools in our block,a bus    
 provides transport for children from  
 other villages.Most families have one 
 or possibly two cars and there is a   
 daily bus service to larger towns     
 nearby.Ours is a peaceful area,with   
 little crime.
