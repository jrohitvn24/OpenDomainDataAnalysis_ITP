		<content> The Lea Valley Regional Parks         
 Authority has improved leisure        
 facilities in our area in the past    
 twenty years. At the old mill meadows 
 at Broxbourne there is an old water   
 mill and a slipway for launching small
 boats. By the mill stream there are   
 four chalets which can be rented      
 throughout the summer. There is also a
 circular nature trail which has been  
 designed to include as many birds and 
 plants as possible.                   
 Following the stream round to the main
 river there is a boat centre. Here it 
 is possible to hire canoes, rowing    
 boats, motor boats and luxury narrow  
 boats that sleep four people. There is
 also a waterbus which makes river     
 trips during the summer. On the       
 opposite bank there is a new indoor   
 fun-pool called the Lido.
