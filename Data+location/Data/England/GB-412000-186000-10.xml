		<title>10Haydon Wick  (General)</title>
		<content> In the two square kilometre blocks to 
 the north east of this quiet village  
 of Haydon Wick , is an area which is  
 growing very quickly faster than any  
 other in Thamesdown.                  
                                       
 Up until five or six years ago these  
 two blocks were made up mostly of     
 fields on which beef and dairy cattle 
 grazed.                               
                                       
 Now about half this area has been used
 for building houses and before long we
 expect that the land left will        
 probably be developed for house       
 building as well.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
