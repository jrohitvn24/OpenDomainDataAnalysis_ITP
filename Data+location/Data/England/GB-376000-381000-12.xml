{SUPERNATURAL.                         
 In this block we have discovered three
 tales of the supernatural. In two of  
 the cases the stories have been passed
 down as hear-say, and therefore       
 several versions seem to exist. So    
 although the basic facts stay the same
 the story which has built up around   
 them differs in each version.         
{GHOST SIGHTINGS.                      
 The only intervewee to experience a   
 "sighting" first hand is the owner of 
 "Sovereign Stud". The lady has seen on
 several occasions, in her kitchen, a  
 young man dressed as an Airman and    
 wearing a white silk scarf round his  
 neck. He always faces Northwards, and 
 as she enters the kitchen he looks    
 towards her, smiles and fades away.   
 Despite the experiences, the lady has 
 never felt frightened.                </content>
