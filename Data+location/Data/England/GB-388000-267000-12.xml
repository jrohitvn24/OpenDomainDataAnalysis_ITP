		<title>12ELMBRIDGE SHOPPING HABITS</title>
		<content> This area is very rural with no shops 
 and no regular public transport. There
 is a post office and a small general  
 store nearby. The nearest town,       
 Droitwich, is within 3 miles where    
 most commodities can be bought, most  
 people shop here for their food weekly
 or fortnightly, travelling in their   
 own cars. Some people travel further  
 to shop mostly to Worcester,          
 Kidderminster or Bromsgrove. Two      
 families shop once a month at a       
 wholesale outlet. Many people use the 
 local post office and store for bread 
 and occassionally for items which may 
 have been forgotten. Milk and papers  
 are delivered to most houses. Some    
 people also have deliveries of meat,  
 bread, fruit, vegetables and soft     
 drinks. Very few people in this area  
 buy items from mail order catalouges.
