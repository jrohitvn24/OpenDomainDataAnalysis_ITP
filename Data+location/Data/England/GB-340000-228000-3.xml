		<content> The{school building}has been altered  
 and extended over the years. The      
 earliest recorded use of the building 
 as a school was around 1870, and early
 in the building's life as a school a  
 schoolhouse was added. Part of this   
 house was incorporated in the school  
 early in the 20th century to form an  
 infant's classroom, which in 1972 was 
 superseded by a{prefabricated         
{classroom.}Other improvements include 
 the addition of cloakrooms and a      
 school meals scullery after World War 
 Two and the replacement of the bucket 
 privies by flush toilets in a brick   
 built extension to the cloakroom in   
 1970.The old building was heated by a 
 coke burning{'tortoise' type stove    
 until 1983.Subsequently{Calor Gas }   
 heating was installed. The            
 prefabricated building is heated by   
 electric storage radiators.           </content>
