		<content> If you don't like the programme on one
 side you can put another side on.There
 are four channels on our              
 television,B.B.C. one and two,Border  
 and Channel Four. The last two are    
 independent television companies and  
 show advertisments.You need a         
 television license for a television   
 set and the money goes to the         
 B.B.C..B.B.C stands for the           
 British Broadcasting Corporation.The  
 cost is Â£46 for a coloured set and Â£32
 for a black and white set. Only one   
 license is needed for all the sets in 
 one house or hotel. Most people I know
 have more than one television,so that 
 the members of a family can watch what
 they want.Many people rent television 
 sets and video recorders. The         
 advantage of renting is that when the 
 set goes wrong,the company will come  
 and repair it or replace the set.     </content>
