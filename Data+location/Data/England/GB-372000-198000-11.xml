{An interview with a Parish Councillor.
 A Parish Councillor is elected to look
 after the general welfare of the      
 Parish. The main duties of a Parish   
 Councillor are to look after footpaths
 and make sure that farmers don't      
 plough them up. Stiles must be kept in
 good repair. If street lights are not 
 working a warden is sent to mend them.
 They look out for potholes in the     
 road, smelly drains, untidy gardens,  
 garden bonfires and noisy neighbours. 
 Any serious complaints are referred to
 the County Council.                   
 An important part of the job is to be 
 available to the public and be        
 prepared to follow up their           
 complaints. The thing Dursley's people
 need most is a swimming pool and Cam  
 need medical facilities.              </content>
