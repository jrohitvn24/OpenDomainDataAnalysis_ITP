		<title>08SHOPPING IN CARLTON</title>
		<content> Our block is a{rural}area.There       
 are three{villages,Letwell,Carlton-   
{in-Lindrick and Wallingwells.There}are
 no shops in Wallingwells because the  
 village is too small.There used to be 
 a shop in Letwell,but it is now a     
 saddlery.Also there is a{post office  
 but it only sells{stamps.Carlton has  
 13 local shops,1{supermarket,a        
{surgery,a chemist,a grocers, a bakers,
{a butchers,3 hairdressers,a fruit     
{shop,a cafe,a fish &amp; chip shop,and    
{'Whatmough' which is a newsagents.Also
 in Carlton there is a{Lloyds}bank.If  
 people have transport the most popular
 shop is{Tesco the supermarket in      
 Worksop. But the old people rely on   
 their local shops or{travelling shops 
 like the fruit and vegetable van. I   
 don't think there are many shops for  
 the size of{Carlton.
