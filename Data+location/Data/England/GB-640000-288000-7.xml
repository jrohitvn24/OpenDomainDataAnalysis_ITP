		<title>07The River Waveney.</title>
		<content> The River Waveney has its source in   
Redgrave Fen and flows into the sea    
near Great Yarmouth.Beccles owes its   
existance to the river.In the past the 
river was the main source of trade for 
the town with the herring trade being  
 most important in the middle ages.    
Nowadays a different trade has been    
built up around the river-that is      
tourism.Many holiday makers arrive in  
Beccles on hire boats.                 
A large boat building trade has grown u
on the banks of the river at Beccles.  
The Quay area has been developed to    
cope with the tourist trade. Many      
people living in Beccles own their     
own boat and moor it permantly on the  
river.In the summer they take trips up 
river for the day.The River Waveney is 
still a central part of life in        
Beccles.
