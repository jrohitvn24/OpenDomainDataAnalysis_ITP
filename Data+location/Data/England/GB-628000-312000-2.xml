{ Little Plumstead}is a small commuter 
 village on the outskirts of the City  
 of Norwich.It contains a mixture of   
 housing with a large number of        
 bungalows dating back to the 1930's   
 when development began to take place  
 in Norfolk.Many of the properties have
 large plots of land, which was very   
 cheap at the time of their being      
 built.Apart from a few local shops,   
 the people of the village have to rely
 upon visits to Norwich for their main 
 shopping.Greater Plumstead is         
 the site for a large{Mental Hospital  
{serving}the Norwich area.
