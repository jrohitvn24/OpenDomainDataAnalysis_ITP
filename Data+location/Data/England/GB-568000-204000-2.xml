		<title>02NEW ROAD LINKS IN CHELMSFORD</title>
		<content>{The summer of 1985}sees a number of   
 new roads being constructed through   
 Chelmsford and its environs,in order  
 to try to alleviate the town's traffic
 problems.                             
 The main 'bottleneck' on the A12 trunk
 route is at the{roundabout adjacent to
{the Army &amp; Navy}public house.Princes  
 Road (built as a by-pass in 1932)     
 meets the Baddow-Parkway flyover here.
 After many planning difficulties, a   
{new by-pass is being constructed      
 around the town to the south and east.
                                       
 The development of residential housing
 areas around the northern edge of the 
 town({Chelmer Village,Newland's Spring
{and North Springfield})has encouraged 
 the building of a series of roads to  
 link up the centre of the town (the   
{Chelmer Valley route}) with the new   
 road networks there.                  </content>
