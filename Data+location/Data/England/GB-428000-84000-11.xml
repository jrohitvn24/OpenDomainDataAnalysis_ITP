 been a museum for 4 years.There are   
 about 200 clocks including the        
 watches. The oldest clock was made in 
 1590.The French bubble clock has a    
 matching wall bracket.The Dutch       
 Marquet long case clock has a Dutch   
 striking movement with alarm.The owner
 of the museum mends his clocks on the 
 premises.Dr Hooke,who was responsible

 only two miles away from the museum.
