		<title>11A Day in Keith's Life.</title>
		<content> My mum woke me and I had my breakfast 
 at quarter to eight. I cleaned my     
 teeth and washed before taking Scamp, 
 our dog, for a walk. I caught the bus 
 to school. I arrived at school at     
 quarter to nine for register. We had  
 hymn practice, maths for an hour and  
 then break when we play games or      
 breakdance. After break we did P.E.   
 and drama. At five to twelve we had   
 dinner. I have a packed lunch, most   
 people have school dinners. After     
 dinner we had an another break, then  
 the M4s went swimming at Glossop Road 
 Baths. After swimming we did our topic
 on lifestyles until home time at      
 twenty five to four. I caught the bus 
 home and took Scamp out. After tea I  
 cycled down to church for choir       
 practice. When I arrived home I       
 practised my trumpet, watched some    
 T.V. and went to bed at nine fifteen. </content>
