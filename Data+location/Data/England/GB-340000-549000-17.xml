		<title>17BRICKWORKS _ BRISCO</title>
		<content> There has been a brickworks here at   
 Brisco since 1934.It was built near a 
 sand pit but this is now exhausted and
 the sand is obtained from Faugh.The   
 bricks are made from a mixture of sand
 and crushed stone together with water 
 and hydrated lime.The mix is computer 
 controlled then subjected to pressure 
 of 3 tons per square inch and cured in
 high pressure steam in an autoclave.  
 Common and facing bricks are made,the 
 latter in either smooth or rough      
 finish in a choice of ten colours.    
 Specials in different shapes can also 
 be ordered.Up to 400,000 bricks a week
 are made here but Mr.Tweddle,the      
 manager for 20 years,said that their  
 business is dependent on the ups and  
 downs of the building trade.20 men    
 work here.Laings own the works.The    
 biggest changes have been in the      
 introduction of automated machinery.  </content>
