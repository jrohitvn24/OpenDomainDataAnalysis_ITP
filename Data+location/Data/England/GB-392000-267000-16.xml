		<title>16FOOTPATHS OF STOKE PRIOR.</title>
		<content> A {footpath }is a dirt track which    
 animals and people have walked for    
 centuries to go the shortest way to   
 church,town or public house. These    
 paths go over all kinds of territory  
 public and private, and on these walks
 you can see more of the countryside's 
 flora and fauna than from roadways.   
     {Worcestershire has more public   
{footpaths that any other county,}about
 four and half kilometres for each     
 square km, but this 12km block has    
 approximately 116km of footpaths and  
 bridleways. However, the area around  
{Stoke Prior}has very few footpaths,   
 and recently another was closed       
 because it went through the site of a 
 newly formed nature reserve and       
 reservoir at Upton Warren.{The only   
{footpaths now }lead from the village  
 to church and to the old Roman        
 Road,today's A38.                     </content>
