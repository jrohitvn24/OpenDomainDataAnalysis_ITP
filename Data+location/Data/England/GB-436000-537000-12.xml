		<title>12Wheatley Hill Traffic Survey</title>
		<content>    On June 3rd 1985 we carried out a  
 traffic survey in{Front Street.}We    
 started at{13.32}and ended at{14.02.} 
    The most common vehicle was the car
 but there were many lorries as well.  
 This was probably due to the fact that
 many of the council houses are being  
 altered and the lorries are delivering
 materials.                            
    There were no large articulated    
 lorries because these use the main    
 road on the edge of the village.      
    Of the{112 cars}we spotted, 29 were
 'A'registered. Only a few of them were
 more than nine years old.             
   {The buses}that passed were going to
{Durham, Hartlepool and Sunderland.}   
 None of the twelve buses in the survey
 had more than nine passengers. Most   
 people seem to travel by car.
