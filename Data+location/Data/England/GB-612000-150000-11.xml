		<title>11Educational Opportunities</title>
		<content>    Education in the villages is       
 provided up to 11 years of age by     
 the state . In the academic year      
 the children attain 12, they commence 
{secondary education.}In the Canterbury
 area, this is a{selective  system     
 where 25% of the children are chosen  
 for an accelerated programme of work  
 at one of Canterbury's 4 selective    
 schools and the remainder go to a     
 local non-selective schools which     
 include Church, Secondary Modern and  
 Bi-lateral schools. An element of     
{parental choice}is intended in the    
 system but usually non-selective      
 children attend their nearest school  
 unless parents are members of a       
 denomination which provides education.

 -est non-selective school at Chartham

 pupils use the bus service or cars.   </content>
