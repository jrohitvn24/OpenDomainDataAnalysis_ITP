		<title>12FRUIT GROWING</title>
		<content>   Several centuries ago much of the   
 eastern part of the grid was covered  
 by orchards  but few now remain       
 although many home-owners have an     
 orchard as part of their gardens.     
   Today some of this fertile land     
 is fruit-farmed on a 'pick-your-own'  
 basis. There are two such farms in the
 area. Kites Nest fruit farm to the    
 north of Blakeney grows strawberry,   
 raspberry, loganberry, tayberry and   
 rhubarb. Although a pick-your-own     
 farm, the fruit can be purchased      
 ready-picked at a slightly higher     
 cost. The farm gets many visitors in  
 the summer and the most popular fruit 
 is the strawberry so more of this     
 fruit is grown. It is well equipped   
 with water sprays and electric fences.
 Each row of growing fruit has its own 
 water pipe and the fences are to deter
 rabbits and other animal invaders.    </content>
