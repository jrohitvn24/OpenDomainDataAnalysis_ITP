		<title>19The Pub,Ayot St.Lawrence</title>
		<content> One of the oldest buildings,16thC, is{
{THE OLD SCHOOL HOUSE.}It was used as a
 school until 1912.Now it is a private 
 residence,last owned by Nick Faldo,the
 golfer.                               
 The bars of {THE BROCKET ARMS }date   
 back to the 14thC. The bricks of the  
 fireplace are layed length ways then  
 width ways which was the method at    
 this time.There is a Tudor extension  
 which includes upstairs bedrooms.A    
 wall leans badly as the supporting    
 tree was removed when an extension was
 built recently.The beer barrels still 
 go down the original chute.The end of 
 the secret passage has been bricked   
 up.The pub is very popular,especially 
 the buffet lunches,and is responsible 
 for the congested lanes that anger the
 villagers!The pub is managed by Lord  
 Brocket's nephew who lives in what    
 used to be the post office,until 1977.</content>
