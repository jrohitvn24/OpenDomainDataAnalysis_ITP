		<title>06MISSON FEEDS AND STORAGE</title>
		<content> As you come into Misson there is a big
 building called Misson Feeds and      
 Storage but most people call it the   
 Crop Dryers. Misson feeds and Storage 
 have 25 employees. They took over in  
 1981 but the building has been        
 standing much longer. On average      
 Misson Feeds have 20 lorries coming in
 carrying grain each day from the local
 farms. Then some tests are done and   
 the grain is dried until it is needed 
 elsewhere. Two members of my family   
 work there, my dad and my sister.My   
 dad drives a fork lift truck and my   
 sister tests the grain for the        
 temperature and to see if there are   
 any creepy crawlies in it.            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
