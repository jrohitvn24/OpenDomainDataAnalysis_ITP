		<title>05AN AYLMERTON HOUSEWIFE</title>
		<content>  The housewife has lived in Aylmerton 
 for twelve years and originally came  
 from Aldborough.  She does not go out 
 to work and her children go by bus to 
 Gresham Primary School as the school  
 at Aylmerton has been closed down.    
  As the village is not adequately     
 served by public transport, she       
 travels by car to Cromer for her      
 shopping and also to visit the        
 dentist, and travels to Aldborough to 
 see her doctor.                       
  She does not use the village shop,   
 Public House, Post Office, garage,    
 church or village hall.  There are few
 opportunities in the village for      
 'get_togethers' with other housewives,
 more coffee mornings and similar      
 events would be welcomed.             
  Children are also faced with a lack  
 of facilities and organised events.
