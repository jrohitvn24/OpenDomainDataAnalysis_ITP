		<content>{A twelve year old  boy} **  {Friday}  
 I am awakened by my alarm at 7.00     
a.m.   I go down for breakfast, which  
is usually a bowl of cereal and a      
drink.I set off for the bus stop at    
8.05 a.m. The bus arrives some 20      
minutes later getting to school at 8.40
a.m. School starts at 8.45 a.m. and the
first thing we have is assembly at 9.00
a.m. Assemblies are given either by a  
particular class teacher or the        
Headmaster. After assembly we have     
maths until break. During this time we 
also have time for a spelling test in  
which we try to beat each other for top
marks. After break we have English     
activities, grammar, comprehension or  
reading. After dinner, which is usually
chips, we play football on the field   
until 1.15 p.m.The teams are picked by 
two captains, or just at random to try 
to make them as fair as possible...... </content>
