		<content> Salmonhutch is also the site of       
 Crediton Fly Fishing club.You have to 
 be 11 years old to join  and if you   
 want to keep any fish caught they must
 be 25cm long or more.On 2nd June 125  
 Brown Trout were used to stock the    
 Creedy and Yeo.The fish were all 2    
 years old and about 20cm long.        
   We then walked up to Uton hamlet.   
 There weren't any shops or anything,  
 just a phone box and a post box.There 
 were only eleven houses in Uton and 4 
 of them were thatched.We found a small
 entrance by the road side,it turned   
 out to be the site of an old well     
 (Ladywell).We think it used to be     
 someone's back garden-as there were   
 parts that had been looked after with 
 garden flowers growing.It was now very
 boggy and overgrown,the water seeping 
 out of the well had turned stagnant.  
 Leigh nearly fell in!                 </content>
