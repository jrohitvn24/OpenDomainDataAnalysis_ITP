		<title>07SHOPS IN LOWER WORTLEY LEEDS</title>
		<content> There is a parade of six shops near   
 our school on Lower Wortley Road.     
 These shops provide a service for the 
 surrounding area. The parade consists 
 of a butcher, wool shop, hairdresser, 
 confectioner, estate agent and green  
 grocer. We asked the shopkeepers about
 their daily routine. The butcher and  
 his wife own the butcher's and        
 hairdresser's and live over the       
 hairdressing salon. They have lived   
 there for 27 years and have seen the  
 area opposite the shop develop from   
 open fields and cottages to rows of   
 modern terraced houses. Their         
 customers all live locally and use the
 shops regularly. The butcher chooses  
 his own meat from the abattoir and it 
 is then delivered to the shop. He     
 makes his own sausages but buys ready 
 - made pies.
