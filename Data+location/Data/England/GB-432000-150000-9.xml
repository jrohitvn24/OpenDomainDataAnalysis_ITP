		<title>09THE SAMBOURN TRUST.HATHERDEN</title>
		<content> The following is inscribed on the     
 front of the school-house at Hatherden
 "This charity school for 24 poor      
 children of Hatherden and Wildhern was
 endowed by James Sambourn, merchant,  
 born in Andover, Obijt Oct, ye 20,    
 1725. DEI DONUN, DEO DATUM". The Latin
  translated "The gift of God, given   
 to God", doubtless sums up in a few   
 words James Sambourn's Christian      
 attitude toward wealth which God had  
 given him.In 1726 they purchased from 
 John Pollen for Â£30 a tenement with   
 orchard and this was "to be rebuilt or
 greatly repaired to be made fitting   
 for the purpose" of a school.The first
 schoolmaster,William Best of          
 Winterbourne Dantzoy was appointed in 
 1727 "To teach and instruct 24 poor   
 children to read, write and cast      
 accounts and learn the Church of      
 England catechism."                   </content>
