		<title>16MADELEY STAFFS : ATTITUDES</title>
		<content> In Madeley one's attitudes depend upon
one's origins &amp; address.The original   
Madeley folk resent being outnumbered  
by newcomers often townees.They feel   
the village has been urbanised,familiar
places have vanished under new housing 
&amp; the pace of life has increased.There 
is more vandalism.They no longer know  
everyone by name &amp; family history.Iron-
ically,though appreciate cultural      
advances &amp; like the greater mobility &amp; 
social occasions.The newcomers,mostly  
younger,work elsewhere &amp; are happy to  
come home to Madeley Â£in the country'. 
They want very much to belong but they 
also want to improve things.           
 Madeley Heath people feel too far from
the centre.It's a long walk or expens- 
ive bus ride to pension or doctor.Much 
of this is inevitable.Villages cannot  
stay unmoved by events.And villagers   
are basically friendly &amp; helpful folk. </content>
