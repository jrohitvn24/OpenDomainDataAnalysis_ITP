		<content>  Concord flies daily over the area, on
 its way from Heathrow to New York. It 
 attracts a variety of reactions,from  
 admiration to objections to its noise 
 and cost. The area has a strong       
 conservationist lobby. Some farms have
 gone over to organic agriculture, and 
 there is a Health Food shop in        
 Pangbourne.                           
  The river Thames provides a source of
 leisure activity in the area. Apart   
 from the tourists who pass through    
 many local people own small crafts.   
{ CONTRIBUTERS}Little Heath and        
 Denefield Schools, although in        
 Tilehurst, shared this D block. Many  
 of the pupils come from this area.    
 About thirty pupils from each school  
 were involved and a number of         
 teachers. Denefield pupils wrote pages
 2 to 9 and Little Heath, pages 1 and  
 10 to 20.                             </content>
