		<title>05The River</title>
		<content> The River Humber takes up a great part
 of our area.The river is very fast    
 flowing and dangerous.One of our      
 children was nearly swept away        
 recently while playing on the bank    
 side.At the side of the bank is a     
 measure which tells you when the river
 is going to flood.It measures from    
 three meters to twelve meters.        
  The river sometimes floods our area  
 and fills the cellars of the houses   
 and floods the land.Recently the      
 Yorkshire Water Authority have been   
 building a tidal wall to try and      
 prevent the floods.                   
  The River has lots of shifting sand  
 banks and often tugs have to go out to
 help boats which get stuck in the mud.
  In recent years there have been more 
 fishermen coming to Paull and they    
 have caused a pollution problem with  
 their lead weights and lines.         </content>
