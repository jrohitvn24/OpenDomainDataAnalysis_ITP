		<title>08MORE STREET GAMES - CALNE</title>
		<content> Round my street we play lots of games 
 the two games we play most are        
 football and Bulldog.Bulldog is a game
 played by any amount of players. First
 of all we play a game called "Spuds". 
 Everyone who is playing puts one hand 
 into the middle then you count around 
 the hands from one to ten whoever ten 
 lands on they are "on" it.The rest    
 line up against the wall then the     
 person who is "on" it shouts out a    
 name and that person has to run past  
 the catcher without being tagged. Then
 everyone else tries to run past the   
 catcher. If he is caught he joins the 
 catcher to tag the rest. They then    
 call out the next name and so it goes 
 on till everyone is caught.If the     
 catcher shouts "Bulldog" everybody has
 to run.When everyone is out you have  
 to start again.                       
                                       </content>
