		<title>07KINGSTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Just off the B2065 lies the village of
 Kingston. It is not on a major traffic
 route and the majority of houses are  
 built on both sides of a quiet road,  
 without pavements, rising gently away 
 from the valley towards Marley. A     
 second lane leads past the church,    
 several more houses and the post      
 office-cum-shop, which provides the   
 usual postal services, provisions and 
 newspapers. Although parts of the     
 church are Saxon, there are very few  
 old properties, only two are listed   
 buildings. Some houses are pre-1940   
 but most have been built in the past  
 30 years and are well maintained with 
 attractive gardens. The population has
 steadily increased and at present in  
 the immediate village, it numbers     
 approx. 340, of which 76 are children 
 and of the adults, 50 are retired.
