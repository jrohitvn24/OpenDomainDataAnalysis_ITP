		<content> All the group drove along the A11     
 Norwich - London trunk road on        
 15.7.85. Recently increased traffic   
 due to container lorries travelling to
 the East Coast ports, the North sea   
 gas and oil industries, tourism, bus  
 and coach services and a large local  
 car owning population has put great   
 pressure on this road. Ten thousand   
 vehicles a day were passing through   
 Attleborough and in May 1985, Mrs     
 Linda Chalker opened a 5 mile by-pass 
 to relieve the problem. Travelling    
 from Norwich the by-pass begins in our
 D block, near the Spooner Row turn and
 just at its beginning is the stone    
 pillar commemorating Â£200 given by Sir
 Edwin Rich for the first turnpike.    
 Sadly, soon after the opening, a fatal
 accident between a coach and a lorry  
 occured near here, attracting national
 media attention.                      </content>
