		<title>01The Lands beside the Brook</title>
		<content> Mainly agricultural land, growing     
 mainly wheat barley ad rape, plus a   
 few sheep and cattle kept on grass    
 areas.  In general not many people are
 engaged in agriculture, most of the   
 people living in this area ttravel to 
 work in the nearest towns.  People    
 rely on travelling out of the area for
 necessities as there are no           
 supermarkets, neither any clothing or 
 footwear shops.  The school children  
 over 11 years of of age travel to     
 other schools out of the area.  It is 
 necessary to travel to neighbouring   
 villages to attend a doctor.          
 Hospitals serving them are in towns,  
 also dentists.  the village hall      
 caters for Badminton, dances and      
 disco' and youth club and most village
 meetings, fetes, horticultural show.  
 the church and chapel are in full use.
