		<title>01THE BROWNHILLS AREA.</title>
		<content>   The Brownhills area falls into two  
 distinct regions. The western side, in
 the Walsall Metropolitan Borough, is  
 largely industrial and residential,   
 whilst the eastern area, in           
 Staffordshire, is predominantly rural.
   Principal settlements in the west   
 are{Brownhills}and{Walsall Wood}which 
 form a continuous urban development.  
{Clayhanger}is a small, isolated       
 village within this region.On the     
 eastern side the major settlement is  
 the village of{Stonnall}but there is  
 also some ribbon development as well  
 as separate farmsteads.               
   The focus of the road system is the 
 Shire Oak crossroads where the A452(T)
 (Chester Road) crosses the A461       
 (Lichfield Road). Lichfield is        
 approximately 9km from this point in  
 a N.E direction whilst Walsall is 6km 
 to the S.W.                           </content>
