 introduce himself to the children.He  
 also visits{farmers}who occasionally  
 have trouble with stray{dogs attacking
{their sheep,}or complain of lost stock
  Usually these have wandered into the 
 wrong field by mistake, but sometimes 
 they have been "rustled". Every year

 Many of these are caused by people,   
 often strangers travelling too fast on
 narrow roads slippery with mud. Most
