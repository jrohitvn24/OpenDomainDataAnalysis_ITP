		<title>07LIVING IN GULVAL</title>
		<content> People find Gulval a pleasant place to
 live and many take an active part in  
 village life. The surrounding         
 countryside is attractive and the town
 of Penzance and the sea are both      
 nearby. Even by Cornish standards the 
 climate is mild.                      
                                       
 Summer visitors bring increased       
 traffic. People must cross the busy   
 main road to reach the sea. The       
 beaches, safer than many in Penwith,  
 can be spoilt with litter. Any broken 
 glass is a hazard for paddling        
 children. Depending on winds and      
 tides, there is an occasional problem 
 with sewage from the Penzance outfall.
                                       
 Cutbacks in local bus services are a  
 current concern in the village, but in
 general people consider themselves    
 very fortunate to live here.          </content>
