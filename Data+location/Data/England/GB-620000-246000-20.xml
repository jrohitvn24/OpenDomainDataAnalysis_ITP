		<content> The London_Lowestoft railway line runs
 through the Fynn Valley but the only  
 station, at Bealings, is closed but   
 not demolished.  The unmanned level   
 crossing beside the station causes    
 concern locally as an accident        
 occurred recently.  In this part of   
 the country there is general concern  
 about this type of unmanned crossing  
 which causes fatalities.  Nearest     
 railway stations are at Woodbridge, or
 Ipswich on main London-Norwich line.  
 The bus service has been provided for 
 many years by a private company, up to
 five buses daily to or from Ipswich   
 for each village.The commuting        
 population travels by car and many    
 families have two cars, one for       
 enabling children to be taken to      
 school.  Minor roads are hedged and   
 narrow, causing concern about the risk
 from fast commuter traffic.           </content>
