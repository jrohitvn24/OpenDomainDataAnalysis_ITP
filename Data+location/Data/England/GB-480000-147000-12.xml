		<title>12A DAY IN THE LIFE OF ME</title>
		<content>    On a normal day at home I get up at
 about 7.45 and I go down stairs for   
 breakfast.For breakfast I usually have
 the breakfast cereal called start.It  
 takes me about 20 minutes to eat      
 it.When I have finished my breakfast  
 I go upstairs and I do my weight      
 training and press_ups. After that I  
 get washed and dressed.After 9.30 I am
 allowed to go out side because it is  
 not so early.I go out on my bike and I
 knock for James and David.We usually  
 go down to our camp in the trees every
 day.We play there all morning and have
 lots of fun.At about 12.30 I head back
 towards home so that I can start our  
 lunch.For lunch on a normal weekend I 
 usually have for dinner 5 sausages,   
 some baked beans and a fried egg. I go
 outside again and play all afternoon. 
 At 6.30 I have tea.At 8.45 I go to    
 bed. ]                                </content>
