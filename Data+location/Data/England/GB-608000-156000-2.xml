		<title>02 Chartham Hatch Village</title>
		<content>We entered Chartham Hatch along Bigbury
Road.Suddenly we came out of the       
woodland into a row of bungalows.It was
sudden because the first dwellings     
almost merge with the woods with many  
trees towering above them.Had it not   
been for the fact that we had just     
driven gingerly along the narrow       
wooded lane we might have been in any  
town or city as we looked at the first 
houses about us which were some square 
blocks of four terraced houses.There   
were the cars, the motorbikes, the     
telegraph poles and TV aerials of the  
towns and cities.But the gardens were  
all more alive and better tended than  
many town gardens. A jogger went by,   
certainly a symbol of the health       
conscious eighties.He was no doubt a   
university student, whose original     
home must have been in the Middle East.
