		<content>   {MRS NEEDHAM-WINSFORD.              
   Mrs Needham is an old age pensioner 
 living on the Grange Council Estate.  
 She moved to Winsford from Liverpool  
 almost twenty years ago. Mr Needham   
 travelled to Liverpool daily from     
 Winsford before he was able to get a  
 job in Winsford.They moved to Winsford
 from Liverpool because.               
{(a)}Jobs were easier to get.          
{(b)}All houses had inside toilets and 
     gardens.                          
{(c)}All new houses were smokeless     
     and had no chimneys.              
{(d)}The air was cleaner and there was 
     a country atmosphere.             
 Twenty years ago few people owned cars
 and much of the land was farmland. Now
 it has been built on and larger shops 
 and supermarkets have taken the place 
 of the small family shops.
