		<title>09COMMUNITY FUND RAISING</title>
		<content> Sherston has a habit of collecting    
 money for all kinds of charities.     
 Hardly a week passes without at least 
 one{fund raising event.}The recipients
 of the money range from local bodies  
 such as the Church,the Community      
 Centre,all the Youth Organisations,   
 Hospitals used by the village &amp; to    
 numerous National charities.       The
 methods of raising money can be small 
 events for example ,coffee mornings,  
 jumble sales &amp; sales of work; or by   
 larger events such as the yearly      
{Carnivals}and elaborate affairs       
 involving food &amp; drink.One young      
 member of the community made a        
 sponsored parachute jump which        
 benefited both the village and a      
 national cancer charity.No matter what
 the good cause is,Sherston people give
 generously.                           
                                       </content>
