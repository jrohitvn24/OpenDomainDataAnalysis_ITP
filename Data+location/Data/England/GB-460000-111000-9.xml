		<title>09NEWTOWN CHURCH SOCIAL EVENTS</title>
		<content> There is a fine community spirit.The  
 Holy Trinity Fellowship meets monthly,
 usually with a guest speaker on a     
 topical subject, or outing to a place 
 of interest. Social events are held to
 raise money for the church such as the
 annual Garden Fete in May which this  
 year raised Â£1,800, an occasional     
 concert, coffee morning or bazaar. The
 choir children have an annual camp and
 visits to Southampton Ice Rink.In 1985
 the adults went to a Promenade concert
 in the Royal Albert Hall, London. A   
 barbecue at Woodend and a Christmas   
 Carol Party have become very popular  
 annual events. A Harvest Supper is    
 held at Rookesbury Hall after Festal  
 Evensong in church. All produce       
 donated for the decoration of the     
 church is auctioned later and money   
 raised sent for famine relief.
