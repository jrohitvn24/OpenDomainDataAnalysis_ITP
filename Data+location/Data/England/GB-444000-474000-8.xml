		<title>08FARMER'S WIFE'S ROLE-SESSAY</title>
		<content>{Mechanisation}has greatly altered     
 the life of a farmer's wife since the 
 1930s.  Domestic appliances make light
 work of household tasks and cars make 
 it easy to purchase most foods ready- 
 prepared, instead of spending hours   
 baking.  Some{traditional tasks}such  
 as keeping geese and butter- and      
 cheese-making are now undergoing a    
 small revival, but a modern farmer's  
 wife is more likely to be engaged in  
 providing farm holidays. However, some
 wives directly support their husbands'
 endeavours - tractor-driving during   
 harvest and potato picking.           
 At{"Pick Your Own" farms,}wives spend 
 long hours in the farm shop.  Further,
 complex systems of farm finance, EEC  
 marketing and the need for up-to-date 
 accurate financial and productive data
 entails much paperwork often dealt    
 with by the farmer's wife.            </content>
