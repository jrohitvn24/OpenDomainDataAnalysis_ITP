		<content> I am writing about Sunday.I had slept 
 at my gran's house the night before.At
 10 o'clock I got up,dressed, and      
 packed my pyjamas in my bag.I washed, 
 brushed my teeth and went down for    
 breakfast.I had cornflakes,toast,and a
 cup of chocolate, then went home.My   
 mum was packing to go to the beach at 
 Polkerris.We got into our Cortina car 
 and drove off.When we arrived we payed
 50p to park.We walked to the beach.My 
 dad and I got undressed,pumped up our 
 boat,and went into the sea.The water  
 was very cold, so most of the time I  
 stayed in the boat.We left the sea,   
 played tennis,then had dinner which   
 consisted of sandwiches and crisps,   
 and later we had an ice cream.        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
