		<content>     {A DAY IN THE LIFE OF STEVEN (11)}
{  } When I wake up in the morning I   
 make my bed.My bed has got a quilt    
 with a B.M.X. cover on it.I get up and
 get dressed at 7 o'clock,and have a   
 wash and go down stairs and get my    
 breakfast .I have cornflakes or       
 wheatabix and a piece of toast with   
 butter on it.After that I help my mum 
 until it is time to go to school. I   
 kiss my mum and go to school with Mr  
 Stevens in the school taxi. I arrive  
 at school at 8.40 am.I go down to the 
 playground until 9.00 am. We go in    
 and do some work until 10.40 am then  
 we go outside to play. The whistle    
 goes and we come in at 11 o'clock and 
 do some work until 12 o'clock,then we 
 have our dinner.We have school dinners
 or sandwiches from home.The school    
 meals are nice because twice every    
 week I have chips and fish or sausages</content>
