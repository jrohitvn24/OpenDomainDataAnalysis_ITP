		<title>01NORTH EAST BLACKBURN</title>
		<content>This area covers the North East        
quadrant of Blackburn and the area of  
farming land between Blackburn and the 
neighbouring town of Rishton.          
The area is roughly divided equally    
between the urban spread of Blackburn  
and the rough grazing land to the East 
of Rishton.The farming land is used    
entirely for the grazing of cattle and 
 heep. The urban area of Blackburn     
 comprises an inner section of         
 "Grid-Iron" terraced housing almost   
 entirely occupied by the Asian        
 community, and an outer area of post  
 1918 and modern property largely      
 occupied by the "English" community.  
Although the entire area once supported
many textile firms these have          
disappeared, their modern replacements 
preferring sites on the new Industrial 
Estate at Whitebirk.
