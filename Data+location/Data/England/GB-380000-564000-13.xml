		<title>13CHESTERWOOD, HAYDON BRIDGE</title>
		<content> This is a small, nucleated village.   
 Usually, after enclosure, farmhouses  
 were built surrounded by their fields,
 not so at Chesterwood. Farmhouses     
 remain along its short, cobbled street
 Once it contained several{Bastles}    
 ,fortified for protection against     
 Border raids. Scots pines remain on   
 its fringes(These are indicators of an
 ancient forest).Mr.Pigg &amp; Mr.Wardle   
 are the principal farmers. Several    
 houses are occupied by retired        
 executives or commuters to Newcastle. 
 Some large barns have been converted  
 into houses. References in the deeds  
 of the oldest cottage go back to the  
 reign of Elizabeth I; possibly the    
 cottage is older still. The finest    
 house,{Chesterwood Grange,}stands 200 
 yards from the village.
