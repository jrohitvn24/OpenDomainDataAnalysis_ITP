		<title>09Boot Maker,Ravensthorpe.</title>
		<content>Mr.Horace Batten followed his great-   
grandfather,grandfather and father when
he went into the business of Top-boot  
manufacturer.The firm started in l75O  
in Gloucester,then a county where there
was much hunting,and they moved        
eventually to Ravensthorpe village.The 
business has widened its field and now 
makes boots for many of the top Show   
Jumpers and for the Cavalry both every-
day and ceremonial boots.In recent     
years there has been a growing demand  
for topboots for film and stage work.  
Handmade beechwood lasts are used and  
when these last makers die out and the 
special leather workers,such as the    
hand sewers,it is feared that this     
industry will die with them. Mr.Batten 
uses his skills in a converted out-    
building in the grounds of his house.  
He employs 5 people but unfortunately  
has no one to follow in his footsteps. </content>
