		<content> On Tuesday 2nd July we went to        
 Kensworth in relation to map 04 to    
 interview some residents one being Mr 
 Fox and his family.                   
   Although they live in Bury Farm Mr  
 Fox isn't a farmer therefore a local  
 farmer farms the land. Mr Fox and his 
 family have lived in this area for    
 three years and enjoy living here for 
 two reasons one they like the rural   
 area and two it is only three quarters
 of an hour from London where Mr Fox   
 works.                                
   Mr Fox chose to live in Kensworth   
 because he was brought up in the      
 countryside and does not which to     
 live it.
