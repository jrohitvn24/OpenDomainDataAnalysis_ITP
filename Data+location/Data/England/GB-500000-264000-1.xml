		<content> Melchbourne is a  small village       
 situated in the north western corner  
 of the county of Bedfordshire.        
 The surrounding countryside is gently 
 undulating arable and parkland, which 
 still retains many hedges and lovely  
 woods.                                
 The major part of the village is one, 
 no through road which ends in the     
 drive of Melchbourne Park.            
 The ages of the houses vary from      
 thatched cottages to some recently    
 constructed old peoples dwellings and 
 two bungalows in the process of being 
 built.                                
 The village hall and the church are   
 along this road, but the public house,
 the St. John Arms is half a mile to   
 the east.                             
 There are several farms and the Oakley
 Hunt Kennels close by..
