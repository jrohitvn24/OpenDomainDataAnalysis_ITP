		<content> The traffic problem that exists in    
 Bath is a common one for historic     
 towns whose roads and streets were    
 built long before the motor car was   
 dreamt of. This together with the lack
 of foresight of planners has added to 
 the situation. Following the SECOND   
 WORLD WAR a golden oportunity existed 
 to rebuild those areas destroyed by   
 German bombs. The ABERCROMBIE plan was
 put forwars but rejected. In the      
 1960's the BUCHANAN plan attempted to 
 deal with the traffic problem by      
 suggesting that a tunnel be dug to    
 carry passing traffic under the city. 
 Today much debate has surrounded the  
 BATHEASTON bypass which aims to divert
 all the south coast traffic away from 
 the city.This plan is due to start    
 before the end of the decade.         
 Meanwhile the traffic in Bath         
 continues to harm the envirnment.     </content>
