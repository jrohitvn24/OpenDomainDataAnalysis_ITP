		<title>14LOCAL INDUSTRY</title>
		<content>  Most industries are 'COTTAGE         
 INDUSTRIES'. There are a few large    
 industries such as {Spar }and the{    
{Co.op. }There are lots of pubs.       
  We visited a firm called {Collins    
{Fireplaces.}They make fireplaces from 
 stone, which they get from all round  
 the world e.g. Cotswolds,York,Forest  
 of Dean,West Muland,Portugal and      
 Germany. The firm is a family business
 as are most firms. The buildings in   
 which the firm is situated was an old 
 mill and there is still a passage     
 going under it. They make about three 
 fireplaces a week at roughly 200 per 
 fireplace.                            
  There are seven pubs and all there   
 breweries are{Manns.}Except for the{  
{Cromwell Cottage}and the{Turnpike}    
 which are 'Berni' steak houses. Most  
 of the old people shop locally.Trade  
 is small but thiving.                 </content>
