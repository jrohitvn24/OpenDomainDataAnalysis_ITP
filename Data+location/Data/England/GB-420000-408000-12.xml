		<title>12A day at first school(age 8)</title>
		<content> At 10 to nine I come to school. At    
 nine o'clock we start doing our first 
 subject and that's Maths. We usually  
 have a television programme in the    
 morning, which probably leads to      
 morning service. If it's sunny we go  
 out to play but if it's wet Mrs       
 Battye, our teacher, lets us stay in. 
 After playtime we will do English     
 work, after that it will be dinner    
 time. The people on first sitting have
 Mrs Brown and Mrs Senior look after   
 them but Mrs Gummerson looks after the
 other children. When the first sitting
 have come back it's our turn. After   
 we've had our dinner we have another  
 play time that lasts about five       
 minutes. Then we probably will do art 
 and craft then it will be time to have
 another play time. After that Mrs     
 Battye would tell us a nice story.
