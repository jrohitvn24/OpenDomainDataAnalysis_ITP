		<title>17THE BEAFORD CENTRE, BEAFORD</title>
		<content>   The Dartington Trust bought these   
 premises in 1966, and called it the   
 Beaford Centre.  Its purpose is to    
 bring to North Devon artistic events  
 not usually available to the people.  
 The Orchard Theatre was formed here,  
 now based in Barnstaple. The Centre   
 has a Photographic Archive containing 
 100,000 photos showing Devon old and  
 new.  The staff arrange various art   
 events out and around North Devon, is 
 involved in community projects, and   
 runs some evening classes for adults, 
 such as pottery, painting, upholstery 
 and drawing.  The Centre is available 
 for residential school parties, who   
 use the environment and Centre        
 facilities for educational purposes.  
 Ten full and part-time staff work in  
 the Centre, with another twelve       
 associated with it based elsewhere in 
 North Devon.                          </content>
