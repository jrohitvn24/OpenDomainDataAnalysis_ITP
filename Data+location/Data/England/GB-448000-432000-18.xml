		<content> The Willows is quiet.The only thing   
 which spoils it is the farmer who is  
 destroying the nature in the reserve. 
 He is cutting down trees,pulling up   
 the flowers and polluting the stream. 
 Certain flowers like the spotted      
 orchid and the bee orchid are very    
 rare.A long time ago there would have 
 been many orchids, now there are      
 hardly any left.If the trees,flowers  
 and grasses are all uprooted the wild 
 life will disappear,because the       
 surroundings are the creatures'       
 habitat.People dump rubbish and the   
 animals could be trapped or suffocated
 Some farmers are cutting the trees    
 down so they can take more land to    
 make more money.I think it is a good  
 idea to have The Willows because we   
 can learn a lot about nature by       
 visiting this conservation area.
