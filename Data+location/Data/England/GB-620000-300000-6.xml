		<title>06A Farmer's Life</title>
		<content> Mr Harrold has been a farmer all his  
 life. He was born in the house and    
 inherited the farm when his father    
 died. Living at Salamanca Farm in     
 Stoke Holy Cross he is now 45 years   
 old; during his life farming has      
 changed from a natural horse_powered  
 livelihood to a mechanised chemical   
 business. In a good year it is quite  
 lucrative but in a bad year it is not 
 quite so  good. It is being affected a
 good deal by nnational membership of  
 the European Economic Community. He   
 gets up at around 0530 hours, starts  
 milking his 50 cows at 0630hrs. and   
 finishes at 0830. He then milks again 
 from 1500 to 1730 hrs.He employs 2    
 people on his 168 acres: 1 for driving
 the tractor, and the other to help him
 with the cows and other 50 head of fat
 cattle.
