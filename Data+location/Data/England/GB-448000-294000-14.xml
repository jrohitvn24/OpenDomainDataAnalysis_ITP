		<content> The area is crossed by two main       
 traffic systems. There is the main    
 railway link between the cities of    
 Birmingham and Leicester and a        
 motorway.There                        
 was once a station at Croft but this  
 was burnt down some time              
 ago.There is a siding for a rail      
 link with the quarry  at              
 Croft.There is a disused railway      
 link between Stoney Stanton and       
 the main line that once served        
 the now disused quarries              
 there.There is the main motor way     
 link between Leicester and            
 Coventry the M69.The other major      
 roadway is the Fosse Way . This used  
 to take the bulk of the traffic       
 between Coventry and Leicester, but is
 now relatively quiet and is no longer 
 regarded as a trunkroad the A46. It   
 has been reclassified as a "B" road.  </content>
