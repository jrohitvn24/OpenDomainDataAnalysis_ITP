		<title>18FARMING AROUND LAMLASH.</title>
		<content>    A study made on the type of farming
 in Lamlash shows that the two main    
 arable crops are Barley and Grass.The 
 grass is used as silage for the       
 livestock.                            
    The livestock is made up of dairy  
 cattle.These provide the necessary    
 milk supply for Arran.When the cows   
 are milked,the milk is transported by 
 a milk tanker to be processed and     
 pasteurised in the neighbouring       
 village of Brodick.Once it has been   
 pasteurised it is put into 1 pint     
 plastic cartons to be distributed     
 around the island.                    
    There is one other crop that is    
 grown,which is potatoes but they are  
 sold commercially by the farmers,and  
 are used for a low cost food source by
 the farmer and his family.
