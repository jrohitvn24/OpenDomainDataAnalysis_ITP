		<title>07A FARMER'S WIFE'S DAY</title>
		<content> This morning we went to Marsh Farm and
 we went in two groups and my group was
 talking to the farmer's wife. She gets
 up at 7am and she cleans the kitchen. 
 Then she gets the breakfast for the   
 family and for the visitors. They have
 breakfast at nine o'clock. Afterwards 
 the farmers wife does a lot of baking 
 for the afternoon tea in the small    
 cafe. They have lunch time about one  
 o'clock. Then they prepare tables for 
 tea. At four o'clock they prepare the 
 food and serve teas. Afterwards she   
 does the tidying up and the washing   
 up. Then it is teatime for the family.
 They watch TV at eight thirty and the 
 farmer's wife sometimes feeds the     
 horses and ponies, the calves, hens   
 and cows and she has turkeys at       
 Christmas.
