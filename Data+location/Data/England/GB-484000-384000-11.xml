		<content> Members of the Kexby Parish Council   
 had a meeting in the Methodist        
 Schoolroom on June 14th.I attended the
 meeting with my father as members of  
 the public.                           
 A request from the village hall       
 committee to extend the period of the 
 village hall sports ground was        
 discussed and it was agreed to        
 negotiate a longer lease with the hall
 committee.                            
 The councillors then talked about the 
 local Development Plan.They mainly    
 talked about an open field on Church  
 Road.They were all in favour of       
 allowing this field to remain         
 undeveloped.The need to cut the       
 churchyard hedge was discussed and it 
 was agreed to investigate the matter  
 further.(the hedge they were          
 discussing runs along the public      
 footpath alongside the church)        </content>
