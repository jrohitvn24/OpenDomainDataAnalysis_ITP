		<content> On the last Sunday in June Cliffe     
 Village has its annual Fair and on the
 first Saturday in July Hemingbrough   
 holds its Annual Fete. The Fete is    
 the largest event in village life. It 
 has been held in each of the last six 
 years and has been blessed with fine  
 weather on each occasion. The 1985    
 Fete Queen is Diane Livsey who rode   
 around the village in procession      
 led by a Pipe Band followed by seven  
 decorated floats, people in fancy     
 dress and mums pushing decorated      
 prams. Everyone was represented in the
 Parade, from pre-school playgroup to  
 senior citizens.                      
 On the field were stalls, games,      
 competitions, displays and sports. The
 sports included athletics, cricket and
 rounders and involved teams from      
 schools at Goole, Howden,             
 Camblesforth and Hemingbrough.        </content>
