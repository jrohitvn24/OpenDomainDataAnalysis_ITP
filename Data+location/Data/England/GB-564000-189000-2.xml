		<title>02Little Burstead Church</title>
		<content>  The Church of St Mary the Virgin is  
600m south of Little Burstead. It is   
built on high ground to give a good    
view of the land. To the south east,   
St Nicholas Church Laindon is clearly  
visible.                               
  The church is made of flint rendered 
with cement. The butresses supporting  
the walls are self-made bricks of      
uneven size. The spire consists of     
Essex bargeboards. The porch faces     
south. The eastern side of the church  
has an extension added in 1787. The    
evidence for this is tombstones built  
into the walls.                        
  The graveyard is well maintained.    
Stones date from 1726 and include the  
grave of Captain Kidd, a pirate. Most  
graves face south, and those on the    
west side contain many of the past     
vicars.                                
                                       </content>
