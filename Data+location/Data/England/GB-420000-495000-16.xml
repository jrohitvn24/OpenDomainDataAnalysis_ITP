		<title>16WELFARE OF CATTERICK AREA</title>
		<content> All local planning has to be          
 authorised by Richmondshire District  
 Council who are very strict about any 
 changes made to the area. Their aim is
 to maintain the natural beauty of the 
 area. However, if local concern is    
 felt over some changes the council    
 plan, residents do not hesitate to    
 voice their opinions. Discord has     
 arisen between residents and both     
 district and county councils over such
 issues as new roadways, rights of way,
 bridle paths and proposed gypsy       
 encampments. Parish councillers do    
 their utmost to see that local        
 opinions are taken into account. Not  
 only on the landscape aspect but also 
 on the upkeep of the maintenance of   
 housing, schools and public buildings.
 This is an area of affluence and      
 social concern will keep that away.
