		<content>  After just one week of my short stay 
 at Grange Junior School, I have been  
 greatly impressed by what I have seen.
 The people are friendly and helpful.  
 The transport system is efficient,    
 though I have not yet plucked up the  
 courage to go upstairs on a double-   
 decker bus. The streets are narrow,   
 the cars are many, yet everyone       
 travels with ease. Drivers are        
 courteous to each other and to        
 pedestrians. Cyclists are allowed     
 plenty of room.                       
  The buildings are wonderful, the new 
 mixing in well with the old. The older
 areas have been preserved well.       
  The parks are quiet and beautiful.   
 Roses seem to thrive everywhere.      
  I imagine that I will always remember
 the sight and scent of the roses.
