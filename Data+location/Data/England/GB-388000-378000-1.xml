		<title>01ADLINGTON AND MOTTRAM</title>
		<content>   Our survey area is comprised of land
 west of the Pennine foothills. Most of
 the area is grazing land for dairy    
 cattle and horses.Two rivers, the     
 Bollin and the Dean, flow from the    
 hills to the east, through the area,  
 towards the coast.                    
   To the north lie Poynton and        
 Stockport, to the west Wilmslow and   
 Alderley Edge, to the south           
 Macclesfield and to the south-east    
 Bollington.                           
   The two villages of Adlington and   
 Mottram are similar in both having no 
 real centre and having many large     
 detached residential properties.In    
 both communities people travel to the 
 surrounding towns and even further    
 afield for employment.Though there is 
 a flow of people moving in and out of 
 the area the total population remains 
 constant and there is little building.</content>
