		<title>09SHIPBUILDING IN GOOLE</title>
		<content>                                       
{ Ship building}and ship repairs began 
 shortly after the port of Goole was   
 founded in 1826.The shipyard was      
 originally owned by the Craggs family 
 and was latterly part of British      
 Shipbuilders.                         
  It was a real blow to this area      
 which has a high unemployment level,  
 when in March 1984, Goole Shipyard was
{closed}with the loss of over 300 jobs.
  In September 1984, the yard was      
 bought by Cochrane Shipbuilders of    
 Selby. Later, in February 1985, it was
 announced that ships were once again  
 to be built in Goole.                 
  This was followed by further{orders  
 and it was hoped that the present     
 workforce of over 50 would soon be    
 increased.
