		<content>    When Stevenage was first built it  
had to employ lots of people who were  
moving to the new town. They built     
an industrial area (on the W.  of the  
town) away from the houses so the      
houses weren't in a dirty area.The     
main jobs were in: Engineering         
(Aircraft &amp; electrical) plastics,      
printing and publishing, photographic  
and Government research.               
    More recently a smaller industrial 
area has been added on the N.E. side of
the town. Although a number of         
firms have been attracted, as with     
the rest of the country, unemployment  
has been a problem, and is the highest 
in Hertfordshire.                      
    One of the trends not predicted    
when the town was built was the large  
number of commuters travelling to work 
in London.                             
                                       </content>
