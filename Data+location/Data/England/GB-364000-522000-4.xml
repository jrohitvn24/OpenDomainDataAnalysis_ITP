		<content> Miss. Gunnell is the church organist  
 and choir mistress.                   
    She has been keeping bees for twen-
 ty four years.She has four hives,from 
 September to April the bees are shut  
 in and she gives them forty lbs of    
 food.She opens the hives.She smokes   
 the hives to make the bees drowsy and 
 before they sleep they swallow as much
 honey as they can because they think  
 the hive is on fire.She removes the   
 rest of the honey combs cooks them and
 puts the honey into jars.She gets     
 twenty lbs of honey from one hive.    
    From April to September the bees   
 fly free collecting pollen.Sometimes  
 she has them taken onto the fells to  
 produce heather honey.                
    Bees are fascinating insects having
 special dances to give each other     
 messages.They only sting when annoyed.
 All bee keepers get stung.            </content>
