		<title>18GARDEN TRAILS IN CHALFORD</title>
		<content>                                       
 Every summer there is a Garden Trail  
 in Chalford.People who do not mind    
 other people looking in their garden  
 have a sign on their gate saying      
 "Open Garden".Everyone pays one pound 
 and is given a leaflet showing all the
 gardens that are open to the public.  
 You can then walk round the village   
 looking at the gardens.We enjoy       
 looking at all the flowers in         
 everyone's gardens.If it is sunny     
 there are ice-creams for sale.As      
 Chalford is built on a steep slope you
 get wonderful views from all the      
 cottage gardens.You can look over the 
 rooftops at the houses and gardens    
 below in the valley.The money raised  
 is for the Chalford Village Hall      
 project,as we are trying to build a   
 hall for the people of the village to 
 use for recreation.                   </content>
