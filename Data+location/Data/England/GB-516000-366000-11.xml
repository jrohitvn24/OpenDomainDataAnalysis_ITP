		<title>11BUCKNALL SCHOOL - EQUIPMENT</title>
		<content> The{computer}is the most advanced and 
 most up to date, not to mention the   
 most expensive, item in the school. It
 has a tape recorder but that has been 
 replaced by the quicker and quieter   
 disk drive. The monitor is very heavy 
 and it shows up all the things you    
 write or program the computer to do.  
 It came with the computer which came  
 about two years ago.  The printer     
 did come on its own and was quite     
 expensive  but it saves the secretary 
 and the two teachers time that would  
 otherwise be wasted on typing and     
 duplicating all day long. {Art}is very
 enjoyable where people get the choice 
 of what to do ranging from            
{basketmaking, macrame, scratchboard   
{linowork, leatherwork, needlework,    
{Fischer technik}(which is a           
 construction kit),{pastel drawing     
 and{painting}to name but a few.       </content>
