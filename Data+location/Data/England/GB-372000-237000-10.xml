		<content> In the Eastnor Area there are{eight   
{arable farms.}They all grow corn and  
 mowing grass and some grow potatoes.  
 They grow the following varieties of  
 corn :- oats, wheat and barley. They  
 also grow the following varieties of  
 potatoes :- wilja, pentland hawk and  
 desiree.  The farms cut their own     
 grass and corn,some of this is fed to 
 cows and sheep and some is sold.  Two 
 of the eight farms are rented the rest
 are still farmed by the Estate. Some  
 of the farms have new machinery but   
 most of it is a few years old. The new
 machinery consists mostly of combines 
 or corn hauling trailers, new tractors
 and ploughs.
