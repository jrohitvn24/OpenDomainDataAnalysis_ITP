		<content>The people we questioned believed the  
area was average in the amount of crime
it experienced.They believed this crime
to be the result of unemployment,      
boredom and a lack of discipline.Some  
people believed there was a lack of    
police supervision and one person      
believed crime to be the result of the 
Governments lack of concern for the    
people and their giving the police too 
much power so that rebellion has       
resulted particularly amongst the      
young,this in itself leading to a break
down in law and order.All of the people
questioned believed punishments should 
be stricter because some criminals were
not afraid to commit the same crime    
again.One person said there were too   
many suspended sentences and everyone  
agreed that haging should be brought   
back for murder,rape and chld abuse.
