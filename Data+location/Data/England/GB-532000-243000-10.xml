		<content> Most children go to playgroup when    
 they are 3 years old. At 4 they go to 
 primary school, at 11 to the Village  
 College. At 16 they go to work or to a
 sixth form college in Cambridge.      
  In July all children meet their new  
 teachers for September. The College   
 takes children from different primary 
 schools so this is their first meeting
 except on area sports days. They may  
 meet again at holiday summer school.  
  The Village College in South End is a
 community centre as well as a school  
 for 600 pupils. It has a playgroup,   
 youth and adult clubs, evening classes
 and even its own farm. It was opened  
 by the Rt. Hon. R.A.Butler in 1954.   
  The primary school has two buildings:
 infants (built 1877) in High Street;  
 juniors (built 1963) in Brook Road.   
 It has about 150 infants, 200 juniors.
  Another playgroup is at the Barracks.</content>
