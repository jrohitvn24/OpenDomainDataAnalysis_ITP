		<title>06Food of Today</title>
		<content>   Although the underlying trend of    
 today is for more{wholesome food      
 ie.less animal fats,sugar and salt and
 a return to wholemeal flours, the     
 farmer and his family stick to their  
{traditional foods.                    
  {Breakfast}is bacon,eggs,cereal.toast
 and jam with a cup of tea or coffee.  
{  Dinner}is always meat,two           
 vegatables,potatoes and a pudding.    
{  Teatime}is often a sandwich and a   
 piece of cake,followed by a large     
 supper later in the evening.          
   Of the food on the farmers table,   
 jam, cakes, and sometimes, the bread, 
 are all  home made, whilst the        
 vegetables,potatoes and eggs are home 
 produced.                             
   Meat is usually bought in bulk,     
 ready jointed for the freezer.
