		<title>16History of Nevill Holt</title>
		<content> Holt was created from cleared woodland
 in the 12 or 13 Centuries. Sir Thomas 
 Nevill purchased the property and     
 extensions to the Great Hall were     
 built in the 14th. Century. The Great 
 Hall remains the least altered since  
 its construction. The Nevill Family,  
 after 400 years of occupancy, sold    
 Nevill Holt in 1868 to help pay their 
 debts. Edward Cunard bought the       
 property for Â£105,000.Through the     
 Cunard's interest in the Fernie Hunt  
 Medbourne prospered greatly. In 1920  
 it ceased being a private residence   
 and was opened as a Preparatory       
 School which it has remained ever     
 since. Mr.F.Seville Phillips became   
 headmaster in 1928 to be succeeded by 
 his son, Mr.David Phillips, who is the
 present owner and headmaster of Nevill
 Holt. It is both a boarding and day   
 school for boys and girls.            </content>
