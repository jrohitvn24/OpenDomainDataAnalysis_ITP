		<content>      The present{Michelmersh Post     
{Office}has been open since l984.  It  
 is situated in the Brickworks itself. 
 It was opened so that the old people  
 in Michelmersh didn't have to go in to
 Romsey to post their letters.  It is  
 also a general store and sells things 
 such as tea, coffee, sweets and       
 cereals.  The workmen from the        
 Brickworks buy their lunch at the     
 general store so that they don't have 
 to bring a packed lunch.              
      There are four employees at the {
{Post Office.}It is only small and     
 doesn't receive many letters because  
 there is a post box down the road.    
 They receive about three parcels and  
 fifty letters a day but they do not   
 sort them as Southampton branch deals 
 with this.  The Brickworks' office is 
 next to the{Post Office}and from there
 you can see most of the Brickworks.   </content>
