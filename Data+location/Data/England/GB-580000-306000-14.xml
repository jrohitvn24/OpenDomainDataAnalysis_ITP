		<content>                                       
  The church of S.S. Peter &amp; Paul is of
 considerable historical interest,     
 particularly in relation to its       
 associations with the legend of the   
 Pedlar of Swaffham.                   
  The maintainance of the fabric of the
 church places a heavy burden on the   
 congregation but the current appeal   
 for Â£20,000 for the restoration of the
 vestry is being met.                  
  The groups within the church cater   
 for 3-16 year olds through Sunday     
 School and Pathfinder groups, whilst  
 the needs of the many older members   
 are met through coffee mornings,      
 prayer groups and lay visits.         
  The Parish Church Rooms, formerly the
 National School, provides a venue for 
 these groups.
