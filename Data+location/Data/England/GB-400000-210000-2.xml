		<content>There are many farms,some of which date
back more than 200 years.There are a   
number of large private houses &amp; some  
smaller cottages(about haf a dozen).The
A435 focuses most of the settlement in 
this area &amp; it runs through the valley 
of the River Churn in the western part 
of the section.Otherwise the settlement
is fairly scattered.                   
  The landscape is made up of mostly   
fields,some for grazing and some for   
crops.The landscape is not all at one  
height-the land is fairly hilly with   
many trees.
