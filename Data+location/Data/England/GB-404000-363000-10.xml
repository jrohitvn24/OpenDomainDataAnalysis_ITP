     My mum gets up at about half past 
seven.  When me and my sister have gone
to school my mum goes to work at about 
quarter past nine.  She works at a     
Guest House in Hartington where she    
does the cleaning and makes all the    
beds and also serves in the tearoom.   
                                       
     She comes home between half past  
four and half past five.  When she gets
home she cooks tea for us.  Then we    
help Mum with the washing up.          
                                       
     Mum then makes the beds (by this  
time she is sick of making beds!)      
before sitting down and putting her    
feet up to watch the television.       
                                       
     My mum goes to bed round about    
one o'clock.                           
                                       </content>
