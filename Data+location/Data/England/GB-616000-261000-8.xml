		<content>  There is an unusually varied range of
building styles in the village,dating  
from around 1400.The oldest is the     
fortress-style tower of St.Mary's      
Church,built in the tenth century.On   
Cross Green is a jettied,timber-framed 
building with an aisled frame.A mile   
south-east of the village is Crow's    
Hall,a seventeenth century brick-built 
moated mansion.                        
  Most of the older buildings are in   
the village centre where there has been
much alteration,extension and infill,  
influenced by Georgian,Victorian and   
Modern styles.Some of the buildings are
considerably different behind their    
facades.Many have had brick or rendered
fronts or shop fronts added.           
  There is growing interest in the con-
servation and restoration of Debenham's
architectural heritage.Illustrated     
lectures are given on this subject.    </content>
