 to enjoy yourself in our area. There  
 are plenty of playing fields and a few
 parks. There is also a Sports Centre. 
 The fields are small areas for playing
 things like football or just playing  
 with your friends. Some fields have   
 separate sections for people on their 
 bikes.                                
 The parks have only small adventure   
 places. There are swings, slides and  
 roundabouts for young children. There 
 is one enormous park called{Sandall
