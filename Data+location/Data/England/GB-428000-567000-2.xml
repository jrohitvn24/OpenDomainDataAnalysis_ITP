		<title>02GAMES SURVEY Battle Hill 1st</title>
		<content>We did a survey of all the games the   
children of Battle Hill Estate were    
interested in.During playtime and      
lunchtime the boys enjoyed playing     
football most of all,but in summer they
liked practising for Sports Day by     
having races.Girls like playing chasey 
hide and seek,hopscotch and skips.The  
craze after school for the boys was    
playing on their B.M.X.bikes,doing     
tricks such as wheelies,jumps,wheel    
spins.The boys all were very saftey    
conscious and wore Knee pads and       
helmets.Breakdancing,i.e.,body-popping 
is also popular an energetic way of    
dancing.The girls of Battle Hill enjoy 
riding their bike,playing houses,tennis
and rounders,singing and dancing their 
favourite pop songs.Many children are  
members of clubs and organisations,such
as the Brownies,Cubs and Judo Club.
