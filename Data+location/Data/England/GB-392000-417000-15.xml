		<content>           {1. Chinese Skipping        
{  2. Queenio Coco 3. Hide and Seek.   
 To do Chinese Skipping you need about 
 3 metres of elastic and three or more 
 people.You tie the elastic in a knot  
 at one end so it is a whole thing.Two 
 people stand in at each end and the   
 other one jumps from side to side over
 the elastic and in between. You can   
 make up your own jumps and songs to go
 with them.                            
      "Queenio Coco" is a ball game.All
 you need is a tennis ball and four or 
 more people.One person is queenio coco
 and she turns away and throws the ball
 behind her.The other people run to    
 catch the ball and when one of them   
 gets the ball they stand together in a
 group and sing."Queenio coco who's got
 the ball?" "I haven't got it it isn't 
 in my pocket.Queenio coco who's got   
 the ball?"                            </content>
