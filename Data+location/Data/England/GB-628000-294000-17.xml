		<content> About 30% of the people here belong to
 families who have lived in the area   
 for 2 or more generations.Perhaps     
 because of this,social divisions are  
 not strongly marked.There are farmers,
 several professionals,some retired,   
 several self-employed &amp; little real   
 poverty. In 1981 there were 491       
 people;238 male &amp; 253 female.Of these 
 8% were under 5, 17% were 5-16,58%    
 were between 16 &amp; 64,11% were 65-75 &amp; 
 4% were 75 or more; the oldest resid- 
 ent is 94.These numbers compare with a
 total population of 477 in 1881,with  
 37% being under 16,of which 1/3 were  
 under 5.A recent fall in the numbers  
 of children is causing local concern  
 because Norfolk C.C. is reviewing its 
 policy of school closure; looking at  
 schools with numbers below 100.People 
 feel strongly that their village sch- 
 ool is a vital part of the community. </content>
