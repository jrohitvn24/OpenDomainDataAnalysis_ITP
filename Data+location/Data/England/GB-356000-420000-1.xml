		<content>   The gently undulating{landscape}was 
 formed from glacial deposits and      
 subsequent erosion. Underlying{rocks} 
 outcrop as sandstone in a glacially   
 deposited ridge at Whittle-le-Woods   
 quarries in the East of the           
 block. The{soils}consist of a mixture 
 of clay, sands and gravels being      
 suited to intensive grassland farming 
 of dairy cattle.                      
   The area is now part of the{Central 
{Lancashire New Town}and new housing   
 for sale and for rent is being built  
 in much of the area to the West of the
 M61 motorway.                         
   The area is crossed in a north-south
 direction by the A6, M61 and the Leeds
 Liverpool canal which rises through a 
 flight of seven locks at Johnson's    
 Hillock.
