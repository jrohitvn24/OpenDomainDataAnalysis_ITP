		<content>    The Community Association  was     
 formed in 1976 with the aim of        
 providing a Community Centre for the  
 village, and the first organised event
 was a Silver Jubilee parade and fete  
 in 1977. A year later the first       
 carnival since 1959 was organised and 
 the following year this was extended  
 to a full week of events including a  
 Country Fair,Sports Day,barbecue,pram 
 race,disco etc. In 1981 a Horse Show  
 was introduced.                       
    The Association is also responsible
 for the annual firework display,barn  
 dances,film shows, Halloween parties  
 and many other events which improve   
 the entertainment amenities in the    
 village.                              
    The Association ,besides its main  
 aim has also, over the years, striven 
 to maintain a close village spirit in 
 the face of ever increasing expansion.</content>
