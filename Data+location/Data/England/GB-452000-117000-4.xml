		<content>   Bishops Waltham offers a wide range 
 of facilities for{tourists.}The main  
 attraction is the{Palace Ruins.}It is 
 at the Palace that an annual fete'    
 happens on June 1st. Most local       
 societies run stalls at it to make    
 funds. It is usually a great success. 
   There is a small craft centre       
 called The{Granary}opposite the Garden
 Centre where local{craftsmen}sell and 
 exhibit their work. It is attached to 
 a Restaurant bearing the same name.   
 Nearby is an{Art Gallery}which will   
 open soon.                            
   In the area there many{Public Houses
 but the{Priory Inn}is the only one to 
 provide accomodation. It has three    
 single rooms which adjoin. Also it has
 a double room. It is Â£10.00 per person
 per night. It is also nice for a meal.
