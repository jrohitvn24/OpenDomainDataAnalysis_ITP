 belong to the Hexton Manor Estate and 
 the rest are privately owned. Heidi   
 lives in a house incorporating a      
 cottage which is 400 years old. An    
 extension is being added carefully to 
 enhance the old building. Hexton is a 
{conservation area}so the buildings    
 must be carefully preserved. One of   
 the oldest residents was born in a    
 village cottage. When she married she 
 moved to the cottage next door where  
 she lives still.{Hexton Manor}is a    
 large country house with 10 bedrooms.

 presents.
