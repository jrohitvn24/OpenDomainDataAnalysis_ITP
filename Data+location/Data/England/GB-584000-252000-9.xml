		<title>09Farming in Lawshall District</title>
		<content>Of our area, 83% is farmland,the major-
ity of which is arable-growing wheat,  
barley,oil seed rape, field beans,oats,
hay and grass for silage. There is also
a small pig farm,another 2 with small  
friesian dairy herds and another 2 with
suffolk sheep. The farms tend to be    
small and are therefore lacking in much
expensive equipment, so there is an    
amount of sharing or hiring from each  
other. With the recent changes in the  
stubble burning laws, after last year's
harvest, there was hardly a field burnt
off, which pleased conservationists    
among us. In recent years, many hedge- 
rows have been ripped out to make      
larger fields and use of every scrap of
land. One effect of this is during bad 
winters, such as the last one, we get  
very large snow drifts causing the     
roads to be blocked.Also many Public   
Footpaths and Bridleways have been lost</content>
