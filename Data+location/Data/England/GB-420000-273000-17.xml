		<title>17OUR HOBBIES</title>
		<content> Two boys made a list about the juniors
 hobbies. They did it by asking all the
 juniors what their favourite hobbie   
 was. The most popular hobby happened  
 to be swimming. That was propably     
 because we go swimming every week at  
 Solihull swimming baths. The second   
 favourite hobby was reading. They     
 thought that the most popular one was 
 going to be collecting cars. Most of  
 the top class said collecting cars but
 in the first and second juniors they  
 said swimming and that is how it      
 became the most popular.
