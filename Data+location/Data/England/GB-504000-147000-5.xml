		<content>   The bridge across Upper Street was  
 built in 1914. The villagers crossed  
 over from the Manor to get their      
 vegetables. Today the bridge is unsafe
 for anyone to walk across it.         
   Just down the road is The Well. It  
 was built in 1886 with two corner     
 seats. There is a chain hanging which 
 used to have a cup on it. We talked to
 an old man who is 88years old and he  
 said he used to use the cup when he   
 came to school. Today the well is dry 
 but local people are carrying out     
 renovation works and it is hoped that 
 in the near future water will be      
 available from the well.              
   Just over the road in Gomshall Lane 
 look out for an extra wide door,it is 
 as wide as four children. The door was
 used by the Village Stores for bulk   
 stores like grain,it was carried from 
 Gomshall Station,exactly one mile away</content>
