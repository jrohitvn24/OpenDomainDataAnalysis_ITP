		<title>16Entertainment in North Bucks</title>
		<content> Although there are many clubs and     
activities in the village of Great     
Horwood,for other forms of             
entertainment a journey outside the    
village is required.                   
 There are cinemas at Buckingham,      
Bletchley and Aylesbury. Live Theatre  
can be found at Milton Keynes and      
Oxford, although there are number of   
local amateur dramatic societies.      
 Circuses and funfairs visit local     
towns and villages and in August there 
is a fair on the village green in      
Great Horwood itself.This fair is      
really the village feast and has been  
established over the centuries.        
 The lack of public transport means    
that a car is almost a necessity of    
life if villagers are to take advantage
of the entertainment available.
