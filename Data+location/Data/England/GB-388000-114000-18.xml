		<title>18SPORTS IN STUBHAMPTON AREA</title>
		<content> As the area is sparsely populated,    
 there is not a great deal of          
 recreation.Because of the unspoilt    
 country side and excellent views,     
 walking is an obvious pastime.The     
 numerous footpaths and bridlepaths    
 crossing the woods and fields provide 
 ample scope for walking,for pleasure  
 and for ecology studies,particularly  
 the Nature Trust areas such as        
 Fontmell Down;Washers Pit and         
 Stubhampton Bottom are also well      
 walked areas.A certain amount of      
 shooting takes place for rabbits,     
 pigeons,pheasants and partridges.     
 Pheasants and partridges are specially
 reared by one or two of the landowers 
 to provide sport for shooting parties.
 Fox hunting is another sport which is 
 popular in this area.Horse riding is  
 popular for privately owned horses    
 and nearby breeding stables.          </content>
