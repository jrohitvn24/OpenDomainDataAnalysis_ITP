		<title>14The Warmington Valley #2</title>
		<content>  Much of the valley is given over to  
 pasture for sheep and cattle.There    
 are some crops of rape seed and       
 cereals with occassionally maize.     
 Until recent years the valley has been
 very boggy with poor drainage and     
 flooding at the first signs of rain.  
 The small stream which meanders       
 through it,is bordered by Willow      
 trees. This has been the source of    
 much joy to small boys trying out     
 fishing for the first time and        
 spending a many happy hour            
 catching the sticklebacks and minnows.
 The farmers have recently been very   
 active improving the land by          
 investment in land drains to overcome 
 the flooding and reclaim more ground  
 for crops.The area is prosperous for  
 farmers,this being acredited to the   
 balance of high(dry) and low(wet) land
 always allowing crops and pasture.    </content>
