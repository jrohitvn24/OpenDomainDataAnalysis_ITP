		<title>10BUSHEY"FRIDAY INVADERS"CLUB</title>
		<content>   This club is for 8 to 13 year olds. 
 It was started by{P.C. Moxley}a local 
 policeman who thought children had    
 nothing to do at night.               
   There are many activities such as   
{discos, sports, outings, darts, pool, 
{and table-tennis.                     
                                       
  At the moment,the number of people   
 going to the club is{about 200.       
 The club needs more equipment but     
 it does not have enough money.        
 The parents help to raise money by    
 holding{jumble-sales.}Everything that 
 happens goes down in the{log book}how 
 much money they have,what they do,    
 who attends,and people who misbehave. 
  Even though some people would like   
 even more things to do, most agree    
 that it is                            
           {GREAT}!
