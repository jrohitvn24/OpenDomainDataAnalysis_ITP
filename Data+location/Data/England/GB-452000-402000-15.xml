 I got up at 9 o clock and went into   
 the bathroom and washed.I came back   
 into my room dressed,then I went down 
 -stairs for breakfast.I had cornflakes
 and a drink of tea. I went to the     
 hairdresser's. My mum paid,it cost    
 65p.                                  
  When I got in I watched the T.V.     
 At 12 o'clock I had my dinner.I had   
 chicken fingers and chips.After that I
 went out.I hadn't been out five       
 minutes when it started raining.I put 
 T.V. on and watched some cartoons.    
  At 4.30 we had tea.We had spaghetti. 
  At 5.45 we went swimming.I changed   
 and jumped in.I swam about for a      
 bit,and the girls went out.My dad and 
 I got out, dried, and went            
 home.I put my things in the wash and  
 went to bed. It was 9.30p.m.
