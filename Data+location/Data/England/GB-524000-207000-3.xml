 Fresian milking cows. They are milked 
 at 5.30am and 3pm and each cow        
 produces four to five gallons of milk 
 each day. It is stored in a cooled    
 tank overnight. Collected daily by the
 milk_marketing board the milk is used 
 for yogurt, butter and cream as well  
 as being delivered to the door after  
 treatment.
