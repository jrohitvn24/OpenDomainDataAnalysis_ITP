		<title>05Highgate Common</title>
		<content>On the common there are many           
interesting things. When we went we saw
lots of wild flowers, bluebells,       
foxgloves, purple and white heather.   
There are brambles where the           
blackberries will grow. We saw a large 
toad. We saw butterflies and moths,    
birds and ladybirds. We saw a vole's   
hole and a fox's hole. There are lots  
of trees, mostly silver birch and oak. 
The common has picnic tables and       
sometimes there is an icecream man. He 
is usually there on Sundays.           
Some people collect collect leaves for 
their hobby. Other people take         
photographs. Some people climb trees.  
It is a nice big area. You can run     
about and play tick or have a picnic on
the grass. There are car parks and     
public toilets. Some people take their 
dogs to the common because there is    
plenty of space for them to run about. </content>
