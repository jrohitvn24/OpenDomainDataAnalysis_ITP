		<title>01Kielder Village &amp; environs</title>
		<content> At the north end of Kielder Water, and
 at the heart of the Kielder Forest is 
 the village from which both take their
 name. The forest surrounds the        
 village,with only the valley of the   
 Deadwater Burn to the north, and the  
 reservoir to the south, breaking the  
 blanket of trees.                     
 The Forestry Commission is the major  
 employer in the area, and the village 
 was extended in the early 1950s to    
 cope for the influx of forestry       
 workers. The Commission has workshops 
 and laboratories in the village, as   
 well as a Visitors' Centre.           
 Picnic sites and view points have been
 established to encourage tourist to   
 visit and enjoy the area.
