		<title>15A TYPICAL SUNDAY</title>

  I get up at 9.30 watch videos and    
 television until 12.o'clock. Whilst   
 I'm watching it I have cereals and    
 toast then go outside and ride on my  
 bike until dinner. My{Sunday dinner   
 could well be chicken, roast potatoes,
 sprouts, and gravy. After dinner I    
 often call for a friend and take the  
 dogs for a walk over the fields. When 
 I return I spend the rest of the      
 afternoon playing on my roller-skates 
 in the road until tea is ready at     
 about six o'clock  . After tea I have 
 a bath , watch television and         
 sometimes read in bed before going to 
 sleep at about nine o'clock.
