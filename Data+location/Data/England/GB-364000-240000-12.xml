		<title>12RAILWAY - ASHPERTON</title>
		<content> The main line from Hereford to        
 Worcester crosses the A417 south of   
 the village. When the railway was     
 first built in 1861 there was a       
 station at Ashperton which was of     
 great importance to the area. It had  
 up and down line platforms with a     
 footbridge across; and was used for   
 the movement of livestock, timber,    
 fertilizers and coal. Special trains  
 were laid on to bring hop-pickers from
 the Midlands, South Wales and Bristol 
 for the hop-picking season every      
 September. Ashperton Station and its  
 buildings was demolished in 1966 when 
 the railway system was reduced but    
 working continued on the two lines    
 until 1984 when one line was closed.  
 The unused track is being removed from
 the Ashperton section of the line at  
 this moment. Maintenance work is      
 carried out at night or on Sundays.   </content>
