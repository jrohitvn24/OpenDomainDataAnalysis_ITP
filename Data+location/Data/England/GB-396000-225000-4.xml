		<content> The new Woodmancote Village Hall was  
 opened in June 1968 to take over from 
 the old hall which had become too     
 small for the various activities done 
 there.                                
   It is used by Cubs,Brownies,a karate
 club and a dancing class which use it 
 on Monday, Tuesday and Friday         
 evenings. Also, every morning in term 
 time there is a playgroup.            
   Behind the Village Hall there is a  
 large recreation ground which is used 
 by the local Football and Cricket     
 Clubs and doubles as a playground for 
 local children.                       
   Besides having its own car-park, the
 hall was extended by the Woodmancote  
 Society in 1979 to give room for a new
 kitchen and a lavatory.
