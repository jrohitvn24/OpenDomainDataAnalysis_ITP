		<title>06Street Market in Cockermouth</title>
		<content> There has been a Monday Market for 700
 years. Cockermouth received a Market  
 Charter in the reign of Henry III     
 about 1222 A.D.                       
 About 1679 a regulation was introduced
 to make the buying and selling of     
 goods fair to all. A scavenger had the
 duty to signal the opening of the     
 market by ringing the bell at eleven  
 o'clock. Then goods, especially butter
 could be sold. The bell hung in a     
 niche, on the wall of the former      
 Greyhound Inn and is there to-day on  
 the south side of Market Place.       
 One of our senior citizens retains the
 tradition and rings the Market Bell at
 10 a.m. Business begins for the 15    
 stall-holders which includes goods    
 such as fish, fruit and veg., cheese, 
 clothes, hard-ware and a very popular 
 plants and shrubs stall where you can 
 buy "Old World" roses .               </content>
