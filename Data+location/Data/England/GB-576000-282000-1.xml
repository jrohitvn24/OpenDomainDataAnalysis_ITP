		<content> There is very little to say about this
 block as it is all forest and comes   
 under the Forestry Commission as part 
 of the Thetford Forest and administry 
 of Santon Downham. Ref. 0580 0285.    
 There are 2 miles of the B1106 and 1m 
 of the A1065 passing through. Express 
 coaches to London use the A1065 but   
 there are no stops. Local coaches are 
 in a state of flux with their services
 especially since one large firm went  
 bankrupt this summer.(1985). Part of  
 anold track, the Shakers Road meets   
 the B1106 at Mayday Farm which is now 
 a F.C. depot.                         
 The small piece of heathland in the   
 west at Wangford Warren is left clear 
 to facilitate military aircraft to    
 land at Lakenheath Airfield.
