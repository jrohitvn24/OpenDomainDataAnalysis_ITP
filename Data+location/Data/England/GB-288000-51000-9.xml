   The area around Kingswear is nearly 
 all farmland.The majority of the land 
 is privately owned but aboat quarter  
 owned by the National Trust and       
 leased to tenants.In our D block there
 are four Farms. The main type of      
 farming carried out in this area is   
 mixed farming.This means that         
 farmers rear cattle for meat and milk 
 and sheep for meat and wool. They also
 grow wheat and barley together with   
 hay, silage and straw.Very few root   
 crops or other vegetables are grown.  
   I live on Croftland Farm.It has 122 
 acres. There are 50 sheep for wool    
 and 75 for meat and 20 breeding.We    
 have a herd of 90 cows,half for       
 breeding and half for milk.
