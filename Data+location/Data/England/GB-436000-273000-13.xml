		<title>13ST. LEONARD'S CHURCH, RYTON.</title>
		<content>{ St. Leonard's}was built in the late  
{11th.C.}of red sandstone rubble. The  
 somewhat large crenellated tower was  
 added in the 15th. C. Much{renovation 
 work has been carried out in recent   
 years. For a full account of the      
 church see;{"VICTORIA COUNTY HIST."   
{VOL.6; PP 210-213.                    
  The church is the oldest and most    
 significant building in the area. On  
 approaching Ryton from the south the  
 church is seen at it's best.          
  The church and the new{village hall, 
 over the A45, provide the village     
 with;a{meeting place}for some 15      
 groups;a dance and bingo hall, as well
 as being a religious centre. The      
 groups cover a wide range of interests
 and ages. There are{plans}to use the  
 hall as a Doctors's surgery until a   
 proper one can be set up. The British 
 Legion Club is next to the hall.      </content>
