		<content>    Undoubtedly the element of trust,  
 probably arising from familiarity, is 
 responsible for the sense of security.
 Some people still do not lock houses  
 or cars, and generally there is a     
 lesser fear of the growth in crime    
 found in other, less rural            
 communities.                          
    However, the publicity of crime in 
 all its forms, causes apprehension.   
 Even the growth of nearby villages is 
 causing people to take precautions    
 which up until now have been thought  
 unnecessary. For instance, children   
 are no longer allowed to ride their   
 bicycles to villages, on their own, as
 their parents had done.
