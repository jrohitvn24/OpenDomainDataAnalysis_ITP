		<title>11THE BAKERY  J EVELEIGH</title>
		<content> My name is Jim Eveleigh. I live at the
 Bakery Gittisham with my wife and two 
 daughters. (There have been Eveleighs 
 in Gittisham for hundreds of years).  
                                       
    The bakery is a working Bakery     
 and Grocers, selling in the village   
 and surrounding area from two vans. I 
 start work at about 5:15 am. We make  
 three types of bread; white is the    
 most popular, but wholemeal is now    
 second and is increasing all the time.
 We have recently started to make Top  
 Cobber, a wheatmeal with added malt   
 and whole grains. I use traditional   
 methods for mixing doughs using only  
 flour, salt yeast fat and milk powder 
 with no additives. The last of the    
 bread comes out of the oven at about  
 9:15 am, it is then loaded into the   
 vans and delivered to customers along 
 with groceries, fruit and vegetables. </content>
