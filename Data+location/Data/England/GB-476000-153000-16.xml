		<content> The{Basingstoke Canal}was opened in   
 the 1790's as a means of transport but
 since it has been restored it has     
 attracted many tourists to this       
 otherwise quiet corner of Hampshire.  
   The canal was jointly purchased by  
 Surrey &amp; Hampshire County Councils in 
 1974. The Surrey &amp; Hants Canal Society
 cleared the towpaths and dredged the  
 canal.The three bridges in this block 
 - namely Boseley's Bridge, Stacey's   
 Bridge &amp; Barley Mow Bridge - built in 
 1794, have been made safe or rebuilt. 
 During the past year a{public slipway 
 has been opened at Winchfield Wharf.  
 It is regularly used by people from   
 quite a radius to launch their craft. 
 For those who don't own boats{the     
{'John Pinkerton' narrow-boat makes    
{regular trips.}The towpath provides   
{scenic walks &amp; cycle rides}and a      
 pleasant location in which to fish.   </content>
