		<content> Mr. Davey took us to Tredydon Course  
 Fishing to do some bird watching.First
 of all we saw three Magpies flying    
 together.Then we saw a Pied Wagtail   
 and some Buzzards flying around in    
 circles.We also saw House Martins,    
 swallows,bullfinches,a carrion crow,a 
 spotted flycatcher,a collared dove,a  
 woodpidgeon,a pheasant,a chiffchaff   
 and a wren.Mr Davey said that it is   
 possible to see much more than these  
 species and thought it a pity we did  
 not spot a heron. Throughout our      
 visits we did not see any wild land   
 animals though we saw plenty of       
 evidence of their existence. At Rings 
 Wood rabbit burrows and droppings were
 seen,and elsewhere rabbit fur was     
 collected.We also had reports of      
 Badgers living in Trevallett Wood.Many
 of these and other animals are        
  considered pests by farmers.         </content>
