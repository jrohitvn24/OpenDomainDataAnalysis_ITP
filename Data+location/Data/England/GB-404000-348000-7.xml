		<content>Very often when farms are sold the land
is divided up into two or three lots.  
Sometimes the living accommodation is  
sold with just a small block of land,  
the rest of the land being sold to     
neighbouring farms.                    
                                       
Many problems face the farmers in this 
area. Those we spoke to mentioned the  
severe climate, the hilly wet ground,  
altitude and the Government's Milk     
Quota System.                          
                                       
There are several livestock markets    
within easy reach of our area. These   
include Leek, Newcastle, Uttoxeter,    
Bakewell, Derby and Chelford.          
                                       
Farming here is not easy but all the   
farmers agreed that if they relived    
their lives they would choose farming  
but not in this area.                  </content>
