		<title>07A Visit to St. John's Church</title>
		<content>Outside the Church we saw a shed it was
called a bier shed and on the Church   
there was a gargoyle.We made our way   
into the Church, we saw the bells,     
theree six bels in the Church, they are
about 400 years old.                   
In the Church there is a Font, it is   
where you get baptised. On the top it  
is the shape of an Octogon. Then we    
moved over and there was a list of     
Rectors and the first one here was in  
1301.In the Church there is a pulpit,  
that is where the Rector stands with   
his microphone to speak through it.    
The Chancel is where the choir sings.  
In the church there is an organ and at 
the back there is an alter. The roof   
of the church is called a hammer beam  
roof.                                  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
