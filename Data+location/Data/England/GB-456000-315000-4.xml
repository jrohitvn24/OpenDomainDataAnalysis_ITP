 Proctor's Park is a residential       
 caravan site.   It is by the River    
 Soar.   If you walk down Bridge Street
 you come to the park half way down on 
 the left.   Mr. Proctor owns the park 
 and it is roughly about 2 acres of    
 grass, water and concrete.   There are
 about 400 caravans on the site.   It  
 is quite a nice place to camp as it is
 near the river and there is a lot of  
 wildlife nearby.   The road that it is
 on (Bridge Street) is quite a noisy   
 street but you cannot hear much of the
 traffic from the park.   There are    
 some very pleasant walks, and there   
 are quite a few fields round about.
