		<title>17A FARMER'S DAY</title>
		<content>   The farmer usually gets up at about 
 6.30am and walks around his cattle and
 other livestock.He usually then has   
 breakfast &amp; decides what to do for the
 rest of the day.In the winter it may  
 be ploughing or seeding or any        
 maintenance job.In the spring &amp; summer
 it is usually looking after the young 
 animals or new crops and later it is  
 harvesting.Much of his time is now    
 spent in looking after the machinery  
 which costs many thousands of pounds. 
 After lunch sometimes he takes his    
 wife to the town where she shops while
 he goes to different stockists.The    
 farmer we talked to enjoyed the       
 evening best because he often walked  
 around his property looking at the new
 animals or growing crops.He said he   
 could think of nothing better than the
 job he had.
