		<content>    At school we play a variety of     
 games. The most popular game is       
 probably "321". First find a place to 
 be the post and someone to be "on it".
 This person has to count to 60 while  
 the others go and hide. When the      
 person has finished counting, he looks
 for the others. When he has seen      
 someone he goes back to the post and  
 shouts "I see(so and so), behind      
 (wherever he is)". The object of the  
 game is to "save all". This is done by
 touching the post when the person on  
 it is not looking and saying "321 I   
 save all".The first person caught is  
 on it next time.                      
    Any number of children can play    
 this game together.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
