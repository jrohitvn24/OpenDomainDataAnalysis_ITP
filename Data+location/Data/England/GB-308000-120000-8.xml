		<content> Most of land in our area is used for  
 grazing and growing grass for silage  
 but a few  crops are grown. Barley    
 wheat, maize and potatoes are the     
 main crops.Winter and Spring barley   
 are both grown and harvested but they 
 are only grown in the same field for  
 three years.Sowing them in a different
 field after that time prevents the    
 spread of viruses.The potatoes have to
 be sown in a different field each year
 otherwise wire worms attack the crop. 
 Weeds also ruin the  potatoes by      
 taking the goodness out of the soil,  
 so they are sprayed with weedkiller.  
 Farmers also use fertilizers made up  
 of potash, nitrogen and phosphate to  
 encourage good, strong, heaalthy      
 plants.The maize is grown to turn into
 silage for feed for the animals during
 the winter.
