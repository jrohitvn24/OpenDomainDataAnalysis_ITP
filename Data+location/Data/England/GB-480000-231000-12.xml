We went to visit Tattenhoe Church. We  
had to go down a very long muddy       
lane,through a gate and along a path in
a field to get to the little church.   
There are no houses near the church,   
but there are two cottages out on      
the  lane.At the end of the lane was a 
big house which was Tattenhoe Hall. The
church is in the middle of a field     
which is full of sheep.Near the church.
there are several moats which are very 
old. In the grave yard there were four 
graves,three were the Clarke family and
one grave had the name of Monk on it.  
The dates on the graves were between   
1910 and 1914. We felt very isolated   
standing by the church but we could see
the ring road going from Bletchley to  
Milton Keynes in the distance.
