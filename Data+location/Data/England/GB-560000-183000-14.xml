		<title>14THE VILLAGE SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   Our school is a{Church of England}  
 (Controlled) Primary School. It is    
 quite small, having only{three        
{classrooms.}It was built just over{a  
{hundred years}ago and the infant      
 classroom was added in 1974.          
   At present there are{eighty-eight   
{children}in school, their ages ranging
 from{four}to{eleven.}We have a{       
{headmaster,}who teaches for part of   
 the week, two full-time{teachers}and a
 part-time{supply teacher.}During the  
 week two other teachers visit, to     
 teach{P.E.}and{Games,}and{trumpet}and{
{cornet. }                             
   Other workers include five{dinner   
{ladies,}a{school asisstant}and a      
{cleaner.}Because our school is quite  
 small the dinners are cooked at       
 another school, about eight miles     
 away. They cost{60p}for infants and{  
{63p}for juniors.                      </content>
