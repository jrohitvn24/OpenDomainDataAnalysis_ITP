		<title>16Steetley Chapel.</title>
		<content>{ All Saints Church,}or{Steetley       
{Chapel,}was originally built in 1120, 
 probably by{Gley Le Breton}for his    
 own convenience as a private chapel   
 near his house. Although it is only   
 56feet long it has been called "the   
 most perfect and elaborate specimen   
 of{Norman architecture}to be found    
 anywhere in Europe". Nineteenth       
 century illustrations show the chapel 
 to be in a poor state of repair, prior
 to its restoration in 1880. Today the 
 chapel has only a small, regular      
 congregation of around 9 or 10, who   
 attend{Holy Communion}on the 1st and  
 3rd Sundays in the month, or{Evensong 
 on the 2nd, 3rd and 5th Sundays. The  
 chapel is said to be the one on which 
{Sir Walter Scott}based Copmanhurst in 
 his novel{Ivanhoe.
