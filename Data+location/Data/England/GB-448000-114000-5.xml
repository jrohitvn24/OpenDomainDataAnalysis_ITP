		<title>05ARE YOU A WITCH ?</title>
		<content> Since the earliest times people have  
 told stories about witches and the    
 evil spirits lurking around the       
 countryside.So much so that they      
 believe they are actually seeing      
 them.The tales are so persistent and  
 the descriptions so vivid about       
 them,that they are frequently beleived
 to be true.In the past people believed
 in witches and would punish them      
 horrifyingly with a number of very    
 painful punishments,such as burning at
 the stake or being crushed under a    
 board with stones piled on top of     
 it.Rumour has it that in Berrywood    
 copse there used to live a mother with
 her 3, daughters.The owner of the     
 land thought that 2 of the daughters  
 were witches so one night he crept out
 of bed and burnt the house down,      
 killing the whole family.Ever since   
 then there have been two sprits.      </content>
