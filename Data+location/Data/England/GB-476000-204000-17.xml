		<content> Mayday is a big event in Longwick.    
 Now organized jointly by the staff at 
 the school and the Longwick W.I., the 
 children of the village carry on a    
 tradition that has been continuous    
 since the l850's.  Early in the       
 morning on mayday they made garlands  
 and sceptres which originally were    
 carried from door to door while the   
 children sang a special song and asked
 tribute for their efforts.  The       
 special Longwick construction of the  
 garland consisted oftwo intersecting  
 hoops of willow festooned with flowers
 and with a doll suspended in the      
 centre. The sceptre was a solid cone  
 with flowers and greenery built round 
 a broom handle.  Both garland and     
 sceptre traditionally had a veil which
 could be drawn aside.  It was         
 essential that both  be topped with a 
 crown imperial lily.                  </content>
