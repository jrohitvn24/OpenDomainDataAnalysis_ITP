		<title>09TRANSPORT IN CHERINGTON</title>
		<content> The travel habits of children in the  
 rural South Cotswolds were assessed by
 a questionaire of 54 children.  Just  
 over half the children came to school 
 on foot, just under half by car and   
 one by bus.  None came by bicycle or  
 any other transport.  Asked how many  
 times a year they travel by train, 23 
 replied never, 14 once, 10 twice and 7
 more than twice.  One-fifth of the    
 sample had travelled by air in the    
 last 5 years, and two-fifths by car   
 ferry.
