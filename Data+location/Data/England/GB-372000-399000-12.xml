		<content> We went along the East Lancs Road, up 
 Newearth Road, past the Red Lion and  
 right along the bankings again. Then  
 we turned left onto Bedford field,    
 went up onto Bedford Avenue and into  
 school. We went up the field and back 
 and then had a glass of lemonade.     
 10.15am I went home and had a cup of  
 coffee and a read.                    
 12.00 I had my dinner, then washed up.
 2.00pm Stuart and dad came home and we
 watched TV.                           
 6.30pm Mum made tea. We had hamburger,
 sausages and chips and wine and some  
 buns.                                 
 7.00 We watched TV                    
 9.00pm I went to bed
