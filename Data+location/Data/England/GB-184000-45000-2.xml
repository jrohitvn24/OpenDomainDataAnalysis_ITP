 Pencalenick school is for children who
 have difficulty in learning.It used to
 be a Victorion mansion.It was built in
 1881.But the school was opened in     
 1952.The school was started because   
 the goverment didn't want the children
 who have difficulty in learning to sit
 at the back of the class doing        
 nothing.                              
  The school is also a boarding school.
