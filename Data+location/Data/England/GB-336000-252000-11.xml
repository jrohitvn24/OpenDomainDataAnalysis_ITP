		<title>11Clubs - National</title>
		<content> We visited farmers in the area and    
 discovered that the majority of them  
 belonged to one or several clubs or   
 societies in the surrounding district.
 The farmers belong to the National    
 Farmers Union, which is an organ-     
 isation that speaks for the farmers   
 interests on group, county and        
 national levels. The Young Farmers'   
 Clubs are extremely popular with their
 many social and educational activities
                                       
 Many of the ladies also attend the    
 Women's Institute at Pembridge, which 
 is also an organisation on three      
 levels.                               
                                       
 The farmers who breed pedigree        
 livestock belong to their respective  
 breed societies. One farmers wife     
 belongs to the Farm Womens Union which
 promotes British food.                </content>
