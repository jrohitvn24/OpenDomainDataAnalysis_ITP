		<title>04CARDING MILL VALLEY STRETTON</title>
		<content>  {Carding Mill Valley}is the most     
 popular valley in Church Stretton.    
 It is one of the many valleys or      
 batches cut into the Long Mynd. It    
 is owned by the{National Trust.}There 
 is a stream flowing down the valley   
 and alongside it for most of the way  
 is a road leading to a car park. If   
 you are not a local resident it costs 
 50p to park there for the day. There  
 is a cafe and a gift shop.            
  People of all ages visit Carding Mill
 Valley. Families enjoy picnics and the
 sheep are tame enough to enjoy them   
 too. The children come because in the 
 summer they can paddle in the stream  
 or slide down the hills on grass      
 sledges or cardboard boxes. In the    
 winter they can sledge on the snow.   
 Older people go for walks or just sit 
 enjoying the views and the unspoilt,  
 peaceful surroundings.                </content>
