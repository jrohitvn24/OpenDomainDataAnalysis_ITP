		<title>09The Hamilton Local Plan  3</title>
		<content> A modified local plan of the          
 proposed Hamilton development was     
 published in 1984 stressing the need  
 for around 4 000 homes in Leicester.  
 The last date for objections was      
 Friday 14th June 1985.                
                                       
 The modified plan would cover a       
 smaller area than the original plan   
 but would still swallow up a great    
 deal of grade two agricultural land.  
 The people living in the area are very
 concerned at the development and even 
 local builders have voiced their      
 concern. It seems to be the feeling   
 that the Hamilton development would be
 too similar to the unpopular Beaumont 
 Leys development in the north-west of 
 the city. There are concerns about    
 loss of farmland, countryside and even
 flooding along the River Soar.
