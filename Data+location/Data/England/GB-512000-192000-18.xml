		<content> The Carpenders Park Residents         
 Association works for the benefit of  
 this community.Through their elected  
 committee they try to improve the     
 quality of life and act as a pressure 
 group.Recently they have been         
 concerned with the provision of a     
 community hall.Land and money are now 
 both available and residents have been
 invited to express their opinion.They 
 have also formed a neighbourhood watch
 scheme to help combat the high        
 burglary rate.A newsletter is         
 published quarterly and delivered by  
 volunteers.The children in our class  
 think there should be more areas to   
 play with "NO DOGS ALLOWED" and that  
 insufficient attention was paid to the
 needs of the younger generation when  
 the estate was planned.
