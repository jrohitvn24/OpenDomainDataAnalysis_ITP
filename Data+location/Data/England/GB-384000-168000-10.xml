		<title>10CORSHAM'S TWIN TOWN</title>
		<content>  Corsham is twinned with Jargeau in   
 the South West of France. Visits take 
 place several times each year between 
 the people of the two towns. Jargeau  
 is famous for coal and sausages and is
 generally more industrialised than    
 Corsham. In April 1985 I went with    
 Corsham School Windband on a visit to 
 Jargeau. I stayed there for 5 days    
 with the Breton family. One thing I   
 noticed was the amount of food and    
 wine they consumed. They have over 600
 bottles of wine in their cellar. We   
 went to see a bridge known as the     
 "valle de loire". We visited the      
 schools and colleges and then looked  
 around the shops. On the last night we
 played in a concert for the mayor of  
 Jargeau and he said that he enjoyed it
 very much!
