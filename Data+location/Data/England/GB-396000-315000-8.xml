		<title>08Plants on Cannock Chase.</title>
		<content>    On the heathland areas, heather and
bracken predominate, but other dry     
heathland plants such as bilberry and  
cowberry are also widespread. The      
heathlands also provide a plant of     
special interest - the Cannock Chase   
Berry - a rare hybrid between bilberry 
and cowberry, and like them, it is     
edible.                                
    Along the stream in Sherbrook      
Valley there are boggy areas where the 
huge greater tussock sedge grows. Also 
to be found are cross leaved heath,    
cranberry and marsh thistle.           
    On the ground under the pines in   
the forest areas, little but bracken   
and a thin cover of grass is found.    
    Hawthorn, crab apple and gorse     
bushes can be found in the places where
military buildings once stood.
