		<content> Two girls from our school called Jayne
 Sadler and Jessica Turner went to the 
 Essex Arms for a competition to choose
 a Gala Queen and Princess. It was in a
 lounge room and a man asked them      
 questions. He said "Have you any pets 
 or brothers and sisters?" They were   
 both chosen, Jayne as the Gala Queen  
 and Jessica as the Princess. For      
 prizes they had a crown, bracelet and 
 a blue and pink dress with a frill    
 around the top and the bottom and a   
 sash. When they walked down they felt 
 scared. They were going to ride in a  
 car without a roof but if it rained   
 they would have the roof up. For the  
 competition Jessica wore a white dress
 with puffy sleeves and Jayne wore a   
 white dress. When Jayne got home her  
 Mum did not believe that she had won.
