		<title>03Cottingham, a Central Place</title>
		<content> One of the local people suggested to  
 me that Cottingham was an older place 
 than its larger neighbour Hull. Hull, 
 she insisted, merely acted as the port
 for Cottingham's rich farming produce.
 It boasts to be the largest village in
 England still and does remain separate
 from Hull.  For the geographer, it is 
 a superb example of a{Central Place.  
 There is little in its street pattern 
 to hint at formal planning and yet it 
 has all the services usually found in 
 a small market town rather than a     
 village.  The{data count}shows shows  
 over 70 shops and besides these it has
 a dozen or more service type shops    
 which could not enter the data count. 
 It has{council offices}and a library  
 which lend higher status to the label{
{Central Place.} Saturday mornings on  
 Hallgate busy with shoppers emphasize 
 its extreme self-contained nature.    </content>
