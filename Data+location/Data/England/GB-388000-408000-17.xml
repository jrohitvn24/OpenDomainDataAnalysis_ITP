		<title>17KIRKHOLT CLEAN-UP</title>
		<content> On Monday, 22nd. July, all the        
 children in the third year at Thornham
 Middle School took part in a massive  
 clean-up operation on Kirkholt Estate.
      The estate was built shortly     
 after the second world war and has    
 lots of open spaces for the residents 
 to enjoy, but some thoughtless people 
 had dumped rubbish in these places,   
 and even a little rubbish is enough to
 make the area look unsightly.         
      The Groundwork Trust organised   
 the activity and provided skips,      
 wheelbarrows and shovels.             
      The children worked all day,     
 sometimes in the rain, and by the end 
 of the day had collected about six    
 skip-fulls of rubbish.                
      We hope that the improvement will
 last, and that our actions will make  
 people think before they dump rubbish.
