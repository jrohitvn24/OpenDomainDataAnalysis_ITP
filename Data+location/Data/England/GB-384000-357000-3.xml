		<content>   Between the Staffordshire Moorlands 
and the Cheshire Plain rises a ridge of
Millstone grit which is four miles     
long,broadening at its southern end    
into a mountain just over 1,100 feet   
high.This is Mow Cop.The Cheshire side 
has the remains of an ancient oak      
woodland,which falls steeply to about  
400 feet.The Staffordshire side falls  
more gently into the Biddulph Valley.  
  The name is probably a corruption of 
Moel Cop could come from either old    
English Coepp or the latin Cappa,which 
means top or head.There is evidence    
that the Romans used this area for     
mining.During the 14th century querms  
were produced.Later coal became the    
important industry.Today there is just 
one mill producing Fustian.The land    
around is used mainly for rough grazing
and is dotted with remains of old      
quarries.                              </content>
