		<content>  The property is at the eastern edge  
 of the block, closer into the city of 
 Sheffield, dates from the 1930's      
 although several roads fall into an   
 area known as Fulwood, where the      
 houses are very large, three-story    
 stone properties with slate roofs,    
 dating from the 1880's. These         
 substantial homes are still largely   
 owned by a single family although     
 there is evidence of sub-division into
 flats and masionettes. Several of the 
 larger properties have been purchased 
 by businesses, notably computer and   
 insurance firms anxious to avoid the  
 high rates of city-centre office      
 blocks. Property built in the 1930's  
 is largely semi-detached and brick    
 built, often without garages, although
 progression westward leads to the bulk
 of the residential area which is less 
 than 20 years old.                    </content>
