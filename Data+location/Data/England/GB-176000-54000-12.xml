		<title>12Interviewing Campers</title>
		<content> At the campsite at the top end of     
 Budnic Estate we found some people to 
 interview.They were holiday makers.   
 Some came from foreign countries.They 
 all said they liked Perranporth       
 because it was interesting and it has 
 a beach .We interviewed three people. 
 We interviewed a lady who said,"I not 
 speak English!"So we went to a man.   
 We said, "Are you a visitor to        
 Perranporth?" He replied, "Yes!" A    
 girl came from Crawley near London.   
 Two  other men came from Hampshire and
 a man came from Leicester. The        
 campsite was only half full and quite 
 empty  at that time of the day which  
 was midday. The interviewed holiday   
 makers all agreed that Perranporth    
 was interesting and not too expensive.
 Most had tents though some had        
 caravans or dormobiles.They all hoped 
 for good weather.                     </content>
