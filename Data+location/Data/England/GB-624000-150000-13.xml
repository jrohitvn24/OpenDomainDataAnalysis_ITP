		<title>13A DAY WITH THE PARKER'S CONT</title>
		<content>  After play we all went swimming in   
 the school pool. We had some relay    
 races with just two people in each    
 team.The water was really warm today. 
 Soon it was time to get changed, we   
 put our chairs up, said prayers and   
 went home.                            
  When I got in my sister was playing  
 the piano as usual, it sounded awful. 
 I got a drink of apple juice and a    
 biscuit and read a magazine.          
  After dinner I went with my sister to
 a friend's house to do some baby      
 sitting.We watched T.V. for a while   
 and at 11.30. Mrs Scott came home and 
 she took us home. As it was rather    
 late when we got in I went straight to
 bed. Goodnight.                       
 ZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzz.......
