		<title>09SUBJECT OPTIONS AT SCHOOL</title>
		<content>{*}When you are transferred from a     
 primary school to a secondary school  
 not only is the system different,but  
 you are also taught a whole series    
 of different subjects,some of them    
 completely new:mathematics,science,   
 history,music,drama,art and craft,    
 physical education and French.        
{*}In the second year we were able to  
 do German as well.                    
{*}In the third year science was       
 divided into physics,chemistry and    
 biology.                              
{*}By the end of the third year we were
 in a good position to choose options. 
{*}I have chosen the following         
 subjects:modular science,home         
 economics,community studies,keyboard  
 skills and business                   
 studies.English,mathematics and       
 physical education are compulsory     
 subjects.                             </content>
