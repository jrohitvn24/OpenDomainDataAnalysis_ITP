		<title>05THE VILLAGE OF CHARLTON</title>
		<content>  Charlton is a very small hamlet,     
 situated at the end of a no through   
 road.It relies on its neighbour,      
 Creech Heathfield,for many amenities. 
  Creech Heathfield provides a doctor  
 and a policeman but,sadly missed by   
 the people of Charlton is a resident  
 nurse.They can use the clubs that are 
 run by their neighbouring village.    
 Examples are the Women's Institute,   
 Scouts,Over 60's and a Photographic   
 Club.                                 
  Except for one businessman,who has   
 bought Charlton Manor,all the         
 residents of Charlton are employed    
 locally,working their own or a        
 neighbour's land.On one farm they keep
 Jersey cows and chickens.Another      
 farmer has changed from dairy farming 
 to cereal growing and now also breeds 
 pheasants.Charlton Orchards is the    
 other farming enterprise.             </content>
