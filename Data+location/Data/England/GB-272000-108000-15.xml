		<content> Nothing of national{historical}       
 interest has happened in or near      
 Lapford,but people have lived here for
 well over two and a half thousand     
 years.{Excavations}at Bury Barton,just
 South of our area  and only a mile    
 from Lapford, have shown that people  
 have lived there since{Celtic}times at
 least.A protective bank and ditch was 
 built there then to guard the hilltop 
 setlement, and those banks still      
 remains.The second{Roman}Legion from  
 Exeter sent a large cohort north west 
 to North Devon and Cornwall,and built 
 a fort within the old{Celtic}walls,   
 the corner watch towers of which have 
 been recently excavated.Then when the{
{Saxons}arrived soon after 660 A.D a   
 farm was built on the same site,and   
 the first little church and homesteads
 built in Lapford.
