   At lunchtime{115}children eat school

 and{21}go home. We have two{computers}

{stick insects}as pets. We do dancing  
 and P.E. on apparatus.                
   We have an{adventure playground}    
 where there is a tunnel, three        
 ladders, three ropes, a log house and 
 a little fort to remind us of the fort
 on Wincobank Hill.                    
   We have been on school trips to a{  
{zoo}and a{mill.}When we leave this    
 school we go to{Concord Middle School.
 We like this school because we like   
 the teachers and we like the work.    </content>
