		<title>14A Day in my Life (1)</title>
		<content>  I got up at 7o'clock and had a bath  
and got ready for school.Mum goes to   
work early so I went to Cheryl's house 
and helped her to put the rubbish out  
for the dustmen.When I got to school I 
had a little play before the whistle   
went.Then we lined up and went in and  
had the register.In assembly we had a  
story  about some men in a boat in a   
storm.They were saved by a lifeboat.   
The whole school had quiet reading     
after assembly and then my class had a 
spelling test and maths until playtime 
at half past ten.                      
  After play we had a singing lesson   
and then did some more maths.          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
