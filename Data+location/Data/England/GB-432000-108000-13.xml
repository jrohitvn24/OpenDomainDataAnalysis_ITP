		<content> About half of the area is covered by  
 Forestry Commission plantations. Most 
 of these are coniferous woodland.     
 There is also some heathland and in   
 the lower part of this there is an    
 area of bog which has many sundews    
 growing there. In the woods there are 
 deer, foxes and many other animals as 
 well as the usual insects. There are  
 also many wild flowers and of the     
 woodland is covered by a dense        
 undergrowth of ferns and brambles. The
 Forestry Commission is responsible for
 most of the conservation in this area.
