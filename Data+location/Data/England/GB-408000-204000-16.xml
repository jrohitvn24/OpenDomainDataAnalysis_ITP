		<title>16BIBURY VILLAGE LIFE MAGAZINE</title>
		<content> The first Village Life Magazine was   
 published in October 1979 when a group
 of villagers thought it would be a    
 good idea to have a magazine to help  
 communication within the villages. it 
 is an independent magazine, the cost  
 being met by local businesses         
 advertising in the Trade Directory,   
 and by donations, and fund raising    
 events. The magazine consists of dates
 for the diary, recipes, childrens     
 corner, church services and notes of  
 general interest. It comes out once a 
 month except for August. A free copy  
 is given to every house in Bibury,    
 Ablington, Arlington and Winson. Eight
 people from the villages concerned run
 the magazine, including the editor and
 treasurer. Everything for the magazine
 is supplied from the village including
 the drawings on the covers, some of   
 which come from holding competitions. </content>
