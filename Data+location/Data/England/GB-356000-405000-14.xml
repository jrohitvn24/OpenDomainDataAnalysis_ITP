		<title>14CHANGE IN INCE, WIGAN</title>
		<content>{INDUSTRY} - Ince has changed; its old 
 heavy industrial backdrop of factories
 and long ribbons of terraced housing  
 has gone. Smaller industries, light   
 engineering particularly,now dominate.
 Gullick-Dobson remains the world      
 leader in making mining supports.     
{HOUSING } - In 1985 Ince's environment
 is more pleasant with green areas     
 covering once derelict land. The      
 houses are semi-detached or modern    
 "town" style with small gardens.      
{TRANSPORT}- There are regular bus     
 routes and a railway station on the   
 Manchester-Wigan-Southport line. Our  
 survey showed that Manchester Road    
 should be a 4-lane carriageway instead
 of 2-lane given the volume of traffic.
{SHOPPING} - This has changed too, from
 small corner shops to supermarkets.   
 The new Smithy Green precinct should  
 attract new trade to the town centre. </content>
