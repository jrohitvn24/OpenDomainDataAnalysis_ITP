		<title>10BANK FARM IN TUDELEY</title>
		<content> BANK FARM IS RENTED BY MR. VEALL, ONE 
 OF OUR SCHOOL GOVERNORS, FROM THE     
 HADLOW ESTATE. IT IS NOW RUN BY HIS   
 SON BERNARD. BANK FARM COMPRISES 180  
 ACRES AND GROWS MOSTLY WHEAT, BARLEY, 
 HAY AND BRAMLEY APPLES. IT USED TO BE 
 THREE DIFFERENT FARMS - BANK FARM,    
 LILLEY FARM AND CHURCH FARM. BANK FARM
 HAS BEEN WORKED BY THE VEALL FAMILY   
 SINCE 1941. THE FARMHOUSE IS OVER 400 
 YEARS OLD, TWO NEARBY FARM COTTAGES   
 WERE BUILT JUST AFTER THE SECOND WORLD
 WAR. THE RAILWAY FROM TONBRIDGE TO    
 FOLKESTONE CUTS ACROSS BANK FARM LAND.
 A PRIZE HERD OF RED SUSSEX CATTLE USED
 TO BE KEPT AT BANK FARM BUT NOW       
 SCOTTISH MASHAM SHEEP ARE REARED WHICH
 ARE EXPORTED TO FRANCE FOR MEAT.      
 A PROFITABLE SIDELINE AT BANK FARM IS 
 THE AGRICULTURAL CONTRACT WORK FOR    
 OTHER FARMERS SUCH AS HEDGE CUTTING   
 AND SPRAYING.                         </content>
