		<title>04MIDDLE RASEN-PRESENT DAY</title>
		<content> The modern village of Middle Rasen has
 been eclipsed by its neighbour to the 
 east Market Rasen. In recent years new
 properties have been built and there  
 is now a fair cross-section of society
 in the village.Newcomer Professionals 
 and locals alike try to create a      
 village spirit. There is still the    
 village Primary School with 90 pupils 
 who transfer to De Aston Comprehensive
 School at 11. There is no industry in 
 the village, most of the population   
 travel to either Lincoln,Grimsby or to
 Market Rasen to work. There is now a  
 tendency for people to retire to what 
 has become a 'dormitory' village.     
 Whilst retaining the usual village    
 amenities and organisations(W.I.      
 etc.), its church and Methodist       
 Chapel,the village relies quite       
 heavily on Market Rasen.
