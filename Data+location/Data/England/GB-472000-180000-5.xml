		<title>05Henley and Falaise Link</title>
		<content>The link was first estblished in 1972. 
Mrs. Rigg, whom we interviewed, has    
been on the committee since 1979.      
There are 14 people on the committee   
and they meet once a month.            
   Henley chose Falaise because the    
towns are similar. Falaise is famous   
because William the Conquerer was born 
there and the battle of Falaise 1944.  
   The mayor and council first thought 
of the link. There are activities      
between the two towns and two of the   
activities are tennis and football.    
   Sometimes parties of people go over 
to Falaise to make friends.The local   
Secondary school, Gillotts sends       
parties of children every year over to 
Falaise.In Falaise they send parties of
children over to Henley in an exchange.
