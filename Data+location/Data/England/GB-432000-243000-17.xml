		<title>17TYSOE LOCAL HISTORY</title>
		<content> The name Tysoe derives from "Tiw's    
 Hoh" or a spur of hillside dedicated  
 to the Saxon war-god Tiw. Evidence    
 from folk memory and historical       
 documents show that a Red Horse was   
 cut in the hillside above Tysoe,      
 giving its name to the Vale of the Red
 Horse. Research and aerial photography
 in the 1960s show that three horse    
 figures were cut in the slope called  
 The Hangings above Old Lodge Farm at  
 different times - one of them a huge  
 galloping horse about 100yds x 70 yds.
 in size. Later figures were cut at Sun
 Rising Covert and Spring Hill, but    
 none are now visible.                 
 There is evidence of two Roman sites -
 one on Sun Rising Hill, and the other 
 in a field above Middle Tysoe.        
 In the Civil War, Tysoe was billeted  
 by parliamentary troops before the    
 battle of Edgehill.                   </content>
