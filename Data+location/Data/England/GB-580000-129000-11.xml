		<content>{MAKER OF STRINGED INSTRUMENT:Mr Grigg 
 began work as a Pattern and Model     
 Maker, later teaching woodwork in Kent
 Schools.  He became interested in     
 violins, started doing repairs.  This 
 led to making{violins, violas}and     
{cellos.} The detailed and precision   
 work in Pattern and Model making is   
 now put to use in instrument making   
 which he carries out in a small       
 workshop in his garden.               
    The front of a violin is made from 
 Spruce - a soft wood; the top, neck   
 and ribs from Maple - a hard wood.    
 The combination of these two has been 
 proved to give the best sound.        
    Mr. Grigg also repairs bows and    
 stringed instruments for schools and  
 professional musicians.  A highlight  
 was being invited to Covent Garden,   
 where one of his Cellos and a Viola   
 were being played.                    </content>
