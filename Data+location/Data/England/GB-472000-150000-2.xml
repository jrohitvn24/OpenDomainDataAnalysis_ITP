		<content> In and around Odiham, the Alder Valley
 bus service provides transport to     
 Farnham and Basingstoke via Hook. The 
 nearest railway station is at Hook,   
 one and a half miles away. Two private
 housing estates have been developed in
 the last six years. Many of the houses
 in the Odiham area are privately      
 owned.                                
 Married quarters at R.A.F Odiham      
 provide accomodation for service      
 personnel at the station. There are   
 two housing estates, owned by the Hart
 District Council in the area. Three   
 schools, an Infant, a Junior and a    
 Secondary-comprehensive, provide for  
 the educational needs of children up  
 to the age of sixteen. Further        
 education is provided in Basingstoke  
 colleges. Evening classes for adults  
 are held in the Junior and Secondary  
 schools in the area.                  </content>
