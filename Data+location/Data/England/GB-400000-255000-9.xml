		<title>09ST.PETER'S CHURCH,INKBERROW.</title>
		<content> The church is called Saint Peter's and
 it has a clock tower with a flag      
 pole.Sometimes the flag is up and you 
 can see it from the school.In the     
 tower there are some bells and they   
 are rung by pulling ropes.The church  
 is built of stone from the old quarry 
 down Stonepits Lane.It stands on a    
 hill.The east wall is 3 feet          
 deep.There was a church in the time of
 the Domesday book but none of that    
 remains.The oldest part was built in  
 the 13th century.We go to church to   
 decorate the font for the Harvest     
 Festival.We cut down some thorns and  
 our scissors broke just as we did the 
 last bit.A lot of people go to the    
 services.The Brownies,Guides,Cubs and 
 Scouts often parade their colours.A   
 new vicar was inducted a few weeks ago
 and there was a special service.
