 ________________                      
 The woods in our area are very        
 overgrown with brambles,overgrown     
 grass and weeds.Many children play in 
 the woods and destroy its natural     
 beauty by throwing litter in it.      
                                       
 STANMER WOODS                         
 _____________                         
 Stanmer wood is very large and has    
 very wide pathways,which have been    
 trod down.A lot of people spend their'
 leisure time walking around the wood, 
 although rapes and attacks are not    
 unknown.The woods are also used for   
 cross-country running,and horse       
 trials.
