		<content>{Caldwell}has few amenites and has had 
 no houses built during the last 15    
 years but most people are satisfied,  
 enjoying the quiet surroundings. Some 
 people would like a village green or  
 play area and a speed limit.          
{ Eppleby}has more amenites but the    
 majority of people would like         
 improvements. The main ones suggested 
 are to have the roads round the green 
 mended, a better bus service, a       
 recreation area for children, to build
 more houses and improve those in New  
 Row, to plant trees and put benches on
 the green.
