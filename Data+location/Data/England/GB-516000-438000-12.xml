 Bulldog                               
 1.You need lots of people to play     
   bulldog.                            
 2.One person stands in the middle of  
   where you are playing. The other    
   people stand at one end together.   
 3.The person in the middle says a name
   like Clare so Clare has to run      
   across without getting caught. If   
   you do get caught the person in the 
   middle says B.B.1.2.3.then you are  
   caught and help to catch the others.
 4.If you happen to get past the       
   other people can run pass too.      
 5.When everyone is caught the second  
   person who was caught is on.        
 6.German Bulldog is nearly the same   
   except instead of people's names    
   being called subjects are chosen    
   instead.You run across when your    
   subject is called.                  </content>
