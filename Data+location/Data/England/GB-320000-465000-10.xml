		<content> His milking apparatus is 30 years old.
 Mr. Pearson obviously takes pride in  
 his farm.                             
                                       
          {WAVER FARM}                 
 Waver farm was built in 1802.They only
 grow crops to feed the animals.The    
 farm has been in the family for 50    
 years.It's a dairy farm but going back
 a few years it would have been        
 mixed.The farm has only cows.The cows 
 are milked twice a day.The cows give  
 2-3 gallons every time but when they  
 are newly calfed they give twice      
 that.The milk has increased over the  
 past 10 years due to feeding.Most of  
 the milk goes to Kendal,but that is   
 what  is not bottled by the farmer and
 his wife.The rest goes to Barrow      
 Co-op after pasturising and bottling.
