		<content> This is evidence of the presence of   
 a rmed forces in the Halesworth       
 Section                               
 between 9 7 85 and 12 7 85.USAF 18    
a-10s,6 Hercules,1 phantom.RAF 4       
Tornados and 1 Canberra.There are      
USAF personnel at Corner House,Rectory 
ST.,57 Chediston ST.,Oak Green,        
Bedingfield Crescent,Barons Close and  
28 Norwich RD.There are also British   
Army Cadets who have their own hut and 
Landrover at Market Place,Halesworth.  
The school is an identification point  
for both American and British          
Airforces.It is so because the Middle  
School is on the highest ground around 
Halesworth and consequently we see many
low flying aircraft.And at the moment  
we have two sons of an American Officer
at this school.
