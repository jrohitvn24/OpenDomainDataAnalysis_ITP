		<title>06AYLESTONE MEADOWS (part 1)</title>
		<content>      Between the A46 and the A426 lie 
 the{Aylestone Water Meadows.}Through  
 the meadows, along the valley, pass   
 the{River Soar,}the{Grand Union Canal 
 and what was once the{Great Central   
{Railway.}The old villages of{Aylestone
 and{Braunstone}(Saxon derived names)  
 are linked across the meadows by      
{Braunstone Lane,}once called Coalpit  
 Lane, because it was the easiest route
 for horse-drawn wagons from the West  
 Leicester coal pits. The{"packhorse   
{bridge"}from the old Coalpit Lane can 
 still be seen in Aylestone.           
      This area is very susceptible to 
 flooding, but has been built-up in    
 places to provide sports facilities   
 for tennis, cricket, rounders and     
 soccer. There is also a riding school,
 park and childrens play area. This    
 whole area is now mainly used for     
 leisure.                              </content>
