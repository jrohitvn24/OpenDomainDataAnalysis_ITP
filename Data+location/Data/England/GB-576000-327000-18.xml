		<title>18PEDDARS WAY -HOUGHTON</title>
		<content> This way or track is thought to have  
 been constucted by the Romans after   
 the Boadiccean revolt during the fist 
 century A.D.It would have conveyed    
 troops and official traffic through   
 Iceni teritory to the Wash ferry and  
 thence to Lincolnshire and the North  
 of England.Certainly, after its       
 constuction there was no further Iceni
 rebellion.The way is no longer of     
 strategic or political importance; it 
 is now a lonely, fascinating track for
 walkers, open to the high wide skies  
 in an area known as the Root of       
 Norfolk.It is bounded on both sides by
 arable land and on Harpley Common     
 there is a group of round barrows. The
 origins of its name are obscure but   
 the most likely meaning is that of    
 "foot" road.
