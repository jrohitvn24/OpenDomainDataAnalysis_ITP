		<title>16Children's Leisure Pursuits</title>
		<content> Most children have{television}in their
 homes and watch it for at least 7     
 hours per week. Some children prefer  
 to read, cook, sew or play a{musical  
{instrument}such as piano, guitar,     
 recorder or violin. Indoors they may  
 play board games, spend time drawing  
 and colouring or making models. Many  
 have home{micro-computers}and use them
 to play arcade-type games.            
 Out of doors the most popular games   
 are{skipping}for girls and{football   
 for boys. Many ride{bicycles}or play  
 on swings or climbing frames, perhaps 
 at a recreation ground.               
 About a third go to{classes}for       
 gymnastics, ballet, disco dancing or  
 judo. A few go horse-riding.          
 Up to the age of about 10 years most  
 children play in or near the home. As 
 they get older they tend to become    
 more venturesome.                     </content>
