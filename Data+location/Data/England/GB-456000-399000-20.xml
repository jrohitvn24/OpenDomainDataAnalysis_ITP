		<title>20LOCAL HISTORY BALBY</title>
		<content> Balby is a small dormitory suburb of  
 Doncaster. It is approximately 1.5    
 miles from the town centre. Balby is  
 an ancient homestead since it is      
 mentioned in the original Domesday    
 Book as Balbeii. It is said that in   
 the 17th century the Quaker George Fox
 held meetings here finding the people 
 more tolerant than those of Warmsworth
 where he was stoned.                  
   There is little local industry      
 though some disused quarries indicate 
 that limestone was quarreid here in   
 the past. Most people work in         
 Doncaster carried there by an         
 excellent bus service. Most shopping  
 is done there. In Balby a modern      
 sewage disposal unit has been built to
 serve Hexthorpe, Balby and Alverley.  
 Housing in Balby is divided between   
 private and council owned.
