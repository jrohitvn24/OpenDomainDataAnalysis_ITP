		<title>17The Summer Spectacular</title>
		<content>  The Summer Spectacular is an annual  
event held at Heron Brook Middle       
School, Gnosall.                       
  The main event this year was a pike  
and musket drill and a skirmish by     
members of Colonel Richard Bagot's     
Sealed Knot Charity. They fired a      
cannon   which was very loud and some  
muskets which weren't quite so loud.   
  There were many other attractions    
including a traction engine and        
trailer,a tug-of-war contest between   
local pubs and clubs, radio-controlled 
model cars, tombola, refreshments and  
many games and stalls. The school      
orchestra played and there were pony   
rides. It was a lovely sunny afternoon 
and the event was very well  supported 
by the local community.                
  It   was a very successful day.      
Everyone had a good time and over 1000 
pounds was raised for the school.      </content>
