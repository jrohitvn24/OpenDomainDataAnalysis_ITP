		<content> Development of Balcombe village centre
 survey undertaken by the children of  
 Balcombe C.E. Primary,with the help of
 parents and members of the W.I.       
                                       
  Balcombe village developed along the 
 Cuckfield,London Rd where it branches 
 towards Ardingly and Haywards Heath.It
 is also on the London_Brighton main   
 line railway,opened in 1841.The       
 housing survey showed the growth of   
 the village after the railway         
 opened,and after 1939_1945 war,when it
 became a popular place for commuters  
 working in London,Brighton,and the    
 Gatwick/Crawley area.                 
  The two main roads show a            
 considerable amount of infilling,which
 is still going on with three large new
 houses being built in the heart of the
 village this year.
