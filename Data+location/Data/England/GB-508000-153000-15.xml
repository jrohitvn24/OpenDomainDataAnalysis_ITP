		<content>  Horsley is in a{stockbroker belt}    
 attracting various types.{Bill Moore} 
{and Mollie Sugden}are local television
 stars.They have lived in the area for 
 18 years bringing up 2 sons and       
 sending them to local schools.They    
 were attracted by the greenery and    
 space;but as it is less convenient    
 for work than where they lived before 
 they often use public transport.      
  They think they are well catered for 
 in Horsley although they like doing   
 charity work but find it difficult to 
 help this community.Since they have   
 lived in Horsley they have seen many  
 changes.{The village has become more }
{built up and very busy.}Before the    
 village was quieter with less traffic.
 The traffic has become too urban and  
 they are moving to a more rural area.
