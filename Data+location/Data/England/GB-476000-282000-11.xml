		<title>11A Day In My Life</title>
		<content>On Saturday I woke up at 7 o'clock,went
downstairs to have breakfast.Then I    
went shepherding with Dad when I came  
back I had a cup of coffee.Then I rang 
James but he was not playing so I went 
into the living room and watched T.V.  
until 1 o'clock when I had dinner.After
that I helped Dad on the farm feeding  
the animals until 5 o'clock.When I had 
finished I watched Blockbusters and the
A Team and had tea.After tea I had a   
game of cards with my sister Kate,Alex 
my Dad and Sue my Mum.We played Whist  
and then watched the Nine O'clock News.
I got ready for bed,brushed my teeth,  
washed my face and hands and got into  
bed to sleep.           Charles Handy.
