		<title>17All about Braceborough.</title>
		<content> This is a small village with one      
 church.The church is called St.       
 Margarets.There are hardly any cars,  
 only one bus a week and the village is
 quiet.Most of the 15 houses are big   
 and old with thatched or Collyweston  
 tiled roofs.The people here are       
 friendly.The Post Office is like a    
 house but with a post office added to 
 it.The village has no public house,   
 but it used to have one called the    
 'Foaming Tankard.It then became an off
 license and then a private house. The 
 village church is very old and has two
 services a month.Most people in here  
 work in jobs connected with           
 agriculture.Recently Braceborough     
 House has become a retirement home for
 12 elderly people and some of the     
 village women work there.The children 
 go to school by bus and like it when  
 the village is cut off by bad weather.</content>
