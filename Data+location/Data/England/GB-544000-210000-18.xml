		<title>18CONSERVATION IN HARLOW .</title>
		<content> Close to{Harlow}can be found{pollution
 in the way of rubbish, but the woods  
 by the river were neatly{conserved }  
 until we went further in, where there 
 was barbed wire and razor wire _ very 
 unsightly.Out of the wood,near the    
 A414, some broken stiles were being   
 replaced,others were left broken.The  
{River Stort}had been dredged so that  
 the water wouldn't break down the     
 banks.Wild bluebells (pink,blue and   
 white) grew by the river and further  
 on were rabbit holes.                 
 At{Lodge Farm}the farmer said that    
 deer and partridges were were on his  
 land,together with other wild life.   
 He bred partridges in a pen to protect
 them in order to replace the birds    
 which had been hunted and shot.Since  
{Harlow}became a clean air zone he had 
 to pollute the atmosphere by spraying 
 crops with sulphur to help growth.    </content>
