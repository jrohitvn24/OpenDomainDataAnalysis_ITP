 To have animals as pets seems very    
 popular in the area.These fall into   
 3 main categories. The first is       
 conventional pets like                
 rabbits,cats,gerbils,dogs and         
 goldfish.Then there are ponies or     
 sheepdogs which are part hobby, part  
 pet.Finally there are animals linked  
 with the farm such as goats and       
 poultry, which are as much investment 
 and income as friends of the          
 family.With the availability of fields
 and buildings in the area both the    
 second and the third groups are       
 widespread.Often local events involve 
 some of the animals and therefore are 
 well supported.Shows like those at    
 Alne,Husthwaite and even Harrogate    
 assume an important place in the      
 calender.
