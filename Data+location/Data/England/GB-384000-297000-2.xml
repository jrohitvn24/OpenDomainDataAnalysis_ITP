Perton, Staffordshire is an area       
situated about six to eight miles from 
the town of Wolverhampton. To the west 
of Perton Village is the old settlement
of Perton-once it was the only         
settlement in the area-today it is a   
lane of expensive homes. Nearby is the 
hamlet of Trescott this consists of    
a few houses and farm buildings along  
the main road to Bridgnorth. To the    
east is Castlecroft, which is part of  
Wolverhampton town. Here you would be  
able to walk along a disused railway   
track or walk along the banks of the   
Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal.
North of Castlecroft is Wightwick      
Manor, here you can find Smestow       
Brook.
