		<content> THERE IS NOT A LOT OF DEVIANCY FROM   
 THE LAWS OF THE LAND, AND THE AREA IS 
 POLICED BY THE LOCAL CONSTABULARY, WHO
 MAY BE SUMMONED BY TELEPHONING 999    
 WHEN TROUBLE OCCURS.                  
{THEFTS AND BURGLARIES}ARE NOT UNKNOWN,
 BUT THEIR FREQUENCY IS LESS THAN IN   
 THE CITY.                             
 THERE ARE SOME ACTS OF{VANDALISM      
 EVIDENT WHICH PARTICULARLY ANNOY THE  
 OLDER, VILLAGE OCCUPANTS. THESE ARE   
 OFTEN CAUSED BY A SMALL MINORITY OF   
 THE LOCAL YOUTHS. VARIOUS THEORIES ARE
 SUGGESTED AS TO WHY THIS OCCURS, THE  
 MOST COMMON ONE RELATING TO THE HIGH  
 LEVELS OF{UNEMPLOYMENT}AND THE LACK OF
 PROSPECTS OPEN TO THE YOUNG.

 THIS SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED BY THE      
 PUPILS AND STAFF OF HORSFORD MIDDLE   
 SCHOOL.                               </content>
