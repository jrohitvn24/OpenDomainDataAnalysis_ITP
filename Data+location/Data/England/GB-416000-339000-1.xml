		<title>01YEAVELEY VILLAGE</title>
		<content>    Yeaveley village is in the middle  
 of Derbyshire. It is quite a small    
 village. There is a pub called The    
 Horse Shoe Inn and a Church. The Post 
 Office and Shop closed down this year.
 The Primary School will be closing    
 this year too.                        
    There are about 80 houses in the   
 village, some of them are Council     
 houses.                               
    In the village there is a mushroom 
 farm, a small nursery, an agricultural
 engineer, a Clay Pigeon Shoot and a   
 small Riding School.                  
    There are about 25 farms in and    
 around Yeaveley. Most of the land     
 around the village is pasture land for
 grazing sheep and dairy cattle or for 
 hay or silage. The land is owned by   
 the local farmers.                    
    Yeaveley was mentioned in the      
 original Domesday Survey.             </content>
