		<title>13Farming: changes since 1930s</title>
		<content> Local farms have become fewer but lar-
 ger and workforces smaller. One Wysall
 farm used to have 7 labourers living  
 in and in the 1939-45 war land army   
 girls and prisoners of war worked     
 there. Today the farmer farms 200     
 acres but employs only one man, who   
 lives in a tied cottage. Mechanisation
 has reduced the need for men and      
 horses. This farm once had 12 or 14   
 working horses; now it has none. Milk-
 ing machines were introduced 50 years 
 ago but cows had to be tied up in     
 stalls; 10 years ago a milking parlour
 was installed; feed is given according
 to milk yield, which has risen, and   
 hygiene is better. Cattle may still be
 fed hay but silage is better food     
 value and can be cropped twice a year.
 Modern balers make round hay bales,   
 which are unrolled and spread for     
 animal bedding, so saving labour.     </content>
