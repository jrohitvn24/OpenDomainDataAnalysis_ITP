		<content>     At present the College owns one   
 hundred and thirty acres. This        
 contains Sparken Hill Farm. The farm  
 buildings are leased to a solicitor   
 and the fields are farmed by a        
 neighbouring farmer.                  
     The College now has thirty eight  
 full time members of staff who have   
 graduated from universities and are   
 not necessarily locals. However the   
 College does employ thirteen part time
 members of staff e.g. musicians who do
 live locally.                         
     When the students (some of whom   
 come from as far away as Scotland and 
 even Hong Kong) are in their first    
 year they are given a 'cabin' which   
 contains a desk and some shelves. In  
 either their second or third year they
 move into larger studies. Most pupils 
 sleep in dormitories which contain as 
 many as forty beds.                   </content>
