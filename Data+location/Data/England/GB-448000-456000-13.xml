		<content> FARMING IS ARABLE AND MIXED IN EQUAL  
 PROPORTIONS. GRAIN IS THE MAIN CROP ON
 LAND AWAY FROM NORMAL FLOOD LEVELS.   
 SOME LAND IS USED FOR SOFT FRUIT,     
 MAINLY STRAWBERRIES. THERE ARE STILL  
 MANY SMALL ENCLOSED PASTURES BUT THERE
 IS A GROWING TENDENCY TO OPEN OUT     
 LARGE ARABLE FIELDS. ALONG THE INGS   
 THE PASTURE LAND IS OPEN AND GRAZED BY
 CATTLE AND SHEEP. PONIES AND HORSES   
 OCCUPY PADDOCKS ROUND FARMS. ONE NUN  
 MONKTON FARMER BREEDS TROTTING PONIES 
 FOR SALE AND EXPORT. THREE LARGE FARMS
 ARE GROUPED TOGETHER TO FORM A LIMITED
 COMPANY SUPPLYING GRAIN FOR A BISCUIT 
 FIRM. ALSO CONNECTED IS A SPIRIT AND  
 WINE WHOLESALE COMPANY. FARMING IS    
 MECHANISED, THERE ARE FEW FARM WORKERS
 EMPLOYED AND NO LIVING-IN FARM        
 SERVANTS. SOME HAY IS PRODUCED BUT    
 SILAGE MAKING IS INCREASING.
