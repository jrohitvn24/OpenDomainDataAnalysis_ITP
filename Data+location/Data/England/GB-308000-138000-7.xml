		<content>      When we first went into the Post 
 Office it appeared very small.It was  
 like a cupboard.The owner and         
 Postmaster,Mrs Cartwright explained   
 that the{Post Office}was at first the 
 garage of her home.Two years ago they 
 decided to convert it into a Post     
 Office for the benefit of the Village.
     It took a long time to obtain     
{permission for the conversion}and then
 to build and to get all the stock     
 in.                                   
     Before they could open it they had
 to{receive training}on the  running of
 a village Post Office. They carry a   
 wide range of Post Office goods and   
 T.V. licences. They have stamps up    
 to Â£5 in value and also many other    
 things conncected with a small sub    
 Post Office.
