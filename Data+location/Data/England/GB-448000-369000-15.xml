		<title>15HILLSTOWN FAIR.</title>
		<content>      A fair comes to Hillstown every  
 year, usually in late June or early   
 July. It arrives on Tuesday and opens 
 on Thursday evening of the same week. 
 It is also open on Friday,Saturday,   
 Monday ans sometimes Tuesday evenings 
 and Saturday afternoon.               
      The fair consists of four main   
 rides- a Waltzer, Dodgem Cars, Cyclone
 and Motocross (usually called         
 Speedway). The average price is about 
 30p per person. In addition to the    
 main rides there are several rides for
 the small children and quite a few    
 stalls where you can win coconuts,    
 goldfish and other small prizes. To   
 complete the fair there are two or    
 three amusement arcades that house the
 usual space invader-type computer     
 games.                                
      The fair has usually packed up   
 and gone the day after it last opens. </content>
