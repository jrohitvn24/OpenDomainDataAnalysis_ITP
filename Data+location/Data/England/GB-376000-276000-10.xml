		<content> The Forestry Commission planted large 
 areas of Douglas Fir c.1926 which is  
 due to mature 1980-90. Good timber    
 will be produced for{construction}    
 work. Larch, which produces good poles
 after only 15 years, was also planted 
 but late frosts and dry soil inhibit  
 its growth and it is gradually being  
 replaced by Corsican Pine, which grows
 well in less fertile areas,and Douglas
 Fir. The timber is used for{pulp}and  
{box making.}The only broadleaved tree 
 to be planted is Beech. Started c.1940
 it is not yet mature but is in demand 
 for{furniture.}Some older Oaks are    
 growing from coppiced stumps but are  
 only good for{posts}and{stakes}Bark is
 sent to a{tanner}in St.Ives, Brushwood
 supplies the{floristry}trade and Larch
 is sold to the{fencing}industry.A very
 minor source of income is the sale of 
{venison}when deer are culled.         </content>
