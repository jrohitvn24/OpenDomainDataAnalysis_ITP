		<title>07GRAVEL PITS, RADLEY</title>
		<content>   These, now disused, gravel  pits are
 owned  by  the  Central  Electricity  
 Generating  Board.  They  are  being  
 filled in with flyash from the  Didcot
 powerstations.  Flyash  is  used  for 
 motorway  construction  but  there  is
 excess due to insufficient demand. The
 flyash is mixed into a  solution  with
 water and pumped into the  pits  where
 it sinks to the bottom.  Unfortunately
 this has  produced  a pollution hazard
 for the wildlife which includes herons
 ducks, geese and fish.                
                                       
   The project  should  be completed in
 about twenty  years when the reclaimed
 land  will  be  used  for  housing and
 agriculture.                          
                                       
   Security is  high, the  entire  area
 being  protected  by a high  perimeter
 fence.                                </content>
