		<title>14LOCAL HISTORY  TOWN HALL</title>
		<content> 6OO yrs ago there was a meat market   
 where the town hall is now.In 1763    
 Thomas Lord Holmes rebuilt the Town   
 hall.There are some Royal Charters in 
 the upper room.Charles 11 gave us a   
 silver gilt mace because we were      
 loyal to Charles 1. Upstairs there    
 is a meeting room where the town      
 council hold meetings,and they still  
 have meetings there. They used the    
 Town Seal to represent Yarmouth on    
 letters.On St James's Day they stick  
 a pole out of the window with a gloved
 hand on the end.This prevents you     
 being punished if you drink too       
 much.On Thursdays it is used as a fish
 market,and it is used by the Womens   
 Institute as a market on Wednesdays   
 in summer.
