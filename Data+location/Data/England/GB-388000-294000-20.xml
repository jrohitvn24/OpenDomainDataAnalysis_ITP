		<title>20CLubs Penn Scout Troup</title>
		<content>The scout troup I go to meets on a     
Thursday night near Warstones School.  
We wear a green beret, jeans with the  
scout belt, a green shirt with all the 
badges we have earned on and a green   
and blue neckerchief. Behind the two   
huts is a stretch of grass with some   
trees in which is a rope swing. We play
a lot of games with the leaders        
including football, ship wreck,        
Colditz, quarters and ball over a      
chair. Sometimes we have to do scout   
training which involves making a       
stretcher and carrying the patrol      
leader, tying knots in ropes and making
fireman's chairs and hauling people up 
to the beams.                          
Every so often we have trips to places 
like Telford Ice Rink. Also we have    
jumble sales where the leaders, our    
parents and us try to raise money for  
our troup.                             </content>
