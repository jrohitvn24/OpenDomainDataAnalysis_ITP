		<title>04Parish Magazine Of Hanley's</title>
		<content>   The magazine is self-financing and  
 retails at 5p.a month (ther are 12    
 issues a year).The cost of the covers 
 is financed by those local enterprises
 who advertise on 3 of the 4 sides,and 
 the front cover at present features   
 three symbols of the village-a pelica 
 ,the Lechmere family crest,for Hanley 
 Castle,a swan for Hanley Swan,and a   
 cockle shell for Welland (the symbol  
 of St.James of Compostella to whom    
 their church is dedicated).The        
 committee meet monthly to discuss the 
 magazine's content,after which the    
 editor assembles the material.This is 
 typed out,voluntarily on A5 paper and 
 then collated together with any       
 illustrations,by the editor so that it
 may be transfered onto carbon stencils
 cut by an electronic rotary scanner;  
 the stencils are then duplicated on an
 electric duplicator.                  </content>
