 ______________                        
 The Guides from Pytchley must join    
 with groups from Orlingbury or        
 Kettering.My{group}meets at Orlingbury
 Village hall on Tuesdays at 7.30.p.m. 
 Our leader is Mrs. Cook.  When we are 
 ready we put up our hands and are     
 quiet.  We go to our corners and line 
 up, collect our subs and give it in.  
 We then form a horseshoe, sing the    
 song and then play a game.  We then   
 learn about the badge we are trying to
 get.  In the winter, the older girls  
 make hot drinks for us to buy.        
                                       
 At the end of the{meeting,}we gather  
 in a circle, sing the leaving song and
 are then dismissed.                   
                                       
 We go home at about a quarter to nine.
