		<content>{All Saints Church}is more than        
 150 years old and lies by the River   
 Thames. It costs thirty three thousand
 pounds a year to keep open. On average
 it has fifteen services a week - six  
 on Sundays. For Parish Communions it  
 has a congregation of 270 people.     
 Before the Church was built, the old  
 Church dating back to Norman times,   
 was completely flooded one December   
 day with the worshippers still inside!
 150 years ago when the Church was     
 being built a man fell off the spire  
 and fell 50 metres to the ground and  
 escaped with just cuts and bruises.   
 The Church has 8 bells in the tower   
 which are known by their numbers. On  
 the 150th anniversary of the Church,  
 the two church schools,{Holy Trinity  
 and{Sandygate}dressed up in Victorian 
 costumes, paraded through the town and
 had a picnic in Higginson Park.       </content>
