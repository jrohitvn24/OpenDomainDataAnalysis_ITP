		<title>13OCCUPATIONS AROUND CATTERICK</title>
		<content> The area boasts of only one shop      
 dealing with arts and crafts. The     
 emphasis being on paintings done by   
 local artists. However, crafts in     
 abundance can be found in many homes. 
 Knitting, Crochet, Sewing, Tatting,   
 Quilting, Tailoring, Flower Arranging,
 Metal Work, Woodwork, Leather work and
 Hand carving. Most of these crafts    
 are taught at evening institutes held 
 in village halls and local schools.   
 The tutors of these classes are paid  
 by the local education authority and  
 must have gained the necassary        
 qualifications. Anyone can hire a     
 village hall and run a class of their 
 choice and indeed such classes are    
 popular. The most popular pastime is  
 painting, the beauty of the area      
 inspiring both local artists and      
 visitors to indulge in their hobby.
