		<title>051,st Hayle Scout Troup</title>
		<content> The 1,st Hayle Scout Troup was founded
 in 1912,it has four patrols,three     
 leaders and twenty-eight members.The  
 names of the patrols are Kestral,Eagle
 Falcon and Woodpecker.Each patrol has 
 a leader and seven or more scouts.    
 We have two camps every summer,       
 one District (a week-end camp)and one 
 Troup camp that lasts for a week.We   
 meet on Monday nights from 2O:OO      
 -21:3O hours.We first have Flag Break.
 Flag Break is when the Union Jack has 
 been tied up in a length of rope and  
 a scout is picked to pull the end of  
 the rope and make the flag unravel.   
 Then we go to the park or somewhere   
 else to play games if it's dry,if not 
 we play indoor games.To become a Scout
 you have to attend two meetings and   
 one activity.The uniform is like the  
 army only it has a scarf and woggle.
