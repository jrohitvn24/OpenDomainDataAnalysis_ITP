		<content>  At{Danesborough Fort}when the Danish 
 invaders carried off the local women  
 from villages nearby, all the menfolk 
 stormed the fort to rescue them. The  
 women took pity on a little Danish boy
 and hid him. His Ghost still walks    
 through the fort today whistling.     
{ Wordsworth,}according to local       
 hearsay, wrote his poem, the "Danish  
 Boy" after hearing this tale on one of
 his visits to Somerset.               
{ Footsteps}have been heard upstairs in
 the Carew Arms.                       
  No hounds will enter Spinney House   
 on Hurley Farm.                       
{ Superstitions}include, ill luck from 
 some flowers, actions, colours, birds 
 and animals.                          
{ Successful gardening}some believe is 
 dependant upon the church calendar and
 phases of the moon.
