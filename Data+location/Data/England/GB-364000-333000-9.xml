		<content> Tigers is a football club that was    
 started ten years ago by four lads who
 placed an advert in the local paper   
 asking for fixtures.This has grown    
 into a club with 7 teams that range   
 from under 11 yrs to under 18 yrs.All 
 the teams play in green and white but 
 have different patterns.They play in  
 the Shrewsbury Leagues and the        
 Oakengates Leagues.They use pitches at
 Palethorpes factory and M.D.Junior    
 School.They raise funds for themselves
 and are also sponsored by local firms 
 and organisations.They also raise     
 money for local charities .This year  
 they raised Â£600.They have an annual  
 presentation night  when many awards  
 are won.This year the founding four   
 boys made the presentations.
