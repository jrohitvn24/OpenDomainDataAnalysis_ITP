		<content>  Every person in our class took home a
 sheet containing questions about their
 homes. When they were returned we made
 a chart about them and this is what we
 found:             {                  
{               Walls }                
  We discovered that brick is the most 
 popular building material used for our
 houses. There are 18 brick houses and 
 2 that aren't.                        
               {Roofs}                 
  There were 13 tiled roofs, 6 slate   
 roofs and 1 thatched. We weren't very 
 surprised because tiles and slate are 
 more modern.                          
               {Built}                 
  There were 9 of our houses built in  
 the 20th century, 4 in the 19th       
 century and 2 in the 18th century.    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
