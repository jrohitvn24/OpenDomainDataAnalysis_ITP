   One great uniting factor in many    
 small villages is the church.Mathon   
 church has the same vicar as          
 neighbouring villages Cradley and     
 Storidge which further unites this    
 rural area.The main method of passing 
 information is by the church news     
 letter.Other methods are by bill      
 boards and more importantly by word of
 mouth.Strangely,in rural areas where  
 homes are far apart,news spreads very 
 quickly from person to person.This is 
 not due to nosyness or a tendency to  
 gosip, but because of shear necessity.
 Often the only reliable way to get    
 information from one place to another 
 is by word of mouth;especially when   
 conditions are bad,for instance,in    
 times of flood or snow.
