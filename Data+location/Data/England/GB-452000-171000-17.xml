		<title>17RELIGION IN FRILSHAM</title>
		<content> The beautiful Saxon Church at Frilsham
 is dedicated to St Frideswide. It was 
 built in 1150 on the site of a Roman  
 temple. Its circular graveyard is     
 associated with heathen worship. The  
 chancel was added in the 15th century.
 Frilsham is part of the{Hermitage team
{of churches,}five villages under the  
 care of three clergy. A dwindling     
 number of clergy has meant more lay   
 participation in church services. The 
 Alternative Service Book of 1982 is   
 used.{The numbers attending are good. 
 There is a choir. St Frideswide was   
 famed for healing the blind. Inspired 
 by her a ministry of healing has been 
 established at Frilsham using water   
 from a well blessed by the Saint,     
 healing mind and body. St Mary's      
 Church at Marlston uses the Book of   
 Common Prayer.{R/Catholics}go to Douai
