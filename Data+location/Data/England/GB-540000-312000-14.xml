		<title>14SHIRE HORSES IN GOREFIELD</title>
		<content> Wednesday 17th July was a very        
 successful day for{Mr. Graham Ward}of 
{Decoy Farm, Gorefield.}After suffering
 from a knee injury the previous       
 evening he recovered well enough to   
 lead one of his mares into the ring at
 the{East of England Show}held at      
 Peterborough. The Judges were very    
 impressed by the 9 year old bay mare  
 which collected the{Champion Shire    
{Horse}title. The horse which last won 
 the championship in 1979 has since    
 taken several major titles and is     
 being tipped for further success at   
 the Horse of the Year Show in October.
 Decoy Royal Surprise won the class for
 a barren mare or filly aged 3 and     
 over, and went on to take the FW      
 Griffin Challenge Cup and the GT Ward 
 Memorial Cup for the best shire female
 as well as clinching the championship.
