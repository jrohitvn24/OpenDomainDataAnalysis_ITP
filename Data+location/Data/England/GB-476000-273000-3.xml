		<title>03Faxton Grange Farm,Old</title>
		<content>  The farm is about 340 acres.The      
 weather this year has affected the    
 crops badly.The very wet and cold     
 spring has delayed harvesting by about
 3 weeks and produced more mildew on   
 the corn than normal.                 
                                       
  The soil is heavy clay but reasonably
 fertile.Nitrogen fertilisers are used 
 in the Spring and Phosphates and      
 Potash in the Winter.This is very     
 expensive.                            
                                       
  The burning of straw is a problem as 
 the fields are small and setting      
 hedges on fire is a hazard.They have  
 tried compressing the straw into small
 brick sized pieces {(brickets)}to burn
 in a wood burning stove,but this was  
 not very successful,as they did not   
 burn well enough.
