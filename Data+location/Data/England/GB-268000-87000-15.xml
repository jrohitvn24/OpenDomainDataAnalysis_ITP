		<title>15LOCAL HISTORY OF CHAGFORD</title>
		<content> Chagford is a{Saxon}name, originally  
 spelt as{Kagefort. }It meant{Gorse    
{Ford,}and Chagford was the gorse spot 
 where the River Teign could be forded.
 It receives a mention in the{Domesday 
{Book}which states that "Chageford was 
 held by Dodo in the time of King      
 Edward". {Tin}was extracted from Dart-
 moor from around 1150 onwards and in  
 1305 Edward granted Chagford a charter
 enabling it to hold{Stannary Courts   
 and to check on the tin's quality.    
 During the{Civil War}Chagford was     
 decidedly{Royalist}and in a skirmish  
 outside the Three Crowns Hotel a young
 Cornish poet,{Sydney Godolphin,}was   
 shot and killed.  In the early 1800's 
 woollen mills on the banks of the     
 Teign became very prominent and one of
 these was used to bring{electric      
{street lighting}in 1891 to Chagford,  
 the first place west of London.       </content>
