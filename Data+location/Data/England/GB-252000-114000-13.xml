		<title>13MAKING SILAGE AT BEAFORD</title>
		<content>   On 17th. June we watched silage     
 being made at North Harepath Farm.    
 The farmer was driving a powerful     
 tractor. A trailer and a silage       
 machine was hitched onto the tractor. 
 As the tractor pulls these over the   
 field, the silager mows the grass,    
 gathers it up and chops it into small 
 pieces. The grass is then air-blown   
 into the trailer. When the trailer is 
 full, it is replaced by another, with 
 a second tractor taking the full      
 trailer to the silage barn. In the    
 barn the grass is emptied out and     
 rolled hard to compress it.  The      
 finished silage is covered with a     
 large plastic sheet.                  
   Silage is used for feeding animals  
 during the winter months. It is       
 quicker and easier to make and store  
 than hay, so has now become the main  
 fodder crop made from grassland.      </content>
