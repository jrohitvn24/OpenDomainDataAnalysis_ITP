		<content> P C Caton is our village policeman.   
 He does not have as many crimes to    
 deal with in our village as he does in
 Epping, the next town along..There are
 40 to 50 other policemen living in the
 village who keep their eyes open.  If 
 people in the village see a suspicious
 person, they phone P C Caton and lock 
 their windows and doors.  90%         
 co-operate.  You have to be 5ft 8 and 
 not colour blind to be a policeman.   
 He has been in the village 6 years and
 the last 3 years have changed for     
 him.  The Airfield has taken a lot of 
 his time.  People have to have        
 certificates to say that they own a   
 rifle gun and belong to a club.  The  
 village is not as nice as it used to  
 be because there are more bad people.
