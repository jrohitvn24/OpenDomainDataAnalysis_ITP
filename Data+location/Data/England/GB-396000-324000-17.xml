		<content>  Through this area the main line of   
communication is the A51 road,which was
once a main route from London to       
Chester and the north.In order to      
estimate its significance,a traffic    
flow survey was undertaken.            
  From the results the number of       
vehicles using the road between 13.00  
and 14.45 hours,indicated a high       
percentage of business and commercial  
usage.This included heavy goods lorries
hauling a wide variety of products and 
many vans supplying local industries   
and residents.                         
  In terms of percentage the survey    
found that 35% of traffic was of       
industrial nature and 65% were private 
cars.However it can also be surmised   
that many of the cars were perhaps     
people involved in their day to day    
work.For example,sales people.
