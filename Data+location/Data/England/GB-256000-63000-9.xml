 A. Bronze Age remains are scattered on
 either side of the Plm valley. They   
 include numerous hut circles, some in 
 groups surrounded by pounds.Also a    
 number of cairns, two stone rows, a   
 standing stone and a large stone      
 circle.                               
 B.Ancient reeves or boundary banks are
 of unknown period but often occur near
 Bronze Age settlements.               
 C.A re-erected way cross by the side  
 of the road is one of a large number  
 erected in medieval times to mark     
 routes across the moor, particularly  
 linking monastries.                   
 D.Stone quarrying used to take place  
 at Trowlesworthy Tor where the pink   
 granite was especially desirable.     
 E. The vermin trap on Legis Tor is a  
 reminder of when rabbits were a       
 valuable food source.                 </content>
