		<title>15A DAY IN MY LIFE -1</title>
		<content> August Bank Holiday, 1985. Today I am 
 staying at home with my husband,      
 Brian, daughter Claire and my niece,  
 who is staying to play with Claire. My
 son David has gone to stay with his   
 grandparents.  Brian is a self-       
 employed electrician and will be doing
 office work most of today. Claire and 
 her cousin are playing outside with   
 other children from the village.      
 After lunch I did some gardening, cut 
 the grass and trimmed the hedges in   
 our front garden. David rang up to say
 he was going over the Humber Bridge   
 with his grandparents. I was pleased  
 the weather was so good, as so often  
 this year it has been very wet. The   
 girls came in late after looking at   
 some new puppies next door. I packed  
 up Brian's lunch for the next day and 
 went to bed after watching a film on  
 the television.   by{MRS ANITA HUNTER </content>
