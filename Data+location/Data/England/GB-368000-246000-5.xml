		<title>05Soil Erosion at Cradley Hall</title>
		<content>   At Cradley Hall farm there is soil  
 erosion in all three hopyards.  The   
 hops are grown on steep slopes (up to 
 1 in 6) and the yards are kept weed   
 free.  The soils (Bromyard loams) are 
 a mixture of{clay}and{silt}and the use
 of tractors between the permanent rows
 has led to a breakdown of the{soil    
{structure.} Silt is washed away and a 
 capping of clay left.  The ruts left  
 by tractor wheels channel run off.    
   This winter Mr. Price hired a       
 contractor to dig a trench across one 
 yard and fill with 3-6" smooth        
 pebbles: this helps{drainage.}        
   Although it is proving successful,  
 it is hard to maintain as the pebbles 
 quickly get covered with clay from    
 tractor wheels.  Despite this Mr.Price
 is planning to do the same in his     
 other yards.
