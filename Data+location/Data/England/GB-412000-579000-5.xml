		<title>05PUBLIC TRANSPORT IN WHALTON</title>
		<content> Compared with many rural communities  
 Whalton is lucky in that it has a     
 regular,if infrequent, bus service.   
 There are three services which run    
 during the week but none on Sunday.   
 From Whalton it is possible to get to 
 Newcastle (3 buses a day), Ponteland  
 (6 buses a day), Morpeth (5 buses a   
 day) and Hexham (8 buses a week). The 
 last bus comes through the village at 
 6.30pm so that people without cars    
 cannot visit say the cinema in Morpeth
 unless they are fit enough to walk or 
 rich enough to hire a taxi. Parents of
 teenagers too young to drive find     
 themselves running a taxi service to  
 and from the local towns so that their
 children can participate in activities
 such as Girl Guides, Young Farmers    
 etc.
