		<content> The disused  railway station  and old 
 marshalling  yards  separate  Silloth 
 from   West  Silloth.     The  latter 
 comprises 2 garages, 1 pub,3 shops, 1 
 church and about 200 houses,  most of 
 which are on a council housing estate 
 called{ The Crofts.} Some new council 
 houses are being built nearby.        
{Skinburness}is about 2 miles north of 
 Silloth.  Skinburness  Road  consists 
 mainly of detached houses  with a sea 
 view; there are about 85 houses up to 
 the half-way point,{East Cote. }There 
 is an  ex-M.O.D. housing estate of 60 
 houses called  Skinburness Drive just 
 outside  Silloth,   and  two  smaller 
 estates at Skinburness Village itself 
 along with an hotel and a shop.
