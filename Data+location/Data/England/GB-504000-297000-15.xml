		<title>15WANSFORD RIVER BRIDGE</title>
		<content>  The river bridge at Wansford is a    
 large, impressive structure with ten  
 arches which span the river and the   
 flood plain. Prior to the sixteenth   
 century the bridge had been made of   
 wood, but in 1571 a storm caused the  
 river to flood the village and it     
 caused so much damage to the bridge   
 that it was decided to build a new    
 one. Local stone from Toll Bar Spinney
 was used in the construction, but due 
 to a mediaeval industrial dispute, the
 job was not completed until 1577 and  
 this date can still be seen carved on 
 the stonework.                        
  Today the bridge no longer carries   
 all the traffic of the former Great   
 North Road, instead it serves only    
 local traffic and is not wide enough  
 to allow traffic to pass, so at busy  
 times queues form on both sides of    
 the bridge.                           </content>
