		<title>16 PENHILL FARM - CALNE</title>
		<content> Mr. Bell was trained at Lackham       
 College because he was interested in  
 sheep. He saw some demonstrations of  
 sheep milking in a farm in Dorset and 
 thought it would be good to try it at 
 his farm. His father agreed to let him
 try.He started with 32 Friesland sheep
 in the autumn of 1982. Friesland sheep
 were chosen because this breed has    
 high milk yield and also a fine       
 fleece which makes very good soft     
 wool.There has been a lot of research 
 done at Great Ormond Street Hospital  
 into the benefits of sheep milk for   
 babies.It is high in proteins. It is  
 also good for people who have         
 allergies or asthma.It tastes very    
 good.Milk from the sheep is collected 
 in the same way as from cows except   
 that the machine is smaller and       
 quicker,a cow sucks 60 times a minute 
 a sheep 120 .                         </content>
