		<content> We often play{Forty-Forty}at playtime.
 Part of a wall is chosen as "a        
 post".Someone with his eyes covered   
 stands there to count to 44 while     
 others hide.Then he looks for them.   
 When he sees someone he says "40-40   
 See" and he names the person seen.Then
 he runs to touch the post before that 
 person does.If the person named gets  
 there first he says"40-40,home".This  
 continues till all the people have    
 been seen.If the last person arrives  
 before the catcher he says "40-40 save
 all",and the game starts again with   
 the original catcher.                 
{Sticky Glue.}One person chases.Those  
 touched stand with legs astride.      
 Another person has to go through their
 legs to free them.If the chaser       
 catches everyone,the first one caught 
 takes over chasing.A variation of this
 has the chaser as a witch.            </content>
