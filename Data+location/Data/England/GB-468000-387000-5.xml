 Football Club was formed in 1978 after
 a period of 25 years where there was  
 no village team. After a very poor    
 start in the 1978/9 season they       
 finished in the lower half of Division
 Three of the Retford and District     
 Sunday Football League. The following 
 season promotion was won to Division  
 Two of that League. In 1983/4 a second
 team was formed which finished midway 
 up Division Three whilst the 'A' Team 
 won Division Two. Unfortunately the   
 'A' team broke up at the end of the   
 season but the other team have gained 
 promotion to Division Two of the      
 Retford League. The ground is owned by
 the Council but is for the "use of the
 village". The football club maintains 
 the ground which has been developed   
 from rough ground.
