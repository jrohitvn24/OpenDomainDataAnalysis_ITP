		<title>20A new flyover at Hanford.</title>
		<content>  My school is on the busy Hanford     
Roundabout and every morning the       
traffic on the link road from the M6 is
held up.They have decided to build a   
flyover but this will effect our       
school.First we will lose half our     
Football pitch next to the school.The  
Traffic will be much closer making it  
noisier with more vibrations from the  
heavy lorries that travel from the M6  
to the city centre.Some tall trees will
have to be knocked down which look     
pretty and sheild us from the noise and
the traffic.I think the view will be   
spoiled and distract us.We will see the
traffic going by our school along the  
flover.
