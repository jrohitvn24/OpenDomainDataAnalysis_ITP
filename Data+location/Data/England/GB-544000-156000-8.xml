		<title>08The Vegetation of Knockholt</title>
		<content> The varied soils show a wide variety  
 of vegetation. The chalk scarp slope  
 and clay dip slopes showing marked    
 differences. On the chalk the woodland
 is predominately beech with yew, holly
 cherry, whitebeam and some oaks. In   
 Autumn traveller's joy is noticeable. 
 On the clay the woods are mostly oak  
 with ash, hawthorn, field maple and   
 many others in thickets with dense    
 undergrowth and bracken, honeysuckle  
 and wild roses in the hedgerows. In   
 Spring bluebells and primroses  are   
 very common, though the ploughing of  
 old pastures has greatly reduced the  
 range of flowers to be seen. Orchids, 
 violets, harebells and cowslips can be
 found and recently himalayan balsam.  
 Blackberries, elderberries and sloes  
 are gathered in the Autumn.The height 
 of the area means that Spring flowers 
 are later than in neighbouring areas. </content>
