		<title>16MY MUM IS A NIGHT SISTER</title>
		<content>My mum works at Bretby Orthopaedic     
Hospial near Burton. She leaves home   
at 19.45 and begins work at 20.15.     
She works on various wards,tidying     
beds,taking blood pressures,           
temperatures and pulses,filling in the 
bed state,dealing with bedpans and also
doing office work. Sometimes she is    
completely in charge of a ward. Bretby 
hospital has 84 beds. It deals with    
knee or hip replacement,joint surgery, 
foot and cartilage operations   and    
convalescence.There is a special air   
filter round the operating table which 
ensures that the air is sterile.       
The doctors and nurses have to wear    
special suits-they look like space     
suits-cutting out any risk of          
breathing germs over the patients.     
There are Physio and Occupational      
Therapy departments.
