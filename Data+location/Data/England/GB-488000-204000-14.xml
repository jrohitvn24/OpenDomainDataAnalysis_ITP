		<title>14Leisure Activity in The Lee</title>
		<content>{Riding}is one of the most popular     
 local activities. A large number of   
 young people belong to The Pony Club, 
 which organises days for instruction &amp;
 practice. The Old Berkley Hunt meets  
 in the area twice during the season, &amp;
 many adults ride for leisure all year.
 2 places keep horses at livery, &amp;     
 there are many in private keeping.    
 Being part of an A.O.N.B., the area   
 is used a lot by{walkers.}The many    
 footpaths are well-marked by the      
 Chiltern Society; but unfortunately   
 riders make some footpaths impassable 
 to walkers at some seasons. The woods,
 owned by the Manor Estate, are used   
 for pheasant{shooting,}managed by a   
 syndicate of residents &amp; farmers. Grey
 squirrels &amp; pigeons are also shot as  
 they are pests. There is a{Cricket    
{Club,}1 tennis court for hire, &amp; a few
 private courts &amp; swimming pools.      </content>
