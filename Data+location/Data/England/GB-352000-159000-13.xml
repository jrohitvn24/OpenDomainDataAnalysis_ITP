		<title>13Water - The Yeo Reservoir</title>
		<content> In order to provide water for the     
 thirsty towns of Bristol and Bath, and
 the surrounding countryside, it was   
 decided to capture the water flowing  
 from the River Yeo and various springs
 in the Mendip Hills in the valley     
 below Blagdon to form the Yeo         
 Reservoir. Some of the villages in the
 area have benefitted considerably from
 this scheme - not only does the lake  
 add greatly to the beauty of the      
 valley but in order to safeguard the  
 purity of the water the villages of   
 Butcombe, Compton Martin and Blagdon  
 had all to be provided with sewers and
 sewage-disposal works, which other    
 less fortunate areas still lack in    
 1985! There is an intersting obelisk  
 on the hill above Chew Stoke which is 
 in fact an air ventilation shaft for  
 the water pipe which runs from Chewton
 Mendip to Bristol.                    </content>
