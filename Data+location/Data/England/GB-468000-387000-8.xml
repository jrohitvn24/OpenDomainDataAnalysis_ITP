		<title>08Chapel House</title>
		<content> Grade II listed, traditional brick    
 built cottage; onetime farmhouse      
 (built sideways on to the road).      
 Front part of house c.1800, back      
 c.1820 and definately prior to 1840.  
 Present owners: Mr &amp; Mrs Ruff.        
 Purchased in original state (including
 tiled floors, ranges, pork curing room
 no bathroom or toilet) in April 1984. 
 Sale was possible after the death of  
 the tenant Jim Collishaw (bachelor,   
 one-time famous "scytheman") in Feb.  
 1983 at 82 years. He had lived there  
 since at least 1941 at a peppercorn   
 rent of 7s.6d (37\p) fixed by agree-  
 ment. No proper repairs or alterations
 had been affected in this time. The   
 tenants from 1908-1926 worked for the 
 Duke of Portland. Remains of a        
 washhouse were found next to the house
 and a dry well in the garden.
