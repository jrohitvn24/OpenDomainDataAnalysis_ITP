		<title>03Trade in the area</title>
		<content> In all four villages covered in this  
 survey there isn't 1 shop or inn,but  
 Shelton has a post office but this    
 doesn't deal with trade in other way. 
 Therefore all trade in the area is    
 brought in by travelling tradesMEN.   
 These are mainly food merchants who   
 bring meat,veg.,milk,bread etc.       
 Newspapers are brought in from outside
 the area but residents have to travel 
 to buy general supplies and furnishing
 etc.The main shopping areas are Newark
 Notttingham,Bingham and Grantham.Quite
 alot of residents grow there own fruit
 and vegetables and a few farmers raise
 their own meat stock.Shopping is      
 mainly done once a week and so fridges
 and freezers are used alot.Door to    
 door salesman are a thing of the past 
 because of high travel costs.Gypsies  
 venders occasionly pass through with  
 trade.                                </content>
