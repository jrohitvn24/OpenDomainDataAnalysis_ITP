 well used and there are play areas for
 small children. Southwick has 2       
 cricket and 3 football teams; Rode has
 a cricket team. The village schools   
 use the fields for games. There is a

 by volunteers and financed by village 
 efforts. It is used by the Band,      
 Brownies and evening classes. The

 only used for changing; refreshments  
 are provided at the village hall on   
 the same site. Functions, flower shows
 fetes and car boot sales are held on  
 the fields. Local pubs have darts and
