		<title>10GOOLE RAIL LINK WITH HULL</title>
		<content>  The{railway}line to Hull was under   
 threat of{closure}because a bridge    
 over the River Ouse, built in 1868,   
 was in need of immediate repair with  
 an estimated cost of Â£2.2 million.    
 Much of the{damage}was being caused by
 shipping on the river.                
  Local people were very angry at this 
 and the Goole and District Rail Action
 Group was formed to fight the closure.
  After many months of{negotiations}it 
 was announced in January 1985 that a  
 deal had been agreed with British Rail
 and Humberside County Council. The    
 Council would pay Â£800,000 towards the
 repair and it meant that the bridge   
 would{stay open}for at least another  
 10 years.                             
  In the same week that this was       
 announced, the bridge was once again  
 struck by a ship.
