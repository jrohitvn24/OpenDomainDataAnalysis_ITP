		<title>16Grantully Castle  Page 2</title>
		<content> The castle is about 35m high including
 the turrets.It is 5 stories high and  
 the walls are about 2m thick at the   
 bottom.The biggest room in the castle 
 is the drawing room and the biggest   
 room in the oldest part is the Hall.  
 Only three very famous people have    
 stayed in the castle. The first was   
{General Monk,he}came in 1654.Nobody   
 else famous came to stay till just    
 before the last war when the{Duke and 
{Duchess of York,our}present{Queen     
{Mother,came}to stay for two weeks     
 after they got married.               
 Not all the castle is used.There are  
 lots of bedrooms upstairs which are   
 only used when lots of people come,but
 they try to use most of it to keeo the
 air fresh.                            
 We found Grantully Castle a very      
 interesting building.
