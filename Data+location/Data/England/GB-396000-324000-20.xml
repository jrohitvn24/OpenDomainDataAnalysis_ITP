		<content>  B.D.Fuels have been on the Hixon     
Industrial Estate for 7 years.The      
initials B.D.stand for the names of the
two directors,Barker and Davies.They   
chose Hixon because it was convenient  
to the Stafford area.They have no more 
depots in the country.B.D.Fuels have 4 
tankers(each having the capacity of    
2500 gallons)and 12 men.               
  They supply both the domestic and    
commercial sectors;and deliver in a    
30 mile radius.They tend to sell more  
oil in the winter months.              
  B.D.Fuels have an excellent safety   
record.                                
  The oil is purchased from Texaco.It  
is refined in Pembroke and they        
transport it via a pipeline to the     
Kingsbury terminal near Birmingham.From
here it is taken to Hixon.
