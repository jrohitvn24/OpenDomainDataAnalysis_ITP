		<title>12WYVERN BARRACKS</title>
		<content>  Wyvern Barracks is situated on a site
 rising on a slope from south to north.
 From south-north the area consists of 
 parade ground,museum,and              
 administration blocks.Servicemen's    
 quarters are adjacent to football and 
 cricket pitches;also a tennis court.  
 The north-east corner is being        
 developed for the Inland Revenue.     
  For the last decade the barracks have
 not housed a regiment of soldiers.It  
 is hoped a new regiment will shortly  
 join the 43 Brigade and accommadate   
 the sevices already there.            
  The barracks has facilities for      
 helicopters to land and is used for   
 accident emergencies and by visiting  
 dignatories,eg.The Royal Family.
