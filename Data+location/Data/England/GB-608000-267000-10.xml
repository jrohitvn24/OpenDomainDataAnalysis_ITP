		<title>10A DAY IN THE LIFE OF SIMON</title>
		<content>     I am ten year's old. My day       
starts at 7.30 am. My first task is to 
make my packed lunch  for school . In  
my packed lunch I have wholemeal bread 
ham sandwiches , a kit kat, an apple   
and a packet of salt and vinegar       
crisps .                               
     I go and have breakfast, either   
corflakes or Readybrek.I leave for     
school at 8.18 a.m. I travel to school 
by bus arriving at 8.30. The school    
caretaker looks after us until 9.00.   
My favourite subjects are SMP maths,   
these are workcards, and art.My        
favorite break time activities are     
corner-crash or football.My hobbies    
are electronics and rounders.          
     I like living here because I have 
lots of friends.There is the Grimmer   
where I can go fishing and I can go to 
the village shop and buy sweets.
