		<content>   We know that Mr. Farnsworth thinks  
 that wildlife and wild flowers are    
 important, so we asked him how he     
 looked after these. He said that "good
 farmers believed in conservation of   
 wildlife". He does not spray any of   
 his crops when the bees are gathering 
 pollen. Also he does not spray "unless
 it is absolutely necessary", he said. 
 "Hedgerows are also very important",  
 said Mr. Farnsworth, "so they should  
 not be sprayed at all".               
   We also found out that Mr.          
 Farnsworth has built a lake on his    
 farm which is a nature reserve for    
 wildlife, and that he does not allow  
 shooting on any part of his land.     
   Mr. Farnsworth answered lots of our 
 questions and we think that he is an  
 example of a good farmer. We are not  
 so sure that all the farmers around   
 here are as good as him though.       </content>
