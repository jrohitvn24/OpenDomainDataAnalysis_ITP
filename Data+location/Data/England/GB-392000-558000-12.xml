		<content>{Mr Charlton,}or Anty as he is better  
 known,has been a 'Shire postman now   
 for{37 years.}His day starts at{6.15, 
 when he goes to Hexham to collect     
 the mail and sorts it ready for       
 delivery.He covers the{Steel}postal   
 area-in fact,Steel Post Office is one 
 room in his house, and his wife is    
 postmistress!For the first 20 years,he
 did his round on foot or bicycle. He  
 says his most exciting day was when he
 first got a post van.He visits way-out
 farms-at one there are 4 gates to open
 and close- and he very much enjoys his
 life. He lends a hand with all sorts  
 of things on his rounds, a difficult  
 lambing, digging people out of        
 snowdrifts, and helping the elderly,  
 and he is a welcome arrival           
 everywhere.Sometimes he has been      
 chased by bulls or tups,amusing       
 afterwards but not at the time!       </content>
