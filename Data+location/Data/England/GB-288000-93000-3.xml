		<title>03GUIDE DOGS TRAINING CENTRE</title>
		<content>  {Cleve House}in Exwick houses one of 
 the{training centres}for the{Guide    
{Dogs for the Blind Association.}There 
 are 119 dogs in 54 kennels. They are  
 mainly{Labradors,}and they eat a tin  
 of dogmeat each per day. Most of them 
 are bred by the Association. About 80%
 pass the test, and the others go to   
 good homes.                           
                                       
  {65 people}work at the centre, and 23
 of them are trainers. They wear a     
 uniform and protective clothing when  
 they are with the dogs. It takes 15-16
 months to train a dog, and one month  
 to train a blind person with his dog, 
 using the special harness.            
                                       
   The association gets its{money}from 
 public donations and legacies.        
                                       
                                       </content>
