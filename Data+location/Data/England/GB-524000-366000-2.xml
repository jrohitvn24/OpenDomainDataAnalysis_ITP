		<content> Norflex was established in 1972. The  
 factory in Horncastle was established 
 in 1979. There are 3 other factories  
 in Cramlington, Ebbw Vale and Dolstone
 They make land and road drainage pipes
 in 7 sizes, 80mm being the most       
 common. The factory employs 31 people 
 and supplies are sent all over the    
 British Isles. There are 2 women in   
 the office. The rest work in the      
 factory in 3 shifts. In fixed assets  
 the equipment is worth around Â£2      
 million. A roll takes about 5 minutes 
 to make depending upon the size of the
 piping. 430 rolls a day are made for  
 the 80mm size. The Horncastle building
 is 15000sq ft. In 1984 the turnover   
 was Â£5 million in all 3               
 establishments. In each batch of      
 drainage pipes there is no waste.
