		<content> A relatively undeveloped block used   
 primarily for farming and tourism.    
 In the National Park &amp; including      
 Heritage Coast it is valued for its   
 scenery and unspoilt appearance.   In 
 the E then on 50-200ft high cliffs &amp;  
 steep grassy slopes (old quarries)    
 leading to a rocky shore and in north 
 west is a wide sandy beech of Runswick
 Bay overlooked by the old fishibg     
 village beyond.   Gently undulating   
 hills of farms and basin of the bay   
 some rough ground and a heavily wooded
 valley make the coastal area in       
 particular popular with tourists who  
 use the beech, and walk the Cleveland 
 way and other footpaths, sailing is   
 popular here.   Populated by many     
 small farms &amp; the small villages of   
 Goldsborough &amp; Kettleness.  Amenities 
 are few but some tourist facilities   
 are provided at nearby Runswick Bay   </content>
