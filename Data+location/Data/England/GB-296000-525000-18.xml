		<content> Being a busy industrial region the    
 area is quite well served with a good 
 transport network.There is a main road
 that runs through the area,the        
{B5296.}This is a very busy road and   
 carries alot of lorries taking        
 materials to and from the{British     
{Steel Plant}as well as the other      
 industies found on the{Derwent Howe   
 site. Most of the other roads are just
 service roads providing access to the 
 large housing estate or the industrial
 estates of the area.                  
 The main{West Cumbrian railway line   
 also passes through the area,and      
 although it is not a busy line it does
 carry both freight and passengers. It 
 follows the coastline as here is the  
 flatest land with gentle gradients.   
 There used to be many{mineral railway 
{lines}in the area serving the port of 
 Workington and the steel works.       </content>
