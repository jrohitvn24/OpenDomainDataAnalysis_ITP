		<title>01Risby to Cavenham</title>
		<content>  The block under review consists      
 largely                               
 f arable farmland,interspersed quite  
plentifully with woodland.The general  
topography is that it is at its highest
point at the Water Tower on the Risby -
Cavenham road whence it falls gently   
to a small valley where a mostly       
seasonal stream flows North to the     
River Lark.                            
           The Parish boundary between 
Risby and Cavenham follows the general 
line of this little stream in the south
of the block but leaves it to skirt    
an area known as Black Ditches.It      
rejoins the stream via the Icknield Way
and largely follows the stream to its  
confluence with the River Lark.        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
