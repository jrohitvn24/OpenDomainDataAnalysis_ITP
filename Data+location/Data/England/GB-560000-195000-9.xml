		<title>09Hutton &amp; Shenfield,a history</title>
		<content>   In 1793, the area was described as a
 populous place, with good inns chiefly
 maintained by the multitude of        
 passengers and carriers passing along 
 the Roman road from Colchester to     
 London. The great Mr.McAdam himself   
 worked on the Shenfield to Chelmsford 
 road in 1833, and now this road is    
 connected to the London Orbital M25   
 motorway. In 1843, when the Eastern   
 Counties Railway opened, people began 
 commuting the 18 miles to London,     
 where they coluld work within the     
 capital of the country but yet live in
 countryside with all of the modern    
 facilities of a town.                 
   At Hutton the Rayleigh Road from    
 Shenfield to Billericay was once known
 as Hutton Street.Here on The Mount,   
 near Shenfield, large houses were     
 built and Hutton itself supplied the  
 servants for the wealthy.             </content>
