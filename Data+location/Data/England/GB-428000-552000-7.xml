 Ayton Primary School surveyed the     
 villages of{Rickleton and Picktree:-  
   We first noticed{a club,and a chapel
 which opened on 30th August l975. We  
 crossed the road and saw some{council 
{houses and flats.}There were three    
 shops,two for{newspapers and one take-
{away.}We saw a little{park}then       
 crossed the road again to{Rickleton   
{School.}It has 340 children and a     
 nursery class.Ours will have 200      
 children when it is full but it only  
 has 86 at the moment.We walked through
 New Vigo Wood to some{architect-      
{designed houses,}one had two sheds and
 a swimming pool.They had big gardens. 
   The only old places were{Picktree   
{cottages and farm.}People who lived   
 in the cottages would have worked on  
 the farm but it is now dilapidated.   
 The cottages are still occupied.      </content>
