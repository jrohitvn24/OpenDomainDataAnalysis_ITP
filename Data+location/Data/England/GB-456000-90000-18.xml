		<content>   Seventy years ago the{Isle of Wight 
 was served by a network of small      
 branch lines which were owned by four 
 main companies. By the 1960's the     
 railways were in decline as a result  
 of competition by road transport.     
   The{last steam train}ran from       
 Shanklin to Ryde in December 1966.    
 However such was the affection for the
 old engines and carriages that a group
 of enthusiasts were determined to save
 them.{1.75 miles of track}between     
 Havenstreet and Wootton were purchased
 and in 1971{Havenstreet Station}was   
 re-opened to the public. In 1978 it   
 was recognised as a fully-fledged     
 working railway and has become an     
 important{tourist attraction.         
   The site at Havenstreet has been    
 extended to include a{railway museum  
 and works and several locomotives are 
 undergoing restoration.               </content>
