		<title>05The River Glen.</title>
		<content>      The well-known fresh-water fish  
 (roach,dace,chub,bream,perch,tench    
 and pike) abound in the Glen.  Anglers
 come from all over to tempt them.     
     The sluice marks the saltwater    
 limit of the Glen.  At the "Reservoir"
 there are fishing boats,sailing boats 
 and cruisers.  The creek is tidal and 
 can be used 1 hour before high water  
 and 3 hours afterwards.  Most boats go
 for day trips into the Wash to collect
 cockles,shrimps and samphor.          
      The creek is almost the same now 
 as it was three hundred year ago,apart
 from a new sluice up stream. The old  
 one was outside the "Ship Inn".       
      Two freshwater rivers empty into 
 the tidal Welland, the Glen and the   
 Vernats.                              
      Ducks and swans breed on the Glen
 and some feed at back doors of kindly 
 folk living nearby.    M. Jackson.    </content>
