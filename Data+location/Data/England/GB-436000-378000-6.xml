		<title>06MOSS VALLEY, THE RIVER</title>
		<content>      The River Moss is still          
 unpolluted, until it reaches the River
 Rother at Eckington. Although there is
 little plantlife growing in the       
 shallow runs there is a great         
 diversity of invertebrates and fish.  
 This is typical of a nutrient poor    
 stream and warrants its status as a   
 site of special interest.             
      A whole series of dams were made 
 to provide water power to run the     
 bellows of furnaces and turn grinding 
 wheels. These are now in various      
 states of repair. Some are used by    
 private fishing clubs from the nearby 
 large centres of population, whilst   
 in the hamlet of Birleyhay one forms  
 part of a private garden.
