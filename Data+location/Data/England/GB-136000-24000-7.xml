 husband when he was a boy of 15 or    
 16,while Kathryn,my elder daughter,   
 also sensed a man bending over her.   
 She was not able to move,and for      
 some time after that,slept with the   
 light on. "                           
 There is strong evidence that the     
 bones of a boy were,in fact,found     
 under an apple tree in the orchard and
 taken for interment in Sennen         
 Churchyard.The orchard has now gone,  
 the last tree having been blown down  
 in a gale last year.                  
 On one of our school Domesday Outings 
 we came across a small field within   
 sight of Penrose Farm.It is very over 
 grown and in the middle of it we found
 a very old apple tree.....
