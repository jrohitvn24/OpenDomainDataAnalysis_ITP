		<title>12HOUSING IN EASTLEIGH.</title>
		<content>  In Eastleigh Town Centre there are   
 mainly blocks of old terraced houses  
 which were built about 80 years ago in
 the railway "boom".As a result of the 
 Second World War some large council   
 estates were built to house homeless  
 people c 1950.In 1960-1970 the local  
 council had the idea of demolishing   
 terraced houses and replacing them    
 with blocks of flats,which still      
 exist.The idea however proved too     
 costly and was stopped.               
  General improvement grants enabled   
 house owners to modernise their old   
 terraced houses.                      
  In the early 70's large private      
 estates were built.Flats are now being
 built to house one parent families and
 single people.Eastleigh at the moment 
 is a rapidly developing area.
