		<title>01Introduction To Our Block</title>
		<content> Our Domesday block is situated in a   
 rural part of Derbyshire outside the  
 bounderies of the Peak Park. Much of  
 the area is given over to grazing for 
 sheep and cattle with some crops. A   
 large part of this area has been taken
 over by the Water Board and is due to 
 be flooded to create the Carsington   
 Reservoir.Work has been delayed by the
 discovery of a large crack in the     
 newly built dam and there is now some 
 debate as to if, or when, the         
 reservoir will be completed.There are 
 2 small villages, often thought of as 
 one, called Carsington and Hopton.The 
 population of these two villages is   
 about 200,served by a church,         
 school,shop/post-office and public    
 house.Between the 2 villages is the   
 family home of the Gells, Hopton      
 Hall, famous for its curved wall.
