		<title>10Village school - Baston</title>
		<content> The headmaster has been at the school 
 for three years and finds it the      
 friendliest he has encountered in 16  
 years of teaching.The{school}has 71   
 pupils aged between 5 and 11 years.   
 There are 3 full time teachers (as    
 well as the headmaster) and 1 part    
 time.Most of the children live in the 
 village but a few travel from         
 Greatford and West Deeping by their   
 parents choice.The discipline in the  
 school is applied only where necessary
 and often democratically-the victims  
 decide on the punishment,under        
 supervision of the headmaster.        
 Corporal punishment is never used. The
 activities in lunch and break times   
 include chess, craft, country dancing,
 drama and many forms of sport.The     
 headmaster finds that he works for two
 hours each weekday evening and about 4
 hours over weekends marking and admin.</content>
