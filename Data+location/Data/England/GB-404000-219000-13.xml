		<title>13SOUNDBOROUGH,SEVENHAMPTON</title>
		<content> Soundborough stands picturesquely in a
 fold of the hills surrounded by its   
 farm buildings and 3 cottages .The    
 estate having changed hands 6 years   
 ago in 1985 the house is undergoing   
 extensive refurbishment and           
 enlargement.It is a flourishing mixed 
 farm with 90 hectares of grass,       
 supporting nearly 85 ewes and 224     
 hectares of arable.There is also some 
 woodland for which there is a gradual 
 longterm replanting programme. On the 
 edge of the estate there is a pair of 
 cottages bought by the council to     
 avoid their becoming derelict at a    
 time when low rents made maintenance  
 uneconomic;they are now being sold to 
 their council tenants.All those living
 on the estate also work there.The     
 previous farmer is retired nearby     
 ,where his family farm a smaller      
 holding.                              </content>
