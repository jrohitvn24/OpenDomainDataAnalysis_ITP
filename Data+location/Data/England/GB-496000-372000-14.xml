		<title>14LIFE STYLE OF AN MUSLIM  BOY</title>
		<content> I live in the west part of Lincoln and
 I have a big family.  My family,      
 religion and future is the most       
 important thing in my life.  I have   
 two sisters and two brothers. Only one
 of my sisters is older than me and the
 rest are younger. We all get along    
 with each other and are quite happy.  
 The thing I hope is that we all grow  
 up together and live a happy life.    
 My religion is another important thing
 in my life. It is very important to   
 obey the religion. The religion is    
 Islam. It is very strict. You can do  
 certain things and certain things you 
 can't. You are not allowed to drink   
 alcohol, gamble or eat any pig meat,  
 but you have to fast and prayer five  
 times a day. The other thing which is 
 important is my future and my family's
 future. I sincerely hope we all have a
 happy life.       Shilpi Bakar.       </content>
