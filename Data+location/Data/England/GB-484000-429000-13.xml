		<content>  It is a wonderful reflection upon the
 caring attitude of many of the adults 
 in  Newport, that so many clubs are   
 available for the community.          
  The youngest children attend the     
 Brownies, which is run with much good 
 humour.Older children have the        
 opportunity to join the Girls Brigade 
 or the Boys Brigade.Both these clubs  
 organise a variety of sporting and    
 educational activities.               
  Teenagers have the opportunity to    
 join the  Youth Club where they meet  
 to listen and dance to music, play    
 snooker, table tennis and other       
 interesting pursuits.                 
  Newport is a keen sporting village,  
 having a successful football club and 
 a newly formed cricket club.The local 
 pubs also support enthusiastic darts  
 teams, who have raised money for local
 charities.                            </content>
