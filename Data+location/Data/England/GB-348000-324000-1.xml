		<title>01Summary of the Area</title>
		<content>  This D block covers a region South of
 Wem and north of Shrewsbury. It is a  
 rural area for the most part, with the
 village of Clive in the far S.E.      
 corner being the only major area of   
 housing.  This is a medium sized      
 village by Shropshire standards, and  
 is situated at the western end of     
 Grinshill.  It has close connections  
 with the village of Grinshill which is
 further east along the scarp slope of 
 the hiil. Grinshill can be easily     
 spotted by a distant observer by the  
 beacon of red lights at its summit,   
 to guide aircraft at R.A.F. Shawbury. 
 The rest of the D block area is gently
 undulating, made up of farmland used  
 for the most part as grassland for    
 cattle and fodder crops.Some cash     
 crops are grown such as oil-seed rape.
 The only exception to the farmland is 
 the civil airfield at Sleap in the N.W</content>
