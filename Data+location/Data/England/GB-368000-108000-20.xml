		<title>20Pulham Village</title>
		<content> The whole of Pulham village is on the 
 surveyed block.Written as"Poleham" in 
 the Domesday Book,its priest is named 
 as"Rainbaldus".Canning's Court nearby,
 thought to be a corruption of Canons' 
 (or monks')Court was the seat of the  
 Halsey family for 300 years.          
 Decimated by the Black Death,Pulham   
 moved to clean ground,further from the
 church.Traces of deserted dwellings   
 can still be seen.Derelict houses are 
 remembered at Pulham Lake,a marshy    
 once unenclosed area,now under plough.
 There is some industry in Pulham.A saw
 mill produces pallets,posts,gates and 
 fences;and a factory makes steel      
 structures to be used in building.    
 Built in 1950,the village hall is in  
 constant use.The Post Office(run by   
 the Boyt family for 66 years from     
 their council house)is the centre of  
 village life.                         </content>
