{PRESTON BOATS FARM}is a l60 acre mixed
 farm, typical of its area, owned by Mr

 l6th C. building. Store cattle are    
 bought in the Autumn, fed on silage   
 made during the Summer,and sold for   
 slaughter in the spring. Sheep are    
 farmed in a small way,some pigs are   
 also kept. Crops include:-            
  Oil Seed Rape - for the food industry
  Grass         - for silage           
  Barley and Wheat for brewing         
 All the work is done by the owners    
 with the help of casual labour in the 
 busy season.Machinery includes 3      
 tractors and 1 Combine Harvester.The  
 farm buildings are designed to make   
 the work easier with a central area   
 for silage and cattle sheds on either 
 side.                                 </content>
