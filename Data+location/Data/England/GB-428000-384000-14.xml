		<title>14A look at our block.</title>
		<content>  The nature of Sheffields land is that
 it has a lot of hills, therefore there
 is a lot of hill farming, this is     
 mainly with sheep and cows.All of the 
 factorys are on the east side of the  
 city. This is because the west side of
 Sheffield is very hilly and not       
 suitable for factories, so the west   
 side is only houses, the houseing     
 stops very abruptly as there is no    
 building allowed in the green belt    
 area so you can get from the city     
 centre to the country side in about 20
 minutes. The area that we live in is  
 all sandstone, therefore our school   
 is made of sandstone so is the church 
 next door to us and the other old     
 buildings in this area.Another        
 characteristic of the area in the hill
 farming industry is drystone walls    
 which are made of gritstone .
