		<content> SUPERNATURAL EVENTS AT THE BAY HOTEL. 
                                       
 THE FIRST SIGHTINGS OF GHOSTS WERE IN 
 1980,IN ROOMS SIX AND EIGHT.THE       
 EVENTS OCCURRED OVER A PERIOD OF SIX  
 TO EIGHT MONTHS. AT THE HEIGHT OF THE 
 TROUBLE, THE HOUSE OPPOSITE HAD       
 PROBLEMS AS WELL. MOST OF THE         
 SIGHTINGS WERE ON A SUNDAY EVENING.   
 GHOST HUNTERS WERE CALLED IN.THEIR    
 IDEA WAS THAT SOMEONE HAD A "KEY"     
 TO A GATE AND UNKNOWINGLY HAD         
 UNLOCKED IT, CAUSING ALL THE          
{"INTERFERENCES"                       
 ONE OF THE REASONS IS THAT THE BAY    
 HOTEL MAYBE BUILT ON A SACRIFICIAL    
 BURIAL GROUND. ON ONE OCCASION MRS    
 RATTON, THE OWNER WAS TALKING TO A    
 CHEF, WHEN THE BAR WENT QUIET. THEY   
 LOOKED IN AND SAW EVERYBODY STANDING  
 STILL. NOBODY WAS MOVING, NOT EVEN THE
 DOG.                                  </content>
