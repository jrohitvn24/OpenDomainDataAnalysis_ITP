		<title>09Yaldens Farm, Eversley</title>
		<content>   {Yaldens Farm}was mentioned in the  
 Domesday Book. The{Parsons family}have
 been running the farm for forty years 
 but before that it was owned by       
 someone else. The crops the Parsons   
 grow are potatoes, corn, kale (which  
 they feed to the guinea fowl) and     
 maize, barley, wheat and oats. The    
 Parsons own eleven acres at Yaldens   
 and another farm of two hundred acres.
    The animals on the farm are very   
 varied. They have ten ewes, fourteen  
 lambs and a very successful breed of  
 pigs called Searchlight. There are a  
 lot of different kinds of poultry     
 including hens, ducks, geese and      
 guinea fowl. Some of them they sell   
 and some they keep for eggs.{Yaldens  
{Farm}is a family farm which everyone  
 in the family helps to run.
