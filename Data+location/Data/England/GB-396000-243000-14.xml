		<content> My favourite game at school is{       
{Rounders.}There are two teams, one    
 fielding ,one batting. The fielding   
 team has a bowler, backstop, 4 posts  
 and fielders. The bowler bowls the    
 ball and the first batter hits. If the
 bowler bowls too high or too low it is
 a{No Ball.}If it is hit, a fielder    
 tries to catch it. If he succeeds the 
 batsman is{Out.}If he misses then he  
 tries to get the ball to a post to    
 stop the batsman because if a batsman 
 runs all the way round without        
 stopping, it is a rounder.            
 My favourite game at home is tennis.  
 I play with a{Tennis Come Back}thing. 
 It is a ball on a piece of elastic and
 when you hit it with a tennis racquet 
 it comes back to you and you hit it   
 again and again.
