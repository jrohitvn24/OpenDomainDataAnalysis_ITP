 In Lancing there is a house called the
 Old Forge.At first it was used for a  
 Blacksmiths cottage.Then it was used  
 for a tea place where you could get   
 something to eat or drink.In the      
 garden they found a sign to attract   
 people to come and have a drink.The   
 house is very big and has a massive   
 garden.Just before you go through into
 the house there is a porch and either 
 side there is two seats,that might    
 have been where people stood when it  
 suddenly started to rain.             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
