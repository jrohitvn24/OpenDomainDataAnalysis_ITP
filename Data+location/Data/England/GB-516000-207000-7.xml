		<content> There are lots of shops in Fleetville 
 but they are cramped up together.     
 There are too many similar kinds of   
 shop which means a lack of variety of 
 goods. There is only one supermarket, 
 the Co-op. The other shops are D.I.Y. 
 stores, newsagents, greengrocers,     
 motor car sales and garages, glass    
 cutting, confectionery, off licence,  
 launderette and public houses.        
 In our{survey}people said that        
 Fleetville was dirty, dull and untidy.
 They said that the flow of traffic was
 too much and parking space too little.
 They commented on the friendly        
 services in the shops and on the need 
 for longer opening hours.
