		<title>17LEGEND IN KIRKBY LONSDALE</title>
		<content> One of the most prominent features of 
 Kirkby Lonsdale,and the most          
 visited,is{Devil's Bridge.}This       
 medieval bridge has 3 arches,the      
 central one of which spans the river  
 Lune with a large arch.It originally  
 carried all the traffic but was closed
 in{1928}and now serves pedestrians    
 only.In summer chidren and others     
 sometimes jump from the bridge into   
 the deep water below.The origin of the
 bridge is unknown,but legend has it   
 that a man and his dog wanted to cross
 the flooded river.An old woman or     
{witch}appeared and offered to build   
 him a bridge,provided she could have  
 the soul of the first living creature 
 which crossed it.When the bridge was  
 completed the man threw some food     
 across the bridge and the dog ran     
 after it and so crossed first.In her  
 anger the witch disapeared.           </content>
