		<title>12The River</title>
		<content> The Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation 
 runs through our area.Before it was   
 canalised it was River Chelmer.The    
 countryside around it is very         
 attractive.There are three locks and  
 weirs in our area.They are{Cutton,    
{Stonhams }and {Little Baddow Lock.}   
 Beside the river there is a lot of    
 farmland.The river has to be dredged  
 once a year so that the barges can get
 through.                              
 Lots of people go there to fish and to
 canoe.It is a very quiet spot         
 with plenty of wild life and flowers  
 along the well kept tow path.The new  
 road comes right next to the river.The
 builders have been making the new road
 for a year. We are concerned it will  
 spoil the countryside and pollute the 
 river.{Is this progress.?}
