		<title>01VILLAGE OF BISHOPS LYDEARD</title>
		<content> The first indication of settlement is 
 a hoard of Roman coins found just     
 south of the village. The first       
 written evidence was in 904 when King 
 Edward the Elder gave the village to  
 his tutor,the then Bishop of          
 Sherborne.                            
 The village expanded and changed since
 then in line with national social     
 changes and events,however since the  
 Second World War it has expanded out  
 of all proportion now having 2153     
 adults on the Electoral Roll.         
 The local administration is by the 15 
 elected members of the Parish Council.
 Despite the large influx of           
 people,"old" and "new" villagers work 
 as one to maintain an interesting and 
 friendly community in which to live   
 and grow.
