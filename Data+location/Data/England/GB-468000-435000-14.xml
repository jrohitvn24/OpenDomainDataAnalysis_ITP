		<title>14The old railway at Bubwith</title>
		<content> The railway came to Bubwith in 1848   
 and the station closed on 20th.       
 September 1954.The old railway line is
 now a footpath as far as Holme upon   
 Spalding  Moor (east of the River     
 Derwent). A most interesting relic is 
 the{old viaduct}that crosses the river
 near Bubwith. Two years ago several of
 the arches were dismantled for safety 
 reasons.                              
 On walking eastwards from the viaduct 
 you pass through{Dingle Dell Nature   
{Reserve,}which is used a lot by the   
 local people for walking dogs and     
 playing. Few remnants of the old      
 railway can be seen: the cinder track,
 two old gate posts,and signal         
 box remain. Several old items are kept
 at the old station house, and the old 
 station can be seen.
