		<content>  Mr. Harris, a coal mine owner built a
 village to house his miners and called
 it Harris Town. Later this became     
 shortened to Harriston.               
  The houses, in terraces, had no      
 running water or toilets. The mine    
 closed down in 1907.                  
   The local council decided that the  
 village should be demolished and the  
 people rehoused. However they         
 petitioned to remain. A new village   
 was built row by row. As one new      
 terrace was completed, the residents  
 moved across and their old houses were
 demolished. Then a new terrace was    
 begun on the site.The new village was 
 completed in 1977 and won awards from 
 the Civic Trust for its design.       
  It looks attractive with a variety of
 house styles and many green spaces,   
 but some of the old residents say that
 they preferred it the old way.        </content>
