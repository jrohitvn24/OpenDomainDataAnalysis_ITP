		<title>03ROAD HAZARDS OF BILBROOK.</title>
		<content> Many villagers in Bilbrook believe    
 that the lanes and even the main      
 road are hazardous.                   
  The main road appears to be too      
 dangerous to cope with sets of t-     
 raffic. Many pets and wild animals    
 have had their lives come to an       
 end on these badly equiped roads      
 The road has had petitions put        
 against it. But these petitions       
 did not succeed. Soon after these     
 petitions were turned down a very     
 sad incident occured,a young girl     
 named Joanne, aged 18 was killed      
 due to someone else overtaking co-    
 ming the other way because of the     
 road being to narrow.Many motorcy-    
 clists have also been killed after    
 driving into tractors etc.            
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
