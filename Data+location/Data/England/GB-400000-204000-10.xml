		<title>10DAGLINGWORTH QUARRY.</title>
		<content>  The Daglingworth Quarry is about 4   
 kms from Cirencester on the A417      
 Gloucester  Road. It has been a Quarry
 since 1935, and covers about 100      
 acres. The stone is used to build     
 houses, stone walls,for landscaping   
 and to provide support in pipelines.  
  The men blow holes in the ground     
 with explosive every 2 weeks. The     
 stone is then ready for sorting, using
 screens which are like giant sieves.  
 After going through 3 crushers the    
 stone is like dry sand or dust.       
  The dumper trucks are yellow,        
 their wheels are about .5 metres wide 
 and about 1.5 metres high. The tread  
 on the tyres is very big and gives    
 good grip. Their carrying capacity is 
 27 tons of stone. The cab window is   
 made of dark plastic which provides   
 good protection for the driver against
 flying rocks.   CONTINUED             </content>
