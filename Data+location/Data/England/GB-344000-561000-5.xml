		<content> All Saints' Church probably dates from
 the early 13th. century; it is built  
 in the Early English style from local 
 stone.                                
 At the western end of the church      
 is the tower. It was originally a Pele
 Tower built about 1360 with 4 feet    
 thick walls and narrow loophole       
 windows. It was a place of safety     
 during border raids. The tower was    
 restored in 1962 by Canon Donaldson.  
 There are two bells, the earliest     
 probably dating from the 14th century.
 At the west end also is Roman altar   
 stone which is thought to have been   
 brought from{Birdoswald.}             
 There have been earlier restorations, 
 in 1828-9 when pinnacles were added   
 and in 1867.                          
 The windows are lancets. Three are    
 stained glass memorials.
