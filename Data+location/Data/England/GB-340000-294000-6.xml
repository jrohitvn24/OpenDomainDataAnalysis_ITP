 wheel house is made of stone. The     
 floor of the upper room of the mill is
 broken-up.{There is no wheel}in the   
 wheel-house but there is a hole in the
 floor where it went.There is a cow    
 house with no roof and a Dutch barn   
 made of corrugated iron.              
  {The mill-stones were broken-up}and  
 were in the yard or in the lane       
 hedges.                               
   The stables were brick with a tiled 
 roof.The pig-pen was brick with a     
 corrugated roof.The mill house is made
 of brick.{The earth closet}in the     
 garden is still used.                 
   The mill race is like a dried-up    
 stream and the pond behind the mill is
 empty.The overflow runs into an old   
 sheep-dip then back into Darnford     
 Brook.
