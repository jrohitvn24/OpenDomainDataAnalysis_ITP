		<title>05CHURCH BARTON FARM</title>
		<content> There are four hundred acres growing  
 barley, wheat and rape.  The rape is  
 used for cooking oil. {One man}looks  
 after the whole farm except at harvest
 and sowing times.  Last year the      
 harvesting was done during two weeks  
 in August and the seeds were sown by  
 the middle of September.  When the    
 present farm labourer started work on 
 this farm forty years ago, there were 
 forty workers.                        
                                       
 The main reasons why there are less   
 workers are the use of{chemicals}and  
{machinery}including combine harvesters
 tractors, ploughs, sprays and         
 turbo-choppers.  The plough we saw had
 eight large blades.                   
                                       
 They have a lot of trouble with{pests,
 especially foxes, rabbits and brent   
 geese which come in the winter.       </content>
