		<content> The first rector{a monk}lived above   
 the{Holy Well}at Trezance Farm.The    
 monastic house was closed about 1550  
 and some of the stones can be seen at 
 Trezance Farm.The original rectory was
 built of stone in about 1840 on what  
 is now the lawn of Cardinham House a  
 holiday complex.It was{bombed in 1942 
 and demolished about 1950 when a new  
 rectory was built.                    
 There has been a church here for 1600 
 years.In1480 the present church was   
 built ,the nave and aisles made of    
 granite .The aisle's roofs are        
 original 15c. oak ones but the nave   
 was reroofed in the 1880s.The roofs   
 need{repairing urgently}but the walls 
 and floor are sound.The{bats}damage   
 woodwork and floors with their        
 droppings.Because they are a protected
 species they cannot be moved.. _
