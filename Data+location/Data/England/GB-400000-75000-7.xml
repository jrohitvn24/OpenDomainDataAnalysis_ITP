		<title>07Strange Things at Durlston</title>
		<content>      Within our study area there are  
 strange bollards and signs. These are 
 London street bollards of cast iron,  
 which are now used as fence posts,    
 gate posts or just marking some long  
 forgotten boundary, they are even part
 of an old kissing gate at Durlston    
 Farm.                                 
      John Mowlem, a London mason,a    
 Swanage man originally, with his      
 nephew George Burt; brought them to   
 Swanage when alterations and          
 demolitions in London were destroying 
 them.                                 
      These bollards have the names of 
 many London districts on them.        
      Throughout the Durlston area     
 there are also many inscriptions on   
 stone tablets provided by the         
 Victorian benefactor George Burt.
