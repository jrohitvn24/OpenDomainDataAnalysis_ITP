		<title>03CASTLE AS TOURIST ATTRACTION</title>
		<content> All age groups visit the castle, from 
 babes in arms to old age pensioners.  
 It seems to be most popular with young
 families because they can pursue a    
 wide range of activities, although it 
 is  also quite popular with the       
 elderly.                              
 The average size of a group visiting  
 the castle is about three.            
 The castle is visited by people from  
 both home and abroad. It is reasonably
 popular with people living in the     
 locality, some of whom take friends or
 relatives to visit it.  Of foreigners 
 who visit the castle, we found the    
 majority to come from Europe and North
 America.  Whilst down there, we saw   
 Canadians, French people and some     
 Pakistanis for instance.
