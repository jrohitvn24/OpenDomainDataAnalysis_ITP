		<title>17THE GUIDE CAMP</title>
		<content> On Friday our Guide Company went      
 camping at Primrose Hill in Scawby. We
 set off at 5.30 pm and when we arrived
 we put our tents up and prepared our  
 sleeping bags. At 8 o'clock we had our
 supper and got ready for bed. Next    
 morning we cooked bacon and beans on  
 our camp fire. After breakfast we made
 up our bedding rolls and cleaned our  
 tents and then we went for our        
 activities. There are several things  
 to pick from but I chose shooting and 
 printing. After we had finished it was
 time for tea and then we all gathered 
 round the camp fire for a sing_song.  
 Each patrol had to sing a song or     
 perform a stunt. Next morning it was  
 time to return home so we struck camp 
 early and returned to Barrow after a  
 very happy weekend.
