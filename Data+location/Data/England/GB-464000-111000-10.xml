		<title>10Working In The Denmead Area.</title>
		<content>  Denmead and Wecock are both primarily
 dormitory towns for workers from the  
 major towns and cities that lie within
 10-20 miles of our area. Employment   
 within our area is very limited.      
  Most employment in our area is in    
 farming, market gardening or          
 part-time work in shops and pubs.     
 There is also some light engineering  
 industry developing now on the        
 outskirts of Denmead.                 
  Although there is very little        
 employment available in Denmead       
 unemployment is relatively low. Male  
 unemployment is at about 5%, female   
 unemployment is at about 6% and youth 
 unemployment at about 16%.            
  The dominant feature of employment   
 here is that of commuters. Most of the
 people who live here are employed     
 elsewhere and so the need for jobs    
 here remains low.                     </content>
