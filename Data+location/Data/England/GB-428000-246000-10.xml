		<content> In Fullready and Pillerton Hersey most
 of the houses are old and made of     
 stone. In Pillerton Priors the houses 
 are made from varios materials because
 there are more new houses in Pillerton
 Priors than Pillerton Hersey or       
 Fullready. Pillerton Priors is        
 convenient for people who work in     
 Banbury and Stratford because it is on
 a good quality B.road(B4451).There are
 bungalows where the elderly live but  
 generally the population is younger.  
 Pillerton  Hersey  has a Manor House  
 and retains a greater amount of older 
 properties.Fullready has mainly farm  
 houses and only two workers cottages  
 which are brick built but of the late 
 Victorian era.All the properties in   
 the villages have mains water,        
 electricity and sewage system.Most    
 have central heating either fired by  
 oil or solid fuel.                    </content>
