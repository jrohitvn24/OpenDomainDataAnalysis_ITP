		<content> There is a vast abundance of plant    
 life in the area, with large expanses 
 of green meadow. A survey was carried 
 out to examine the flora, in a square 
 metre. This was performed in three    
 different locations, in a field, by   
 the roadside and on the grass verge by
 the seashore. In square one, in the   
 field, there were many different types
 of grasses. Plantain and Dover were   
 very common, with birds-eye speedwell 
 playing a less important role. No     
 other plants could be seen. In the    
 second square, which was positioned by
 the road side, a number of colourful  
 plants could be identified among the  
 grass. These included a patch of      
 Vetch, Pink Campion, Daisies,         
 buttercups and Yarrow. The third      
 square was positioned on a grassy     
 verge on the coast road, The grass in 
 this square was much coarser.         </content>
