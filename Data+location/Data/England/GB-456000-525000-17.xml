		<title>17Legionnaires Disease Scare</title>
		<content> The killer disease Legionnaires       
 Disease was thought to have affected  
 Redcar.                               
                                       
 The scare went up on July 10th 1985   
 when a report in the local newspaper  
 said that organisms of the disease had
 been traced in the water systems of   
 four buildings in the county.         
                                       
 It was later revealed that The Gables,
 an old people's home in Redcar with   
 43 residents, was one of these        
 buildings.                            
                                       
 With 39 people dying from the disease 
 in Staffordshire it was quite a scare.
 The County Council Leader said that   
 the scare was over as the bug was     
 dead and the buildings were given the 
 "all clear".
