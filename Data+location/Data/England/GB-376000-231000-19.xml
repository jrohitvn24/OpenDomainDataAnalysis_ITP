		<title>19An Old Lady Remembers</title>
		<content> When interviewin Mrs. Wadley what she 
 said most was how the place had       
 changed. Years ago there were a lot of
 shops, now there is only one.  Years  
 ago Berrow Wood School was a mansion  
 called Fisher's Place. The owner of   
 the mansion(Mr. Fisher) had many      
 houses and farms, which now have been 
 sold to private owners. Mr. Fisher    
 gave prizes to Pendock School children
 for their work about 47 years ago.    
 Near my house is an old chapel built  
 in 1824 and converted into a house six
 years ago, the tomb stones were moved 
 to Pendock Parish Church. Where I live
 used to be a pub, called The New Inn. 
 Mr. Pattison's house was the village  
 stores.  Mr. Moore's house used to be 
 the blacksmith's, now called The Old  
 Forge. Opposite my house used to be a 
 shop, post office and wheelwright, now
 it is just a cottage.                 </content>
