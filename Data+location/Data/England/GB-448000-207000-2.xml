		<content>The difference between State and       
Private Schools is that the government 
pays for State schools but parents of  
private pupils pay the school.We of St.
Gregory's State school visited the     
Dragon Private school.                 
Dragon pupils have 3 science           
laboratories while we have 1.They take 
biology and physics/chemistry          
separately while we have science.They  
also take History and Geography whereas
we have "Social Studies".              
Our English is streamed,theirs is not. 
We start to learn French at the age of 
11.They start at 7.They choose Greek or
German at 10.Music and Art&amp;Craft in our
school have a large room each,while    
they have several rooms for each.They  
have separate lessons for Art,Craft,   
Wood/Metalwork.St.Gregory's has an     
all-in-one lesson.
