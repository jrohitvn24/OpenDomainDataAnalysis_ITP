		<title>17BADDESLEY CARNIVAL.</title>
		<content> Every August the people of Baddesley  
 hold a Carnival.There are decorated   
 floats and people in fancy dress      
 parading the streets.The procession   
 comes to a halt in the Recreation     
 Ground where there are stalls,games   
 and races.Here are two memories of the
 1985 Carnival....                     
 "This year I was a pirate on the Cubs 
 float.We decorated the boat with      
 cardboard waves stuck on the side.I   
 wore a red and white striped tee shirt
 and jeans which were cut off at the   
 knee.We all waited for the Queen's    
 Float to arrive and then we started.."
 "In the 1985 Carnival I was the       
 Princess and my sister was Queen. I   
 wore a blue lace dress with ribbons   
 around the top.I carried some flowers 
 which were real,not plastic.Later my  
 family held a party at home for all   
 our friends."                         </content>
