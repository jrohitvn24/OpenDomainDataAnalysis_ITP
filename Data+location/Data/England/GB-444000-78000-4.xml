		<content> From our survey we discovered that    
 134 adults live in this area and there
 are only 17 children of school age who
 attend the following schools-Chale    
 C.E.Primary-2,Ventnor Middle-3,       
 Nodehill Middle-4,Newport C.E.Middle-2
 Medina High-1,Carisbrooke High-2,Ryde 
 School(Private)-3.                    
 Several of them work on local farms   
 either in this area or in other places
 on the Island.Others work outside the 
 area in Printing,Boatbuilding,Offices,
 Teaching and in the Army.One person   
 commutes to London two days a week.   
 Seasonal work for women particularly  
 can be obtained at Atherfield Holiday 
 Camp.There is also a self-employed    
 Fisherman and an Electrical           
 Contractor.People moved into this area
 because its quiet and unspoilt,much   
 less tourism than other parts of the  
 island,some had family connections.   </content>
