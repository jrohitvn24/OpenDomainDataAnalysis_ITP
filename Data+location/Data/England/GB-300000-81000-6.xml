		<content> Every year at the Harvest Festival    
 celebration,Marpool Primary School    
 helps to collect food for the old     
 people. Cars are filled with the food 
 and are delivered to old peoples'     
 houses. Another appeal we did was for 
 the Ethiopians. We saw terrible       
 pictures coming from Ethiopia about   
 children and adults starving. Our     
 school helped by asking children to   
 bring little contributions to the     
 appeal. One hundred and fifty pounds  
 was raised.We also collected for the  
 National Society for the Prevention of
 Cruelty to Children. So far we have   
 raised twelve pounds and seventy five 
 pence.
