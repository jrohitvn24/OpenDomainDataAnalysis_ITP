		<content> If anyone needs medical attention a   
 helicopter from R.A.F.Chivenor will   
 fly them to the North Devon Hospital. 
 In the event of a fire they are able  
 to dispatch a fire-fighting package.  
 The helicopter can reach Lundy within 
 20 minutes.There are plenty of fire   
 extinguishers and in the event of a   
 fire all the residents would turn out 
 to help fight it.Likewise all the     
 residents are Auxiliary Coastguards   
 and they regularly have practice      
 sessions-sometimes with helicopters   
 and instruction in cliff rescue       
 techniques by the Hartland Point      
 Coastguard.12 members of the team were
 involved in rescuing the 7 crew of the
 Kaaksburg which ran aground off No.4  
 Quarry on the eastern side in November
 1980.                                 
 There used to be an agent who would   
 warn Lloyd's in bad weather.          </content>
