		<title>07LAYING A PIPELINE</title>
		<content> This pipeline is currently being laid 
 through East Wellow. The pipeline will
 be one hundred and thirty miles long  
 and will carry petrol, oil and gas. It
 will be finished by the end of this   
 year. At the moment they have about   
 one thousand men working on the       
 pipeline for six days a week, starting
 at eight a.m. and finishing at seven  
 p.m.                                  
                                       
 The pipeline is split into three      
 sections each of which has its own    
 base office. Laying the pipeline      
 involves the use of heavy machinery   
 such as diggers,cranes and pipe       
 lowerers. The pipeline is made of     
 steel and is buried three feet deep.It
 will carry five hundred million       
 gallons of fuel each year and will    
 cost forty million pounds.
