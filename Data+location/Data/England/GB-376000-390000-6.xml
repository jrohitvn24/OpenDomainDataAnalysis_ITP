		<title>06Ashton Park-Recreation</title>
		<content> Ashton Park is a residential area. The
 amenities it offers are two bowling   
 greens, two football pitches, four    
 tennis courts, one putting green, two 
 playgrounds and a sand pit.           
   We asked a sample of forty adults   
 how they use Ashton Park. Walking was 
 the most popular pastime with tennis  
 coming second. Third was putting and  
 then came bowling. Some people just   
 sat down in the Park or went jogging  
 there.                                
   We also asked forty children what   
 they used Ashton Park for. Nearly half
 played football, a fifth played tennis
 and exactly half liked putting. All of
 them played on the fields and all of  
 them played in the playground and     
 nearly all of them played in the sand 
 pit.
