		<title>11Housing in Lea</title>
		<content>  The squares ref.5030 and 4931 consist
 of post war housing.Originally a      
 ribbon development of private houses  
 following Blackpool Rd.,the area has  
 changed in character several times    
 over the years.North of Blackpool Rd.,
 an estate of private housing was      
 followed by a large estate of Council 
 houses to the South named the         
 "Larches".Later a further Council     
 estate called "Savick",was built next 
 to the private housing.The Council    
 estates have changed in character     
 during recent years.Many homes are now
 privately owned and their appearance  
 changed.A new private housing estate  
 is currently being built to the north 
 of the Savick estate by several       
 speculative builders including        
 Maunders,Salvensens and Wimpey.
