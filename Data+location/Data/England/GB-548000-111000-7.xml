		<title>07BIRDLIFE AROUND LAUGHTON</title>
		<content> I am writing this at the beginning of 
 July, probably the best time to spot  
 birds in Laughton.                    
 We are fortunate to have a terrific   
 variety of birds. At school a robin   
 has the front garden as its territory.
 Swallows and house martins have nested
 nearby: at the moment the parents are 
 teaching their young to fly. There are
 some bluetits in my garden. In the    
 fields around the church there are a  
 lot of rooks, crows and jackdaws. If  
 you look carefully you will see       
 different members of the finch family.
 Kestrels and sparrowhawks often hover 
 looking for prey. Various types of    
 duck often fly overhead, and sometimes
 V-shaped formations of geese. Drivers 
 in the lanes around Laughton          
 frequently disturb magpies, jays and  
 pheasants.                            
                                       </content>
