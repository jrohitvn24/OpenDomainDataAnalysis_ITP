  This resident has only lived in the  
village for 10 months.She moved there  
from nearby Leamington Spa and lives in
half of a large old farmhouse(Home     
Farm) which has been converted into 2  
dwellings.                             
  She states that village people are   
warm and friendly but a lot older.     
Village clubs are not for her and she  
prefers Leamington Spa. She does not   
intend to stay in the village although 
she thinks it is good for the children 
because it is pleasant and safe.       
  She has a car,shops in Leamington,   
and visits the doctor in Harbury.She   
complains about loneliness and says    
that it is more of a man's village.She 
would like to see the school reopened.
