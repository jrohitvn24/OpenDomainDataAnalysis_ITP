		<title>02ROWTON BROOK FARM, QUERNMORE</title>
		<content>                                       
On the farm there are 1100 sheep and   
160 cattle.The cattle are for beef and 
the sheep for wool and meat.There are 3
people working on the farm they are    
Mr. Longton, his son and his grandson. 
His farm is 730 acres mostly on fells  
and hillside.Rowton Brook flows        
through  the land so that's where the  
farm gets its name from.               
     Over the years farming has got    
easier for the Longtons.Some of the    
changes are they have more machinery to
do more jobs,the fields are drained    
better than they used to be and the    
sheepdogs respond more quickly.Their   
sheep are fed more than they used to be
which makes them bigger and stronger   
The sheep are dipped 3 times a year.It 
is compulsory for them to be dipped    
twice a year.
