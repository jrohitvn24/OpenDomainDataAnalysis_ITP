		<title>16Aisby, A dying village?</title>
		<content> The village of Aisby is very isolated.
 There are about sixteen buildings     
 altogether and only ten of these are  
 houses. The houses, are placed in a   
 circle, and are built mainly          
 from brick, with slate roofs The      
 ages of the houses range from 100 to  
 170 years old. Only one house has been
 built recently. Most of the gardens   
 are overgrown.                        
  The road leading to the village is in
 need of repair and the verges and     
 hedgrows need cutting and trimming.   
  Aisby has no amenities, no           
 recreational facilities, no church and
 no bus service.                       
  There is no industry save for        
 farming, mainly barley and wheat and  
 pasture.                              
  Aisby seems to be dying as people    
 move out to the towns.
