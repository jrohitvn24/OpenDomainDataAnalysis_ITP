  What were the effects of the New     
 Link Road on local people?            
{   Farmers:}They agreed that it was   
 necessary, but they lost land and were
 not pleased.                          
   {Transport firms:}Whitbread Brewery 
 &amp; Heathcoat Textiles agreed that      
 deliveries were now quicker and fuel  
 was being saved.                      
  { Police:}In favour, traffic survey  
 on Blundells Road shows a drop from   
 6490 vehicles, per day, before Link   
 Road opened to 3730 after. Accidents  
 were cut from 25 in 1983_84 to 18 in  
 1984-85.                              
   {Traders:}Stated there was less     
 noise and traffic, but some transient 
 trade was lost.                       
{ Conclusion:}Many approved of the link
 road, despite loss of land and trade  
 to some people.                       </content>
