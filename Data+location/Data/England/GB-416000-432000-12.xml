		<title>12PAPER HALL, BRADFORD</title>
		<content>   Near our school there is{Paper Hall.
 It is a  very  old building, so old it
 is falling down.  It was built  in the
 middle of the 17th C.  The  house  was
 owned by rich people.  The  Paper Hall
 is {the oldest  house  still  standing
{near the  centre  of the city.}  For a
 long time  we haven't been able to see
 it properly.  We can only see the roof
 of the Hall. The rest is covered up by
 boards  because  people are  trying to
 save it.  Work began in Sept 1980.  It
 will take a lot of time and money.    
 Paper Hall is  important in Bradford's
 history  because{James Garnett,} owner
 of  Barkerend  Mills,   used  to  live
 there.   He  had {the  first  spinning
{machine  put in  his mill in 1792. }It
 was  important for Bradford because of
 the  Wool  Industry.    A {Paper  Hall
{Preservation   Society} is  trying  to
 raise  money  for  the Hall.          </content>
