    This year saw the amalgamation of  
 the Junior and Infant Schools at      
 Highcliffe to make a Primary School. A
 new path, now a flight of steps, was  
 built to link the two separate        
 buildings. A structure is also being  
 bought to cover the outdoor pool.     
    When the Elmfield Building first   
 opened 21 years ago as a primary      
 school, it won a{Civic Trust Award}for
 architecture. To mark the anniversary,
 celebrations took place including a   
 concert at which past and present     
 pupils performed.                     </content>
