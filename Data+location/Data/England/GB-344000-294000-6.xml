		<content>{1   Caer Caradoc}is{1,506 feet}high.  
 It                                    
 rises very steeply to 900 feet above  
 the valley. It is made out of volcanic
 and pre_cambrian rock.                
    Some people say that{Caradoc looks 
{like a crouching lion.}We can see it  
 from our classroom window.            
    From the top of Caradoc on a clear 
 day you can see as far as Snowdonia.  
    It has an iron age fort on the top 
 of it. The ditches are still very easy
 to see. A little way down from the top
 there is a small cave.                
    People lived in the fort when the  
 Romans were in Shropshire. There is a 
 story that Caractacus hid there from  
 the Roman armies. (Though local people
 think it was another hill near Clun)  
    During the Second World War a bomb 
 fell on Caradoc. It was the only one  
 to fall in the area.                  </content>
