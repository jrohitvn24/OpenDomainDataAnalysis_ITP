		<title>04 FOLKESTONE: HOUSING</title>
		<content>   Folkestone has a wide variety of    
housing, from the fishermen's cottages 
down by the harbour to the large       
Victorian and Edwardian villas in the  
west end of the town.                  
   Many old properties in the harbour  
area have been demolished and replaced 
with modern flats, but there are still 
great numbers of semi-detached and     
terraced houses there.                 
   At the opposite end of town many    
large villas were divided up into flats
after World War Two when the servant   
class virtually disappeared. Smaller   
post-war houses were built in the area 
close to Folkestone West station,      
designed to be spacious but easily run.
   The location of the town between the
North Downs and the sea has inevitably 
restricted the spread of housing, but  
even now space is being found for new  
housing developments.                  </content>
