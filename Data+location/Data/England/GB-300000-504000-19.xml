		<content>  The Mink Hunt on the River Ehen is an
annual event.Mink are small brown      
animals which make their homes in river
banks. They are not a native wild      
animal but were imported from America  
onto farms which bred them for their   
skins.Unfortunately some escaped and   
others were set free.They have now     
become a problem for the farmers       
because they kill lambs, ducks and     
hens.In May, the otter hounds come from
Warwickshire, Worcestershire and       
Herefordshire to hunt our local rivers.
  In August 1984, the new road was     
opened. It was built to divert traffic 
for the Sellafield Atomic Energy       
Complex from the village of Beckermet. 
It has considerably reduced the amount 
of traffic using the village and it is 
a much safer place.
