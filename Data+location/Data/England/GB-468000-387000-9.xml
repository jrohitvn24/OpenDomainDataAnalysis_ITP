		<content> Built in 1792, Grade II listed        
 building. Originally known as         
 "Mattersey Pentecostal Chapel".       
 Up to auction in July 1983 it was     
 administered by a Trust. The last     
 known members were Mr S Brown of      
 Scaftworth, Mr Dunkerley of Harwell   
 (now both deceased) and Mr P Walker of
 Everton.  In April 1984 it was        
 purchased by Mrs Ruff and husband. It 
 will be converted into a garage for   
 Chapel House. Activities transferred  
 to New Mattersey Chapel (associated   
 with the Bible College).
