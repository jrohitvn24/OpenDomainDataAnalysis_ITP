		<title>04ECOLOGY  WINTERBOURNE VALLEY</title>
		<content>{Conservation} Natural habitat for num-
 erous species of  butterfly  and  wild
 flowers.   Elm trees died due to Dutch
 Elm disease.   No oaks, but many vari-
 eties of woodland trees. Badgers, grey
 squirrels, deer, foxes, weasels, hares
 roam and breed. Birds of prey, migrant
 birds, resident birds,  adders,  slow-
 worms and grass snakes are  prevalent.
 The rabbit is  prone  to  myxamatosis.
{Climate &amp; Weather} Damp valley subject
 to frosts.     During the early 1980's
 springs were late;  there were two hot
 dry summers,  one wet summer,  two wet
 autumns and one winter blizzard.      
{Footpaths}   There are 18 public foot-
 paths  and  bridleways  in  the  area.
{Pollution}  Risk of fire in plantation
 &amp; heathland during a drought.  Winter-
 bourne stream polluted in 1985 by farm
 slurry killing food of the kingfisher.
