		<title>18Moving House into Cottesmore</title>
		<content> In March 1985 my Dad came home one    
 night from work,and said that we were 
 moving to R.A.F Cottesmore.My Mum said
 "Oh No!"because she was pregnant at   
 the time.On 10th April 1985 My Mum    
 went into Hospital to have my bother  
 called Stuart Brian Ward.He was born  
 at 6:00pm.On the 12th April 1985.My   
 brother Leon, my Nana and I went to   
 see my Mum.                           
 On the 29th of June I was very sad    
 because it was my last day at school  
 and the last time I would see my      
 friends.When we got to our new home at
 Cottesmore I went out and had a look  
 round.I found two parks and two new   
 roads:Bedale Street and Burley Circle.
 July 1st was my first day at school,it
 was also Sports Day.I came first in   
 the obstacle race.I'm getting to like 
 it at Cottesmore.My friend is called  
 David.                                </content>
