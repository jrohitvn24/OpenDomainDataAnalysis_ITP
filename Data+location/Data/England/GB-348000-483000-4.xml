 The Athenaeum was constructed in l780 
 as a coachhouse with a shippen        
 underneath.  It belonged to Leasgill  
 House.  In l872 it was given to the   
 village as a present to be used as a  
 meeting place.  It was called The     
 Athenaeum after the owner's (Mr.      
 Angles) gentlemans' club in Liverpool 
 called The Athenaeum Club and it      
 remained the same until l927 when the 
 stage was moved to the other side of  
 the hall and the library was          
 dismantled to make room for the       
 cloakrooms and a small Kitchen which  
 was built.  A new floor was put into  
 the main hall and the entrance was    
 moved to its present position.        
                                       
 In l984 the people of the village     
 began a fund to raise money to        
 renovate and up date the building.    </content>
