		<title>15STONERAISE PRIMARY SCHOOL(1)</title>
		<content> The log book of the school shows that 
 it was founded in about 1874.It was   
 extended in 1960.The name Stoneraise  
 comes from the fact that when the     
 school was built a huge terminal      
 moraine from an Ice_Age glacier had to
 be cleared.Near the school thousands  
 of tons of these stones were used in  
 the construction of the nearby M6.The 
 area was once part of the vast        
 Inglewood Forest,only vestiges of     
 which still remain.At one time,early  
 in the school's life,nearly all the   
 children who came to the school were  
 farm workers children.Farms employed  
 many labourer's who lived in tied     
 cottages.These labourers had large    
 families and the school was always    
 full.Also,after the last war many     
 families from the outskirts of        
 Carlisle were re_housed in nearby Low 
 Moor estate.These children also came. </content>
