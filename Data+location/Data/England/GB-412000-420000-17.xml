		<title>17WILLIAM HENRY SMITH SCHOOL</title>
		<content> People who go to the Wm Henry Smith   
 school sleep there every night. When  
 they go there they sleep in four bed  
 dormitories. They are all single beds.
 The staff check on them each hour, to 
 see if they are asleep,when they first
 go there. When they get older, they   
 get more pocket money and they can    
 sleep in a dormitory with fewer beds. 
 When they go to bed they have a       
 bookshelf so they can read for half an
 hour. When they go to the hostel, that
 means when they get older,they have to
 look after themselves and make their  
 own meals every day. They get smaller 
 dormitories when they get older and   
 get into the hostels. They can go home
 every weekend and see their families. 
 There is a flat above, because the    
 boys can still be naughty. A member of
 staff lives in the flat.
