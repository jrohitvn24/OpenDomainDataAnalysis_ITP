		<title>11Farming in Newton</title>
		<content>   Farming in this area has changed    
 over the years from arable to mainly  
 beef or dairy farming.Some farms are  
 almost totally self-sufficient while  
 others rely on seasonal help or sub-  
 contractors.Cattle are bought and sold
 at Rugby and other nearby markets.One 
 farm has a milking herd of 114 cows;  
 another is in the process of breeding 
 a pedigree herd of 215 Charollar      
 cattle while others deal mainly in    
 beef and sheep.(One farmer,though     
 originally born on a Welsh farm,spent 
 his early life as a boxer,becoming    
 British and Empire Heavyweight        
 champion).All farmers agreed that it  
 was essential to understand livestock 
 and to know the capabilities of       
 their own land.With numerous public   
 footpaths running over their land a   
 plea was made to 'close gates' and    
 keep dogs under control.              </content>
