		<title>13An Anstonian Remembers</title>
		<content>{Mrs.Butterfield}was born in Anston and
 used to live on{The Baulk}then{Main   
{Street.}There wasn't any piped water  
 then so they had to take containers to
 the{Town Wells.}Shallow troughs are   
 there with spring water in them. There
 was no electricity in the houses.     
 There were a lot of farms with dairy  
 cattle,pigs and sheep. It was a common
 sight to see cows walking along narrow
 roads from the fields to be milked.   
 Cattle were watered at Townend pond on
{Quarry Lane.}Anston Brook stream was  
 used as a sheep dip. Corn was taken by
 cart to the farmyard from the fields.A
 thrashing machine separated the corn  
 from the stalks. Cows were walked to  
 Worksop to the cattle market.On{Penny 
{Piece Lane}there were Starch houses.  
 They sold starch,nails and whitewash. 
 On{Mill Lane}there used to be a steam 
 mill that ground corn into flour.     </content>
