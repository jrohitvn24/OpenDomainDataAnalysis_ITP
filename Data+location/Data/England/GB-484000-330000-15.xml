		<title>15THE LIFE OF AN 8 YEAR OLD</title>
		<content> At 10 o'clock we have play everyone   
 goes outside. The boys play football  
 and girls play games like bulldog     
 scarecrow,tig, chain tig, things like 
 that. Sometimes some girls join in    
 with the boys and sometimes some boys 
 join in with the girls. When play is  
 over you get on with what you were    
 doing before play. At lunch some      
 people go home and some people stay.  
 Sally and I go home. Mummy and Daddy  
 can't give us lunch because they are  
 at work so Grandma gives us lunch.    
 Lunch starts at 12 o'clock and        
 finishes at 1 o'clock. If you go home 
 when you come to school you play till 
 the bell rings. In the afternoon we   
 usually do craftwork till 2 o'clock   
 because then we have play. After play 
 we come in and finish our craftwork.
