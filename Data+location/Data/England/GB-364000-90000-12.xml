		<content>}Bradford Peverell is a thriving new   
 village to the North-West of          
 Dorchester with a mixture of old and  
 new houses. Its population in 1983 was
 359.                                  
   The surronding area is hilly and    
 rural with two main farms Manor and   
 Gascoyne. They are arable and dairy   
 land.                                 
   Many people who live in Bradford    
 Peverell work in Dorchester, but many 
 years ago it was a farming village.   
   A number of buildings have been     
 converted into living houses. These   
 include the old village Post Office   
 and School house.                     
   The old village tree was felled but 
 the villagers decided to plant another
 one next to the village hall.St.      
 Mary's was first sited in 1289.
