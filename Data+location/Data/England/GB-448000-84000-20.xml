		<title>20Fashions    Emigrating</title>
		<content> Our school uniform is red and grey and
 our Mums chose what suits us best. At 
 home we like to wear our fashionable  
 clothes like jump suits, tight jeans  
 and baggy T.- shirts. Flared trousers 
 are out. It is fun to have florescent 
 jumpers, gloves and socks.{

 air-conditioning engineer. He cannot  
 find a job here so he has gone to find
 work and a house in Australia where it
 is hotter. We hope our house will have
 a swimming pool and that we shall soon
 make lots of new friends at school. We
 shall miss our Island friends. Mummy  
 will miss the long English evening and
 Daddy will miss going to Portsmouth to
 watch the football. My brother Matthew
 will miss the garden especially having
 snow in the winter. I shall miss going
 for walks in our lovely countryside.  </content>
