		<content> Children play lots of different games 
 in and out of school. Some children   
 play by themselves as there are no    
 friends that live nearby. They play   
 with{Lego}which are plastic building  
 bricks which are used to make models, 
 toy cars, plastic soldiers, and       
 dolls. Sometimes they play games with 
 their families, these are mostly board
 or card games. Most children enjoy    
 watching television.                  
{Football, netball,}and{rounders}are   
 three of the most popular team games. 
 Lots of people like to go on to the   
 downs. There is a place on the downs  
 where there is a rope tied to a long  
 branch, this is called the{gipsy      
{swing.}Nearly all the children have   
{bicycles,}which they can ride safely  
 on the quiet roads.
