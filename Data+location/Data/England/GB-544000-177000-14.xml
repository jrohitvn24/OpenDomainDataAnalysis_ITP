A few yards down the landing is my     
brothers' bedroom. That's my           
favourite, it overlooks the garden.    
(Mine overlooks the street.) They both 
have blue covers on their beds and     
their is always tidy. Next is the      
toilet. It is small, cold, and poky.   
The bathroom is quite long and the bath
is an olive colour, so is the sink and 
the carpet. We have 14 stairs which    
curl round and can be dangerous. The   
kitchen is the longest. It is bright   
and warm. The table is at the end of   
the room. The passage is long. At the  
end on the left is the front room. As  
you go inside it is quite noisy. The   
room is big and long and we have a     
television and video in one corner and 
a stereo in the other. That is my      
house.
