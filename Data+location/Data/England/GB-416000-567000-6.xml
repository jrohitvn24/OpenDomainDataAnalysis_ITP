		<content>   When I play outside I play with my  
 bike or my roller boots.  Sometimes we
 play with skipping ropes and the song 
 is "Granny's in the kitchen, doing a  
 bit of stitching, in comes the        
 bogeyman and pushes granny out."      
   Sometimes we play with our baby     
 dolls but we mostly play on my two    
 swings.  We all play "Fox and Hounds" 
 in the {greenbelt.}The{greenbelt      
 is  a field in front of my house.     
   I play football on a five-a-side    
 pitch at the Institute with my        
 friends.  We play in an old tree in my
 back garden.  We get five cap guns and
 some caps and we play firing at each  
 other.  We play some games on the     
 computer like "Grog's Revenge".  We   
 also play "Ghostbusters" and "Spy     
 Hunter".
