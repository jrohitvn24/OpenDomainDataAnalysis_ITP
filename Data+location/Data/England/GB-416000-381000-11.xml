		<title>11WELLDRESSING AND CARNIVAL</title>
		<content> In its present form the carnival has  
 been taking place since about 1945.   
 A great deal of organisation has to   
 take place before the event.  Bands   
 are booked, the queen picked, stalls  
 erected, floats made and refreshments 
 provided.  After the parade and her   
 crowning the queen has several duties 
 like presenting prizes and            
 representing Bradwell at other        
 carnivals.  Putting on the carnival is
 expensive as bands have to be paid    
 and refreshments organised.  In some  
 years the money collected is not      
 sufficient to cover the costs and a   
 loss is made.  During the carnival    
 there are three welldressings in      
 Bradwell.  These are part of a old    
 Derbyshire tradition which thanked God
 for the gift of water.
