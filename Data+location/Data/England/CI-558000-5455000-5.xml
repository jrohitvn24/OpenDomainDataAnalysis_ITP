		<title>05My visit to Ronez quarry</title>
		<content>   At Ronez quarry the lab technician  
 told us about the blasting and we saw 
 the tarmac machine. There is          
 blasting once a week. We went to      
 Sorrel point and saw the lorries going
 up and down the quarry tracks moving  
 the stone and ground onto conveyor    
 belts. The stone that is crushed is   
 taken by lorries up the track onto the
 cliff top. You can see where they have
 blasted because the cliff crumbles    
 away. The tracks have very hard wear  
 because the lorries go over them every
 day. The lorries have carried         
 tarmac to cover a{million}miles of    
 road. Ronez aren't the only producers 
 of tarmac &amp; rock in Jersey but make   
 most of it. They built their own road 
 which is part of la Route du Nord.
