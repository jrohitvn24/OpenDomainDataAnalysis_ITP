		<content> In the wood, now declared of Special  
 Scientific Interest, dominant species 
 of trees are beech, sweet chestnut,   
 oak, birch and ash. Hornbeam can also 
 be found. Most trees are native speci-
 mens except the sweet chestnut,       
 probably brought here by the Romans.  
 Shrubs such as the wayfaring tree,    
 dogwood and wild privet occur natur-  
 ally on the chalk soil. Plants include
 sanicle, moschatel, sweet woobine,    
 angelica and orchids. Spring brings   
 primroses, wood anemones and violets  
 and summer an abundance of nettle     
 leaved bell flower. Many species of   
 birds and butterflies can be seen also
 squirrels and dormice. Paths have been
 laid out and marked as nature trails  
 and walks. 3 Bridleways cross the wood
 making links with Chartham and New    
 House Lane. There is a car park at the
 entrance.                             </content>
