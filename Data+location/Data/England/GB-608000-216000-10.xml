		<content> Brightlingsea is also famous for the  
 building of fast racing boats in the  
 multihull classes.                    
 The classes that are currently the    
 rage are{Mystere}and{Tornado.         
 The Mystere is a class on its own but 
 is also regarded by many as the       
 training boat for its big brother the 
 Tornado, this being the Olympic class 
 racing machine.                       
 Both of these machines ( for their    
 specifications and performance take   
 them far beyond that of mere sailing  
 boats ) are hand built, to very fine  
 tolerances, in the workshops of{Reg   
{White.}The spars and beams are        
 manufactured just across the road in  
 the workshops of{Sailspar Ltd.}These  
 too have very fine tolerances in order
 to satisfy the International          
 scrutineers,for the complete units are
 exported all over the world.          </content>
