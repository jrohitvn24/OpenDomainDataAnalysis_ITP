		<content>We are going to write about Bricket    
Wood as that is where we live.         
There is a very strong sense of        
community in Bricket Wood, the idea of 
belonging to the village is felt by    
many people, so that it is more than   
just a place to live.There are many    
organisations which will help you when 
times are difficult. The Bricket Wood  
Ratepayer's Association makes sure     
that the local Councils do their job   
properly and keeps a watchful eye on   
building of roads and houses.It tries  
to find out the concerns of everyone   
in the community and puts them forward 
to the councils.
