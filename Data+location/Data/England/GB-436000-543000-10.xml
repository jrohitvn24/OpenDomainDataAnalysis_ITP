		<content> A particularly interesting aspect of  
 the natural history of the S.Hetton   
 area is the recolonisation of what    
 have previously been railway lines    
 supplying the industrial site around  
 the colliery.                         
     These disused lines are used as   
 footpaths by the local inhabitants and
 display a wide variety of plant       
 and animal life, which has developed  
 rapidly since the lines were closed.  
     Common plant species include,gorse
 rose bay willow herb,hawthorn,bramble 
 vetch,plantains and numerous grasses. 
     Interesting animals regularly     
 spotted by walkers are dragonflies    
 ground beetles,toads,hares and a wide 
 variety of birdlife notably swifts,   
 yellowhammers, wrens and kestrels     
 which are numerous along the lines.
