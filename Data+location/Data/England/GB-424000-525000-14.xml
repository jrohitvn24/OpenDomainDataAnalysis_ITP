		<title>14WOODHAM VILLAGE.</title>
		<content> Woodham Village is mostly residential.
 There are council houses, flats and a 
 private housing estate. Apart from    
 that there is some uncultivated land  
 that isn't even used for cattle. There
 is a little woodland area called South
 Agnew Plantation, which is mostly     
 deciduous trees. Woodham Village looks
 unfinished. The workmen have a lot to 
 do there. There are two shops, one    
 selling food and sweets and the other 
 is a chip shop.The houses are made of 
 brick and are mostly red. People have 
 to travel into Newton Aycliffe for    
 shopping and other facilities. The    
 Equestrian Centre to the east is now  
 closed because of a temporary problem 
 of access. The old woodland areas,    
 bridleways and footpaths have been    
 keptfor the use of the inhabitants.   
 James 1st was thought to have visited 
 Woodham Races!                        </content>
