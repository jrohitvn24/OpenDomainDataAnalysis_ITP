		<title>08NEW EMPLOYMENT IN HOOK</title>
		<content> 67% of people in the local district   
 are employed in the service industries
 and Hook itself has many offices near 
 the village centre,the main ones being
 Anadex and Racal Milgo.Apart from a   
 new block already started there are no
 more new office developments planned  
 in the future as this would alter the 
 character of the village centre.Most  
 industry is situated in the Osborn Way
 Estate. There are plans for 7.3       
 hectares of new industrial building to
 the east of the present estate.       
 Although the site is next to the      
 railway, access will be by a new road 
 joining the A30 and the A32. Other    
 types of new jobs will be created by  
 the increase in population. New       
 shopping parades are planned for the  
 central area including a much needed  
 large supermarket.
