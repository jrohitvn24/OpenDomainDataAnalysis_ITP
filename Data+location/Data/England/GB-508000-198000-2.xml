		<title>02The Railway Tunnel Watford.</title>
		<content>The railway line from London to        
Birmingham was built 148 years ago and 
it goes through Watford. There is a    
railway tunnel behind our school,      
Walter de Merton. It was built because 
the men who owned the land nearby would
not let the railway be built across it.
Instead, a cutting 21 metres deep and  
the tunnel had to be made to take the  
railway across more difficult ground.  
The tunnel is over a mile long and ten 
men were killed when they were digging 
it.  It goes under a park, houses,     
roads and fields.  There are           
ventilation shafts all the way along   
it.
