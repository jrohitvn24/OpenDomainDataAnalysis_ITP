      "Life today is generally selfish.
 People are interested only in what    
 they can get out of it and not what   
 they can put in. Lowering of standards
 is responsible for{lack of discipline,
{vandalism}and{crime}generally. The    
 most important factor missing today is
 contentment."                         
      "House used as a "bachelor pad". 
 Much time spent with friends. Sport   
 features prominently. My house is     
 usually a mess. I prefer to enjoy     
 myself rather than clean and maintain 
 my house. This will change (I hope!)  
 when I get married, if ever.          
      I love dogs but feel that my     
 jetsetting lifestyle would be unfair  
 to a dog. I love life and nearly      
 always live up to my financial limits 
 because life may be short.  I have    
 insurance for the future."            </content>
