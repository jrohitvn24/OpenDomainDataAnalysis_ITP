		<content> I live in a small row of terrace      
 houses.There are four streets March   
 street,Goosehill Rd, Ellinsterrace and
 woodhouse mount.The houses are        
 private.They are all old .I live on   
 Goosehill Rd it is a corner house     
 .There is a small fish shop and a     
 corner shop.Behind my house there is a
 big field.There is a park it has only 
 got swings in.Up Ellins Terrace there 
 are some gardens.There are some       
 gardens.There is a pub near where I   
 live,it is called the Hark To Mopsey, 
 my friend Anna lives there.The buses  
 come every quater of an hour to both  
 Wakefield and Castleford.             
 Most terrace housing can be found near
 the town shopping centre(grid square  
 3822).East of this area private       
 residential properties have been      
 built,these consist of detatched and  
 semi-detatched houses.                </content>
