  There are two churches in the        
 Eastern half of the block, and both   
 are Church of England. The church at  
{Kellaways}is dedicated to St. Giles,  
 the patron saint of cripples.         
  The church was originally situated   
 behind the corn mill on the River Avon
 but sometime between 1802 and 1811 it 
 was moved across the road because the 
 rats from the mill frightened the     
 young ladies, who would then not come 
 to church.                            
  The church is built of Bath stone    
 with lancet windows East and West,    
 where the porch is. It has a single   
 bell in a small belfry. There is a    
 service once a month taken by the     
 vicar of Sutton Benger.
