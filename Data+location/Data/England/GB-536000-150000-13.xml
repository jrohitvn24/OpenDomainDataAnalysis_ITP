 pond with a fountain and fish swimming
 in it. As you go in there are cages   
 with many sorts of birds, including a 
 parrot who talks. There are cages with
 guinea pigs, hamsters, mice &amp; also big
 and dwarf rabbits. Near the counter   
 they display squeaky mice for cats,   
 dogs' balls, collars, leads, pretend  
 bones and lots of animals' toys.      
 Guinea pigs cost about Â£6.            
 Rabbits cost about Â£8.                
 There is always a good choice.        
 At the back of the shop are heated    
 tanks with tropical fish.             
 In Oxted people keep many pets and    
 spend a lot of money on them.         </content>
