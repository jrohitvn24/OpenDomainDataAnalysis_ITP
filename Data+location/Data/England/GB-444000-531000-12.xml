		<title>12A Day in the life of David</title>
		<content> My name is David Gibson. I am a pupil 
 in Elwick C.E.Primary School. I am    
 nine years old. I get up at around    
 eight o'clock in the morning. My      
 sister gets me up because my alarm    
 clock keeps on going slow. Then I get 
 dressed, which takes me until five    
 past eight. Next I go into the        
 bathroom to clean my teeth. Then I    
 go and wake up all our pets and after 
 have some biscuits until twenty past  
 eight. Next I get my coat on and get  
 my bag ready for school. Then I get in
 the car for a six mile journey and    
 my Dad takes me to school to arrive at
 ten to nine. At nine o'clock school   
 starts and we have assembly. Then we  
 put all the hall furniture away and go
 into class to have a mathematics      
 lesson. Then we have break time and   
 next we have English lessons.
