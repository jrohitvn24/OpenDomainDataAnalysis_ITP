		<content> England has always been a country     
 where{people in need were             
{welcomed.}This in mind one expects    
 that to live in England as a foreigner
 one would{not have too many           
{difficulties.                         
{ }                                    
  In general I can confirm this. The   
 English people are very friendly and  
 help you as a foreigner wherever they 
 can. Particulary when you are aware of
 the fact that you are living in a     
 foreign country and{adapt to it's     
{customs and way of life.}It seems to  
 be easy to live here.However, there   
 can be quite a{few problems}when you  
 look at some details.
