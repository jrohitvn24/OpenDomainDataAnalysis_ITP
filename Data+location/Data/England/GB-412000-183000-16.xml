		<title>16Crime in Swindon.</title>
		<content> Swindon's crime-rate is on the        
 national average and is concerned     
 mostly with shop-lifting, vehicle     
 thefts and burglary. Assault crimes   
 are not common and soccer violence in 
 Swindon is on a small scale.          
 The 13-18 year olds make up the       
 largest age group involved in crime   
 and take up a great deal of police    
 time in sorting out all types of minor
 crime.                                
 The worst crime committed in Swindon  
 this year was the stabbing to death of
 a young man in a heated arguement     
 outside a public house.               
 The police are trying to improve their
 image with the public after violent   
 confrontations with striking miners.  
 A community policing scheme is aimed  
 at building links with young people   
 and develop a more caring attitude.
