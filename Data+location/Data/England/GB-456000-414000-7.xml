		<title>07ARABLE FARMING</title>
		<content> In spring arable farmers{harrow}the   
 fields which means they rake the      
 fields out flat. After harrowing the  
 farmer plants his crops with a{drill  
 machine. When not in the fields the   
 farmer maintains his machinery. In    
 summer the farmer{sprays}the crops    
 with insecticides so that insects     
 leave the plants alone. As well as    
 spraying they also{fertilise and water
 the crops. In autumn the farmer       
{harvests}the crops with a combine     
 harvester. This means cut down the    
 crops and separates the grain from the
 straw. Grain is kept in silos and     
 straw is kept in bales or stacks. On  
 the other hand peas have to be taken  
 to factories as quickiy as posible.   
 All the bits left in the field is     
 stubble. They{burn}the stubble or     
 plough it in. In winter they give it a
 final{plough}before winter.           </content>
