 area is farm land.The other two       
 twelfths is mainly residential.The    
 farm land is used for growing crops   
 such as wheat and oil seed rape.There 
 is some animal farming but not        
 much.Some of the land is used by      
 nurseries with large glass houses     
 where plants,fruit,trees,bushes and   
 vegetables are grown.Housing is varied
 with many bungalows occupied by people
 who have retired to the seaside.The   
 area has one of the highest sunshine  
 records in the British Isles and many 
 people come to the various caravan    
 sites to spend their annual holidays.
