		<title>04Employment in Scremerston.</title>
		<content> A number of years ago most of the     
 employment in Scremerston was local,  
 both{farming}and{mining,}but today    
 many men travel to Berwick-upon-Tweed 
 to work.Some travel even further to   
 Edinburgh and the Torness{Power       
{Station}in Scotland.                  
     Many married women work both full 
 and part-time in Berwick-upon-Tweed.  
 Most of them are{shop assistants,     
{shorthand typists}or{hairdressers.    
     There is no actual employment in  
 Scremerston and that is the reason why
 most of the people both young and old 
 travel out of the village to work.    
     Many retired people live in the   
 village and these are housed in the   
 sheltered housing at Armstrong Court  
 and in bungalows or Council houses.   
     The farms in the survey area are  
 worked by only one or two men as most 
 of the farming is mechanised today.   </content>
