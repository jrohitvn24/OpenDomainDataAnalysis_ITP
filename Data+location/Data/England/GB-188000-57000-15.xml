		<content> There are three places of worship in  
 Indian Queens.There are two Methodist 
 chapels on the main road and the      
 little church of St.Francis in St.    
 Francis Road.There is no vicar or     
 minister living in Indian Queens,and  
 the Church of St.Francis belongs to   
 the parish of St.Columb Major and both
 church and chapel are run from there. 
 The tradition around Indian Queens is 
 a strong Methodist one dating back to 
 the time when there were mines working
 nearby,and following the visits of    
 John Wesley in the 18th. century.The  
 church parish of St.Columb goes back  
 much further to the Middle Ages.In our
 time(1985) a minority of people go to 
 church or chapel,but those that do    
 work very hard.Recently Jehovahs      
 Witnesses have come to the area.They  
 go from door to door trying to get    
 people to become Jehovahs Witnesses.  </content>
