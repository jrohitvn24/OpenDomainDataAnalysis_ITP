		<title>07The Gravel Pits</title>
		<content>      There are gravel pits on the road
 out of{Marlow.}We saw the gravel being
 washed. The dredger puts in into the  
 boat and seives it. We saw the muddy  
 water coming out. There are two tugs  
 and three cranes.                     
                                       
      The gravel is used to build      
 houses and make cement. There         
 is a weighbridge there.               
                                       
      Where they have finished taking  
 out the gravel, there are coots, swans
 and grebes. We saw lots of blue       
 dragonflies and ducks and swallows    
 swooping down for food.               
                                       
      The lake is stocked with fish    
 for the Angling Club and they have    
 planted many new trees.               
                                       
                                       </content>
