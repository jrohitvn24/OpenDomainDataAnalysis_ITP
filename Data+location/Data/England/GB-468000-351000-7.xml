		<content> Mrs.Swan also said that the roads have
 always been tarmaced. One of the main 
 differences between 1945 and 1985 is  
 that in 1945 everybody knew everyone  
 else because not many people lived in 
 Southwell. But now everybody is moving
 in and out of Southwell and it seems  
 that people don't know each other as  
 well as they used to.
