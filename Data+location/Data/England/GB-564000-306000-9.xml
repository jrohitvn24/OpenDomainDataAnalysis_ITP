		<content>{Football Club:} Shouldham has had a   
 football club for many years,although 
 recently they have been through a bad 
 patch.They play on the Village Playing
 Field and their colours are gold and  
 black.This year the shirts have been  
 provided by sponsors.Unfortunately    
 many of the players now come from     
 other villages and will not follow the
 famous Alf Kirchen of Shouldham,who   
 played for Norwich 1933-34 for Â£4 per 
 week and later Arsenal.               
{Friends of the School:}Last year this 
 group was formed because it was felt  
 that owing to financial cutbacks the  
 Authority were unable to provide      
 resources for the school.Since its    
 inception the group has raised over   
 Â£700 and provided a colour television,
 playground marker,educational toys and
 books.The children also benefitted    
 from a Halloween Party.               </content>
