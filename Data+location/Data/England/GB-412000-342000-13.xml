		<title>13Private Transport</title>
		<content>Most households now have cars.  The    
lack of public transport means that    
anyone who has any distance to travel  
to work needs a car.  More and more    
households have two cars, one for the  
breadwinner to travel to work and one  
for taking children to playschool,     
primary school, shopping in town,      
attending dental or doctors            
appointments etc.                      
  The current pace of life means that  
fewer people are prepared to wait for  
public transport and they find it      
difficult to arrange appointments to   
fit in with bus timetables.            
  The number of children travelling    
around the villages on bicycles is     
diminishing, most parents not          
considering it safe to allow their     
children out in the evenings on their  
own.  This means parents have to take  
their children to, e.g. Youth Club.    </content>
