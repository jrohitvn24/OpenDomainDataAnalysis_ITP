		<title>12Traffic_A Local Concern.</title>
		<content> There was great concern recently in   
 the village over a proposal to make   
 the road passing through  Cheriton    
 a Designated Heavy Lorry Route.There  
 was a great deal of opposition because
 the road is so narrow and there are   
 dangerous bends without any footpath. 
 Many children walk to school that way 
 and it was felt it would be very      
 dangerous,also that damage and        
 pollution would be caused to a        
 beautiful village.                    
       The proposal was defeated,but we
 thought it would be interesting to see
 what sort of traffic was passing      
 through the village now.All of our    
 class took part in a traffic survey of
 north and southbound traffic.The      
 results are on the next two pages.
