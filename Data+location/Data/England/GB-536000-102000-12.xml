 At the southernmost point of          
 Ovingdean, and to the west of         
 Rottingdean, lies St. Dunstans, a     
 residential home for the blind. The   
 design of this west facing, 6 storey  
 yellow brick building situated between
 the busy A259 south coast road and the
 rolling fields of the South Downs does
 not fit well with the nearby          
 residential development.              
                                       
 To the left of the building lies a    
 coach and car lined driveway. There   
 are extensive lawns and shrubbery, and
 walkways with railings for the        
 assistance of its inhabitants, and a  
 subway to the undercliff and beach. It
 is a pleasant sight to see relatives  
 and stff walking with the inhabitants.</content>
