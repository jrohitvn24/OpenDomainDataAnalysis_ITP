		<content> The R.S.P.B. was founded in 1889 as   
 the Fur and Feather Group, primarily  
 to protest against the trade in birds'
 feathers for the millinery trade. In  
 1891, it widened its aims and became  
 the Society for the Protection of     
 Birds. Highlights during the early    
 years included the employment of staff
 in London from 1897, the publication  
 of Christmas Cards in 1898 and the    
 issue of a magazine in 1903. A royal  
 charter was granted in the following  
 year.                                 
 The original aim of the society, to   
 curb sales of birds' feathers was     
 finally achieved in 1921. During the  
 1920's the society bought land for    
 reserves, highlighted the problems of 
 oil pollution and warned against the  
 use of toxic chemicals in gardens.
