		<title>06Colerne Parish Church</title>
		<content> The chief glory of Colerne is the     
 Church of St John the Baptist.The main
 features in Colerne Church are the    
 clock and the tower. The clock still  
 works  today  by winding heavy weights
 and the unusual thing about it is 300 
 years old and only has one hand.      
 To get up to the top of the tower we  
 had to climb up a spiral staircase and
 then go through a small doorway. From 
 the top we could see most of the      
 Domesday area, such as the school and 
 some shops.                           
 In the belfry there is one set of     
 eight bells, these can be played in   
 two ways. Each bell has a rope which  
 can be pulled in the normal way by one
 of the eight bell-ringers or there is 
 a device which enables one person to  
 play hymns on the full set. There are 
 normally two services every Sunday.
