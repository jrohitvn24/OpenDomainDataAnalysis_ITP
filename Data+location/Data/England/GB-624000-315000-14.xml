		<content>    In{Hainford}there is only one shop.
 There are about one hundred customers 
 a day.It was built as a shop many     
 years ago.                            
  We interveiwed three people. They all
 use the shop twice a week.They all use
 the shop for things they have         
 forgotten in Norwich.                 
   In{Spixworth}there are seven        
 shops.The butchers and the fruit shop 
 are one hundred years old.The paper   
 shop is forty nine years old,the      
 grocery shop is thirty years old and  
 the other grocery shop is fifty six   
 years old.                            
   Three of the shops are general      
 stores.                               
   We interviewed eight customers,they 
 all thought the shops were useful.Five
 of the customers use the shops at     
 least twice a week.
