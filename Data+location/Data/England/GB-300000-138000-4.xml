		<title>04    JOHN</title>
		<content> John is  five years old and lives with
 his parents in a farm cottage in      
 Rodhuish. 'Aunty' Jill lives          
 next door. From his bedroom he can see
 the sea, lots of fields and the other 
 four houses nearby. There are no other
 children in the village so John spends
 his evenings and weekends playing with
 Kim, his 3 year old sister. John also 
 looks after his many pets including a 
 field mouse that he found recently on 
 a walk with his Dad. He walks a lot   
 but never alone as Dad thinks that the
 hills and farms are too dangerous.    
 Every Saturday the family go to       
 Minehead to do the weeks shopping in  
 the supermarket.                      
 Every weekday John catches the bus to 
 travel the 3 miles to Washford and    
 school. There he plays with his       
 friends.                              
                                       </content>
