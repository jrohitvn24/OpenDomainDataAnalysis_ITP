		<title>08THE RIVER THAMES AT ERITH.</title>
		<content>  From our school we have a good view  
 of the river which is half a mile wide
 and flows from west to east.          
  It is now very clean and over one    
 hundred species of fish including     
 salmon have been caught.              
  Many boats pass the school, including
 barges, colliers, launches, tugs and  
 containers.                           
  There are many wharfs and different  
 works beside the river. One paricular 
 wharf is for roll-on_roll-off paper.  
 It is the second deepest wharf in     
 Britain.                              
  The stretch of water opposite the    
 school is called Erith Reaches and it 
 separates the London Boroughs of      
 Bexley and Havering.                  
  A lot of rubbish found in the Thames 
 is unloaded at the G.L.C. warehouse at
 Coldharbour Point.                    
  We are lucky to be so near the river.</content>
