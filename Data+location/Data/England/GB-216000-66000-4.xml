		<title>04EDUCATION ST NEOT SCHOOL</title>
		<content> St Neot school is an old building .It 
 was built in 1870. In the summer of   
 1985 there was 76 children in the     
 school. There were three full time    
 teachers and one part time teacher.   
 There are two ancillaries. As there   
 are no canteen facilities in the      
 school the children walk to the       
 village institute for dinner. The     
 meals are cooked there by Mrs M       
 Bellringer. Very few children in the  
 school do not have school dinners. In 
 the school we have a BBC computer, a  
 photocopier, a colour television, a   
 bigtrak, (a programmable toy) and two 
 sets of technical lego.
