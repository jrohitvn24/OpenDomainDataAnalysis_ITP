		<title>01General summary of the area</title>
		<content>      This block lies within the{Oxford
{Green Belt. }It   is   mainly   rural,
 stretching   from   wooded   Corallian
 Sandstone  and Limestone escarpment to
 the  cultivated  farmland  on the clay
 vale.  Under  the  Structure  plan any
 expansion of villages is restricted to
 infilling.  Some inhabitants fear that
 they may become suburbs of Oxford.  It
 is  rich in history.  Much of the land
 was owned by Abingdon Abbey.  Today it
 is owned by Oxford colleges.          
      The  housing stock is varied:18th
 Century  and  earlier  Cotswold  stone
 dwellings  are  intermingled with more
 recent  brick  or reconstituted stone,
 ribbon    or    estate    development.
 Communities   are   close   knit.  The
 infrastructure  of  support  for young
 and  old  has  its  origins  in  local
 councils,  volunteer  groups  and  the
 Church.                               </content>
