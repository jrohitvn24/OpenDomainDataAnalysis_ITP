		<title>08MYTTON MILL - FORTON HEATH</title>
		<content> Until 1966 this was a working flour   
 mill, but its flour prices became     
 uncompetitive and the mill was closed.
 The building then lay derelict until  
 1971 when it was purchased by a local 
 firm of building contractors who used 
 it as their headquarters. In 1982 a   
 fire caused extensive damage to the   
 building and it was decided to totally
 restore the building.                 
                                       
 It is now sub_divided into a number of
 workshops which are let to various    
 small firms. These presently include  
 glass engravers, ceramic workers,     
 screen_printers, woodturners, double  
 glaziers, removal contractors, car    
 mechanics plus the headquarters and   
 workshops of the building contractors.
                                       
 It is also a lovely building in a     
 beautifull setting.                   </content>
