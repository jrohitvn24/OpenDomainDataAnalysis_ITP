		<title>20Farming in Upper Strensham</title>
		<content> There are 3 mixed arabel farms.       
 Strensham farm also produces market   
 garden crops. Cattle are raised at    
 Home Farm and there are also about 50 
 at Bredonfields, but none have dairy  
 herds. 50 acres of sugar beet and 30  
 arcres of fodder peas are grown at    
 Bredonfields. About 400 sheep are     
 bought in the Autumn kept through the 
 Winter and sold in early Summer.For   
 the most part the soil is light, with 
 terraces down to the river Avon of    
 glacial sand underlined with blue haig
 clay of the Evesham series. The M5 and
 the M50 were built through fields on  
 each farm and the junction of two is  
 at Bredonfields, so this farm was cut 
 into three. Only two farm workers have
 houses in the village. Bed and        
 breakfast accommodation is offered at 
 Strensham farm.                       
 Survey carried out by Strensham WI.   </content>
