		<title>12ARABLE FARMING IN WADESMILL</title>
		<content>This farm in the Rib Valley occupies   
about 170acres most of which is used to
grow cereal crops of wheat and barley  
with one or two fields of oil-seed     
rape. The wheat,either sown in winter  
or spring is stored in six large       
cyclindrical grain stores before being 
sold to a local milling company for    
processing into flour. The barley is   
either used as animal fodder or in the 
local malting.                         
Oil-seed rape,a relatively new crop,   
belongs to the cabbage family,         
producing bright yellow flowers in May 
and June. The seeds from these are     
crushed to extract vegetable oil which 
fetches a good price. The farmer uses  
it as a break crop between years of    
cereal growing, though it exhausts the 
soil so it is not grown on the same    
field more than one year in five. Near 
the farm are two meadows for horses.   </content>
