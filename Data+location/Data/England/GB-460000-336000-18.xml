		<title>18A smallholding</title>
		<content>   {Lees Barn}was built in 1890 on a   
 little lane which turns off the A52   
 road near{Radcliffe-on-Trent.}One of  
 its fields is called Lamcote Field and
 was once part of the Holme Pierrepont 
 estate. Now Lees Barn is owned by Mr.&amp;
 Mrs. Howard who have a smallholding   
 there.                                
    The land is used mainly to keep    
 chickens. There are 800 laying hens   
 which live in long huts but can also  
 wander round outside. We helped Mrs.  
 Howard to collect the morning's eggs. 
 We had to look carefully for them and 
 found 30 on top of a haystack! We     
 ended up with 230 eggs altogether.    
 Mrs. Howard told us that it costs Â£500
 to feed the hens each month.
