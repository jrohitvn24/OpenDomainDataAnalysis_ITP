		<content>{The Headland H/pool By Jayne Gibson}  
 In June 1982 I was a bridesmaid at    
 Valerie and Tony's wedding.Valerie is 
 my Aunt.My dress was white with frills
 at the bottom and it had 3 pearls at  
 the top.My Auntie Valery's dress was  
 white with a lot of frills at the     
 bottom.There were 3 other bridesmaids 
 who were grown-ups and wore pink      
 dresses.At{St.Hilda's Church}we walked
 down the aisle to the Vicar.Tony and  
 Valerie had to say{I do.}We then had  
 to{sign the Register}and after that we
 went to the reception in the car.The  
 bride's car had a big white ribbon at 
 the front.When we got to the reception
 there was a buffet and then a Disco.  
 After we had something to eat and     
 drink we went home.For their honeymoon
 they went to the Lakes.We put a ribbon
 around the car and tied tin cans on   
 the back.                             </content>
