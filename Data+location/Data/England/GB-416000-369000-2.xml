		<title>02MONSAL TRAIL</title>
		<content>{The Monsal Trail} is a pathway for    
 walkers and cyclists on the trackbed  
 of the former Midland Railway. The    
 railway was opened in 1863 and was    
 closed by British Rail in 1968. 12    
 years later is was handed over the the
 Peak District National Park for       
 conversion to a Trail.                
 The tunnels along the track were not  
 thought to be safe so the trail       
 bypasses these. The Trail leads from  
 Bakewell to Chee Dale not far from    
 Buxton. The Trail passes the former   
 site of several stations and the      
 remains of several lime kilns, at     
 least one of these has been restored  
 by the National Park. Much of the     
 route passes through or close to sites
 of special scientific interest and    
 nature reserves. A wide range of wild 
 flowers are now colonising the former 
 railway track bed.                    </content>
