		<content>                                       
 Since closure of the railway          
 line,access is by the A68 to the east 
 and B6320 the west of this block. The 
 river North Tyne divides the area and 
 is crossed to the North at Bellingham 
 and south at Wark by bridges. Minor   
 roads lead to farms and to dwellings  
 and the only{public transport}is by   
 the bus service linking Bellingham and
 Hexham with 7 return journeys daily   
 except Sunday when there are 5. Buses 
 and taxis carry{pupils to school}at   
 Bellingham, Wark and Haydon Bridge and
 can be used by fare paying passengers 
 as well.{Private transport}is         
 essential here and consists of cars,  
 landrovers, bicycles, motorcycles and 
 tractors during winter snowstorms.    
{Movement of livestock}and farm produce
 is by trucks whilst tankers collect   
 the milk direct from dairies.         </content>
