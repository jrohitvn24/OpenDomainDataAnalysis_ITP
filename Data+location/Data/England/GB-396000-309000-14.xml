  In a recent survey on favourite      
soap operas the American soap operas   
have the upperhand with Dallas and     
Dynasty scooping 50% of the votes.     
  "Eastenders" and "Brookside" were the
most popular British soap operas with  
"Coronation Street" and "Crossroads"   
the national favourites trailing       
behind.                                
  The children's favourite magazines   
range from pop comics such as "Smash   
Hits"  to educational magazines such as
"Computing". A number of sporting      
magazines came high on the list and    
included "Anglers Weekly","Cue World", 
and "Football Monthly".                
  Although Cannock does not have its   
own local radio station there are many 
regional radio stations.eg Beacon Radio
based in Wolverhampton and BRMB from   
Birmingham.                            </content>
