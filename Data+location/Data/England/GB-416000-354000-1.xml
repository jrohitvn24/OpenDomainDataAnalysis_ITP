 This block is situated about seven    
 miles north of the town of Ashbourne  
 in Derbyshire.                        
                                       
 Included in this block are the        
 villages of Alsop-en-le-Dale and      
 Parwich. Parwich is the larger of the 
 two.                                  
                                       
 Most of the landscape consists of     
 limestone hill country with it's      
 characteristic limestone buildings and
 walls. The land rises to about 1200   
 feet, which is dissected by a number  
 of dry valleys called, locally,       
 "dales". This is a rural area which is
 dominated by farms which practice     
 animal farming.                       
                                       
 The block lies within the Peak        
 National Park.                        </content>
