		<title>06NORTH BEDFORD LOCAL HISTORY</title>
		<content> Towards the opposite end of{Bedford   
{Park,}after passing near tennis       
 courts, bowling green and bandstand,  
 is the{Robinson indoor swimming pool. 
 Just north of this amenity is the main
 Bedford cemetery. Here can be seen the
 graves of the{Wyatt family,}who       
 founded the{"BEDFORDSHIRE TIMES"}in   
 1845 and which is still published     
 today. A few hundred yards walk away  
 can be seen the old-fashioned brick,  
 tower-like building, within which is a
 150 feet, deep, clear{spring water    
{well,}sunk in 1902 for a{local        
{brewery's}pure water supply. This     
 supply comes from as far away as      
 Northampton and is one of several     
 wells for the brewery in Bedford.
