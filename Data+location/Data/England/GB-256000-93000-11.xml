		<title>11OKEHAMPTON BY-PASS SURVEY</title>
		<content> We carried out a survey in Okehampton 
 and asked the following questions:    
 1 Do you think Okehampton needs a     
   by-pass?                            
 2 Which route do you think the by-pass
   should take?                        
 3 What are your reasons for your      
   answer in Q2?                       
 These are our results:                
 1  Yes = 29   No = 2.                 
 2  Northern = 7  Southern = 24.       
 3  Those who chose the southern route 
 gave these answers: good farmland     
 would be wasted and it could be pushed
 through parliament faster. For the    
 northern route people thought that the
 beauty of the Dartmoor National Park  
 should remain intact.                 
 We conclude that the vast majority    
 want a by-pass and the public is also 
 in favour of the southern route which 
 passes through Dartmoor.   Mike Ward. </content>
