		<content> There has been a{Christian}church in  
{Broadwell}since Saxon times. The      
 Rector of{Broadwell}looks after the   
 churches of{Broadwell, Adlestrop,     
{Oddington}and{Evenlode}with 1200      
 parishioners. He considers the        
 needs of the congregations so         
 that each village shares a variety of 
 Sunday services and weekday meetings. 
 He helps organise fetes and coffee    
 mornings, inspects the churches with  
 architects and builders, plans the    
 weekly school assembly and answers    
 many letters. He tries to visit each  
 family, often taking communion to the 
 housebound, also discussing baptisms, 
 marriages and comforting the bereaved.
 Many helpers clean the churches,      
 arrange the flowers, read Bible       
 lessons, ring the bells and tidy      
 churchyards so sharing the many       
 activities of the Christian community.</content>
