		<content> The rocks of the area abound in the   
 fossil remains of sea creatures which 
 lived in the mud or round the reefs,  
 and there are plenty of pieces in the 
 quarries in the hills.The silurian    
 period of rock building was first     
 studied in this area over a hundred   
 years ago. Names deriving from        
 Leintwardine district were given to   
 some species of fossil sea creatures. 
 Such fossils are{Conchidium knighti}  
 and {Monograptus leintwardinensis.}   
{Conchidium knighti}is a ribbed shell  
 which can be founed in quarries on    
 Mocktree, Shelderton and elsewhere.   
  "knighti" perpetuates, in Latin, the 
 name of one of the famous owners of   
 Downton Castle.                       
{Monograptus leintwardinensis}was named
 by Sir Roderick Murchison and         
 preserves the name of the village     
 where it was first found.             </content>
