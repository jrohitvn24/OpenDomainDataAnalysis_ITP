		<title>12CHILDRENS GAMES_STUCK_IN_MUD</title>
		<content> Any number of players may take part in
 this game. One person is 'it' and     
 he/she counts up to 10 whilst the rest
 run away. Then, the person who is 'it'
 tries to catch the others. When       
 someone is caught they are            
 'stuck_in_mud' and they have to stand 
 with their legs apart. If one of the  
 free players manages to dive through  
 the legs of a player who is           
 'stuck_in_mud' then the captured      
 player is free. If a player is caught 
 three times he/she is 'it'. Also a    
 player cannot be caught if they stop  
 under the legs of a captured player.
