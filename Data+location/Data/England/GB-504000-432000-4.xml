		<title>04  The Orchard Park Centre</title>
		<content> The Orchard Park Centre is the heart  
 of the Estate. It is more than that.  
 Lying on the southern edge of the     
 Estate where it abutts the older North
 Hull Estate, it has become heart for  
 the two{Council Housing Estates.} A   
 huge supermarket store and another    
 twelve or so smaller{convenience goods
 shops, plus an adjoining multi-purpose
 health clinic suggests a traders'     
 bonanza.  Especially as the estate    
 housing office is within the block    
 with no roads to cross.  On top of    
 this an open market sets up on a      
 nearby lorry park once a week.        
 Truely, it is thronged with shoppers  
 and their young children at any time  
 of any working day.  But, alas, in the
 evenings and at weekends the steel    
 shutters come down and it becomes the 
 haunt of young people with little or  
 nothing to do and nowhere to go.      </content>
