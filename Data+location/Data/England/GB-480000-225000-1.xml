		<title>01Swanbourne and Hoggeston</title>
		<content>     Swanbourne is situated at the     
westward end of a sand and gravel      
outcrop overlooking the lowlying heavy 
wetlands astride the Claydon Brook     
which is a major source of the Great   
Ouse.                                  
     The village is of Anglo-Saxon     
origin,having the outlines and street  
pattern of a major settlement of that  
period,recognisable in the surviving   
home closes of yeomen farmers who      
numbered 48 at the time of enclosure in
1763.                                  
     The name of the village may be    
derived from Suen,Earl of Essex,about  
1050,or from "the stream frequented by 
swans".                                
     Two km south,across arable fields 
and pasture lands,lies the small       
village of Hoggeston with the remains  
of its stockaded ring bank.
