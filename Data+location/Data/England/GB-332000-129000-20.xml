		<title>20Elvering</title>
		<content> Across the Atlatic Ocean in the Gulf  
 of Mexico eels lay their eggs in the  
 Sargasso Sea. When the elvers hatch   
 they cross the ocean and swim up the  
 Bristol Channel. Some find their way  
 into the river Parrett.They arrive in 
 the Spring and elvering begins.       
 They are only caught at certain times 
 as the river is tidal.The really keen 
 people will go out in the middle of   
 the night to catch elvers.Large hand  
 nets are used.                        
 Although some of the elvers are eaten 
 by local people, most are sold for    
 export to the continent where they are
 turned into smoked or jellied eels.   
 The elvering season is very short, but
 some people make very useful pocket   
 money from their efforts. Small boys  
 look forward to the day when they are 
 old enough to go elvering with their  
 fathers.                              </content>
