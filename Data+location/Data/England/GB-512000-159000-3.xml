 in 1885 on the Guildford to Waterloo  
 line. It is built in red brick. There 
 are two tracks each of which have     
 three rails, two for the wheels       
 and one carrying electricity. A foot  
 bridge connects the two platforms. The
 trains are very modern with sliding   
 doors. There are usually 2 trains each
 hour in each direction with more

 is from 7.30 to 9.00 and again in the 
 evening. It costs Â£1.90 to travel to  
 London and after 9.30 a Day Return

 costs about Â£800.00.The trains are    
 usually on time but they are          
 occasionally late. There is a car park
 at the station at 40p a day.
