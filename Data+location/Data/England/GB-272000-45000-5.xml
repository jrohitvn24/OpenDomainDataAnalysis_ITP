		<content> Most if the children who live in the  
 area go to the schools at Kingsbridge 
 or Loddiswell.                        
 There use to be a small school at     
 Goveton but that was closed in 1927.  
                                       
 My school is very nice because it is  
 fun to be there.I see all my friends  
 and learn lots of things.             
 We start at 9 o'clock in the morning  
 and finish at 3.30.I stay and have a  
 school lunch which saves my Mum having
 to pick me up at lunchtime.           
 We read a lot,do maths,problems and   
 different projects.                   
 We have a workshop where there is     
 science and art work to do.           
 There are ten teachers for our school 
 and there are about 320 children.They 
 are aged between 5 and 11.When we are 
 11 we will go to the big Comprehensive
 school.                               </content>
