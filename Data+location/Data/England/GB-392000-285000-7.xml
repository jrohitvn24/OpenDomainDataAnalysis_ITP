		<content> "Yo cor spake like we con, con ya?"   
 may seem like a foreign language but  
 it is normal in the Quarry Bank and   
 Brierley Hill area.  Or as known to   
 us, "Quarry Bonk and Brierley Bonk".  
                                       
 Most children in these areas have     
 three accents - one for the home, one 
 for school and one for when they are  
 out with their 'mates'.               
                                       
 The "posh" one for school, the not    
 quite so "posh" one for home, and the 
 "Quarry Bonker", language out.        
                                       
                                       
 The language can be understood except 
 for sayings like "'ers givin' me the  
 jedi" or "Yoda"  meaning "she's       
 staring at me, or "that's mass,"      
 meaning that's big.  The language has 
 changed over the years.               </content>
