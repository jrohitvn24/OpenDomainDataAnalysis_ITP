		<content> We, at Godalming Middle School have   
 greatly enjoyed our participation in  
 the Domesday Project. 71 children all 
 aged 11 have been involved to varying 
 degrees. We divided into small groups 
 of four and interviewed various people
 at the principal features we had      
 defined. As a result we found we      
 received on overwhelming response of  
 enthusiasm from all areas of the      
 community. We haved tried to portray a
 picture of life in our block as we    
 found it in June 1985 but no words can
 convey the dynamic community          
 atmosphere which prevails. The area   
 seems a very happy one probably       
 insulated to a degree from the current
 economic and social problems to be    
 found in other areas of the country.  
 We thank all those who have helped to 
 make our project a success.
