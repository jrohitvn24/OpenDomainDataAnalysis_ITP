		<title>18THE UNSWORTH DRAGON.</title>
		<content> Many years ago people thought a Dragon
 lived in a cave at Unsworth. It ate   
 local cattle and soon few remained.   
 Many heros tried to slay the Dragon,  
 but arrow, lance nor shot harmed it   
 until the appearence of Thomas        
 Unsworth. He made the Dragon so angry 
 that it roared, raising it's head     
 whereupon Thomas fired a dagger from a
 musket into its throat and killed the 
 Dragon.                               
 Since that time the area has been     
 called Unsworth in memory of Thomas   
 Unsworth. Local people interviewed in 
 1985 said that they believed the story
 although some said that "Dragon" could
 have been a wild Wolf, Bear or Wild   
 Boar.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
