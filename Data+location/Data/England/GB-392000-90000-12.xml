 build kitchens units, and also        
 build beds. Purbeck Kitchens employ   
{thirty-two people.}They make five     
 kitchens a day. They make kitchens    
 from wood such as Oak, Beech and Pine.
 The factory was built in 1982. Their  
 kitchens are sold as far as Bristol.  
 Their beds go abroad to Germany and   
 U.S.A. The kitchens are very modern.

 that they had eleven people working on
 the machines. They work all through   
 the year. They open at eight o'clock  
 and close at half past four. The wood 
 is called European white wood from    
 Finland and Swedan. There is 25 tonnes
 pressure on one machine. They have    
 two computers in the factory, which   
 are used to design the{rafters.}
