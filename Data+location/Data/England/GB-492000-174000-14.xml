		<title>14Church Schools of Windsor</title>
		<content>   The{Churches}pioneered the setting  
 up of schools in Windsor before there 
 was a{state system of Education.      
   The first properly organised school 
 was the{Royal Free Church of England  
{School}established in 1705 by public  
 subscription for 40 boys and 30 girls.
   The Roman Catholics set up a school 
 in 1830 and in 1841 the Congregational
 Church founded a British School, later
 taken over by the State.              
 In 1985 Windsor is unique in that it  
 still has a network of Church schools 
 both Anglican and Roman Catholic which
 provide a{Christian education}from    
 the age of 5 to 18.                   
 There are 6{First Schools}for 5 to 9  
 years, 3{Middle Schools}for 9 to 13   
 years and one{Upper School;}The       
{Princess Margaret Royal Free}for 13 to
 18 years which has evolved from the   
 Royal Free School of 1705.            </content>
