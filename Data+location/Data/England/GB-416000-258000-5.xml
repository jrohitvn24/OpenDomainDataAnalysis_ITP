		<content> children had gone to Smithfield.      
 Children came from a wide area and    
 enrolment fluctuated considerably     
 peaking at 120 with the post war      
 occupation of the RAF camps. The      
 original building is now a house and a
 new school was opened in 1962.  It has
 two classrooms, hall and large grounds
 with a staff of 22 including the      
 headteacher supported by a helper, a  
 cleaner in charge, a dinner lady and  
 secretarial help in the morning. Due  
 to the slump in the birthrate there   
 are now only 28 children on the roll  
 and the school is being reviewed with 
 a possibility of closure. The children
 would again go to Smithfield. The     
 school works closely with the         
 small schools at Hatton, Wolverton,   
 BAddesley, Clinton, Wroxall and       
 Wolverton
