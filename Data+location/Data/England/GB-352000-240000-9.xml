		<title>09ST MARY'S SCHOOL LUGWARDINE</title>
		<content>    St Mary's Roman Catholic High      
 School lies outside the City of       
 Hereford in the village of Lugwardine.
    Although formerly much of the      
 teaching and administration was       
 carried out by nuns from the          
 neighbouring convent (now relocated), 
 the school is now controlled by the   
 Hereford and Worcester County Council.
    The school admits children in the  
 11 to 16 age group from a wide area.  
 Many of the children are "bused" in.  
 The school achieves high academic     
 standards but it also enjoys a good   
 reputation with its remedial teaching 
 and the teaching of the deaf and      
 those with other handicaps.           
    A wide range of extra curricular   
 activities is offered, including      
 orchestra, choir, drama, swimming,    
 gymnastics, chess and computing. There
 are also excellent sport facilities.  </content>
