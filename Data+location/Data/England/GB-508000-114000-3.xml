		<content> Eating Habits                         
 ------------------------------------- 
 The most common eating pattern for    
 children in our school seems to be an 
 uncooked breakfast of cereal and/or   
 toast;sandwiches for lunch and a      
 cooked meal in the evening.For their  
  cooked meal,most people have fresh   
 meat with frozen or fresh vegtables.  
   Generally people seem to be more    
 aware of which foods are good for     
 them and health foods are becoming    
 quite popular.For example, more people
 eat brown bread rather than white and 
 the majority of children eat fruit    
 each day.Salads are popular in the    
 summer and nearly everyone drinks milk
 each day.                             
  People  are more adventurous too with
 Chinese and Indian food becoming much 
 more popular,whilst the English habit 
 of eating fish'n'chips is less popular</content>
