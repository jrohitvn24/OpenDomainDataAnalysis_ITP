There is an area designated for        
recreational purposes in the           
Staffordshire Southern area plan, but  
so far it has not been possible to     
purchase the necessary land. A small   
playing field to the side of the school
is for joint use, public and school,   
and is used on Summer evenings by young
people for games.                      
There is a very small amount of fishing
in the Little Aston Hall lake and Mill 
Farm pond.                             
For sports enthusiasts there are clubs 
for bowls, tennis and cricket in       
Summer, and table tennis in Winter.    
The Gardening Guild has a best kept    
village gardens competition annually.  
Little Aston has a first class golf    
course to the west of Little Aston     
Hall.
