		<content>  {Ravenstone,}mentioned in the        
 original Domesday Book is closely     
 linked with Packington. Although now  
 in Leicestershire, it was part of     
 Derbyshire as late as 1885. At that   
 time the major landowning family, the 
{FOSBROOKES,}resided at Shardlow in    
 Derbyshire.                           
   The church, built in 1323, has a    
 Rector, and is closely linked to a    
 group of 26 dwellings called 'The     
 Hospital', providing accommodation for
 widows and spinsters of the parish.   
 The building had its own Chaplain     
 (until 1950) and Chapel, where a      
 weekly service is still conducted.    
   In the North-West Leicestershire    
 District Council Structure Plan       
 (1971-1991) Ravenstone is classed as a
 "restraint" village.
