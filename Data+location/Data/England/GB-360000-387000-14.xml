		<title>14GOLDEN SQUARE</title>
		<content> Central to the re-vitalising of the   
 town centre has been the Â£23 million  
 golden square development.Shops are at
 ground level with goods delivery and  
 other servicing at the basement.Malls 
 provide under-cover and traffic-free  
 access to the shops and department    
 stores.This area is linked by a       
 covered bridge to a large multi-storey
 car park.The Golden Square is built   
 around the old Market place and the   
 Barley Mow, an ancient public house   
 dating from around 1560. This retains 
 the character of the old town together
 with the shops on the western side    
 which are built in the style of       
 buildings previously on the site. The 
 central square is covered by the old  
 Fishmarket in delicate wrought iron.  
 A sculpture of the Mad Hatter's Tea   
 Party was recently unveiled by the    
 Prince and Princess of Wales.         </content>
