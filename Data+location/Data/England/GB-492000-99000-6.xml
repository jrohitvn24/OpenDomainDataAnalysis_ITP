 is a dome on top.All the              
 buildings built by {Sir Richard       
{Hotham }are in the Georgian style.All 
 the buildings in Hothampton Crescent  
 are{Sir Richard Hotham's}master       
 pieces,including Chapel House just    
 across the road.There are lots of     
 flats,cottages and bungalows along the
 sea front for the retired people.Many 
 companies have built housing in the   
 area,these include Wimpey Homes,      
 Rookery farm houses and there is      
 a council estate which allows people  
 to pay rent or buy houses cheaply.Most
 buildings in Bognor are built of      
 bricks and some of stone.Most of the  
 houses are under 10 years of age,but  
 some are hundreds of years old.
