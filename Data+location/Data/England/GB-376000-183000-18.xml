		<title>18BIRDS IN HORTON</title>
		<content>   In my garage there is a robin's     
 nest.The nest had six eggs.Five eggs  
 hatched out of six.When the chicks    
 first hatched they had no feathers but
 they had a few on the top of their    
 heads.As they got bigger the feathers 
 covered their bodies.One morning we   
 went to look at them and they were    
 gone.In our barn we have a blackbird's
 nest but we cannot see the little ones
 because it is so high up.In our       
 chimney we have a crow's nest and a   
 swallow's nest is in the roof.   Kelly
   All sorts of birds come into my     
 garden and perch on the bird table.I  
 think that the blackbird,rooks and    
 starlings are greedy and take all the 
 food.They drive the little birds off  
 so that they don't have a chance. Once
 when I was putting some seeds in the  
 garden a bird came and hopped on to   
 the tray where I was working.    Sarah</content>
