		<title>18Tourism in the Wolfords</title>
		<content> The area included in this block is not
 on the usual tourist routes even      
 though it is in the fringe of the     
 Cotswolds, which has meant that the   
 three villages have remained unspoilt.
 The Fox and Hounds in Great Wolford,  
 however, attracts customers from a    
 long way to its bar and resturamt and 
 its new bed and breakfast             
 accommodation. The pub in Todenham    
 also offers accommodation, as do      
 several farmhouses in the block - and 
 the Post Office. There are also a few 
 cottages let on a holiday basis, which
 is not popular locally as it may mean 
 village houses being empty for some   
 of the year. There is also a small    
 caravan site in this area, and        
 occasionally a caravan club will spend
 the weekend either in a field or by   
 the village hall in Little Wolford.
