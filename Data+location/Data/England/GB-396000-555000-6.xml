		<title>06A Day In The Life Of Rachael</title>
		<content> My name is Rachael and I am 8. I get  
 up at 7:30 a.m., dress, go downstairs 
 and have Rice Krispies wth milk.      
 Afterwards I wash, comb my hair and   
 dress my doll. I feed our two cats,   
 then at 8:30 a.m. mum takes me to     
 school in he car. I have to open two  
 gates on our lane before we reach the 
 road. School starts at 9:00 a.m. with 
 assembly. I have lunch at 12:00 a.m.  
 then play with my friends in the      
 playground. School finishes at 3:15   
 p.m. and I travel home on a minibus.  
 Mum meets me and we take a short-cut  
 home across fields and through a wood.
 I play on my bike, feed my pony and   
 watch television until my dad comes   
 home at 5:30 p.m. when we have dinner.
 Mum takes me to Brownies at 6:30 p.m. 
 and my auntie brngs me home. I have   
 milk and biscuits and get ready for   
 bed at 9:00 p.m.                      </content>
