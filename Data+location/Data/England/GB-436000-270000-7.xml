		<title>07Ryton Heath Farm</title>
		<content> This 64 acre farm which dates from    
 1735 is reached by a minor road off   
 the main A423.The farm is a small     
 dairy unit with a herd of 40 cattle   
 mainly freisian.The farmer Mr.Thompson
 does not own a bull but uses the      
 artificial insemination method.The    
 farmer makes his own hay and silage to
 feed the cattle.His barn can hold 5000
 bales of hay and straw the latter he  
 buys in.Silage is made in heavy duty  
 polythene bags instead of a pit.The   
 milking parlour holds only two cows at
 a time.The farm produces up to 100    
 gallons of milk a day which is taken  
 to Leicester Co-op.Moles present a    
 problem to a grassland farmer causing 
 untold damage to machinery and silage 
 at hay time Mr. Thompson shoots them. 
 Disposing of the slurry is a problem  
 and under the 1985 act he has had to  
 build a ramp and pit.                 </content>
