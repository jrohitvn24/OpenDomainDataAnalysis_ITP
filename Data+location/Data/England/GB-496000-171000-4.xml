		<content>   Along the banks of the Thames lies  
 the historic site of Runnymede and    
 there are two monuments there which   
 are of particular interest to         
 visitors.                             
   The Magna Carta Memorial.This       
 commemorates the signing of the Magna 
 Carta by King John in 1215.           
   The Kennedy Memorial. This was      
 erected to the memory of President    
 J.F.Kennedy who was so tragically     
 assassinated and is obviously of      
 special interest to American          
 visitors to this area.                
   On the top of Coopers Hill lies the 
 Air Force Memorial which was built in 
 memory of all the British and         
 Commonwealth airmen who so valiantly  
 gave their lives in defence of freedom
 during the war.It is a place of       
 special peace and tranquility looking 
 down over the river.                  </content>
