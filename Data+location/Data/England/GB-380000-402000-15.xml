		<title>15ST MARY'S CHURCH PRESTWICH</title>
		<content> In the graveyard there are people     
 buried with very unusual names. These 
 include River Jordan,Radcliffe Bridge 
 and Alpha Omega. The oldest stone     
 belongs to the ten children of Thomas 
 Collier who all died,presumably in an 
 epidemic,{"twixt the 1st and 12th of  
{December 1641"                        
{}                                     
  The arches along the central nave are
 all different heights and the pillars 
 are not opposite each other.          
                                       
  The church possesses a peal of eight 
 bells,four being mentioned in the time
 of Edward VI 1552. The bells are      
 famous because at the end of the      
 Second World War in 1945 the peal; was
 broadcast by the BBC to celebrate the 
 occasion.                             
                                       
                                       </content>
