		<content> The survey showed a variety of        
 housing-home ownership,council        
 housing,private rental.The older      
 houses are built of stone or red      
 brick.Many of the houses are family   
 homes.Housing for the elderly is      
 provided by 1.The Old Hall-a private  
 nursing home.2.Toller Court-sheltered 
 accomodation.3.The Nests administered 
 by the  Vicar and two Church          
 wardens.                              
  One of the largest houses in         
 the village is Buckminster House.Once 
 owned by the Dean family, it is now a 
 children's home.                      
  There are few new houses being built 
 in the area. The Crown owns the       
 majority of the land which is rich    
 farmland and it is reluctant to sell  
 for building purposes.
