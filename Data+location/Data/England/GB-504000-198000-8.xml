		<content>{Sarratt School}has existed for over   
 100 years.  The original, all age, C  
 of E school was housed in a building  
 in Church Lane. The number on role    
 rose to 196 in 1976 with a staff of   
 11.From the 1960s a building was      
 constructed on a site behind the      
 village pond.7 years ago the original 
 building was sold as a private house  
 and a fully serviced, two classroom   
 unit was erected on the new site.     
 Children travel to school by coach    
 from the outlying hamlets as well as  
 walking and being ferried from all    
 parts of the village. The role at     
 present fluctuates between 85 and 95  
 and the total staff numbers 6.Smaller 
 families, expensive private housing in
 this 'Greenbelt' village and local    
 authority housing occupied by older   
 tenants have caused this decline.
