		<title>08EAST MERSEA'S SHOP</title>
		<content>   The village shop is the main        
 shop in East Mersea and it sells many 
 day to day foodstuffs and items,such  
 as meat,eggs,cheese,milk,bread and    
 papers.It sells some produce from a   
 nearby farm. Although the shop has    
 been there for some time it has been  
 under the present management for only 
 two years. The shop is popular and    
 well used by local residents and there
 are many more customers in the summer 
 from the nearby caravan site. Only    
 three people are employed there at    
 present but there are plans to expand 
 in the future and extend the shop so  
 that it could carry a greater stock.
