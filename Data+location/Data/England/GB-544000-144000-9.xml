 This business all started with a small
 garage with people asking the owner to
 store and deliver their goods. As the 
 business expanded, he bought two      
 lorries. Three years ago, the firm    
 moved to larger premises in           
 Edenbridge. There are now ten         
 employees, including six who drive    
 lorries and vans. They pack and       
 deliver such goods as :_ medical      
 goods, blood bottles, wheelchairs,    
 candles, lampshades, toys and books   
 and deliver to supermarkets, hospitals
 and restaraunts. They have three weeks
 holiday after working there for 12    
 months. After four years this is      
 increased to four weeks. The firm     
 closes over the Christmas break for up
 to ten days....by Sarah Galloway.
