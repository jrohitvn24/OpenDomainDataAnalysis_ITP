		<title>10Family Leisure in Harpenden</title>
		<content> Tiffany, our dog, takes my family for 
 long walks over the Common and into   
 the Park. With my friend I cycle along
 the Nicky Line (probably so called    
 because its Navvy builders wore       
 knickerbockers) where wild plants     
 grow. A lonely signal reminds us that 
 it was once a busy railway line from  
 Harpenden to Hemel Hempstead. Friday  
 is Beefeater night where we have fish,
 chips and ice-cream. My Mum and Dad   
 eat steak and drink wine. Dad likes   
 inventing computer games.  My Mum     
 plays squash, and the piano too.      
 Grandad's pride and joy is his        
 allotment where he grows prize veg..  
 My Mum likes singing in the Light     
 Operatic Soc. and Dad likes carving   
 wooden swords.   My brother's in      
 Scouts, my sister's in Guides and I'm 
 a Cub.
