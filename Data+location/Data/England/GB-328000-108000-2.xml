 The chalk uplands of{Snowdon Hill     
 drain through a series of springs     
 around the S. and E.of the block.     
 To the S.they drain to the R.Kit and  
 thence via the{R.Axe}to the{English   
{Channel.}To the E.streams run to the  
 R.Ile then the{R.Parrett}and          
 eventually to the{Bristol Channel.}   
 Being in the shadow of the first high 
 ground met by S.W.winds rainfall is   
 high and the area is known to be wet  
 and windy in winter.                  
 The rural area has some residual{Oak  
 woodland around ancient hedgerows but 
 many fields are now being amalgamated 
 for convenience of cereal harvesting. 
 Streams, where they exist, are clean  
 and provide some trout fishing but    
 care must be taken to prevent seepage 
 from silage and slurry lagoons.
