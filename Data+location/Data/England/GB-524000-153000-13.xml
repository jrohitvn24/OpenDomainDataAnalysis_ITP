		<title>13M.25: Some attitudes.</title>
		<content>     Most people think the new motorway
 is a{good idea.}Some reasons are that 
 they will be able to get to places    
 much more quickly and there will be   
 fewer traffic jams on the roads.      
 There may be a few traffic jams on the
 motorway but not as many. It will also
 create{employment}for the people who  
 are paid to build the motorway.       
     Some reasons why the motorway is  
 bad are that it will destroy the{wild 
{life,}both the plants and animals, and
 spoil the landscape. There may be     
{danger}if children go down to the main
 road, and there may be more accidents,
 because cars will be travelling much  
 faster than on smaller roads.         
     Generally the attitude of the     
 locals is that it will greatly improve
 transport links in the area, and will 
 take a lot of the traffic off the busy
{A217,}running through Kingswood.      </content>
