		<content>   The state schools in this area are  
{Reydon Infants, Southwold Primary,    
{Reydon High.}Private schools are      
{Eversley House, St George's and St    
{Felix.}This area is unlike most of    
 Suffolk: it does not have a primary,  
 middle and secondary school system    
 because it has a small population.    
 Pupils go from Reydon Infants to      
 Southwold Primary and then into Reydon
 High. Sixth formers go to Beccles or  
 Lowestoft.                            
  Children follow basic subjects at    
 primary school. Reydon High has only  
{300}pupils{11_16}but it offers a wide 
 variety of subjects at 'O'level, 16+  
 and C.S.E. St Felix is a boarding_    
 school with some day_girls.There are  
 450 pupils and they study 'O'levels,  
 C.S.E. and 'A'levels.
