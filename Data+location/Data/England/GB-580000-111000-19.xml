		<title>19The Railway At Ore</title>
		<content>              The Hastings to Ashford  
 Railway runs through our squares.It   
 was built about 1849/50.One of the    
 main works on this line was the Ore   
 tunnel which is three quarters of a   
 mile long.It begins to the west of    
 Frederick Road and ends at Coghurst   
 Gateway.The deepest shaft was 204 ft  
 deep.It has a red -brick structure on 
 top and can still be seen off the main
 road just past Frederick Road in Simes
 Ground.                               
         The men building the railway  
 were called "navvies" and those  in   
 charge of them were called "gangers." 
 The gangers chose badly behaved       
 drunken men to work on the railway    
 line,and many accidents occurred.Also 
 to the annoyance of the church the men
 were encouraged to work on Sundays.
