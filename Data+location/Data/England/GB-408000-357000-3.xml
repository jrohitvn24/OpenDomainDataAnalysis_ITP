		<content>     There are two schools in Warslow, 
a First School and a Middle School.    
Both schools are housed in the same    
building, which was first built and    
opened in 1958 as a Secondary School.  
It was changed into a Middle School in 
1979 and the First School moved into   
the building in September 1980.        
     In July 1985 there were 78 pupils 
in the Middle School with 8 full-time  
equivalent teachers.  The number of    
pupils in the school is remaining      
steady.                                
     In July 1985 there were 69 pupils 
in the First School with 2.5 teachers. 
Here the number of pupils is rising.   
     Most of the pupils travel to      
school by bus from the surrounding     
villages.  They come from Flash,       
Longnor, Sheen, Hulme End,             
Alstonefield, Wetton, Butterton and    
Onecote.                               </content>
