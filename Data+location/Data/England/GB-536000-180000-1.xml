		<title>01Tower Hamlets</title>
		<content> ur 4 x 3 km square falls largely in an
 rea of London called Tower Hamlets.The
3 easternmost squares cross into Newham
Our square is mainly residential but is
also known for 'homework'-people work  
at home on garments etc which are then 
taken to factories for completion.There
has been alot of rebuilding since the  
2nd World War but this is now in need  
of substancial repair.There is a mix of
housing types from Georgian to modern. 
The 4 southernmost squares cross into  
the Enterprise Zone of London Docklands
which may create more jobs in an area  
which has lost many in recent years due
to dock closures.Transport services are
adequate but could be geared more to   
the needs of the local people.The area 
is multi-cultural.It is also one of the
poorest boroughs in London.
