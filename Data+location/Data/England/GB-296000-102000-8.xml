		<content> He makes a variety of shaped pots     
 decorated by making the wet clay and  
 colouring them with coloured glaze    
 made from powered glass. He usually   
 glazes all his work before it's fired,
 it gets fired twice so that it is     
 water_proofed.                        
    He buys about 500Kg of clay a year 
 which costs him about Â£300. He sells  
 for approx. Â£500. He makes a profit of
 Â£200 a year. Mr Bickford hopes to     
 expand his business soon.
