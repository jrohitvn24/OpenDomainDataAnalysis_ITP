		<content>   The area contains two major commun- 
 ities;{Isfield}village which is a     
 linear development and{Ridgewood}which
 is effectively a suburb of Uckfield.  
 Many people live in individual houses 
 or small clusters scattered throughout
 the countryside. The parish of{Little 
{Horsted}has no nucleated settlement   
 but has quite a large population of   
 199 (1981 Census Returns).            
   The local{relief}consists of undu-  
 lating sandstone ridges. The Church at
 Little Horsted and the settlement at  
 Ridgewood stand on the summits of two 
 of these ridges. The settlements com- 
 mand{attractive views}of the surround-
 ing landscape which is characterised  
 by a patchwork of hedges,woodland and 
 fields. In the distance there is the  
 splendid panorama of the{South Downs  
 extending from Wilmington in the East 
 to Chanctonbury Ring in the West.     </content>
