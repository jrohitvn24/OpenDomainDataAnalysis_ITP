		<title>05HAIL WESTON -</title>
		<content> Hail Weston lies to the West of Little
 Paxton and the A1.The village stands  
 high, the church steeple of St. Neots 
 Church seems to stand level with the  
 villages main street.                 
  Mr.Jones the chairman of the Hail    
 Weston Parish Council arranged for us 
 to talk to Mrs.Coward,the             
 vice-chairman and Mr.J.Arnold.These   
 respected residents of long standing  
 answered our questions and gave us a  
 lot of interesting information.       
  The village has two public houses and
 when we did our walk around to survey 
 the area  our teacher arranged for us 
 to have a sandwich lunch in the Crown 
 pubs garden.We had a glass of lemonade
 each and Sir had a shandy with the two
 ladies who came with us.The landlord  
 gave us discount but the barmaid did  
 not think much of pouring out         
 twentysix glasses of pop .            </content>
