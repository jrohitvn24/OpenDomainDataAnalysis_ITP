		<title>13Pocket money in 1985</title>
		<content> 48 children aged 10 talked about the  
{amount}of pocket money they were given
 each.13 received less than Â£1.00      
      16 got between Â£1.00 &amp; Â£1.50     
      8 got between Â£1.50 &amp; Â£2.00      
      11 received Â£2.00 or more.       
 Our teacher was surprised at how much 
 money some children had.              
 We then discussed how they{spent}it.  
 Most children (42) saved money either 
 in a bank or for something special.We 
 mostly paid for subs at brownies and  
 cubs (25p), and helped towards buying 
 clothes (sandals Â£7.99, skirt Â£5.99,  
 tee-shirt Â£2.50).                     
 Some children spent more than half    
 their pocket money on sweets.July 1985
 prices...mint chews 19p, peanuts 16p, 
 chewing gum 10p, choc-ice 25p.        
 Most children said their pocket money 
 went up on their birthdays, and they  
 had extra for Christmas.              </content>
