		<title>10Seabrook's Crisp Factory</title>
		<content>    The{Seabrook factory}is situated in
 an old village called Allerton, on the
 outskirts of Bradford. The factory is 
 on a main road which is a steep hill. 
 The{workers}wear overalls and hats for
 hygene purposes.{Women}work on the    
 production line while the{men}are     
 managers and mechanics.               
   The{potatoes}used have to be round  
 and most of them come from down south.
 They use three quarters of a ton of   
 potatoes a day.  First, the potatoes  
 are washed, then peeled, cut, straight
 or crinkle then blanched. They are    
 dried then fried in cotton seed oil.  
{Flavouring}is added and the crisps are
 put into packets and these are packed 
 into boxes. These are distributed east
 and west. The factory is noisy and    
 smelly causing the neighbours to      
 complain.
