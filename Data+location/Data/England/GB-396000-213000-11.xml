		<content> We went to the Post Office at Coberley
 to see Peter Grimshaw. He said that   
 the post office was 107 years old and 
 he showed us the original notice that 
 used to be put in the window. It was  
 written in quill pen. There was an old
 cabinet that was 80 years old and he  
 showed us another valuable thing which
 was the scales. They were 100 years   
 old with most of the original weights.
 He siad that one of the weights was   
 missing. It had been stolen by a child
 who had come in to buy some sweets    
 some time ago. He had a new one to    
 replace it which was a modern one. It 
 looked odd with the old ones. The post
 office has always been run by Mr.     
 Grimshaw's family. He likes the old   
 things in the shop and wants to keep  
 the old character of the shop. He     
 sells bottles of pop, sweets, bread   
 that you have to order from the bakers</content>
