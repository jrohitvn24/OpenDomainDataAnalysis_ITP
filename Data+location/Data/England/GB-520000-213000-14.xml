		<title>14SCHOOL DAY - PART TWO</title>
		<content> At 12.10 I meet my friend Tracy and we
 go to dinner together.  When we have  
 finished we meet all our other friends
 outside and talk until the bell goes  
 at 1.15.  In the afternoon we have    
 more lessons of French and Geography. 
 At 4 pm we go home.  I walk home with 
 Tracy and arrive at my house at about 
 4.35. If I have any homework I do     
 that, and then listen to records in my
 room.  I have tea at about 6 o'clock. 
 At about 6.15 pm I somtimes get ready 
 to go to the Campus Disco. I meet my  
 friends there.  The disco is from 7.00
 pm to 10.00 pm.  When the disco has   
 finished my dad picks me and my       
 brother up from the Campus.  We go    
 home and I have something to eat and  
 drink and get into bed eventually at  
 about 10.40 pm.
