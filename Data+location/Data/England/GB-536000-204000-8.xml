		<content> Some arable farmers in the area hae   
 also turned some fields to "cash      
 summer crops" such as strawberries    
 where the public are invited to pick  
 their own. This is far cheaper for the
 public, less outlay for the farmer and
 a better return for him. Such a field 
 can be found in the Southern part of  
 the area.                             
 The other major land use ie gravel    
 extraction, has been carried out for a
 number of years in this area by       
 Redland Gravel Company, and throughout
 the centre of our area evidence of    
 this extraction can be seen, such as  
 the artificial lakes. However, as part
 of the Lee Valley Park policy, the    
 lakes have been turned into leisure   
 facilities when extraction has been   
 completed - frequently on our visits  
 people could be seen whiling away the 
 time fishing in these man-made lakes. </content>
