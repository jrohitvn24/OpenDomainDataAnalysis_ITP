		<content>   Clifton on Dunsmore (which takes its
 name from the hill "clive" meaning    
 cliff)was mentioned in the first      
 Domesday survey of 1087.The different 
 architectural styles of the houses    
 show how the village has developed    
 over the last 900 years. The greatest 
 expansion being in the last 150 years,
 however, with the building of the     
 canal and railway,and the development 
 of Rugby as an industrial area.       
   From the church tower of Saint Mary 
 The Virgin,one can see into three     
 counties-Warwickshire,Leicestershire  
 and Northhamptonshire.                
   At the last national census taken in
 1981,there were 1332 people living in 
 Clifton.In 1885 there were 379        
 inhabitants.
