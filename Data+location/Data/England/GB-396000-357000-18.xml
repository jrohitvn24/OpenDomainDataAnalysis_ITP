BECAUSE I HAVE TO TRAVEL QUITE A       
DISTANCE TO SCHOOL WHEN IT IS LUNCHTIME
I STAY AT SCHOOL TO EAT MY LUNCH. AS DO
MOST OF THE OTHER CHILDREN WHO TRAVEL  
TO SCHOOL BY SCHOOL BUS.               
AT OUR SCHOOL WE HAVE A CHOICE OF      
EITHER BRINGING IN SANDWICHES TO EAT OR
BUYING A SCHOOL DINNER. WHATEVER YOU   
CHOOSE TO DO FOOD HAS TO BE EATEN IN   
THE HALL.                              
THE DINNERS AT OUR SCHOOL ARE VERY GOOD
BECAUSE YOU CAN CHOOSE WHAT YOU WANT   
FROM QUITE A VARIETY OF FOODS.         
YESTERDAY I HAD BEEFBURGERS, CHIPS,    
CARROTS AND GRAVY. FOR PUDDING I HAD   
FRUIT FLAN AND CUSTARD. I COULD HAVE   
HAD STEAK AND KIDNEY PIE OR FISH       
FINGERS OR RAVIOLI ALL WITH A SELECTION
OF VEGETABLES. WE ALSO HAVE A SALAD BAR
WHERE THERE IS FRESH LETTUCE, TOMOTOES 
AND OTHER SALAD FOODS.                 </content>
