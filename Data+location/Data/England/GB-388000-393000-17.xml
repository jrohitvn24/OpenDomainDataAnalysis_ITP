		<title>17BIRD LIFE IN TAME VALLEY</title>
		<content> The Tame valley is the correct habitat
 for avariety of birds. There are      
 plenty of trees for resting and long  
 grass where they can mate and hide    
 their eggs.                           
 There are many brightly coloured birds
 such as wagtails and kingfishers.As   
 well as the common birds such as      
 ;crows and black headed gulls there   
 are rare birds.There is abird that has
 blown in from the coast called the    
 arctic skua.Another rare bird is the  
 butcher bird.It's usually found near  
 railings because they hunt small      
 rodents and stick them on the spikes  
 of barbed wire.They do this to store  
 food for their young.                 
 Some of the migrating birds found in  
 the valley are blackcap,willowwarbler 
 and swallow
