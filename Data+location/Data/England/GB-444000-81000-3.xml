		<content> Mixed farming economy with relatively 
 large farms. Arable land is mainly    
 improved pasture for dairy and beef   
 herds and cereals like wheat and      
 barley, vegetables especially potatoes
 and peas. The northerly farms include 
 Downland rough pasture for sheep. Most
 of these farms include small disused  
 chalk pits. Everywhere there are small
 mainly deciduous copses. Most farms   
 are run by families. There are 2      
 nurseries/market gardens; a small one 
 near Yafford, a large one at          
 Northcourt farm. There is a trout farm
 at Yafford. Except where there are    
 manor estates the farm houses are     
 small, stone-built structures with    
 clay tile roofs but some roofs are    
 slate or even corrugated iron.
