		<content> Monday morning at half past seven my  
 daddy comes in and wakes me up ready  
 for school. I get my school clothes   
 out of the wardrobe, wash and dress.  
 After that I make my bed rush         
 downstairs and gobble breakfast.      
 After that I wash up then see to my   
 ducks which means I have to change    
 their hay, feed them and fill the pond
 up with water. I shout to my big      
 sister "start getting your coat and   
 shoes on", and off we go to school.   
 When we arrive I play a game with my  
 friend named Hayley. At 9 a.m. school 
 starts. Playtime is from 10.15 to     
 10.30a.m.  more games and fun with    
 other friends.Science Art or Domesday 
 work up to lunchtime. We have a       
 cafeteria system at school, chips with
 everything is ace or lush(best).After 
 school ends at 3.35 p.m. I have time  
 to go roller booting. Homework-ugh!   </content>
