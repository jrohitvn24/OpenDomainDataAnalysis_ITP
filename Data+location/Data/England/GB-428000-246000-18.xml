		<content> Transport is vitally important in     
 rural area.The majority of households 
 have a car but this does not solve the
 transport problems for everone.       
 Children ,young adults and the aged,in
 particular ,rely on bus services.     
 Pillerton Priors and Pillerton Hersey 
 have 3 bus sevices into Stratford upon
 avon and three return on six days of  
 the week provided by the Midland Red  
 Co.There is an early morning and early
 evening service provided by a private 
 Co. from Oxhill mainly for those      
 working in Stratford upon avon.The    
 same Co.operates a free service to and
 from Moreton in Marsh on Tuesdays     
 (Market Day).Children in our area are 
 provided with transport to school     
 providing they live more than two     
 miles from school.children less than  
 this distance can be concessionary    
 passengers but parents must pay.      </content>
