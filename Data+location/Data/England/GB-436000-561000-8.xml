		<title>08TILESHEDS SIGNALBOX,E.BOLDON</title>
		<content> Bordering the southwest corner of the 
 Whiteleas Estate is the main          
 Sunderland - Newcastle railway line.  
 Tileshed Lane crossing is controlled  
 by{Tilesheds Signal Box}and Boldon    
 level crossing is automatically       
 controlled by the trains. The signal  
 box at Tilesheds,which is owned by    
 British Rail controls 2000 yards of   
 track and is manned 24 hours a day by 
 signalmen who work 8 hour shifts.     
 The signals on the line are operated  
 by hand levers. However within the    
 next 10 years, British Rail say the   
 box will be demolished and run by     
 computer from elsewhere.              
 On average, 7 local trains travel     
 along the line every hour. The 625    
 London Express passes twice daily.    
 Opposite the signal box stand 6{      
{railway cottages,}built 100 years ago.
