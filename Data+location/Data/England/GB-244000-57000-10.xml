		<title>10BULL POINT PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content> My topic is school. I like school. It 
 is good especially with Mr. Partridge 
 because he does not give us hard work 
 all the time. I like drawing the      
 school badge it is colourful and I    
 enjoy it. My favorite things in school
 are maths,spelling,reading and playing
 on the computer. It is fun.           
                                       
 I also like writing and swimming. When
 I come in from play I go straight on  
 to my spelling and when I finish my   
 spelling I do my reading. Reading is a
 story that you read and look at the   
 pictures. And then Sir tells us to do 
 something. Then we do some work and   
 then it is dinner time. We have our   
 dinner and then we play. The whistle  
 goes and we go into class get into our
 swimming gear and go into the swimming
 pool and we swim then get dressed.
