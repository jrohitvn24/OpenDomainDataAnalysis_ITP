 The major concerns in Edington are the
 young,old and unemployed. Whilst very 
 young,the children are catered for by 
 school,home,country-side,Playfield,   
 Brownies and Cubs.The trouble starts  
 with the teenagers,many needing the   
 type of entertainment only found in   
 larger towns.Public transport is      
 inadequate and expensive,and often    
 parents do not have the time, or money
 to act as a taxi service!There is no  
 Youth Club, and through boredom,a few 
 are even law breaking.                
          The community works hard for 
 the elderly.A Friendly Circle meets   
 each week,and has regular outings.    
 There is a day centre with transport  
 provided,in Bratton,1 mile away.A     
 Good Neighbour scheme not only checks 
 upon welfare,but is also available for
 more urgent transport problems.       </content>
