		<title>13CHURCHES AND CHAPELS</title>
		<content> St.Roberts Roman Catholic Church was  
 built in 1877 and is a shrine to local
 and national English martyrs.Relics of
 a martyred 16th century priest are on 
 display in a side altar.20 stained    
 glass windows and much solid oak rails
 and panelling beautify the church for 
 its approximately 100 worshippers.    
  The present Methodist Chapel was     
 built in 1929 and is in Chapel Lane   
 away from all the houses.The previous 
 building known as Ranters included a  
 stable  as people came by horse.It is 
 served by a circuit ministry.         
  There is no Church of England in     
 Catforth, the area being divided      
 between the parishes of Woodplumpton  
 and Inskip, the latter being St.      
 Peter's Church. There is also a parish
 church at Treales. A Baptist chapel is
 also to be found in Inskip.
