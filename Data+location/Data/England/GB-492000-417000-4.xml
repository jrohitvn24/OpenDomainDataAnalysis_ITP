		<title>04LAW AND ORDER IN WINTERTON 2</title>
		<content> The policeman does most of his work by
 car because he has to stay in radio   
 contact with headquarters. He has     
 little time to walk. If he got a call 
 from his walkie talkie when there had 
 been an accident or something he would
 have to run all the way back to his   
 car. In Winterton there is little     
 truancy. Litter is a problem in some  
 places. Nearby villages like Roxby are
 partolled by the Winterton police     
 station as well. The policeman found  
 Winterton people very friendly and    
 ready to talk. He thought it was      
 better than the large cities. Law and 
 order is helped by parents who keep   
 children under control. Police have   
 club leaders help as well. Schools    
 have few of the discipline problems of
 major towns.
