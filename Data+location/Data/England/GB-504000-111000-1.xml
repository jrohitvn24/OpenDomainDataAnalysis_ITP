		<title>01TELEPHONES AMBERLEY  RACKHAM</title>
		<content>  Most houses have a telephone. There  
 is one  public telephone not in the   
 area at Rackham., Isolated houses rely
 on the telephone for contact with     
 other people the farm houses in this  
 area have only one or two cottages    
 near them. Kithurst Farm is at the end
 of a two mile lane.                   
 There are four letter boxes in this   
 area, but post is delivered twice a   
 day by postmen in vans from Arundel.  
 There are two collections a day from  
 the letter boxes. The postmen will    
 sometimes take your letter and post   
 it if you are a long way from a letter
 box.                                  
 Newspapers are not delivered, but many
 isolated communities arrange that     
 one person collects the newspaper and 
 either delivers them or they are      
 collected by individuals from one     
 central point.                        </content>
