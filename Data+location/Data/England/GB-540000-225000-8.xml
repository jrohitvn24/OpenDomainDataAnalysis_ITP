		<title>08HIDDEN AWAY HOUSING</title>
		<content>  This is a remote area with a tiny    
 village centre and many isolted houses
 some hidden away and almost           
 inaccessible. Many are very old and   
 on the whole they are in immaculate   
 condition and beautifully modernised. 
 There are a few small cottages that   
 are in poor condition. A few modern   
 houses have been built and on the     
 whole they blend in with the          
 surrounding countryside.              
  In the immediate village area about  
 half the houses were originally built 
 by the council for rent although some 
 of them have now been bought by their 
 occupants.                            
  As it is difficult to get planning   
 permission for new buildings some     
 people convert old barns or very old  
 buildings into houses.
