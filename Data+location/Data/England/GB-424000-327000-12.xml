		<title>12MODERN HOUSING IN EGGINTON</title>
		<content> My house is seven years old. We have  
 lived in it for a year and a half. It 
 is made of brick and tiles.It is      
 heated by gas. It has got two floors. 
 It is joined up by its garage to      
 another garage. We have got two       
 gardens. In the front garden there is 
 a small patch with plants in. That is 
 mine. Inside the house when you are in
 the door you see on the left the      
 cloakroom. When you come out of there,
 face forward and there is another     
 door. Go through that and the kitchen 
 is through there.go forward and you   
 will see swinging doors like a bar in 
 the wild west and a sink and fridge   
 and the microwave and breakfast bar.  
 Go back the way you came and you will 
 come to the brown door.
