		<content> Trees have always been of the greatest
 importance at Wykeham, both in terms  
 of forestrey and making the area more 
 pleasent.With a private house set in  
 landscaped parkland and accompanying  
 farms and woodland tree production has
 been a continuous process for many    
 years. The Nursery Book goes back to  
 1862. Extra heavy trees for amenity   
 have been grown in association with   
 Exbury Trees 1973. They have developed
 ablend of practical experiance and    
 modern techniques in the production of
 trees of the highest quality. In      
 1978 they increased their plantings in
 response to the views of customers    
 from Southern England to the north of 
 Scotland who preferred to plant trees 
 grown in northern locations.
