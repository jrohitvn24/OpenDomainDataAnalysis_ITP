		<title>04SHOPPING IN STRATTON</title>
		<content> Our area lacks shopping facilities.   
 There are only{33 shops}in the 12     
 sq km area catering for a population  
 of{23 000.}There is no shopping       
 centre, simply 3 small blocks of shops
 at{Beechcroft Road, Grange Drive and  
{lower Ermin St.}There are larger      
 shopping centres nearby at{Gorse Hill 
 and{Stratton Crossroads,}but even so  
 regular trips have to be made across  
 town to the central shopping centre or
 even to the West Swindon centre. The  
 lack of adequate shops has been a     
 source of complaint in our area for   
 many years; envious eyes have been    
 cast in the direction of West Swindon 
 as increasingly comprehensive         
 facilities have been built there. At  
 last, in March 1985, planning approval
 was given for the construction of a   
{superstore}beside the A4311 road      
 opposite the Crest Motel.             </content>
