		<content>   Along the valley bottom in the      
 richer alluvium, rotation of crops    
 like wheat and barley takes place with
 roots such as sugar beet and potatoes.
 On the less extreme slopes there is   
 orchard, including commercial cider   
 apples grown for{Bulmers.}A little    
 cherry growing continues from trees   
 now fifty years old and there is some 
 commercial blackcurrant growing.      
   On the flatter ground beef cattle   
 are fattened and higher up sheep and  
 store cattle, mainly Hereford cross   
 with some Charolais, are pastured     
 and calves reared; there is also one  
 dairy unit. Sheep are largely Suffolk 
 cross, Welsh half-bred or Clun.       
   Deep litter battery production takes
 place at{Church Farm}, rearing 2000   
 turkeys for the Christmas market and  
 in addition 2000 chickens on contract 
 four times a year.                    </content>
