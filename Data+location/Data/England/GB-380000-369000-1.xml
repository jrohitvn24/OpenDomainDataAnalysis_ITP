		<content>  This block is situated in the centre 
 of Cheshire and the land is mainly    
 used for dairy farming. It is a flat  
 area, part of what is known as the    
{Cheshire Plain.}The housing is        
 scattered and there are only two      
 villages of any size in this block    
{Lower Withington}and part of          
{Siddington.                           
 To the north west corner of the block 
 there is a large{sand quarrying       
 operation which makes quite an impact 
 on the environment, both while there  
 is active quarrying and later when the
 excavation is allowed to fill with    
 water.                                
  There are several small{hamlets      
 scattered within the block, such      
 as Withington Green, Smiths Green,    
 Windyharbour and Siddington Heath.
