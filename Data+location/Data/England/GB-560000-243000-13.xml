 On the next few pages we have tried to
 describe some of the activities _     
 clubs and societies, which are active 
 in the villages.                      
{1.The Bowls Club.                     
 In 1934 people were playing bowls on  
 the Pond Farm lawn.In 1936 they moved 
 up to the Mens Club.After a while Mr. 
 Fred Chapman leased them a piece of   
 his land to use and an excellent      
 bowling green was built. There is now 
 a club house.This year it is going to 
 be extended, because there are more   
 members.To join costs Â£10 for the     
 season.This year they have started to 
 wear white tops  and grey skirts as   
 uniform.Mrs Norden use to take the    
 ladies team.Cambridgeshire and Steeple
 Bumpstead played against each other   
 and raised Â£50 to buy mats recently.  
 The Club is a very successful one.    </content>
