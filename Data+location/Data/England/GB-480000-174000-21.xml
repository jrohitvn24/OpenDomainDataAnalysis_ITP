<title>21Shurlock Row Village 2011</title>
<content>

Since 1986, Shurlock Row has largely remained unchanged in size. The village has overcome the threat of a motorway service station (since built at Reading) to stay as a quiet oasis in the Thames Valley commuter belt. Aside from a medium sized car repair business, there is no longer a retail presence in the village, the post office, general store and butchers all having closed. The Royal Oak pub has also closed and is now pending conversion into a residential property. The White Hart pub was sold by the brewery in 2009 to a consortium of villagers, who now run the premises as the "Shurlock Inn", attracting customers from well beyond the village. The church is no longer functioning as a place of worship and is now a private dwelling.   &lt;br />
