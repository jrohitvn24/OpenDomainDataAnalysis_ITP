		<title>19West Ashby Henge.</title>
		<content> One km. SE of the Bronze Age barrow   
 lies a Henge monument, normally       
 defined as a circular area enclosed by
 a bank with an external ditch broken  
 by one or more entrances. It is a     
 class II henge-sited close to water,  
 having two entrances and being more   
 oval than circular. It lies 150m. east
 of the Bain on the edge of the flood  
 plainon glacial sands and gravels, at 
 a height of 40 O.D.It is about 25m. in
 diameter with 2 opposite entrances.   
 The aerial photograph shows no sign of
 a bank, but the ditch is encircled by 
 a series of pits, at least 24, which  
 may have accomodated wooden posts or  
 perhaps upright stones. There are no  
 visible remains on the ground as the  
 monument is ploughed out. There are   
 less than 100 known henges in the     
 country &amp; it is the one unequivocal   
 identification in Lincs. to date.     </content>
