		<content> There are no great historic houses, no
 statues, no magnificent gardens to    
 view, this is an area of natural      
 interest where people can have a quiet
 time getting back to nature. Picnics  
 and walks and drives down narrow Devon
 lanes with high hedges on both sides  
 are the reason people visit the area. 
 Many people simply drive the road from
 Colyton to Honiton regularly and      
 become completely oblivious to the    
 surrounding beauty. On the other hand 
 the area appears to be attracting more
 visitors each year simply to spend a  
 few days living on the farm and       
 enjoying the simple uncomplicated     
 life.
