		<title>12Work in a Glasshouse.</title>
		<content> In Winter we grow a lot of lettuce and
 a few tomatoes. Cucumbers and tomatoes
 need a lot of sun and hot weather so  
 the Summer is the best time to grow   
 them. In Winter we start to grow small
 cucumbers and tomato plants ready for 
 planting in the glasshouses.          
  At this glasshouse my job is to pick 
 tomatoes then put them in a large     
 green machine which sorts them into   
 different sizes. I then put them into 
 boxes ready to be sent to the shops.  
 Summertime is the worst time of the   
 year to be working under glass. It    
 gets very hot and stuffy. We work long
 hours, 7.30am to 8pm. We even work on 
 Saturday morning. I wear rubber gloves
 when picking tomatoes or my hands turn
 a funny green."
