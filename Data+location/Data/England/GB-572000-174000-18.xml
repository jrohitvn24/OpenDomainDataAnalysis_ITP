Like many areas there are continuing   
local issues that provide opportunities
for debate and involvement. These may  
range from disappearing footpaths and  
public rights of way to new estate     
developments.There are old,flooded and 
disused chalk quarries left now as a   
landmark, fenced and abandoned, too    
dangerous for children to go near. Bus 
routes,once providing services through 
the area,have become mere skeletons by 
comparison.Youngsters seek leisure     
facilities beyond the local park and   
are frustrated by lack of              
opportunities.Farmers anxious to       
maximise their crop yield use aerial   
spraying and controlled stubble        
burning.The river defences are built up
as part of the Thames protection scheme
to safeguard farmland and homes.
