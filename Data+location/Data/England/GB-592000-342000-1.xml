		<title>01EAST OF WELLS-NEXT-THE-SEA</title>
		<content>This area lies to the East of          
Wells-next-the-Sea but includes the    
edge of the residential area of the    
town,some limited industrial           
development on te site of the old      
railway station and goods yard and the 
area of the East Quay.                 
The East Quay is the base for the Whelk
fishing boats and the 'houses' where   
the whelks are cooked. Also located    
here is the Wells Sailing Club which is
the main centre in the United Kingdom  
for the International 12 Square Metre  
Sharpie sailing dinghy.                
The rural area can be divided into     
three parts;the saltmarsh with         
opportunities for bird watching and    
wildfowling ,the arable farming land   
with crops of barley,sugar beet and    
field vegtables and some grazing land  
in the valley bottoms.
