		<title>06HIGHFIELDS VILLAGE</title>
		<content>    There is just one road entering    
{Highfields village}which stands       
 between the Old Great North Road and  
 the Roman Ridge footpath.             
   {Highfields}is a mining village     
 therefore all the houses are pit      
 houses. As you come into the village  
 there is a bookmakers to the right and
 a general store to the left. The road 
 divides at the war memorial clock.    
    The two roads are roughly 850m long
 and the village is shaped like a thin 
 isosceles triangle. The Miners Welfare
 Club and the village school both lie  
 between the two roads. Some of the    
 houses face out into the fields with  
 their backs into the street. Some were
 having brick extensions built or were 
 being modernised. Most of them have   
 asphalt gardens and paths. The whole  
 village is surrounded by an iron      
 railing.                              </content>
