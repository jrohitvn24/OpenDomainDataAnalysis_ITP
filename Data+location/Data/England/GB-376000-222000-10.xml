		<title>10FARMING AND RURAL LIFE</title>
		<content> Mixed Farming is predominant in the   
 area. Arable crops include barley,    
 wheat, potatoes, silage, hay and oil  
 seed rape. Court Farm has pedigree    
 herds of Jersey Cattle and Long Horn _
 the latter breed was common in the    
 18th century and is now becoming more 
 popular. There is also a well known   
 stud farm at Limbury Stud             
 specialising in the production of     
 event horses. Horse and Pony Shows    
 take place at Limbury and Tweenhills. 
 P. Western at Groveside produces      
 fences for Horse Shows. Foxes are     
 hunted by Ledbury, and Cotswold Vale  
 Hunts from November _ March each      
 year. Hares are hunted by Leadon Vale 
 Basset Hounds. Horticulture is also   
 important, with six nurseries         
 specialising in different plants e.g. 
 tomatoes, lettuces, alpines and       
 annuals.                              </content>
