		<content> Nettleham pop.3480 lies in a valley   
 beside the beck,between A46 and A158  
 This position,north of Lincoln,makes  
 it popular with commuters.A nucleus   
 of C18th+19th cottages around the     
 church has increased with modern      
 estates.Important in Mediaeval times, 
 with its Bishop's Manor,whose ruins   
 remain,it is once more the centre for 
 the surrounding district.Scothern pop.
 710 too has old cottages clustered    
 around st.Chad's church and the beck, 
 but is without large modern estates.  
 With its Public House,Village hall and
 school it is a pleasant place in which
 to live.Sudbrooke pop.890 lies between
 the A158 &amp; Scothern lane.Many detached
 houses have been built in the grounds 
 of the former Sudbrooke park.It has   
 St.Edwards church,scout camp and      
 riding school.A village hall and      
 playing field are planned.            </content>
