 Barnwell C.E.(Aided) Primary School   
was built in 1875. The school is       
10metres 66cms. high. There are two    
classes, a kitchen and a corridor. The 
infant class is on the right and our   
class is on the left. Mr. Parkes is the
Head Master. In maths I am looking at  
shapes and counting the sides. In      
spelling workshop we fill in the word  
which we think makes the sentence      
right. We do ALL ROUND ENGLISH books   
which have word puzzles that you have  
to solve. On Thursday Mrs. Bird comes  
and teaches us about cowboys and       
Indians. The school has 39 pupils and  
is hoping to have an extension built   
with indoor lavatories. The doors in   
the classroom  are 2metres high and    
quite hard to open.
