		<content> Inside Preston hospital only the      
 Operating Room and tools were         
 sterilized the rest of the hospital   
 was cleaned.Some of the nurses are    
 trained for special wards.The         
 difference between some nurses is the 
 time they train,a student nurse trains
 for 3 years to become a staff nurse   
 and she trains for 2 years to become a
 sister.In a ward there are about 30-32
 beds.On a ward there are 2 sisters,2  
 staff nurses, 2 S.E.N.pupils and      
 student nurses.tThere are more female 
 than male nurses but males get easier 
 promotions.A porter takes paitents to 
 other departments such as the         
 operating room.The O.R. is kept very  
 clean an donly a limited number of    
 people work it.In an average size     
 hospital there are 50 wards.No        
 jewellery is worn by nurses in case it
 falls into a wound. by Elaine Towers  </content>
