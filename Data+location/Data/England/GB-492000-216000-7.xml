		<title>07WHAT WE EAT</title>
		<content> We eat all sorts of food like Chinese 
 Indian French Italian.Hamburgers and  
 chips which are both junk food from a 
 take-away shop.                       
  For breakfast I normally have cereal 
 which consists of wheat barley oats   
 maize and rye.Then I have toast and   
 marmalade.                            
  For lunch I have beans or cheese on  
 toast or maybe sandwiches.Then cake or
 chocolate.                            
  For dinner I might have meat with    
 potatoes and vegetables.For pudding   
 I might have tinned fruit or a pie    
 with ice-cream.                       
  People usually eat these things.     
  At christmas,people have turkey,roast
