		<title>12SOCIAL CONCERNS</title>
		<content> Social concerns.                      
       Some feel that the old village  
 community spirit is disappearing. Many
 fear that this will be further        
 undermined if more and more houses    
 become holiday cottages.              
       There is a fear amongst         
 villagers in Nawton and Beadlam that  
 the villages will become              
 over-developed. Small orchards and    
 pieces of open land are gradually     
 being built on.                       
       A steady increase in the volume 
 of traffic using the A170 through     
 Nawton/ Beadlam is also of concern to 
 the villagers who see it as a threat  
 to peace and quiet.                   
       Another concern is the use of   
 Wombleton Aerodrome for microlight    
 flying. This is considered to be a    
 great nuisance by some villagers.
