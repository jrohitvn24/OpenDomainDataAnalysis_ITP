		<title>19BURWASH COMMON</title>
		<content>    At Burwash Commom we have a lovely 
 big playing field, there is apparatus 
 to play on, swings, a see-saw and a   
 climbing frame. Each year a fete is   
 organized, there are lots of different
 stalls down each side of the field. In
 the pavilion you can buy drinks, cakes
 and ice-cream. This year Joanna and I,
 my name is Sarah, ran a jewellery     
 stall with other bits and bobs too.We 
 raised Â£9.00.                         
    Buckle's is opposite the playing   
 field, the people keep Peacocks and   
 Pheasants, they grow and sell         
 vegetables, the grounds of the house  
 are very beautiful and a church fete  
 is held here anually. I entered the   
 Fancy-dress Compitition as Peirrot the
 Clown and my sister Katie entered as a
 Match-stick Man holding a sign that   
 said, 'No More Strikes'!
