		<content>   A survey on property. The children  
 from Woolaston School counted 482     
 properties in the parish of           
 Woolaston.The children then counted   
 the newer houses that have been built 
 in the last 20 years-this figure was  
 195. Therefore 40.5% of the houses are
 relatively new. The influx of         
 newcomers from away has caused some   
 difficulties  between the original and
 new inhabitants.                      
   One advantage to the village brought
 by the new housing has been the       
 retention of the old village school.  
 In other parts of Gloucestershire,    
 village schools have been closing     
 down.(see photo) Number of children in
