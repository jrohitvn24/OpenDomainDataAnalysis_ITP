		<title>18SUPERSTITION IN THRESHFIELD</title>
		<content> Of the many{superstitions}the story of
{'Pam the Fiddler'}is the most local.  
{'Pam'}is the ghost of a former        
{Threshfield Schoolmaster}who was      
 murdered by the{Rector}because he     
 regarded the playing of such an       
 instrument as unbecoming of a{master  
 of{Threshfield School. 'Pam'}(the     
 reason for such a name is unknown) is 
 said to appear as a figure dressed in 
{Schoolmasters clothing}with the       
{bearded head}of a{goat.}He is said to 
 haunt the{Primary School.             
 One famous incident goes as follows:  
 A{Girston Tinker}was passing the      
{school}on a cold night and was        
 attacked by{'Pam'.}The{Tinker took    
 refuge in{'Holy Well'.}Because of this
{'Pam'}was unable to put a spell on him
 but thought that the{'Tinker '}would  
 die of cold anyway.However, the{Tinker
 eventually emerged feeling fitter.    </content>
