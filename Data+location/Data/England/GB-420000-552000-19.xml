  Stanley's top tourist attractions    
 have been hit by a spreading pollution
 menace which poses a health risk to   
 visitors.This summer,families visiting
 the Causey Arch,Causey Mill and       
 Beamish Burn sites will be warned not 
 to bathe in or to drink from the      
 stream which flows through all three  
 sites before passing Beamish          
 Museum.The alert follows              
 investigations by analysts which      
 reveals the stream is a potential     
 health hazard.Councils believe the    
 source of the pollution to be the East
 Tanfield sewage treatment works but   
 this was disputed by the water works.
