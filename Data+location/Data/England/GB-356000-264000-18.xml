		<content>{ST. Michael's and all Angels Church.  
 Used as College Chapel since they were
 both built. College Choir attracted   
 many visitors to daily and Sunday     
 Choral Services and thus helped       
 substantially with the upkeep of      
 the buildings and the Warden taking   
 most of the Services.With the closure 
 of the College the future of the      
 Church is in jeopardy as it doubtful  
 if a Parish with under 1500 could     
 maintain it.                          
{Church of England. }Most are of this  
 denomination and worship at Churches  
 at Bockleton, Leysters, Middleton on  
 the Hill, Tenbury Wells and at present
 St.Michaels.                          
{Catholics and Methodists }worship at  
 Leominster or Tenbury Wells.          
{Baptists}at Leominster.
