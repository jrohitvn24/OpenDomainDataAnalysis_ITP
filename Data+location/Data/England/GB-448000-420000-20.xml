		<title>20LOW FLYING AIRCRAFT</title>
		<content>{Twice a day we are disturbed by low   
{flying aircraft which come mainly from
{R.A.F.Church Fenton and R.A.F.        
{Finningley.}These are mostly Tornadoes
 but occasionally we see Jaguars,Jet   
 Provosts and large American A-10's.   
 The R.A.F. told us that they had to   
 fly low for pilot training so that in 
 the event of war they would be        
 prepared and could act swiftly.They   
 experience problems because of the    
 overcrowded air space.Flights cannot  
 be made near British Civil Airspace so
 they have to use the most suitable    
 space available.                      
{Both R.A.F. bases receive one         
{complaint a week on average,}but most 
 people seem to realise the importance 
 of low flying and don't complain.We   
 often hear them at school but we are  
 used to the noise now and don't notice
 it sometimes.                         </content>
