		<title>10THE QUEENS VISIT TO CALOW</title>
		<content>            by Claire Peters           
 On March 15th 1985 the Queen of       
 England was to come to Calow,to open  
 the new hospital.It was a very        
 exciting week.Everyone was getting    
 prepared for the Special Occasion.    
 Policemen and women came and searched 
 the area on foot,with dogs and with   
 binoculars from the rooftop.Finally   
 the great day came.People started     
 going into the grounds early.The      
 weather wasnot too good,but they      
 werent going to miss the special      
 event.It was a long time until she    
 came,but at 3.35pm the Queen finally  
 arrived. She was wearing a pink hat   
 and a pink suit. After she had        
 officially opened the hospital,she    
 went along Top Road, down Church Lane,
 along Blacksmith Lane, all in         
 Calow,and off to her next visit.
