		<title>10  WELLESBOURNE VILLAGE(1)</title>
		<content>    Wellesbourne is still classified   
as a village,although with a population
of nearly 5000 it is felt that only a  
few larger shops are required before it
can be known as a town.At the moment   
the population is increasing quite     
rapidly with the development of the    
Dovehouse Estate to the SW of the      
village.                               
    The village is mainly residential  
with many people working in the nearby 
towns of Stratford-on-Avon,Warwick and 
Leamington Spa.However, there are many 
small shops and a regular bus service  
to the nearby towns mentioned above.A  
lot of traffic passes through the      
village, and a by-pass is being        
planned,which threatens to separate the
Dovehouse Estate from the rest of the  
village.
