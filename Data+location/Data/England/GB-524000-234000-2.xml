		<content>  This block is mainly undulating chalk
 country, where the Chilterns merge    
 with the East Anglian Heights.        
                                       
  All the land is between 50-100 metres
 above sea level and the chalk is      
 usually covered by a thin layer of    
 glacial till (boulder clay) brought by
 ice sheets from the Midlands during   
 the Ice Age.                          
                                       
  A small dry valley cuts E-W across   
 the block and the London-Cambridge    
 railway uses two smaller dry valleys  
 to cut through a spur of land which   
 rises to 96 metres at Bygrave.        
                                       
  The only surface stream is the       
 headwaters of the River Ivel in the   
 S.W. square of the area, where it runs
 out of Baldock.
