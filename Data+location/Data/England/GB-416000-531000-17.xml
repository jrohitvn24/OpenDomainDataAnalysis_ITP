		<title>17LEEK GROWING</title>
		<content> Leek growing is very popular in this  
 part of the country.Not only do       
 people  like cooking and eating leeks 
 but they also grow them for           
 competitions.These competitions are   
 run by the local Workingmen's Clubs,  
 and many pubs Leek Shows too.There are
 cash prizes of anything up to Â£200 for
 having the prize leek.This means that 
 the men take their leek growing very  
 seriously and there is a lot of       
 rivalry between leek growers.         
    To grow leeks first you build a    
 trench.You have to make sure that the 
 soil is very rich before you plant    
 your 'sets'.Most people use manure &amp;  
 you have to weed your leeks &amp; water   
 them daily.Rotting leaves have to be  
 pul;led off straight away.Lots of leek
 growers have secret ingredients to    
 make their leeks grow to champion     
 size.                                 </content>
