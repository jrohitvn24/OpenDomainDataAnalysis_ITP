		<title>16Brighton Aquarium</title>
		<content> Brighton Aquarium was established by a
 private company in 1869. Scientists   
 praised the internal designs and      
 management. In early days King Edward 
 VII, Queen Alexandra, many European   
 Monarchs, foreign Princes and Oriental
 Royalty 'toured the tanks'.           
 The original building was designed by 
 Mr E. Birch of London, and it took    
 three years to build it. In 1900      
 Brighton Corporation acquired it and  
 alterations were made. It was         
 modernised in 1927 and reverted to    
 private enterprise in 1956, a lease   
 was granted to Aquarium Entertainers  
 Ltd. its present owners.              
 In 1968 a major scheme was approved,  
 costing Â£200,000. A pool 80' by 30'   
 and 10' deep was constructed.         
 Filtration equipment installed to     
 ensure the 200,000 gallons of         
 sea_water maintains it's condition.   </content>
