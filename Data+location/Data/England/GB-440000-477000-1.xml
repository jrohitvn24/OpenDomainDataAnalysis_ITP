		<title>01A view of rural Sowerby.</title>
		<content>     This area is agricultural land,   
 cut by a new arterial road and the    
 main railway line between London and  
 Edinburgh.                            
     The area is in the Vale of York,  
 fringing the villages of Dalton,      
 Topcliffe and Sowerby.                
     The population of the block is    
 involved almost exclusively with      
 agriculture, which is mainly arable _ 
 crops such as barley,potatoes and     
 sugar beet. However,most of the       
 farmers also have intensive stock     
 rearing units holding pigs, barley    
 bulls and poultry. The poultry rearing
 is by far the most significant,as     
 there is a poultry processing factory 
 nearby.                               
     The Cod Beck runs through the area
 North to South joining the river Swale
 at Topcliffe.                         
                                       </content>
