		<content>   There are many allotments in upper  
 Norward. An allotment is a small piece
 of ground where people grow flowers,  
 fruit and vegetables. Some of the     
 people have gardens but need more     
 space while others have no garden and 
 rely on allotments for growing things.
 On their allotments people grow a     
 variety of vegetables including       
 cabbeges, carrots, potatoes, leeks,   
 radishes and tomatoes. Most of the    
 people we interviewed were retired and
 so had time to spend on there         
 allotments. One man had had his       
 allotment since 1952. People spent an 
 average of 3 hours a day on their     
 allotments but one man spent at least 
 7 hours a day. For most of the people 
 we interviewed, having an allotment   
 was a hobby.
