		<title>09The Axminster to Lyme Train</title>
		<content> In 1903 the Axminster to Lyme Regis   
 Railway line opened. On the trains    
 goods were carried such as, coal,     
 cattle, sheep, milk in churns, lamb   
 and farm produce.                     
                                       
   The passenger service started with  
 six trains each way every day with the
 maximum of ten in the summer months.  
 It was called the "Bluebell"line      
 because some parts were covered with  
 bluebells.                            
                                       
   It took three years to build.It was 
 in use for 62 years.Now it is just    
 thistles and grass.A bridge opening   
 has been blocked off with barbed      
 wire.Although it has been recemented  
 underneath there is a big crack in the
 middle.                               
                                       
                                       </content>
