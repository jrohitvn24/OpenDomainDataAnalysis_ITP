		<title>14BEVERTON FARM</title>
		<content> He does not think that he will ever   
 sell the farm or move away and says   
 that he can still easily manage his   
 five acres. He misses the bullocks and
 in the old days he used to have       
 someone in to help him with the hay   
 making. He still has his old tractor  
 but rarely uses it now.               
 Going into the house was like having  
 the clock turned back a hundred years 
 although I am sure that there must be 
 other farms like this in the area,    
 it is such an enormous contrast to    
 the wealthy large farms with their    
 large flocks of sheep and horses.     
 Strangely he has no dog but a black   
 cat eyed us rather suspiciously while 
 we talked in the kitchen.             
 I just wonder how long such a life    
 style will last, I suppose he will be 
 the last of a generation and after    
 that it will disappear for ever.      </content>
