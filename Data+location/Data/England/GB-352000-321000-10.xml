		<content> On Saturday I got up at 9:20 a.m.,got 
 dressed and went downstairs.My mum was
 baking as usual so she didn't stop to 
 talk.My dad was cursing the dogs      
 because they were jumping at the      
 door.Tom was in the sitting room      
 watching television so I went in and  
 joined him.                           
   At 1:00 p.m. we all went up to my   
 grandma's for dinner.                 
   At 2:30 p.m.Tom went to Tom         
 Baddeley's party and Mum,dad and I    
 went to Hodges and Moss to buy blight 
 spray.When we arrived home I played on
 the computer.                         
   At 5:00 p.m. mum called me for tea  
 and after tea we all collected Tom    
 from the birthday party and visited   
 our friends.                          
   At 9:00 p.m.we had some toast and   
 watched television.Later we moved the 
 irrigation and then we went to bed.   </content>
