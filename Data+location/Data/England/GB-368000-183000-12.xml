		<title>12BUILDINGS IN NORTH YATE</title>
		<content> The oldest houses in the area are     
 about 300 years old. The newest were  
 built on an estate about a year ago.  
 The majority of people have moved into
 their present house within the last   
 fifteen years. Most people like the   
 area they live in because it is quiet,
 and they prefer the countryside.      
 Feelings are mixed about Yate         
 Shopping Centre. Some people like it, 
 while others find it insufficient for 
 their needs. On the whole, people buy 
 clothes, everyday goods, and do-it-   
 yourself items in Yate, and go to     
 Bristol for furniture and more        
 expensive clothes. Not many people    
 shop in Bath. A lot of people are     
 worried about the way Yate is growing 
 so fast. They think that the          
 industrial pollution from the         
 factories on the trading estate will  
 spoil the environment.                </content>
