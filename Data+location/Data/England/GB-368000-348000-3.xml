		<content> There are 3 Churches in the area of   
 Wybunbury and Hough.                  
                                       
  The Anglican Church is situated in   
 Wybunbury and is a modern building    
 which can also be used as a Church    
 Hall.This Church replaced the         
 traditional style Church, which had to
 be demolished due to subsidence.Only  
 the tower of this Church remains      
 standing.The incumbent of the Parish  
 is also Priest in charge of           
 Doddington.                           
                                       
  The other Churches are of Methodist  
 denomination,one in Wybunbury and one 
 in Hough.These are under the          
 supervision of the Minister of Audlem.
                                       
  Wybunbury School is Church Aided and 
 thus has close contacts with the      
 Anglican Church.                      </content>
