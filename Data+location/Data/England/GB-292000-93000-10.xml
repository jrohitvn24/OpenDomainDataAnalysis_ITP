		<title>10The Devon County Show.</title>
		<content> The showground is situated quite a    
 distance from Exeter's town centre    
 next to St James High School.The show 
 is held annually on three consecutive 
 days by the Devon County Agricultural 
 Association. Every year great         
 preparations are made in setting up   
 the large tents (marquees). The show  
 usually takes place in May, and       
 farmers from all over Devon take part 
 by bringing their animals and produce.
 In May 1985,{H.R.H Princess Anne,}    
 daughter of{Queen Elizabeth II}       
 opened the show. Most of the          
 activities are looked at and judged.  
  You can see horses being shoed and   
 sheep being sheared, which is a       
 great skill. Many thousands come to   
 visit and this year St James High     
 School won two awards for their       
 exhibition in the Schools Tent.
