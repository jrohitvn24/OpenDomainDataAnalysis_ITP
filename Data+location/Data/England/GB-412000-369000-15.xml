   When the Rev.J.F.Warden was vicar   
 soon after the First World War,he and 
 his wife began a Shrove Tuesday Tea   
 for the whole village which was held  
 in the Institute.This became a social 
 event which seemed to lapse when he   
 retired in 1940.                      
   Harvest Festival is the Sunday after
 the 11th October.Years ago it was the 
 start of Wakes Week.It was a week when
 relatives would try to return home.The
 eating of a plum pudding was a special
 feature of table fare that week.There 
 would be a public dance most evenings 
 of the week.The associated fair with  
 swing boats,coconut shies and other   
 stalls continued until about 1960 but 
 Wakes Week declined earlier.          
   It has been suggested that the PCC  
 should organise a Harvest Supper to be
 followed by a Social Evening.         </content>
