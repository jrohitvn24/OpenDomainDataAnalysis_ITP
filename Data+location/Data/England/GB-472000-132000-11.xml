		<title>11A New Selborne Inhabitant.</title>
		<content> Mr Henderson has lived in Selborne for
 7 years. He came to live there because
 there was a house available only 4    
 miles from his office, where he is a  
 company director for a firm selling   
 weighbridges. One job before this was 
 as a ship deck officer in the Merchant
 Navy travelling all over the world. He
 likes living in Selborne very much    
 because it is a small community. This 
 makes it easy to get to know people   
 and become part of the village        
 quickly. He feels that giving to      
 village life is as important as taking
 from it but sees that this could be a 
 disadvantage if you don't get on with 
 the people around you. In his job he  
 still travels a lot, around 25,000    
 miles a year but he likes to come     
 home.His hobbies are golf, steam      
 trains and botany and for this        
 Selborne is a good place to be.       </content>
