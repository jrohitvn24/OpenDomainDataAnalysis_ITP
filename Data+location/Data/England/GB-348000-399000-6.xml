		<title>06 FARMING:EMPLOYMENT ETC.</title>
		<content>  Most farms are owned or rented by a  
family and so that family farms them.  
Some,however,employ workers,usually    
from this area and are not farmed by   
the farm owners.Many youths are        
recruited on a Youth Training Scheme   
and afterwards stay on at that         
particular farm as a labourer.During   
harvesting,especially if there is poor 
weather forecasted,the labourers may   
work from daylight to daybreak i.e.at  
least 14 hours a day and usually at the
weekend if necessary to get the crops  
in in time.                            
  Winter and summer barley provide a   
year round crop.As the name suggests   
the winter barley is harvested in the  
late winter months and the summer      
barley in the summer.
