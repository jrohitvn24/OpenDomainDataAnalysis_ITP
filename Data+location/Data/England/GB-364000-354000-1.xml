		<content>                                       
 Our area consists of twelve square    
 kilometres to the north of the        
 historic market town of Nantwich in   
 Cheshire and to the east of the modern
 railway centre of Crewe.              
 The area was settled at the time of   
 the first Domesday survey and three   
 local placenames are recorded in the  
 first Domesday book.                  
 The area,which contains the Weaver    
 Valley,is noted for its dairy         
 farms.                                
 There is some industry to the         
 east in the Crewe area.Rolls Royce and
 BREL are both based in Crewe.         
 The area is becoming popular with     
 tourists. Several well known          
 personalities have stayed in the      
 area,including Mrs Thatcher, the pop  
 group ABBA and John Portlock.
