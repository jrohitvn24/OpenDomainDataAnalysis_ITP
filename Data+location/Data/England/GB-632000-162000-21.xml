Reading this entry in 2011 I was interested to see that the Viking caravan site was still running in 1986. My family went there for our summer holidays for three years from 1963-65. I seem to remember that in the first year the place had only just opened. There was a club house where one year I managed to win the jackpot on the slot machine that took the old threepenny bit coins. I also recall the small playground with some swings which I used even though I thought I was too old to do so. There were some large poplar trees. From Google streetview I see that there is nothing left at all now, and a new housing development occupies the site.   &lt;br />
