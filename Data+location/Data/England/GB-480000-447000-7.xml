		<title>07Nuclear Arms</title>
		<content> A few of us have the fear of waking up
 next day and to hear the four minute  
 warning. This is the time it takes    
 before a nuclear missile hits us and  
 we would die. In Pocklington we would 
 have a slow and painful death as only 
 the radiation would reach us.         
 CND is a group of people who think    
 nuclear arms should be banned because 
 they endanger our lives and the next  
 generations. They demonstrate outside 
 the targets that would be hit in a    
 nuclear war for example Fylingdales on
 the North Yorkshire Moors.            
 If there was a World War Three there  
 would not be a lot left. Nearly       
 everyone would be killed and if anyone
 did survive the Earth would have great
 craters like the Moon, where the      
 nuclear arms would hit. America is now
 planning to shoot down missiles in    
 midair with lasers.                   </content>
