		<title>09THE LIBRARY, BOURNE</title>
		<content> To study{recreation}in Bourne, two    
 members of Westfield School went to { 
{Bourne Library}in South Street. The   
 library is open for seven hours each  
 day, except Saturday when it is open  
 for three hours. On Wednesday and     
 Sunday the library is closed. The     
 busiest days of the week are Tuesdays 
 and Saturdays. Before the library was 
 built twenty years ago the area was a 
 field.                                
 The most popular books are novels.    
 When you come through the door you can
 see the desk which is on the left. To 
 the right there is a children's room. 
 The study room has a photocopier.     
 You can choose up to six books. They  
 are stamped in a machine and you can  
 keep them for up to twentyfour days.  
 The library holds activities for      
 children during the summer holidays.
