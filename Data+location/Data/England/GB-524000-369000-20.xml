   The Romans invaded the area in the  
 4th Century A.D. They built Horncastle
 with a wall around it and parts of    
 this can still be seen today.         
   In Mediaeval Times the Horsefair was
 started. People came from all over the
 world to buy their horses. The market 
 has now declined into a cattle market 
 which is much smaller.{               
   The canal was constructed before the
 railway to transport goods but fell   
 into disuse as the railway became more
 popular. It was closed in the 1950s   
 and is now a nature trail.            </content>
