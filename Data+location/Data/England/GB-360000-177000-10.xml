		<title>10LEO'S SUPERSTORE</title>
		<content>      Leo's Superstore is one of the   
 largest supermarkets in the Filton    
 area, and so it attracts customers    
 from many of the housing estates in   
 the locality.  16,000 customers use   
 Leo's during the week, with Thursday, 
 Friday and Saturday being the busiest 
 days.  Opening hours are 9a.m. to     
 8p.m. Monday to Friday, 9a.m. to 5p.m.
 Saturday.                             
      The store has an area of 23,000  
 square feet most of which is retail   
 area-less than 25% being for storage  
 or offices.  On average there is      
 Â£200,000 worth of goods in the store, 
 the most expensive item being a bottle
 of brandy.  General groceries account 
 for almost 80% of the sales , with    
 meat sales being about 10%, and non   
 food items accounting for 10%.  Leo's 
 employ 150 staff.  There are 18 cash  
 tills.   Shoplifting is a problem.    </content>
