  There are small{hamlets}whose        
 residents cover a wide range of ages _
 Junior school to retirement.Few men   
 are actually employed on the farms and
 none of the children are likely to    
 work in the{country.}For economic     
 reasons most wives work.              
  Few tradesmen call at the{cottages}so
 people depend on what they grow in the
 garden and on shopping trips to nearby
 towns.                                
  About a quarter of the people go to  
{church}regularly and the children     
 belong to the{Scouting}and{Guiding    
 movement.                             
  In spite of varied backgrounds and   
 types of education there is still a   
 friendly atmosphere and chats at the  
 garden gate.
