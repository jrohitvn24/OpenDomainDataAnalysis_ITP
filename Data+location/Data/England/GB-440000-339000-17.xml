		<title>17A BETTER VILLAGE--M.WILSON</title>
		<content> AROUND WEST HALLAM WE NEED A HOSPITAL 
 BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO GO TO ILKESTON AND
 IT IS EXPENSIVE AND TIME-COSUMING.I   
 ALSO THINK THAT WE SHOULD HAVE MORE   
 SHOPS BECAUSE WE ONLY HAVE TWO POST   
 OFFICES,ONE BAKERY AND CRESSWELLS THE 
 SUPERMARKET.A CAR PARK IS NEEDED NEXT 
 TO THE CRICKET AS THERE IS NOT ENOUGH 
 SPACE FOR ALL THE CARS.I THINK THAT   
 DAMAGED ROADS SHOULD BE REPAIRED AS   
 THERE ARE DANGEROUS POT-HOLES THAT    
 SHOULD BE FILLED IN WITH TARMAC OR    
 GRAVEL.I WOULD LIKE A SWIMMING POOL TO
 BE OPPOSITE THE POST-OFFICE,WHICH IS  
 BUILT IN STONE SIMILAR TO THE OLD     
 VILLAGE HOUSE.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
