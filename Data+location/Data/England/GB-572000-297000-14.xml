		<title>14RELIGION IN NORTHWOLD</title>
		<content> The parish church dedicated to St     
 Andrew was probably started in 1229   
 when Hugh de Northwold,a native of the
 village,was consecrated Bishop of Ely.
 The most important feature is the     
 Easter Sepulchre,beautifully carved   
 from local chalk stone and reputed to 
 be the finest in the country.There is 
 a peal of 8 bells,also a set of       
 handbells.Since 1981 there has been no
 resident Rector,the parish being      
 combined with Methwold.               
 Holy Communion is held on the first   
 and third Sundays of the month;Holy   
 Communion with Matins on the second   
 and fourth Sundays;combined services  
 with Methwold on the fifth Sunday;    
 Evensong on the first and third       
 Sundays in Summer.                    
 Methodist worshippers attend services 
 in Methwold as both chapels in        
 Northwold are now closed.             </content>
