		<content> The Evening Echo has had a number of  
 reports about Barling like the House  
 with a phantom that flushes the loo.It
 all happened when they went on        
 holiday. Their next door neighbour had
 been told to keep an eye on the house 
 while they were away.She looked though
 the window and there was a light on in
 the bathroom and all of a sudden the  
 loo flushed  and a little old lady    
 appeared at the window.  From that    
 day onwards it has been called the    
 house with a phantom that flushes the 
 loo. It was also reported that Barling
 won a cup for the best kept village.  
 sponsored by the Rural Community      
 Council of Essex. In February 1985    
 plans were reported for a 18 hole golf
 course near the River Roach. In 1985  
 it was also reported that a yacht club
 wanted to move to Barling Creek.
