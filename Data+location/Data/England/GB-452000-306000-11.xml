		<title>11A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A MUM</title>
		<content>{JILL KNIGHT - ANSTEY LEICS.}          
 I wake up at 7 am and get up at 7.30  
 to begin another day. After getting   
 breakfast for the children, washing up
 and packing lunches for everyone, I   
 get myself ready for work for 9.00am. 
                                       
 I work for a company which distributes
 books and I deal with orders for USA. 
 Lunch break arrives and I shop for    
 dinner on my way home, before         
 returning in the afternoon.           
                                       
 At 4 pm I return home and start       
 preparations for evening dinner. This 
 is the most enjoyable time of the day 
 to me,as we can all discuss the days  
 events. After dinner is finished,there
 are a few more chores to do before    
 relaxing for an hour or two with my   
 husband,usually reading or watching   
 TV and finally to bed about 11 pm.    </content>
