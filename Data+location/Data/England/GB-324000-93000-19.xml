		<title>19THE VILLAGE OF MUSBURY</title>
		<content> Musbury village gets its name from the
 Iron Age hill fort which crowns the   
 hill above the village. The Parish    
 Church is a 15th century structure,   
 although it has been restored. The    
 chancel was rebuilt in 1865 and the   
 north Aisle in 1875. There is much    
 other Victorian work. An important    
 feature is the Drake monument, erected
 in 1611. Sir Francis Drake was a      
 distant relation of this family. There
 is also a Methodist Church. Musbury   
 lies on the main road running from    
 Seaton to Axminster.There is a garage,
 a post office and general stores and a
 pub,"The Golden Hind." A youth club   
 meets in the new village hall. The    
 village Primary School has 3 teachers 
 and about 40 children. There is a road
 named after John Churchill, Duke of   
 Marlborough, who is said to have been 
 born at Ashe House.                   </content>
