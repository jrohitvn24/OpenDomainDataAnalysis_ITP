		<title>17Recreation - lake usage.</title>
		<content> Millerground, on the lake shore, is   
 the site of Cumbria County Council's  
 water activities base. Using buildings
 rented from the National Trust,       
 parties of children from schools and  
 youth groups in south Cumbria are able
 to make use of canoes and sailing     
 boats at the base. There is only a    
 part-time warden, and staff bringing  
 groups have to have a suitable        
 qualification. This is also the site  
 of the only public swimming area on   
 the lake  shore. Elsewhere the bottom 
 shelves steeply and there have been a 
 few accidents every year. The local   
 private girls school also has a boat  
 house and does sailing, wind-surfing  
 and canoeing. Millerground bay has a  
 number of council moorings which are  
 rented (Â£80 per year for a small boat)
 by both locals and 'offcomers'. Water 
 skiers are often zooming by.          </content>
