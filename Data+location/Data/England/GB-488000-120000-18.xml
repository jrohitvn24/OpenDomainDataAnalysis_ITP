		<title>18THE SUPERNATURAL IN MIDHURST</title>
		<content> The original Cowdray House was built  
 in 152O by Sir David Owen.Next to     
 build onto the house was Sir William  
 Fitz-William.It was then sold and     
 completed by Sir Anthony Brown who    
 became Lord Montague.A prioress put a 
 curse on the house and family,the     
 curse of fire and water.When the fire 
 occured the family was away but the   
 house and contents were destroyed.Two 
 weeks later Sir Anthony Brown was     
 drowned.The curse was fulfilled.A grey
 lady,believed to be the prioress,     
 walks through the woods at night.     
     Both the Angel and Spread Eagle   
 hotels are alleged to be haunted,the  
 Angel by one ghost and the Spread     
 Eagle by two.                         
     None of the local ghosts appear to
 be harmful.
