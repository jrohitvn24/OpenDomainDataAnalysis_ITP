		<content>With the decline in the walking from   
one place to another, traditional      
public right of way footpaths are being
less used.  They are in danger of being
forgotten and lost - by falling into   
disuse.  People are setting out to     
record, and walk them, to continue the 
"right of way".                        
As hedges are being torn out, rights of
way which ran along them are now in the
middle of huge fields.  Many are being 
"ploughed out".  Others are obstructed 
by farmers who wish them to fall into  
disuse because they are too difficult  
to traverse.  Other farmers preserve   
them and assist walkers.  Jokes are    
made about rights of way through       
country houses.
