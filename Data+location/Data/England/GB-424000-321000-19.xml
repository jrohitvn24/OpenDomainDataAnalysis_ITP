     Sometimes I go to my friend's     
house.   She is called Angela.   We    
play "tick" and sometimes I go down to 
my horse.   She is a mare.   Mare      
means a female.   Her name is Bambi.   
Sometimes she is a good pony but       
usually she is naughty.  She is a dun  
which means that she has a light brown 
coat with a black mane and tail.   I   
also spend time watching the           
television.   I particularly like to   
watch "Dallas", "Grange Hill", "Cagney 
and Lacey", "Cat's Eyes", "Cover-up"   
and "Fame".                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
