		<content>    On Tuesdays I go to a club called  
 Archery  which is very exciting.You   
 have to pay 15p to get in.We get      
 sheets of paper saying what activities
 we are going to do each week.We also  
 get a comic every month.These are some
 of the things we do.We go swimming at 
 West Croft in Croydon,play games,go to
 the Recreation Ground,go to films and 
 many more things.On Saturdays we go to
 Woldingham Field and take part in     
 proper Archery.                       
   On Friday and Saturday nights my    
 family and I go to the Royal British  
 Legion in Whyteleafe. In the club     
 there is a gambling machine and a Bar 
 Billiards machine.There is a          
 children's room for ages up to 12 but 
 children over 12 go in there because  
 of the Space Invaders game and the    
 pool table.When I go to the club my   
 favourite thing is the pool table.    </content>
