		<title>19COUNTESTHORPE PARISH COUNCIL</title>
		<content> The Parish Council meets once a month 
 to make decisions about Countesthorpe.
 There are 17 councillors and only the 
 Clark gets paid,the others work       
 voluntarily.They decide and help to   
 pay for alterations in                
 Countesthorpe,such as cracks in the   
 pavement.They also help to decide much
 bigger things such as whether there is
 to be a bus route down Rosebank Road  
 and Gwendoline Drive in Countesthorpe.
 Recently they decided to put two paths
 through the spinney which has only mud
 paths at the moment.

{council owns the village hall,they    
{don't.They only help to repair it.The

{events from slimming to Sunday School.
