		<content>   Our parish church is built of flints
 and stone. It is dedicated to St. John
 the Baptist. It was originally a      
 priory church bought back by the      
 townspeople 3 years after the         
 dissolution of the monasteries by     
 Henry V111.                           
   There are three special services:-  
 baptisms, weddings and funerals. The  
 baptisms are usually on Sundays,      
 weddings on Saturdays and funerals can
 be on any day.The main services-      
 Matins, Communion and Evensong are on 
 Sundays.A choir leads the singing at  
 many of the services.Music is played  
 on the organ.                         
   There are church groups which meet  
 in houses, a Sunday School and two    
 youth groups. The 3 clergy visit      
 people who are ill or in hospital.    
   The church income is about 20,000   
 pounds a year.                        </content>
