		<title>08ART AND CRAFT IN HORSHAM</title>
		<content> In Horsham a wide range of crafts can 
 be found. Many people do craft for    
 fun. The opportunity exists to belong 
 to clubs and societies, or attending  
 day/night classes at Forest Boys      
 Community Centre.                     
 There are adult education courses for 
 a variety of crafts. Most popular are 
 violin making, spinning, weaving and  
 dyeing. Twelve people are needed in   
 order to run one of these classes.    
 Women attend more often than men.     
 Horsham also has a school of art,     
 dating from 1881, now located in Hurst
 road. It offers two full time courses 
 for students from the North Sussex    
 area. The newly opened Arts centre    
 often displays work received from     
 artists both in and ot of the area.   
 Horsham District Council makes        
 frequent provision for craft fayres to
 be held in the old Town Hall.         </content>
