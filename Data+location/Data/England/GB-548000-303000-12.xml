 A survey was conducted amongst 60     
 children at Beaupre Community Primary 
 School to find out how many parents   
 and relations of children at the      
 school had work connected with        
 farming. The survey was conducted on  
 June 5th 1985. Our results showed     
 that 21 children had mothers          
 involved in farm work whilst 8        
 fathers worked on farms. 30 of the    
 children themselves earned money      
 from fruit picking in the summer      
 months.
