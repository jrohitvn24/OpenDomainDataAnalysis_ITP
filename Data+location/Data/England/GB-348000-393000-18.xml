		<title>18The St.Helens Show</title>
		<content> In 1968 St.Helens celebrated its      
 centenary by holding a three day show.
 It was a success and has become an    
 annual event held in the large open   
 spaces of Sherdley Park.              
   Many different events take place at 
 the same time.In 1985 they include a  
 stunt flying team,jazz bands,clay     
 pigeon shooting,competitions for      
 craftwork,horticulture and fur and    
 feather.Local firms display their     
 products together with national and   
 international companies in a large    
 exhibition tent.There is a small      
 charge to go inside the tent itself.  
   A large outside arena is set out and
 crowds of people watch displays by    
 mainly the armed forces.These include 
 parachute jumping and motorcycle      
 displays.                             
   It is an enjoyable time,especially  
 as the admission is free.             </content>
