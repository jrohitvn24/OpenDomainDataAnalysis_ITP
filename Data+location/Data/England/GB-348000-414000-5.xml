       Many new families have moved    
into Mawdesley over the past twenty    
years.Unlike the old days,many did not 
have connections with the church, so   
there was a need for a different kind  
of meeting place.                      
       Money to build it was raised in 
different ways,chiefly from "It's a    
Knockout" competitions,and in 1974 a   
new hall was opened.It has a large hall
with a stage,smaller rooms and a bar.  
       It is used by people of all ages
in the village.It serves as a meeting  
place for the clinic,the playgroup,the 
Dramatic Society,the Badminton Club,the
Tennis Club,the Youth Club and for     
private functions. It is run by a      
committee which is elected every year.
