		<title>1892 Years Living in Harpenden</title>
		<content> Mr Chalkley was born in a cottage next
 door to the shoe repair shop in Grove 
 Road.   He is 92 years old and has    
 lived in Harpenden all his life.      
                                       
 His father was a gardener on an       
 estate, now Aldwickbury school and his
 mother plaited straw at home.         
                                       
 At ten years of age he delivered      
 papers to Mackerye End.   He started  
 work at 16 as an apprentice at        
 Kingston House Mowers and worked there
 for 52 years. He fought for the       
 mounted cavalry in the lst World War. 
                                       
 Mr Chalkley has seen many changes in  
 Harpenden.  The Council dammed off the
 River Lea to make a swimming pool and 
 it was vandalised.  Although Harpenden
 has been through many changes he does 
 not think Harpenden is spoilt.        </content>
