		<content>{Birthday Treat 1985}                  
                                       
 On my birthday I went to Sewerby near 
 Bridlington. I saw a white owl, eight 
 parrots and three budgies. We had a   
 packed lunch. I had  go on the swings,
 had my photo taken and went to the    
 beach. My relatives were there and    
 they sang 'Happy Birthday' to me. I   
 got in my costume. My dad was         
 sunbathing and I buried him in the    
 sand. He chased after me and my       
 brother joined in the fun.            
 I got dressed and my dad said that it 
 was time to go home on the train.     
 When we got home my Dad sneaked in to 
 get a surprise party ready for me. I  
 had a great time.                     
 I call that a SPECIAL birthday treat.
