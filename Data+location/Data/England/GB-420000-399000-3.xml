		<title>03Farming in the Hunshelf area</title>
		<content>  This area is predominantly farmland  
 and includes mainly pastureland for   
 dairy farming,and some arable.The main
 livestock kept are Friesian cows,     
 others include sheep,horses,pigs      
 and goats.A farm could own up to 150  
 cows,and one bull.                    
  The major crop is grass for the      
 livestock,but some cereals and root   
 vegetables are also grown.            
  The fields,separated by dry-stone    
 walls,have an average size of around 5
 acres,but could be as large as 12     
 acres.                                
  The people who work on the farms are 
 generally the owner and his family.The
 produce(eg eggs,milk,beef,cereal      
 crops) is sold to the Milk Marketing  
 Board,at market,or to passers-by      
 attracted by roadside signs.
