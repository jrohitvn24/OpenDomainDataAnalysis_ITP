		<content> The{Policeman}was born in the area,   
 and joined the Police force when in   
 his twenties. He had to do six years  
 training and service with other forces
 before he was able to get back to the 
 district. He is now 39 years old. With
 another officer he has care of the    
 whole area. They use {cars}to get     
 around; footwork would be useless in  
 this community with most individual   
 dwellings being so{isolated.}He is    
 happy here, and considers his job     
 very worthwhile. He plays a part in   
 community life, and is learning to fly
 at the Maypole airfield{Serious Crime 
 is rather rare, but he does have to   
 deal with cases of burglary rape and  
 assault from time to time.  Most      
 policing consists of road accidents,  
 petty crime, poaching, firearms laws  
 Etc.
