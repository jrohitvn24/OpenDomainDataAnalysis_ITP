		<title>15CORNISH HEDGEROWS</title>
		<content> A typical Cornish Hedge is built      
 mostly of local stone, wider at the   
 base than at the top with an infill of
 earth through the middle.The top      
 course of stones, called'copestones'  
 or 'Jack and Jill', is often placed   
 vertically to permit drainage. On top 
 of the hedge, turf cut from the       
 immediate area is placed.             
 Colonisation of bushes in a Cornish   
 hedge is slow because of its structure
 and the exposed nature of the         
 countryside.But grasses and wild      
 flowers thrive in the shelter provided
 and are able to grow in and on the    
 hedge because of the soil used in its 
 construction. The lack of shrubs,     
 bushes and trees does limit this      
 environment compared to some          
 'up-country' hedgerows which are      
 entirely constructed of plants.
