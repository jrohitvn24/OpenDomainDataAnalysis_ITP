		<title>03Commander Gammon's Talk</title>
		<content> At 10am on Monday 17th June{Commander 
{Gammon,}a local amateur historian came
 to our school to give us a lecture    
 about our study area. He brought his  
 slides and projector and when         
 everything was ready Mr Little        
 introduced him. At first he explained 
 how the whole area was shaped in the  
 ice age and that over thousands of    
 years the sea and rivers slowly       
 altered the land and the estuary, and 
 continue to do so.                    
  His slides were taken over a number  
 of years and as the slides flicked    
 over he talked about floods, sand     
 erosion and notable dates in history  
 affecting the area.                   
{ The Marsh}has been used for grazing  
 cattle and sheep since saxon days, but
 it must have been very wet and boggy  
 especially when there were Spring     
 Tides.                                </content>
