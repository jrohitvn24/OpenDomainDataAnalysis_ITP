		<title>13The local youth club</title>
		<content>On a Monday &amp; Friday evening we go to  
the local youth club which has about   
200 members aged from 11 to 17 years.  
It is a place where you can meet up    
with your friends and take part in     
numerous activities. These include     
playing table tennis, snooker, football
and other sports as well as listening  
to records.                            
Other activities such as horse         
riding,rock climbing and disco's are   
also organised and are very popular.   
Some discos are given a theme, e.g. the
Caribbean, where everyone has to dress 
in the traditional grass skirt and     
coloured tops, or the Roman Toga when  
everyone dressed in a Toga, usually    
made from an old sheet.                
All these activities are very enjoyable
and a good source of recreation.
