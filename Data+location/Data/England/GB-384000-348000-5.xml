		<title>05TRADE ETRURIA NISSAN GARAGE.</title>
		<content>  Opposite the 1986 Garden Festival    
site in Etruria is the Nissan Garage.  
Opened on the 4th of January 1985 it   
is the most modern of its type in the  
Potteries.Our small school group       
visited it on the 5th of June 1985.    
The maanager gave us a tour of all the 
buildings.We started outside where the 
new cars,brought by transporter from   
the docks,were kept.They went inside   
the cleaning bay and then to the       
mechanics room to be checked.The place 
where the cars are serviced and        
repaired is very roomy with all the    
latest equipment.A special paint mixing
room and a low bake oven were very     
interesting.After a snack in the       
canteen we went to see the stores.Then 
we visited the offices and last of all 
used the computer to find out about    
cars  and prices all over the country.
