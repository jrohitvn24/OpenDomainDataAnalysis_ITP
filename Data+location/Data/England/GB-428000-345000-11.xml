     About  thirty  years  ago,   Mr.V.
 Barber set up a woodyard  in  Windley.
 Now his son Mr.G.Barber is also in the
 business.He needs to  fetch  about  70
 tons  of  timber  each  week to ensure
 enough work for the eight employees.It
 is really  quite a dangerous job. They
 use a forklift to get  the  wood  onto
 the lorries.There are all kinds of big
 saws for dealing  with  the  wood. The
 most  expensive  kinds of wood are oak
 and yew while  mixed hardwoods are the
 cheapest.                             
     Once, they  were burning some tree
 tops at a village school.  Some people
 thought the school was on fire so they
 called the Fire Brigade.  When the men
 got back from their  lunch  they found
 the  treetops were  covered  in  foam!
