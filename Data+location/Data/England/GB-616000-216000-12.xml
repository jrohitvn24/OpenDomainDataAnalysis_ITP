		<content>     We have been finding out what are 
 the most common flowers and grasses in
 our area.                             
                                       
     The most common flowers were      
 White clover and daisy. The most      
 common grasses were Perennial rye     
 grass, Rough meadow grass, wall barley
 and Sticky willie. Cats ear and       
 Goldilocks are not that common. But   
 Rough Hawkbit, cow parsley and field  
 poppy are more common.                
                                       
     We found that it was very         
 interesting to find out all of the    
 flowers' different names.
