		<title>12Little Heath _ General</title>
		<content>   Little Heath on the edge of Potters 
 Bar, has a closely knit community with
 both old and young integrating happily
 together. Newer families have moved   
 into the area so that the parents     
 commute into London for their work.   
   The village enjoys a pleasant heath 
 top site with Christ Church occupying 
 the highest point between London and  
 York. The Church and the school play a
 prominent part in the life of the     
 community.                            
   Osborne House, Leggets Park and the 
 Royal Veterinary College reflect the  
 historical development of Little Heath
 from country estate to a national     
 centre of learning.
