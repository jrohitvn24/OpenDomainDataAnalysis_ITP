		<title>17A TYPICAL DAY OF A PARENT</title>
		<content> On a week day morning my mother makes 
 a packout then has a cup of tea and   
 reads the paper.After that she wakes  
 my brother up and gets dressed.At 7:45
 my parents go to work.At 12:00 she    
 has her dinner in the canteen at work.
 After dinner she will do some clerical
 work then some work on the computer.  
 At 2:45 she has a coffee break and at 
 5:00 she clocks off work and walks    
 home but sometimes she is given a lift
 home.When she gets home she has a cup 
 of tea,then she makes the tea.When    
 everybody has eaten she washes up     
 then she watches the television and   
 does household jobs.At 9:30 she may   
 take a nap but wakes up in time to get
 the supper ready.At about 11:30 she   
 goes to bed.
