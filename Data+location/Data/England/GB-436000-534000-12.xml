		<content> IN MY SPARE TIME I LIKE TO PRACTICE   
 SWIMMING AS OFTEN AS I CAN.I GO TO    
 FISHBURN BATHS AND I TRAVEL BY BUS    
 WHICH COSTS 8p SO IT IS CHEAP BECAUSE 
 IT IS ONLY A MILE AWAY.IT IS DIFFICULT
 TO DESCRIBE HOW TO ACTUALLY SWIM.TO   
 SWIM YOU SWING ONE ARM ROUND AND THEN 
 THE OTHER BUT BOTH ARMS HAVE TO SWING 
 AT DIFFERENT TIMES OTHERWISE YOU WOULD
 SINK.YOU MUST KEEP YOUR FINGERS       
 TOGETHER ON EACH HAND, AND YOU KICK   
 YOUR LEGS UP AND DOWN IF YOU DO ALL   
 THAT TOGETHER IT MAKES A STROKE CALLED
 FRONT CRAWL.ALSO IN FRONT CRAWL YOU   
 MUST PUT YOUR HEAD IN OR YOUR BODY    
 ISN'T STRAIGHT AND HALF OF YOUR BODY  
 IS LOPSIDED AND YOU SINK.THERE ARE    
 MANY DIFFERENT AWARDS TO GET FOR      
 SWIMMING AND MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF  
 STROKES, FOR EXAMPLE, BREAST STROKE   
 AND BUTTERFLY.IN BUTTERFLY YOU SWING  
 BOTH ARMS AT THE SAME TIME.S. FISHBURN</content>
