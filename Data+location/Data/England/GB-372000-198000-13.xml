 We had{96}returns to our questionaire.
 There were some very interesting      
 details about people who live in our  
 area.{81}dads work full-time and{2}   
 part-time. More mums work full-time   
 than part-time, but we did count      
 housewives as having a full-time      
 occupation. Most people owned their   
 own home and only{19}rented. When     
 asked if they thought Dursley was a   
 good shopping centre only{1}said "yes"
 and most did not think it adequate.   
 People complain about bus services,   
 but no men used them to go to work and
 only{2}women. Cars are the most       
 popular form of transport.            
 We thought it was very strange that   
 the third most popular electrical item
 in the home was a computer.A          
 television is in every home, but only{
{13 }homes have a dishwasher.          </content>
