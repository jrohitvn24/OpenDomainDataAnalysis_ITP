		<content>     The farmers in our area told us   
 they see these animals often on their 
 farmland:- rabbits,badgers,foxes,     
 hedgehogs,hares,rats,mice and bats.   
     These animals were seen less      
 often:- stoats,weasels,pheasants and  
 grey squirrels.                       
     The farmers also told us that they
 saw these special plants and animals:-
 mink,deer,dragonflies,wild flowers,   
 wild duck,and some small evergreen    
 oak.                                  
     One farmer had milk thistles on   
 his land and a magnificent walnut     
 tree. We were suprised but happy to   
 see that ten  farmers out of sixteen  
 had seen barn owls regulary.
