		<title>01Introducing the area</title>
		<content>   This is a{low lying rural area      
 within the{flood plain}of the river   
 Yeo. Annual flooding has maintained   
{rich meadowlands}for dairy cattle but 
 has created a serious problem for     
 those people of Ilchester living      
 nearest the river who have many times 
 experienced flooded homes. A recent   
{flood prevention scheme,}ringing the  
 village with drainage pipes and       
 embankments has hopefully overcome    
 this problem; while a{by-pass}has     
 returned the village to normal after  
 years of increasingly congested roads.
   A feeling of{community}is prevalent 
 with village fairs and fetes in the   
 summer and a well supported school    
 pantomime at Christmas. A Historical  
 Society digs into the past.           
   The following pages have been       
 compiled by the pupils of Ilchester   
 primary school.                       </content>
