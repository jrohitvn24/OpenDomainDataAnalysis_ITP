		<title>18A LITTLEPORT SMALLHOLDING</title>
		<content> It is situated on the outskirts of    
 Littleport on flat low land on Camel  
 Road. The 64 acre farm has been{arable
 as long as Mr. Jeffreys has owned it. 
 (15 years). He employs five casual    
 labourers to help during the busy     
 times. He works as much as thirteen   
 hours per day.                        
 The farm owns four tractors at about  
 Â£20,000 each, a combine harvester     
 (Â£50,000), and many other{machines,   
 including a beet and potato harvester,
 beet loaders and crawlers.            
{The land}is mainly heavy silt and     
 light clay. It has been drained with  
 pipes, which run into ditches.        
 Wheat is used for making such items as
 biscuits, potatoes are stored in a    
 shed and chitted to be planted again  
 and sugar beet is sent to the British 
 Sugar Corporation factory at Wissey to
 the north, where it is refined.       </content>
