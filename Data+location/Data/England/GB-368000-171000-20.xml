		<title>20Round About Wick</title>
		<content> In a field to the left of the church  
 there was an old mill now used as     
 flats.                                
    Nearby there was a natural wood    
 with many different types of trees.   
 This means that it has grown up since 
 the war. Fields of over 100 years old 
 would have been one field are now many
 smaller meadows. Mr Upward owns all   
 the land around.                      
    The fields are used for Wheat,     
 Barley and fruit and nut trees. In the
 hedgerows there is a rich variety of  
 growth.                               
    Nearby is the sewage works and 200 
 metres away is a mansion called"The   
 Manor House".                         
    Also in Wick there are a few       
 factories called Plasticfilm and      
 Runacres.
