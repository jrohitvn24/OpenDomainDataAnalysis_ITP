		<content> This thriving,50 strong,non-political 
 and non-sectarian society has as its  
 motto"For Home and Country".Its mem-  
 bers ages range from 14 to 80.Its mai 
 -n aim is to educate and provide soci-
 al and recreational activities.To this
 end monthly meetings are held during  
 which talks,lectures and demonstratio-
 ns are given on subjects as varied as 
 cookery,health education,travel and   
 social concerns.Amongst the latter are
 drug abuse,child abuse,death grants,  
 the decline of rural bus routes,trad- 
 ing standards etc.Competitions,shows, 
 classes and courses often result from 
 these meetings.Last year,for example, 
 we entered the Cheshire County Show   
 and won the Silver Cup for Crafts whic
 -h led to our being invited to repres 
 -ent Cheshire at the Royal Show.The   
 membership enjoy taking part in as    
 many activities as possible.          </content>
