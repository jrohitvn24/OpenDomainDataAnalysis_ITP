		<content>{Hampstead Heath}covers a large area of
 this block. It is a mixture of rough  
 grassland and wooded areas, and is    
 enjoyed by a great many Londoners.    
   There are several old and famous    
{Inns}on the Heath like the{Bull and   
{Bush, Jack Straws Castle}and the      
{Spaniards Inn}and huge fairs have been
 held there for centuries.             
   One part of the Heath is called     
{Parliament Hill}and from the top you  
 can get a wonderful view of London.   
 Lots of people gather here to fly     
 kites and in the winter to go         
 toboganning.                          
   There are also several ponds on the 
 Heath which are used for swimming and 
 model boat sailing.                   
   During the summer months concerts   
 are held by the lake in the grounds of
{Kenwood House,}and are sometimes      
 accompanied by firework displays.     </content>
