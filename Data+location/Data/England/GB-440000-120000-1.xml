 Three schools co-operated in surveying
 the Chandler's Ford D-Block.          
                                       
 They were The Swithun Wells Primary   
           Scantabout Primary    and   
           Hiltingbury Junior.         
                                       
 Each school took charge of a 1 by 4   
 kilometre strip and then shared the   
 preparation of the final entry.       
                                       
                                       
 We would like to thank all those who

 businesses, shops and all residents.  
 We also thank the teachers, parents
