		<title>12Hatfield Broad Oak Farms: 1</title>
		<content>{     Information derived from an      
{    interview with a local farmer.    
   The local farms of today represent  
 amalgamations of several smaller farms
 of earlier times.  For instance, the  
 farm now run by one family consortium 
 comprises land formerly part of four  
 separate farms: Anthonys, Benningtons,
 Waters and Rolls (the last comprising 
 a few fields at Hatfield Heath). This 
 means that the fields are not all     
 grouped together but are somewhat     
 scattered. They are partly owned and  
 partly rented.                        
   The main crop is wheat, for which   
 this part of Essex is well-known, but 
 barley, rape, peas, beans and sugar   
 beet are also grown, the last three   
 forming useful 'break' crops in a     
 rotation cycle. In addition, the farm 
 has a small herd of meat cattle and   
 some sheep.                           </content>
