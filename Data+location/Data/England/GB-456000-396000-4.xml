		<content> Little is known about the earlier     
 buildings which stood on this site.   
 The present Georgian Mansion was built
 by a family called Wordsworth.        
 Building commenced between 1745 and   
 1750.The architect is believed to be  
 James Paine the same person who       
 designed Nostel Priory and the Mansion
 House in Doncaster.The entrance leads 
 you straight into the forecourt with  
 two houses at either side.The houses  
 are two storey pavilions with blanked 
 arch windows and doorways looking at  
 each other across the forecourt.The   
 drain-pipes are decorated with        
 animals, which have survived over the 
 years.The symmetry is very good,but   
 the side of the house looks odd as    
 though another piece was added on.In  
 1957 it was bought to use as a home   
 for the aged.Now it is used as offices
 by T.J.Johnson architects.            </content>
