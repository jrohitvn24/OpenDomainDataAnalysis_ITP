		<content>    An underground system was begun in 
 the '70s to connect bus stations and  
 to key city  points.  It continues as 
 the old district BR system at the edge
 of the centre.  Two{tunnels}were made.
    The N-S tunnel goes underground at 
{Jesmond}to{Haymarket}(Univ, Poly,     
 Hosp.) under the shopping complex to {
{Monument}(shops, theatres) and beyond 
 the CBD to the BR station and a new   
 river bridge (S of our area).         
    The W-E line starts at{St James}   
 (Soccer ground and coach Sta.) crosses
 at{Monument}(2 level interchange) and 
 runs on a long new surface viaduct to 
 Byker.                                
    Bright, fast, stay-clean and easy  
 to use it is popular and liked.  Most 
 important points are near a station   
 and it is easy to plan town trips.  It
 has a good reliability record and     
 fares are low although costs are high.</content>
