		<content>   We interviewed Constable Farrily our
 school policeman and Constable Jonston
 our community policman.The police we  
 talked to covered a large area.There  
 are about 4,500 police in Merseyside, 
 about 250 are women.                  
  We had, until a few months ago, a    
{ Police Band}.We spoke to Mr Peters   
 (one of our school Governers)from the 
 Police Band.He told us that there were
 9 different types of instruments      
 played by 22 police members.          
  At our school 12 pupils are doing a{ 
{Civic Award Scheme.}This involves     
 talks  and visits,caring for people,  
 being self reliant and working hard at
 certain skills.                       
   For our Civic Award we are doing a  
 Police Project we had a visit to the  
 police station were we saw lots of    
 things including the dogs,cells and   
 law courts.                           </content>
