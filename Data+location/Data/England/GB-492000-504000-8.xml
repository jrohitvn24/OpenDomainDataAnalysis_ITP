		<title>08FARMING IN FYLINGDALES</title>
		<content> COWS. There are about six different   
 breeds kept in Fylingdales.           
 The two most common ones are the      
 Friesians, which are kept for their   
 milk and Charolais which are used for 
 beef. The local Herefords are kept for
 breeding and beef.                    
 Each year the dairy Friesians have a  
 calf. If it is a heifer it is kept for
 milking but if it is a bull calf it is
 sold to be fattened up for            
 slaughtering.                         
 Simmentals and Limousins are foreign  
 breeds which farmers use to increase  
 the size of their animals.            
 The Blue Grays are a cross. They are a
 hardy breed because they eat sparse   
 grass and can live on either the hills
 or the moors.
