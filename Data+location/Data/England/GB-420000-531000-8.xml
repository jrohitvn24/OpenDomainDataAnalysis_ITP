		<content> 1. Binchester Roman Fort (Vinovia).   
    Just off the B.Auckland to Newfield
 road in the S.W. corner of block0420_ 
 0531 lies the Roman fort of Vinovium. 
 This fort was built by Julius Agricola
 during his northern campaigns A.D.79_ 
 84, and remained in intermittant use  
 until the 5thC. Garrisoned originally 
 to protect the important Roman road of
 Dere Street_part of which can be seen 
 excavated in the fort_ archaeological 
 evidence now points to a changing role
 Of particular interest is the well_   
 preserved and exstensive hypocaust now
 covered by a timber_framed building.  
 Much of this site remains unexcavated.
 2. Westerton Folly.                   
    Looking rather like a watchtower,it
 was built by Thomas Wright in 1811. He
 did not live to finish it, but never_ 
 theless is a conspicuous landmark for 
 many miles around.                    </content>
