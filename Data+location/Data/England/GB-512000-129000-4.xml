		<title>04BROADBRIDGE HEATH BYPASS</title>
		<content>   At the beginning of 1982 a bypass   
 was built avoiding the small village, 
{Broadbridge Heath.}Before the bypass  
 the village was busy and dangerous for
 the residents.Since the bypass many   
 improvements have taken place, plus   
 the development of new houses.{       
   This bypass has not only made the   
 village quieter and safer but also    
 resulted in a{30% increase in trade   
 for the{village post office.}This     
 increase is because the villagers can 
 pull in and out of the layby quickly  
 without having to wait to get back    
 into the stream of traffic as before. 
 Many things are sold here thus saving 
 many pensioners expensive trips to    
 Horsham.                              
   The{petrol station}has suffered the 
 most with{trade dropping considerably 
 and the ownership has changed twice   
 since the building of the bypass.     </content>
