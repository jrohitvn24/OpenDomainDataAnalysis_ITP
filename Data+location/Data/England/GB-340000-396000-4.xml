 the M57 which joins to the M62 which  
 is the main road route from Liverpool 
 to Manchester and Leeds. The M62 also 
 joins the M6 which is the main        
 routeway to the north and the opposite
 direction the the midlands and the    
 south. The main road through Kirkby is
 County Road which joins the East      
 Lancashire Road. This used to be the  
 main road joining Liverpool to        
 Manchester before the motorways were  
 built.

 Liverpool via Fazakerley and Rice
