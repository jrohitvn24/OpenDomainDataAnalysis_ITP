		<title>17TOURISM IN MARSKE AREA.</title>
		<content> Part of the area is in the Dales      
 National Park land. Tourism has       
 increased over the past ten years, the
 area becoming known as 'Herriot       
 Country' following the T.V. series of 
 veterinary stories set in the         
 Yorkshire Dales. There are 9 holiday  
 cottages and 3 houses doing Bed and   
 Breakfast. Most tourists come to enjoy
 walking in the area, which is on the  
 Coast to Coast route from Bee's Head  
 to Robin Hood's Bay. A number of      
 motorists come to enjoy the landscape 
 &amp; to visit the 2 Churches &amp; 1 Chapel  
 in the area. The Methodist Chapel at  
 Clints was once a Roman Catholic      
 Chapel. St Edmund's Church in Marske  
 is a Norman Church. There is St       
 Michael's Church in Downholme. A      
 monument to Capt. Matthew Hutton,     
 errected in 1814 on the Deerpark      
 dominates the landscape.              </content>
