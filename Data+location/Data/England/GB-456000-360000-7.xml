 one of our local pits.Mining is the   
 main job in our area.Some people work 
 in an office or a shop.There is a     
 removel firm where you could get a job

 undertakers in Forest Town where you  
 could get a job.For people who cannot 
 find a job in Forest Town they have to
 go to work in nearby towns and cities.
      The shopping in Forest Town is   
 good for the size of it.For food you  
 will not need to go very far because  
 there is a Tesco's hypermarket and the
 little food shops.There is a post     
 office and butchers and bakers.In     
 Forest Town there is a fishing shop   
 which is the only one in the area.    
 People from miles away come to it     
 because it is very good,maybe the best
