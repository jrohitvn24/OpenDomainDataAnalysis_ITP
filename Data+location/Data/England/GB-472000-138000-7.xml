   {Kings pond}is near the{Industrial  
{Estate. }By the pond there is an old  
{paper mill}and there's a road nearby  
 called Paper Mill Lane.               
                                       
    Kings pond is now open to the      
 public, and there are{ducks}and{swans 
 which people feed. Kings pond is a    
 very nice place to go for a walk and  
 there's a lot of nature near it,      
 especially at the back of it where    
 there are{butterflies}and{birds.      
{                                      
{  }Water from Kings Pond was used in  
 paper making for the industrial       
 estate.  There's a sign warning about 
 ducks and swans because so many have  
 been killed by traffic passing by.
