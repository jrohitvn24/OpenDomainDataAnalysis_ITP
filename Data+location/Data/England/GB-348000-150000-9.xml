		<content> The village has changed in recent     
 years as with many settlements within 
 commuting range of Bristol (approx. 22
 miles away). Although these changes   
 are distinctive they are not as       
 pronounced as in neighbouring         
 springline villages such as           
  heddar.New building has been         
 restricted to in-filling and the      
 Parish population (includes Draycott  
 to the west) increased by 10.7%       
 between 1971 and 1981. (17% between   
 1961 and 1971) The resident population
 in 1981 was 985 and the Somerset      
 County Council  Structure Plan will   
 only permit in-filling in order to    
 preserve the villages rural charm. The
 increased mobility in society means   
 however ,that more and more newcomers 
 are living here.These people commute  
 to towns like Bristol.Older people    
 resent the changes occuring.          </content>
