 813 people work at the colliery, of   
 which 250 come from Whitwell.         
 14,000 tonnes of stone are taken out  
 of the colliery weekly.About half of  
 the output each week goes to the power
 stations and the rest goes to         
 industry.Lorries take coal to all     
 parts of the country.The seams arein  
 the concealed part of the Yorks.      
 Derbys.Notts. coalfield. Measures are 
 limited and the unconfirmed belief is 
 that the pit will not be working in   
 ten years time. The men work seven    
 and a quarter hour shifts underground,
 and eight hours on the surface.The    
 only complaints they receive are about
 the dust.The colliery has two clubs   
 connected, which are the football and 
 cricket club. One person has been     
 killed underground in the last ten    
 years.                                </content>
