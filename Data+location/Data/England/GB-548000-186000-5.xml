		<title>05A STUDY OF THE RAILWAY</title>
		<content>  A section of the main railway line   
 between London Liverpool Street and   
 East Anglia is in our area.Our        
 surveys  were carried out during the  
 morning,afternoon and early evening   
 in half-hour sessions.                
   In the morning there were only a few
 trains from London,but they passed    
 every 2 minutes to London.By mid-     
 afternoon trains were travelling from 
 London every 5 minutes and to London  
 every 3 minutes.The trains were still 
 frequent probably to cater for        
 shoppers and visitors to London.      
   Early evening was the busiest       
 time.Trains were coming from London   
 every 1 or 2 minutes.These trains     
 bring workers home from London to the 
 eastern suburbs as  well as shoppers  
 and visitors.                         
  A new feature on the line since      
 May 1985 is the faster electric train.</content>
