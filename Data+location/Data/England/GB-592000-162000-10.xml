 Lacron is a firm which makes filters  
 and spa baths. The workshops are con- 
 verted oasthouses on the A2 in Teyn-  
 ham. The filters are used for agri-   
 culture, fish farming and swimming    
 pools. 80% of the production is ex-   
 ported.The largest filters cost Â£1500.
 Most use silica sand but occasionally 
 anthracite or coral sand is used. Each
 filter is pressure tested. About 100  
 filters are produced each day.They are
 made of fibreglass which is hand cut. 
 Their main rivals are American firms. 
 Lacron started in Teynham in 1970. It 
 has 50 employees and is expanding. Spa
 baths are a recent development made in
 a new building. 80% are exported. The 
 most expensive spa bath has gold plat-
 ed taps and sells for about Â£3000. The
 workforce usually work from 8am to 6pm
 but this varies according to demand.  </content>
