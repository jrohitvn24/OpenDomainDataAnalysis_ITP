		<title>01A SUMMARY OF THE BLOCK 1.</title>
		<content>  Our 4x3km block is mostly farmland.We
 also have some residential areas.Some 
 of{New Waltham}is in the block but    
 mostly the north part.The south part  
 of Cleethorpes and a little piece of  
 Grimsby are in the north part of the  
 block.Most of Humberston is in the    
 south east of the block.There is a    
 disused railway that runs through the 
 south west corner of the block.The    
 railway runs between Grimsby and      
 Louth.There is a preservation society 
 that wants to bring back the railway  
 and they want to put trains back on   
 the tracks.                           
  The road that runs from New Waltham  
 to Cleethorpes is the A1098.There are 
 two main roads running through the    
 block the A1098 and the A1031.These   
 roads become especailly busy in the   
 morning and night because people use  
 them to go to work and come home.     </content>
