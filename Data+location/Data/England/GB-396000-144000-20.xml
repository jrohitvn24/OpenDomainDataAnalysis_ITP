		<title>20HOUSING IN CHITTERNE</title>
		<content> In the West Wiltshire Rural District  
 Policy Statement, Chitterne qualifies 
 for limited residential development.  
 The local view is that small scale    
 housing should be encouraged and the  
 Structure Plan for the area allows for
 infill housing only. House prices are 
 increasing and a few properties are on
 the market. There are several quite   
 large old houses in this northern part
 of Chitterne, one having been built as
 a 17th Century hunting lodge, and     
 another includes the remnants of a    
 16th Century Priory and St. Andrew's  
 Chapel, with a stone arched gateway   
 into the courtyard. Nearly all the    
 houses are privately owned although   
 there are some Local Aurhority and    
 Ministry of Defence houses on lease.
