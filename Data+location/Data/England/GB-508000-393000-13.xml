		<title>13RECREATION IN THE AREA</title>
		<content> There are very few facilities in the  
 immediate area and therefore many of  
 the recreational activities take place
 in and around the home. These include 
 knitting, sewing, gardening, reading, 
 music and Do-it-Yourself. In addition 
 other interests include beekeeping,   
 ferreting, shooting and walking.      
 There are not any public houses in the
 villages nor any sports clubs. The    
 only social meeting place is the old  
 Methodist Chapel now owned by the     
 Women's Institute, Claxby/Normanby-   
 le-Wold. This is used as a Polling    
 Station at election time.             
 Outdoor facilities for children's     
 entertainment are also few, the main  
 one being swings provided on a playing
 field on the edge of Claxby village.
