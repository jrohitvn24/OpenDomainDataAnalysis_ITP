		<title>13SHREWTON FARM BY A LOCAL LAD</title>
		<content> I live on Shrewton Farm in a cottage  
 with my Mum, Dad and two brothers.    
 My Dad looks after 100 fresian cows.  
 He milks them twice a day at 5 O'clock
 in the morning and 3 O'clock in the   
 afternoon. Some of the cattle are dry 
 cows waiting to have their calves, and
 they are in a field near our house.   
 My brothers and I, we see all the new 
 calves when they are born.            
 Ian feeds the calves when their mums  
 go back to the herd for milking.      
 Mr. Grant the farmer grows many acres 
 of silage hay, corn and grass to feed 
 the cows.                             
 There is a lot of machinery for the   
 land work. There are seven tractors,  
 three combine harvesters, ploughs and 
 many other things.                    
 I like living on a farm!
