		<title>15CHOIR AND CHOIR PRACTICE</title>
		<content> Every Sunday I go to church and walk  
 up into the choir stalls in front of  
 the congregation. As soon as we are in
 the choir stalls we sing a hymn. We   
 sometimes sing a psalm but not often. 
 Then we listen to the readings. After 
 the readings we have prayers and pray 
 for other people in the world.        
 After the service we have to put      
 all the books away for Wednesday and  
 Thursday when it is choir practice.   
 On Wednesdays the junior choir have   
 their practice and on Thursday the    
 seniors have theirs. We have          
 choir practice so that we know what we
 have to sing on Sunday.               
 I like singing and enjoy being in the 
 choir.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
