		<title>08LILLESHALL ABBEY PONDS</title>
		<content> There are three ponds at the{Abbey.   
 They are not used any more but they   
 used to be in use before 1547 by the  
 monks before they were told or forced 
 to leave the{Abbey.}Each pond was     
 filled with fish. They were caught and
 eaten for dinner and supper.Two of the
 ponds are quite near to the{Abbey}but 
 the third is nearer to{Lilleshall     
 Grange.All the ponds are quite big but
 the pond by the Grange is a lot bigger
 than the other two.After the monks had
 left the{monastery}the ponds were     
 abandoned. Now they, like all the     
 rest of the Abbey ruins are only      
 places to visit.
