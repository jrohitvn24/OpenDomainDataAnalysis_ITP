		<content>  Mr. Green is our headteacher. He has 
 lived in Sharlston on and off for 37  
 years. Mr. Green first went to        
 Sharlston School (that is the school I
 go to). He later passed a test and    
 went to grammar school. We asked Mr.  
 Green if the school had changed much. 
 He said that the age range had changed
 because then children started at 5 and
 left at 14. Also children did more    
 work from the blackboard and always   
 sat in rows. Like many boys, he had   
 very short hair with a long fringe at 
 the front.Boys wore short trousers and
 sometimes clothes handed down from    
 older children. He thought children   
 were more confident today. The only   
 thing he would bring back from the    
 past was the countryside.
