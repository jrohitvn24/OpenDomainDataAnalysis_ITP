 St.John's C.E. First School, Bishops  
 Wood was opened in 1969.  At          
 present there are 71 children in the  
 school and three full time staff and  
 one part-time.                        
 The children wear red and grey        
 unifoms.  Some children travel to     
 school from the surrounding villages  
 in a mini-bus.  There are three       
 classes in the school.  The atmosphere
 is a very happy, friendly one.        
 The school is rural and this allows   
 the children to use the local area for
 walks, projects and so on.            
 Parents often come into school to help
 with story-time, baking and on visits.
 Altogether the school is an important 
 part of village life.
