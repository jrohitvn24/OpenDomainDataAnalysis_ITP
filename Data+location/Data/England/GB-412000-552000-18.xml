{to the main towns such as Consett,    
{Stanley,Newcastle,&amp; Durham.The maj. of
{children in our block travel to school
{by bus.Others use cars,taxis,or walk. 
                                       
 As we have no railway station here,we 
 must go to Durham or Newcastle if we  
 wish to catch a Train to any part of  
 the country.....by LISA THOMPSON.
