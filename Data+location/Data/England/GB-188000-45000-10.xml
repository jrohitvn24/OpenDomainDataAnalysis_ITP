		<title>10FARMING AROUND PROBUS</title>
		<content>{Farming around Probus}                
 Most of this area is farmland,with    
 farms mainly consisting of 200 acres  
 or more.The smaller farms are being   
 put out of business by the larger ones
 Three farms are taken as examples.The 
 smallest has 200 acres of mixed farm  
 land,which has been in the same family
 for about 50 years.Three workers are  
 employed &amp; they concentrate on beef,  
 with about 50 cattle,&amp; lamb,with about
 200 sheep.About 20 acres are for      
 silage,40 acres for hay &amp; about acres 
 for straw,so the farm is generally    
 self-sufficient.The silage is dealt   
 with by a contractor to save buying   
 special machinery.The cattle and sheep
 are either sold in Truro market or go 
 to the abbatoir at Probus.
