		<content>   I am lucky because my parents can   
 afford a house,but some people...have 
 to live in the tall storey flats.     
 (Girl, 11yrs,Walkergate).             
   I don't think people believe in the 
 Church as they used to, because hardly
 any go.   (Vicar,Hebburn).            
   From almost all interviewees came   
 satisfaction with living in 1985 in   
 the area because of the friendliness  
 of neighbours and a feeling of        
 community spirit.Dissatisfaction was  
 occasioned by graffiti,vandalism,the  
 crime-rate in general (particularly   
 violence), children's swearing in the 
 street,limited employment prospects,  
 poor working conditions and the high  
 cost of living.Improvements suggested 
 were a more convenient supermarket in 
 the housing estates,a disco,an ice    
 rink and a change of Government.
