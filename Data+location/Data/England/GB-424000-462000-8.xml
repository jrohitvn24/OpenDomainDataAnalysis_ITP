		<content> The Church of England school was built
 upon a piece of land, part of the     
 wastes of the manor of Thornton, which
 was given for that purpose by the     
 Archbishop of York to 7 persons as    
 trustees at a rent of 1 shilling a    
 year at a court held on 1st June 1832.
 The first records we have is in the   
 school log book when the Headmaster,  
 James Moss opened the school in 1873  
 when 13 boys and 9 girls were on roll.
 By 1897 the number on roll was 71     
 children. The school must have been   
 very crowded. There are 25 children on
 roll at the present day, 1985,        
 Headteacher Mrs. Hazel Stoyles.       
 Assistant Teacher Mrs. Susan Partner. 
 There is also a Roman Catholic School 
 in the village opened in 1861, with 20
 children on roll at the present day.  
 Headteacher Mr. B.J.Bridson.
