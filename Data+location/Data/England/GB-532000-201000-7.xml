		<content> This survey was taken of 28 eight year
 olds. We found out that half of the   
 children have been unwell and have    
 been to the doctors surgery this year.
 A quarter of the class had the doctor 
 call at their house. Most of the class
 were born in hospital. This year      
 only two children visited the hospital
 to have stitches and none have stayed 
 in. One third of the class have had an
 x_ray this year. Everyone has had an  
 eye test and has been checked by the  
 school dentist. Nearly everyone has   
 been to the dentist, one third of     
 the children have had a filling and   
 the same number had a tooth out. We   
 found out that more than half the     
 children had sweets every day. Half of
 the children have hurt themselves on  
 their bikes. Children have been ill   
 more often than their mums and dads.
