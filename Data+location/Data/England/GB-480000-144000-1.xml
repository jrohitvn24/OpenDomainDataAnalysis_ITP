		<title>01West Farnham - An Overview</title>
		<content> This D-Block straddles the Surrey/    
 Hampshire border. The west of the     
 block is mainly rural and             
 agricultural, the east of the area ,  
 administered by Waverley District     
 Council, is largely residential and   
 commercial.                           
 Running east and west, along the      
 valley of the River Wey, are the      
 main arteries of communication - the  
 A31 Farnham Bypass and the railway.   
 The Wey takes a meandering course     
 along a green flood plain with a      
 chalky incline to the north and gravel
 terraces to the south.                
 By the standards of the 1980's, this  
 is an affluent area. Unemployment is  
 low and the cost of property is high. 
 The town of Farnham as a whole has a  
 population of over 32,000.
