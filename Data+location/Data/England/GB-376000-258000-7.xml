		<title>07CHANGES IN WICHENFORD</title>
		<content>  There are many{elderly residents}in  
 Wichenford, some in their 80's and    
 even 90's. These people are content   
 living here, and eagerly recalled     
 their early days in Wichenford.       
  When the{council estate}was built in 
 1953, the village moved to its present
 site; earlier, the hub of life was on 
{Castle Hill,}where the one pub, the   
 Mason's Arms, still stands.           
  0lder people remember a variety of   
{farming,}including: sugar beet, field 
 beans, potatoes, and poultry; and     
 several remembered the{first tractors.
{ War time}bears special memories of   
{evacuees}coming from London,{rationing
 of food, and{special war time duties. 
  One lady remebers being{"in service" 
 a career remote to today's youngsters.
  Most people regretted the effects of 
 the{closure of the school}and the{loss
{of a resident vicar}in the Village.   </content>
