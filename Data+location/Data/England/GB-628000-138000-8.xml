		<content> Dover is on the South East tip of     
 Great Britain. It is near the         
 continent and it gives protection     
 to ships in the strait, because of the
 cleft in the hills.                   
                                       
 Romans used Dover the evidence exists 
 in the form of the "Pharos", or       
 lighthouse, on the cliffs of the east 
 side of the valley.                   
                                       
 During the late Saxon period the River
 Dour became greatly silted and the    
 shipyard, which was situated in the   
 estuary, was transferred to a point   
 below the Western cliffs. King Henry  
 VIII was interested in improving the  
 harbour and ordered that a pier be    
 built. However, the pier caused       
 frequent deposits of shingle across   
 the entrance.
