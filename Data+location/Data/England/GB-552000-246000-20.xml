		<content> Beauty in 1985 is very important in   
 the life of men and women.Hairdress-  
 ers,cosmetics and clothes shops get a 
 lot of money from people wanting to   
 look beautiful and fashionable.Punk   
 hair styles are very popular with peo-
 ple between the ages of 15-18.They so-
 metimes consist of many bright colours
 Cosmetics and make up are for the face
 There is mascara to darken the eyes,  
 and  lipstick and blusher .           
 The pop music of today is mainly elec-
 tronic.Electric guitars and organs are
 used to make the most lively sounds.  
 Synthethisers are also used to make   
 sounds  different,like making a piano 
 sound  like a guitar.Some records are 
 made to raise money to help charities.
 Some songs have many words repeated in
 a rhythm like a chorus.Words in the   
 background usually fade away at the   
 end.                                  </content>
