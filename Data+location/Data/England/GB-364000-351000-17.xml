 two centuries old in Nantwich.The     
{Central Methodist Church}was built in 
 1808 after the successful visits of   
{John Wesley.}A flourishing Day School 
 and Sunday School faltered after a    
 fire. The present schoolrooms are used
 by the Junior Church and various      
 community groups.The Welsh Row Church,
 built 150 years ago as a Primitive    
 Methodist Chapel,merged with the      
 former Wesleyan Circuit and now heads 
 the Nantwich Circuit of 22 churches.

 St.Anne's,part of Nantwich since 1855,
 now has a small modern church.Services
