 We spoke to the farmer's wife and she 
 told us that her husband had lived at 
 Volis Farm since 1911; she moved there
 in 1950. It has 200 acres of cereal - 
 mainly barley - and 100 acres of      
 grass. They have beef cattle, but no  
 dairy cattle. The soil is a light     
 sandy colour and the land is very     
 hilly. The farmer has one assistant   
 and in the summer his wife helps with 
 the harvest. They do not have holidays
 because they do not want anyone to    
 look after the farm. The farmer has   
 four tractors; many years ago they    
 used horses. The farmer's wife is     
 happy living there. The only other    
 place she would like to live is       
 Bagborough. She shops in Taunton.     
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
