		<content> My name is Melissa Bennett and I live 
 on Kitwell Estate.                    
           In our house we have seven  
 rooms and four cupboards.Three rooms  
 are bedrooms and the other rooms are  
 the living room,kitchen,bathroom and  
 boiler room.                          
           In our house there is a loft
 to keep things in like old prams and  
 carry-cots which we don't use anymore.
             Our backgarden is about   
 five metres by seven metres.We have   
 one swing,four small evergreen trees  
 and a shed in the corner.Our garden is
 mostly grass.In one corner there are  
 some slabs for the window cleaner to  
 put his ladder on so that he does not 
 ruin our garden.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
