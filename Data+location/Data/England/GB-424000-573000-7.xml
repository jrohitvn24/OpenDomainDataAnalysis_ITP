Watching TV is a popular hobby among   
children. We found that the type of    
programme most popular were those shown
on childrens TV, such as " Inspector   
Gadget".Series imported from America   
such as "A-Team" were very popular.    
Sport was a favourite amongst boys, but
few girls watched it.Comedy shows and  
soap operas such as "Eastenders"were   
watched by both boys and girls.Chat    
shows such as "Wogan" were only        
moderatly popular. Few children watched
news or current affairs. Not many were 
interested in nature series or drama.  
Nearly half the people interviewed had 
a home video and the most popular      
viewing was home recorded programmes.  
May people borrowed tapes from video   
hire shops.
