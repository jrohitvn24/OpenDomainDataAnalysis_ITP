		<title>04Canal Inspector - Watford.</title>
		<content>Mr Patterson lives in a cottage at     
lock 72 on the Grand Union Canal. He   
works for the Waterways Board as an    
Inspector. He started at 15 as a       
carpenter. In 1939/45 he fought in the 
war then he returned to canal work.    
Lock keepers are now called            
lengthsmen. Mr Patterson is now an     
inspector.  He looks after 5-7 miles   
of canal. He works for 39 hours a      
week. The lengthsman, formally known   
as the lock-keeper, checks to see if   
the banks are safe and the locks       
navigable. As Inspector he has office  
work to do in Hemel Hempstead. The     
canal nowadays is used only for        
pleasure and fishing. There are no     
commercial boats now.  It is too       
expensive.  The lorry is much faster   
and cheaper for carrying goods. In the 
past the narrow boats carried wheat,   
coal, copper, corn, sand, and sugar.   </content>
