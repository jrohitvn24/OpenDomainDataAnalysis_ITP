		<title>08The Miner's strike 1984-5</title>
		<content>    During the miner's strike there    
 were a lot of arguments in our house  
 about money and bills. My mother does 
 not go out to work and my brother and 
 father are both miners. They were at  
 home most of the day watching T.V.    
    One of the many miners who live on 
 our street was a working miner. People
 wrote 'scab' on his wall and no-one   
 talked to him or his family.          
    During the strike my pocket-money  
 was cut from Â£2.50 to Â£1 and instead  
 of going out three times a week my    
 parents only went out twice a month.  
    On my birthday my two sisters paid 
 for the family to go out for a meal   
 but at Christmas instead of a turkey  
 we had a chicken and I hardly got any 
 presents.                             
    My dad did not want to go back to  
 work after the strike because his pit,
{Kilnhurst,}was threatened with closure</content>
