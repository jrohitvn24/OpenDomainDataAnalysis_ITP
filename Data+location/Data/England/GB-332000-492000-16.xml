		<content>    There is a small lake in Grizedale 
 called Grizedale Tarn. It is about 60 
 feet deep in the middle and turns     
 round anti_clockwise very slowly. When
 you drop a matchstick in the tarn it  
 takes three and a quarter hours before
 the matchstick gets back to its       
 original place if there is no wind.   
 The tarn never loses its water level  
 because there is a spring under it.   
    People have seen the{holly blue    
{butterfly}frequently in this area.    
{Lizards}and{woodpeckers}(green and    
 pied) live in the woods. The{sundew}  
 plant and the{sloworm}can be seen     
 occasionally. On its sticky stalks    
 the sundew plant catches flies which  
 come down to drink the juice.         
    Many kinds of fungi can be found in
 the autumn including the{fly agaric,} 
 the{chanterelle}and several types of  
{boletus}and{russula.                  </content>
