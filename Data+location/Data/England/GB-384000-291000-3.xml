		<content> {Kiss'n Catch}                        
We have two teams.One team is out and  
the other team has to chase them.(It   
is usually the boys who are out and the
girls chasing.)When one of the girls   
catches a boy,the girl has to kiss the 
boy on the cheek.Then she brings him to
den.We do that until the end of break. 
 {Skipping}                            
The girls skip over a long rope. When  
they jump we all sing skipping rhymes. 
The rope keeps up with the rhythm.     
 {Ball games}                          
The boys play football with tennis     
balls. They take off their blazers and 
use them for the goalposts. Sometimes  
the girls play rounders on the grass.  
Both boys and girls play Kingball. One 
person starts with the ball. He has to 
throw the ball at the others. If they  
are hit they help with the throwing.   
This continues until the King is left. </content>
