		<title>19THE COUNTRYMAN BUS</title>
		<content> The Countryman mini-bus was introduced
 in January 1981 to restore local bus  
 services to an acceptable level.      
 Management and operation of the scheme
 is performed by an Operating Group    
 comprising of the Local County        
 Councillor, representatives from local
 parish councils and officers of the   
 County Council, supported by voluntary
 drivers. Weekly services are provided 
 to Newark and Southwell on Wednesday  
 and Saturday respectively, from the   
 villages of Maplebeck, Kirklington,   
 Eakring, Winkburn and Hockerton. A    
 school service also runs from Eakring 
 to Kneesall on weekdays during term - 
 time. The vehicle is available for    
 private hire and is extensively used  
 by local youth clubs, Womens Insts.   
 and other organisations. Hire charges 
 and fares do not cover operating costs
 so there is a Local Authority subsidy.</content>
