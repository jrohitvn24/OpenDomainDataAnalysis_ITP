		<title>14VILLAGE  CRICKET</title>
		<content>       In the summer,weekends are busy 
 for my family.We go to the cricket    
 pitch at Windrush.The pitch is in a   
 field with trees near by. My mum      
 prepares the tea for the teams.My     
 brother and dad both play cricket for 
 Windrush cricket club.I usually       
 help by putting scores on the score   
 board and helping mum with the tea.We 
 prepare the tea at home, and make it  
 ready at the cricket pitch.We usually 
 make cakes and sandwiches, and drink  
 orange or cups of tea.Sometimes my    
 friend Donna, who lives in Windrush,  
 comes to the cricket pitch and        
 prepares the tea with us.When we have 
 finished we go to the nearby river to 
 fish for minnows.After the teams have 
 had their tea, we have ours.Then we go
 wandering in the fields.When we get   
 back the match has finished.We call at
 'The Fox Inn',before we go home.      </content>
