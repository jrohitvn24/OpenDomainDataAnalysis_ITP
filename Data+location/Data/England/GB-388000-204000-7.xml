		<content> There are many clubs and societies    
 operating the the village which enjoy 
 the support of different sections of  
 the population.  The main venue for   
 these groups is the W.I. Hall,a wooden
 building in the centre of the village.
 The Tuesday Club, a group of senior   
 citizens meets once a week for a      
 variety of activities.  The Womens'   
 Institute is a very well supported and
 central group to many other activities
 in the village like the Christmas     
 Panomime which has both male and      
 female actors.  For the young there is
 a youth club, Guides, Brownies and Red
 Cross.  A cricket club plays against  
 other villages on the playing field in
 the summer.  A group of enthusiastic  
 bellringers keep the church bells     
 going. The church has a small choir. A
 theatre visiting group go to plays at 
 Bath and Stratford.                   </content>
