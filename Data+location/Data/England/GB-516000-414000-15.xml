		<title>15St. Andrew's Church</title>
		<content> The Rev. Peter Hall showed us round   
 St. Andrew's which is just over 500   
 years old.On the outside there are    
 some the stones which go back to      
 Mediaeval times.There was also a      
 coffin lid set into the wall and some 
 gargoyles.While the foundations were  
 being dug for the boiler house lots of
 bones were found. Inside the church we
 saw the font where babies are         
 Christened. We were shown the church  
 records but they were not complete    
 because the oldest records were       
 stolen. St. Andrew's is the oldest    
 church in Immingham and all the old   
 maps of Immingham we have found show  
 the church.There is a legend that the 
 carving of a man showing his bottom to
 Killingholme was placed there when the
 people of Killingholme refused to help
 with the building of St.Andrew's.
