		<title>09Shopping In A Country Area</title>
		<content>  Most people do their food shopping in
 Northwich, Weaverham or Frodsham,     
 although surrounding Cheshire towns   
 are also used.  The village shops are 
 used more by older people and those   
 who do npt have a car.  Elderly people
 use the Post Office for their pension,
 and then they buy groceries and bread 
 in the shop.                          
  People go to buy food in Northwich   
 because it is a larger town and their 
 is more choice.  You can go to the    
 supermarket and buy a whole trolley   
 full of shopping and it is usually    
 cheaper than the village shop.  At the
 supermarket you can buy meat, fish,   
 wine, hardware, fruit and vegetables  
 and groceries.  My Mum goes shopping  
 to Northwich, Weaverham and Warrington
 and she uses the village shop for odd 
 items.
