 A large variety of different          
 employment was found although         
 principally in this area it is        
 agriculture                           
 80% are employed directly in farming  
 such as fruit growing,hop growing,    
 cereal growing, vegetable growing  or 
 as employees of Agricultural Suppliers
 such as seed merchants, chemical      
 suppliers, contractors, machinery     
 distributors, building contractors    
 haulage companies                     
 There are very few people employed in 
 livestock farming in this particular  
 area                                  
 Other forms of employment include     
 Company Directors usually based in the
 local towns some 10 miles away        
 Hospital staff based in the local     
 towns some 10 miles distant
