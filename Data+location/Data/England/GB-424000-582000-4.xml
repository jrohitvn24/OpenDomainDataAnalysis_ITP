      On our visit to Bells of         
 Ashington on the Barrington Industrial
 Site we discovered that they sell     
 trucks and wagons as well as use them.
 This part of the business is Bells    
 Truck Sales.  They deal with buyers   
 from all over Northumberland and Tyne 
 and Wear.  All the trucks they sell   
 are made by Mercedes Benz of Stuttgart
 South Germany.  Mr Bell has a good    
 working relationship with this firm   
 and has traded with them for 11 years.
      There is a large range of trucks 
 to choose from as well as minibuses   
 which Mr Bell says are popular with   
 the schools.  Spare parts to repair   
 engines and body panels on damaged    
 trucks are found in a large store     
 house.  Again the computers are use-  
 ful for keeping a file on parts used. </content>
