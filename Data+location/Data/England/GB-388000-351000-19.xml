		<title>19A Typical Norton Family,1985</title>
		<content>The typical family consists of two     
adults and two children. Shopping for  
the family is done on a Thursday or a  
Friday at the local supermarket. Mother
may take one or both children with her,
but Father only goes shopping          
occasionally. Some items of shopping   
are obtained from local shops but not  
on a regular basis.                    
The family usually takes its summer    
holidays in the United Kingdom.  Self  
catering holidays are very popular as  
well as being cheaper.  The most usual 
sort of self catering holiday is in a  
caravan, a flat or a cottage. A hotel  
is only a second choice.               
The family will often discuss the needs
within the area, particularly for      
recreation. Other complaints are the   
amount of new building taking place,   
the volume of traffic on the road, and 
the problem of increasing unemployment.</content>
