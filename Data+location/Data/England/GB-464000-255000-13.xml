		<title>13Bugbrooke Surgery</title>
		<content>In Bugbrooke there are three doctors:  
Dr.D.L.S.Paine,Dr.D.K.Dutta,Dr.A.Clark.
They have approximately 2000 patients  
each from an area larger than our grid.
There is one Health Visitor who is     
attached to the practice,and her job is
concerned with pre-school children and 
the elderly.                           
  There is one practice nurse who works
2 1/2  hours daily.There is also a     
chiropodist who works 1/2 day weekly.  
  This is a rural practice and is over 
a mile from the nearest chemist (in    
fact a lot more),so it also has a busy 
dispensary.                            
  The three practices are separate     
although they share a common building. 
  Most other health care is provided   
in  the nearby town of Northampton.    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
