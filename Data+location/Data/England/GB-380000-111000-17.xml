		<title>17ENTERTAINMENT SHILLINGSTONE</title>
		<content> Like many villages in the area,most of
 the entertainment in this part of the 
 Blackmore Vale is "homegrown".Several 
 occasions have now become             
 traditional.In Shillingstone the      
 annual concert produced by Myra       
 Whiting for the Scool Action Committee
 is always hilarious,and has grown from
 one night to three nights and a       
 matinee each year because of the      
 demand for tickets.The Annual Raft    
 Race organised by the Seymour Arms    
 attracts entries fromm a wide area of 
 Dorset. Rafts race down the Stour from
 Shillingstone to Blandford,a journey  
 which takes from 2 to 6 hours.The     
 Primary school holds an Annual        
 Country Dance party which includes    
 Maypole Dances. This is well supported
 by the village as well as parents,    
 relatives and former pupils.
