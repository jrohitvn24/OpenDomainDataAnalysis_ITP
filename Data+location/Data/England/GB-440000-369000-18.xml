		<title>18ROADS AND RAILS</title>
		<content> We did a traffic count on the three   
 main roads passing through the        
 village.The busiest road is the one   
 leading to the colliery where NCB     
 lorries are passing all day           
 long.People from the village complain 
 that dirt from the lorries spoils     
 their homes and their clean           
 washing.The main Chesterfield road    
 carries traffic to the area hospital  
 so we see a lot of ambulances.        
 RAILWAY /NATURE TRAIL                 
 There used to be a railway station in 
 Arkwright.Trains took coal to the     
 power station and passengers to the   
 east coast.Some people in the village 
 worked at the station.When the station
 was closed the land was made into a   
 nature trail.Everyone likes this idea.
 They often go for walks there.We let  
 our tadpoles go in the pond there.
