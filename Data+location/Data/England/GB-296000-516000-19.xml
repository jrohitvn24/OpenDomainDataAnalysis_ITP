		<title>19WHITEHAVEN HARBOUR &amp; DOCK.</title>
		<content> Whitehaven harbour &amp; dock were once   
 very busy but times have changed.     
 Almost all the original quays &amp;       
 piers remain as they were when John   
 Paul Jones made his famous attack on  
 the busy port in the 18th. century.At 
 that time rum,sugar and slaves were   
 the main imports.Most of the cargo    
 going out of the the harbour was      
 coal.The Heyday of coal in Whitehaven 
 was in 1927/28 when the total         
 broke 400,000 tons.The west pier was  
 completed in 1838 &amp; was designed by   
 John Rennie.The 'wet dock' is Queen's 
 Dock and is still used today.It can   
 accommodate ships up to 3000 gross    
 tons with a maximum length of 270feet 
 &amp; a draught of 18 feet.The main export
 is coal to Ireland &amp; Marchon Products 
 import phosphate rock from N.Africa.  
 "Clearway" is the last working coal   
 fired steam dredger in the country.   </content>
