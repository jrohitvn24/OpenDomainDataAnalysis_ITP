		<title>07A Day In My Life</title>
		<content>  I wake up at 7.45, get dressed and go
 downstairs.   I have breakfast        
 (normally cereal and orange juice).   
 Next I brush my teeth.   Then my mum  
 packs my lunch, while I watch T.V.    
 At 8.40 my mum takes me to school in  
 the car.   The 9.00 bell rings and we 
 all go to our classes.   After        
 registration we go into the hall for  
 assembly.   Afterwards we come back   
 and normally do maths till 10.35 which
 is breaktime.   We get our tuck and   
 play in the playground for 15 minutes.
   When we come in we do some English  
 work until lunchtime.   We have our   
 lunch then go over to the field.   We 
 play football.   At 1.10 we go back to
 our classes.   We get changed to play 
 rounders.   After an hour we come back
 and change.   For the last hour we do 
 project or enviromental work.   At    
 3.15 we go home.                      </content>
