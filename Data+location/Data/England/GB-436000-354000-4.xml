		<title>04SOUTH WINGFIELD _ HOUSING</title>
		<content> Most of the houses in our area are    
 concentrated in South Wingfield       
 Village.  Elsewhere the housing is    
 mainly scattered farms and individual 
 houses.  There are some old cottages  
 built of stone with stone roofs about 
 two hundred and fifty years old       
 although some of these have been      
 modernised and now have new slate or  
 tile roofs.  A large number of the    
 houses were built in late Victorian   
 times and the early twentieth         
 century.  These are often of red brick
 with slate roofs some were also built 
 as ribbon development in the inter_war
 period.  About thirty years ago a     
 small council development was built.  
 Since then some old peoples sheltered 
 housing has been constructed.  Eight  
 new houses are due for construction.  
 Most houses are owner occupied and    
 others rented from the council.       </content>
