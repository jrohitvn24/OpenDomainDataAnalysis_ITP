		<title>16MARKET HISTORY</title>
		<content> The market was started in 1286 by a   
 charter granted by Edward to the Monks
 of Burscough Priory. After the        
 dissolution of the monastries the     
 charter was granted to the Earl of    
 Derby and it was not until 1876 that  
 the people of the town bought the     
 rites to the market.                  
   It was an agricultural market where 
 livestock and produce were sold.      
 Traders came from the  surrounding    
 villages. Cattle and sheep were driven
 by a drover with the help of a little 
 black and tan dog, an Ormskirk Heeler.
 Butchers slaughtered animals in the   
 street.                               
   An American tourist in 1850 said"   
 The market is overcrowded dirty,      
 noisy and smelly but the people are   
 pleasant". Today, there are still     
 problems of litter and overcrowding   
 but the people are still pleasant.    </content>
