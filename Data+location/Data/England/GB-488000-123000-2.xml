		<title>02KING EDWARD VII HOSPITAL</title>
		<content> Situated in 152 acres of its own      
 grounds, King Edward VII Hospital was 
 founded by H.M. King Edward VII in    
 1902  to provide treatment for        
 "professional people of lesser means" 
 suffering from tuberculosis.  In the  
 1950's, when this need was diminished,
 facilities for general medical care   
 were developed and the hospital now   
 provides accommodation for 182 medical
 and surgical patients with four       
 operating theatres and 24-hour service
 of{pathology, radiograpy, pharmacy}and
{physiotherapy,}staffed by full-time   
 personnel.  Incorporated by Royal     
 Charter, it is the only hospital in   
 England of which HM Queen Elizabeth II
 is the President and all major        
 appointments must be approved by her. 
 It is a registered charity which has  
 allocated a proportion of its beds for
 National Health Service patients.     </content>
