		<title>03ELIZABETHAN GALLERY</title>
		<content> The Elizabethan Gallery is one of the 
 oldest buildings in Wakefield. It was 
 built in the last years of the reign  
 of Queen Elizabeth the First and was  
 the original Free Grammar School of   
 the City of Wakefield. The gallery is 
 situated between Wakefield market and 
 the central bus station facing on to  
 Brook Street. It is about ten minutes 
 walk from Wakefield Westgate station. 
 There is no parking for cars or       
 coaches by the gallery but the multi- 
 storey car park is only 100 yards     
 away. You can see exhibitions,        
 sculptures and paintings in the       
 gallery and it is open from 10.30 to  
 12.30 and 1.30 to 5.00p.m. Monday to  
 Saturday. Admission is free.
