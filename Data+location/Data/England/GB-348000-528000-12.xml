		<title>12Day in the life of Ian contd</title>
		<content> I play army, stick in the mud or      
 wally. At 1.25 I start lessons and    
 carry on working until I go home at   
 3.45.  When I get home I have a drink 
 and watch childrens television.  At   
 5.15 I have my tea, this is a time    
 when all my family are together and we
 chat about what happened through the  
 day.  After tea I watch the 5.45 news 
 to see whats happened around the      
 world, especialy for the sports       
 results.  When the news has finished I
 play outside with my friends, and then
 go to the cricket club with my dad to 
 practice at the nets.  We arrive home 
 about half past 8, I have a bath, get 
 ready for bed, then come down and     
 watch television until 9.30.  I go to 
 bed after an enjoyable day.           
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
