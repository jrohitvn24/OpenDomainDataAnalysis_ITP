 about 50 ha. in size.{                
     The majority of farmland is       
 pasture.Some of this is improved      
 grassland. Some farms specialise in   
 rearing pigs, others rear pigs and    
 beef cattle. Occasionally sheep are   
 bought in to be fattened.             
     Some farmers are owner occupiers  
 and others are tenants. See{Training  
{Areas}.
