		<title>14BASILDON NE: BEAT OFFICERS</title>
		<content> Basildon has 18 neighbourhood areas,  
 each patrolled by a male or female    
{Neighbourhood Beat Officer,}or{NBO.   
                                       
 NBOs usually patrol singly on foot,   
 but have the use of bicycles, cars or 
 vans if needed. They aim to get to    
 know those residing in their area,    
 and promote the image of the police by
 putting forward a fair and sensible   
 attitude. They try to make their area 
 a better place to live by getting the 
 public involved as a community.       
                                       
 Many NBOs visit primary schools to    
 give talks or films about road safety,
 the dangers of talking to strangers,  
 and safety in general. They have the  
 power to deal with children's         
 wrongdoings in a sympathetic manner.
