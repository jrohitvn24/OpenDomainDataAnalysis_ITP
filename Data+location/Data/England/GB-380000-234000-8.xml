		<content>   The  Upton  Deanery  held  a  Youth 
 Festival  in recognition of the{Inter 
{national Year for Youth.}It was organ-
 ised  by  the  vicar and local middle 
 school staff.                         
                                       
   For  four  hours  on  Sunday,  June 
 5th, 1985 about 450 people packed the 
 church and churchyard in Longdon to be
 entertained by the local  children who
 sang,  played and danced. A variety of
 craft  work  was on show including  an
 outstanding display of woodwork.      
                                       
   The vicar wrote:  "The whole of this
 programme  has  been an act of worship
 in  which  young  people  have made an
 offering to  God  in  thanksgiving for
 whatever  skill  or  ability they have
 been  able  to  develop.  We wish them
 well in the continuing developement of
 their talents".                       </content>
