		<title>17Introduction-Longnor Sports</title>
		<content>     Longnor Sports is an annual event 
held on a Thursday in September.  It is
a local tradition and has been going   
for 75 years.                          
                                       
     All the people in the area gather 
together and enjoy themselves.         
Everyone goes at some point in the day 
so it is very well known.  It starts   
at about 10 o'clock and finishes at    
about 4o'clock.                        
                                       
     The large tents are put up a day  
or two before the event.  One of the   
tents is for a bar.  There is a        
hot-dog stall and many firms have      
exhibitions of their farming           
equipment, such as mowers, bailers,    
and sheep pens, electric fences and    
sheep dips.  There are also stalls     
selling all kinds of equipment for     
horses.  Sometimes there is a fair.    </content>
