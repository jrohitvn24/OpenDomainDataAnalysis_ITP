		<content> In Tollesbury we have just had some   
 local council elections and for the   
 first time a{liberal/alliance         
 candidate was elected, Mr. John       
 Loxley.                               
 It has been exceptionally wet this    
 summer and recently we have had a     
 flood, some houses had up to 2 feet of
 water.                                
 In school several things have gone    
 missing, the video, four calculators  
 and over Â£5.00 have gone missing.     
 In the village there  have also been  
 some thefts in the last few days:_ 2  
 car radios, a set of golf clubs, a    
 B.M.W. car and Â£60.00 from a house in 
 East street.
