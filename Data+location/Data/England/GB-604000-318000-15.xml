		<title>15Property In Sparham</title>
		<content> Sparham lies off the A1067 Norwich to 
 Fakenham road. It has no modern       
 estates and is not likely to expand in
 the forseeable future as there are no 
 mains drains. There is a variety of   
 housing, both privately owned and     
 Council property, ranging in value    
 from Â£17000 to Â£67000. Most of the    
 houses are brick but there is some    
 carr stone as well. A Norfolk barn is 
 scheduled for conversion to a         
 dwelling. There is mains water &amp; elec-
 tricity but no North Sea gas, although
 some people use Calor gas. Oil or     
 solid fuel is used for central        
 heating; most houses have septic tanks
 but there is at least one house with  
 an outside water tap and a toilet for 
 which there is a night soil           
 collection. The village pump remains  
 as an emergency water supply.
