		<title>19The Survey And Work</title>
		<content>  The survey showed that most people   
 travel to work, out of 256 answers    
 9% work at home. Of the rest:-        
                                       
 Less than 2 miles............ 7%      
 2  miles to 10 miles.........28%      
 11 miles to 30 miles.........30%      
 31 miles to 50 miles.........22%      
 51 miles to 100 miles........13%      
                                       
    We tried not to include people who 
 travelled AS their work. We failed to 
 ask a question that would show how    
 many mothers or fathers stayed at home
 to care for families, and so felt we  
 had to exclude those few who actually 
 said they did, or put "Housewife".    
    A staggering 72% of firms were     
 LONDON based . In view of this it was 
 very surprising to learn that only 28%
 used public transport to go to work.
