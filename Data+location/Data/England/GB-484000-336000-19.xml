 Our project is very good,             
 There's lots of things to do,         
 There's chidren sewing tapestry,      
 And people writing too.               
                                       
 Harold was lying dead on the floor,   
 His enemy shouting more and more,     
 The arrows were flying thick and fast 
 Injuring people as they rode past.    
                                       
{1985 (by Helen Williams age 10yrs)    
 Computers, calculators and cars,      
 Satelites zooming off to Mars,        
 Telephone, telescope and television,  
 Battleships going off on a mission.   
                                       
 Space Invaders,cameras,and toasters,  
 And at the fair, Roller Coasters,     
 All these things that are very new,   
 Are certainly quite good for you!
