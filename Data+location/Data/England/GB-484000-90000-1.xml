		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO SOUTH SELSEY</title>
		<content>   {Selsey}once an island is now a     
 lively south coast peninsula village. 
 The 10% of our area which is land,we  
 shall call South Selsey is entirely   
 flat and is protected from the sea by 
 a recently completed{sea wall.}Only   
 part of the coast has a coastal path. 
  The{Lifeboat}and{fishing}play a major
 part in the life of the village.The   
 community works together to support   
 the Lifeboat and also the{elderly.}The
 houses in our area tend to be large,  
 older properties which are suitable   
 for conversion into{nursing}or{rest   
{homes.}The number of these is growing.
  The extra sunshine we get attracts   
 tourists here and many of these stay  
 at{Pontin's Broadreeds Holiday Camp.  
{Ornithologists}come to{Selsey Bill}all
 round the year.
