		<content>{Bogie}:one person stands in the middle
 of the playground and counts to a     
 hundred while everybody else runs away
 to hide.When she opens her eyes again 
 she tries to find the other people.If 
 the people get into the middle of the 
 playground without being touched they 
 shout bogie!If everybody gets in the  
 middle and shouts bogie the person in 
 the middle is on it again.            
{Non-stop-cricket}:You have two teams, 
 one team fields and one team bats.It  
 is fairer if the teacher bowls.The    
 fielding team has to try and catch the
 other team out,or they are out if the 
 bat or the ball touches the wicket.   
{Rounders}:Again you have two teams,   
 batters and fielders.There are four   
 posts forming a circle and one person 
 bowls and the batters have to try and 
 hit it with a wooden bat.If the ball  
 is caught whoever hit it is out.      </content>
