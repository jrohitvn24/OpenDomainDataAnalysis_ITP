		<content>  The coast between Weymouth and       
 Bowleaze Cove is subject to attack by 
 the sea.Every winter the beach road is
 closed when the high tides push tons  
 of shingle over the wall and onto the 
 road.                                 
  At Overcombe the cliff is slowly     
 falling into the sea. The end cottage 
 in the old coastguard building has    
 been damaged by this erosion. When    
 Portland Breakwater was being built   
 shiploads of stone were also dropped  
 at the base of the cliffs here. Those 
 same stones now form the reef just off
 the beach.                            
  Recently a new sea wall was built.The
 foundations were built very deep and a
 curve was added at the top. This makes
 the waves turn a somersault and return
 out to sea. The cliff was also faced  
 with stone to try to hold it up.
