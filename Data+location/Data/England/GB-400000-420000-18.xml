		<content>{New Landmark}A company operating a {  
{Radio-Phone Network}wants to erect a  
{100'Transmitter Mast}on the top of {  
{Crow Hill}one of the highest spots in 
 the area.The planning application is  
 for a directional antennae radio base 
 station surrounded by a security      
 fence.Planning application refused.   
{Water Bore Holes.}The increase in     
 population and mdern requirements have
 exceeded the traditional {Spring Water
  suppies.For this area five private   
 bore holes have been sunk to obtain   
 greater consistency and quality.{     
{Surface Water}varies seasonably and is
 affected by bacterial and chemical    
 pollutants.{Water Table Water}produces
 a constant supply from saturated      
 ground about 100' deep and is purer   
 because it has percolated through the 
 ground.
