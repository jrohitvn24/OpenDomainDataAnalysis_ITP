		<content> We have last play at 2.15. It finishes
 at at 2.30 and we go to the top       
 classroom and have a story. At 2.50 we
 put our chairs up on our tables and   
 say a going home prayer. School       
 finishes at three o' clock and my     
 Mummy takes me back home.             
 When I get home I unpack my things and
 go upstairs to get changed. When I    
 come downstairs I have a drink and a  
 biscuit. I play with my toys for a    
 while. I watch TV at a quarter past   
 four and at five o' clock I have my   
 tea. After tea I watch TV for a while 
 then I have to go upstairs and read my
 brother a story. I have a shower and  
 go downstairs. I have a cup of tea and
 read a book.                          
 At a quarter to eight I brush my teeth
 and go to bed. When I get to bed I    
 read for a while and then go to sleep.
