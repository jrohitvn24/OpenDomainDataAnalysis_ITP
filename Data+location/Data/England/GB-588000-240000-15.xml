		<title>15Population Cornards Growth</title>
		<content> After the war Cornard was chosen for  
development.This involved people moving
in from London to Cornard.They came to 
Cornard because they couldn't afford a 
house in London and Cornard was a much 
nicer place.Cornard and Haverhill grew 
when the Londoners came.Some houses for
the newcomers were private built by    
Janes in 1958 and the GLC built the St.
Andrews Road estate in 1966.When the   
newcomers came work had to be provided.
So a larger CAV and factories at       
Chilton were built.For entertainment   
there was the community centre and     
shops on Popular Road.Despite all these
factories many were still unemployed.  
30% went back to London as they found  
Cornard too quiet and wanted more livly
environment.400 new houses are being   
built on the Sycamore estate.
