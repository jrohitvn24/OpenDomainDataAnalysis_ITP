 SCHOOLS, ST.BIRINUS' AND DICOT        
 GIRLS',AND 5 PRIMARY SCHOOLS.         
 A TEACHER WHO HAS BEEN HERE FOR OVER  
 20 YEARS SAID THAT WHEN SHE STARTED   
 WORK,PUPILS BEHAVED BETTER BECAUSE    
 THEY RESPECTED THEIR ELDERS; WHEN     
 STAFF CAME INTO THEIR LESSONS THERE   
 WAS ABSOLUTE SILENCE.20 YEARS         
 AGO,MISS. LARDNER WAS                 
 HEADMISTRESS.PUPILS COULD TAKE 9      
 EXAM.SUBJECTS.THE BUILDING WAS        
 DIFFERENT AND THE UNIFORM WAS GREEN   
 AND WHITE FOR THE SECONDARY MODERN    
 SCHOOL AND BLUE AND WHITE FOR THE     
 GRAMMAR SCHOOL.THERE WERE 8 LESSONS   
 WITH BREAKS BOTH IN THE MORNING AND   
 AFTERNOON.EVERYONE HAD TO LINE UP IN  
 SILENCE IN THE FRONT YARD BEFORE THEY 
 WERE ALLOWED IN.EACH LESSON LASTED 30 
 MINUTES.MOST OF THE RULES WERE THE    
 SAME AS NOW -E.G. NO JEWELLERY-CONT   </content>
