		<title>16My Hobby in Woodlesford</title>
		<content> My hobby is going horse riding.I go   
 every Saturday and I really enjoy it. 
 I ride on a horse called Skippy,she is
 a chestnut coloured horse and she has 
 lovely sad brown eyes.I go to Royds   
 Hall J &amp; C Riding School.My friend    
 Deborah rides a horse called Adam who 
 is a lovely brown horse.We sometimes  
 have jumps put out for us.We trot     
 around the field doing rise and trot  
 and sitting trot.Then she would ask us
 to canter around the field one by one.
 We finish our lesson at 1-0-clock,I   
 lead Skippy into her stable and I take
 her bridle off,I then give her a polo 
 and a big pat.I have ridden on a big  
 horse called Shannon.
