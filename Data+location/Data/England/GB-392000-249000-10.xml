		<title>10Old wives tales</title>
		<content> From the older people of the area we  
 have come across many old wives tales,
 some of them well known, others more  
 obscure.                              
    People believe that if you break a 
 mirror you will have seven years of   
 bad luck. It is also bad luck to put  
 new shoes on the table, not to mention
 it being rather unhygenic too! Ill    
 fortune will ensue also if you look   
 through the window at a new moon.     
    On the other hand, if you turn a   
 coin in your pocket, you will be      
 blessed with good fortune.            
    These beliefs are aptly named "old 
 wives tales" because it is mainly the 
 older generation who take any heed of 
 them. Children are much more cynical  
 these days, and tend to dismiss such  
 ideas as rubbish.
