		<title>10ILLNESS IN NASSINGTON.</title>
		<content>After our survey of parents and        
children of Nassington school in the   
past year we found that many people    
had had influenza.They stayed in bed   
and took pills like Disprin or         
Paracetamol.Others had tonsilitis and  
took antibiotics.A number seem to have 
problems with their bones-hip pain,    
slipped discs,knee cartilage trouble   
and a few bad back aches.Their         
treatment was to have surgery or be    
careful and stay in bed.The commonest  
illness is really the common cold      
which  everyone  seems to get at least 
once a year.At school we have had      
people away with tummy bugs,sickness,  
mumps and chicken pox.Many people have 
hayfever at present.Illnesses lasted   
for periods of between one week for    
things like flu and a whole year for   
back pain.Most people go to KingsCliffe
surgery then Wansford or Oundle.       </content>
