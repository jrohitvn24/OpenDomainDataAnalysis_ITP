		<title>04Marton Residents,Interview</title>
		<content> On Tuesday we interviewed a lady.The  
 lady doesn't like the village as much 
 now as she did when she was a         
 child.She used to go to the village   
 school and all her three children went
 there.It closed down 12 years ago.She 
 hasn't a car but her husband has      
 one.She uses the bus a lot.When the   
 railway was in use she found that a   
 great help.Some of the houses have    
 been modernised and she has watched   
 Marton grow.Two of her children live  
 in Marton still.She thinks that the   
 village is not a proper community now 
 because of the new people.Most of her 
 friends live in the village.As a child
 she could relate the names of all the 
 villagers but now she couldn't name   
 above half the residents.             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
