 A flint wall 6'6" high at present     
 being repaired, encloses the park,    
 interspersed with several entrance    
 gates and lodges. One or two lodges   
 have been demolished through lack of  
 use and amenities. Those that remain  
 have been modernised. They are built  
 of flint in the style of miniature    
 castles with turrets and castellated  
 walls. The gates are painted in deep  
 red known as Arundel red. Several     
 lodges are inhabited by workers on the
 Norfolk Estate. High up in the park   
 stands the Hiorne Tower, a shooting   
 lodge built by an architect to show   
 his skill when he hoped to be employed
 to restore Arundel Castle in the      
 late 19th century.
