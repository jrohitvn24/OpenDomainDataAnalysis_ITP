 Tilstock Parish Council is part of    
 Whitchurch Rural Council and is one of
 two wards the other being Ash. Five   
 members are elected from each ward.The
 present Chairman is Mr.Lewis and the  
 Vice Chairman is Mr.Dorey.The aim of  
 the council is to promote the well    
 being of the area,supporting plans and
 schemes which are to the benefit of   
 allthe inhabitants.Of particular      
 concern at present is the traffic     
 passing through the village,which     
 being unrestricted is particulary     
 dangerous to children and older       
 residents.(See separate report under  
 Events.)
