    Shores Hey, which is an extension  
 of another local HAPPA home, is now a 
 haven for neglected and maltreated    
 horses and ponies. Among them are     
 SUGAR and SPICE who were kept in a    
 constantly flooded paddock; SILVER    
 whose owners were prosecuted for      
 neglecting his feet; SUNNY who came to
 HAPPA when he was 15; DUNCAN the      
 shetland escapologist; several lively 
 youngsters (to be broken for riding if
 possible) and several old horses who  
 are here to live out their days in    
 peace.                                
                                       
    Dealing with all these characters  
 takes a lot of love, patience and     
 dedication.
