		<title>11THE STATE CINEMA, GRAYS</title>
		<content>  The State Cinema was built in George 
 Street in 1938. Through the years many
 people have enjoyed films that have   
 been shown. In February 1985 a        
 conservation order was put on the     
 building after an application had been
 made to demolish the cinema for a     
 development scheme.                   
  The cinema is rated as being the most
 complete and unaltered building of its
 type in Britain. The State also has   
 one of the few remaining{COMPTON      
{THEATRE ORGANS}in the country.        
  The B.B.C. used the cinema in June   
 1985 to record sequences for a        
 programme about the{BLUEBELL DANCING  
{GIRLS.}                               
  Local people are supporting a        
 campaign to keep the State open and   
 prevent the closure of the only       
 remaining cinema in Grays.
