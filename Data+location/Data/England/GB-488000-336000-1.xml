		<title>01The Great Gonerby Area</title>
		<content> Great Gonerby is recorded in the      
 original Domesday Survey. It looks    
 over the Vale of Belvoir and stands on
 the summit of a hill on the old Great 
 North Road.  The village is now       
 bypassed by the A1 trunk road There   
 are four large farms the majority of  
 residents work in nearby Grantham, or 
 commute to Notthingham or London.     
 Gonerby Hill Foot is mainly           
 residential, apart from a food        
 processing factory and Cash and Carry 
 food sales warehouse.                 
 Barrowby stands on rising ground      
 betwen Grantha and the Lincolnshire   
 Notthinghamshire boundary.  The parish
 is bounded by the A52 road to the     
 north and the A1 to the east giving   
 good transport links to the whole     
 Midland area.
