		<title>06Turf Research for Sport</title>
		<content> The Sports Turf Research Institute was
 founded in 1929. Their main functions 
 were for research and advice to golf  
 clubs about the construction and      
 maintainance of golf courses.         
 They grow various types of grass for  
 research purposes to find out the best
 possible turf to use on all types of  
 sports fields. Trials are done on     
 small areas of turf called            
 cultivated varieties. One of their    
 jobs was to find suitable turf for    
 Wembley Football Stadium.             
 A great deal of their work in science 
 and technology is done for St.        
 Andrew's Golf Club. However many local
 sporting clubs, including football,   
 horse racing and bowling pay a fee to 
 become members and they receive       
 advice on their turf.
