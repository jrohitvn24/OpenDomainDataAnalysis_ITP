		<content> Binsdale Farm is the only farm in our 
 area which has fruit and vegetables   
 for customers to pick themselves. It  
 has a fruit field. There are five     
 acres of strawberries. The two kinds  
 are Tamellos and Cambridge Favourites.
 The strawberry plants last for four   
 years before replanting.There are 4   
 acres of land planted with cabbages,  
 cauliflowers, potatoes, beetroot and  
 calabrese. The farmer has a little    
 ice cream trolley to sell ices to     
 customers. He has a little caravan    
 where he weighs the produce. The      
 family takes it in turn to serve      
 customers. Selling starts in July each
 year. Sometimes the farmer takes water
 from the Gypsey Race to water his     
 vegetables.
