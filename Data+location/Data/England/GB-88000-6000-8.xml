		<content> I got up at 7.30am in the mo rning.I  
 dressed then went downstairs and had a
 breakfast of Weetabix.After breakfast 
 I had to feed my guinea pigs ,comb my 
 hair ,make my bed ,wash and clean my  
 teeth and get the milk can for our    
 visitors and then take it back full of
 milk. Mr Andrew Davis,the Vanguard    
 boatman took us acoss.As mother had   
 the pushchair I held Julian for her   
 while she folded it.When we  were     
 going out of the shop my dad came and 
 picked us up in his boat,The Vasna.At 
 St Agnes I went down to my friend     
 Sara's house for tea.After tea Sara's 
 brother Lyndon joined in and played   
 Blind Man's Buff with us.At 8.30pm I  
 went home and to bed.
