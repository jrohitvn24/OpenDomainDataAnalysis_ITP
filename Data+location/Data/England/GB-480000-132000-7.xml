		<title>07The Bakery, Conford.</title>
		<content> Approaching Conford one sees a single 
 storey brick building with no windows 
 and a collection of tiled roofs. The  
 baker and his partner have seen the   
 demise of all small bakeries around   
 but continue to provide bread for     
 discerning people in local villages   
 from these premises.                  
 One's glance through the doorway round
 the back focuses on two large iron    
 doors of the double stack and probably
 original ovens, now heated            
 independently by oil firing.A large   
 mixer kneader is nearby but there is  
 hand kneading of the dough for        
 loaves, rolls, currant breads, dough  
 cakes and croissants.Wholemeal and rye
 bread is also made. The baker delivers
 to some of the local shops, but orders
 by individuals can be collected from  
 the bakery. The trend to more roughage
 by eating wholemeal bread was noted.  </content>
