		<content> Villages of Elsworth and Papworth     
 Everard in the County of              
 Cambridgeshire.                       
                                       
 This is primarily a rural area but for
 different reasons the villages are not
 greatly affected.                     
{Elsworth,}with a population of 650, is
 a beautiful village with many old     
 houses, some dating from Tudor times. 
 It is essentially a commuter village. 
 It has a varied and interesting       
 natural history.                      
{Papworth Everard}takes most of its    
 features from the Papworth Village    
 Settlement, which was set up to care  
 for tuberculosis patients in 1918.    
 Papworth also has international       
 recognition for its hospital, which   
 specialises in cardiac cases, and is  
 one of the world's leading heart      
 transplant hospitals.                 </content>
