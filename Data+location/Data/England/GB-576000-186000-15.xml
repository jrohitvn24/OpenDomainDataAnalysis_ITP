		<content> Numerous small private nursery schools
 cater for the pre_school child.From 5 
 to 11 children attend Primary Schools,
 maintained by the Essex C.C:South     
 Benfleet,Jotmans and Kents            
 Hill,or the Roman Catholic Primary    
 School,The Holy Family.At eleven the  
 children transfer to either the King  
 John School or Appleton School,which  
 are both Comprehensive Schools for    
 boys and girls.A very small percentage
 of pupils sit a special examination   
 called the 11+ which might enable them
 to attend a Grammar School in the     
 neighbouring borough of Southend.     
 Pupils who opt for further education  
 attend the South East Essex Sixth Form
 College in Thundersley,or the Southend
 and Basildon Technical Colleges
