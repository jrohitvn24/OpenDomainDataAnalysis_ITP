		<title>05**   DEPUTY LORD MAYOR    **</title>
		<content> The Lord Mayor could have engagements 
 in Leeds, Morley, Pudsey, Weatherby or
 Crossgates. Other questions were:-    
 "Do you find it difficult to run a    
 shop with all your engagements and do 
 you own any other shops in Leeds?"    
 Councillor Hyde said it was very      
 difficult at times and they depend on 
 other people to help out. That was why
 Mrs. Hydes mother and father are seen 
 in the shop quite a bit as they run it
 when Mr. and Mrs. Hyde cannot be      
 there. They used to have a shop on    
 York Road at Seacroft which was sold  
 three years ago. Concillor Hyde said  
 that it was just a little difficult   
 because the people helping in that    
 shop wished to do less work because   
 they were past their time. They now   
 only have one shop.
