 In the holidays I am usually up at 8am
 - the dog jumps on my bed. While I am 
eating my cornflakes for breakfast,I   
watch "T.V.am".After clearing up,I put 
on my tennis clothes and cycle to meet 
my friend.I pass the church,farm and   
school.At 1pm we go for lunch,my house 
is on the edge of Lympstone as it is   
new.Lunch is a snack meal as Mum often 
goes shopping in Exmouth.In the after- 
noon my friend and I may go to the     
shore or to my Gran's across the fields
for tea.On the way home we often meet  
people we know as Lympstone is a very  
friendly place.In the evening I may    
help Mum with the dishes or ironing.We 
sometimes eat our meal watching the    
T.V.Mum and Dad eat at 8pm.We go to bed
by 9.30.
