		<content>  T he largest store in the block is   
 Barretts of Feckenham. It is situated 
 just outside the village of Feckenham.
                                       
   It began as a Saddlers shop in      
 approximately 1830, and has operated  
 as a retail business in the same      
 location ever since. In recent years  
 it has expanded considerably and is   
 now one of Britains leading leisure   
 groups within its own range of        
 merchandise.                          
                                       
   In the 1960's the old double fronted
 cottages were demolished and the      
 present building was erected. The     
 anoraks and casual clothing lines were
 developed and added to the already    
 established lines of saddlery and     
 sheepskin clothing. The camping and   
 outdoor leisure furniture sections    
 also expanded at this time.           </content>
