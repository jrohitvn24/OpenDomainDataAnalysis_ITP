    The residential area around the    
 school consists of many detached      
 houses. They are occupied by old      
 people, mostly. Most of the houses are
 in a poor state with chipped paint    
 and deteriorating structures. There   
 are few houses which are modern.      
 Houses in general on Shoreham Beach   
 are expensive because they are        
 detached and quite big.               
    On doing a survey with the         
 residents around the school, it was   
 discovered that the school was popular
 and nobody has bad feelings about it. 
 Many people are in favour of doing    
 fund raising for it and liked the     
 thought of having a social evening    
 once or twice a week for the young and
 old there.
