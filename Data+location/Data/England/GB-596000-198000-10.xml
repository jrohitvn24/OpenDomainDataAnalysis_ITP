		<content> The Great Eastern Railway was formed  
 in 1862 and in the Eastern Counties it
 developed fast lines to all the major 
 towns of the area.                    
 In 1883 the Railway was empowered to  
 build a branch line from Wickford to  
 Southminster.The Southminster line was
 finished,opening for goods services in
 June 1889 and for passenger service in
 July 1889 with a limited Sunday       
 service.                              
 Steam ended and services by diesel    
 commenced in June 1956.In 1956 it was 
 feared the line would be closed,and   
 goods trafic ceased.                  
 In 1969 Sunday passenger services     
 ended but were resumed in 1980 from   
 late June until September.            
 Work has now started on the           
 electrification of the line from      
 Wickford to Southminster.
