		<title>04INTERVIEW - BROWN FARM</title>
		<content>  The nearest shop is two miles away in
 Huish Champflower and the nearest     
 shopping centre of any size is        
 Wiveliscombe over seven miles away.   
 Even this is only a small town and for
 larger purchases the residents must   
 go to Wellington or Taunton. It is    
 therefore necessary to own a car if   
 you live in this area.                
 The nearest post box is one a mile    
 away at Sperry Cross but the postman  
 calls at the farm each day. The       
 fishmonger calls once a fortnight and 
 the baker once a week.                
 The nearest schools are in            
 Wiveliscombe, both primary and        
 comprehensive. Brown farms are at the 
 end of the catchment area and the     
 children travel to and from school by 
 minibus. There are vets and doctors in
 Wiveliscombe and a blacksmith at      
 Dulverton.                            </content>
