		<content>   The western part of Souldern is in  
this area. It is a small village with a
{GARAGE} that sells petrol and repairs 
cars and a general store/Post Office.  
   The {HOUSES} are mainly of stone and
terraced though there are some large   
detached houses including the Manor.   
   The {AGRICULTURE} is mainly cereal  
with a small number of grass fields    
near the river.                        
   Also in this area are 22            
{ALLOTMENTS} which are used by         
villagers to grow vegetables.          
   One feature of the village is the   
old {MILL} by the side of which is a   
ford which is where cars drive through 
the stream.                            
The {OXFORD CANAL} and 2 {RAILWAY      
LINES} pass through; 1 to Oxford and   
the other crosses 2 viaducts on its    
way to High Wycombe and London         
(Marylebone)                           </content>
