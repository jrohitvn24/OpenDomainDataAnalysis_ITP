		<content> Outside there is a large car park and 
 a beer garden where families are      
 welcome.  This is frequented by the   
 Inn's 3 ducks and 2 drakes which live 
 in the field next door.  There are 5  
 1/2 acres of land attached to the Inn 
 and this is sub-let for grazing sheep.
  Also every September a{Folk Festival}
 is held here.                         
 The{customers}to the Inn are mainly   
 middle-aged as there is no fruit      
 machine or juke box.  Many are farmers
 or passing visitors to the area.      
 There is no walk-in trade.  The pub   
 relies heavily on Summer trade.       
 The Inn has a{Tug of War team}        
 which competes in the Derby Winter    
 League.                               
 The building is part centrally-heated 
 and there is a real fire in the bar   
 lounge using coal, anthracite and     
 logs.                                 </content>
