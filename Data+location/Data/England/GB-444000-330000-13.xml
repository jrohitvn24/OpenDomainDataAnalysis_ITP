		<content> Fishing is the most popular           
 participant sport in the U.K.   There 
 is a waiting list of 2 to 3 years in  
 this area to become a member of a club
 in order to obtain a fishing licence. 
 During the past 10 to 15 years there  
 has been an improvement in the level  
 of pollution in the Rivers Trent and  
 Derwent.   100 years ago salmon was   
 found in the rivers at Shardlow.      
 More fish are now able to live in the 
 waters and fishermen find Roach, Bream
 Barbel, Perch and Gudgeon.   By the   
 end of 1986 the use of lead           
 weights will be illegal.   99% of the 
 fishermen use lead weights in spite of
 the death of  many swans from lead    
 poisoning,although more fishermen are 
 being more careful about leaving nylon
 thread and lead weights on the bank   
 side.                                 
                                       </content>
