		<content>      {THE MINING STRIKE 1984          
{ }The miners strike started on the    
 12th of March 1984 and finished about 
 the same time a year later. My family 
 were only getting Â£35 per week. My    
 sister,who had left school,was getting
 Â£25. She gave Â£10 to my Mum and kept  
 the rest for herself.                 
  I was getting free dinners at school 
 and I was getting them through the    
 holidays as well.                     
   I don't think we could have coped if
 my nannas and aunties were not helping
 us. My dad was also getting a food    
 parcel every week.                    
   For the working pickets there was a 
 soup kitchen where they could get     
 breakfast,dinner and tea. With this   
 strike it was hard because our family 
 hardly got any money to buy food. My  
 dad found out that people at Hatfield 
 were giving out food parcels.         </content>
