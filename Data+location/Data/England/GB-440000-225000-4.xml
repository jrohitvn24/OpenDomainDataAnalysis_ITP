		<content>Middle Barton is a village between the 
hamlets of Steeple Barton and Westcote 
Barton. It began to develop in 1350    
when the thriving community at Steeple 
Barton came to an end because of the   
Black Death. Middle Barton became an   
'open' village with many small holders.
The building of Heyford Bridge made    
the east-west road important because   
people could travel out of the village.
In the 1860's and 1870's,Middle Barton 
took its present shape with people     
acting as squatters and building their 
cottages on the roadside waste.
