		<content>  One of the most popular hobbies in   
 Guildford is collecting and there are 
 some unusual collecting habits. One of
 these is collecting "White Elephants".
 Others collect medals, jugs and even  
 photographs. There are many antique or
 collectors' shops in the area.        
  Other common hobbies include golf,   
 photography, reading, gardening and   
 fishing at local ponds. One fishing   
 area is the Broadwater Lake near      
 Godalming.                            
  Horse riding is another much-loved   
 hobby and many Guildfordians spend    
 their free time in this way. There are
 a few riding schools in the area but  
 not in the town. There are many       
 opportunities to learn music either in
 instrumental lessons or by playing or 
 singing in an orchestra or choir.
