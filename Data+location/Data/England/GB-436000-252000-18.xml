 In houses things are changing such as 
 the oven.The oven is being replaced by
 the MICROWAVE OVEN.The Microwave is an
 electric box with lots of buttons.The 
 Microwave cooks food much faster than 
 the oven.It has a glass door and in_  
 side it has a special Microwave oven  
 plate.You can even warm your cup of   
 tea in the Microwave.                 
  TELEVISIONS are getting different    
 channels.We have now got BBC1,BBC2,ITV
 and CHANNEL 4.The tv adverts are also 
 changing.In the house another thing   
 that is changing are the FRIDGES and  
 FREEZERS.Fridges and freezers are     
 gradually getting smaller and becoming
 fridge_freezers.                      
  COMPUTERS are also getting smaller   
 they have came from filling up a whole
 room to a size where you can wear them
 on your wrist.                        </content>
