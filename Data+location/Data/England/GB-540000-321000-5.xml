		<content>   "I think it is very sad that it has 
 taken so long for the Long Sutton     
 by-pass to be built and I think the   
 people have every right to feel we    
 have been 'leap-frogged' both by      
 Terrington St. Clements and Crowland. 
 I think our town needed a by-pass just
 as much, if not more, and I think it  
 is caused one or two of the problems  
 that had the by-pass been here they   
 would have been avoided. Already such 
 things as the depot, which is giving  
 concern in Swapcoat Lane and now      
 problems for the proposed new primary 
 school, would have probably been sited
 near the by-pass  which  would have   
 been better for everybody. I think the
 whole planning for the district is    
 centered round when and where the     
 by-pass will be."
