		<content> This rural area on the northern fringe
 of Dartmoor lies mainly within the 2  
 parishes of Cheriton Bishop and       
 Hittisleigh. It is bisected from SW to
 NE by a steep-sided wooded valley     
 through which flows the river Yeo. The
 roads are narrow lanes bordered by    
 banks and hedges with field gateways  
 providing passing places for traffic. 
 All mains electricity and telephones  
 are supplied by overhead cables       
 supported on wooden poles. There is   
 one small centre of population at the 
 hamlet of Hittisleigh which has the   
 only street lighting in the area. The 
 rest of the population is very        
 scattered. The total number of        
 buildings is 1 church, 1 chapel, 18   
 farms with buildings, 2 derelict      
 farmhouses, 48 other properties, 1 car
 scrapyard and a building material     
 depot.                                </content>
