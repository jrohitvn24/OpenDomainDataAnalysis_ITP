		<title>09Green Street Mosque, Bristol</title>
		<content> Every day I go to the mosque in       
 Bristol, except on Sundays.  There are
 always over 50 children there.  The   
 mosque session ends at 5.30 p.m. for  
 girls.  In the mosque, we read the    
 Koran and some girls, including       
 myself, learn to read and write Urdu. 
 Many people in my school respect the  
 mosque.  When you go into the mosque, 
 you must not show your legs and you   
 have to wear a dupata on your head.   
 Boys wear a hat on their heads, but   
 for smaller children, it is not       
 necessary to wear anything on their   
 heads.  Before reading the Koran, you 
 must do your wazu which is a special  
 wash.                                 
 Many English people come to visit the 
 mosque, especially on special         
 occasions such as Eid, Pakistan Day   
 etc. Also people come to take         
 photographs for their projects.       </content>
