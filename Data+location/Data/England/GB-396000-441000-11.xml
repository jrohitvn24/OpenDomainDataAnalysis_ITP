		<title>11INDUSTRY PIG FARMING</title>
		<content>{WESTAWAYS} have been in business for  
 eight years.They breed pigs for the   
 market and also for freezing.They send
 about 40 pigs each week to the        
 slaughter house when they are around  
 140 pounds weight.They will have been 
 at the pig farm between 17 -18 weeks, 
 and will have been born at the farm.  
 The farm usually has 90 sows and 5    
 boars.The new boar is called Amos.When
 the piglets are new-born they have to 
 have their teeth clipped so that they 
 are not too sharp for the sows teat   
 when they are feeding.If there are any
 weak piglets they are put into a      
 weaning shed.If one sow has only 4 or 
 5 piglets and another sow has 14 or   
 15,they share the piglets between     
 them.Westaways also have a shop where 
 they sell their own pork,and other    
 frozen food.Four people work there.   
 The farm is just outside the village. </content>
