		<title>09The Sewage Works</title>
		<content> The sewage works was built in 1940. In
 1983 it was modernized. My Dad works  
 for Anglian Water. The difference     
 between Anglian Water and Anglian     
 Water Authority is that Anglian Water 
 works with sewage and Anglian Water   
 Authority works with clean water.     
    The sewage works has five sludge   
 tanks,a lake and a bridge. There is an
 electronic control panel which        
 monitors the complete operation.      
    The lake is for aeration. The water
 comes through three pipes. Then it    
 goes through two revolving blades.    
 Then it goes into the well where the  
 bridge revolves.The fat is then       
 washed into the sludge tanks.The fat  
 is the thick black substance on top   
 of the water. It then goes to Brigg   
 where it goes through a more          
 complicated device which continues the
 process of purification.              </content>
