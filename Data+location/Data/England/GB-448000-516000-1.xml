 The area on the south side of         
 Middlesbrough,at a distance of 2 to 3 
 miles from the city centre,is largely 
 given over to housing.There are also  
 many schools and recreation grounds.  
  The types of houses are varied :     
 generally speaking,at this distance   
 from the town centre they are fairly  
 spaciously laid out;many have         
 attractive gardens,some containing    
 mature trees.The houses were built at 
 different times over the last 100     
 years: there are a few cottages,some  
 Victorian suburban villas,streets     
 dating from the 20's,30's,50's _ and  
 some new houses being built today.    
  The primary schools generally stand  
 alone,but the secondary schools are   
 often grouped in twos or threes on    
 campuses on the southern edge of the  
 area, e.g. the schools on Acklam Base.</content>
