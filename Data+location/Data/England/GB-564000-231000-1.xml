		<content> A small rural area devoted to farming 
 set deep in the heart of the Essex    
 countryside. Low rainfall making the  
 area suitable for the growing of      
 cereals. No village. Scattered        
 cottages and houses only. Major       
 buildings,an Anglican church and      
 Spains Hall,an Elizabethan manor      
 house. Fine old period farmhouses     
 Limited amenities for health services,
 recreation,banking,shopping,schools   
 and theatres. People go to            
 neighbouring villages and towns. Small
 population approx.250. Mainly people  
 born or working in the area. Small    
 commuter element. Few retired. Small  
 number of 'weekenders'. The area is   
 basically arable fields,bounded by    
 hedges,copses and a great abundance of
 wild flowers in spring and summer     
 months enhancing the beautiful        
 landscape of the whole area.          </content>
