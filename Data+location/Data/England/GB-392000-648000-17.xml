		<title>17Salmon Fishing Continued</title>
		<content>  Many of tyhe fisheries have now      
 closed for various reasons, poaching  
 both on the river and at sea have     
 meant a reduction in the number of    
 fish to be caught. The Tweed          
 Commisioners,a body set up under The  
 Tweed Act are responsible for trying  
 to ensure the wellbeing of the river  
 as a successful salmon fishing river  
 and employ bailiffs to carry out the  
 task of preventing poaching.          
    The season starts on February 14th 
 at midnight and ends at midight on    
 September 14th the close season allows
 fish to travel upriver to the spawning
 beds.On the lower reaches the fishing 
 is tidal but higher upriver most      
 fishing is carried out in the hours of
 darkness except during floods when the
 water is coloured and they can work in
 daylight hours.Salmon,sea-trout and   
 grilse are the fish netted.           </content>
