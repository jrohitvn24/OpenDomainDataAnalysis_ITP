		<title>11ADLINGTON HALL ESTATE</title>
		<content> The estate contains about two thousand
 acres. Most of it is let to tenant    
 farmers for grazing of stock,         
 especially cows and sheep.            
    The grounds are used each week by  
 an archery club, and other societies  
 hold functions at the hall or in its  
 grounds. The North West Motor Show is 
 held here each year.                  
    The number of visitors to the hall 
 is declining. In 1978 eleven thousand 
 were recorded, but these have now     
 fallen to five thousand. Overseas     
 visitors also come. The stables were  
 converted two years ago and are used  
 for wedding parties and receptions.   
 There are no plans to develop the hall
 as a pleasure park as others have     
 done.                                 
   Handel, the famous composer stayed  
 at the hall and wrote music for a     
 hunting song during his visit.        </content>
