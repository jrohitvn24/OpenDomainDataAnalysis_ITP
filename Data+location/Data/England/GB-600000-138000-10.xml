		<content> Kingsnorth run a cricket club and     
 football in the winter. South Ashford 
 has a Youth Centre and a Youth Wing   
 attached to a Secondary School.       
 Football clubs operate for adults and 
 youngsters. Whilst the Stour Centre is
 not based in our 'block', many        
 children and adults attend for a      
 multiplicity of indoor sports _       
 squash, badminton, soccer, volleyball,
 weight lifting, etc. A swimming pool  
 is the main attraction. During School 
 holidays arrangements are made to     
 enable youngsters to experience the   
 whole range. Local firms operate      
 midday leagues and encourage employees
 to participate. A Cactus Society and  
 two Gardening groups operate. Fishing 
 takes place in local streams and      
 ponds.
