 of the farms are Finlow Hill Farm,    
 Fittontown Farm and Higher House Farm.
 At Hocker Lane Farm they grow Cheshire
 potatoes. At Fittontown Farm they grow
 potatoes,swedes,corn and hay. New     
 House Farm has 3 acres but is not used
 as a farm any more.                   
 All these farms are situated in nice  
 positions in the countryside.Lots of  
 people come walking to the farms with 
 all the animals.
