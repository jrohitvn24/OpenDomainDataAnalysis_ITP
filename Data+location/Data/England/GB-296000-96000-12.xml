		<content> I'm doing a project on shops.Shops    
 started in Saxon times and they're    
 still here now.Some of our shops sell 
 groceries.Groceries are all different 
 kinds of fruit,veg,sugar,salt,pepper, 
 tinned things etc.Markets are like    
 outside shops.They sell the same kind 
 of stuff but they shout out what they 
 sell &amp; the item's price.              
  Here in Broadclyst we've got two     
 sweet shops and one garage that sells 
 sweets.Both of the other shops sell   
 bits &amp; bobs (food,drink,toys etc).    
  {GATEWAYS}is our big supermarket.It  
 sells everything down to clothes.It   
 sells toys,makeup,food,fruit,junkfood.
 Most prices have gone up (or so people
 say) so some people have stoped going.
 Lots of people just go to the local   
 shops because it saves time.Maybe they
 don't approve of big shops,but don't  
 worry {GATEWAYS}won't close down{.    </content>
