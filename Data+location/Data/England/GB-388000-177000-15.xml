		<title>15Interview With Mrs Bird</title>
		<content> Debbie and I went to interview my mum.
 She told us all about the village and 
 how it has changed over the years.    
 My mum came to{Stanton School}in 1949.
 She told us lots about the school.    
 Stanton School was only one class room
 in those days but they divided it into
 2 classes. The village had only 29    
 houses and hardly any cars came by so 
 they could play in the road. They did 
 not have{electric lights}or{flush     
{lavatories.}Mum's first teacher was   
 called Mrs Lucker and then Mrs Dyke.  
 Her best{subjects}were drawing and    
 writing essays. She liked school a bit
 but not a lot. They did not have the  
 school field then, they first had the 
 playground and it had gravel on it so 
 it would be very hard to fall on.
