		<content>  This survey was completed by 50      
people,telling us how they like to     
spend their free-time in Great         
Waldingfield.A lot of people spend     
their leisure time watching television.
  The average amount of time spent     
watching television was 18 hours,but   
this isn't including video recorded    
programmes. Only about 3 hours a week  
was spent watching video tapes or      
recorded programmes.Spectating and     
active sports both received 2-3 hours a
week.Keep-Fit and Jogging also received
2 hours a week.Some young people spend 
some of their free-time at             
Scouts/Guides/Youth Organisations about
1 hour a week.Other hobbies which      
people enjoy taking part in are        
fishing which was very popular,        
football,drawing,reading and           
computing.About 4 hours a week were    
spent in doing these activities.       </content>
