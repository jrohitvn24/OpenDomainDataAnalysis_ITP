		<title>01SUMMARY OF THE AREA.</title>
		<content>The area is situated between the       
estuaries of the River Orwell and Deben
{four miles East of Ipswich and two    
miles South of Woodbridge}.            
It is low, slightly undulating plateau 
of mainly sandy soil with patches of   
heavier soils particularly in two small
tributaries of the Deben.              
The area, comprising parts of the      
Parishes of Martlesham,                
Waldringfield, Brightwell and          
Newbourne, is mainly rural, divided    
into large arable and mixed farms,     
with smaller areas of heathland,       
woodland and marshes. The chief centre 
of the population is Martlesham New    
Village developed in the last twenty   
years. This is separated from a growing
industrial estate on the west by the   
recent eastern section of the Ipswich  
Southern By-pass  which joins the A12  
at Martlesham.                         </content>
