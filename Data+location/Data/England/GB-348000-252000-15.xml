		<title>15A Tale of Two Pubs</title>
		<content>{(1)}An{Ordnance Survey map}dated{1886 
 shows a public house called{The Royal 
{Oak.}The building stands beside the   
 main road close by the school.It was  
 owned by{Hampton Court Estate.}Local  
 residents,travellers,farm &amp; estate    
 workers used it.In the{1920's}the pub 
 was{shut}by its owners because estate 
{workers}from their saw mill went there
 at lunchtime and got{too drunk to}do  
 any more{work.}It's now a house called
 Oakdene and bears the date 1891.      
{(2)}By{Winsley hill}is{Cold Ash.}It   
 was a farm with several cottages close
 by.One of these{cottages,}which no    
 longer exist,was known as{The Donkey's
{Arms.}Probably it wasn't a pub at all,
 but a place where{Scrumpy}(home made  
 rough cider) was sold to any farm     
 labourer who wanted it.               
 NOTE: There is{no public house in Hope
 The nearest is The Railway at Dinmore.</content>
