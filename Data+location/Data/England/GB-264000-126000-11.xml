		<title>11Interview: local resident</title>
		<content> Mr. Tucker interview continued.       
 At school he had to take a packed     
 lunch, mainly sandwiches and cheese.  
 At the school there was a watering-can
 full of water which you could drink   
 from.  If you forgot your packed lunch
 you would have to go without a meal.  
 When Mr. Tucker left school he went to
 work on a farm which he enjoyed alot. 
 In his job he got paid half-a-crown a 
 week.  When he was young he enjoyed   
 football and swimming in the river.   
 He has seen many changes in the area. 
 Some were for the better and some were
 not.  In the holidays he spent his    
 time at home and down in the village  
 park.                                 
 He, too, can remember the queen as a  
 princess staying at Castle Hill.
