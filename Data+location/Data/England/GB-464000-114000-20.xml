		<title>20SOCIAL CONCERNS IN HAMBLEDON</title>
		<content> A sample survey of the households in  
 the study area was undertaken and     
 these are the trends that were noted: 
{Hambledon}has an ageing population,   
 with a high proportion of residents   
 of pensionable age.  A small core of  
 residents have lived in{Hambledon}all 
 their lives as their parents and      
 grandparents did.  Many residents     
 commute to Portsmouth, Southampton and
 London and many others have retired   
 here from S. England.  Therefore,     
 house prices have risen and some      
{Hambledon}born residents cannot buy a 
 home there.                           
{ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:  We would like to   
{thank all the residents of Hambledon  
{for their interest and cooperation. In
{particular we would express our       
{gratitude to Commander Goldsmith and  
{Colonel Roberts, and to Dr.Garland for
{his help with the household survey.   </content>
