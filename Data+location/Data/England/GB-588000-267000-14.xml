		<content>The Bunburys originated in Cheshire.   
Barton Hall was built by Robert Audley 
at the beginning C17th. Thos. Hanmer   
left Barton to his nephew Sir William  
Bunbury who came to modernise and live 
in the Hall in 1748. The house contain-
ed a gallery of fine pictures. Oliver  
Goldsmith visited often. Sir Henry Ed. 
Bunbury added to the house in 1821 and 
made extensive pleasure grounds.       
Four almshouses were built by Lieut.Gen
Sir Henry Bunbury K.C.G.M.P. 7th Bart. 
in memory of his first wife Louisa     
Emilia.                                
Henry William Bunbury was a well known 
caricaturist in mid C19th.             
At the end of the C18th a Bunbury lost 
the chance on the turn of a card of    
having a famous horse race named after 
him. It is now known as the Derby. How-
ever he won the first Derby with Diomed
and another with the filly Eleanor.    </content>
