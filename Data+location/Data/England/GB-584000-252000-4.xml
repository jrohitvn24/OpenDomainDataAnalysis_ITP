		<content>Within our area we have 2 shops half a 
mile apart. One is an C18, timberframed
and plastered cottage which uses the   
front room as a tiny sub post office &amp; 
general store. Cramming a wide range of
assorted stock,including bread,pastries
fresh vegetables,stationery,toiletries 
&amp; wines &amp; spirits, into the tiny       
space. This shop is a very important   
part of the village as it tends to be  
a meeting place,especially for the     
older folk on Thursday, when pensions  
are paid. As it is situated opposite   
the village school and church, it is   
considered the centre of the rather    
spreadout village. The second shop is  
a new mini Mace Super- market built on 
a small new housing development in the 
newer part of the village. This also   
offers a very wide range of goods and  
two extra services, dry cleaning &amp;     
shoe repairs.                          </content>
