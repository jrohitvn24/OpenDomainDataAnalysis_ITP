		<title>09A Day In My Life.</title>
		<content> On a schoolday I get up at 7.30 a.m.  
 and I get washed. I go back into my   
 bedroom and get dressed. Then I go    
 downstairs and make my breakfast. I go
 into the living room and watch        
 television and eat my cornflakes. When
 I have finished my breakfast, I go    
 down to the bus-stop and wait for the 
 bus. When the bus comes I get my      
 bus-pass out and show the bus driver. 
 We travel 3 miles to Boynton school.  
 First we do assembly and then         
 handwriting. Then I do mathematics and
 English. I have my dinner at 12       
 o'clock and I go home at 3.30 p.m.    
 When I get home I have my tea with my 
 mother and sisters. Then I play out   
 until 6.30 p.m. I watch television    
 until 8.30 p.m. and then I get my     
 pyjamas on. I have some supper and I  
 go to bed.                            
                                       </content>
