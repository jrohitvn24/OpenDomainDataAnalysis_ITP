		<content>{West View Stores}is owned by the Mann 
 family. It has a fairly varied        
 selection of things; apart from many  
 different foods there are a few       
 cleaning things, and just recently    
 they started a butchery section.      
 The{Post Office}is in the stores.     
   The{Corner Shop}sells second hand   
 furniture and things like that, it is 
 owned and run by Mr and Mrs Lee.      
   The old butcher's shop is empty, it 
 will probably be made into an antique 
 shop for visitors. There are fewer    
 shops in Broughton than there used to 
 be years ago.                         
   There are two public houses, the{   
{Grey Hound}and the{Tally Ho.}They are 
 both very popular with the local      
 people and visitors.
