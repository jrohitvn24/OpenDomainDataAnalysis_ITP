		<title>01S.E. HUDDERSFIELD: Overview</title>
		<content>    The survey area comprises a 4km x  
 3km block east of{Huddersfield}town   
 centre.  Going from West to East of   
 our block, the suburbs of Huddersfield
 give way to a more rural landscape.   
    There are four major built-up areas
 from which most of the material has   
 been gathered.{Ravensknowle/Dalton}is 
 closest to Huddersfield centre.  It   
 includes Ravensknowle Museum and Park,
 council houses and Victorian terraces.
{Dalton/Waterloo}has housing, light    
 industry, a shopping centre and       
 industrial complex.{Almondbury        
 pre-dates the lO86 survey, but the    
 modern village is a mixture of private
 housing, council houses and historic  
 buildings.                            
   {Lepton}forms a triangle between the
 A629 and A642, and has a shopping     
 centre, private and council houses,   
 two churches and three schools.       </content>
