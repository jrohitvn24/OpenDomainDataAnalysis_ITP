		<title>16The Gypsy site, Lullington</title>
		<content>   The gypsy camp between Lullington   
 and Coton is classed as a short stay  
 site. For this reason the cost of     
 an overnight stay increases from Â£1 in
 the first week to Â£2 in the following 
 week. After spending 2 weeks at the   
 site the gypsies have to leave.       
   Gypsies visiting the site come from 
 all parts of Great Britain. There tend
 to be slightly more caravans in the   
 area in the winter.                   
   A gypsy warden and his family live  
 permanently on the site. He ensures   
 that the basic facilities (fresh water
 and toilets) are available. He also   
 has to deal with any social problems  
 between the local people and gypsies. 
 No incident has needed police         
 involvement to date but the gypsies   
 were not welcomed in the area, a fact 
 made worse by bad media coverage.
