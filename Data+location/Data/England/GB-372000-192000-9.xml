		<title>09CHANGES IN WOTTON</title>
		<content>  100 YEARS AGO WOTTON WAS INHABITED BY
 COUNTRY PEOPLE AND ANIMALS. HORSES,   
 CARTS AND CARRIAGES WERE IMPORTANT    
 FEATURES, WATER WAS PUMPED FROM WELLS 
 AND MOST INHABITANTS WERE BORN,       
 MARRIED AND DIED IN WOTTON. 10        
 CHILDREN TO A FAMILY WAS NORMAL.      
 POACHING WAS PROBABLY THE MOST COMMON 
 CRIME BEFORE 1914. ON GOOD FRIDAY     
 AFTERNOON IT WAS THE CUSTOM TO WALK TO
 NIBLEY KNOLL. THIS AND OTHER CUSTOMS  
 SUCH AS MAYPOLE DANCING, MAY WALKING  
 AND TRADITIONAL CHILDRENS' GAMES DIED 
 WHEN THE MOTOR CAR BECAME POPULAR. THE
 FIRST COUNCIL HOUSES WERE BUILT AFTER 
 WORLD WAR 1 IN LISLE PLACE. GRADUALLY 
 FIELDS AND ANIMALS RECEDED. YOUNG     
 WOTTONIANS BEGAN LEAVING HOME TO WORK 
 IN THE TOWNS AND PEOPLE FROM THE TOWNS
 WERE MOVING OUT TO LIVE IN THE        
 COUNTRY. BY THE END OF THE 1930s OLD  
 WOTTON WAS LOST FOR EVER.             </content>
