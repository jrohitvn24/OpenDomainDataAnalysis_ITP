 In Pitney the roads were first        
 surfaced at the beginning of the      
 century about 1920. They had problems 
 with the drainage while constructing  
 the roads. The roads are surfaced     
 properly in Pitney once every eight   
 years and this costs approximately    
 Â£4000 for 6000 square metres. The     
 roads are kept up to standard by      
 maintenance every year which costs    
 approximately Â£1148. In 1979 the roads
 were re_surfaced costing Â£8150 for    
 6000 metres.
