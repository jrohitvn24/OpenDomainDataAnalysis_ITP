		<title>12The Royal Oak,Little Bradley</title>
		<content>    The Royal Oak is one of several    
 attractive local public houses in this
 area.The building dates from the      
 1880's and there is an eighty-foot    
 deep well in the garden.Before it was 
 a public house,the building was used  
 as a garage and a petrol              
 station.During the Second World       
 War,because of it's close proximity to
 the airfield at Stradishall,it was    
 used by airmen of two fighter         
 squadrons,who autographed the walls   
 and ceiling.Unfortunately this has now
 been painted over.                    
    The Royal Oak is a free house and  
 sells a wide selection of beers,the   
 most popular of which is Greene       
 King,brewed at Bury St. Edmunds.      
 Families are welcome in the new       
 dining-room,where a varied menu is    
 available.
