		<title>14St.Germans Village Sign</title>
		<content> The village of St.Germans is named    
 after St.Germanus, an early bishop who
 worked in France. As a boy and young  
 man, he is reputed to have been a     
 woodcutter, and the village sign (a   
 painted woodcarving which tops a pole 
 at the entrance to the village) shows 
 him felling a tree, in red            
 knickerbockers and a blue plush       
 shirt.                                
                                       
 He hunted and enjoyed life...then a   
 vision turned him overnight into      
 a saintly Christian, who became first 
 a minister and then a bishop.         
                                       
 The Saint's story is told more fully  
 on famous pew-end woodcarvings in the 
 village church. These were partially  
 defaced by Cromwell's army, but are   
 still a powerful reminder of the past.
