		<title>11Changes in Colney Heath</title>
		<content> Colney Heath has changed a lot over   
 the last 30 years. We asked people who
 have lived in the village all their   
 lives what it was like when they were 
 younger.{New housing estates}have been
 built. All of these roads are new:{   
{Cutmore Drive, Meadway, Hall Gardens, 
{Franklin Close and Admirals Close.}   
 There used to be a factory where      
 Cutmore Drive is. There used to be a {
{butchers shop, 2 black smiths, a      
{grocers and a general store.}Now      
 there is a {newsagents, hairdressers, 
{supermarket and post office.}There was
 an {old school}in Colney Heath built  
 in {1814.}It had high windows. A new  
 primary school was built in{1966}and  
 the old school has now been knocked   
 down. The A1 is being widened near    
 Colney Heath and some of the access   
 roads are going to be closed off.
