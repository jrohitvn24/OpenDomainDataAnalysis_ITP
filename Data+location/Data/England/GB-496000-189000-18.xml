		<content>{ Gold Hill Common} - The Jolly Farmer 
is the only Public House on Gold Hill. 
It has a beautiful view over the       
valley in which lies the village of    
{Chalfont St Peter}.It used to be a    
small inn until about 50 years ago     
when it was demolished and enlarged.   
Gold Hill Baptist Church was built     
over a century ago. Originally there   
was an old Chapel which was built in   
1790 and was eventually demolished in  
1870. The white house that was near    
the pond has also been demolished to   
make way for an old peoples home. It   
was named Hibberts Lodge. The pond has 
been filled in. The other old cottages 
are still there. Near the bottom of    
Gold Hill is a{Coronation  Clock},     
which was designed by Robert Brown in  
his {smithy} in Joiners Lane. The slope
on Gold Hill Common is very popular for
sledging in the Winter.                </content>
