		<content>{(SUNDON PARK AND MARSH FARM ESTATES   
{CONTINUED)}Private houses are either  
 detached or semi's. Most council      
 houses were built in the late         
 60's,early 70's, but some in the late 
 70's early 80's.Private houses were   
 built around the mid 70's. In the     
 council estates there are small open  
 spaces and concrete play areas which  
 had been slightly vandalised.Larger   
 open spaces are found in the private  
 areas. Private houses have larger     
 gardens than council houses. Buses    
 only pass through council house areas.
 Council houses have garages in mass   
 blocks,whilst private houses have them
 joined to the house.                  
 The area in the North of Luton and to 
 the west of the A1 is only now being  
 built upon.The new estate of Barton   
 Hills is currently under construction.
