		<content> A large rural block which includes the
 hamlets of Eskham, Wragholme and      
 Ludney.                               
 It lies astride the A.1031 road,      
 bounded by Marshchapel to the North,  
 Conisholme to the South, the Louth    
 Navigation Canal to the West and the  
 sea to the East.                      
 The area is flat, with fertile, silty 
 soil to the east of the main road, but
 generally much heavier to the west.   
 Chief crops are cereals and potatoes, 
 and good grazing land.                
 Its principle features are            
 St.Clement's Church, Grainthorpe, at  
 the S.E. corner, with its 14th century
 brass cross, to St. Mary's Church,    
 Marshchapel, at the N.W. corner, with 
 a monument to the Harpham family dated
 1617.                                 
 Deep reed lined dykes border most of  
 the roads.                            </content>
