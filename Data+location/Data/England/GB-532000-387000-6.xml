		<title>06Crime in Louth</title>
		<content> From our research on crime we         
 understand that the crime rate in     
 Louth is a minor problem. We          
 interviewed the police. This showed us
 the commonest crimes are thefts and   
 damage. Vandals are between the ages  
 of 14 and 21. Shoplifting continues to
 be the commonest offence committed by 
 juveniles. A local newspaper reporter 
 was interviewed. She said the crimes  
 which hit the headlines most are arson
 and vandalism. She thought by         
 reporting crimes in the paper it      
 prevented other crimes being          
 committed. Heads were interviewed from
 four schools. They said the           
 punishment should fit the crime. There
 doesn't seem to be a large amount of  
 crime in Louth. It is still rising    
 though, and probably will continue to 
 do so in the future.
