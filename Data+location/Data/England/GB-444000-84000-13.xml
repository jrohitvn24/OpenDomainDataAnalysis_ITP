{Sunday evening, and afterwards the    
{whole family would go for a walk      
{together."}So said one of the older

{congregation of the Parish church in  
{nearbye Shorwell "is far smaller, and 
{afterwards they go home and switch on 
{the telly."

 suggested that{"the Church has not    
{moved with the times. Everything else 
{has changed so why not the Church?"}  </content>
