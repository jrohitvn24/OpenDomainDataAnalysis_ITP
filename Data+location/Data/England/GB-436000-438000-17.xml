		<title>17WORK IN THORNER &amp; DISTRICT</title>
		<content> As may be expected there are few work 
 opportunities in Thorner, besides     
 those offered in local services and   
 farming, the shops, garage, public    
 houses and riding stables.            
                                       
 Thorner is a 'commuter' village - most
 people travel to their place of work, 
 often in Leeds.                       
                                       
 There are many people in Thorner in   
 social classes I and II, in terms of  
 the Registrar General's               
 classification.                       
                                       
 This means there are many             
 professional, managerial and technical
 workers in residence in Thorner in    
 1985.
