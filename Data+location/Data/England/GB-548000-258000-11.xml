		<content>   Fen Ditton "Campo" probably got its 
 name from its use by soldiers in the  
 World War 1 for trench-digging        
 training, which was the reason for its
 once very uneven surface. About 5     
 years ago the Campo was acquired by   
 the Parish Council from Major Francis 
 of Quy Hall for use as a recreation   
 ground. It was then levelled over a   
 period of two years and then seeded   
 and left for further year.            
   The new recreation ground is        
 administered by a committee, of which 
 Mr. Marson is a member.  Cricket and  
 footballing interests are represented.
 A pavilion is being built on the site 
 by local voluntary labour.            
   In 1981 Mr. Marson and Mr. Lovell   
 formed the Fen Ditton Rangers boys    
 gootball team. The team joined the    
 "Colts" league and is in 1985 in      
 second place in the league.           </content>
