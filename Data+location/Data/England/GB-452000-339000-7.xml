		<title>07SHIPSTONE'S BREWERY (CONTD)</title>
		<content> In 1935,{Mr Kirkland}started work at  
 the brewery and looked after the{     
{horses.}The horses came to Shipstone's
 when they were 5 years old and retired
 when they were 20 years old. Mr. K.   
 said the horse would{'weep when they  
{were distressed'.}                    
                                       
{Mr. Spence}remembers how much the     
 people in{Basford}liked the horses.   
 The women would spread ashes from the 
 hearthfire on the roads in the winter 
 so that the horse would not slip.     
                                       
 There have been lots of changes at the
 brewery over the years. Mr. Spence    
 still works there and earns{109}      
 pounds a week. He still doesn't like  
 going into the caves, though, because 
 of the{rats.}                         
                                       
                                       </content>
