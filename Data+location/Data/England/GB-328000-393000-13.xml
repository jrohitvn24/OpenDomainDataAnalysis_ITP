		<content>     In 1830 Mr James Atherton         
 purchased one hundred and seventy     
 acres of sandhills and heathland in   
 the area now known as New Brighton. Mr
 Atherton was a retired LIverpool      
 merchant who had made his fortune in  
 building and land speculation. His    
 idea was to build houses in such a way
 that  each building  would have a fine
 view and be surrounded by plenty of   
 land. The building would be situated  
 so that one would not interfere with  
 the view of another.                  
 Plans for New Brighton included the   
 building of a church, market-place,   
 shops, baths, reading rooms, billiard 
 hall and a post office. Mr.Atherton   
 speculated that the cost of the       
 undertaking would be about Â£12,000    
 which could be raised by selling      
 shares at Â£100 each.
