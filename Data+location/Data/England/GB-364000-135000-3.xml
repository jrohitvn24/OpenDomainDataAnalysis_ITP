		<title>03 FARMING IN THE BRUTON AREA</title>
		<content>   Most of the land in this area is    
used for grazing dairy cattle.The area 
is hilly so there is not much corn     
grown and it is also very wet.Some     
sheep and beef cattle graze on the     
wasteland on the hills.There are some  
vineyards quite near Castle Cary,they  
are grown on sloping land.It covers a  
large area of land.The dairy cows are  
milked twice a day.In summer the cows  
are left out in the fields and brought 
in for milking when needed.They are    
milked early in the morning and early  
afternoon.In winter they are kept in   
barns and are fed on hay and           
silage.Crops are not grown very much   
because the land is hilly and on the   
hills,very wet.
