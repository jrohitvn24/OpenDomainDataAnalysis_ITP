		<title>05FURNITURE RESTORERS</title>
		<content>    The antique restorers is not in the
 very centre of Horseheath it is on the
 edge of Horseheath.The furniture      
 restorers is quite old and first of   
 all was horse stables(built of        
 clunch.)The owners of the antique     
 restorers are Mr. Short and Mr. Polley
 they are the only people who work on  
 the skilful restoration. Mr. Polley   
 runs the upholstery part and Mr. Short
 runs the cabinet making.We did a      
 survey on how many customers came in  
 every day for a week,we found out that
 on week days Mr. Short and Mr.Polley  
 normally have 1 customer every day but
 not on Saturdays when they can expect 
 2to3 customers.The oldest antique they
 have ever sold was a chest of         
 drawers.They do not only restore      
 antiques they copy old and valuable   
 items like chairs,cabinets,tables,and 
 clocks.                               </content>
