		<title>04Farmland in Brookmans Park</title>
		<content>    We visited a typical farm in the   
 area. There were 200 acres of oats,   
 wheat and barley used mainly for      
 cattle feed and 100 acres arable land.
    There are 150 Friesian cows and a  
 Blonde Aquitaine bull.The farm is     
 worked by two adults and a boy.There  
 are 4 tractors,a combine harvester,a  
 baler and a slurry tank.              
    Mr Morgan, the farmer, has been    
 farming here for forty years and      
 complains that even though he uses his
 land to the full he finds it difficult
 to make a reasonable profit. In this  
 last year he made Â£4000 less than the 
 previous year.                        
    From one cow he gets about 150     
 litres of milk per week which is about
 50 000 pints from all the cows.
