		<content> Mr Aldridge's favourite time of year  
 is the spring when everything goes    
 green and starts to come alive.  He   
 enjoys helping people to use their    
 tackle correctly and he can show them 
 where the fish like to lie in the     
 river.  This part of the River Test is
 split up into twelve beats and two    
 fishermen can fish for salmon or trout
 on each one.  It costs thirty pounds a
 day each.  There are four men looking 
 after the twelve beats.  They have to 
 spend a lot of time repairing         
 breakwaters, making bridges and       
 clearing weed from the river bed.  It 
 can be miserable in the winter.  The  
 young trout also have to be reared and
 fed.  He often works from 8 am until 8
 pm but he loves the outdoor life.     
 When Mr Aldridge does have a few days 
 off, away from his job at Broadlands, 
 he likes to do a spot of fishing.     </content>
