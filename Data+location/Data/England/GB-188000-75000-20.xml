		<title>20PADSTOW ARTIST'S SKETCH CLUB</title>
		<content> Nationally known artist Kevin Platt   
 runs a fortnightly Art Club for       
 children.It meets on Tuesdays during  
 the winter and we do all different    
 kinds of drawing so we do not get     
 bored.                                
  Kevin Platt was born in the North of 
 England but moved to Padstow over 10  
 years ago to set up his studio here.He
 specialises in paintings of old       
 Padstow and S.W.England in the early  
 20th Century.He was commissioned by   
 the R.N.L.I.to paint a set of four    
 plates depicting lifeboats in action  
 (including the Padstow lifeboat the   
 "Catherine and James Macfarlane"),with
 the proceeds from the sale of the     
 limited edition going to the R.N.L.I. 
 He has also spent many summers in the 
 South of France, encapturing the mood 
 of the more rural side of the country 
 in his paintings.                     </content>
