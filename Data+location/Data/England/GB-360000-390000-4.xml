		<content> During the past four years I have been
 a pupil at St.Stephen's Roman Catholic
 Aided Junior School.I am in the 4th   
 year now and have to leave at the end 
 of this term. I am very frightened. I 
 will be going to English Martyrs'R.C. 
 Comprehensive School in September     
 after the long holiday. It is on the  
 same site as our school but the two   
 schools are very different. The       
 comprehensive school is so big that I 
 am afraid that I will get lost.There  
 will be three forms of entry for 1st  
 year pupils and many of my friends    
 will be in other classes to me.       
 The older classes have more than 3    
 forms but there are fewer children now
 than there once were so classes are   
 getting fewer too.
