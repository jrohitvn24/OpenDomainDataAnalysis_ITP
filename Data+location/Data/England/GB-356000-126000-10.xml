		<content>      Most of the people living in     
 Babcary seem to live a quiet life,    
 only really going out of Babcary when 
 shopping. Most people are retired in  
 the middle of Babcary and enjoy       
 gardening and garden parties.         
      The people in Babcary are very   
 "community-minded" and do their best  
 to help each other. There is a        
 "Home-Market" at one of the big houses
 every Saturday where they sell their  
 own produce (cakes, vegetables and    
 fruit).                               
      The farmers live an almost       
 "clock-work" year: milking, sowing,   
 harvesting, calving etc., and miss out
 on many special days like Christmas,  
 because the cows must always be milked
 at the same time, and so on.          
      Hazlegrovians also live a        
 "clock-work" type of life, however    
 they all have their holidays.         </content>
