		<title>15Housing Conditions</title>
		<content> Ownership varies from private housing 
 of recent development to NCB owned    
 'Pit Rows' and council controlled     
 estates.Residents were interviewed and
 gave their opinion concerning         
 conditions: (Milfield Court comprises 
 three-bedroomed terrace housing.      
 Gardens were small and the children   
 had little play area because the court
 fronted onto Bedlington Main Street.  
 Barrington Court: also provides easy  
 access to the shops but the houses are
 larger. The Chesters: is a new estate 
 of semi-detached houses. The estate   
 was considered friendly but there was 
 little for the children to do. Pit    
 Rows are traditionally friendly       
 places.  Hollymount Square: was a     
 council estate and very quiet.  The   
 residents were delighted with recent  
 modernization schemes.
