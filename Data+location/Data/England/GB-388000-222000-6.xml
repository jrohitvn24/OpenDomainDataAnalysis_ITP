 12 farms were visited and these are   
 samples of the replies. All the       
 farmers were asked about conservation 
 and all agreed that it was important. 
 There were foxes, badgers weasels,    
 hares, rabbits, pheasants  and many   
 species of birds. Some farmers        
 admitted that the use of their hedgers
 did spoil habitat but then so did the 
 litter often dumped around the hedges 
 by the'townies'.Farmers were not poor.</content>
