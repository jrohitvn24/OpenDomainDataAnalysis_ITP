		<title>11HUNWICK VILLAGE</title>
		<content> One of the most interesting things in 
 Hunwick is the village green.On it is 
 an old "gin" or engine house for horse
 powered machinery.To the North        
 there is a hall called Helmington Hall
 which is part of a much larger house  
 of 1686.Hunwick Hall is the other very
 old building.There were once pipeworks
 and brickworks in Hunwick because of  
 good clay deposits,but the pipeworks  
 have closed.The brickworks however    
 are thriving,being a specialist firm  
 producing refactory products.Once     
 there was a railway station in        
 Hunwick,the railway line connecting   
 Bishop Auckland and Durham.This was   
 uproated in the 1950s.There were      
 remains of a Roman Road in Hunwick,   
 but they were ploughed up.The road    
 probably went to Binchester Roman     
 Fort which is across the River Wear.
