		<title>15Historical Houses</title>
		<content> There are a number of historical      
 houses in Hatfield Peverel.  Here is  
 some information about three of them. 
 Toppinghoe Hall is about four hundred 
 years old, originally there were two  
 houses and it is believed that Oliver 
 Cromwell's  neice once lived there.   
 Both houses were in ruins until about 
 1965 when the older of the two was    
 renovated and extended.  All that     
 remains of the other house is two     
 walls propped up with poles.          
 Toppinghoe Hall is now owned by Strutt
 and Parker Estate Agents but Lady     
 Sinclair lives there as a tenant.     
 Crix is another interesting old house,
 it was built in 1768 after the        
 original medieval house by the river  
 was knocked down because it was damp  
 inside.  It was thought that the house
 got this unusual name because the     
 original owners were called De Cryke  </content>
