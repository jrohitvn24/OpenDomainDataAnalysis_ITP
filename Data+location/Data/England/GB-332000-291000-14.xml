		<title>14HOUSING - Lydham/More</title>
		<content> Majority of houses are old, built     
 of stone and modernised within the    
 last 20 yrs.  Some are still 'tied' to
 jobs on Linley Estate. Most houses in 
 the past were connected with agri-    
 culture but less so today.  Both      
 villages have{council houses,}22 in   
 Lydham (rent approx Â£17 weekly), built
 of red brick; 4 in More (Â£15 weekly)  
 built of blocks made at the More      
 quarry.  The Old Rectory and Church   
 Farm at More are black and white timb-
 ered houses. {New houses}in the area  
 are mainly red brick{bungalows}which  
 cost approx Â£22,000 to build with an  
 additional Â£5-7,000 for a building    
 plot.  Plots are not easily available.
 At present there are none in the      
 Lydham/More area unless connected with
 agriculture. {Mains water}to most     
 houses.  No mains{sewage,}only septic 
 tanks and soak away drainage.         </content>
