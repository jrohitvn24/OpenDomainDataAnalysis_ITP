		<content>  The Granary Arts and Crafts Centre   
 used to be a barn but in 1978 a       
 preservation order was placed on the  
 whole farm as being typical of the    
 architecture of the time.It had been  
 slowly going to ruins over the years  
 but it had to be restored.It was      
 finally opened on the third August    
 1983 by the Mayor of Scarborough,Dr.D.
 Jeffels.The Centre is divided into    
 separate workshops.These include a    
 carpentry workshop,a pot &amp; china model
 shop with gnomes,wickerwork and       
 stained glass windows on display.There
 are also over 50 fish tanks in the    
 aquarium.The rooms are rented out     
 separately for people to do their own 
 hobbies in.Upstairs is a screen       
 printing workshop,&amp; a dress making    
 shop,where prints are made for T-     
 shirts.As the owners have day jobs the
 Centre opens evenings &amp; weekends only.</content>
