 Most people in the area have a{private
{motor vehicle}such as a car or        
 Land Rover.There is little{public     
{transport}and only two regular bus    
 services.There used to be more.Buses  
 also transport children to secondary  
 school and schoolchildren on trips or 
 to the swimming baths at Buxton.      
 Primary school children are brought to
 school in a{taxi}and taken home each  
 day. Many{heavy lorries}and cars come 
 through the Village causing a lot of  
 noise and dirt.Few of them stop.Winter
 weather can often{block the roads}and 
 the road can be closed for several    
 days after a severe snow.In summer    
 there is a lot of{tourist traffic.
