		<title>07Shops in Coddenham Area</title>
		<content> There is a good old-fashioned butcher 
 shop in Coddenham with adjacent       
 slaughterhouse. Homemade sausages are 
 the speciality of the butcher and     
 deliveries are made far afield by van.
 The Post Office is housed in a lovely 
 timber-framed building and also sells 
 stationery, wool and gifts. An antique
 shop has recently opened next to the  
 village store and is a futher         
 attraction for visitors to the area. A
 small craft shop in Coddenham High St 
 sells high quality hand crafted goods.
 The Public House in Coddenham called  
 the Dukes Head was for many years the 
 favourite hostelry of a famous        
 cartoonist. The Public House near     
 Hemingstone is called the Cross Keys. 
 Milk is delivered daily, mobile       
 grocery and fish van and a bakery van 
 call regularly. A shop at Hemingstone 
 Fruit Farm sells fruit and vegetables.</content>
