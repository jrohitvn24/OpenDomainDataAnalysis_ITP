 Mayor to the Borough of East Yorkshire
{Q. What are the main changes you have 
{seen in Pocklington over the years.}  
 A. Over the last 50 years the         
 population has increased a lot, as has
 the number of houses.                 
{Q. Is Burnby Hall of importance to    
{Pocklington. }                        
 A. Yes it's important to the whole of 
 Yorkshire. Although the lakes in the  
 gardens are man made, they're ideal   
 for the water lilies which are reputed
 to be one of the best collections in  
 Europe.                               
{Q. What are the plans for the future  
{of Burnby Hall Gardens.}              
 A. We hope to bring Primrose Wood into
 public use. It's about the same size  
 as the parts of the gardens now open  
 to the public, and we hope to open it 
 as a nature reserve and nature walk.  </content>
