 and sheep.Crops grown are grass,wheat,
 oats,barley,potatoes,turnips and      
 mangolds for cattle.The River Wiske is
 to the south of Appleton Wiske and    
 flows from east to west.              
 It has recently been dredged to       
 prevent flooding of adjacent fields.  
 It is crossed by a roadbridge,and a   
 footbridge which are about 250m apart.
 The river is only small being about   
 3.5m wide and 30m deep at the road    
 bridge.The flow was calculated to be  
 about 2 cubic metres a minute.        
 Sticklebacks are plentifull in the    
 river but only the 3 spined variety   </content>
