		<content>   Willington is situated around a     
 cross-roads. The roads which cross are
 the A5132 ,which runs between         
 Willington and Swarkestone, and the   
 B5008,which goes between              
 Willington(A38) and Repton village.   
 Running parallel to the B5008 is the  
 A38 Trunk Road between Derby and      
 Birmingham.                           
   In addition two sets of railway     
 lines pass through Willington:        
 (a) the Derby-Uttoxeter line, and     
 (b) the Derby-Birmingham line passing 
 through Burton-on-Trent.              
   In years past Willington was a busy 
 calling point on the canal system of  
 England and the Trent and Mersey canal
 passes through the village. The canal 
 today has no trade purpose at all. It 
 is merely a stopping point or rest    
 stop for tourist's canal cruisers.
