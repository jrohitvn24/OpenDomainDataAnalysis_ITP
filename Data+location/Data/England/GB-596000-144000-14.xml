		<title>14POTTERS CORNER (2)</title>
		<content> This square is fairly flat and open.  
                                       
 There are three roads in the area, two
 of these roads run over the railway.  
 The road bridges are within sight of  
 each other. The railway has just two  
 tracks which run past the{golf course 
 which covers a small proportion of the
 area.                                 
                                       
 A new development of this area is the 
 extention of the{M20 Motor-way}shortly
 due start. This motor-way will run    
 through part of the golf course and   
 along the N.E. of the railway line.   
                                       
 A number of the houses near the       
 railway line will be demolished to    
 make way for the{M20.}Of those local  
 people interviewed, there were none   
 who objected strongly to the{M20      
 extention.                            </content>
