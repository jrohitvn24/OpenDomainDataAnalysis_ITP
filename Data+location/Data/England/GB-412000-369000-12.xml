		<title>12What Youngsters Need</title>
		<content>       Most Taddington youngsters own a
 BMX BIKE.However,there is no track for
 the bikes to be put to full use.The   
 teenaged boys did build a track a year
 ago,but owing to Taddington's extreme 
 weather it slowly decayed because it  
 was made of wood and hard mud.        
    A new recreation area is needed    
 since the present one which has two   
 swings and a slide is on a hillside.  
 The school field is available for us  
 to play on,but it is ridged and on the
 edge of the village.There are large   
 flat fields down in the village which 
 would be suitable and might encourage 
 football and cricket clubs to start up
 again.                                
    A hazard in the village is the     
 shortage of pavements and car parking 
 spaces.Taddington attracts hikers and 
 tourists who  often tend to park in   
 unsuitable places.                    </content>
