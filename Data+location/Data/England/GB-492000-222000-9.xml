		<title>09CARNIVAL TIME AT LEIGHTON</title>
		<content>  The Leighton Buzzard Carnival was    
 started in 1960 and is organised by a 
 volunteer committee, it is held every 
 year at Parsons Close, and is a day of
 fun for everyone. Lorries are         
 converted into floats by people from  
 Clubs, Associations and Local Firms.  
 They are very colourful and show      
 different scenes. Children and adults 
 wearing gay costumes go on the floats.
 In the late  afternoon they parade    
 through the town and local areas. In  
 an arena there are displays by        
 dancers, bands, gymnasts or other     
 things people will enjoy watching.    
 Side shows are arranged by local      
 organizations who keep 50% of any     
 profit made. The remainder together   
 with any other profits from the       
 carnival are donated to local         
 charities. There is also a fair in the
 park with roundabouts and rides.      </content>
