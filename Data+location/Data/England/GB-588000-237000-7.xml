Mr Gooden is the school caretaker he   
has been here seventeen years just     
before the school opened in 1968.      
In April 1966 the infants opened. In   
September 1963 the Juniors opened.     
First of all it was 5-11 years old. In 
1974 it became one of the first schools
to start doing 5-9 years old. When the 
school opened there were 16 teachers   
including the headmaster Mr Blakey. Now
there are 12 teachers including        
headmaster Mr Darby. In 1968 there were
about 550 children in the school with  
about 40 children in each class. Now   
there are about 295 children and about 
30 in each class. There is a swimming  
pool. Swimming is taught by Mrs Cotton 
during the summer term only. The       
children start school at 9am           
and end at 12 noon for lunch. At       
1.30pm they start again until 3.30pm.  </content>
