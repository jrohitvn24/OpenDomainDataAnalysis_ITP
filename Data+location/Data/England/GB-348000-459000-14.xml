		<title>14Auction Market .2        (M)</title>
		<content>continued from page 13                 
 Most of the animals we saw being      
bought will go to farms to be fattened 
up for the Autumn. Some are sold for   
breeding some for meat. 16 full-time   
and 20 part-timers work at the market. 
It was started in 1885 in the town     
centre and was moved to its present    
site quite recently. We wrote some     
poems about our visit. Here is one by  
Sarah Jones.                           
                                       
            Smell                      
    There was a horrible smell,        
    It was lurking in every corner     
    Men were jabbering on,             
    Cattle mooing and sheep baaing     
    Other people were shouting and     
    there was the sound of whipping    
    sticks.
