		<content>     The construction of the{Crieff    
{railway}started on the 21st of        
 September 1854.  The cost of          
 construction was Â£65,000.  The line   
 went to{Perth}via{Methven}and was     
 extended West to{Comrie.              
     The opening of the railway was one
 of the biggest events in the history  
 of Crieff.  The day was made into a   
 public holiday.                       
     The rail has now been closed down.
  While the route of the railway is    
 left, the tracks and sleepers have now
 been removed.
