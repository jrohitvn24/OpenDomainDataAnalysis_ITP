		<content>{We guessed that there are 1107 houses 
{lived in around Lyndhurst, and if     
{about three people lived in them there
{would be about 3000 people.}Queens    
 house stands where the old Manor house
 used to be.{The Verderers hall was    
{built in 1388, here sits the court the
{second oldest court in England.       
 Northerwood House 1700, now let as    
 flats.{Forest dwellings use to be made
{from mud, cowdung, horse hair etc some
{examples still remain.}Thatched       
 cottages exist.{Houses built around   
{1900 are of brick and slate roof.     
 There are three council house sites.  
{House prices are high Â£60,000 (three  
{bedrooms) because of a shortage of    
{land.}Land is either for farms, or the
 Forestry commission.{New houses are   
{built when houses with large gardens  
{are sold and the site is re developed.
 The village can not be enlarged.      </content>
