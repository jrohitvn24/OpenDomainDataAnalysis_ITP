		<title>12 CASTLE CARY VINEYARDS.</title>
		<content>     Castle Cary Vineyards are on      
Honeywick Hill,between Bruton and      
Castle Cary.The vineyard was started   
in 1979 by Christopher and Gilly       
Woosnam Mills,with a planting of a     
quarter of a hectare of Muller Thurgau 
vines from Germany.Further vines were  
added in 1980 and the first harvest was
collected in 1982,the first vintage.   
    The vineyards now have another one 
and a half hectares of different German
and French grapes.The vintages of 1983 
and 1984 are a blend of grapes and the 
wine is a medium dry white with a fine 
bouquet and a fresh fruity taste,ideal 
for summer drinking,with a light meal  
or on its own.                         
    The vineyards do not make the wine 
themselves,but send the grapes to Nigel
Godden at the Pilton Manor Vineyard.
