		<title>20Recent Changes In Billericay</title>
		<content>      In the past there were more      
 residential houses than shops in the{ 
{High Street}. As the town grew the    
 houses were either altered or         
 demolished to provide shops, chain    
 store premises and offices to satisfy 
 the needs of a growing town.          
      In 1947 there was{one primary    
{school}. Now there are{6}. All the    
 boys wore school caps. Hardly any boys
 wear caps these days. They also wore  
 shorts that came down to their knees. 
 Nowadays most boys wear long trousers 
 for school.                           
      In the 1960s{electricity}replaced
{gas}in lighting the High Street.      
      Billericay grew up around the    
 junction of roads to{Chelmsford}and{  
{Tilbury, London }and{Southend}. It is 
 now a part of the{Basildon Council    
{District.}
