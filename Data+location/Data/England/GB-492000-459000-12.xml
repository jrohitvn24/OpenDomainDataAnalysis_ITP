      In the top righr hand corner of  
 this area is the Sledmere Monument    
 built in 1867 in memory of Sir Tatton 
 Sykes and paid for by the workers on  
 his estate to show how much they liked
 him.                                  
                                       
      It can be seen for miles around  
 as it stands 60 feet high and the view
 from here is one of the best in the   
 area.On a clear day you can see       
 Beverley Minster and as far as all the
 buildings on the Humber.              
                                       
      The monument has carvings on it  
 that show Sir Tatton and a message to 
 say how much he was appreciated.He    
 paid for the church to be repaired and
 for our school to be built.
