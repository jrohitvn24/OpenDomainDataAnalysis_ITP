		<title>08Playground games at Lydden</title>
		<content>At our school we play these two games. 
                 Go!                   
                 ==                    
Someone stands in the middle of the    
playground and shouts "Go!"The idea is 
to"add"people before they get to the   
other side.The one who gets"had"first  
is "on it".                            
               Red Rover               
               =========               
You need 20 - 40 people to play this   
game.Half of the children go on one    
side of the playground.Somebody shouts 
"Red Rover".We call somebody from the  
other side over.The person from the    
opposing side has to run and try to get
through your line.Everyone on your side
joins hands.If you get through you go  
back to your own side but if not you   
join the other team.The winning team is
the one which adds everyone from the   
other team to its own side.            </content>
