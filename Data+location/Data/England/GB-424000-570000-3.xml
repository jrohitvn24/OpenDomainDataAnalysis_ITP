		<content>The Northumberland Plate is run over   
two miles on the circular course.      
It is run on the last Saturday of Race 
Week,which is a holiday throughout the 
region.                                
  Racing in Newcastle started in 1621. 
One hundred and ten years later Thomas 
Smyles wrote down in his diary about a 
week of racing.The diary said that on  
June 12th he spent fifteen pounds,     
seventeen shillings and six pence.     
Most of the money was spent on drink.  
The people went to see racing first at 
Killingworth Moor,then it changed to   
the Town Moor and then they moved to   
Gosforth Park in 1881.There are 27 days
racing each year.Races are run under   
National Hunt rules in winter and on   
Flat in summer.Most race meetings last 
three days,and there are six races each
day.
