{Clifton}was mentioned in the Domesday 
 Book.Clifton was owned by King        
 Cnut.There was then a castle but now  
 in its place there is a house but it  
 is still called Clifton Castle.You can
 not call Clifton a village.It is      
 really an estate.

 a central area which is very          
 overgrown,rather marshy ,rough grazing
 land.The people use their goats to eat
 down this marshy green.
