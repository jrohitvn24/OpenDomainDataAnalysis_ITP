		<title>11THE LAKE</title>
		<content> Mr B was born in Abbots Bromley, and  
 except for 6 years during World War   
 Two has always lived here. He and his 
 wife lived where his grandson lives   
 now, and they had a shop - general    
 store - and he was a painter and      
 decorator. Fifteen years ago when new 
 houses were built behind his land he  
 had the lake made. It is fed by       
 springs so the water is pure and      
 clear. We saw the site of the village 
 pump (for that end of the village.)   
 Where the lake is now was just boggy  
 ground before. The site of the garden 
 is about 11/2 acres.The lake is       
 stocked with trout in two small ponds 
 are 160 trout and 60 more rainbow and 
  brown trout. There are a few American
  Brooks trout. The heron has been     
 coming to the lake and kingfisher     
  after the youngest fish. Many wild   
  flowers bloom around the lake.       </content>
