		<content>{YOUNGER VIEW}We like living in        
 Shotesham as it}peaceful. We are lucky
 to have such a pretty area for cycling
 and walking. People are so friendly,  
 we even have the use of a private     
 swimming pool and tennis court in the 
 summer. In the winter all the children
 toboggan down church hill. The        
 disadvantages are that there are few  
 children of one age group, so there is
 no youth club.                        
{OLDER VIEW}Shotesham is a pleasant    
 village in which to live.             
 Unfortunately with the closure of the 
 school and the village shop the       
 pattern of life has changed. On a walk
 through the village perhaps the only  
 signs of life are the passing cars and
 a tractor working in the fields. While
 we have our W.I., Wives' Group and    
 Over 60s club, there is very little   
 for the young people in the village.  </content>
