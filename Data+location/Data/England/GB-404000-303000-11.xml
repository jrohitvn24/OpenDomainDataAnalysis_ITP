		<title>11THE NEW MARKET: BROWNHILLS.</title>
		<content>   The new market opened on Tuesday    
 23rd April 1985. This is part of the  
 proposed development of Brownhills.   
   People interviewed generally        
 commented favourably. In particular   
 they preferred the new, flat tarmac   
 surface to the old mud one. This has  
 made it easier to walk through the    
 market. The new car park was also seen
 as an improvement, reducing congestion
 in the High Street. People showed     
 approval of the new layout and thought
 that it would bring more trade to     
 Brownhills.                           
   However, traders were more cautious.
 Some were pleased with their new      
 positions, eg. near an entrance, but  
 others were less happy. Many preferred
 not to express an opinion until they  
 were able to compare their sales over 
 a period of time.
