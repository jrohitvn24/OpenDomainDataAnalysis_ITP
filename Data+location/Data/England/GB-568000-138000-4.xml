		<title>04Employment in Horsmonden</title>
		<content>The shops in Horsmonden employ l9      
people most of them local.             
Boddingtons, the Plastics factory,     
employs ll5 and Louis Reece, a fruit   
distribution depot, employs l02.       
The Apple Growers Association employs  
33 and Heath Engineering 43 but many of
these are not Horsmonden villagers.    
Many people commute to London going by 
road to Paddock Wood and then by fast  
train, a journey of 50 minutes.  Some  
go by car or bus to Tunbridge Wells,   
Tonbridge or Maidstone.                
The traditional occupation of the area 
is farming particularly fruit and hops.
Orchards of cherries and apples        
abounded in the area but many have now 
been replaced by cereals.  The         
favourite Kentish apples are Cox's     
Orange Pippins and Bramleys.  Picked   
from September onwards these are famous
throughout the land.                   </content>
