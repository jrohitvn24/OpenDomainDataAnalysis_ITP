		<content> Cattle graze the fields in summer,    
 controlled by electric fences. In     
 winter they are housed in indoor      
 cubicles and are fed silage, grass and
 maize, supplemented with fodder beet  
 and concentrates. The dairy cows are  
 Friesians; some bred pure for         
 replacements, others bred to Hereford 
 Charolais, Limousin, Simmental or     
 Belgian Blue to produce calves for    
 beef. Most of the beef calves are     
 sold. Milk quotas introduced in 1984  
 are used to control output and have   
 resulted in fewer cows being kept and 
 less purchased concentrates being fed.
 Sheep live in the fields all year     
 round, except for a few days at       
 lambing time. Goat-keeping is         
 increasing in popularity. A few riding
 horses are kept for pleasure and      
 racing.
