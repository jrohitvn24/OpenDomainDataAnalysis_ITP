		<content> In recent years the farming scene has 
 changed considerably in our area.Most 
 of the small farms have been sold,the 
 farm houses being bought by           
 professional people who work in       
 Chesterfield,Sheffield or Matlock.The 
 farm land has been sold to other      
 farmers or to co-operatives.Of the    
 remaining working farms,the majority  
 are arable combined with fat-stock    
 rearing.There are a few dairy         
 farms,only one of which has a herd    
 producing Channel milk.Almost all the 
 land is well maintained with much     
 silage being made.Some corn is grown  
 but the small fields do not readily   
 lend themselves to large scale        
 production.Much hay is made,potatoes  
 crop well and there is a large area of
 meadowland.
