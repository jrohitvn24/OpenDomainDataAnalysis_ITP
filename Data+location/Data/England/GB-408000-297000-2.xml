		<title>02Four Oaks Employment.</title>
		<content> There is no large scale employer in   
 this residential district.What local  
 employmenmt there is is confined to   
 those service industries that are     
 necessary to maintain the fabric of   
 urban life.There is only one medium   
 sized factory which is associated with
 a major Birmingham manufacturer       
 connected with the car industry.In    
 keeping with current employment       
 trends,this firm is contracting its   
 activities.Redundancy and unemployment
 have had their effects and about 15%  
 of the workforce is unemployed. Many  
 school leavers have been unable to    
 find jobs.Most young people are       
 engaged on Youth Employment Schemes.  
 Some families struggle to maintain a  
 previous standard of living. Usually  
 unsuccessfully,once savings have been 
 used up. However many people          
 attempt to keep up appearances.       </content>
