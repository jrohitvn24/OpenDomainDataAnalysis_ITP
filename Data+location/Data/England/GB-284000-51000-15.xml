{   Dartmouth's Redundant Buildings.   
                                       
   Some future projects in Dartmouth   
 involve using some of its buildings   
 which are presently redundant.These   
 include the{Methodist Church          
 overlooking the Market Square which   
 may well be converted into an art and 
 craft centre, and the old{Fire Station
 next to the Flavel Hall will probably 
 become a sail loft.                   
   Much{debate}often occurs in the     
 local newspapers when buildings become
 available. The Fire Station was       
 discussed as a possible opportunity to
 resite the local library, or as a base
 for a playgroup or similar{community  
 enterprise.
