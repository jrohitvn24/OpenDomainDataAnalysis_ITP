		<title>19Observatory</title>
		<content> The Observatory stands on the edge    
 of Crosland Heath golf course. It was 
 completed in 1979 after four years of 
 work. The telescope can magnify up to 
 1200 times. Its dome is 15 feet in    
 diameter. When I looked through the   
 telescope I could see a church steeple
 that was miles away and could only    
 just be seen with the naked eye.      
   The telescope has a 40cm mirror.    
 When we went into the observatory we  
 had to wear plastic overshoes to stop 
 the dust getting onto the mirror. The 
 observatory is run by the             
 H.A.S.(Huddersfield astronomical      
 society). It will be used to track    
 Halley's Comet next year.
