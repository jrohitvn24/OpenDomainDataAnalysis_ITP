		<title>07Bradbourne Lakes</title>
		<content>Bradbourne Lakes consists of five      
lakes, some bigger than others.  On    
each lake there are many kinds of birds
for example Mallards,Greylag Geese,Mute
Swans,Moorhens and others.             
People go to the lakes for pleasure and
enjoyment.  Lots of small children go  
fishing with nets for tiny fish or they
feed the ducks and geese.  Many        
children also sail model boats.        
The lakes are man-made and were        
originally made for the Bradbourne     
Estate. The streams run into the head  
of the River Darenth.  The Bradbourne  
Lakes are split in two by Betenson     
Avenue Which runs through the middle of
them. There are many trees in the      
grounds including Oak,Chestnut,Horse   
Chestnut,Willow and several others.    
There are a few small man-made islands 
to help birds breed.
