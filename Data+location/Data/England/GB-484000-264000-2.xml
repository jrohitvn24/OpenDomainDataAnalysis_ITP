		<title>02 Houses in Wilby</title>
		<content> The oldest houses are large,usually   
built of{ stone} and stand in their own
grounds.They are mainly situated in the
centre of the village along the main   
road.On the eastern side is a long row 
of 19th century terraced houses built  
of{ red brick.} They have no front     
garden &amp; open directly onto the path.  
They once housed the families of farm  
labourers or people who worked in the  
shoe factories of Wellingborough.      
 Opposite are semi-detached houses and 
bungalows built in the 1920's &amp; 1930's.
They have large front gardens,{windows 
with bay-fronts} &amp; some have a{ pebble 
dashed front} which is typical of the  
period.Close to the roundabout is an   
estate of post-war council houses which
are mainly built of the same{ coloured 
brick} and are of the same design.
