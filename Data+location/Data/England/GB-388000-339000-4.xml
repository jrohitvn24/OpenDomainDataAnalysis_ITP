Next we crossed the road leading to Hem
Heath colliery and arrived at Magdalen 
Road, where we saw two public playing  
fields.                                
                                       
Near to the top of Magdalen Road we    
saw a public house. We then continued  
on our way and arrived back at school  
to sort out all the information we had 
collected.                             
                                       
My general impression of the area was  
that it was all very nice and pleasant 
and that there was nothing that        
spoiled the looks of everywhere else.  
The people I met were very nice to me  
and everyone we spoke to was keen to   
help us in our project.
