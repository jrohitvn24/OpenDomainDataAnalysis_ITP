		<title>15Popular childrens' games.</title>
		<content> The most popular games played in our  
 school playground are:                
                                       
{Runaround}is a race game played by two
 teams placed at opposite corners of   
 the playground.Each member runs       
 in turn all round the circuit back to 
 his team until the whole team has     
 finished.                             
{Bogeyman}is a skipping game with this 
 rhyme:"As I was in the kitchen doing a
 bit of stitching,In came the Bogeyman 
 and pushed me OUT".The child who was  
 skipping is then replaced by another  
 until everyone has had a turn.        
{Bulldog}is a fast game.The person who 
 is on,stands in the centre of the     
 playground and shouts "BULLDOG".All   
 the others try to run from one end of 
 the playgound to the other without    
 being touched by the Bulldog.The last 
 one "done" stands in the middle.      </content>
