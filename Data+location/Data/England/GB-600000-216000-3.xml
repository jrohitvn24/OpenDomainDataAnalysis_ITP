		<title>03FINGRINGHOE RANGES</title>
		<content> A large area of land near the river   
{Colne}is covered by{Fingringhoe       
{Ranges.}We went up a control tower    
 where we saw the sea, some fields and 
 some tractors cutting for silage.     
 There are quite a few drains because  
 the land slopes gently. Near South    
 House Farm the land is 50ft. People   
 cut the fields for silage and drain it
 so animals can graze. In the camp they
 bring up baby wild ducks (mallard)    
 from a day old until they are ready to
 fend for themselves. If a species of  
 bird has been depleted by a bad       
 winter,the camp superintendant rears  
 birds to top up stocks in the         
 wild.They work with the department of 
 the environment.The ranges there were 
 first built by the Americans after the
 war.The army still uses Fingringhoe   
 for a shooting range.
