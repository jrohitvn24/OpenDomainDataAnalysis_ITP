		<title>15SECRET M.O.D. ESTABLISHMENTS</title>
		<content>      Some of these establishments are 
 so secret, they  have been left off   
 some maps. One in our 'D' block does  
 research on deep sea diving and is so 
 secret that we wern't allowd in! - but
 one of our pupil's father works there.
 They used to disect and do not  very  
 nice things to goats,but all that has 
 now been stopped.                     
      These research establishments    
 have created a lot of jobs for both   
 the Navy and Civilians in the Gosport 
 area.  They have nearly all the up to 
 date machinery and plenty of space to 
 do all their work. If you  work in one
 of these places you have to sign a    
 special form called 'The Official     
 Secrets Act'.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
