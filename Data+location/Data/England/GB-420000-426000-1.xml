		<content> This block is part of the West        
 Yorkshire Conurbation.Birkenshaw,     
 Drighlington,Brownhill,Birstall,and   
 Gomersal form the perimeter.Six       
 A-roads criss-cross the area whilst   
 the M62 slashes what open countryside 
 there is in an E-W direction.         
 As foothills of the Pennine Range the 
 land is undulating,naturally moorland,
 but reclaimed in several areas for    
 agriculture-mainly market-gardening or
 stock-fattening.Disused pits and      
 railways are a feature of the area.   
 The original settlements are mainly   
 local stone;they owe their origins to 
 production,housing and services in the
 Woollen Industry.With the latters     
 demise,many of the mills have been    
 demolished or converted to light      
 industry.Conversely,stone housing is  
 being modernised and brick houses     
 added to form dormitory settlements.  </content>
