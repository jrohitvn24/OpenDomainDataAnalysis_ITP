{Mr.and Mrs. Lesley Bates own and run a
{thriving upholstery business in the   
{village of South Wingfield.}          
 Eight years ago they rented a disused 
 coach-house to start their business.  
 They have re-upholstered many types of
 furniture for local people including  
 three-piece suites and bar seats for  
 public houses. Mr.Bates enjoys        
 restoring antique furniture.          
 Some of their more unusual jobs have  
 included an order from the village    
 undertaker to make a cover for a      
 coffin and one from a local farmer to 
 re-upholster the inside of a gig so   
 that it could be used for transporting
 brides and grooms at local weddings.
