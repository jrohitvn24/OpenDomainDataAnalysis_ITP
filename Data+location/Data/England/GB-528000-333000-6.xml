		<title>06CHANCE TO SHARE</title>
		<content> The school is situated in Park Avenue,
 Sutterton.It is a combination of four 
 village schools which were closed in  
 1978.(Algarkirk,Fosdyke,Wigtoft and   
 Sutterton).The new school opened on   
 April 10th,1978.The school was        
 originally intended to be a Middle    
 School but Comprehensive education was
 not implemented and so the school is  
 not large enough,and the top class    
 have a mobile classroom.              
 The school is unique in that it has a 
 chance to share.This means that the   
 community has paid for part of the    
 facilities of the school (they have   
 just built a new lounge and kitchen on
 the site of the old school kitchen),  
 and they can use the school in and out
 of school hours.School meals were     
 abolished in Primary Schools on       
 27/3/81.The Head Teacher,Mr.D.Steel   
 liaises closely with the community.   </content>
