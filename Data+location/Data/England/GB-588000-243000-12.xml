		<title>12Gt.Waldingfield V.C.P School</title>
		<content>  The school was built in 1970 by      
Kingsbury Builders from Boxford.There  
are no classrooms with doors,but       
teaching areas.This is called an Open  
Plan.There are 4 teachers and about 100
children from 5-9 years old.We have a  
secretary who comes in mornings only.  
She also runs the Watch club.We have 2 
cooks and 2 helpers when we have       
dinner.About half of the children stay 
for dinner and most of the others stay 
for packed lunch.The school has a hall 
where we have assembly,P.E.and         
singing.There are 2 quiet rooms and in 
the grounds there is quite a large     
pond.There is a fence round the school.
