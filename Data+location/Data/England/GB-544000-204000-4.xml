		<title>04TAKELEYS FRUIT FARM</title>
		<content> Takeleys farm on the outskirts of     
 Epping Upland is a fairly small farm  
 by local standards and has developed  
 since 1978 as a fruit and vegetable   
 farm.Over the last 20 years labour for
 fruit picking has become harder to    
 find:the roving casual workers are    
 fewer and find it hard to avoid tax on
 their earnings.Takeleys has instead   
 encouraged people to pick their own   
 fruit and vegetables,paying much lower
 prices for fresher food for their     
 freezers.90% of their produce is sold 
 this way:only 10% are picked and sent 
 to market.                            
 Fruit grown include strawberries and  
 raspberries, while vegetables grown   
 include peas,broad beans, french      
 beans and courgettes.
