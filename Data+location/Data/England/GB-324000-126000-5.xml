		<title>05THE SAWMILL-A LOCAL INDUSTRY</title>
		<content>  Walford Caravans and a caravan park  
 are a tribute to the tourist industry;
 Bigwood agricultural suppliers shows  
 the large farming concern;other firms 
 reflect the area's potential.         
  Taunton Sawmills is an example of a  
 local industry.10 people,9 men and one
 lady,work there.The sawmill is 8 years
 old and its machinery is run entirely 
 by electricity.Douglas fir,spruce and 
 pine are used.All the prepared timber 
 is used to make fencing.No timber is  
 wasted because the sawdust goes to a  
 farmer for his cattle's bedding, other
 waste to a factory at South Moulton to
 be made into chipboard. Lorries bring 
 16 tonnes of wood a day.The men work  
 five days a week.The saws used to cut 
 the timber are sharpened every day.One
 union rule is to wear earphones in    
 order to prevent deafness,caused by   
 the high volume of noise in the mill. </content>
