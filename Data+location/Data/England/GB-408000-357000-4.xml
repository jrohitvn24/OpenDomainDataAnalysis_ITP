		<title>04History of Warslow Schools</title>
		<content>     Warslow Primary School used to be 
housed in the school building opposite 
the church on the main road.  In 1979  
the Middle School and First Schools    
were formed, the Middle School moving  
into the former Secondary School       
building and the First School remaining
in the old building.  A year later the 
First School joined the Middle School  
in their present building.             
     In September 1983 Staffordshire   
Education Committee announced that they
wanted to close the Middle School to   
save money.  They suggested that the   
children should transfer to a Leek     
school, 8 miles away.  An Action Group 
was formed and several members went to 
see the Minister for Education, to put 
forward their point of view.  He       
decided that the school should remain  
open because of the long distance the  
children would have had to travel.     </content>
