		<title>01DERWENT VALLEY - GENERAL</title>
		<content>    The D-block rural area lies in the 
 heart of the beautiful Derwent Valley,
 part in Tyne &amp; Wear and part in county
 Durham. At Lintzford the valley opens 
 out into a wide, circular, tree shaded
 ampitheatre of level land and is a    
 convenient place from which to visit  
 the nearby Chopwell Woodlands.        
    In the area, but not open to the   
 public, is Hamsterley Hall which holds
 excellent specimens of ancient swords 
 of the Shotley Bridge German sword    
 makers.                               
     The countryside was once dotted   
 with coalmines which are now closed.  
 Employment includes farming, forestry,
 inkworks, light engineering,          
 horticulture, with a few services in  
 garages, shops, inns, riding stables  
 and tourism. There is one main road   
 and the Derwent Walk Country Park.
