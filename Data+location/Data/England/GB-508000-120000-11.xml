		<content>  The few Nurseries in the area all lie
 along B.2133, on Lower Greensand soil,
 which is rich, light and workable.    
 There are glasshouses for ornamentals 
 near Adversane, and a few acres of    
 soft-fruit at Broadford Bridge. To the
 east is a 15-acre garden centre for   
 conifers and roses, with a nursery of 
 ornamental fish and aquatic plants.   
   Changes are occurring. Dairy farmers
 have been adversely affected by milk  
 quotas; a few have had to sell up and 
 others may do so. The pig farmers feel
 forgotten by Government and the E.E.C.
 Nurseries face unfair competition from
 continental growers, whose fuel costs 
 are subsidised.  Now farmers growing  
 wheat and barley are concerned with   
 stock-piling.  Several farmers stated,
 without being asked, that they are now
 against the EEC, and will vote against
 the Government at the next election.  </content>
