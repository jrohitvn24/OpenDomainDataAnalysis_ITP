 Ashford has always been an important  
 'railway' town.   It has two routes   
 cutting across our survey area.       
                                       
 Line one cuts through the village  of 
 Sevington and is on the main route    
 from London to the Channel Ports of   
 Dover and Folkestone.   This line is  
 very busy with through Port Traffic   
 and also has two trains per hour at   
 normal times with extra during 'rush' 
 hour times for the commuter traffic,  
 London being 1 hour, by fast train,   
 away.   Line two is based on the      
 Ashford/Hastings route and almost     
 bisects the 'Block' in two.           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
