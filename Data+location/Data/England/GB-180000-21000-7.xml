 Myghal Josef was St. Keverne's        
 blacksmith, a man of great force and  
 courage.  In 1497 he led a protest    
 against taxation levied by the King   
 for his war against the Scots.        
 Myghal, know as An Gof with Thomas    
 Flamank marched without horses        
 gathering an army of supporters on the
 way to Blackheath where he engaged the
 King's army in battle.  Following the 
 King's treachery when An Gof was      
 tricked into a parley he was captured 
 and later hung drawn and quartered at 
 Tyburn. An Gof said of himself that he
 would "Hack a name perpetual and a    
 fame permanent and immortal" He was   
 right. His memorial was unveiled in   
 1966. Each year there is a ceremony   
 led by Cornish Bards alongside the    
 churchyard where a slate slab         
 commemorates his noble stand.         </content>
