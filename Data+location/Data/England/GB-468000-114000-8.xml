 My garden is 47 strides long and 37   
 strides wide.My garden is for playing 
 and growing. We grow flowers and      
 vegetables. We've got half an acre.Our
 garden looks like its in two bits, but
 its not.One bit of the garden has got 
 all the flowers in it and one bit has 
 our play things. I play on my bike and
 I play ball. I can run in my garden. I
 play with dolls in my garden too.
