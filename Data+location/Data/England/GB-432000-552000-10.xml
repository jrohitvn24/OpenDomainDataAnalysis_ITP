		<content>   The deep coal mine at{Herrington    
{Colliery}is one of the last remaining 
 Pits on the exposed sections of the   
{Durham Coalfield.}Mining is still one 
 of the main employers in this area and
 the threatened closure of Herrington  
 Pit could have a devastating effect   
 on our small communities.             
   The pit heap tends to dominate the  
 small village of New Herrington and   
 from near-by Penshaw Hill the pit and 
 village are lost in the vast black    
 mass of coal spoil.                   
   The neat and tidy rows of{terraced  
{houses,}Lanton Sreet, Fletcher Terrace
 and Railway Terrace flank the road    
 that leads to the pit shaft and its   
 towering winding wheel. It was for    
 this pit and the community that the   
 people of this area have just         
 undergone twelve months of striking   
 hardship.                             </content>
