		<title>05NEW HALL FARM</title>
		<content> My Grandad Mr.Smith owns this farm.   
 My Dad works the farm and drives the  
 combine harvester in the summer.  We  
 have 9 ducks and I collect the eggs.  
 Uncle David has the two nice farm dogs
 Silver and Pup.  We grow apples,      
 damsons, plums and gooseberries.  We  
 grow red and white potatoes,          
 cauliflowers and cabbage.  We have 8  
 wild cats.  The mother cat's name is  
 Wonder.                               
 Dad says we might get some pigs to eat
 up the last of the potatoes.  Grandad 
 works on the farm as well.  He saws up
 the wood to make boxes for the        
 cabbages and cauliflowers.  Uncle     
 David takes them to London in his     
 lorry nearly every night.             
 He takes one of the dogs with him.    
 They both have turns riding to market.
