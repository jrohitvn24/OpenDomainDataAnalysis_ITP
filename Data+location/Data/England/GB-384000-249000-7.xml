		<content>    The school is made up of two       
 different buildings. These are the    
 infant and the junior departments.    
   The infant rooms were built around  
 1965 and comprise two classrooms and a
 music room which is also used by the  
 juniors.                              
  The junior department was built in   
 1981. When the junior department      
 opened,it replaced the old school     
 which had been built around 1869. The 
 old school is now the village centre. 
  There are six rooms in the junior    
 department and these are divided among
 the three 'units' of which 'unit 1' is
 for the oldest children and 'unit 3'  
 is for the youngest.                  
   There is an assembly hall which is  
 also used as a dining room and a      
 gymnasium. There is also a library, an
 office and staff rooms all of which   
 are used by the whole school.         </content>
