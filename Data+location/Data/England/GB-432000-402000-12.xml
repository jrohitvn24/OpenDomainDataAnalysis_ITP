		<title>12CHANGES IN WORSBROUGH</title>
		<content>{Mr Elmhirst}earned his living by      
 becoming a lawyer. During World War 2 
 he became an ARP Warden. As he was    
 walking through Worsbrough he was     
 shocked at the{state of peoples houses
 and the way they lived. He decided to 
 do something about this. He went      
 into local politics and he became a   
 councillor. Worsbrough Council then   
 began a programme of house            
 improvement.New council houses were   
 built and many of the old back to     
 back houses were pulled down. Mr      
 Elmhirst became interested in         
{education}of the children of          
 Worsbrough. He remembers his own      
 school days at{Winchester}and was     
 concerned that children in Worsbrough 
 should have similar facilities in     
 their own area. He became a{governor  
 of several local schools to try to    
 bring about improvement in education. </content>
