		<content> Winter is the busiest time of the year
 at{St Sampson's harbour}. The biggest 
 ship to use the harbour is a 260 foot 
 long tanker.There are two parts of the
 harbour, the north and the south side.
 The{north side}has 6 berths where they
 unload sand,coal and timber . On the  
 Northside they also unload heavy oil  
 which goes by underground pipeline    
 straight to the Power Station.At      
{Southside}there are 4 berths where    
 oil,petrol and gas are unloaded.Cement
 is unloaded into silos from the boat  
 Ronez.Other ships bring in bricks,    
 fertiliser and lager from Holland.    
 There has been a{safety wall}built at 
 the harbour where the fuel and gas is 
 unloaded in case of any leaks which   
 may cause an explosion or fire.       
 Recently a pipe carrying heavy oil to 
 the Power Station cracked,{polluting  
 the Harbour with oil.                 </content>
