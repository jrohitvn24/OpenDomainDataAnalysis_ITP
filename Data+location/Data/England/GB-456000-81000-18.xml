		<content> We are lucky because we have many ways
 in which we can spend our leisure     
 time. A lot of it is spent on the     
 beach and on the seafront. There are  
 two piers in our area, Shanklin and   
 Sandown.                              
 On each there is a theatre where      
 people go to watch the shows and have 
 a drink. There are shops on the piers 
 which sell sweets and souvenirs. The  
 arcades and the slot machines there   
 are very popular.                     
 Many people in ln our area paricipate 
 in fishing activities of some kind.   
 Further inland we have two Leisure    
 centres. Sandown Leisure centre has   
 two swimming pools ,squash courts,    
 cafeteria, sunbeds, and a sauna.At    
 South Wight Sports Centre you can play
 badminton, cricket,tennis, gymnastics 
 and many more activities. We have     
 youth clubs and a cinema.             </content>
