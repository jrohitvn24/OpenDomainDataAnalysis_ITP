		<title>01Overview of Kirkby</title>
		<content> Kirkby (Cherchebi) lies at the north  
 end of the Metropolitan Borough of    
 Knowsley and has a population of      
 approximately 50,000. A number are    
 employed in companies located in      
 Knowsley Industrial Park but many,    
 regrettably are unemployed due to     
 migration from the area by a large    
 number of firms.                      
 Kirkby is an area blessed with many   
 amenities, for example a sports       
 centre, Olympic sized swimming pool, a
 large library and modern town centre  
 with an open air market close by. It  
 is well served with public transport  
 and is ideally situated for access to 
 the motorway system.                  
 Most of the housing and the schools   
 (which are well supported by the      
 authority) have been built during the 
 last 30 years. The area is fortunate  
 also in the public space available.   </content>
