		<content> This area is one of the larger and    
 more sparsely populated localities in 
 the Bradford Metropolitan District,   
 having 15,567 people. Outside the two 
 main residential centres, the area is 
 mainly agricultural land reaching a   
 height of 1,300 feet. The farming land
 has many small groups of houses which 
 are well known for their unusual names
 viz: Moscow, Egypt, Jerusalem, Worlds 
 End.                                  
 The village of Thornton was formally  
 an important textile centre but is now
 mainly residential. It was the        
 birthplace of the Bronte sisters and  
 their father was the village curate.  
 The other main residential suburb,    
 Allerton, was formerly a substantial  
 village but has since been extended by
 a large Local Council Housing Estate.
