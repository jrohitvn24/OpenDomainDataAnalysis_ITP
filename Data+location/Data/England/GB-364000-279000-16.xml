		<title>16DIALECT. SOUTH SHROPSHIRE.</title>
		<content>{The dialect}of the area is colourful  
 and pleasant to hear. It is mainly    
 heard among the older generation who  
 have lived here all their lives and it
 seems to be particularly pronounced in
 the male voice.                       
{Examples:- }"It were white-over this  
 morning, but it inna too cold now. By 
 middle-day I shouldna be surprised if 
 it's raining. This daggly weather- ooh
 it dunna please the bees."            
    "D'ye know, down the lane where my 
 lad live, it's a whole topcoat        
 warmer."                              
    "You hanna tasted tea from our     
 water have ye? We allus use the well  
 water for driking"                    
    "I inna gunna cos I dunna wanna"
