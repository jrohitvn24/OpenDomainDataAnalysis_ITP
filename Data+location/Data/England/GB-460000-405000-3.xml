		<title>03Changes in Long Sandall.</title>
		<content>{Long Sandall}was mentioned in the     
 Domesday Book. It was owned by Earl   
 Tosti. He lived in the Great Manor    
 House of Hexthorpe. Long Sandall was  
 later a peaceful village - a rural    
 community. In{1851}there were one     
 hundred and forty one people living   
 there. There were thirty-one houses.  
 Most of the families were large. The  
 main jobs were canal workers, railway 
 workers and farming.                  
                                       
 Today, the village is dying. Many of  
 the houses are boarded up and are     
 going to be knocked down. Even though 
 there are about seven houses still    
 standing there are only two families  
 that remain.
