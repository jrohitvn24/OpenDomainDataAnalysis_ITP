		<title>03EAST WITTERING VILLAGE</title>
		<content> East Wittering is a coastal village   
 situated on the South coast of        
 England.It is seven miles South of the
 city of Chichester,which is the county
 town of West Sussex.East Wittering is 
 set on a flat,low plain surrounded on 
 all sides by agricultural land,except 
 by sea to the South.This flat plain   
 stretches eight miles inland,where    
 the South Downs begin.Their presence  
 can have a marked effect upon local   
 weather patterns.For instance,the     
 movement of seasonal thunder storms   
 further inland can be temporarily     
 halted by this range of hills.        
   Before the motor car was invented   
 only 180 people lived in the          
 village but today there are about     
 2,000 inhabitants.During the summer   
 months with the arrival of the holiday
 makers this increases to approximately
 8,000 people.                         </content>
