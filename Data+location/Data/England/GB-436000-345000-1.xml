  Ours is a mixture of farmland,       
  housing, together with spoil_heaps   
  from earlier coal_mining operations  
  and criss_crossed by roads. The chief
  of these roads is a fairly new dual  
  carriageway the oldest being part of 
  the Roman road known as Ryknield     
  Road. The land is naturally          
  undulating, the spoil_heaps and      
  cuttings and embankments reinforcing 
  this aspect of the area's appearence,
  whilst the North_South ridge on the  
  west side of the area separates it   
  from the Derwent Vally and the town  
  of Belper(pop. 17000). Most housing  
  development is along the lines of the
  chief roads, Kilburn being the       
  largest of the villages in the area, 
  others being Denby, Openwoodgate,    
  most of Holbrook and part of Horsley 
  Woodhouse.                           </content>
