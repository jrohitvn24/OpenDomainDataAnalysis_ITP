		<title>20TRANSPORT IN S.CROYDON</title>
		<content>                                       
 Due to the hilly nature of the area,  
 and the fact that there are large     
 expanses of woodland and open         
 space,there is an unequal distribution
 of transport facilities throughout    
 S.Croydon.                            
 The main valley runs N _ S and is used
 by the old A23 and main railway line  
 to the south coast.No other railway   
 runs through the Block.Bus routes are 
 very largely limited to the west,as   
 there are few roads which cut across  
 from E _ W.
