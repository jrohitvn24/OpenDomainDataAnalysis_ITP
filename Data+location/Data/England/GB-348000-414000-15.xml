		<title>15Life For an Old Lady</title>
		<content>     Mrs Marsden was born in Eccleston 
in 1899. She lives in one of a number  
of bungalows specially built for old   
people. She likes the bungalow very    
much. She lives alone.                 
     Because of asthma she doesn't     
go on holiday, but every Sunday she    
travels by bus to visit her daughter   
who lives in Heskin, the next village. 
Her other daughter lives in Eccleston. 
     Mrs Marsden does her own shopping 
and  cooking, but a home-help from     
Social Services visits her for two     
hours every week.                      
     She spends most of her time       
reading, using a magnifying-glass, or  
watching television. She used to knit, 
but is now unable to see well enough.  
She used to attend the Over-Sixties    
Club, but no longer feels sufficiently 
fit to do so.
