		<title>06TIMSBURY GROUPS</title>
		<content> We asked the people of Timsbury about 
 any groups or associations they       
 belonged to.Our survey took place mid 
 morning on a Monday.Most people that  
 we interviewed did belong to one.The  
 people we interviewed were mostly     
 ladies and only a few men.            
     Most seemed more interested in    
 plants and animals than in humans.Not 
 many people had to wear a             
 uniform.Most people's clubs were for  
 fun,but educational activities were   
 not far behind in popularity.People   
 went to their clubs weekly or monthly.
 Twice weekly was more rare.Everyone   
 had to pay about Â£2 to Â£4             
 subscription per year for their       
 groups.This was usually paid in weekly
 amounts.
