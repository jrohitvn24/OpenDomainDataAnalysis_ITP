		<content>    Most of the houses in Oldbury range
 from about 100-600 years old.  They   
 are mostly made of stone and are farms
 or cottages, though there is a small  
 council estate.                       
    From the population of about 700 we
 worked out that there is about 150    
 properties.  Not many houses are sold 
 or built but when they are sold they  
 are very expensive ranging from       
 Â£50,000-Â£250,000.  Because of this not
 many people with young families move  
 into the village.  This could         
 eventually affect the school          
 numbers.  The gardens are mostly      
 large.  They have to be neat and tidy 
 as the village enters the Best Kept   
 Village competition.  Many people keep
 animals on small holdings.
