		<content> Boshaw Whams Reservoir is at Hade     
 Edge.It was not built for drinking    
 water but to supply water to the mills
 nearby.They now use the reservoir for 
{sailing and fishing.}Recently the rent
 for the Yorkshire Water Authority went
 up from Â£12 per year to Â£900.Each     
 angling member can only get two fish  
 per visit which must be at least 12"  
 in length.500 trout are put in the    
 reservoir every month during the      
 fishing season.The angling club was   
 opened 99 years ago and only 75 people
 are allowed to join.It costs Â£50 to   
 join and Â£50 per year.You are allowed 
 to use bait or you can fly-fish,but   
 you are not allowed to fish in boats  
 or swim in the reservoir.On the same  
 water is a sailing club which opened  
 in 1959.In this club there are about  
 200 sailing members,but only 50       
 members can have boats.               </content>
