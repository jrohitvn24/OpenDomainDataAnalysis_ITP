		<title>17PALLINGHAM MANOR FARM</title>
		<content>  This 450 acre farm is the only part  
 of the area in the parish of          
 Wisborough Green. Half the land is    
 arable, growing winter wheat and      
 barley; and half is used for rearing  
 a beef herd of Friesian cattle with a 
 few Hereford and Angus breeds.        
  The oldest building, Chapel Barn, is 
 12th century and is scheduled as an   
 ancient monument. It is believed to be
 part of the original residence.       
  The present farmhouse is 16th century
 and includes "Pulborough" and         
 "Washington" stone. The farmhouse and 
 many of the late 18th century wooden  
 barns are listed as buildings of      
 national importance. Over the last 14 
 years, the owners have carried out    
 careful restoration of house,barns and
 outbuildings.                         
  This restoration earned them the West
 Sussex C.C. Conservation Award in 1978</content>
