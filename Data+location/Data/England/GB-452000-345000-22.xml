<content>

&lt;br />&lt;br />The films being watched today are Senna, Bad Teacher, Bridesmaids, Diary of a Wimpy kid(Roderick Rules), Green Lantern,  Hangover Part 2, Kung Fu Panda 2, Xmen Firstclass,Pirates of the Caribbean, Stranger tides and the Merry Wives of Windsor. As of 2011 Top grossing of all time in the UK is Avatar. A pirate of the Caribbean is the top 10 highest grossing film.   &lt;br />&lt;br />Today me and my partner Chrystal did a tally chart to see who liked what film. Paul was the highest film to be rated 10, 2nd was diary of a wimpy kid 2, 3rd was wild child and are we there yet? and last but not least Kung Fu Panda 2, Pirates of the Caribbean Stranger tides ,Rio , Tangled and Avatar. &lt;br />&lt;br />3D Films&lt;br />&lt;br />A 3D film ticket for an Adult costs Normal ticket price + £2.10 and a child costs Normal ticket price + £1.50 then 80p for 3D glasses. A 3D film is a film that looks like it comes out of the screen at you.&lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
