		<title>03HOUSING AT BURLEY WOODHEAD.</title>
		<content> Nearly all the houses have a very     
 interesting history behind them.      
  {Burley Woodhead}was once said to    
 have been as industrialised as        
{Bradford.}                            
 For there were once four mills in the 
 area,these were a spinning mill off   
{Green Lane,}the middle mill,{Myrtle   
{Grove mill}and{Hargreaves mill}later  
 called{Rombalds Moor Bleach mill.}    
 Hardly any of these mills still exist.
 Many of them have been pulled down and
 turned into houses.                   
   One of these houses is{The Glen,}   
 which was once{Myrtle Grove Mill. }   
 It was knocked down and two houses    
 were made from the stone.             
 There was once an old Chapel which has
 now been made into a house and is     
 called{Chapel Fold.}
