		<title>13SAWMILL, WINDSOR ESTATE.</title>
		<content>   We visited the{Forest}and{Sawmill}  
 which both belong to the Crown        
 Estates.  Most of the timber used     
 comes from the{Windsor Estate,}which  
 is the biggest and most valuable of   
 the Crown Estates.                    
                                       
   The{forest,}which was planted in    
 1936,is principally of Scots Pine     
 trees.  These grow well in the acid,  
 sandy soils. The trees take 60 years  
 to grow and are planted at a density  
 of 260 trees per hectare.  They are   
 thinned after the first twenty years  
 to encourage vigorous growth and      
 afterwards thinned every five years.  
                                       
   The{Swinley Park Sawmill} was built 
 in 1979 and the buildings on the site 
 are used mainly for storage.  Some of 
 the planks and posts are also stored  
 outside.                              </content>
