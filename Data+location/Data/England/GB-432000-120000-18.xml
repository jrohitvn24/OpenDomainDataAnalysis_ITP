		<title>18ROMSEY POST OFFICE</title>
		<content> Romsey Post Office is quite small, but
 is still busy.  When you enter, there 
 is usually a queue and the place feels
 like a church quiet, still and slow.  
 The walls of the Post Office are      
 covered with little leaflets telling  
 you train times and about pensions.   
 Behind the counters the people seem   
 very serious and quiet.  When letters 
 come in they are split up into        
 districts, then streets then house    
 numbers.  Roughly 158,000 letters and 
 1,000 parcels come in every week.     
 Behind the scenes it feels very sleepy
 and dusty but also friendly.  The     
 Romsey Post Office does not use a     
 computer but it uses the Post Code as 
 a type of computer.  Already some     
 businesses are using computers to     
 communicate with each other and maybe 
 in the future this will be more widely
 used.                                 </content>
