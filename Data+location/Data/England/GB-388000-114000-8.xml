		<title>08FARMING IN STUBHAMPTON AREA</title>
		<content>    The area under cultivation has     
 been increasing for some years, and is
 still increasing as copses are cleared
 and downland ploughed. The principal  
 crops are wheat and barley, with some 
 turnips, sweetcorn and kale.          
   Organic farming occurs in only one  
 location where woodland is being      
 replaced by organic wheat, to provide 
 the long straw needed for thatching.  
    The cattle grazed on the grassland 
 are predominantly Friesian dairy cows 
 with their calves, but there is one   
 herd of Guernseys. There is also a    
 beef herd of cross-bred Charolais.    
    Sheep were once very numerous on   
 the downland, but then largely        
 disappeared. Recently, however, they  
 have returned to some extent. Many of 
 the ewes are cross-breeds noted for   
 producing a large number of lambs     
 with a good growth rate.              </content>
