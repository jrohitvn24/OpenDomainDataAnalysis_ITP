		<title>09THE VILLAGE BAKERY, FAIR OAK</title>
		<content>    The Oven Door Bakery opened 13     
 years ago to bring "real" bread to the
 village of Fair Oak.                  
    The day for the baker and his staff
 of seven begins at 4a.m. and finishes 
 after cleaning up at about 6p.m.      
    First task is the preparation of   
 morning-goods - bread, rolls etc. Then
 follows throughout the day an endless 
 succession of doughnuts,scones and    
 cakes both large and small; fruit     
 flans in summer and Christmas cakes   
 later.                                
    In all, 8 varieties of loaf are    
 made and in a typical week, well over 
 a hundred and fifty dozen loaves are  
 baked.                                
    In addition, a large selection of  
 pizzas,filled rolls and quiches supply
 the midday needs of pupils from the   
 local school and the requirements of  
 the baker's many regular customers.   </content>
