		<title>09RECREATION - DERWENT VALLEY</title>
		<content> New flora would help to stimulate     
 interest and study.                   
    Individuals and organised groups   
 use the Walk for exercise and         
 sponsored functions for charitable    
 funds, whilst the horse riding school 
 at Hagg Farm on the A694 road, and    
 others, often use the route. Several  
 public footpaths cross over and under 
 the Walk opening up the adjacent woods
 and fields whilst the viaducts give   
 excellent views over the surrounding  
 countryside and the housing           
 development at Hamsterley Mill and    
 Parklands.                            
   On the site of the original Lintz   
 Green Station, the station master's   
 house and railway workers' cottages   
 are now private residences. Here the  
 River Derwent and the Walk are very   
 close only 135 almost vertical feet   
 separate them at one point.           </content>
