		<title>13St.Mary's Estate - Haywood</title>
		<content>                                       
Little Haywood is dominated by a modern
estate of houses they are built on the 
former Manor Farm and part of the      
St.Mary's Abbey land.(Convent)         
The development was planned to create a
village atmosphere.All houses built    
were detached until recently, when at  
the request of the Parish Council some 
semi detached houses were included. The
400 houses have trees planted by the   
builders and a larged grassed open     
space for play is somewhere near the   
centre. This is in the position of a   
former pond. There are no shops in     
the estate, although they were planned 
along with a new Pub.
