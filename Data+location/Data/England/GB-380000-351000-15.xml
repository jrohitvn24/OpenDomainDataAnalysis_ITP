		<title>15Normid Hypermarket Talke</title>
		<content>In 1975 Normid Cooperative Society     
opened a giant hypermarket on part of  
the site of the old colliery.It is an  
enormous store selling groceries like  
an ordinary supermarket,and also       
furniture,gardening equipment,D.I.Y    
products,magazines and books,clothes   
and electrical goods.There is also a   
filling station with nine petrol pumps.
It used to have an area outside where  
second hand cars were sold but this    
closed down after a while.Now they are 
building a car wash.Most shoppers      
travel to Normid in their cars and so  
the store has a carpark for over one   
thousand cars.At Christmas time this   
can be full.Normid employs 300 people. 
It is open every day except Sunday.When
they are all working it has 26         
check outs.At Christmas time the store 
manager lets our school stand outside  
the store entrance and sing carols.    </content>
