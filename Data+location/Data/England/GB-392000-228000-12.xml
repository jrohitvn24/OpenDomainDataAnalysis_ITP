		<content>       The survey area is constantly   
 under pressure for the development of 
 new housing. The villages are becoming
 increasingly popular to live in, and  
 the Green Belt surrounding Cheltenham 
 has resulted in houses having to be   
 built further away. Very few building 
 developments are permitted within the 
 Green Belt. The present Government has
 tried (so far unsuccessfully)to relax 
 the regulations concerning Green      
 Belts. New houses tend to be of the   
 larger and more expensive 'four       
 bedroomed detached' type and on       
 average cost more than Â£60,000 to     
 buy. Some modern houses in            
 Gotherington have recently been sold  
 for more than Â£80,000 each. Older     
 propertites, those                    
 considered of 'character' and built of
 traditional Cotswold stone are        
 especially popular.                   </content>
