		<title>10THE QUEEN'S REGIMENT(CONT)</title>
		<content> Cooks from the catering corps are also
 expected to shoot and pass infantry   
 tests but are mainly involved in      
 providing meals to fit in with        
 soldiers' shifts.  According to the   
 training sergeant the most important  
 aspect of training is the teaching of 
 tactical awareness, fitness and       
 shooting.  Apart from running, some   
 soldiers participate in martial       
 arts.During training live ammunition  
 is used but every precaution is taken 
 for the soldiers's safety.            
 During the Falkland's Crisis          
 non-combattant soldiers took part in  
 additional survival training in case  
 they were needed.  Recently the       
 Regiment took part in Operation       
 Lionheart, a NATO military            
 exercice.Further training has taken   
 place in Cyprus, Canada and Belize.The
 next posting is to Northern Ireland.  </content>
