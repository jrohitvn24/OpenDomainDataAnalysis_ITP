		<content> Old style orchards with{standard trees
 are rapidly disappearing and being    
 replaced by densely planted dwarf     
 trees for main cider producer{Bulmers,
 in Hereford.Still a few independent   
 producers.Eating and cooking apples   
 mainly grown by house owners as very  
 few farms now have old style orchards.
 In autumn common sight on roads is a  
 tractor pulling trailer load of cider 
 fruit for processing in Hereford.A    
 quota system is operated by Bulmers,  
 the worlds largest cider makers,which 
 entails the farmer delivering a set   
 amount of fruit on an exact day and   
 time.Highest prices are paid for      
 preferred varieties e.g{White Norman. 
{'Yaffles'- Green woodpeckers,}Bulmers 
 trade mark, are less common in the    
 area due to lack of big apple trees   
 and effects of{Dutch Elm}disease.
