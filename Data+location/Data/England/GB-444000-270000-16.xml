arable and pastoral farming.The farms  
are quite small with a few employees , 
earning an average $90 week.Some own   
their farms of about 100 acres while   
others rent them from Warwickshire     
County Council.Fertilisers ,natural    
and manmade ,cost about $135           
year.Equipment used includes tractors  
ploughs bailers and harvesters. Only   
some potatoes and vegetables are sold  
locally .Most popular crops include    
potatoes,grass,fodder,barley,and beet. 
There are dairy cows and dairy         
fallowers. They also have family pets, 
usually cats and dogs.                 
Technology in the area is mainly in the
home. Many people had a television     
video telephone and many kitchen       
gadgets. People use these for saving
