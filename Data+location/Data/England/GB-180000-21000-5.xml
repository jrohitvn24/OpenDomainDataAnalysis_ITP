 St. Keverne School was opened in      
 1877 and occupied one building        
 which is now the Infant section. In   
 1969 a new building was opened for the
 Junior pupils and the whole school    
 now accommodates 91 children. It is   
 the largest Primary School on the     
 Lizard Peninsula with 5 teachers, 4   
 of whom are full time.  The first     
 headmaster was Mr Thomas Pengelly     
 (meaning head of copse in Cornish!) It
 has an outdoor swimming pool, 10.5    
 metres long and a large hall/gym. The 
 original school is built of granite   
 and has a new slate roof.  The Junior 
 school is constructed of block with   
 a large flat and leaky roof.          
 There is a kitchen, headmaster's      
 office and two classrooms. The school 
 is fortunate in having an extensive   
 outdoor play area.                    </content>
