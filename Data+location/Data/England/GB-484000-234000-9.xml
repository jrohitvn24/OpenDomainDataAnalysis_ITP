		<title>09Youth Clubs in Bletchley</title>
		<content>   A Youth Club is where teenagers go  
 to enjoy themselves in the evening.At 
 the one I go to the age group is from 
 10-16 years.The Youth Club is open on 
 Wednesdays from 7-10 O'clock.It costs 
 30p to get in if it is a disco and if 
 it is a games night it's 20p (that's  
 only if you have got a membership card
 which costs 50p).Every three weeks    
 there is a disco but the problem is   
 that the boys don't like the disco    
 because only the girls dance.         
   On ordinary nights there are games  
 put out to play like putting,snooker, 
 darts,table football and table tennis.
 There is also a tuck shop which sells 
 sweets and drink.                     
   The Youth Club is very popular and  
 lots of teenagers enjoy it and go     
 regularly.
