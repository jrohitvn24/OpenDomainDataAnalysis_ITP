		<content>   There are 2 Cub Scout Packs,a Scout 
 Troop,a mixed Venture Unit and a Girl 
 Guide Company who meet in what must be
 one of the most suitable and          
 attractive purpose built Headquarters 
 in the country.There is a Brownie Pack
 which at the moment meets in the      
 School hall but is shortly to join the
 other groups.The whole Group is most  
 active with events, hikes,camps etc.  
 most weekends of the year.            
   The Village Hall is the venue for   
 the well established Playgroup and the
 Mother and Toddler Group.The number of
 young children in the village has     
 increased to the point that even      
 though there are 8 half-day sessions  
 each week there is still a waiting    
 list of children to join.
