		<title>18CLUBS AROUND OSSINGTON.(1).</title>
		<content>    The church related group of the    
{Mothers Union}is the only club to be  
 based in the village of Ossington     
 itself and meetings are held once a   
 month, usually at the home of one of  
 the members. It helps to promote a    
 feeling of fellowship and is an       
 opportunity for the village ladies to 
 meet together to discuss various      
 chosen topics. At this particular time
 the enrolling member is the wife of   
 the local vicar and it is she who     
 takes control of the meeting.         
    There is also a weekly{yoga class  
 attended by a small number of ladies. 
 This form of relaxation may take place
 in the local village hall which is    
 commonly referred to as the{'Hut'.
