 I am doing a report on shoppers in    
 Burtle and near by.I asked some people
 that live in Burtle and on the out    
 side of Burtle were abouts they       
 shopped.                              
    The majority of people that I asked
 shopped in Street,Highbridge and      
 Glastonbury.Most went to the grocers  
 and Super Markets .                   
     People went to Taunton for cloths 
 and Street for shoes because Clarkes  
 have a factory there. The people that 
 I asked in the village normaly go to  
 the village shop for small daily      
 items.                                
     Every week vans come around       
 selling  househould goods and fish    
 and meat.                             
                                       
{                                      
                                       </content>
