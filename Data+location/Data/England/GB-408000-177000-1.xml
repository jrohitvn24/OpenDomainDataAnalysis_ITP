		<title>01BROADTOWN AREA...SUMMARY.</title>
		<content> Our block is centred on the Wiltshire 
 village of BroadTown which stretches  
 for about 2 miles along the B.4041    
 Wootton Bassett to Marlborough road.  
 The village, together with a number of
 hamlets, nestles at the foot of a     
 ridge of hills running east-west &amp; are
 on the edge of the Marlborough downs. 
    The area is a rural one with a     
 number of farms concerned with        
 dairying or beef fattening.Presently  
 most people work in or around         
 Swindon...a minority are employed on  
 local farms.Amenities are few...there 
 are no shops or even a post office.The
 church &amp; school were built just over  
 100 years ago.                        
    Walking or horse riding on         
 footpaths &amp; bridleways over the fields
 or along the hills provide leisure    
 opportunities for residents or        
 visitors.                             </content>
