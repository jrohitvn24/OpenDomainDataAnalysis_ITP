 Lindsay made an application to the    
 Board of Charity Commissioners for    
 England and Wales in{1870}for a Church
 school which was founded in{1875}for  
 70-80 pupils from surrounding villages
  In{1979}an extension was completed.  
 The school comprises three classrooms,
 a hall with kitchen, an office,       
 staffroom, library and cloakrooms.    
 Children attend{Swinford School}for   
 primary education. In{1985}there is a 
 Headteacher assisted by two teachers  
 and various part time staff including 
 a secretary, caretaker, dinner ladies 
 and numerous voluntary helpers. There 
 are now 52 pupils divided into infant,
 lower junior and upper junior classes.
  There is a Board of Governors who    
 assist in the running of the school.
