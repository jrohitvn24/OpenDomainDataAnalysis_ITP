		<content>The Rendcomb area is one of mixed      
farming where arable crops (spring     
wheat,spring barley &amp; winter wheat) are
grown.About half of the farms in this  
area had dairy herds with upto 310     
Freisian cattle.Some cattle would eat  
the grass right down to the roots and  
would eventually destroy the pasture.On
most farms the EEC effects were being  
felt.Beef was in plenty on some of the 
farms and a suckling herd on Marsden   
Manor had been given up.Nearly all the 
farms had grazing land for their       
various livestock.Hay being cut was    
used mainly for silage but also for    
animals such as horses.There was also a
large number of sheep on most farms.In 
Rendcomb some farms have not got any   
crops but have concentrated on         
livestock.
