		<content> Just south of Kempshott there is an   
 archeological dig of the old village  
 of{Hatch.}Aerial photographs showed   
 marks of Iron Age fields. From October
 1984 to April 1985 they have been     
 digging. They have also found an      
 abandoned Medieval village of late    
 12th to 14th century. It may have been
 left because many people died from the
 plague. A church and a cemetary have  
 been found with about forty graves,   
 including one of a priest who was     
 buried with a pewter chalice. They    
 have found some Roman/British pottery 
 but they are not sure if people have  
 lived there continuously from the Iron
 Age to the 14th century. They are busy
 recording all their findings from     
 Summer 1985 and hope to continue      
 excavating the Iron Age remains after 
 the harvest.
