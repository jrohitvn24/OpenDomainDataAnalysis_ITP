		<title>11Mrs Smith  A Villager</title>
		<content> Mrs Smith has lived in Corringham for 
 fifty years. She enjoys living there. 
 When she first moved to Corringham    
 there were not many buildings. She has
 moved house a couple of times and now 
 lives in Middle Street.               
  The only thing she does not like is  
 motor bikes, she said that sometimes  
 she is just trying to get to sleep and
 a motor bike goes past.               
  The population of the village has    
 grown a lot since she moved there.    
 Corringham has changed but she thinks 
 it has changed for the best because a 
 lot of new houses have been built.    
  There is not much vandalism in the   
 village.                              
  Mrs Smith works at the village hall, 
 but her life is very busy with looking
 after her mother who is an invalid.   
 If she has any spare time she         
 sometimes enjoys gardening.           </content>
