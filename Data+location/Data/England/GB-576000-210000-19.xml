		<content>{The A12.}I went to the A12 to count   
 how many cars go along in 25 minutes. 
 I thought there were 100 cars a day   
 but there were 104 in 25 minutes. I   
 was very surprised because there was  
 only one motorbike, one coach and 2   
 buses. I saw 3 lorries on the A12 all 
 at the same time and 6 cars at the    
 same time. The A12 goes from London to
 Great Yarmouth and I use the A12 as   
 well. On weekdays there are lots of   
 cars and vans rushing to work. On     
 Sunday there is less traffic because  
 shops are not open. The surface is    
 made of concrete and there were 2     
 lanes in each direction.              
{The Street. }This was the old A12 but 
 now is part of the network of minor   
 roads which connects Hatfield Peverel 
 with surrounding villages. The hourly 
{Bus Service}connects the village with 
 Chelmsford, Witham and Maldon.        </content>
