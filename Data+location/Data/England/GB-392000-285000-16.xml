		<content> Parts of this area have been described
 as villages surrounded by industry.   
 In the past people had a particular   
 attitude to maintaining an            
 independence from outside, and yet a  
 dependence upon each other, and the   
 areas resources.                      
                                       
 There was a pride in living here,     
 despite the poverty, poor conditions, 
 and hard work.  Now, most of the area 
 has been absorbed into large local    
 government boroughs, and there has    
 been a movement of population, so the 
 traditional attitudes are being broken
 up.  There is still poverty and       
 unemployment, but not the same        
 community spirit, and independence.   
 As someone said of a man who moved    
 into the area, "'E's not one of we".
