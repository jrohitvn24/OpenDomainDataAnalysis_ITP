		<title>05Farming in the Blackdowns</title>
		<content> The land is maninly grade 3 often with
 thin soiled steep sloping fields,above
 average rainfall causes more silage to
 be made than hay harvested,though lack
 of sun may reduce sugar content of    
 silage.Most farmhouses were built     
 during the peak of prosperity in mid  
 19th century.Farming has been         
 declining since,apart from during two 
 world wars when German submarines     
 prevented the import of cheap food    
 from the Dominions.In 1947 farmers    
 were actively exhorted to build up cow
 herds, mainly Friesian to produce milk
 for the Nation especially free milk to
 school children. On the Blackdowns    
 mixed farming was general,cows,sheep  
 arable,oats,wheat,barley, deeplitter  
 hens, Christmas birds using available 
 outbuildings joining local egg co-ops 
 giving employment as packers locally.
