		<title>09Blackbird Inn Ponteland</title>
		<content> This incorporates the remains of the  
 tower castle of Ponteland,built by    
 Roger Bertram(1150-90).It was         
 destroyed by the Earl of Douglas as he
 retreated with his army of Scots,after
 his attempt to take Newcastle upon    
 Tyne which was thwarted by Harry      
 Hotspur in 1388.It remained in ruins  
 for 200 years,and was rebuilt as a    
 manor house by Mark Errington.It      
 stayed in this catholic family's hands
 until 1774.Despite having their lands 
 confiscated during the Civil War they 
 later had them returned.The supposed  
 ghost dates from the Erringtons time  
 when a son committed suicide.It was   
 turned into an inn a century later.   
 The name originates from the billeting
 of foreign mercenaries known to the   
 locals as Blackbergers.Every New Years
 day a wheelbarrow race is held at the 
 Inn.                                  </content>
