		<content> Hannington is a small peaceful village
 situated on the Hampshire Downs 200 m 
 above sea level with outstanding views
 ofopen countryside and land given to a
 large proportion of arable cultivation
 The towns of Basingstoke &amp; Newbury are
 almost equidistant. The population is 
 280 including the small hamlet of     
 North Oakley, with an equal percent of
 young &amp; old. Although we have some    
 historical buildings-few amenities: no
 main drainage system, only septic     
 tanks. No street lighting, no shops,  
 Post Office or Library other than mo- 
 bile services. No mains gas only elec-
 tricity, woodburning stoves &amp; oil. No 
 public transport apart from a twice   
 weekly bus service. No school,this was
 closed in July 1984.                  
 This is an active community supporting
 many club activities for all ages.
