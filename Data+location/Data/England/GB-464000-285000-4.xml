		<content> Large numbers of rabbits, many with   
 myxomatosis, inhabit the slopes along 
 the north of our block and the old    
 railway embankment. There are foxes   
 and badgers. The canal, now used for  
 pleasure and coarse fishing, is home  
 to waterhens and mallard, visiting    
 swans and Canada geese. Black headed  
 gulls and herons can be seen. Plants  
 include jewelweed, water forgetmenot, 
 giant waterdock, lady smocks and marsh
 marigold. Birds include owls and 3    
 species of woodpecker and immigrant   
 warblers. Sparrows, starlings,        
 dunnocks, robins, blackbirds, tits,   
 swallows and magpies visit gardens.   
 Sunny days bring meadow brown,        
 gatekeeper, common blue, skipper,     
 small heath and peacock butterflies.  
 150 species of wild flowers grow in   
 the 3 churchyards.
