		<title>14SCHOOL DAY</title>
		<content>                                       
       The school day begins at nine   
 o'clock. Children enter their         
 classroom so that registration can    
 take place. Assemblies commence at    
 twenty past ten, continuing until     
 playtime at twenty to eleven. The     
 second part of the morning lasts from 
 five to eleven till mid-day.          
       Language, Mathematics and       
 Reading normally take place during the
 morning session, but interests or     
 special happenings very often alter   
 the programme of the morning's work.  
       Lunch is from mid-day until one 
 o'clock. Afternoon school ends at     
 three o'clock for the Infants and half
 an hour later for the Juniors, with a 
 fifteen minute break at a quarter past
 two.
