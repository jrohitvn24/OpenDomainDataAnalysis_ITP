		<title>13JOHN DICKINSON &amp; CROXLEY</title>
		<content> THE NAME DICKINSON IS VERY WELL KNOWN 
 IN CROXLEY GREEN BECAUSE OF THE PAPER 
 MILL JOHN DICKINSON BUILT BETWEEN THE 
 GRAND UNION CANAL AND THE RIVER GADE  
 IN 1830. WHEN THE MILL WAS FIRST BUILT
 CROXLEY WAS                           
 ONLY A HAMLET AND MOST OF             
 ITS RESIDENTS WERE EMPLOYED IN        
 FARMING.  THE MILL NEEDED WORKERS AND 
 THEY WERE RECRUITED FROM ALL OVER     
 ENGLAND. TO HOUSE THEM, DICKINSON HAD 
 HOUSES BUILT IN THE VILLAGE IN WHAT IS
 NOW KNOWN AS DICKINSON SQUARE. THERE  
 WAS ALSO A DICKINSON GUILD HOUSE WHICH
 WAS THE LOCAL COMMUNITY CENTRE UNTIL  
 DEMOLISHED SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND A    
 DICKINSON GUILD OF SPORT WHICH STILL  
 FUNCTIONS, BUT NO LONGER AS PART OF   
 THE MILL, AS THAT WAS CLOSED IN       
 DECEMBER 1980, JUST AFTER IT          
 CELEBRATED ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS
 OF PRODUCTION.                        </content>
