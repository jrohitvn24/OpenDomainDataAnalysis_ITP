		<title>16   SOME LOCAL INDUSTRY</title>
		<content> BRITISH CHROME AND CHEMICALS LTD. is a
 major manufacturer of a wide range of 
 chromium chemicals, developed from    
 imported chromite ore,  which are sold
 in the U.K. and throughout the world. 
 The industry was started on the site  
 at Urlay Nook 150 years ago by Robert 
 Wilson, a local farmer, to manufacture
 sulphuric acid and artificial         
 fertilisers.                          
 LYONS TETLEY is the largest tea bag   
 manufacturer in Europe. The tea is    
 either purchased in the London tea    
 auctions or from the country of origin
 such as India or Kenya. Teas are      
 blended together for taste and colour.
 It is tasted every one and a half     
 hours. Machines pack the tea into     
 various pack sizes, for distribution  
 throughout Britain and exportation to 
 Canada. Computers are used in the     
 factory in all stages of the work.    </content>
