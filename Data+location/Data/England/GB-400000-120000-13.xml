		<content> WIDOW of 78 years - "We are a very    
 happy community. I have got used to   
 the many changes and the isolation    
 does not worry me. The aches in my    
 shoulders are from the days when I had
 to fetch water from a field well when 
 our own well was dry. In 1950,        
 electricity came and mains water in   
 1955".  A London University           
 Administrator now widowed and retired 
 - "Life is harmonious &amp; serene. Our   
 peace is only punctuated by the harsh 
 intrusions of modern living - the     
 helicopter overhead and heavy road    
 traffic passing from a local farm     
 business taking a short cut to Wilton"
 Husband, wife &amp; 2 children - "We like 
 living in this village because of the 
 freedom of movement in the beautiful  
 countryside. We love the clean air and
 being able to pursue our hobby -      
 running - without restriction".       </content>
