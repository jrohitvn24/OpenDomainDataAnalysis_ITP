Much work and money is needed to keep  
the church clean and in good           
repair.There  are 72 ladies on the     
cleaning rota. Most recently repairs   
have been the replacing of the         
floorboards with heating put in under  
the new ones. The church used to have  
5 bells which wehe heaviest in         
Buckinghamshire.       However the     
wooden bell frame rotted andhad to be  
replaced with a metal one. There is    
now a full complement of 8 bells.There 
are about 12 bellringers with 2 or 3   
more learning the art. Because some of 
the bells are smaller   and lighter    
younger people can now learn to ring   
them.  Various activites are held to   
raise money for church repairs.
