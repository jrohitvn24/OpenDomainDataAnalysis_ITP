		<content>{St Agatha's Church} is the main       
Anglican Church in Brightwell cum      
Sotwell, and records date back to 854  
and an early Saxon Charter.  The       
first recorded Rector was in 1260. The 
Rector in 1985 is Rev. R. Hayne, who   
has lived and worked in the village    
for 8yrs.                              
{St.James, Sotwell} was rebuilt in     
1884, but the origins can be traced    
back to 1158. It shares the Rector     
with St. Agatha's. It is a delightful  
church and is well worth a visit.      
{Free Church} The Sotwell Free Church  
celebrated its centenary in 1985. Its  
present Pastor is the Rev. Adrian      
Brooks who has been there for 9 years. 
He takes two main services on Sundays  
and there are prayer meetings or house 
meetings on Wednesdays. The Free       
Church was started by Agusta           
Fairthorne.                            </content>
