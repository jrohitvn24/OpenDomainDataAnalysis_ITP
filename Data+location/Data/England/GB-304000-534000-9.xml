		<title>09MARYPORT + CARLISLE RAILWAY</title>
		<content> This line was built to develop the    
 west cumberland coalfield.in 1836     
 George Stevenson visited maryport to  
 survey the line as chief consultant   
 engineer.it was opened in stages      
 between 1840-45 from Maryport to      
 Carlisle via Aspatria and it never    
 breaks the 500ft contour line.the     
 first section opened in 1840 to       
 Arkleby.then in 1841another section   
 went to Aspatria.at Maryport they     
 built their own locomotives.          
 the original stations were Maryport,  
 Bullgill,Arkleby,Aspatria and Carlisle
 stations were modernised in the early 
 19 hundreds but trade did not improve 
 because of the decline in the coal and
 iron industries and in 1923 the       
 company was amalgamated into the LMS  
 and after nationalisation it was      
 controlled by british railways.diesel 
 multiple units now take passengers.   </content>
