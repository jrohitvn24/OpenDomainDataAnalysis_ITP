 In 1935 a competition was held for a  
 design for Winter Gardens in Ventnor. 
 It was built on the site of the       
 Vicarage and is considered to be a    
 typical building of that era. It      
 consists of a concert hall, bar and   
 cafeteria. Today it is being restored 
 to its original condition. During the 
 winter it is used by the local        
 population as a community centre. In  
 the summer concerts are arranged for  
 the holiday-makers. These acts are    
 appearing this year: Cliff Lazarenko, 
 Ted and Jean Redfern, Island Swing    
 Jazz Band and Ryde Concert Band. The  
 bar is called the Bell Bar because the
 warning bell from the end of the pier 
 hangs there. Plants are being         
 installed so that it can again become 
 a true winter garden.
