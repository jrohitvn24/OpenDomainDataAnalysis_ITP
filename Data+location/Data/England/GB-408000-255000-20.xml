		<title>20LOCAL SURVEY</title>
		<content>  Surveying one road on a local        
 housing estate in Alcester it was     
 discovered that only one quarter  of  
 the people actually worked in Alcester
 The majority  travelled at least five 
 miles to their place of work.Three    
 quarters of those asked  said  they   
 travelled to either Stratford or      
 Redditch to do their bulk shopping and
 only used the local shops for         
 emergencies.This is understandable as 
 there is no really large supermarket  
 in Alcester.There are  high quality   
 shops, however, which offer a good    
 service to those who cannot travel.   
    Looking at transport in the 1980's 
 we asked every  child in our school   
 how many cars in the family.We found  
 out that half had two or more cars.A  
 result of transport cuts and the fact 
 that more mums work and need cars.
