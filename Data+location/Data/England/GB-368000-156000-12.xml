		<title>12Lisa's Day</title>
		<content> It is 7.30 when I emerge from my room.
 I go into Mum's room to watch TV until
 8.00.Then I get dressed, but I do not 
 have to wear school uniform. I creep  
 downstairs and have choc.&amp; hazelnut   
 spread on toast for breakfast. After  
 cleaning my teeth I say goodbye and go
 to the shop where my friend lives.    
 Then we walk up the hill to school.   
 When we arrive we play till 9.00 when 
 we go into assembly. I often play the 
 music for the hymns. Afterwards we    
 have maths and English. We have       
 another playtime at 10.40 and then    
 work until lunchtime. A typical school
 lunch might be fish, chips and beans  
 followed by jam tart. After school I  
 play with my friends and watch TV     
 until bedtime at 9.30..               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
