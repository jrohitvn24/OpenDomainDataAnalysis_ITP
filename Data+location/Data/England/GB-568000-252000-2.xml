		<content>                                       
In the village of Cowlinge there are   
101 dwellings consisting of farms,     
houses and cottages. The population    
numbers 261 and of these 51 are        
children (ie. under the age of 16). The
local council owns 24 houses and 3     
houses are second homes and are used   
only at weekends. The rest of the      
houses are privately owned. A small    
percentage of the population are       
retired professional people, and a very
small percentage are agricultural      
workers, all other livelihoods are     
earned in the neighbouring towns. A    
number of married women also travel to 
work in the towns. The children are    
bussed to school, the old village      
school being closed some years ago.    
Little Bradley has 41 people and 1     
child.
