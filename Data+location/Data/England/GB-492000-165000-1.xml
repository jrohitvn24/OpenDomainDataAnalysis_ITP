		<title>01CHARTERS SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Charters School is situated on the out
 skirts of Sunningdale.Before 1958 the 
 land was used for grazing cattle.There
 are now 1296 pupils and about 80 staff
 at the school.166 are currently in the
 Sixth Form.'Charters'has a very good  
 reputation for P.E.and apart from the 
 usual facilities it  has a Recreation 
 Centre which is used by the local     
 community.Charters is hoping to open  
 up its doors to more handicapped      
 people-at the moment it has 12.One    
 unusual aspect of the school is that  
 it part-owns a Residential Centre in  
 Wales called Tirabad.                 
 Charters became comprehensive in 1970 
 and is considered to be a very happy  
 place with no traditions-except for   
 good teaching!                        
 The school crest is very unusual in   
 that it depicts a shield within a     
 shield containing a stag's head.      </content>
