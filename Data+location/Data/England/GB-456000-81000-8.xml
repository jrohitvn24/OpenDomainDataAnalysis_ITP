		<content> Sandown and Shanklin on the coast are 
 heavily populated and built up.       
 Inland ,to the east,the land is much  
 more open and includes some scrub and 
 woodland.                             
                                       
                                       
 Most of the fields around our area are
 used as pasture land for cattle       
 belonging to near by farms.Not much of
 the land is used for crops because of 
 the chalky soil.                      
 Here are the names of some of the     
 farms in our area:Yard Farm,Hill Farm,
 Apse Manor Farm,Peartree Farm,Branston
 Farm Cheverton Farm,Merry Gardens Farm
 and Princelett Farm.There are a number
 of market gardens also in the area    
 which sell vegetables and fruit etc.  
 We also have a poultry farm which owns
 no less than 16,000 hens.
