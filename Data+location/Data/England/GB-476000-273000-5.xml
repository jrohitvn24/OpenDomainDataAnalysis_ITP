		<title>05Housing in OLD</title>
		<content>  Old is a small village of            
 approximately 500 .It has several     
 large houses built of{ironstone.}Many 
 of the small farm cottages of the past
 have been modernised and extended to  
 create large and comfortable          
 homes.Some barns have also been       
 converted.There are few houses that   
 have been built since the 1945 War and
 little modern housing,except for six  
 old folks bungalows constructed in the
 last 10 years.                        
  The population has increased over the
 last 15 years due mainly to people    
 moving from towns to be part of a     
 'village community'.It is these people
 who have improved the old properties. 
  There seems to be a division between 
 the 'new' arrivals and the those who  
 have been in the village all there    
 lives (oldest a lady of 84).
