		<content>  Most people thought there was not    
 enough for children and teenagers to  
 do.They think  "That the{Sports Centre
{and library}which will open in 1986   
 are good ideas because they will give 
 the young people somewhere to go ,if  
 it is not vandalised."The Dancing     
 Teacher does not want the new centre  
 because{"It will be more expensive to 
{hire."}People would hope to see keep  
 fit, slimming and music classes.      
  A few people thought that there      
 should be a{cinema.                   
  Some people felt the building of the 
 Tower Block{(Derwent Tower )}to be    
 un-necessary.They suggested tht it was
 "Not a nice place to live ."They did  
 however think the new houses are an   
 improvement for "Each new house has a 
 garden of it's own."
