		<content> Westbury lies on the A422 an east/west
 route linking Stratford, Banbury,     
 Brackley, Buckingham and Bedford. It  
 is 2\ miles from Brackley  and 5 miles
 from Buuckingham. In 1931 there were  
 few cars and no buses. Farmers and    
 gentry possessed horses and carriages 
 but the ordinary villages walked. A   
 railway line just to the south with a 
 station a mile away at Fulwell was    
 invaluable for transporting milk and  
 farm supplies.When it closed in 1960  
 buses saved the villagers a walk. Now 
 that most families own a car, the     
 older villagers depend on lifts and   
 just 3 buses a day to Brackley. On    
 market day a special bus extends to   
 Buckingham.School buses fetch young   
 children to Westbury and take older   
 ones to middle and secondary schools  
 in Buckingham.Bicester 10,Banbury 12  
 and Bletchley 18miles have railways.  </content>
