		<title>06New Bungalows.</title>
		<content>Eight bungalows are being built in     
Gt.Addington where people used to park 
their lorries.A house has been built   
next to the Hare and Hounds            
public house.There is also a big house 
that has been built on top of a        
bungalow.The windows are small to save 
money on heating but yet some of the   
houses have fairly big windows.Two     
houses have different coloured bricks. 
People used to call the place where the
eight bungalows are the lorry park or  
the green.The roofs are all built of   
tiles on all of the new buildings.There
are nine rooms in the bungalows.In the 
bungalows there are two garages and one
chimney pot on each one.
