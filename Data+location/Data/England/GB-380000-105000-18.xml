		<content> Hedge End Farm covers most of this    
 area. The remainder is Crown Land     
 bought from the estate of the Portman 
 family. All this land is let.         
                                       
 Hedge End Farm is owned by Prudential 
 Insurance, who are trying to sell it  
 for three_quarters of a million       
 pounds.                               
 The farm was bought from a family and 
 divided into three farms. The son of  
 the previous owner now owns the North 
 Barn portion, a sister lives on this  
 land in a large stone_built house.    
 The farm manager took over three years
 ago. He lives in  part of the main    
 house. The house is Victorian, well_  
 maintained and has a swimming pool.   
 There are five tied cottages and there
 is also a pair of houses for sale.
