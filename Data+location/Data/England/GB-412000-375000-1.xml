{Tideswell}(population 2000).The old   
 part of Tideswell is a{Conservation   
{Area.}The A673 runs through the       
 northern part,and is crossed by the   
 B6049 which runs through Tideswell.   
 Wheston,(pop.40) is a hamlet about 2km
 WNW of Tideswell.                     
  The area is in that part of the{Peak 
{National Park}called The White Peak;so
 named from the underlying limestone   
 which has been used for walls ,and    
 which in the sunlight show as white   
 lines across the landscape.           
  Many people in Tideswell work in     
 surrounding quarries or allied trades,
 but a few commute to nearby towns.    
 There is some light industry as well  
 as tourist and other services.
