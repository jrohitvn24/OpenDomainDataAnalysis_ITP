		<title>16Recreation in West Enfield.</title>
		<content>  By doing a survey in our school we   
 found that the children's main        
 recreation activities are Guides or   
 Brownies (51),Scouts or Cubs          
 (46),Sunday School (59), and Girls or 
 Boys Brigade (20).                    
  Our area is mainly a residential     
 one.Most of the houses have fairly    
 large gardens and almost all the      
 people questioned named gardening as  
 one of their main pastimes.The other  
 pastime which seemed almost universal 
 was D.I.Y.Watching T.V.,Video and     
 playing computer games are popular    
 with children and adults.Other        
 pastimes which proved popular were    
 listening to and playing music,dancing
 watching and playing different sports.
  As family groups they go out together
 swimming,to watch sport,to the theatre
 cinema and museums.
