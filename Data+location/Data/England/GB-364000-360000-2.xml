		<content> The village is situated at the site of
 an old{ford}across the Weaver. The    
 present bridge was built in 1701 to   
 allow easy transport of bricks for the
 rebuilding of the church. The         
 appearance of the village is somewhat 
 withdrawn as most of the houses have  
 high hedges to the road, their gardens
 running behind to the river. It is a  
{conservation area.}There are 12       
 listed buildings in the area.They have
 all been restored in the last ten     
 years. The principle feature of the   
 village is the nucleus of 16th cent.  
{timber framed buildings.}They are     
 reputed to have been built around 1588
 with timber released from Delamere    
 Forest by Queen Elizabeth I for the   
 rebuilding of Nantwich after the great
 fire. These three cottages, the Mill  
 House and Church Farm which has a     
 magpie porch are all in good condition</content>
