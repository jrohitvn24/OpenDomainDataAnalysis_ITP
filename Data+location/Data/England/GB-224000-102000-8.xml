		<title>08The Antique Shop, Bridgerule</title>
		<content>  Quite surprisingly, for Bridgerule is
 a very small place indeed, there is a 
 small but well established antique    
 shop right in the centre of the       
 village and opposite the local inn.   
  The owners have lived in Bridgerule  
 since 1938 and one of the partners    
 attended the village school and notes 
 many changes which have occured in    
 subsequent years. The shop itself was 
 built in 1921. Before this there was  
 just a cottage in which a lady lived  
 whose trade was dressmaking.          
  Having established their small       
 antique trade, the present owners     
 extended and fully modernised the     
 building which now provides them with 
 a comfortable home and steady income. 
 Until recently, the present owner was 
 the representative for the local press
 ensuring that all items of interest   
 were recorded and published.          </content>
