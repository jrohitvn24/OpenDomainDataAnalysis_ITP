		<content>   {Mr. Clark. Mayor of Sandhurst,}told
 us about his childhood in the{193O's. 
 He was born at home with help from the
 District Nurse. Milk came from        
 Ambarrow Farm. Some farmers illegally 
 watered it down. Altogether there were
 8 farms in Sandhurst. He attended the 
 Methodist School on School Hill, which
 later became New Scotland Hill.       
 Lessons were split between schools,   
 girls travelled 2.5 miles to Broadmoor
 School for 0.5 days Domestic Science. 
 His father-in-law worked at Wellington
 College as a carpenter. Mr. Clark     
 later worked there as a steward. For a
 Sunday School treat they walked to    
 Blackwater Station and travelled to   
 Wellington College Halt which was     
 built of a few railway sleepers.
