		<content>    The not_very_famous Three Counties 
 Show was a great success.This is an   
 annual union of Herefordshire,        
 Worcestershire, and Gloucestershire.  
 The reconstruction of the legendary   
 Ambridge Village, home of the Archers,
 boosted its success. The Archers were 
 actually there, along with a village  
 pond, with live ducks, a goat, and, of
 course, the Bull Inn! Entertainment   
 was there on a village stage, and this
 was good. Crown Meadow, my school did 
 some dancing. There was a comedian    
 with a funny hat on, and a lively     
 band. There were some sheep, great big
 things, not cuddly! The bulls were    
 huge, one was bigger than me. Even the
 rabbits were large. The goat was nice,
 it licked anyone that went near it.   
 The tractors went to and fro. I was   
 sad when we had to leave.
