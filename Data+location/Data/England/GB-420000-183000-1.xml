 up in history. An ancient British road
 (The Rigeway)runs across the southern 
 tip.This was crossed by the Roman road
 of Ermin Way from Cirencester to      
 Speen,so Wanborough was an important  
 meeting place for nomadic people      
 and for roman soldiers on the march.  
 A  sizeable Roman villa was at the    
 northern end of the village           
 (durocornovium) of the name of nidum,

 in the museum at Devizes.In

 Wanborough with the neighbouring      
 "tons".A battle was fought in the area
 of Wanborough plain beyond the Ridgewa</content>
