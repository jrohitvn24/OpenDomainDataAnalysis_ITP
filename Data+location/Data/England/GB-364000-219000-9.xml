 Preece Moor - Some of these farmhouses
 have reverted to ordinary private     
 household usuage and no longer have   
 connections with the farmland around  
 them.The local farmers have purchased 
 these farms when they became available
 and with little or any increase in    
 numbers of farm employees formerly    
 employed by them, have made the larger
 units more economically.This has      
 resulted in a depopulation in the     
 rural areas for they tend to seek work
 in other parts of the country in any  
 trade for the local factories are     
 reducing their own numbers of staff.  </content>
