		<content> The relief of the area is generally   
 low-lying with the majority of it     
 about 4-5 metres above sea level. The 
 main low lying areas are either side  
 of the River Ouse which flows from    
 south to north through the middle of  
 the area. There are two areas of      
 higher ground, one to the east which  
 rises to 20 metres above sea level and
 one to the east which reaches 11      
 metres above sea level.               
       The shape of the ground on the  
 higher areas is very gently undulating
 with no steep slopes, contour lines   
 are few and far between and in fact   
 the only one is the 15 metre line     
 found in the eastern half of the area.
 The remainder of the area has no      
 contour lines on it at all.
