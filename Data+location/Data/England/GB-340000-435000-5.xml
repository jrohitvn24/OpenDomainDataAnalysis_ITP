		<content> This village has seen a small amount  
 of development in the last ten to     
 twelve years, during which time houses
 have been built.  Though different in 
 design to the old handmade brick and  
 slate roof cottages, the new dormer   
 types with faced brick work, painted  
 white and steeply pitched tiled roofs 
 complement the village scene.  The old
 farm houses, one of which is called   
 Roseacre Hall Farm, are very large in 
 proportion with ample room for        
 families.  They are very high too     
 which presents problems with heating. 
 The cellars are still used in some    
 farmhouses to keep foodstuffs cool.   
 Pleasing features of the old houses   
 are the hand made bricks, which were  
 made locally, and the stone lintels.  
 Sash and cord windows are a feature of
 this type of house.
