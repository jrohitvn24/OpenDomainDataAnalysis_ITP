		<title>09 Cookhill Priory</title>
		<content>  In the 13th century Isabell,Countess 
of Warwick founded a Nunnery on the    
site of the present day Priory,which   
lies 3 miles to the east of Inkberrow  
on the Ridge Way.In 1542 it was granted
to Nicholas and Catharine Fortescue and
has been passed down the family ever   
since.Today it is owned by an elderly  
spinster called Miss Antrobus and it   
has been converted into a farm.The only
original part is the chapel,made of    
timber and cased with grey brick,now   
derelict but it still contains many    
plaques commemorating the Fortescue    
family.Of this chapel the only original
parts are the east and north walls.Miss
Antrobus lives at the rear and Mr.Bevan
occupies the front part.On the side is 
a wooden Tudor dwelling which          
originally housed the servants but is  
now occupied by a young couple.
