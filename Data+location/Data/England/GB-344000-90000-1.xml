		<content>      This area includes the southern  
 half of the town of Bridport with its 
 important shopping centre which serves
 most of West Dorset. The A35 trunk    
 road, one of the main holiday routes  
 to Devon and Cornwall, passes through 
 the centre of the town.               
      To the south of the old compact  
 centre of the town there are new      
 housing estates at Skilling,          
 Bothenhampton and Wanderswell to cater
 for the rising population of the area.
      Two miles to the south of        
 Bridport is the small holiday resort  
 of West Bay centred on the old        
 Bridport Harbour which is at the      
 western end of Chesil Beach. To the   
 east is the vertical East Cliff of    
 yellow sandstone while to the west are
 the landslip cliffs of West Cliff and 
 Thorncombe Beacon.
