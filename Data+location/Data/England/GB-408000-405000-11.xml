		<title>11Education  Typical day</title>
		<content> A typical menu for school dinners is  
 as follows:-                          
   Salad, or Beefburgers with chips, or
 Sausage Rool with roast potatoes. We  
 then have a sweet course which may be 
 a choice of Ice cream in a wafer, or a
 milk drink and a biscuit, or fruit (an
 apple, an orange or a banana).        
  Afternoon school starts at 1.10pm.   
 Today we start with two periods of    
 mathematics after which we have just a
 five minute break. We can go to the   
 toilet at this time and then on to    
 our last lesson for the day. The last 
 lesson (two peroids) is science. In   
 our First year at Holmfirth High      
 School. Science is a combination of   
 Biology, Chemistry and Physics.       
  At 3.20pm the bell goes to signal the
 end of school for the day, and I catch
 a bus home.
