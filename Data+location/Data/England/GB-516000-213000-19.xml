		<content> The Devils Dyke is an ancient         
 battlefield in Wheathampstead where   
 lots of people live today.The entrance
 to the Dyke is part of a city built in
 the 1st century B.C. A set of gates   
 were presented by the Rt Hon Lord     
 Brocket to commemorate their majesties
  King George VI and Queen Elizabeth's 
 coronation on the 12th May 1937.It was
 probably here that Julius Ceasar      
 defeated the British King called      
 Cassivellavinus in 54 B.C.Today the   
 Dyke is used for playing in and       
 dumping rubbish in there.There are    
 more trees in there to make it easier 
 to get up the steep hills.There are   
 some blank spaces where you just slide
 down the hills.It is rich with holly  
 trees and there are a few stinging    
 nettles.
