		<content> A school has existed in Hullavington  
 since{1833.}In that year{Sir Joseph  {
{Neeld,}owner of Grittleton House,     
 founded a two roomed, stone building  
 in the centre of the village.This     
 school was enlarged in{1873}to        
 coincide with the increased population
 provided by the 'Navigators', working 
 on the Great Western Railway, &amp; then  
 living at Kingsway. Brick cloakrooms &amp;
 an earth closet were added in         
{1914.}This school remained largely    
 unaltered, with the exception of the  
 additional use of temporary wooden    
 'Pratten' huts &amp; the village hall,    
 until{1971.'Phase one' of a new       
{Primary School,}built on a flat       
 roofed, modular, 'Open Plan' design   
 was erected at the North-Eastern end  
 of the village at that date.Both      
 buildings are still in use for the    
 present 94 children &amp; 5 teachers.     </content>
