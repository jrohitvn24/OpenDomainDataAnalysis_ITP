		<content> Apart from home slide shows or cards, 
 the inhabitants tend to go as far     
 afield as Exeter, Plymouth or St.     
 Austell for the performing arts. The  
 exception to this is a couple of      
 pantomimes and a summer show in the   
 small towns of Bude or Holsworthy. The
 last cinema in the area closed in Bude
 in 1985. There is a music society and 
 two choirs in Bude, the former        
 arranging recitals each month and the 
 latter concerts twice yearly.There are
 brass bands at Holsworthy and Bude,   
 both in demand in the area, including 
 Kilkhampton.There is a variety concert
 held there every year, when local     
 talent is enjoyed and at which the    
 Queen and attendants are chosen for   
 the celebration of St. James' Day in  
 July. The inhabitants are also        
 involved in entertainments in         
 neighbouring villages                 </content>
