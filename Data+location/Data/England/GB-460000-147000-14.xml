		<content> Families play some games together on a
 wet day,like Monopoly or Scrabble.Most
 people have a holiday when they go    
 away for 1 or 2 weeks. Staying in a   
 caravan or tent or 'self-catering' at 
 the seaside is popular. Quite a few   
 people go abroad.                     
 Some people go to church on a Sunday, 
 and children go to Sunday school.     
 Mothers usually do the housework,     
 cooking, cleaning and washing, but    
 children often help with the washing  
 up. Most homes have electric or gas   
 cookers,  and some have microwave     
 ovens.Mum uses lots of gadgets to make
 jobs easier: vacuum cleaner, mixers   
 and choppers. Fathers wash or repair  
 their cars at the weekends. Some      
 families have animals which they keep 
 as pets in the house, like dogs, cats 
 and hamsters.They are looked after by 
 the family.                           </content>
