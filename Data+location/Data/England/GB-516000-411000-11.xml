		<title>11Our School</title>
		<content> The new school was opened in November 
 1982. Before this the school was huts.
 Now we have a proper building with    
 three classrooms and a hall and       
 library.The hall is used for dinners  
 and assemblies  as well as P.E.There  
 are also rooms for the head teacher   
 and staff and the secretary.We have 63
 children in 3 classrooms.We have four 
 teachers.Two of the classes open into 
 an activity area where we do craft and
 such things.The small room where we   
 watch T.V.listen to the radio or do   
 group work.All the furniture in the   
 scool is new.Most of the school is    
 carpeted too.we also have a lot new   
 apparatus and equipment including our 
 computer. We think the new school is  
 much better than the old one.
