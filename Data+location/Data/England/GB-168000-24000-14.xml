		<content> Mawgan Church was built between the   
 second century and the thirteenth     
 century.It has six bells.The local    
 Vicar's name is the Reverent Long.On  
 the main entrance there is a dog door 
 which was used for letting dogs in and
 out.In the Lady Chapel there is a     
 stone effigy of Sir Roger De Carrinou 
 and his widow Lady Johanna who were   
 descendants of King Arthur.Near that  
 there is a small cross with a light   
 beneath it.It is always lit up because
 the sacrificial is in the Lady        
 Chapel.In the vestry, there are a few 
 original stones dating from the       
 13th.C.The Rev.Long put a cross there 
 to commemorate finding the stones.The 
 church is built of granite blocks.The 
 arches are built with a keystone and  
 the pillars are made of porcelain     
 stone.Mawgan is a very welcoming      
 church.                               </content>
