		<title>09ONGAR'S SOCIAL CONCERNS</title>
		<content>   The Ongar{Civic Trust}is agreed on  
 the need for a{by-pass.}There are two 
 possible routes. One lies to the east 
 for easy access to LECA ,a works to   
 the south east of Ongar which produces
 materials to make concrete.The        
 western by-pass would run along the   
 banks of the Cripsey brook.           
  Some members of the Civic Trust are  
 concerned that the land to the east of
 Ongar has good ammenity value and     
 would be seriously scarred by an      
 eastern by-pass.It would cut through  
 the river Roding at some point and the
 present estates on the eastern side of
 Ongar.                                
  People favour the western route      
 because it would reduce congestion in 
 the High Street and allow development 
 of blighted land behind the High      
 Street for parking and residential /  
 light industrial use.                 </content>
