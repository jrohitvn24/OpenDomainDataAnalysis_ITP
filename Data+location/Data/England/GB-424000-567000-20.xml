		<title>20LAW AND ORDER IN LONGBENTON</title>
		<content> Crimes in the Longbenton area are     
 theft, robbery and vandalism. People  
 do these things because they are      
 unemployed, they don't have enough    
 money or they are criminals.          
 I think it must be very sad to be     
 burgled. The people who do it must be 
 sick.                                 
 Vandalism in this area is mostly done 
 by teenagers or drunks. Silly children
 go glue sniffing near play schemes.   
 We can stop crime by putting more     
 policemen on the beat and also by     
 having more neighbourhood watch       
 schemes.                              
 I think the pubs should only sell beer
 to adults and they should only be     
 allowed to sell certain amounts.      
 I think it is a shame that crimes like
 this spoil Longbenton, otherwise it   
 would be a better area.
