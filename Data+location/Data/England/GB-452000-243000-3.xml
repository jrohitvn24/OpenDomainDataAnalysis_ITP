		<title>03A dairy farmer's typical day</title>
		<content>Before dawn the dairy farmer drives    
the herd of sixty Friesians from their 
straw littered building to the         
collecting yard to be milked.He lets   
the first eight cows into the parlour, 
to feed on concentrates while they are 
milked by the electrically powered     
milking machine.When the collecting    
tank is full of cooled milk it is      
syphoned out by a milk tanker and taken
away to be bottled.                    
The electrified fence is set near the  
silage clamp so the cows can reach     
their ration.                          
Three times a day the farmer clears    
away the slurry with a tractor and     
scraper .Before afternoon milking he   
must spread fifty bales of litter      
straw. By bedtime he has checked each  
cow.If one is calving he may stay to   
help.                                  
                                       </content>
