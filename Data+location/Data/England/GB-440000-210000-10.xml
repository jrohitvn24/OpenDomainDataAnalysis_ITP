		<title>10METHODIST CHAPEL, FREELAND</title>

The chapel is almost opposite the      
church, at the corner of Pigeon House  
Lane. It is older than the church, as  
it was built in 1805.  A small         
rectangular stone building with round  
headed windows, it is much plainer than
the church, both inside and out.       
                                       
Inside it has been refitted with a     
cloakroom and a small kitchen for      
making coffee. The floor has been      
covered with brown carpet tiles, and a 
cross has been made in the floor carpet
tiles of a darker brown. The seats are 
plastic and moveable, and the only     
Victorian furniture left is the wooden 
dais and rail, and reading desk. At the
back there is an old harmonium but the 
electric organ is used for services.
