		<content>       Farming in East Preston.        
   Mr. Francis, whose father became    
 head gardener at Kingston Manor in    
 1920, told us there used to be about  
 400 sheep in the fields locally before
 1939-45 war. Cattle and pigs were     
 kept. 20 shire horses worked the land.
 People bought their milk from the     
 farms and walked everywhere, though a 
 few had horses and traps. Farm        
 labourers worked 15-16 hours a day in 
 summer getting up at 4 a.m. In the    
 school holidays children earned pocket
 money by helping with the harvest.    
 That, explained Mr. Francis, was how  
 he became the proud owner of a Â£4.00  
 bicycle.                              
   Now Kingston Farm with 30 sheep and 
 a small herd of cows is the only one  
 of the 4 farms left. Originally the   
 farmer had a little shop. Crispa Cress
 and Langmead's now work the land.     </content>
