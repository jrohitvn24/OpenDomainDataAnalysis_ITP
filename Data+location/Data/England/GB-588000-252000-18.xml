		<title>18THE CHURCH IN COCKFIELD 1985</title>
		<content>Today we went to the church.It is      
called St. Peter's Church.When we got  
there, we asked the rector,Rev.J.Cook, 
some questions.He said that on some    
Sundays about 45 people go to church.  
The Sunday School starts at the same   
time as the morning service and the    
children come in half way through the  
service.The people who help in running 
the church are the two churchwardens,  
the organist,a verger and a layreader. 
The school and the church are closely  
linked because on Ascension Day and St.
Peter's Day, the schoolchildren go to  
the church for a special service.On    
some Tuesday mornings,the rector will  
come and give lessons to the infant and
junior classes.The other churches that 
the rector looks after are Felsham,    
Gedding and Bradfield St.George.In the 
Cockfield choir,there are 17 people and
you can join when you are 8 years old. </content>
