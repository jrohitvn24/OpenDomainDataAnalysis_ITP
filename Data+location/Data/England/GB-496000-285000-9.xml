{ BIRD WATCHING CONT'D                 
                                       
   The bird watchers observe a variety 
  of different birds, ranging from     
  herons to partridges. Other types of 
  wildlife include two types of        
  deer - Fallow and Chinese water deer.
                                       
{ SOCIAL ACTIVITIES                    
                                       
   There are not many social activities
  that go on in Lyveden as it is not   
  heavily populated. There is an annual
  bonfire party which is held at the   
  Manor. We are told that this is very 
  enjoyable, but couldn't see for      
  ourselves because the survey work    
  was being done in July! Perhaps      
  we'll be more successful in 2086!
