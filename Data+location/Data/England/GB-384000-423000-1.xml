		<title>01Introducing Bacup and Water</title>
		<content> Bacup and Water are situated in the   
{Forest of Rossendale}but there is no  
 natural forest now! The surrounding   
 area of hill farms is generally over  
 1000 feet,very wet with a high annual 
 rainfall. Snow often falls up to April
 and May.                              
   All main roads go along the valleys-
 the main valley being the Irwell.     
 Water is on the road from Waterfoot to
 Burnley. Bacup is the larger town     
 built on the River Irwell and at the  
 crossroads of the A671 Burnley to     
 Rochdale and the A681 Todmorden to    
 Rawtenstall.                          
   The valley at Water and the town at 
 Bacup are totally different as you can
 see. We think both have something of  
 interest. Our story is naturally in   
 two parts.                            
                                       
                                       </content>
