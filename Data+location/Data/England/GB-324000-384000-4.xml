		<content>   Our school was developed as an      
 evacuee organised at Irby Methodist   
 Hall during the last war. At first    
 children came from Wallasey but later 
 the school was used by Channel Island 
 refugees.So many people came,that they
 decided to build another one.         
   Our school was built in 1951 and the
 first headmaster was called Mr.Hewitt 
 but our present Headmaster is         
 Mr.Rankin.                            
   There are 371 children in the school
 split up intp 12 classes.             
   The school is in Coombe Road.If you 
 go to the top of Coombe Road on a     
 clear day,you can see a district in   
 Lancashire which is called Black      
 Coombe.
