		<title>09Family Life in a Shop</title>
		<content>   I live in a shop that sells clothes 
 and wool. Because of this, my parents,
 especially my mother, work as shop    
 keepers. Our house is designed so that
 the living room  and kitchen are      
 behind the shop. Upstairs is like a   
 normal house, having bedrooms and a   
 bathroom. All the family, including   
 myself and my grandmother (who lived  
 in the shop before we did), help in   
 the shop. Most of the work demands at 
 least one person working, so we can't 
 very often go out on holidays though  
 sometimes we go to the coast on       
 Sundays.                              
   We have guard dogs incase we have   
 any break-ins. These also are pets.   
   The shop opens at 9 a.m. and shuts  
 at 6 p.m..This means 9 hours of work  
 for my mother.
