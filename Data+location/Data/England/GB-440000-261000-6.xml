		<content>   The oldest traditional event in     
 Southam is the Mop Fair held in       
 October of each year. Servants used to
 be hired at the Mop, but now it is    
 just a fair spreading right through   
 the centre of the town, attracting    
 people from the villages nearby with  
 its colour and noise. The fair is     
 combined with an Ox Roast, again an   
 ancient custom, recently revived.     
     Each year, on Spring Bank Holiday 
 Monday, there is a carnival. Local    
 organisations decorate lorries and    
 people wear fancy dress and parade    
 through the streets.                  
     During the summer there are many  
 fetes whose aim is to raise money for 
 local charities. There are things to  
 buy, games to play, sights to watch   
 and things to eat. It is a pleasant   
 way to spend a sunny afternoon, but   
 not in 1985 which has been very wet.  </content>
