		<title>14THE BARRACKS</title>
		<content> The barracks are situated south east  
 of the church, on the opposite side of
 the road. The barracks are made of red
 brick and are a part of a 14 acre     
 field. The barracks were built about  
 1939 to 1940. The roof in the air-raid
 shelter is held up by wooden or iron  
 beams. There is an air raid shelter   
 with a fire place and a passage which 
 has been blocked up. In the air raid  
 shelter there are iron steps going to 
 the roof. The shelters are in very dim
 light and one room was much darker    
 than the others. Several of the       
 shelters are surrounded by dence      
 undergrowth which makes access        
 extremely difficult. The barracks were
 the home of the Allied Forces.        
 Apparently this was the only gunning  
 implacement in Barrow that shot down  
 an enemy plane during the second world
 war.                                  </content>
