		<title>05The Saxon Burial Ground</title>
		<content> The burial ground was found in 1982   
 when boys playing discovered a        
 skeleton. The dig by Cleveland County 
 Archaeological Service used labour    
 from the Manpower Services Commission 
 and started in March 1984. The        
 archaeoligists in charge were Steve   
 Sherlock and Hedley Swan. They have   
 found 118 skeletons, 3 cremations and 
 a series of ditches. The skeletons    
 were buried north - south which tells 
 us they were not Christians as they   
 were buried east - west. The skeletons
 date from 550 to 600 A.D. The women   
 were buried with brooches, pins and   
 knives and the men with spears and    
 shields. The cremated remains with    
 miniature grave goods were found in   
 large urns. Skeletons of all ages have
 been found but the average age was    
 between 30 and 40.
