		<title>15HOUSING IN YATTON</title>
		<content>       The older houses in             
 Yatton are situated along the High    
 Street.They are mainly constructed of 
 the locally-quarried grey             
 limestone.At the Horsecastle end of   
 Yatton can be found many small        
 terraced houses built for the workers 
 in the former furniture               
 factory.After the first World War a   
 complete estate known as Wakedean     
 Gardens  was built by the factory     
 owners, Wake and Dean.At the end of   
 the 19th and beginning of 20th century
 several large houses were built by    
 wealthy people between the village and
 the station. Immediately before and   
 after the second World War more houses
 were built,for instance at Derhem Park
 ,but the major expansion of the       
 village occurred in the sixties and   
 seventies. More house may be built on 
 the site of the furniture factory.    </content>
