		<content>  The first part of Rochford Hospital  
 was built in 1890, but it has improved
 since the war. In 1947 the newest     
 part opened. There are 2000 nurses    
 and 70 doctors in Rochford Hospital.  
 There are 26 wards and 650 beds. Each 
 ward has 15 beds and 15 people. 4500  
 people are employed altogether        
 including caretaking staff, cooks,    
 bricklayers, etc. The hospital does 90
 operations a week, and 4000 a year.   
 There are about 5100 accidents a year.
 The hospital covers 25 acres. There   
 are 45 complaints out of 2300         
 outpatients. That's not bad! There are
 5700 patients treated per year. In    
 1983 3600 babies were born. Out of 26 
 wards the biggest ward is Johnson     
 Ward. Rochford hospital has a special 
 baby unit. They are going to spend Â£5\
 million pounds on new buildings in the
 next few years to make it even bigger.</content>
