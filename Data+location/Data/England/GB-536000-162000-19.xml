		<content> AT WICKHAM COURT THE LAND IS OWNED    
 BY MR DILLAN THE FARMER.THERE ARE 479 
 ACRES ALTOGETHER 65 ACRES OF  IT IS   
 WHEAT 13 ACRES OF IT IS  PEAS AND 15  
 ACRES IS POTATOES 15 ACRES OF BARLEY  
 AND THE REST OIL SEED RAPE.HIS HOUSE  
 WAS BUILT AROUND 1850.THE BARLEY IS   
 GROWN WITH THE WHEAT BECAUSE THE BIRDS
 LIKE WHEAT BUT PREFER THE BARLEY SO BY
 THE TIME THE WHEAT IS READY FOR       
 HARVESTING THE BARLEY HAS ALL BEEN    
 EATEN BY THE BIRDS BUT HARDLY ANY OF  
 THE WHEAT HAS BEEN TOUCHED.OIL SEED   
 RAPE FROM A DISTANCE LOOKS VERY MUCH  
 LIKE MUSTARD BUT THERE IS QUITE A LOT 
 OF DIFFERENCE.THE PLANT COMES FROM THE
 CABBAGE FAMILY IT HAS LITTLE PODS ON  
 IT WHICH GROW TO ABOUT 4 CMS THEN WHEN
 THEY ARE RIPE IN THE PODS ARE VERY    
 LITTLE BLACK BALL BEARING LIKE        
 SEEDS.THE PLANT CONTAINS 40% OIL AND  
 IT GOES TO MAKE THINGS LIKE MARGARINE,</content>
