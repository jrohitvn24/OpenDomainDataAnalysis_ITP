    There are many farms around        
Lichfield. In Christ Church School's   
area there are three farms. Class 4    
wanted to find out what they were like 
so we visited them.                    
 The first one was called Ashmore      
Brook Farm and it was run by Mr Broome.
We found out that it was mostly a      
dairy farm. Our second visit was to    
Manor Farm at Farewell. This was an    
arable farm. The last visit was to     
Home Farm. It was a sheep farm. We     
were surprised to find out that the    
three farms were so different.
