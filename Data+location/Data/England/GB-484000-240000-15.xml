		<content> Linford Festival happens once a year. 
 It is a time when the people of Great 
 Linford get together for some fun. The
 Festival takes place in Great Linford 
 village. It always has a theme. This  
 year the theme was an English country 
 weekend. Children from Grt. Linford   
 Combined School had a fancy dress     
 parade on Friday 5th July 1985 to     
 begin the festival. They dressed as   
 nursery rhyme characters. The festival
 began with a cabaret in the ballroom  
 of Linford Manor on Friday evening, it
 had a 20's theme. On Saturday people  
 gathered on the village green and     
 paraded down the High Street. There   
 were lots of stalls, crafts, jewelry, 
 cakes,and toys were sold. A tombola   
 stall raised Â£160 for the school.On   
 Saturday evening there was a concert  
 in the church and a special open air  
 service outside the manor on Sunday.  </content>
