		<title>19The Crown Inn</title>
		<content> On Thursday we went down to the Crown 
 Inn to get some notes about the pub.  
 The first question we asked was did   
 they come to Blockley or were they    
 sent.They said they chose to come     
 because they thought it was a nice    
 place.                                
         The opening hours are 11.00   
 2.30 and from 7.00 to 11.00. On Sunday
 it is 12.00 to 2.00 and 7.00 to 10.30 
         The busiest days were Friday  
 and Saturday.                         
         They have not always been     
 publicans. They do alot of work before
 they open and after they close.They   
 would like to see a through road.They 
 think that would improve their trade. 
      They do sell food.The people that
 go there are mostly local and they do 
 have some tourists. To work in a pub  
 you have to be a hard working person  
 and as the landlord said "mad"!       </content>
