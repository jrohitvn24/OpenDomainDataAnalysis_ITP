		<content>  The 12th. Rubery Cub Pack consists of
 four sixes: Red, White, Green, Yellow.
 We meet at the Cub Hut at St. Chads'  
 Church every Thursday evening at      
 6.15 p.m. We play games, like crab    
 football, tracking, cat &amp; mouse, and a
 load more besides. We also go camping,
 and every year we go to Butlins       
 Holiday Camp.  ({J. Goode &amp; I O'Brien}
 )                                     
     Scouts is on a Thursday night     
 after Cubs. It starts at 7.15 p.m. and
 ends at 9.30 p.m. When you are changed
 you play games like Chinese Rice,     
 where two people are 'on' and they    
 have a sponge ball and it has to hit  
 you below the knees to get you out.   
     When you are {invested}you have to
 pay 35p. for subs. We some times go   
 onto the field and pitch tents. Every 
 year we go on camps to Barry Island   
 and Butlins ({D.Hayes})               </content>
