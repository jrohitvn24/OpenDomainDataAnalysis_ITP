		<title>20The School Day (Cont)</title>
		<content>   During mid morning break we play    
 football on the field I have my       
 friends with me and with our 'Mitre'  
 ball have a good game, we all play    
 fair even though there is no refree to
 see if there is fair play.            
   After break we change groups, lunch 
 is at twelve thirty which usually     
 consists of chips, vegetables and pie 
 and with a pudding of some sort. By   
 one fifteen we start school again     
 until three when the teacher reads us 
 a story, this term we have 'Empty     
 World' by John Christopher which is a 
 story of a boy left all alone in a    
 world where everyone has died of the  
 plague. At three thirty we go home.   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
