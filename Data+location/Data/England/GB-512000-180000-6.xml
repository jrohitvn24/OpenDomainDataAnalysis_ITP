   Mrs. Brechin gets up at about eight 
 o'clock. Shambles,the dog from        
 upstairs,comes down to see her.Mrs.   
 Brechin lives on her own, but her     
 family lives up-stairs. They visit her
 often. She usually goes shopping every
 day but her big shop is on Saturday.  
 She likes reading and writing. She has
 her own small garden which she likes  
 to take care of on her own. These     
 hobbies take up most of her time. She 
 has lived in Hanwell for seven years  
 and she likes where she lives because 
 it's near the town yet free and open. 
 She travels out of Hanwell about once 
 a year. She doesn't go to church. Her 
 most memorable time in Hanwell was    
 her eightieth birthday which was last 
 year.
