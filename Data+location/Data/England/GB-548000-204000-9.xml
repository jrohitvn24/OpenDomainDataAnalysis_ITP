		<title>09The Vicar</title>
		<content> The vicar has been in North Weald     
 since 1957. It is the only place he   
 has worked. He calls himself an odd   
 man because he is everywhere. He didnt
 always want to be a vicar. When he    
 knocks at peoples' doors they don't   
 always know him. The church gets      
 Â£7,000 a year. The church has been    
 there 650 years. If anything went     
 wrong and if something was replaced   
 and the vicar didn't like it, he      
 couldn't do anything about it because 
 what the Bishop says goes.
