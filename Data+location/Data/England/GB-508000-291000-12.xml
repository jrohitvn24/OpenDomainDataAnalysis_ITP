		<content> MY SUNDAY DINNER                      
 First dad cut a wing from the roasted 
 chicken brought home from his work.On 
 the plate I have peas which were      
 frozen when fresh,now boiled:also     
 fried potatoes with gravy made from   
 special powder.Mum buys these at the  
 village shop .Pudding is meringues    
 which are egg white and sugar whipped 
 with a fork,then cooked in the oven.  
                                       
 Another child writes about his        
 evening meal.....                     
                                       
 At 6 o'clock it's dinner time.We have 
 bacon fried in a pan,carrots cut in   
 rings cooked on an Electric cooker,   
 potatoes peeled and boiled in a pan   
 with water and then I have a cup of   
 coffee with milk.
