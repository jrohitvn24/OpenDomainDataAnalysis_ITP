		<title>11RISELEY NEWSLETTER(1)</title>

      The Riseley Village Newsletter is
 published six times a year,that is    
 every two months.  It consists,on the 
 average,of two sheets of printed type.
 It is typed by a village resident on a
 typewriter which cuts stencils.       
 Another Riseley person,who has his own
 buisness,and has an ink duplicating   
 machine,prints the newsletters.  My   
 familiy helps me with the boring task 
 of stapling the sheets together.      
      At the present time,four hundred 
 and five copies are distributed by a  
 team of eleven villagers,mostly women 
 at home, who enjoy the walk and a     
 chance to chat.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
