           Kids Today                  
 Kids today do not talk about specific 
 things.It is all a mixture of things. 
 Sometimes  we talk about fashion, the 
 latest crazes, new records, pop       
 groups, what you're doing tonight,    
 what was on television or jokes. When 
 we have conversations they can turn   
 into rows because of differences of   
 opinion.Sometimes we talk about       
 school,what teachers we like and hate,
 what lessons we like and hate.        
     When we are at school we sometimes
 discuss what lessons we have next. We 
 sometimes talk about things we do not 
 want to write down.
