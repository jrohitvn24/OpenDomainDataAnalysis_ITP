		<title>13Lifestyles in Eccleshall</title>
		<content> Once a market town, Eccleshall is     
 traditionally a meeting place for     
 country people and has a large number 
 of inns in relation to population.    
 Seven now remain, but the lack of     
 continuity in management in recent    
 years shows that it is increasingly   
 difficult for publicans to make a good
 living. All now provide bar snacks;   
 some have restaurants; and there is   
 one cafe. Although general wear is    
 country clothing, shopping facilities 
 have improved to the extent that local
 ladies have a choice of high-class    
 dress shops, hairdressers and beauty  
 salons. Strangely the gentlemen seem  
 sartorially neglected, but perhaps the
 local betting shop is some compens-   
 ation. Eccleshall typifies many       
 country towns: pleasant, friendly,    
 welcoming, with a wholesome and       
 enviable way of life.                 </content>
