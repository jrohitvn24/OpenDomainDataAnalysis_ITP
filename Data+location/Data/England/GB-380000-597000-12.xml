		<content> There are{six council houses}in the   
 village.The remainder of the housing  
 used to be{owned by}Lord Redesdale.Now
 he owns only 4 houses in the village  
 and one farm outside, letting these   
 except for one he uses as a holiday   
 home.There are two more weekend homes.
{The Ministry of Defence}owns several  
 houses and farms .                    
                                       
 Apart from 2 modern bungalows the     
{newest houses}are the council ones    
 built in 1947.The main body of housing
 in the village was built in the early 
{19th century.}Many farms are much     
 older, some having been there for 300 
 years.                                
 As the area is in the National        
 Park and also contains listed sites,  
{planning permission can be difficult }
 to obtain and refusals have been      
 encountered.                          </content>
