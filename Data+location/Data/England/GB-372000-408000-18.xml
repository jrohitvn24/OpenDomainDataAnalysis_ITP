		<title>18TYPICAL HOUSING</title>
		<content> Breightmet Hill was once one big house
 but it is now split into 3 terraced   
 houses. I live in the middle one of   
 the three. At the back there are 3    
 rooms downstairs. They are about 200  
 years old and two of them have beams  
 in them.The other 2 rooms are about   
 500 years old. The reason it is       
 different ages is because some of it  
 burnt down aboyt 200 year ago. The    
 attic had to be completely rebuilt as 
 did all but three of the bedrooms.    
 79 Burnmoor Rd. This dormer bungalow  
 has a big garden with swings. It has 3
 bedrooms and a bathroom. Two bedrooms 
  are upstairs and one down. The       
 windows are double glazed, and the    
 whole house has central heating. We   
 also have a gas fire in the lounge.   
 The garage and shed are joined, and   
 there is a greenhouse in the garden.
