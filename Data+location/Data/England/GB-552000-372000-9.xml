 There are not many arcades around     
 Chapel and Hogsthorpe. At Chapel St.  
 Leonards there is a little fair ground
 for children with little rides like   
 cages, aeroplanes, a bouncy castle and
 water lazers and mini motor bikes. In 
 Miller's arcade there's pop music and 
 a juke box but in Jimmy's arcade      
 there's Bingo for people and horse    
 riding machines. There's a Village    
 Hall and old people dance there for   
 one of the hobbies. In the back of    
 Miller's there's a pool room for      
 people of any age to go and play in.  
 Every year there is a Strawberry      
 Fayre.They have toys and Fancy dress,a
 ping pong ball game where you win a   
 fish if you get a ball in a jar. In   
 the Village Hall they sell tea and    
 cakes.Every week there is a dance for 
 old people.                           </content>
