		<title>02MARSDEN ROCK.</title>
		<content> Marsden Rock is a sea stack of        
 magnesian limestone, which can be     
 reached at low tide.It rises          
 vertically from the sea bed to a      
 height of 50m, and stands about       
 100m from the cliffs.                 
 For many years the rock has been      
 battered by the sea and waves and has 
 the appearance of a "triumphal arch"  
 with a cavern carved out of the rock  
 at sea level.                         
 On top of the rock a huge colony of   
 sea-birds nest all year round, making 
 this site the most important sea bird 
 colony in over 100 miles of coastline 
 from Yorkshire to the Farne Islands.  
 Marsden Rock is now a Nature Centre   
 run by the Royal Society for the      
 Protection of Birds.
