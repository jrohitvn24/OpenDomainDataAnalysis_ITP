		<title>03WESTON FARM</title>
		<content> A farm of over 500 acres stretching   
 northwards from Butser Hill parallel  
 to the A3 road and railway line       
{Crops &amp; Livestock:}200 acres of       
 wheat are grown, the rest of the farm 
 is grass.  There are 300 Friesian cows
 150 of which are being milked. {      
{Mechanisation:}5 farm workers, 5      
 tractors with a wide range of         
 implements and 1 combine harvester are
 based at the farm. {Social Concern:   
 Part of the farm buildings on the     
 south side of Weston Lane are ancient 
 and are covered by a preservation     
 order. The owners have applied for    
 planning permission to turn the barns 
 into 2 residential buildings with     
 outhouses, but local opinion is       
 against this. These barns were        
 designed for the horse and cart era   
 and ceilings are too low to allow     
 tractors inside.                      </content>
