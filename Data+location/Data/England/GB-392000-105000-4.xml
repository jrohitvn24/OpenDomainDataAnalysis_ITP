		<content>  MR HARDING THE OWNER HAD KINDLY GIVEN
 US PERMISSION TO ENTER HIS COPSE. IT  
 IS SO RAMPANT WITH TREES, CLIMBERS,   
 FLOWERS AND STINGING NETTLES, THAT WE 
 DECIDED TO STAY OUTSIDE.              
 WE WALKED AROUND THE EDGE &amp; RECOGNISED
 OAK, ASH, HOLLY, DOGWOOD, HAZEL,      
 HAWTHORN &amp; THE WAYFARING TREE.        
 SCRAMBLING UP &amp; OVER THE TREES WERE   
 BLACKBERRIES, DOG ROSE, HONEY-SUCKLE, 
 WILD CLEMATIS &amp; IVY. THE TREES WERE   
 MOSTLY SELF SOWN, CLOSE TOGETHER &amp;    
 FIGHTING FOR LIGHT. BROKEN BRANCHES   
 WERE LEFT LYING.                      
  THROUGH ONE GAP WE SAW AN AMAZING    
 SIGHT. TREES OF DIFFERING HEIGHTS,    
 COVERED WITH CREEPERS &amp; THE BLOOM OF  
 THE WAYFARER TREE. ALL APPEARING AS   
 SOLID AS A HILLSIDE STARRED WITH      
 FLOWERS.                              
                                       
                                       </content>
