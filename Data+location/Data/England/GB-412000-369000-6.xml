            At Beech Farm where we live
 and at one time was "The Black Bull"  
 public house,we have about seventy    
 five free range Warren hens which my  
 brother usually feeds.We sell the eggs
 to callers.We also retail from the    
 house about six acres of potatoes     
 planted in April and harvested in the 
 Autumn.This year we are growing Wilja 
 Pentland Crown and Romano.            
      Father also does some contract   
 baling of silage and hay for other    
 farmers.This helps to offset the      
 burden of ever increasing expenditure 
 on machinery.                         
      He employs two full-time and two 
 casual workers.All the secretarial    
 work is done by my mother.
