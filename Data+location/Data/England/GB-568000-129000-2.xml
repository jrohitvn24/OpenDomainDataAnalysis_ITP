		<content>    There are several families in      
 Ticehurst whose names go back for many
 centuries and are still remembered    
 either because of descendants or place
 names.  Some appear in the church like
 Sir William D'Ethyngham who gave money
 to build Ticehurst Church. His coat of
 arms is in the porch, azure, fretty   
 argent.The Courthopes' who go back    
 400 years, is argent, a fesse azure   
 between 3 estoiles of six wavy sable. 
    The Newingtons are another major   
 family, the first being Sir Adam born 
 in 1481. Dr.Charles Newington founded 
 Ticehurst House, a sanatorium which is
 open today. The family live at Oakover
 but the name is now Dreuce.           
    The Noakes family, now Reeves, live
 and farm at Overys. Pashley farm gets 
 its name from a Norman knight Robert  
 De Passele. The name Wybarne goes     
 back to John Wybarne who died in 1490.</content>
