		<content>      In 1928 Mr Eldridge bought a     
 haulage business.He had one           
 container.In 1968 Mr Eldridge sold the
 haulage business and went into        
 removals.There are five other people  
 as well as Mr Eldridge.They work from 
 seven thirty a.m.till five o'clock    
 p.m.from Monday to Friday.Most people 
 move if they're too old to live by    
 themselves,if their house is too small
 or too big.They are better paid than  
 they used to be.They are not allowed  
 to travel more than twelve hours per  
 house removal because the driver gets 
 too tired to drive any further.
