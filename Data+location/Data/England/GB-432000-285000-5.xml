		<content>{HOUSING}falls into 2 categories,rented
 &amp; owner occupied.The western area     
 contains more rented property;the     
 eastern is predominately owner        
 occupied.Housing near to Newdigate Pit
 (west of area) was built for the      
 miners.A few houses were built around 
 1900 when the pit opened, but the new 
 estate of 3-400 semi-detached houses &amp;
 flats was built by the National Coal  
 Board in the 1950's &amp; 60's.The council
 then purchased them &amp; now many people 
 are buying their homes &amp; doing        
 improvements like double glazing,gas  
 fires etc.Elsewhere there is a mixture
 of mostly private housing &amp; a few     
 council estates.There are many        
 semi-detached dwellings.There is a    
 contrast in older houses along        
 Coventry Road &amp; Newtown Road &amp; the    
 comparatively new estates eg.Cedars.  
 Building is still in progress.        </content>
