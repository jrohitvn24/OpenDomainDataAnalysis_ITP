interested in Tennis so I go to the    
club near my home.I go to school to be 
educated during the week.I start at    
9a.m. and work till 3.45p.m.My Mom is  
always in the house before I reach home
but my Dad arrives later.

been to a lot of places.               
Sometimes we go to my uncle's          
restaurant.He is Italian and lives in  
Penarth,South Wales.He gives us free   
meals.
