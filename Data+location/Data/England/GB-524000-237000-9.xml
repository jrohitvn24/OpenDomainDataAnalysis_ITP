		<title>09OTHER SHOPPING</title>
		<content> Most people in Ashwell and Newnham do 
 their main shopping outside the survey
 block. People tend to go to           
{supermarkets, hypermarkets or         
{furniture warehouses}in bigger towns, 
 buying enough groceries to last       
 for several weeks or taking advantage 
 of lower prices.                      
 Many people{travel 30-40 miles}to get 
 to the big shopping centres where they
 can buy clothes,jewellery,shoes etc.  
 They do this because there is{more    
{choice}and because it is often        
 cheaper.People told us thay they go to
 Cambridge, Bedford, Stevenage,Luton,or
 Peterborough for such shopping.Some go
 to London. On one of our survey days a
 delivery van from Harrods, the top    
 London store, called at one of the    
 farmhouses in Ashwell.                
 For this kind of choice you need good 
 transport ad good wages!!             </content>
