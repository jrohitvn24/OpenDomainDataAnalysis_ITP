		<content>   The Churnet Valley is rich in       
 wildlife and has a very varied        
 collection of trees,plants,and shrubs.
 However some species have declined and
 left the district including mute swans
 which were to be seen on the Caldon   
 Canal. About 80 species of birds have 
 been recorded in the area,including 9 
 members of the warbler family and 3   
 species of woodpecker. Redpolls and   
 siskins feed on Birches and Alder in  
 the winter, kinfishers are to be seen 
 on the canals.                        
   Many interesting plants, moths,     
 butterflies, dragonflies, and blue    
 damsel flies breed in the canal and   
 marsh. There is an improvement in the 
 pollution of the Churnet.The blue-grey
 slime which covered the bottom and    
 sides has now been removed with a     
 chemical which is harmless to fish and
 water plants. Fishing is now possible.</content>
