		<content>HOME LIFE:My name is Sarah.I live in a 
modern, 3 bedroomed, detached house    
with my mother, father and little      
brother.I go to school every day at 9  
o'clock and finish at 3 o'clock.At     
weekends I go to dancing class and     
have music lessons.My favourite food   
is steak.My favourite games are tig    
and stick-in-the-mud.                  
PLAY GROUPS:There are many play groups 
in the town.These are set up by the    
various housing estates and organised  
and run by volunteers.                 
HOLIDAYS:Bicester is a long way from   
the coast.The nearest seaside is       
Bournmouth.So, many children rarely    
get to the seaside.Every summer, the   
Round Table Organisation takes         
disadvantaged children away for a week.
