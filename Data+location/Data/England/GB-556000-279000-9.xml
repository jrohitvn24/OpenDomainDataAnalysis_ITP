		<content> Freight trains carry potatoes from    
 Scotland,fresh fruit and vegetables   
 from East Anglia and grain again from 
 East Anglia.Each container for grain  
 can take 58 tons.The fastest freight  
 train can travel at 75 M.P.H.but its  
 average speed is 60 M.P.H.The freight 
 trains come from Whitemoor Yard at    
 March which is their collecting       
 point.Three Signalmen work in         
 shifts.The shift hours are from 06.00 
 hours to 14.00 hours,14.00 hours to   
 22.00 hours and 22.00 hours to 06.00  
 hours.On Sundays two men work from    
 06.00 hours to 18.00 hours and from   
 18.00 hours to 06.00 hours.So that one
 of the three has a day off every third
 week.There is also a box lad who      
 answers the telephone and records the 
 trains' movements in a Log-Book.The   
 signalmen travel from Chettisham      
 and from Ely to work at Adelaide.     </content>
