		<content> We tried to find out how the          
 developments in{science}and technology
 have affected people here.We were     
 surprised to find that Mr.Hayllor's   
 dairy cows wear a transponder around  
 their necks like a collar.This gives a
 signal to a{computer}as the cows enter
 the milking parlour which in turn     
 checks the{cows}yield of milk and     
 adjusts the amount of processed food  
 nutrients given in each case.This     
 saves the farmer hours of time        
 checking on the milk yield of his herd
 and also gives him a sort of health   
 diagnosis for each animal.            
       Most people own digital watches 
 ,whose microprocessors keep time with 
 uncanny accuracy.Many people have     
 washing machines that are programmed  
 for different washes.Radio alarms help
 the{farmer}get up early in the morning
 when most of us are in bed.           </content>
