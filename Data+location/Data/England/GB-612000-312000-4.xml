		<content>     {'Ringland}is a peaceful village  
 about 7 miles from Norwich.There is a 
 river nearby where we can fish and    
 swim. There is a pub and a P.O. and a 
 church. On the valley's south side lie
{Ringland Hills}where we can sledge.   
 There are 2 commons and on the bottom 
 one are some horses. There used to be 
 many clubs in{Ringland,}but bingo is  
 the only one left.'(Catherine Tointon)
      'I get up at 7.45, have some     
 breakfast of toast or cereal, wash,   
 clean my teeth and make my bed by     
 pulling up my quilt. I get dressed,   
 tidy up and read until 8.50 when I    
 cycle to school which starts at 9.00  
 and finishes at 3.00. When I get home,
 I play with my friends and at 5.30 I  
 have tea (eg sausage, chips &amp; peas) &amp; 
 watch TV. At 6.30 I go to a gym club  
 in Norwich, come home at 10.00, clean 
 my teeth and go to bed.'(Anna Baker.) </content>
