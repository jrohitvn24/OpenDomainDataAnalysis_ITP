		<title>19Changes at Aston Hall</title>
		<content> Aston Hall was first used as the{manor
{house back in the 14th}century.It has 
 had many owners including Lords,Earls 
 and an Archbishop.The grounds are     
 marked by a ditch with a wall at the  
 top of the ditch.                     
  Since 1948 the Hall was called       
{Aughton Court Hospital}and was used as
 a home for mentally ill ladies.It has 
 fallen into a state of disrepair.     
  The police used the Hall as a hostel 
 during the{1984/85 miners' strike.    
  On 23rd March 1985{Firth and Pilling,
 the chemists,bought the Hall and hope 
 to turn it into a{private             
{convalescence home.                   
  There is a{preservation order}on the 
 building which stops changes being    
 made to the outside and parts of the  
 inside but they are allowed to repair 
 any damage.Mr Eades has been looking  
 after the Hall and dealing with it.   </content>
