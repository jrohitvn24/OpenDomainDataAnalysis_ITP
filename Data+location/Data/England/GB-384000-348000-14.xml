		<title>14RECREATION PORT VALE F.C.</title>
		<content> Port Vale Football Club is the only   
club in the Football League that is not
nnamed after the area that it is       
situated in.The ground is in Burslem,  
Stoke-on-Trent,but there is no such    
place as Port Vale.The team plays in   
the 4th Division.                      
                The team has never won 
a major honour,but it has good support 
averaging about 3,500 people per       
game,which is good for the 4th         
Division,and the fans are largely from 
the local area.They are very loyal,it  
is more like a family club.There is a  
local market based at the ground every 
week,and the players frequently visit  
our schools.                           
            Port Vale might not be the 
best team in the land,but it is a      
really sporting club.
