		<content>   First Schools are the first schools 
 we go to. We start when we are four   
 and we leave when we are nine. We     
 spend five years in first school. In  
 Cramlington there are 10 First Schools
 for the 2,540 younger children. They  
 were built between 1968 and 1984. 6   
 are heated by coal burning boilers.   
 The coal is fed into the boiler on an 
 endless belt. The other 4 schools burn
 natural gas from the North Sea.       
   Our favourite lessons at school are 
 Mathematics, Art and Swimming (at the 
 Leisure Centre). We stay with our     
 teacher all day, every schoolday for a
 year. There are about 32 children in  
 each class. We stay in school all day.
 A few children go home for lunch, most
 bring a packed lunch and some eat a   
 school dinner.
