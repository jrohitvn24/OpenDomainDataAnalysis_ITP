		<content> It stands latticed yet solid, at the  
 junction of the road leading back to  
 Froggatt Edge and on to the winding   
 Sheffield to Castleton road. The      
 latter promises the delights of       
 inspiring views as it meanders toward 
 Hathersage, and of the gentle         
 brooklands bubbling down through      
 Padley gorge toward Grindleford       
 station. For ease of reference we have
 named our area Longshaw, now a Country
 Park owned by the National Trust, of  
 which more is described later. The    
 Surprise, so called because of the    
 exciting views and vistas, is where   
 most of the visitors converge, with   
 many self made car parks having eroded
 the roadside grassland. Walking,      
 photographing and picnicking are      
 common but time and weather dictate   
 how long visitors stay in this area.
