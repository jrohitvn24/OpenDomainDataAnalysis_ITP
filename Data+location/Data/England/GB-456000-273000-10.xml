		<title>10  THE CYCLING PROFICIENCY</title>
		<content>                                       
     On Monday the first of July we did
our cycling proficiency test. We were  
tested by a policeman his name is      
P.C.Dunn. At first I thought I would   
not do it but I did. We did our cycling
test around our village. The policeman 
watched us as we rode our bikes on the 
road. After everyone had done that we  
went round the cones in the playground.
We also had road signs and questions to
do.Some of them were harder than others
but I did all of them and got 3 wrong. 
Then P.C.Dunn said that we had all     
passed.
