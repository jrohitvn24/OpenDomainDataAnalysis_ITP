		<title>13Village Life in Cople</title>
		<content>   We asked a staff member who lives in
 Cople  about  why  they  lived  in the
 village. She has lived in Cople for 14
 years  since  shortly  after   getting
 married.She likes village life because
 of the space, the country-side and its
 quietness.                            
                                       
   She says that village social life is
 not lively enough for her 2 daughters.
 She  would  also  like  to  see   more
 activities  in  the village. They find
 the  bus  services   inconvenient  and
 expensive.                            
                                       
   While the Post Office is very useful
 for  stamps,  she  thinks  the  choice
 of  grocery  items  limited, and their
 cost expensive. Having  a car she goes
 to a supermarket in Bedford.
