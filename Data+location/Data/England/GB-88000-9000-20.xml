		<content>{ LOCAL HISTORY}                       
 On the Garrison theres a castle called
 Star Castle which is in the shape of a
 star.It was built in 1593 and became a
 Hotel in 1933.Star Castle is a six    
 pointed star.Surrounded  by moat it   
 was a fortress within outer walls and 
 its ramparts contained ninety six     
 loopholes.Star Castles proper name is 
 Stella Marie (Star of Mary).The Queen 
 allowed Godolphin only Â£400 and the   
 whole operation cost less than        
 Â£1000.The granite walled fort has     
 withstood a siege in the              
 mid_seventeenth century,the effects of
 Star Castle were to warn off both     
 spaniards and would_be pirates alike  
 for until the civil war not a single  
 shot was fired against it in anger and
 Scilly now settled down to what       
 islanders hoped would be something    
 like normal life.                     </content>
