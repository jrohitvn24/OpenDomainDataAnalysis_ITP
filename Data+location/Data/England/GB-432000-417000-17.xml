		<content> This is a housing estate mainly of {  
{Council houses,}but some houses have  
 been bought from the Council by the   
 occupiers. Amenities are very few,    
 only 4 shops and a Public House, but  
 Wakefield town centre is not far away.
 Most estate children attend{Manygates 
{Middle School.}The nearby Grove Park  
 had a children's playground and an old
 folks' shelter, but these were        
 destroyed by{vandals.                 
 Near to the estate is the public area 
 of{Sandal Castle.}The Castle ruins are
 partly buried to preserve them for    
 archaeological purposes. The site     
 attracts many visitors who can see the
 site of the{Battle of Wakefield}fought
 in 1460.                              
 Very near to the Castle is {Sandal    
{Endowed Middle School. }
