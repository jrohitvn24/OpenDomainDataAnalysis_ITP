		<title>06Ecology of Melchbourne</title>
		<content> The area is still relatively unspoilt.
 Melchbourne Woods have been well      
 managed and a good deal of new tree   
 planting has taken place. The wood is 
 a mixture of coniferous and deciduous 
 trees. Lent Lillies, amongst other    
 wild flowers can be seen there.       
 The Bedford Natural History Society   
 spent an evening watching the bats and
 moths there.                          
 The lake in Melchbourne Park is a     
 breeding place for crested grebe,     
 pochard, tufted ducks and mallards.   
 There is a good mix of arable and     
 pasture land and many of the hedges,  
 small copses and ponds have been      
 retained, making the area a haven for 
 small mammals, insects and birds.     
 Badgers have been seen in the area.   
 The largest farm in the area,         
 Melchbourne Estate, is undertaking a  
 tree planting scheme.                 </content>
