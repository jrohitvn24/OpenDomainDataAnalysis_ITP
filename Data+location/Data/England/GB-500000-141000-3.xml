		<content>   In their spare time in Bramley, many
 people walk up to the lakes where it  
 is peaceful and quiet. They also jog  
 around these lakes on paths and along 
 the small stream near the High Street.
  There is not a cinema.There are two  
 public houses on the High Street as   
 well as an afternoon tea shop. There  
 is an old railway line which is very  
 popular for people who are walking    
 dogs or jogging. Chinthurst Hill is   
 another popular place for walking for 
 the people of Bramley.                
   Many golfers from Bramley play golf 
 at Bramley Golf Club and some people  
 in Bramley take up bell-ringing in the
 Church as a hobby on Sundays.         
   A few people own  horses in Bramley.
 Horse-riding is very popular as a     
 hobby here.
