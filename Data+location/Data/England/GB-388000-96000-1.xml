		<content>    This area is a typical example of  
 East Dorset farmland. Farming in      
 the area is both dairy and arable,    
 with some sheep.                      
    Of the five villages and hamlets,  
 three are named after the Winterborne 
 river, which is now rarely more than a
 stream, even in the wettest year.     
    The total population is between    
 200 and 250, with over half living in 
 Winterborne Zelston.                  
    Most of the working population are 
 farmworkers, but some commute to the  
 towns of Wimborne, Blandford, and the 
 Bournemouth-Poole area.               
    The A31, a major arterial route,   
 passes through the area from N.E. to  
 W., but avoids the settlements. As a  
 result, the area is peaceful and      
 'unspoilt'. Tourists are rarely seen, 
 but it's worth a day's visit if you   
 are a city dweller.(Sssh!).....       </content>
