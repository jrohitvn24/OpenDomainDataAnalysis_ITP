		<title>11AMENITIES AT HARDWICK</title>
		<content>  Perhaps one of the most startling    
 facts about this area is the almost   
 total{lack of amenities.}Apart from a 
{church}at Ault Hucknall,{Country Park 
 connected to Hardwick Hall, a{lighting
 firm at Hardstoft, the{Hardwick       
{Inn,}and a weekly{bread van}in some   
 areas, there are no facilities. Such  
 things as schools, medical and dental 
 surgeries and shops are all outside   
 the area. The lack of local public    
 transport perhaps intesifies this     
 although most residents have use of a 
 car.                                  
  However, this lack of facilities must
 be seen in the light of a very        
{small population.}Infact one square   
 kilometre of this area contained no   
 habitation whatsoever.                
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
