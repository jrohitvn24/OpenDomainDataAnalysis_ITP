FLORA                                  
In Maidstone Museum hangs a painting   
by Baxter of his beautiful daughter,   
called "Flora, The Gypsy Girl". A      
visitor named Frederick Saunders       
experienced a strange sadness or       
depression culminating in tears and a  
strong wish to flee the room. He never 
forgot the experience and painting     
and, finally, located the room again   
in 1940. The same emotion returned     
when he stood in a certain spot,       
looking at the painting. It is thought 
that she wants people who fully        
appreciate art and beauty to feel the  
sadness that someone so beautiful and  
young should die. It is the conscious  
part of her mind that lives on to      
haunt.                                 
                                       
                                       </content>
