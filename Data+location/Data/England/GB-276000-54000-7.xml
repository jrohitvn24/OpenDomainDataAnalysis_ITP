		<title>07Harbertonford Village 1</title>
		<content> The village of Harbertonford is not   
 very big but it is quite important.   
 There are about one hundred houses.   
                                       
 The village has a fairly large        
 district primary school which serves  
 several of the surrounding villages.  
 The school is very important because  
 it brings people together. A lot of   
 activities are based at the school in 
 the evenings and during the holidays. 
 These include a Cub scout pack, a     
 Brownies pack, badminton classes and  
 adult education classes.              
                                       
 In the village there are two shops and
 a Post Office.  These do quite a lot  
 of business as the nearest shopping   
 centre is Totnes, about three miles   
 away.
