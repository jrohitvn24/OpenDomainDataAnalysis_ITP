		<title>01PRUDHOE AREA</title>
		<content> The majority of houses in Prudhoe are 
 semi_detached. There are a few        
 bungalows and terraced houses. The    
 estates are mixtures of council and   
 private homes. All the houses have    
 gardens, most of which are large.     
 Prudhoe is adequately equipped with   
 buses and has five major services     
 running every half hour. Three of     
 these pass through the estates.       
 Front Street is the main street       
 running through Prudhoe, which is     
 easily accessed from the estates in   
 the town. Front Street has enough     
 shops to cater for most needs.        
 The land around Prudhoe is mostly     
 grassland used for grazing. The grass 
 is used for cattle, hay and silage. A 
 lot of land is also used for arable   
 crops, including barley and oilseed.  
 One farm supplies plants to nurseries.
