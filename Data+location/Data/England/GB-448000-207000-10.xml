		<content>  Oxfam is one of the main             
organisations for famine relief.Last   
year,1984,along with Blue Peter it     
raised over 50,000 pounds.It raises    
money by setting-up shops in different 
parts of the world where they sell     
second-hand clothes,shoes,books,records
jewellery and so on.                   
  Last year they raised money for      
Ethiopia and this year they're looking 
into raising money for Bangladesh in   
India.More than 25% of the money they  
bring in for famine relief is donated  
by the public.Some people just send in 
money,others organise fund-raising     
events.                                
  Oxfam originally started in Oxford in
1942 and has been going ever since.It  
has now become international.Oxford has
the main Oxfam office up in            
Summertown.In fact they have three     
different shops and offices in Oxford. </content>
