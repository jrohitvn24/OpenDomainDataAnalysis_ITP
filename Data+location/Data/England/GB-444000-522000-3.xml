		<title>03A Day in the Life.</title>
		<content> I am Lee Openshaw. On a typical day   
 for me I would get up at 7.30 and get 
 ready for school. Then I go downstairs
 and have my Frosties for breakfast. I 
 read the paper and watch TV-AM until  
 8.30. I leave for school and get there
 at 8.45 and play football until 9.00. 
 School starts then and we work until  
 10.30. Playtime - I play football     
 until 10.45. We work until 12.30 then 
 I have my dinner and play football    
 until 1.30. We work until 2.30 and    
 play until 2.45. We come back in and  
 work until 3.20. Then we tidy up and  
 go home at 3.30. I get changed and    
 when I'm ready I call for Ian and we  
 play until 5.45. I have my tea and    
 then practice my organ until 6.30. I  
 play out until 8.00 and watch         
 television until 9.30. Then I go to   
 bed at 10.00.                         
                                       </content>
