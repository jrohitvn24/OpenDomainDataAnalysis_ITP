		<content> Our D Block is situated in South      
 Warwickshire. The landscape is        
 undulating with the River Avon flowing
 through part of it. The area is mainly
 farm and market garden land.          
  There are small centres of population
 in the villages of Welford-On-Avon,   
 Weston-On-Avon &amp; Dorsington.          
  People travel to Warwick to work for 
 the computer firm I.B.M, to Stratford-
 upon-Avon  to work in the tourist     
 industry &amp; to Birmingham to work in   
 the city, others work locally on the  
 land.                                 
  Housing is very mixed ranging from   
 the very grand costing over Â£100 000  
 to a semi detached costing Â£30 000.   
  The fourth &amp; third year Juniors at   
 Welford-On-Avon School have undertaken
 this survey.
