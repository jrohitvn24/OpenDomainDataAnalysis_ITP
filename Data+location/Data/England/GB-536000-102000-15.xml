 Children play a variety of seasonal   
 playground games.  In Autumn conker   
 tournaments are popular as are tag and
 shadow tag. Children play marbles,    
 hop-scotch and 'it', skipping with    
 ropes, and many other games. In Forty 
 Forty Saves All a tree acts as a base 
 and one person stands beside it and   
 counts to forty-four while the others 
 hide; he or she then goes to search   
 for those hiding shouting 'Forty      
 Forty'. If one is spotted, the aim is 
 to get back to the base first. If     
 someone reaches the post without being
 noticed all players are freed.  Other 
 games include Kiss Chase; Pick-a-back 
 races; Wheel-barrow races, Hide and   
 Seek.                                 </content>
