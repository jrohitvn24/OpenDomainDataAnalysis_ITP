		<content> At the {BUCKNALL'S}they have a horse  
 called {NAUGHTY NIECE.                
{MR BUCKNALL}keeps partridges and      
 pheasants. He keeps the eggs warm in a
 thing that looks like a chest of      
 drawers.                              
 They showed us round their house but  
 just where most of the horsey things  
 were kept.                            
 They have chickens and chicks. We were
 allowed to touch one chick but we were
 not allowed to pick it up in case we  
 dropped it. They also keep ducks      
 there.  We saw some ducks in the cow  
 shed the cows only go in the cow shed 
 in winter.                            
 The {BUCKNALL'S}have two dogs called  
 WHISPER AND WINNIE  and a little puppy
 dog called {PEBBLE}who was everybody's
 favourite.
