		<content> COUNTRY LIFE.                         
 The beauty and peace of the rural     
 surroundings do not disguise many of  
 the problems of country life.The lack 
 of facilities, particularly shops is a
 major problem, particularly for the   
 elderly or those who do not own a     
 car.The nearest shops are in          
 Yate,5miles away, but a fishmonger    
 calls once a week,a baker twice       
 weekly and a general store daily. A   
 mobile library pays a weekly visit.   
 Most shopping for clothes, furniture  
 etc is done either in Bristol or Bath.
  The children go to Chipping Sodbury  
 to school,the nearer school at Wapley 
 closed down a few years ago. From the 
 more prosperous homes the children go 
 to boarding schools.                  
  Like the elderly ,the children's     
 lives are restricted by their lack of 
 mobility.                             </content>
