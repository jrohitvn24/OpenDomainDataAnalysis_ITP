		<title>06Modern Farming</title>
		<content>  Farms used to keep all sorts of      
animals and grow a variety of crops.   
Now, to make a living, farmers have to 
specialise in just one sort of farming.
  Round Kingsley the farming is mainly 
dairying. The cows are mainly Fresians 
(or a Fresian-Hereford cross) which    
give a lot of milk - about 50 litres a 
day. Some grass is left to grow for    
hay, which is cut with a forage        
harvester in June. Other crops are not 
usually grown. Manure from the cows is 
run into slurry pit, and this is put on
the fields with a slurry spreader.     
  Milking is all done by machines in   
milking parlours. Tanker lorries       
collect the milk each day. Some farmers
use a computer to calculate the exact  
feed needed by each cow, and to analyse
the quality of the milk.
