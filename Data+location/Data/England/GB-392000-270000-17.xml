		<title>17CHANGES IN PATTERNS OF TRADE</title>
		<content>    Despite efforts by the district    
 council to attract traders and        
 customers, Bromsgrove in the 1980's   
 has seen a sharp change in the range  
 and character of shops and business   
 premises.  Empty shops, frequent      
 changes of tenure and major changes in
 the use of buildings in High Street   
 testify to the difficulties resulting 
 from economic recession and           
 competition from the new shopping     
 centre in Redditch.  Furniture stores,
 menswear shops, butchers' and         
 supermarkets have all closed, while   
 banks have flourished and building    
 societies have increased in number.   
{"Shop to Let"}signs are commonplace.  
 Even the council offices are for sale 
 as they are removed to the now        
 redundant college of education        
 buildings.
