		<title>10EAST LEAKE BANTAMS F.C.</title>
		<content> The club was formed in 1974 and has a 
 membership of boys between the age of 
 9 and 16.                             
 There are seven teams,each with its   
 own manager.All the managers are      
 volunteers who give their time freely.
 Some of the teams are sponsored by    
 local people.                         
 Matches are played mainly on Sunday   
 mornings but training,under           
 floodlights at the British Gypsum     
 Plaster Board ground,takes place once 
 per week.                             
 The club has been most successful,not 
 only in winning leagues and cups,but  
 in maintaining a high membership.     
 The ground used contains two pitches, 
 has a pavilion and is rented from the 
 council.                              
 The members of the club live,not only 
 in East lEake,but in the area         
 surrounding the village.              </content>
