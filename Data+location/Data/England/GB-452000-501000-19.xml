		<content> The area contains many disused jet    
 mines. In the village of Great        
 Broughton, some two miles to the North
 is a pub called The Jet Miners to     
 which the buyers would come from      
 Whitby. Intensive mining for coal, jet
 and alum occurred during the          
 nineteenth century along the 900 ft   
 contour leaving piles of shale which  
 remain barren still. The field system 
 in square 4 is reputed to be where the
 miners used to keep their horses. Jet 
 occurs in irregular lumps and pockets 
 and was often found - if it was to be 
 found at all - at the bottom of alum  
 mines. There were several alum works  
 nearby. Fossils are to be found in the
 disused quarries, and on the North    
 face of Cringle Moor inscriptions and 
 a face are carved. At least one farm  
 has provided bed and breakfast to     
 people come in search of fossils.     </content>
