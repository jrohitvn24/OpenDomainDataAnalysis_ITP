		<title>11Pig farming</title>
		<content>     The{pig unit}is on Moss Colliery  
 Road. It has been in existence for    
 twenty-one years and has eight        
 hectares of land,{mainly grassland.   
     They chose to set up business here
 because their original site was       
 damaged by fire and this was the best 
 site available.                       
     The unit has{three hundred pigs,  
{twenty-two cows}and{a few hens.}The   
 pigs are kept in pig sties and are not
 bred on the farm but are bought in.   
 they are kept for five to seven months
 before being sent to{slaughter}for    
 butchers to provide{bacon}and{pork.   
     Two people are employed on the    
 farm and they work a thirteen hour day
 and work seven days a week.           
     About three times a year the      
{Ministry of Agriculture}come to check 
 the farm to see it is up to standard, 
 they always arrive unannounced!       </content>
