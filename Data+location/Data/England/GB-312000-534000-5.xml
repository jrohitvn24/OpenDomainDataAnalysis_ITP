		<title>05LANDSCAPE at Blindcrake</title>
		<content>   Blindcrake is situated in a geolog- 
 ically interesting area on the North  
 Western edge of the Lake District     
 National Park. Surrounding rocks      
 include limestone and basalt as rev-  
 ealed in Ghyll Yeat.                  
   The field system goes back hundreds 
 of years as evidenced by their long,  
 narrow nature. This situation is not  
 likely to change in the forseeable    
 future as the 12 local farms do not   
 own adjacent fields but appear to have
 them scattered at random!             
   High ground (over app.160 m) remains
 uncultivated and is used as rough     
 grazing although the limestone quarry,
 NGR 148362, is eating into a large    
 area. There are several old limekilns 
 in the area and their associated      
 quarries, (best preserved at NGR      
 142343, 159353 and 144357).
