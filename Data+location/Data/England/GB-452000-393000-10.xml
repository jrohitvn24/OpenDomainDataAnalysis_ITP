		<content> Magpie wood is a small private        
 woodland, once part of one large      
 woodland area together with Stainton  
 Little Wood, owned by Mr.J.C.Raper of 
 Wilsic Lodge Farm. It comprises of    
 mainly sycamore, ash and young elm    
 trees, a few evergreens with beech and
 hawthorn at the edges. It is overgrown
 with brambles and bracken. There is a 
 small variety of common flowers-red   
 campion, pignut, bluebell, speedwell, 
 nettles. Magpies and swifts nest      
 nearby. Insects seen-slugs, ladybirds,
 woodlice, spiders. The Braithwell area
 has many well-used footpaths and      
 bridleways linking the villages. One  
 is known locally as Granny Grindle's  
 lane. A most picturesque walk across  
 the fields to Clifton (Highest Point) 
 and Micklebring is a treat not to be  
 missed.
