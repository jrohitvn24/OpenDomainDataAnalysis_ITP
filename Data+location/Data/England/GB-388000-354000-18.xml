		<title>18Theatre in Knypersley.</title>
		<content> Theatre productions in Knypersley are 
mainly centered upon the High School.In
recent years the pupils have presented 
productions ofThe Mikado,Fiddler on the
Roof and South Pacific,which was the   
most recent.South Pacific ran for six  
consecutive nights, with an audience   
of  approximately two hundred per      
night.The tickets were not sold to the 
general public despite a great         
demand.The lead of Nellie Forbush was  
played by pupil Helen Clarke who,as    
a result,wishes to  persue a career in 
drama.The male lead  was played by     
language teacher Roger Blenkinsop.The  
director was English teacher Eileen    
Elkin.                                 
  Park Middle School has also presented
such productions as The Wizard of      
Oz.These do not receive the same       
amount of support commanded by High    
School Productions.                    </content>
