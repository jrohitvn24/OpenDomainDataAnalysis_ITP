		<title>01Farmland south of Wykeham</title>
		<content> An intensively farmed area along the  
 flat valley bottom of the Derwent     
 River. Fields are large and mostly    
 arable although quite a lot of land   
 is used for grazing stock.            
 Nearer Wykeham the ground is slightly 
 more hilly and less fertile and used  
 mainly for grazing or rough grazing.  
 There are many plantions, coniferous  
 and deciduous scattered about as      
 well as some semi natural deciduous   
 woodland.                             
 Residents are mostly involved in      
 farming and live in a scattering of   
 farms, there being no villages. Access
 is limited to minor roads and tracks  
 and  the scenery attracts few         
 visitors. There is a busy sand and    
 gravel pit providing some jobs in the 
 block at Pheasant Lodge. There is some
 parkland and the remains of an Abbey  
 near Wykeham.                         </content>
