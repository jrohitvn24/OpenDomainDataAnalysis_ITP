   When we went to the Estate Agents   
the Manageress answered our questions. 
We found out that before it became the 
Estate Agents it was a hairdressers.   
The busiest day is Saturday. Second-   
hand houses sell the most and all ages 
buy them. The dearest house costs      
#300,000. The most popular areas for   
houses are Otford and Shoreham.        
                                       
                                       
   On July 10th. we went to the Spar   
Shop. One of the owners answered our   
questions. The building is 53 years old
and has been in the same family all    
that time. They do get a few           
shoplifters. The  Manager lives above  
the shop. They deliver groceries and   
there are five people employed there.  
They get their supplies from "Cash and 
Carry". Stock comes in on Fridays.     </content>
