		<content>fabric is cotton, as in all the        
clothes shops.  The shop attracts      
people because its prices are          
reasonable. There aren't many          
childrens' clothes shops.  Badgers     
sells mens' clothes. Didcot has lots   
of hairdressers.  Of the two main      
ones, Didcot Hair Stylists and         
Broadway Cut-in, the former may have   
30 customers daily.  On averaga about  
15-20 people go to Broadway Cut-in     
each day.  Next door is a Barber's     
shop. Didcot has three chemists,       
Boots, Savory &amp; Moore and G.K.         
Chemists.  The most popular one is     
Boots. They all sell some medicines    
without prescription and some only     
when the pharmacist is around.  In     
winter the most popular medicine is    
cough mixture and in the summer it is  
hay fever tablets and all of the year  
round they sell pain killers mostly.   </content>
