		<content>   This area is mostly{sloping hillside
 land.The path which we followed from  
 the top of the{New Incline}used to be 
 a railway track from the{mines}and we 
 could still see{ruined buildings}and  
 sidings.Nearly all the time we were   
 walking there were trees around       
 us.These were mostly{deciduous}with a 
 few{conifers}amongst them.In the wood 
 we saw a{mine entrance}which had been 
 blocked off and a bit further along   
 was another{disused mine}.We came to  
 a sandstone bridge which crossed a    
 track and turned to climb up a rough  
 track which took us through woodland  
 to the top of the hill.Here we saw    
{farmland}and small areas of conifers. 
 In one field there were{sheep.}In the 
 other there were{cows and calves}of   
 mixed breed and a large{white bull. }
