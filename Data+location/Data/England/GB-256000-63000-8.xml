		<content> A Natural. Open moor rises to fissured
 granite outcrops called tors. The     
 slopes under the tors are covered with
 boulders called clitter. The river    
 Plym bisects the area and has numerous
 rough, stony hummocks in its valley   
 caused by ancient tin workings.       
                                       
 B.Farm. The fields are small with     
 stone walls or boundary banks         
 indicating that the settlements are   
 not recent.                           
                                       
 C.Industrial. The sides of the waste  
 tips and mica pans are partially      
 landscaped. Where the tipping or      
 banking has finished, the china clay  
 waste is coated with soil and seeded  
 with suitable plants which bind the   
 surface, stopping erosion and vastly  
 improving the appearance as seen from 
 the road.                             </content>
