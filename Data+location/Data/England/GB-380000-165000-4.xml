{Chapel Plaister}is raised up on a     
 hill,and right beside the road,but    
 many people don't even know it's      
 there!The chapel got it's name        
{"Plaister"}from the{recreation space  
 alongside it.Animals were kept and    
{maypole dances}held there.The Chapel  
 was built in 1360 over a stone        
 quarry,and with stone from the        
 quarry.It was built for{pilgrims}to   
 come in and rest on the way to        
{Glastonbury}Abbey.Services were held  
 there every day in the morning and    
 evening.There is a{tunnel}leading to  
{Hazlebury Manor}about 600 metres away.
 The Chapel has two{Basqueville Bibles 
 which are over 200 years old.There was
 a{bell}hanging on a tree opposite the 
 Chapel which was rung for services.   
 Today services are held only          
 occasionally.                         </content>
