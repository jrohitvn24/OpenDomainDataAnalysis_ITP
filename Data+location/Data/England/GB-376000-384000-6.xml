		<title>06PHOTOGRAPH STUDY:REFLECTIONS</title>
		<content>   One group of students played a major
 role in deciding what was to be       
 photographed and after the painful    
 task of choosing four slides for      
 inclusion in the Project felt that    
 some mention of the difficulties      
 experienced in photographing was      
 needed. This is a quiet and flat area 
 and so some of the initial guidelines 
 proved difficult to carry out. There  
 are no high vantage points and apart  
 from two tiny shopping areas the      
 streets, mainly of housing, seemed    
 always to be empty. It proved         
 difficult to photograph people at work
 and no festival existed. Many of the  
 slides were dull and repetitive shots 
 of lonely houses, dull shops, distant 
 motorway or lively corn in huge       
 fields. Nevertheless this was a       
 worthwhile study and gave an insight  
 into and understanding of the area.   </content>
