		<content> Cragside was once the private home of 
 Lord Armstrong but it is now in the   
 care of the National Trust and is open
 to the public.                        
 It is a nineteenth century building   
 which stands on the hillside to the   
 north east of the village. It stands  
 in a woodland setting with many       
 rhododendrons.                        
 The house can be seen from our school 
 field and in June the rhododendrons   
 are very colourful.                   
 Inside the house you can see an       
 old_fashioned kitchen, different      
 inventions and many valuable items.   
 In the grounds there are interesting  
 walks so it is wise to park your car  
 and explore them. you will find the   
 lakes and an adventure playground.    
 They recently opened a classroom for  
 visiting schools above the old stable 
 block and we were first to use it.    </content>
