		<title>10Games Children Play</title>
		<content>     When I was young there were many  
games we used to play such as Red      
Rover,Kerbie,Kick the Can and Hospital 
tick.                                  
     All of these games were very      
entertaining.Here are simple rules for 
each of the games.                     
     Red Rover-there were two teams to 
start off with,each team had to stand  
in a line and hold hands.One team then 
nominated a person from there team to  
run across and break through the       
 barrier of arms of the opposite team. 
Whe this person was nominated the other
team had to chant"Red Rover,Red Rover  
we call(name of person) over."         
     Kerbie-this was played by two     
people and a ball.Each person had to   
stand on the kerb(one person each side 
of the street).You then had to throw   
the ball at the kerb opposite to you.
