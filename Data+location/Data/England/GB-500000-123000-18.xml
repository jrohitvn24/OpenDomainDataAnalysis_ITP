		<content> On retirement, tenant farmers are     
 offered the use of an estate cottage, 
 unless they can buy one for           
 themselves. One farmer's wife         
 complained of a shortage of available 
 cottages, so many being bought by     
 townspeople, as country homes. Being  
 tenants, farming families tend to     
 furnish with only moveable goods, and 
 the almost universal double glazing,  
 is absent in the farmhouses, despite  
 grumbles about the cold. It is not    
 moveable! The older generation is well
 cared for by both tenant families and 
 those in private houses. At a cottage 
 near one farm, elderly parents in     
 their late eighties are constantly    
 visited by their children, who do all 
 their shopping. At a much bigger      
 private house, a bungalow has been    
 built for the parents, who are equally
 well cared for.                       </content>
