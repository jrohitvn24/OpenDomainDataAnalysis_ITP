		<title>09Guy Fawkes and Catesby</title>
		<content>  One of the most important aspects of 
Ashby's local history was its          
involvement in the gunpowder plot of   
1605. Guy Fawks and Robert Catesby led 
a group of 8 plotters hoping to blow up
 arliament, kill King James, and       
restore England to the Catholic        
religion. Their plan was foiled by     
guards who searched the cellars of     
parliament.                            
  It is believed that the plotters made
their plans in Robert Catesby's manor  
house which still stands near the      
church in Ashby.The plotters room is   
in the gatehouse over the main entrance
to the manor house.                    
  The manor house is still in private  
lands and it is not open to the public.
