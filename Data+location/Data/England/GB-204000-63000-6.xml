 day is produced in the milking parlour
 which takes 16 cows a time. 2 men milk
 twice daily.                          
   The milk is cooled, stored in tanks 
 and delivered to Lostwithiel creamery 
 each morning.                         
   The cattle eat grass in summer and  
 silage and hay in the winter. This is 
 supplemented by special pellets which
