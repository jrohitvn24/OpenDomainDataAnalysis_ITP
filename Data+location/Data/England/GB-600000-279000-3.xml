		<content>   Garboldisham,{(GARBLESHAM),}possibly
 originated as "Garibaldi's Hame",     
 Garibaldi being a Dane. Prewar the    
 Montgomrie family owned the scattered 
 group of numbered and landed estate   
 cottages which sold for Â£48000 in     
 1944. There is now a mix of old and   
 new with names and numbers in cheerful
 chaos. There is an  unobtrusive modern
{ESTATE}but other dwellings are strung 
 out like a looped necklace, bounded by
 pasture and farmland. Six clay lump   
 council houses are to be redeveloped. 
 School, Church, V.Hall and Pub. are   
 centrally located. The village (600+) 
 is quartered by intersecting roads    
 (A1066,B1111) but remains well        
 integrated. Local groups flourish,    
 making good use of two halls. Part of 
 the village comes into a{CONSERVATION 
 area and there is a rigid{'BUILDING   
{ENVELOPE'}which limits development.   </content>
