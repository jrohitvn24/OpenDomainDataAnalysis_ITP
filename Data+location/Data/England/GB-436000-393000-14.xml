		<content> change comes over the landscape.The   
 Droppingwell Conservation Project has 
 now been officially opened by local   
 councillors. This once waste_land has 
 been cleared of debris and rubbish:   
 over 20 tons of refuse,household and  
 industrial were cleared between 1979  
 and 1984 by local school children.    
 Droppingwell Lane has consequently    
 become one of the prettiest stretches 
 of road in South Yorkshire.           
 Magpies,Jays,Crows and even kestrels  
 have been observed. Several           
 varieties of butterfly can be seen in 
 the summer months fluttering around   
 the hedgerows and trees lining the    
 road. Blackburn school has a superb   
 environmental area with a great       
 variety of wild flowers, shrubs       
 and bushes. Poppies are in flower now 
 and sparkle like rubies amongst the   
 greenery.                             </content>
