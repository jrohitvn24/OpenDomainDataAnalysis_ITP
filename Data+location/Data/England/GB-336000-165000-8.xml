		<content> The private moter car is essential for
 coming and going in the village.Young 
 people often ride motorbikes or       
 bicycles.This can make essential trips
 to shops or doctors very difficult    
 for the elderly or very young who     
 cannot drive.The community spirit in  
 villages,however, means that lifts are
 nearly always available.              
 Wick St. Lawrence has a bus on        
 Tuesdays and Thursdays, which makes   
 one trip to Weston Super Mare and     
 returns.It is a private coach subsid- 
 ised by the local authority.          
 The M5 motorway built in the 1960's   
 skirts the edge of Wick St. Lawrence. 
 the nearest access and exit point is  
 at St.Georges about 1\ miles away.    
 In the first half of the twentieth    
 century a light railway ran from      
 Weston Super Mare to Clevedon with    
 halts in both villages.               </content>
