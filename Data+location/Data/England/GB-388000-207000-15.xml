		<title>15An interesting resident (2)</title>
		<content>  For company she has 5 dogs and 9     
 cats. Her water is drawn from a nearby
 spring and for light and heat she uses
 paraffin.She says she doesn't miss    
 electricity,particularly as a         
 childhood friend was killed by a      
 faulty electric iron.The Daily        
 Telegraph comes by post and recently a
 telephone was installed.Shopping is a 
 problem because of the lack of public 
 transport;normally a van gives her a  
 lift into Stroud and she gets a taxi  
 back.Provisions have to be dragged    
 down to the house by trolly.The local 
 priest visits once a month for        
 Communion.In the winter she is often  
 snowed in for days.                   
 Wildlife abounds and "the birds sing  
 like a benediction".There is a great  
 deal of shooting and poaching.On one  
 Remembrance Sunday she couldn't follow
 the radio service because of the guns.</content>
