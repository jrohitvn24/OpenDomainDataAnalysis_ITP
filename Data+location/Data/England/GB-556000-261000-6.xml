		<title>06SWAFFHAM PRIOR'S CONCERT</title>
		<content> After many weeks of rehearsal,        
 Swaffham Prior Community Primary      
 School held a concert in St Mary's    
 Church in July 1985. The concert was  
 in 2 sections and began at 7pm. The   
 first items were given by the infants 
 who gave a selection of singing and   
 verses on the subject of holidays,    
 with the sea playing a major part. The
 second part of the concert was given  
 by the juniors who performed Joseph   
 and his Amazing Technicloured         
 Dreamcoat. This consisted of singing  
 and dance routines and was accompanied
 by piano, drums, bass guitar and 2    
 ordinary guitars. The evening was very
 well supported by parents and friends 
 and at the end a presentation was made
 to the music teacher. She was given a 
 plant called Joseph's. A collection   
 afterwards made Â£57.32 for the        
 Ethioapian Appeal.                    </content>
