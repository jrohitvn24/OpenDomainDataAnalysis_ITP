		<title>01INTRO TO WOMERSLEY AREA</title>
		<content> Most of the area is very flat and     
 low-lying and consists of Arable      
 farmland,however,there is a quarry    
 being worked close to Womersley,which 
 is the only village in the area.      
 All the farms in the area concentrate 
 on Arable farming,each with roughly   
 the same amount of land.              
 There is also a dismantled railway    
 line passing through,which used to go 
 to Little Smeaton.                    
 As most of the industry is farming,the
 population is low,and most of the     
 people work outside the area.         
 Around the village of Womersley,a lot 
 of the houses are privately owned     
 providing a quiet residential area for
 the owners.                           
 All the roads are{B}roads,and farm    
 tracks.There are no {A}roads.         
                                       
                                       </content>
