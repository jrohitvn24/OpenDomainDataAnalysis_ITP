		<title>07MORRIS DANCING IN ABINGDON</title>
		<content>Morris Dancing started in Abingdon in  
about 1560 in The St. Helen's Street   
area. Abingdon Morris Dancers won the  
head of an ox in 1700 from another     
team  of dancers from the Vineyard     
area of the town, when a fight         
developed after a dancing competition. 
Abingdon Morris Dancers could be the   
oldest out of about 300-400 groups in  
England.  Each year a new Mayor of Ock 
Street is elected.  He is taken up and 
down Ock Street in a chair.  In his    
hand he would have a cup of beer which 
all the Morris Men drink out of.  The  
cup is 300 years old and it is called  
the Ock Street Mace, it is made of real
silver.  The Mayor also carries a sword
that is 50 years old.  Mr. Argyle is   
the Mayor of Ock Street and he says    
who the leader of the Morris Men will  
be.  Only Ock Street residents are     
allowed to vote.By Matthew Spraggs(11).</content>
