 We also have two dogs,a cat and six   
 goldfish.The dogs always break things 
 up in the house.In the morning my dad 
 is the first person to get up,then the
 rest of us get up.We have four meals a
 day.Our household appliances are a    
 cooker,fridge,tumble drier,hoover and 
 a spinner.My dad's hobby is gardening.
 Mine is watching television.We have   
 one car which my Dad uses for work.We 
 don't go on holiday but we go on      
 outings quite often.We wear lots of   
 fashionable clothes in our family.    
 There are a lot of jobs to do around  
 the house.I get on with my parents but

 special occasions like                
 Christmas,Easter and birthdays.
