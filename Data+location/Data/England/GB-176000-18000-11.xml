		<title>11PUBLIC TRANSPORT</title>
		<content> The village is poorly served by public
 transport.With the exeption of the    
 daily buses and taxis provided during 
 term time by the Local Education      
 Authority for the conveyance of       
 children to their schools there are   
 only{two}return bus journeys each week
 between{Coverack and Helston.}A taxi  
 service is available from the local   
 garage. The garage is also able to    
 provide a mini-bus or coaches for     
 larger paries and for transport to    
 special events, such as organised     
 theatre parties, special shopping     
 trips, etc.                           
 Most householders consider it         
 essential to own a car or other form  
 of{personal transport,}and this       
 is most necessary for working people, 
 who have no option but to provide     
 their own transport to their places of
 work.                                 </content>
