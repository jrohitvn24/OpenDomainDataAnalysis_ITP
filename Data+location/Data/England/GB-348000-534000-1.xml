		<content>  The land we have been surveying is   
 mostly farm land.A motorway,the M6,and
 a railway run through our             
 rectangle.Almost 50% of our           
 rectangle consists of intensively     
 managed  grassland although some of   
 our rectangle was on Won Fell to the  
 east which was mostly rough           
 grazing.The railway,motorway and A6   
 run N to S following the line of the  
 valley but the A6 runs on slightly    
 higher ground E of both.In the middle 
 squares is Plumpton Hall on the banks 
 of the river Petteril which runs into 
 the Solway Firth near Carlisle.In the 
 W squares are the London to Glasgow   
 railway and motorway.The highest point
 is 271m above sea level,the lowest is 
 126m.Carlisle is to the N,Blencathra  
 to the S/W,the Pennines to the S/E.{
