		<content>The rector of All Saints Church,       
Gazeley is the Rev. Andrew Platt. He   
has been there for 6.5 years, and has  
several pets which he shares with his  
family, namely a cat, a dog and a      
goldfish. The Platt family are very    
good musicians playing guitars, piano, 
flute and auto-harp. Gazeley church was
built around 1400 and is part of the   
reformed Deanery of Moulton, Gazeley,  
Kentford and Dalham, part of the       
Diocese of Midenhall of which the Rev. 
Platt is Rural Dean. A service is taken
in each church every Sunday. The rector
also looks after Brandon, Beck Row,    
Midenhall and Newmarket. A rota of     
ladies clean the church which can seat 
200. There are a few roses and trees in
the chuchyard. The Youth group meets   
regularly. A flower Festival is held   
each year for fund raising.
