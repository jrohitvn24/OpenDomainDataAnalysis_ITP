		<title>01    Background to the area.</title>
		<content>This rural area is on the edge of the  
Cotswolds, near Witney, Oxfordshire,   
in   the valley of the River Windrush. 
It includes  the ancient villages      
of Cogges and S. Leigh. Until recently 
Cogges was a village in its own right, 
separated from the town of Witney      
by the river and ancient water meadows 
Witney is now expanding and Cogges is  
rapidly becoming a part of Witney.     
There is much new housing development, 
both of private and council estates,   
with a variety of styles, materials and
sizes although  emphasis is on small   
homes rather than on luxury development
 The small village of South Leigh still
exists separately as a quiet, rural    
village but also relies on Witney for  
shops and services. It still has a pub!
Farming is mixed but the emphasis is   
changing from a predominance of dairy  
farming to more cereals, oilseed rape. </content>
