		<content> The affairs of the parish are         
 administered by a Parish Council      
 comprised of nine elected members and 
 a paid clerk without voting rights.   
 It operates under the jurisdiction of 
 the West Norfolk District Council, the
 local authority responsible for all   
 public services in this community.  A 
 proportion of the rates collected by  
 the authority is returned to the      
 Parish Council to be spent at local   
 level.  The powers of the Parish      
 Council are very limited and although 
 it is able to advise and make         
 recommendations to the district       
 council, the final decisions are      
 always taken at district level.       
 The Parish Council does provide a     
 means by which local residents can    
 raise issues of immediate concern for 
 public discussion and action.
