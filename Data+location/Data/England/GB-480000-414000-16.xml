		<title>16Sarah's life in Eastoft</title>
		<content> On Saturday I get up at 9am and have  
 breakfast then play tennis in the     
 square with friends. The boys play    
 cricket in people's yards or go on the
 BMX course opposite my house.         
 Sometimes my family go shopping on a  
 Saturday to Scunthorpe because our one
 shop only sells sweets,cereals and    
 frozen things.                        
  We have a bus stop with a seat in it 
 and a village green with seats on it. 
 The owner cuts the grass every six    
 weeks and there is a telephone box on 
 it.There is also a war memorial.      
  The school is next to the church so  
 the children can practise hymn singing
 for special occasions.                
  Near the school is a new village     
 hall,-we use it for entertainment like
 parties and discos for the children   
 and the W.I uses it every other       
 Wednesday.                            </content>
