		<title>18Buxhall - The Playing Field</title>
		<content> The playing field in Buxhall provides 
 open space for children and village   
 events although little used for formal
 sports. It is used by the{local foot- 
{ball club,}playing in the Bury Sunday 
 League, once a fortnight Sept/April.  
 The club has 18 playing members, of   
 whom only 3 live in the village.      
 The{provision of a pavillion}is being 
 discussed. It could be a catalyst for 
 other activities eg cricket, bowls. A 
 local architect has prepared estimates
 ranging from Â£6000 for self-build     
 changing rooms to Â£17000 for a larger 
 professionally built construction.    
{Other events on the field in 1985:    
 children's party, November fireworks  
 and bonfire, and Buxhall Historic     
 Fair. This was organised by an ad hoc 
 village committee and included a steam
 engine/veteran vehicles rally, flower,
 produce and dog shows.                </content>
