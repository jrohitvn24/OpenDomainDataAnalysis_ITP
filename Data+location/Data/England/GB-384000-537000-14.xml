		<content> There is a Post Office at Wearhead but
 no longer at Ireshopeburn, pensioners 
 there having to travel to Wearhead or 
 St.John's Chapel. Postal deliveries   
 vary from 6.45a.m. to afternoon, dep- 
 ending on the van's route. Most houses
 have a private telephone, though some 
 still share a party line. There are   
 public kiosks at Wearhead and         
 Ireshopeburn that work most of the    
 time. Most families have a car but    
 there is a good reliable bus service  
 which makes the return journey from   
 Stanhope to Cowshill 10 times a day.  
 On Wednesdays and Saturdays special   
 buses run direct from Stanhope to     
 Newcastle. Pensioners are issued with 
 bus tokens,at present worth Â£15 a     
 year. Fares are cheap compared with   
 some other areas. The railway line was
 closed in 1953 and the nearest stat-  
 ions are Bishop Auckland and Durham.  </content>
