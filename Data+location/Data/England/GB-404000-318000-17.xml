		<title>17FARMING, RUGELEY</title>
		<content> The farm land to the northeast of     
 Rugeley occupies the flood plain of   
 the River Trent, the southwest-facing 
 valley side and the low ridge rising  
 50 metres above the Trent separating  
 it from the small valley of the River 
 Blythe. Fields adjacent to the river  
 are prone to waterlogging rather than 
 flooding and are used for grazing     
 cattle. Over the rest of the area, the
 soil is rich and given over to mixed  
 farming. This is mainly improved      
 grassland, cereals, oilseed rape and  
 root vegetables - usually potatoes.   
 The grazing is usually on the steeper 
 slopes or the flat land on the valley 
 floor. Most grazing is for cattle, the
 remainder being for sheep. There are  
 about 20 farms in the survey block    
 ranging in size from 40 to over 200   
 acres in size. There is one intensive 
 pig farm in the area.                 </content>
