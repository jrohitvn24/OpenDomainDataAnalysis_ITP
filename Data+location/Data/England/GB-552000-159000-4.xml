   On Friday three of us went to the   
Post Office and spoke to the Sub-      
Postmaster. The Post Office commenced  
in Otford in 1934 when it was where    
Nicola's is now. Then it moved to where
the Gunshop is, then to the Chemist's  
and finally to where it is now in      
Sevenoaks Road. There are approximately
350 customers a day served by five     
employees. Thursday is the busiest day 
and the beginning and end of the month 
are also very busy. The hours worked   
are usually 9.0 am to 1.0 pm and 2.0 pm
to 5.30 pm, except for Wednesday when  
they are open in the mornings only and 
similarly on Saturdays.                
   They get paid monthly (They are     
salaried) and the amount they get      
depends on how many points they score. 
The more points, the more money.
