		<title>20Mrs Wellington-Recollections</title>
		<content> Mrs. Wellington was 3 times mayor of  
 Romsey in the 1950's.{Traffic}During  
 her childhood there were only 4 cars  
 in Romsey. Most people had to walk    
 everywhere and as a result were fitter
 than they are today.{Industry}Most    
 people worked in Strongs-a brewery.   
 Other industries included a boatyard, 
 and a jam factory.{Drains}Not many    
 people had inside toilets so most had 
 an outside privy. Twice a week a night
 cart came to clear away all the mess. 
 In 1935 drains were built but they    
 were installed incorrectly and this   
 led to an epidemic of diptheria.{     
{Oddments}Mrs. Wellington said that she
 was never fond of television, but she 
 liked plays and ballet. She noted that
 when she was a child some dangerous   
 illnesses were easier to catch, most  
 noticeably diptheria, polio, measles  
 and whooping cough.                   </content>
