		<content>{GREAT BERWICK FARM}(CONT.FROM page 6) 
   The farmer said that it was         
 convenient living close to            
 Shrewsbury,yet away from the noise of 
 a town.                               
   The farm is also slightly historic, 
 as the farmer said it was possible    
 that troops had camped in the area of 
 the farm at the time of the Battle of 
 Shrewsbury.(1403).He also said that   
 the old Shrewsbury road used to cut   
 through the farm .
