The Barton Charity gives about two     
pounds to thirty old ppeople at        
Christmas, and at Easter the Dorothy   
Bathurst Charity gives money to old    
folk who did not receive any at        
Christmas. The Goudhurst Educational   
Foundation is a charity that provides  
money for school uniforms for three or 
four children each year. There ia a    
flat marble-topped tomb inside the     
church door to the Bathurst family     
late of Finchcocks, which is known     
locally as the Bread Tomb because      
loaves from a bequest are put there on 
the first and third Sundays for the    
poor to help themselves. The original  
order was for 40 loaves but inflation  
has reduced the sum to 4 small ones    
today.
