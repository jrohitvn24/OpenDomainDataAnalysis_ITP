		<title>01HARDWICK LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content>  This rural area is dominated by a    
 magnesian limestone escarpment,       
 running north to south, on which      
 stands{Hardwick Hall.}The high land to
 the east is high grade farmland, the  
 lower westerly land is irregular and  
 mainly grassland supporting cattle.   
  Underneath the whole area lie coal   
 measures, many of which have been     
 worked out. No working mines exist,   
 however, at the present time although 
 there are several adjacent to the     
 area.                                 
  The villages within the area are{Ault
{Hucknall, Stainsby, Hardstoft,        
{Astwith,}part of{Rowthorne}and part of
{Glapwell.                             
  The motorway,{M1,}traverses the area 
 south to north and is approximately   
 central on the lower land.            
  The local occupation is farming and  
 tourism, others being commuters.      </content>
