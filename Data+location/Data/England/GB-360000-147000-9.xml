		<title>09THE LIFE OF A CHILD 1986</title>
		<content> I am 10 year old Stephen Selway. On a 
 school day, I get up at 8.00 a.m. and 
 go to bed at 9.00 p.m. On a weekend I 
 get up at 9.00a.m. and go to bed at 10
 p.m. For breakfast I have Weetabix. On
 school days, for lunch I have         
 sandwiches, crisps, cake or biscuits; 
 but on weekends I have cooked lunches,
 baked beans, fried eggs, toast, chips 
 etc. Then I play football with my     
 friends or go on a bike ride around   
 the lanes. If it is raining I watch TV
 or play snooker. My pets are 100 fish 
 and a small rabbit. I think Binegar is
 nice, I would not like to move. My Mum
 goes shopping a lot. She goes to      
 Midsomer Norton or to the local shops,
 100 yd. away. My Dad is a builder and 
 my Mum is a housewife. I have a       
 brother who is 4 and a sister who is  
 7. We go to the village school, there 
 are56 pupils.I walk there up the lane.</content>
