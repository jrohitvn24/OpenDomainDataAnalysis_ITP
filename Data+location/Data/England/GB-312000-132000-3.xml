 school of 28 children and three       
 teachers.There is also a playgroup and
 a mother and toddler group.           
 There are three classrooms one for the
 infants, one for the juniors and one  
 for the playgroup. We have a library  
 opposite the junior class and the     
 little play group is next to the      
 juniors. Leading from the junior class
 is the kitchen. Next to the library is
 the heads office, a cupboard and sink 
 unit.                                 
 We have a school garden with a little 
 pond and shed. Over the garden wall is
 the swimming pool. The infants are    
 near the pool. We have a field where
