      In our village there are no food 
 shops.There is a garage and that sells
 sweets,crisps etc.We also have two    
 pubs one is called the{Victoria}and   
 the other is called the{Black Swan.   
 They both sell sweets as well as      
 alcohol.We have an Antique shop as    
 well and that is called{Wold Antiques.
 We have a wood shop and they make     
 furniture and things like that and it 
 is called{Oak Rabbit Crafts.We have   
 another shop and that shop sells      
 wrought iron and it is called{The Old 
{Granary.                              
                                       
      I think that we ought to have a  
 food shop because we have to go to    
 Driffield to buy our food.It is       
 especially difficult for old people to
 travel up to Driffield every week.
