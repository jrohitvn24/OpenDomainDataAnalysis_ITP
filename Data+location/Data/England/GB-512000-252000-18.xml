		<title>18Saturday at Home</title>
		<content> On Saturday mornings I get up at      
 6.00am and switch on my television.I  
 then have breakfast which is usually  
 Sugar Puffs,toast and tea.Then l watch
 more television and then get up and   
 get dressed.I sometimes go out and    
 play football while Mum does the      
 housework.Later I have to make my bed 
 and do my pocket money job,which is to
 take the dog for a walk.              
 After lunch,which is often salad,I    
 sometimes go out on my bike to visit a
 friend.BMX bikes are very popular at  
 the moment and people try to do stunts
 on their bikes with out falling off.I 
 sometimes have tea at my friend's     
 house.My Saturday ends as it starts,in
 front of the television.              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
