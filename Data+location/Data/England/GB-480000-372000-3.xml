		<content> Family Life in this rural area has    
 not changed as much as urban areas.   
 The family is still very much a unit  
 with children remaining in the home   
 until they marry or move to higher    
 education.  Unemployment has hit the  
 area. Some families the mother is able
 to find work easier than the father.  
 The average family has two or three   
 children.  Few boys work on the land. 
   Television is the main entertainment
 in the home with radio a close second.
 This is followed by record playing    
 equipment, young people being the     
 biggest buyers of popular music       
 records who often have record players 
 in their bedrooms where they entertain
 their friends. Mother is the main cook
 and the tendency is to eat less meat  
 but more natural foods.Coffee is more 
 popular than tea.The main meal is     
 eaten in the early evening.           </content>
