		<title>19RECREATION IN ASHBY MAGNA</title>
		<content> Recreational pursuits are mostly      
 enjoyed outside the area.  Spectator  
 sports such as rugby, football, motor 
 racing are sports that some villagers 
 regularly support.  Squash is played  
 in nearby clubs and Leisure Centres.  
                                       
 Keep fit classes are well attended and
 the Women's Institute arrange short   
 winter evening classes in flower      
 arranging, basket making and cane     
 work, and in the past handicrafts and 
 cake icing.                           
                                       
 Gardening is a past time most         
 inhabitants indulge in culminating in 
 a very competitive village Flower and 
 Vegetable Show in August.             
                                       
 Villagers often meet in the Chequers  
 Pub for a drink or a bar snack in a   
 traditional 'Country Inn' atmosphere. </content>
