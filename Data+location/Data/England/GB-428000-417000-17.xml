		<content> BLACKPOOL:Blackpool is a popular      
 resort on the Lancashire coast.Most   
 people go there for the amusement     
 arcades,shows and cicuses.I like the  
 amusement arcades because they have   
 all the latast space-invader video    
 games.                                
   People usually stay in hotels or    
 boarding houses.Some people prefer to 
 take their caravans or tents and stay 
 on one of the campsites. When I went  
 to Blackpool with my family we stayed 
 in a hotel.Ireally liked our hotel.In 
 the morning you had a choice of       
 cornflakes or orange juice to start   
 breakfast,followed by bacon and       
 eggs.They even gave you grilled bacon 
 if you wanted it.                     
 I enjoyed going to the Pleasure Beach 
 where there were lots of              
 exciting rides.We also hired fishing  
 tackle from a shop on the pier.       </content>
