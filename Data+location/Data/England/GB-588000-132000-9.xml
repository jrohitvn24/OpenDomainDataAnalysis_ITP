		<content> My dad works as a policeman. He works 
 at Tenterden police station. Sometimes
 he works nights and sleeps durig the  
 day. When dad is on night-shift my    
 sister and I have to be very quiet so 
 that we do not wake him. Sometimes our
 dad does area car work which means    
 that he drives a police car around the
 town to make sure that everything is  
 alright.Today is July 6th and my dad  
 is working from 4 o'clock in the      
 afternoon until 12 o'clock at night.My
 dad has been a policeman for 14 years.
 Tenterden Police Station is in Oaks   
 Road. It is a very small station with 
 only two cells which are very seldom  
 used. Any prisoners are taken to the  
 bigger station at Ashford 15 miles    
 away. Tenterden station closes at 10  
 p.m. It has a rest room for off-duty  
 officers and  is only open to the     
 public during the day.                </content>
