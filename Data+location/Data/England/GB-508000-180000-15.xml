		<title>15HOW WE AMUSE OURSELVES</title>
		<content>  On Saturdays we do not go to school, 
 but stay at home instead. Most of us  
 like to watch the television in the   
 morning and then go out to play. Some 
 of us play in the garden or wait for  
 mummy to take us to the park. Quite a 
 lot of us like to play out in the     
 street with our friends. Nearly all of
 us have got bikes, so we like to have 
 races round the block. Sometimes we   
 are allowed to go to the park by      
 ourselves to play. But most of all we 
 like to watch television in the       
 morning. If our mums let us we think  
 we might stay in front of the         
 television instead of coming to       
 school.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
