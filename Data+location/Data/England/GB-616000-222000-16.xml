		<title>16WORK ON THE FARM</title>
		<content> MY DAD WORKS ON A FARM. HIS DAY BEGINS
 AT 6 O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING WHEN HE   
 GOES TO MR. ROBERTS, THE FARM MANAGER,
 TO SEE WHAT WORK HE HAS TO DO THAT    
 DAY. HE MIGHT HAVE TO MEND THE        
 TRACTORS OR FARM MACHINERY, OR CLEAN  
 OUT THE COW PENS. HE ALSO GETS THE    
 FORK LIFT TRUCK TO CLEAR THE MUCK AND 
 TAKE IT AWAY ON THE TRAILER. HE DRIVES
 A TRACTOR TO PLOUGH THE FIELDS, AND IN
 SUMMER HE DRIVES THE COMBINE          
 HARVESTER. HE STOPS FOR LUNCH BETWEEN 
 12 NOON AND 1p.m. AND HIS WORK DAY    
 USUALLY FINISHES AT 4.30p.m. HE HAS   
 MOST WEEKENDS OFF BUT ALL THE FARM    
 WORKERS TAKE TURNS TO FEED THE COWS ON
 SATURDAYS AND SUNDAYS. WE LIVE IN A   
 COTTAGE ON THE FARM SO MY DAD DOESN'T 
 HAVE FAR TO GO TO WORK BUT IF HE      
 LEAVES HIS JOB WE HAVE TO LEAVE OUR   
 HOME BECAUSE THE HOUSE GOES WITH THE  
 JOB.                                  </content>
