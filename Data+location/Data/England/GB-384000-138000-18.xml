		<title>18B and B:The Deverills</title>
		<content> Just before the cross roads at        
{Longbridge Deverill}is a lovely old   
 stone farmhouse built at the time of  
{Queen Anne.}It has a Georgian         
 extension but about 15 years ago it   
 was in such a state of disrepair that 
 the Longleat Estate sold it and built 
 a new farmhouse. It is now beautifully
 renovated and still has its old       
 flag-stone floors, low-beamed ceilings
 and huge wooden doors. Now it has a   
 Bed and Breakfast sign outside.       
 Visitors to the village include       
 Americans, French, Germans and        
 Italians. Other visitors include Civil
 Servants, Inspectors for the Fish Farm
 and surrounding farms. The new owner  
 speaks six languages and finds this   
 very useful for his overseas guests.  
 He has lived in many parts of the     
 world and settled here because it is  
 such a beautiful area.                </content>
