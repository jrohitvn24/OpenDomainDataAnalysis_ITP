		<title>12The Ecology of Himbleton</title>
		<content>      Over the past 10 years emphasis  
 has been placed on cereal growing with
 farmers removing hedges and trees to  
 accommodate larger farm machinery ,   
 also much of the land has been drained
 thus causing a loss of wildlife.      
      In 1985 with a surplus of grain ,
 steps are being taken to make everyone
 conservation minded. The enforcment of
 the new Wildlife &amp; Countryside Act    
 should help. Notable conservation work
 in the area is the clearence and      
 replanting of Hornhill Wood,Earls     
 Common which along with other sites   
 has been designated as an area of     
 "Special Scientific Interest"(S.S.I.).
      A great deal of work has been    
 done on Bow Brook to reduce pollution.
 The Mill Pond at Shell Mill has been  
 renovated and the trout and course    
 fish that have been introduced are now
 breeding naturally.                   </content>
