 I live in the village of Camblesforth 
 which is five miles away from Selby in
 the County of North Yorkshire. I have 
 lived in Camblesforth all my life. The
 village is growing. There is a Post   
 Office which also sells groceries.    
 There is a mini-market, a small       
 supermarket, a hairdresser, and a fish
 and chip shop which has customers from
 local villages as well as residents.  
 The village hall has a new extension  
 and has just been repainted and is    
 very well used. The Primary School    
 moved into new buildings in 1972. The 
 village is dominated by Drax Power    
 Station. This was started in 1967 with
 a second phase begun in 1977. When    
 complete it will be the largest       
 coal-fired power station in Western   
 Europe.
