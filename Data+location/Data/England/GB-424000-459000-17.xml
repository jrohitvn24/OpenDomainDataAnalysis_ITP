		<title>17THE WEEKEND</title>
		<content> On Monday Peter and I went stoning    
 with Mark, Richard and Edwin in Bridge
 End field ready for planting turnips. 
 In the field there were lots of metal 
 pieces of old cars and lots of stones.
 when we had finished there was a      
 trailer full of stones. Richard went  
 and tipped the stones on the railway  
 line while Edwin, Peter and I, went   
 back to the farm to help  with the    
 cattle. After dinner we went down to  
 the farm to pick up Mark to go        
 sticking and stoning in a fifty-five  
 acre field. When we were going round  
 the field Richard was heavy rolling in
 the next field. Also in that field,   
 there were lots of stones. We put some
 stones in the trailer, and where the  
 wall had fallen down we repaired it.  
 Mark found some old leather boots so  
 he put them in the wall also.
