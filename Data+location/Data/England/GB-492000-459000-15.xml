		<title>15Wetwang,Employment.</title>
		<content>      Although alot of people are      
 employed in agriculture in one way or 
 another,some people live in Wetwang   
 and go to other places to work.From   
 Wetwang it is not too difficult to get
 to Driffield,York,Beverley and Hull if
 you have got your own transport or if 
 you can share with a friend.          
      We asked the children in our     
 class what jobs their parents did if  
 they did not work on farms.They said  
 they did these jobs:delivery          
 driver,lorry driver,continental lorry 
 driver,army driver,singer,television  
 engineer,auctioneer,home help,cleaner 
 in the pub,market trader,student,     
 waitress.Some mums are on the dole or 
 are a housewife or having a baby.     
      Most people are employed and only
 the teenagers are unemployed and go on
 YTS jobs or have to go to college.
