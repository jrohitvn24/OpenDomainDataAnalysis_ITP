		<content> The majority of people have telephones
 and regular postal deliveries. Only   
 residents in the village have the     
 opportunity of having newspapers      
 delivered, although many do not take a
 daily paper because of cost. Two      
 weekly local papers are available,    
 along with one free monthly "glossie" 
 both parish and local organisation    
 news can be found in the monthly      
 Parish Magazine.                      
 A small percentage of households own a
 computer, mainly for entertainment but
 some for work or education. Farmers   
 are beginning to use computers in     
 their work.                           
 The travelling library visits the     
 village once a fortnight and is       
 regarded as essential by non car      
 users.
