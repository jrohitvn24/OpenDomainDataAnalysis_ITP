		<content> All Saints Church was opened in 1903  
 and built in the English Mediaeval    
 Style to emphasise unity felt with the
 Roman Catholic faith. It has this year
 been made a Parish Church, Elland     
 being split into two parishes.        
 During this century the attendances at
 all churches have dwindled and within 
 the last ten years several churches   
 have combined in worship at Southgate 
 Methodist Church.  These are Wesley   
 Methodist, Temperence Street Methodist
 St.Paul's Methodist and a church from 
 West Vale.
