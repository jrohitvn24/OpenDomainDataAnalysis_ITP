		<title>01DESCRIPTION OF BERE REGIS</title>
		<content> It is a medium-sized village lying at 
 the junction of the roads to Poole and
 to Bovington. A bypass goes round it  
 from Poole to Dorchester and buses    
 pass through.A brook called Bere      
 Stream runs through the village and a 
 lot of watercress is grown by it.The  
 cress from the beds is cut and sent   
 away to market.The village is in a dip
 between Black Hill and Woodbury       
 Hill.These hills are covered by woods 
 and heath.There are five shops,a      
 garage,two pubs,an ancient church and 
 a first school. Some houses are old   
 and thatched but there are new houses 
 on an estate.There is no gas in the   
 village so people use electricity,    
 oil, wood and coal. There are quite a 
 lot of clubs. All round the village   
 are farms.
