  We studied the area around {Brook}and
{Hulverstone}.These are in the         
 South-West of the Island and are next 
 to the sea.                           
  These are areas of intensive         
 crop-growing,rough-grazing and        
 silage;but is used mainly for         
{arable}farming rather than dairy or   
 sheep farming.                        
  The land is hilly and attracts many  
 tourists who admire the marvellous    
 views to be seen.                     
  The coastline they see is one of     
 rugged cliffs combined with sandy     
 beaches,and the two villages{small}and
{picturesque.}There are no local shops 
 but public transport is available to  
 the inhabitants who wish to travel to 
 outside towns.
