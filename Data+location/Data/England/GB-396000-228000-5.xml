		<title>05Gotherington School 2</title>
		<content> The school is organized into 4 classes
 one of which is taught by two         
 teachers.There is a Head, Deputy Head,
 and a Scale 2 post for Art &amp; Craft.   
 There is also a Scale 1 post and one  
 teacher who teaches .5 of the time.   
 Falling numbers and amalgamation onto 
 one site have meant a reduction in    
 staffing which, at one time, stood at 
 7 full-time members. The curriculum is
 broadly based and aims to give the    
 children experience of a wide range of
 activities. A recent influx of new    
 equipment means that we are now one of
 the best equipped schools in the      
 county and have been able to expand   
 the curriculum slightly.Activities are
 carried on after school and include   
 gymnastics, netball, badminton, drama,
 athletics, cricket, cycling &amp;         
 orienteering.Extra music activities   
 are given in the lunch hour.          </content>
