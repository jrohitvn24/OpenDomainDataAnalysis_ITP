		<content> In 1983, Roger Flynn bought the old   
 control tower on Hadstock aerodrome,  
 or Little Walden airfield, as it was  
 officially known.  The building had   
 once housed communication equipment in
 the days when the airfield was the    
 base for USAF Havocs and Mustangs.    
    The two-storey, flat-roofed build- 
 ing has been restored, and provides   
 comfortable working space for five or 
 six people.  The views from the       
 windows are beautiful, and there are  
 not the car-parking problems that an  
 office in town would have.  Peter     
 Flynn thinks it is an ideal place to  
 work.  Maybe the only problem is that 
 when thunderstorms roll over the area,
 the phone and electricity may fail.   
    The building is quite often visited
 by veteran airmen, who have provided  
 photographs of its operational days,  
 and commemorative plaques.            </content>
