		<title>20THE AREA IN GENERAL</title>
		<content> This is a quiet area,although it has  
 one of the most busy roads going      
 through it:the A27.Stanmer Park is    
 very big and used for several         
 recreational games,or sports,e.g:     
 football,cricket,tennis,etc.Wild Park 
 is also very large,and is used very   
 much the same as Wild Park,but Wild   
 Park does not have a church,a village 
 or a farm,as Stanmer does.Although it 
 is a quiet area at the moment,it may  
 not be for much longer,as the proposed
 Brighton By pass may be built,running 
 through the middle of the south downs.
 Coldean is the only housing estate in 
 the area,an is not very large although
 there is two schools there.
