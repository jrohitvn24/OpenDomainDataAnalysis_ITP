 The Chelmer and Blackwater canal is a 
 stretch of the River Chelmer which was
 made navigable in 1797.The canal runs 
 for 22km from the Heybridge Basin to  
 the Springfield Basin; from Maldon to 
 Chelmsford.                           
   The canal includes 12 locks, 11 on  
 the river and 1 sea lock. It has a    
 total fall of 76 feet and 11 inches.  
   Originally the canal was used for   
 the transportation of coal and bulky  
 raw materials. Between 1797 and 1845  
 this was a profitable venture and     
 continued to be so between 1846 and   
 1865. From 1866 to 1914 the Company   
 declined as a Navigation as railways  
 could viably compete with the canal   
 and this decline continued further    
 from 1915 and 1973 when it ceased to  
 operate as a system of transport and  
 trade.                                </content>
