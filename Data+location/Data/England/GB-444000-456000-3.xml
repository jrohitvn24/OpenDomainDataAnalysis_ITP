		<content> The road through our village is very  
 busy it is called A 59 it goes from   
 York to Harrogate.Heavy vehicles go to
 the Al from the A59. It is so busy we 
 need a crossing lady. She is called   
 Mrs. Phillips.In l986 we are getting  
 a bypass.                             
 Every day for a week we went out at   
 9.00am to 9.15am,11.00am to 11.15am   
 and 3.00pm to 3.15pm.At the 9.00      
 count 3 quarters of the count was cars
 and nearly 1 quarter was HGVs and     
 lorries.The 11.00 count again was     
 mostly cars with quite a few HGVs and 
 lorries and a few vans.The 3.00pm     
 count had a lot of cars and nearly 1  
 quarter of HGVs and lorries.We only   
 saw one bicycle in one of the         
 days.There were not many buses and    
 hardly any motorbikes.
