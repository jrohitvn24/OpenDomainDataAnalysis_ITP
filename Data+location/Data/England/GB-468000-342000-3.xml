 Miss Hand is one of the village's     
 oldest inhabitants.She was born in    
 Shelton (a nearby village) in{1900.}  
 She lived there for{six}years then    
 she moved to East Bridgford.She       
 started school when she was{4}years   
 old in Shelton then she came to       
 East Bridgford where she left school  
 when she was{12.}She used to help her 
 mum in her spare time. They didn't    
 have any water so they had to get it  
 from a well. They had no lighting or  
 heating so they had to use an oil     
 lamp for lighting. They didn't have   
 a television or radio. One of her jobs
 was working for  Arthur Du Boulay Hill
 who wrote a book about East Bridgford.
