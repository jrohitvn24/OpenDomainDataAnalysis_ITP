		<title>03MY DAD by Lindsay Smith.</title>
		<content>  I am Lindsay Smith and my dad works  
 in the Stoneywood paper-mill 5 miles N
 of Aberdeen.He works night shift or   
 during the day.At night his hours are 
 18:00_06:00 or 06:00_14:00.If he works
 during the day his hours are 14:00-   
 20:00.His days off are on a roster.   
  On his days off he goes to the       
 Stoneywood social club and plays a    
 game of squash.When he is finished    
 his game he goes to the bar to have a 
 drink.I sometimes have to wash his    
 smelly socks!In the social club there 
 is also a dining-room where he can    
 have a bar-supper.You have to be an   
 employee of the Stoneywood Mill to be 
 admitted.You need a special membership
 card to get in (or you can borrow a   
 friend's card)!The card has got a     
 special number on it. With this card  
 you can let yourself and two other    
 people in by the automatic door.      </content>
