		<title>11LIFE ON SUNDAY</title>
		<content> Most Sundays I get up at about {7.30am
 because my sister Gemma always wakes  
 me up.When we come down stairs for    
 breakfast mum sometimes tells us where
 we will be going during the day.Most  
 Sundays my Mum takes us to see our nan
 who lives at {NOWETH PLACE},we get    
 there at about {10'o'clock}.As soon as
 we get there my nan gives us a drink  
   and something to eat.When we finish 
 our drink and food my nan takes me    
 into the front room and I try to      
 finish my tapestry book mark while my 
 sister plays with her dolls.When we go
 home mum sometimes lets us go to the  
 beach.We get our swimming costumes    
 ready,food and other things that we   
 need then we set of.When we get there 
 first thing I do is run in to the     
 water and have splash about with my   
 brother.                              
                                       </content>
