		<content> For active people{Denaby Main}isn't   
 the place to live.Recently the council
 built a{B.M.X. course}which is not    
 much good for children whose skills   
 need improving. There is a hobby for  
 people of a peaceful nature they study
{ornithology}at Denaby Ings,a natural  
 beauty spot with a good selection of  
 birds.Cricket and swimming are popular
 .There is a {football club}and bowling
 greens,one better equipped than the   
 other.Mostly people of sixty or more  
 enjoy this pasttime.For the younger   
 generation there is a youth club,they 
 hold discos,a snooker challenge.At{Tom
{Hill}there is {boxing}three nights    
 weekly.Many{working mens clubs}and    
 pubs are usually busy all hours.A     
 converted cinema is a bingo hall and  
 whist is played in the clubs.An       
 enjoyable hobby is pigeon flying,     
 another is cultivating allotments.    </content>
