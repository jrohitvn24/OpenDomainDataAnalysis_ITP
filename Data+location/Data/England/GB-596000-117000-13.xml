		<content> The village of Camber is polliced by a
 constable who knows most of the       
 residents.  During the summer months  
 the population swells from about 1000 
 to upwards of 20,000 people, and on a 
 hot summer's day, especially if it is 
 a weekend.  Two constables who live in
 the village, whose duties are usually 
 in Rye, patrol the village in the     
 summer months.  Most of the offences  
 that have to be dealt with are minor  
 thefts and damage to cars. The police 
 also cope with scores of lost and     
 found children, and keep an eye on    
 beach barbeques when enthusiastic     
 youngsters, full of joie-de-vivre,    
 with radios at full blast, and people 
 sleeping nearby.  The police endeavour
 to keep a balance, letting the young  
 have fun without disturbing the local 
 populace.                             
                                       </content>
