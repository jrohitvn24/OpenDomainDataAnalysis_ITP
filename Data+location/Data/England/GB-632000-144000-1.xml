		<title>01THE AREA</title>
		<content> The 12km area is of chalk downland of 
 the cretaceous period under lain by   
 clays. The soil is derived from the   
 weathered residue of the chalk,a clay_
 with_flints mixture. This gives rise  
 to a calcemorphic brown earth. The    
 area has a general trend to the south 
 west and the cliffs. Surface drainage 
 is at present for the most part absent
 but there is evidence in the landscpe 
 of a past drainage pattern,now seen   
 only as a series of small dry_valleys.
 Many of the small farmsteads have     
 occupied these re_entrant areas. One  
 would suggest this would be due to the
 collection of water in the areas in a 
 time of increased rainfall. The       
 settlements,many of the very old,are  
 of a nodal patten with little ribbon  
 development except in the large       
 villages Employment is mainly         
 associated with the docks in Dover.   </content>
