		<content> Claire,Catherine and myself went for a
 walk round Ashover.We looked at some  
 of the house to try to find out       
 about the peoples life styes.Also by  
 looking at the way people dressed     
 and the cars they drove,we think that 
 their are some quite rich people      
 and that the children are well cared  
 for.The people that lived in the      
 Hollies (thats next to the school)    
 must have been quite well  off because
 they have got a private drive.        
 Amberstone House looks very nice the  
 people who own it must live in luxury 
 because they got a swimming pool.     
 Redworth,thats a house on the         
 Rattle,looks lovely and is worth a lot
 of money.The life of most people in   
 our area is good because we think     
 that they earn more than the average  
 person.
