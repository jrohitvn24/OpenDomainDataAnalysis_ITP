 LOCAL HISTORY                         
 Most people enjoy the peace and quiet 
 and also the country side of          
 Bentworth.People think there should   
 be a village shop.Also some people    
 find it cold.The speed of the traffic 
 is a common complaint.Friendly people 
 live in Bentworth.There is a limited  
 amount of public transport.           
 We found out that about 10 years ago  
 people started to come to live in     
 Bentworth.In the last 5 years 21 new  
 families have come to Bentworth.About 
 10 to 20 years ago very few families  
 came to Bentworth.Over 20 years ago   
 many more families came to live in    
 Bentworth than ever before.
