		<content> As our area is only 2 miles from the  
 sea we get lots of{visitors.}Mostly   
 these come for the day,or to stay with
 relatives.In our section we have 3    
 Caravan Sites, 2 Hotels, a Motel,and  
 some Bed and Breakfast places.        
 Beauport and Crowhurst{Caravan Parks  
 are in the middle of woodland, and are
 attractively set out. They have good  
 shops which our Mums use sometimes.   
 They give work for local people       
 running and cleaning the sites.       
{Beauport Park Hotel}is quite large,   
 with lovely grounds; it is only 3     
 miles from the sea.{High Beech Motel  
 is nearby and just off the A.21 road  
 from London.{Bed and Breakfast}(from  
 Â£7.00 a night) is very popular.       
 From Easter to September many{foreign 
{students}come to Hastings to learn    
 English.Lots of families in Hollington
 have students staying.It's interesting</content>
