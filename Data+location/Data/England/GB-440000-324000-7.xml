		<title>07Farming near Donington Park</title>
		<content> There are two farms with land         
 adjoining Donington Park Racing       
 Circuit, Hill Top and Donington Park  
 farms. On both about half the land is 
 used for grazing beef cattle and half 
 for arable crops. There are several   
 small deciduous copses on these farms.
 Both farms are within the 3 mile limit
 of the East Midlands Airport and,     
 therefore, planning permission is     
 required for any changes in the nature
 of the farming.                       
 On Hill Top Farm are the remains of a 
 brickyard which supplied bricks for   
 the building of many of the older     
 houses in Castle Donington.           
 Donington Park Farm now offers Bed and
 Breakfast facilities to visitors to   
 the area.
