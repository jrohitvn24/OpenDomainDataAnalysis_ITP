		<title>01REVIEW OF BLOCK ID:1900128.</title>
		<content> The majority of this area is          
 designated as an {Inner City Area,}   
 with all its attendant problems       
 i.e.Industry and Employment, Social   
 and Community Facilities, Housing, and
 Industrial and Commercial Environment.
 The remainder of the block comprises a
 mixture of private housing, new and   
 old commercial development, shopping  
 areas, derelict industrial sites and  
 recreational facilities. The area is  
 bisected North/South by the{River Hull
 which, although it is still in use as 
 a commercial waterway, has declined in
 importance because of dock development
 on the banks of the Humber. Much of   
 the old back to back housing has been,
 or is being, demolished and new       
 estates built.These estates tend to be
 adjacent to main thoroughfares and yet
 with their own self contained system  
 of roadways, mostly cul-de-sacs.      </content>
