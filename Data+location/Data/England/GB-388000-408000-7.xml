      My name is Linda-jane and I am   
 ten years old. On saturdays I go      
 Morris Dancing. We start at 9 o'clock 
 in the morning and the competitions   
 can go on until 7 o'clock in the      
 evening.                              
                                       
      I used to be a leader for a      
 troupe called Queensway Royals. This  
 means I used to hit a tambourine which
 would tell the other dancers when to  
 turn. They all carried shakers which  
 make a spectacular display when they  
 all make their arm movements together.
                                       
      Today I brought my medals into   
 school to show everyone. About four   
 weeks ago my mum was training to be a 
 judge. Last week she passed her test.
