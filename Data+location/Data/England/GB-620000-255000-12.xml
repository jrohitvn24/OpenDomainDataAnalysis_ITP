  In our village there are lots of     
clubs and organisations.These include  
modern dancing,ballet ,brownies,cubs,  
football,scouts,PTA,under              
fives,toddlers,youth club,over         
60s,bowls,drama group and gym.I go to  
cubs and we meet in the scout hut at   
six o'clock until half past seven.We   
play lots of games like football and we
also work towards badges. At the moment
our leader is Roger Arbon.There are    
about 12 people in our patrol.I am the 
sixer of the red six.Sometimes we go   
tracking and later on in the year there
is going to be a camp.We are also going
to go on a river cruise up the river   
Deben that is the river in Woodbridge.
