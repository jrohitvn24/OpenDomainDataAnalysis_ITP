		<title>05WOODHAM WALTER HALL</title>
		<content> Cutting a path we slid into the       
 drained moat in the ruins of Woodham  
 Walter Hall.Once this had been an     
 impressive manor belonging to the     
 Fitzwalter family.The surrounding     
 lands have evidence of the park,      
 warren,wilderness and fish ponds which
 provided sport and a full pantry.     
 Earlier visitors before us included   
{Anne Boleyn,Elizabeth I and Mary Tudor
 Whilst at the Hall Mary had planned to
 flee from England.If she had succeeded
 our history might have been quite     
 different The Hall was dismantled in  
 1700.Around 1830 the site housed the  
 falconer's lodge and hawks'mews of    
 the Lord Falconer of England.The Halls
 chapel was dilapidated so in 1562 a   
 new Elizabethan Church was built      
 closer to the village,one of only six 
 in England. .
