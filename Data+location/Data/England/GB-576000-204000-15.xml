		<title>15ST. CLERES HALL</title>
		<content> St. Cleres Hall is said to be an area 
 of some 1550 acres.The actual hall    
 that now stands was owned by the      
 St.Clere family from the time of 1291 
 but again there is no actual evidence 
 that the present building was standing
 then.The back of the house is         
 definitely older than the front.It has
 been told that the back part dates to 
 the 13th century,and that the front   
 elevation is quite new-18th-19th      
 century.St.Cleres Hall has a very     
 beautiful barn dated at 1582.There is 
 another barn,just as old,but in a very
 bad state of repair.The basic walls   
 are approximately 36 cms thick made   
 from stone with brick facing.The      
 ceilings in most rooms are lathe and  
 plaster.The actual house that now     
 stands on the site was definitely not 
 there at the time of William the      
 Conquerer.                            </content>
