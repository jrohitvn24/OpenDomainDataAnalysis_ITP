 building firm which has large premises
 in the village and provides jobs for  
 the erstwhile farm workers. The       
 appearance of the village has         
 changed.There is no longer so much    
 movement of livestock through the     
 village from farms to outlying fields,
 and there are more cars and tractors  
 about. The Processed Pea,a folk club, 
 run by the landlord of the village pub
 attracts visitors and entertainers    
 from around Humberside and Yorkshire. 
 The village also has a stud breeding  
 thoroughbreds and Mountain Moorlands &amp;
 the'Kennels',a large house thought to 
 contain the remains of an old         
 monastery,where the Holderness Hunt   
 pack is kept.There is also a village  
 pond with a variety of wild ducks     
 feeding there.
