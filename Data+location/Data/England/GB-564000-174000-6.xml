		<title>06A SCHOOL DAY IN TILBURY</title>
		<content> My name is Keirsty. I have lived in   
 Tilbury all my life. I was born in    
 1975 so I am ten this year. I go to { 
{Manor Junior}School. I am in the third
 year and my teacher's name is Mrs     
 Grant. We go in class at 8.55 am. We  
 start work until 10.15 am then we go  
 out to play. Assembly lasts from 10.30
 to 11.00 am. After assembly we go back
 to class for more work. At 12.00 it is
 lunch-time. You can have school       
 dinners, sandwiches or go home. We go 
 into class again at 1.15 pm and we do 
 more work. At 3.00 pm we stop work and
 tidy up. If we have any spare time we 
 do plays and comedy sketches. The bell
 goes at 3.05 pm and we all go home.   
 There are 29 of us in class 11, some  
 are third years like me and some are  
 fourth years.
