 Shavington spent 32 years in Local    
 Government at Parish and Borough      
 level. He became Mayor of Crewe &amp;

 he attended a garden party at         
 Buckingham Palace, visited Belgium    
 with Crewe "It's a Knockout" team and 
 also Crewe's twin town, Macon, France.
{Mr. Sam Henshall}, Shavington Lodge,  
 Weston Lane, was a slaughterer,       
 wholesale and retail butcher for      
 nearly 50 years (first with father and
 later on his own). The shop on        
 Nantwich Road, Crewe (now sold) still 
 bears his name. He retired to breed   
 pedigree cattle. From two, he produced
 a prize-winning herd of 30 beasts,    
 known as "The Lodge Herd" of British  
 Simmenthals. One cow alone has        
 produced 4 bulls selling for a total  
 of Â£13,500.                           </content>
