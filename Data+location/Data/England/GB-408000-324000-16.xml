		<title>16A DAY IN MY LIFE pt2</title>
		<content> At twelve o'clock it is dinnertime,we 
 go out to play until it is time for us
 to go in for dinner.                  
 In the afternoon we do our work about 
 the Near and Far television programme.
 At half past three it is home time    
 and the taxi comes to take me home.I  
 get home at about four o'clock and go 
 up stairs and get ready in my old     
 clothes and then Mum,Dad and I go and 
 get the cows into the shed.My brother 
 Steven helps us take the milking units
 into the shed then we start           
 milking.Then when milking is finished 
 we clean all the sheds out and then go
 into the house for tea.After that I   
 usually watch the television until    
 eight o'clock when I go to bed        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
