{Smoking:}In our sample only 17% of the
 people admitted to smoking cigarettes 
 and none of these smoked more than 20 
 each day.  This indicates that people 
 are heeding the health warnings       
 surrounding smoking, and as a result  
 the number of smokers in our area     
 seems relatively low.                 
{Alcohol:}30 of the sample admitted to 
 drinking alcohol even though they were
 aware of it's health risks.  However  
 the proportion of people who drank    
 daily was only 7%.  Most people seemed
 to realise that heavy drinking is     
 dangerous and as a result the other   
 93% only drank 2-3 times a week at the
 most (many of these only drank on     
 special occasions such as Christmas   
 and weddings).
