 this year it was held at Lingham      
 School.Its starts at Upton and a big  
 procession works its way down to where
 it is held.The Carnival Princess was  
 also at the carnival.There was also a 
 stand which would paint your face and 
 dye your hair in different colours,and
 everyone enjoyed the inflatable.As    
 always the carnival soon ended,but    
 everyone had thoroughly enjoyed it.24 
 schools were there and six games were 
 being played at once.The games started
 and our first game was against        
 Ballantyne. Before hand Debbie was    
 going round saying "watch out         
 Ballantyne are very good you know".   
 Then who has to go and score a        
 rounder? Debbie! we beat Ballantyne   
 1_0,we were off to a good start.We    
 played all our games drew one and won 
 the rest.....                         </content>
