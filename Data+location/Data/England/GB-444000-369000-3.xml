 Bolsover Castle is a major tourist    
 attraction. It stands on the crest of 
 an escarpment which runs from north to
 south through the eastern part of the 
 survey area. The site dates back to   
{Norman times}when{William the         
{Conqueror}gave the site to{William    
{Peveril.}A keep was built at that time
 and the present keep or 'Little       
 Castle' stands on that site. The      
 present keep was built by{Sir Charles 
{Cavendish}in 1613.{William,}his son,  
 added the Riding School (now restored)
 and the Terrace (now ruined). The keep
 contains about 30 apartments. At the  
 present time the old Smithy, next to  
 the Riding School, is being restored. 
 When restoration work is complete it  
 will probably house a museum and      
 tea-room.                             </content>
