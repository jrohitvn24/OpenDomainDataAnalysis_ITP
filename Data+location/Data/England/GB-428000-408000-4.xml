		<content>   In ecological terms our area is one 
 of contrast.On the one hand we have   
 policies designed to retain the look  
 of the area,on the other we have a    
 certain amount of{pollution}from a    
 number of large factories.            
   Present{conservation}campaigns focus
 on landscaping spoil heaps,reducing   
 the amount of litter and the dumping  
 of waste into rivers. Most of the     
 residential areas were made smokeless 
 zones in the 1970's.However, factories
 still omit fumes into the air.        
   Around Cawthorne and Haigh Wood     
 there are many footpaths.These woods  
 are teeming with{wildlife}such as red 
 deer,badgers,grey squirrels and       
 uncommon birds. Many areas are covered
 by woodland.                          
   The area lies in the foothills of   
 the Pennines and we have a lot of rain
 and cool cloudy weather.              </content>
