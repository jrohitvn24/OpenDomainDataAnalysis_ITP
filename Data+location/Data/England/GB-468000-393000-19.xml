		<title>19A BANK HOLIDAY WEEKEND</title>
		<content> Yesterday I went to my Granma's and   
 grandad's.On Sunday I played at doing 
 "Sign Post To English",Then I helped  
 my mum and dad with the gardening.Then
 I went to Sunday School where we did  
 a collarge of things that were going  
 to be alive.I also went to Bircots for
 a swimming lesson.I'm getting better  
 at breast-stroke but my best stroke is
 front crawl.On Bank Hoilday Monday I  
 watched the Wide Awake Club which had 
 a film on all about war.Then I watched
 a video about Superted and Spotty at  
 the Funfair.It was brilliant.
