		<title>04People of Mowsley &amp; Laughton</title>
		<content>  The{population}of the area is about  
 310;209 in Mowsley, 79 in Laughton,and
 the rest in outlying farms.The average
 number of children per family is below
 2,and many villagers are over 50 years
 old.Some older people live alone,a few
 in large,old houses.                  
  In both villages there are families  
 who have occupied homes for 2 or more 
 generations,and "incomers"-especially 
 in the newer houses in Mowsley,and the
 renovated farms and cottages in       
 Laughton.Most of the{newcomers}take an
 active part in{village life,}and      
 support the various events.When asked 
 people say the main advanteges of     
 living here are the peace,slower pace 
 of life,the{friendly community,}and   
 the beauty of the countryside.The dis-
 advantages are mainly the lack of any 
 public transport,and absence of shops,
 post office and gas.                  </content>
