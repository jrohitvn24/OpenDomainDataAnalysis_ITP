		<title>10A DAY IN THE LIFE OF MY DAD</title>
		<content>{My dad gets up at 6:30a.m.,he has     
{breakfast,then leaves for work at     
{7a.m. and starts at 7:30a.m.He checks 
{his lorry and takes it to the         
{workhouse for loading.After loading up
{he collects the paperwork and sets off
{to deliver his load.The load is a     
{multidrop which means that there is   
{more than one delivery,it can be 40   
{deliveries,all to different           
{destinations.As well as driving,my dad
{has to check all the paperwork and    
{ensure the customer receives his/her  
{correct order.In the dashboard there  
{is a}Tachograph{which measures how    
{long and how far the driver has       
{driven.At about 12:30 he stops at a   
{transport cafe for lunch and diesel.  
{After completing his deliveries he    
{returns to the depot,hands in his     
{paperwork and goes home.
