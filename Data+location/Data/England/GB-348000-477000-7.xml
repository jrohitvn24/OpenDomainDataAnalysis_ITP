		<content> There are two in this area.Beetham    
 Nurseries  opened four months ago,but 
 preparations started six mounths      
 before.It sells several hundred       
 varieties of plants to the public but 
 no cut flowers.                       
 It opens eight thirty a.m and closes  
 between six and seven p.m.The busiest 
 times of the year are Sundays in      
 Spring.They have five staff,three part
 time and two full time.They have about
 three acres of land,which was bought  
 from a local land owner.They are      
 optimistic about the future and are   
 planning to extend.They are already   
 planning greenhouses for growing their
 own plants.
