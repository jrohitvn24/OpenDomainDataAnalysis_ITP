		<content> For many years the{Sewage Farm}was    
 inadequate, and there was no new      
 building. It has now been brought up  
 to date, and some new building is     
 going ahead.                          
{                                      
{High Mill, Goffa Mill,}the{Old School}
 and some old{barns}have been{converted
 to very attractive dwellings.         
 A builder who bought up most of the   
 spare land within the village has not 
 made use of it yet.                   
                                       
 There is no{slum property}in the      
 village. All the old cottages have    
 been brought up to date, and property 
 here tends to be more{expensive}than  
 in nearby Skipton.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
