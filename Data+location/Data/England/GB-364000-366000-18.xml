		<title>18   The River Weaver</title>
		<content>    Sun dances on the water like       
 fairies,                              
    With their shining wands.          
    Twisting and turning as a snake,   
    Ripples small waves in it's body.  
    Silence cracked by traffic.        
    And the waters quiver,erupting     
    volcano like.                      
    Washing weeping willows by the     
 water,                                
    And lamposts are creatures,        
    From war of the worlds,            
    The light a shining eye,           
    Looking at me from the water.      
                                       
    This is a poem about the River     
 Weaver which runs through Winsford    
 and has its scource in Shropshire. The
 River Weaver joins the River Mersey.  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
