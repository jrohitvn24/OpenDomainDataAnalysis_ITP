		<title>20LOWER TEST VALLEY,CONCLUSION</title>
		<content>  The area is affected by its position 
 on the outskirts of Southampton and   
 Winchester,for although it remains a  
 farming area it is not isolated.      
  We found it an interesting area to   
 study.The countryside was pleasant,but
 we felt the electricity pylons which  
 cross the Test valley spoil its       
 appearance.Apart from this it has not 
 changed very much since the first     
 Domesday survey, and we wonder whether
 it will change in the next 900 years. 
  The work was completed in Geography  
 classes by 12_13_year_old girls from  
 3A,3B and 3C of the Atherley School,  
 Southampton.
