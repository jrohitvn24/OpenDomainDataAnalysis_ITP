 site of the church built before the   
{Conquest.}The first vicar was William 
 De Godesdon.The date of presentation  
 was 22nd February 1232.               
     Across the road is an old house   
 where{Mrs Warboys}(a typical old      
 villager)lives.She has lived in the   
 village for 40 years but she has lived
 in that particular house for 9 years  
 as her other one burnt down.          
     Her house is{Dutch.}When the Dutch
 people came to{drain the fens}they    
 would live in it.                     
     Above the house is a sign which   
 says{'1715 NIET ZONDER HRBYT'}(which  
 means{'Nothing gained without labour')
     There is a{pub}on one corner of   
 the village called{'The Three Tuns'   
 which was built in 1799.  There are   
 more old houses than new ones,and most
 of the new ones are detatched.        </content>
