		<content>{The Summerfields Estate.}Building     
 began in 1974. They were then building
 six different types of houses. These  
 were two-bedroomed, three-bedroomed   
 and four-bedroomed{semi-detached      
 houses.  Over the years land prices   
 rose so smaller houses were built. Now
 one-bedroomed and two-bedroomed       
{terraced}houses are built, plus two   
 and three bedroomed semi-detached     
 houses, two-bedroomed semi-detached   
{bungalows}and three and four bedroomed
{detached}houses. Construction has     
 changed over the years and two types  
 of houses are now being built:-       
{timber framed and traditional brick.  
 Both types are found on the estate but
 it is difficult to tell the difference
 from the outside.{Wimpey,}the builders
 provide the first time buyer with     
 fridge, cooker, washing machine and   
 carpets throughout.                   </content>
