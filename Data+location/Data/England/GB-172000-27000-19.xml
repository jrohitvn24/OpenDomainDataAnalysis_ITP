		<content> WINTER;In the winter at 8o'clock,the  
 first thing to do would be to feed the
 ewes and lambs,then the cattle.If     
 there was a milking herd this would   
 have to be brought in and milked and  
 fed .After this there are the odd jobs
 such as mending gates or hedges.Hourly
 checks the ewes if they are lambing   
 .Noon is lunch time until 1.30.The    
 afternoon is much the same until it is
 time to milk the cows and feed the    
 lambs,ewes and cattle again.          
 SPRING;During spring in the morning   
 get machinery ready for cutting       
 hedges,ploughing fields and spreading 
 dung.You would have to muck out the   
 cow house and pig house for muck      
 spreading.4.30 to 5.00 finish work.   
 SUMMER;In summer if the weather is    
 fine you would mow the grass for hay  
 and the corn if it was ripe,when the  
 lambs are fat they go to market.      </content>
