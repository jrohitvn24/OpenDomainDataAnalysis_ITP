		<title>01WEST BILNEY, CARRSTONE &amp; FEN</title>
		<content> Open, gently undulating greens and    
 countryside, large fields with some   
 hedges removed and forestry. Some     
 small areas of deciduous woodland     
 remain, Carrstone quarried until      
 recently, leaving pits, whose future  
 use is being discussed. Gravel is     
 quarried and much of this land is     
 bring relandscaped by Hoveringhams who
 recently won a prize for their        
 efforts. Migrating water birds now use
 these flooded areas in large number. A
 very rural area, half the block only  
 accessable by farmtracks. Agriculture 
 is the main industry, mainly cereals  
 and root vegetables. Each farmer jad  
 special diversification, cattle,      
 sheep,rhubarb, daffodils, turkey      
 rearing and rootstocks for roses      
 scattered houses, those in the centre 
 of the block originally estate housing
 for West Bilney Hall.                 </content>
