		<title>11CHEDDON FITZPAINE CHURCH</title>
		<content>  The church of St Mary the virgin is  
 believed to have been originally built
 in the late 1200's when the land was  
 owned by the Fitz-Payns.The church was
 restored in 1861.The pulpit and font, 
 with its bowl made of stone from Ham  
 Hill,are believed to date from Henry  
 VIII's time.The oldest gravestone is  
 from 1798.A plaque on the wall behind 
 the gate says "To the Glory of God,in 
 Memory of those of this parish who    
 died in the great war,1914-1918."     
  Funeral services cost Â£18, marriage  
 services Â£23 and a monument Â£38.There 
 is no fee for baptisms.               
  Cheddon has joined with the parishes 
 of Broomfield and Kingston St.Mary.So 
 the early family service will be held 
 at one church,Communion at another and
 Evensong at the third.The services are
 rotated each week.There are also mid- 
 week services and classes.            </content>
