           -------------               
   In 1978 ten men got together and    
 formed an organisation called Bradwell
 10.  The aim of this was to encourage 
 friendship and helpfulness in the     
 community.                            
   If they hear of anybody in need     
 they will give any help they can.  In 
 addition to this they raise money for 
 a variety of good causes - eg. the    
 Youth Club; the St. John's Ambulance  
 Brigade and the Memorial Hall Fund.   
   The ways in which they help         
 individuals are varied.  On one       
 occasion they helped a friend with    
 severe arthritis to scale Bradwell    
 Edge so that he could look down on his
 village again.  They have cleaned     
 Bradwell Brook out and they organise  
 the bonfire and firework display.
