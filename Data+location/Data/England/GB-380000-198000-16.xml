		<title>16Hilliers Pork Pie Factory.</title>
		<content>   First we were shown around the pork 
 pie and pasties' factory.We had to put
 on clean overalls and white caps.Then 
 we washed our hands before we went    
 into the factory.                     
   Pies are made from fresh pork and   
 pastry.The pastry is pressed into     
 shape inside a metal hoop.The meat is 
 placed in by a machine which also puts
 the lids on the pies.                 
   The automatic computerized pastry   
 roller rolls the pastry to a thickness
 of{3mm.}The rolls weigh about{15kg. } 
 Next,we were shown the room where the 
 pies were cooked.There are{2}big ovens
 which are pre-heated to{360 degrees   
{centigrade.}In each oven there are big
 carousels.There is one oven for pies  
 and one for pasties.                  
   When the pies have been cooled jelly
 is injected into them.After this they 
 are wrapped and packed ready for sale.</content>
