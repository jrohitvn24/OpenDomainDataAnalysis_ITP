		<title>09Farm Development in Codford</title>
		<content> Mr.Stratton owns most of the land in  
 our area.His uncle rented the farm in 
 1930 and Mr Stratton bought it in     
 1950.  Before 1930 ten men milked 100 
 cows by hand. In 1930 with a new      
 milking machine 3 men milked 80 cows  
 and by 1946 2 men milked 100 cows. In 
 1975 with more new machinery 2 men    
 milked  200 cows ,but in 1985 1 man   
 milks 160 cows by using yet another   
 new machine.                          
 In 1930 most of the farm land was used
 for rearing sheep and cows but now two
 thirds of the ground grows wheat and  
 crops.When Mr Stratton was young there
 were very few tractors around.They    
 were very hard to start up in the     
 morning and they had no cabs,so the   
 drivers got wet but now they have     
 insulated cabs and they have air vents
 and walkie talkies connected to the   
 farm telephone.                       </content>
