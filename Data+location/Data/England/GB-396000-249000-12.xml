		<content>   A conservation area of just over 1  
 acre is to be established at the end  
 of Moat Farm Lane. Orchids are found  
 here as it is quite boggy with a large
 pond.                                 
   Along the bridleway from the end of 
 Broad Lane leading to the church is an
 extensive badgers set which extends   
 into the fields on the eastern side   
 and has several entrances and exits.  
 The number of rabbits and foxes appear
 to be increasing as does the number of
 magpies, pigeons and pheasants. Since 
 the reservoirs and ponds have been    
 cleared and improved Canada geese have
 been seen in the area. There are also 
 reports of greater numbers of frogs   
 and toads.                            
   During 1985 an oil pipe-line from   
 Southampton to the Midlands has been  
 laid through the area in a north/south
 direction.                            </content>
