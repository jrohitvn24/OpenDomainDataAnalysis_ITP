		<content> Farming is in fact the main occupation
 of the people in the area.It is mainly
 hill sheep farming but there are a few
 dairy and one chicken farm.The nearest
 animal markets are at Penistone and   
 Bakewell where the farmers sell their 
 products.There is a small area of     
 arable land where turnips and potatoes
 are grown and some grass is cut for   
 sileage.                              
 At present,hill sheep is a profitable 
 activity since there is a generous    
 subsidy.                              
 A hamlet called {Loadbrook}consists of
 a renovated farmhouse and connected   
 outbuildings,and across the road,a    
 leased farm which is more productive  
 than the farm owner's holding.
