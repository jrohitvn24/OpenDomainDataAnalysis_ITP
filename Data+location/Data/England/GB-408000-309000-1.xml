		<title>01 School Weather Station</title>
		<content>    Christ Church School has a weather 
station to allow the children to study 
the weather data. In 1974, it arrived  
in kit form. There were hundreds of    
pieces and it had to be sent to a      
secondary school to be built. In 1982  
a sundial was given to the school as a 
present by a stonemason who wanted to  
say thank you for his daughter's       
education. Mr. Burton is in charge of  
the weather study so Class 3 help him. 
These are some of the interesting      
facts that we found out:The highest    
wind speed recorded is 39 mph on the   
3/3/82. The max. temperature is 34     
Celsius, and the min. is -17           
Celsius.The. max. rainfall recorded in 
1 day is 68.8mm. The weather is taken  
at noon each day. Once we helped the   
police to find out how much rainfall   
there was as someone had had a crash.
