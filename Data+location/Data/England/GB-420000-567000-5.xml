		<content>  In our area there are a large number 
 of recreational facilities including  
{sports grounds}and large public       
{playing fields.}There are also{clubs  
 for sports such as squash,golf,bowls  
 and boxing.For younger children there 
 are{adventure playgrounds}and several 
 open spaces have{climbing frames}or   
 swings.From a survey of 54 children it
 was clear that the majority spent     
 their leisure hours in{unorganised    
{activities,}the most popular being    
 football,tennis,swimming,jogging and  
 B.M.X.riding.For the few who used     
 facilities like swimming pools,sports 
 halls and ice-rinks,they had to{travel
{outside the area.}However,pupils can  
 travel on buses and the Metro for only
 5p.Only 25% attended{Youth Clubs.}At  
 these,discos,breakdancing and         
 gymnastics were popular.Very few      
 pupils attended Scouts or Guides.     </content>
