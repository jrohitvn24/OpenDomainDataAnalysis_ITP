 Mr.Blaikie or Paul Waite usually play 
 the organ.The Church has services once
 a week.The Church has a choir, uestry 
 the vicar's uestry and a tower uestry.
   The Church was rebuilt in 1892 by   
  C. Hodgson Fowler except for the base
 of the tower which is probably 13th.  
 century. The tall spire with its gold 
 coloured weathercock is a good
