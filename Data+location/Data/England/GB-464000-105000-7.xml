		<title>07Collyer's Pit</title>
		<content>  The Collyer's Pit is a tiny hollow   
 almost hidden on the side of Portsdown
 Hill. In the old days flints were dug 
 there and used to build several local 
 churches including St. Mary's Church, 
 Portsea. A handful of people live in  
 the 18th Century flint cottages with  
 their 14 inch thick walls and their   
 two up, two down rooms. There is also 
 some modern development. In the middle
 of a modern community it is, in some  
 ways, an isolated life. The dustman   
 call regularly, but the residents were
 snowed in for five days early in 1985 
 and the children have to go two miles 
 to the nearest school.                
  The remains of the similar, but      
 deeper Candy's Pit can be seen just   
 West of the London Road near the top  
 of the hill.
