		<title>10Grinhams Coal Merchants</title>
		<content>  Grinham coal comes from{Wales.} It   
 comes in three times a week and is    
 delivered to their depot. They mainly 
 deliver it to country houses.  It's   
 normally used for{domestic purposes   
 and is delivered all over the area.   
 They have plenty of competition with  
 other dealers and their nearest       
 competitor is P.D.Fuels.  They have   
 four people as staff, three permanent 
 and one part time.  They have two     
 lorries of their own and they are     
 delivering all week.  The business    
 has been there{80 yrs,}but they have  
 only had it for 15 yrs.               
  There is an office in{Sparrows Green,
{Wadhurst,}because it is more          
 convenient for them.  The depot at is 
 unmanned at Bells Yew Green.  It is   
 conveniently close to Frant Station.
