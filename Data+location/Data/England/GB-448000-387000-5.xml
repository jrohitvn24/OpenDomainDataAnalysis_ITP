		<content> We wanted to find out where people    
 from Thurcroft worked.We asked 182    
 people to get these results.          
 We found that 67% of our sample worked
 less than 5 miles from home.The       
 journey to work was less than 10      
 minutes for 39% of them and between 10
 and 30 minutes for 45%.We also asked  
 them how they got to work.The answers 
 were that 27% walked,40% used their   
 own transport,24% used public         
 transport and 9% of them used company 
 transport.                            
 These figures told us that most people
 worked within the local area and had  
 short journeys to work.A large number 
 walked to work.These were mainly      
 miners or people who worked within    
 Thurcroft(for example school cleaners 
 and kitchen staff,shop assistants and 
 workers on the local industrial       
 estate).                              </content>
