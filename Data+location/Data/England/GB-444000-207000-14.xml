		<title>14Wytham Abbey</title>
		<content> It is doubtful if Wytham Abbey was    
 ever an abbey. It was a private estate
 owned by the Earls of Abingdon, and   
 was restored early in the 19th Century
 Now it is a collection of flats owned 
 by Oxford University. Outside, it     
 seems an attractive 17th Century      
 building, but inside it is a warren of
 corridors and appartments. The        
 staircase from Cumnor Place, down     
 which Amy Robsart fell to her death,  
 is there, but the private path along  
 which the ffenells, the last owners,  
 walked to church, is gone. Trees hide 
 their graves in the Abbey grounds.    
 Some of the old family servants still 
 live in their quarters around the     
 northern courtyard, but the stables   
 are in decay and the meat house is    
 empty. The Abbey has become a quiet,  
 sombre place, keeping its own secrets,
 the echoing halls defying modern times</content>
