		<content>Edenbridge and the surrounding area is 
mainly on Wealden clay. The highest    
point is 93 metres above sea level and 
the lowest point is 45 metres above sea
level.As the clay is impervious there  
are numerous ponds and streams.  These 
support lots of plants such as Water-  
lilies; birds such as coots and        
mallards and insects such as Pond      
Scatters and dragon flies. The area is 
quite rich in wild life. Birds,        
animals, plants and trees flourish     
very well. This shows that the soil    
can support plenty of wild life and is 
ideal for farming. There are lots of   
cultivated plants and trees such as    
Pines.                                 
The industry in Edenbridge does not    
support much wild life apart from the  
sewage works which is a rich source of 
wild life especially birds.
