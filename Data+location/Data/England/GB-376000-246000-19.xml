		<content> We interviewed 40 people.35% were     
 under 25,33% were 25-50 and 35% were  
 50+.The majority of people shopped in 
 Malvern.Most of these used Malvern    
 Link 31% of the people shopped during 
 the week and others shopped at        
 weekends.33% shopped twice a week,22% 
 people shopped three times a week,30% 
 shopped once a week.Six people spent  
 under Â£10.00 on shopping,11 people who
 spent Â£10-Â£20,14 people spent Â£20-Â£40 
 and 8 people spent more than Â£40.00.  
 The majority of the people thought    
 that Malvern is adequate for shopping.
 But some thought that Malvern needed  
 more general stores.If people were    
 unable to find the items they needed  
 in Malvern they would travel to the   
 nearest large shopping area which is  
 situated six miles away in Worcester.
