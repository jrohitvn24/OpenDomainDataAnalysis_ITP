		<title>11BRANT BROUGHTON CRICKET CLUB</title>
		<content> The Brant Broughton Cricket Club has  
 had a chequered career. The earliest  
 record we have is a set of accounts   
 for 1927.We found out from these that 
 the groundsman was paid 14/-(70p) each
 time he prepared the ground, which was
 then on a meadow to the west of the   
 church. A cricket ball in that year   
 cost 14/6(75p) whereas today it costs 
 about Â£9.A cricket bat cost Â£2-2-0.   
   The club ceased in 1939,but it seems
 to have started up again later in the 
 war.It ceased for the second time in  
 1964 for reasons unknown.It was formed
 for the third time in 1967 but was    
 disbanded the following year.In 1980  
 the club was started up again for the 
 fourth time and is still functioning  
 now. The present club belongs to two  
 leagues - the Grantham Rural League   
 and the Newark Evening League - and it
 plays friendly matches.               </content>
