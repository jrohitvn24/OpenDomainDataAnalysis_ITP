		<content> Recently the 11th Earl has reinstated 
{DAFFODIL SUNDAY.}The grounds are open 
 to the public for one Sunday in April 
 when the multitude of daffodils are in
 full bloom.The money raised is donated
 to two Charities of the Earls choice. 
 Pinch Furlong Wood is so named because
 a previous Earl 'pinched' the paddock,
 belonging to the keeper at Keepers    
 Cottage,for planting.                 
 During the second World War,fields    
 from Newnham Lodge Farm were used to  
 create a{'Dummy' Coventry Airfield,}&amp; 
 consequently many bombs were dropped  
 here.Whilst ploughing,the present     
 farmer still finds pieces of shrapnel.
 The stream running through the estate 
 flows into the Oxford canal,but it has
 no name.At one point it passes under  
 Folly Bridge,which has three small    
 arches &amp; a narrow cattle grid still in
 place alongside the track.            </content>
