 most of the town of Horsham. The      
 survey was completed by the following 
 schools Tanbridge House Comprehensive;
 Heron Way, Northolmes,Greenway,St     
 Marys CofE(primary schools)and St     
 Leonards Infants. Horsham's pop. is   
 nearly 36,000. It has saxon origins   
 and retains its old centre. Modern    
 Horsham has expanded rapidly since    
 1960 and has attracted scientific and 
 technological based industry. It      
 serves as a commuter town for London. 
 New housing estates have grown up and 
 further development will follow with  
 future expansion at Gatwick Airport.  
 Horsham is the administrative centre  
 for Horsham District and is the       
 shopping and commercial centre for    
 surrounding villages.
