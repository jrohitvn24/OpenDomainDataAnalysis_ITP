		<title>07The Hamilton Local Plan  1</title>
		<content> In 1971 Leicestershire County Council 
 started planning ahead for the next 20
 years. It was preparing a{structure   
{plan}to consider, amongst other       
 things, the housing needs of the      
 1980's. The national census provided  
 much of the information and suggested 
 a future need for a large number of   
 homes in the city of Leicester. The   
 council felt that the area to the     
 north-east of Leicester would be      
 suitable. The area to be developed    
 would stretch from Keyham Lane,       
 Humberstone, in the south, to         
 Thurmaston in the west, to Barkby     
 Thorpe and part way to Queniborough in
 the north and to Beeby in the east.   
 The Minister of the Environment agreed
 in principle to the plans and asked   
 that a more detailed plan be prepared.
