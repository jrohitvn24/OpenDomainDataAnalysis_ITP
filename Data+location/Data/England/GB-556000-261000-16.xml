		<title>16GOODWIN FARM</title>
		<content> Goodwin Farm has 100 acres of land. It
 is divided into sections for different
 crops. The farmer, Mr. Easy, farms    
 wheat, beans, oil seed rape and       
 barley. In the fields they have tram  
 lines where the tractor runs through  
 so it can spray the crops. In a big   
 shed there are two corn bins to put   
 the corn in when it has been cut. Mr. 
 Easy has got a combine harvester to   
 cut the corn. This year it will be cut
 in the first week of August owing to  
 the bad weather making the harvest    
 late. Goodwin Farm was part of the    
 Goodwin Estate. Mr. Easy, the farmer  
 has been farming for 43 years. He     
 started farming when he was 14 years  
 of age. He works the land mainly      
 alone.
