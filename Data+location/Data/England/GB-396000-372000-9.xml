 The residents enjoy most of the       
 facilities that town dwellers would   
 with the exception of gas, mains      
 sewage and water.  The water is from  
 private bore holes and springs which  
 occasionally dry up in the summer.    
 There are no shops or deliveries and  
 very little public transport. There is
 a summer bus service which passes     
 through the area several times a week.
 The children travel long distances to 
 school, the school bus picking them up
 early in the morning thus making a    
 long day.  The village school closed  
 20 years ago.                         
                                       
 The women are very capable homemakers 
 and the families are community minded.
