		<title>01CLEADON,BOLDON AND WHITELEAS</title>
		<content> The area is a pleasant mixture of     
 housing and farmland.Land cover is 50%
 residential,50% farm use which because
 of its distribution gives a rural     
 flavour to the scene generally.       
    The main residential areas are:    
{a)Whiteleas and Cleadon Park}which are
 large council estates,made up of      
 terraced and semi-detached houses,    
 bungalows,maisonettes and a small     
 number of flats.                      
{b)Cleadon and East Boldon}which are   
 areas of private housing.Although     
 these houses are mainly semi-detached 
 or terraced,there are many examples of
 individually-styled detached          
 buildings.                            
    The green belt between this area   
 and Sunderland is in danger of being  
 eaten away by new building programmes.
 .  The farming area includes a dairy  
 farm,some mixed farming,and piggeries.</content>
