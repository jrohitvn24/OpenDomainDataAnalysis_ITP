		<title>02DOWNHAM SCHOOL FOR DISABLED</title>
		<content>    Downham{School}was opened in 1963. 
 There are 70 pupils; 14 of these stay 
 overnight in the{school hostel.}The   
 children start full time from about 4 
 years old.                            
    The teachers aim to prepare the    
 children for the outside world. When  
 the children leave school they are    
 either 16 or, if the{teachers}and     
 parents think the child would benefit 
 from another three years of schooling,
 they stay on until 19. They usually go
 on to an adult{training centre.}Taxis,
 minibuses and parents' cars are used  
 to transport the children to and from 
 school.                               
    The main{disabilities}are spina    
 bifida, mongolism and brain damage.   
    The school has its own scout group,
 youth club and a heated pool in a     
 fibreglass dome. It is a very happy   
 place with everyone very friendly.    </content>
