		<content>Middleton garage sells old and new cars
There is a workshop with 3 mechanics &amp; 
spare parts are sold.They do not sell  
petrol or sweets,nor do they have a car
wash.About 325 cars a year are sold,the
best selling model in 1985 being the   
Montego.It is a British Leyland        
franchise,with hire service.It cost    
them 300 pounds to be linked by 'phone 
to the B.L. computer for car ordering. 
                                       
The family owned garage at Wilbarston  
opened in 1940 as a tin shed.In 1970 a 
cafe was built with 3 petrol pumps.The 
by-pass built in 1974 resulted in a    
slump in trade,and the cafe with one   
pump was closed.Today the garage has   
two employees,and opens for five and a 
half days a week.
