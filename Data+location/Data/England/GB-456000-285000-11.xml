		<title>11W.I. IN GILMORTON</title>
		<content> Gilmorton W.I. was re-formed in       
 1946,having been closed during the war
 years.In the immediate post-war years 
 it was a large institute but declined 
 in numbers during the 1970s.It        
 has,however,recently revived a little 
 and now has 23 members.               
 The Institute is part of the Avon     
 group of W.Is. and of the             
 Leicestershire and Rutland W.Is. It   
 meets on the first Wednesday of each  
 month except August.The meetings      
 consist of a short business           
 part,followed by a speaker of general 
 interest and then social time during  
 which refreshments are served.        
 Following the destruction of the      
 village hall by fire in 1984,the      
 Institute meets in the school library 
 or in members' homes.                 
 There is a similar but smaller and    
 more informal Homemakers' Group.      </content>
