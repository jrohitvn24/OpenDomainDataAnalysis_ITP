		<title>14PLAYGROUND GAMES,DRAYTON</title>
		<content>  There are a great number of games    
 played  in the play ground,most of    
 which involve 1 child being{"It",}the 
 person who calls the moves or who has 
 to be beaten.The choice of "It" is    
 done either by common consent or by a 
 short race.                           
  There are many forms of{"He"}where   
 one person has to catch others,who are
 then "It";in{"Bulldog"}those who are  
 caught become catchers until only one 
 child is left.Games like{"Pompom"     
 involve the defence of a place against
 "attackers" who hide themselves until 
 the last moment to avoid detection.   
    There are also numerous games which
 involve{skipping ropes}as well as     
{elastic}stretched between the legs of 
 two players.The games are too detailed
 to be explained fully, but all have   
 origins dating back to the playgrounds
 of many years ago.                    </content>
