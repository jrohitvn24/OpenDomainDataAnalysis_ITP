		<title>07THE VILLAGE SHOP 2</title>
		<content> SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT COME TO THE   
 SHOP ON A REGULAR BASIS EACH WEEK.    
 OFTEN PEOPLE LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THINGS
 THAT HAVE HAPPENED IN THE VILLAGE.    
 BEING IN BUISINESS THE OWNERS         
 OF THE SHOP CAN NOT SAY WHAT THEY     
 THINK,THEY HAVE TO AGREE WITH THE     
 CUSTOMER.                             
                                       
 THIS PARTICULAR FAMILY HAVE BEEN IN   
 THE VILLAGE FOR OVER{100 YEARS.}THINGS
 USED TO BE VERY DIFFERENT THEN.FOR    
 INSTANCE,WHEN THE OWNER OF THE SHOP   
 WANTED TO SELL GOODS HE HAD TO WEIGH  
 EVERY THING ON SCALES. EVERYTHING USED
 TO BE DELIVERED IN BULK.HE USED TO    
 HAVE TO GET UP VERY EARLY TO BAKE     
 BREAD.THE SHOP OWNER FINDS MEASURING  
 IN KILOGRAMS VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE   
 WHEN HE WAS YOUNG EVERYTHING USED TO  
 BE IN POUNDS.                         
                                       </content>
