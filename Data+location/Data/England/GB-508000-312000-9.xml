		<title>09Villager of Baston</title>
		<content> The woman has lived in the{village}for
 16 years. She enjoys the quietness of 
 living in a village. There are four   
 people living in the house.           
 Herself,husband and two children. She 
 is an auxiliary nurse and her husband 
 is a crane driver. Because she works  
 in Peterborough she needs a car to get
 to work but feels a car is essential  
 living in Baston. There are quite a   
 lot of bazaars and fetes in the       
 village frome time to time;these are  
 well attended. The atmosphere in the  
 village is friendly and the residents 
 don't mind{newcomers.}The only changes
 which have occured in the village are 
 the building of the Cardyke Drive     
 estate and the expansion of Kirkstone 
 House School. She{shops}mainly in     
 Bourne but uses the village shops     
 also because they are convenient.
