       To reach the area and cover     
 distances within, it is necessary to  
 be a motorist or, at the very least,  
 be on two wheels.  Turning off the    
 A43 between Oxford and Northampton and
 following the signposts is to enter   
 another world of almost traffic-free  
 roads, apart from the occasional car  
 (inevitably belonging to a local), or 
 tractor.  Only television aerials are 
 a reminder of 2Oth century life.      
 There are no shops, no schools, no    
 traffic lights, no garages, no        
 double-yellow parking lines, no bus   
 service and, most striking of all, no 
 pedestrians on foot between villages. 
 The vast empty acres serve to         
 emphasise the screech of British and  
 American jet age air traffic overhead.
