		<content>   The site of Mr. Cook's farm goes    
 back many centuries. Parts of the     
 house date back 300 years. Mr. Cook   
 has lived here for ten years.         
   Today it is a busy dairy farm of 180
 acres. There are 14 fields, of which 3
 are hay, 3 are silage and the rest are
 permanent pasture. They have 35       
 Fresian cows which are milked twice a 
 day. They produce, on average, 500    
 litres of milk a day which is taken by
 bulk tanker to Stroud Creamery. They  
 also have 160 sheep and 70 cattle     
 which they fatten for sale at         
 Gloucester market. They produce about 
 1000 bales of straw, 2000 bales of    
 hay a year and sufficient silage for  
 winter feed for the cows.             
   They like their cows best and each  
 one has a name - the favourites are   
 Dolly and Minny.
