		<content>{    Mannington Farm is typical of the 
 network of small farms which cover the
 area of S.Heathland which once covered
 most of SE Dorset stretching from     
 Wimborne in the the West to the banks 
 of the Solent in the East.This area of
 heathland was largely man created,much
 of it was also forested the biggest   
 streches of Forest lying in the area  
 of the present New Forest borders.    
   Since the turn of the century more  
 and more of this heathland formely    
 only had two uses timber and grazing  
 has been converted to permanent       
 pasture for dairy farming or to fields
 for arable crops.This trend has       
 continued up to the present date      
 making the pockets of heathland       
 smaller and smaller to the extent that
 some now need to be protected as      
 reserves or sights of special         
 scientific interest.(See Holt Heath)  </content>
