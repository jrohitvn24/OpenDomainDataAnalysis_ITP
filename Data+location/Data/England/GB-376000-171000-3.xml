		<title>03FARMING IN MARSHFIELD CONTD.</title>
		<content> None of the farms in this area milk   
 dairy cows.  Some small-holdings -    
 from two to ten acres - exist with    
 goats, hens and geese.  A portion is  
 used by two horticulturalists for root
 crops.  The winter of 1984/5 was very 
 severe at times, temperatures being   
 well below freezing on many occasions.
 This affected winter sown crops.      
 Spring and early summer were wet and  
 very little hay was made in good      
 condition.  The big bale silage was   
 more popular and enabled winter feed  
 to be harvested.  The grain harvest   
 was late but a fine spell in Septemer 
 allowed the combines to get most of   
 the crops in.  The bushel weight is   
 light this season due to the extreme  
 wet.
