		<title>01GENERAL GUIDE TO BITTESWELL.</title>
		<content> Our twelve squares are mainly         
 fields,and it is only in the middle of
 them that there is some housing and   
 warehouses.                           
 There are quite a few farms within the
 block.                                
 The M.1. motorway runs North/South    
 through our block.                    
 There are a few spinneys but no real  
 woods in our block.                   
 There is one complete                 
 village,Bitteswell,and a part of the  
 market town of Lutterworth.           
 Bitteswell is small,with many old     
 houses,two pubs,a post office,and a   
 church.It has a school dating from the
 1840s.                                
  At its centre is a large green with  
 an enormous copper beech tree.        
 Modern housing estates join it with   
 Lutterworth.
