		<title>09The A.38 Plympton St.Mary.</title>
		<content>  This road was opened in the mid'70s  
 to relieve congestion through small   
 villages.Until then Plymouth was      
 poorly served with decent main roads. 
  It provides the{main artery for }    
{traffic}from West Devon and Cornwall, 
 to Exeter,Bristol,London,The Midlands 
 and beyond.                           
  It has had{profound effects on farms 
{and farming,}splitting them or making 
 them uneconomic by swallowing up      
 valuable agricultural land.           
  However because of the ease of travel
 a{small restaurant}has been set up at 
 the Smithaleigh Flyover and the local 
 farm has seen fit to erect a{small    
{motel.                                
  The road is often packed solid with  
 cars or caravans during the summer    
 months as the{tourists}flock to       
 Cornwall or the Roscoff Ferry.
