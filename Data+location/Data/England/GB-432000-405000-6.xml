 various groups.Children go to craft   
 and outdoor clubs as well as Brownies 
 and Cubs.Young people go to youth     
 clubs, Guides and Scouts.

 as they like organising meetings and  
 rallies. Some women go to keep fit and
 dancing clubs. There are a lot of     
 Mother and Toddler groups and slimming
 clubs.

 clubs and many go to the Darby and    
 Joan Club.
