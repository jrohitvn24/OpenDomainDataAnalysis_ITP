		<title>20LAW AND ORDER IN SUTTON</title>
		<content> There has never been a Police Station 
 in Sutton.In the past,the village     
 policeman would ride through the      
 village on his bicycle.Nowadays,the   
 police drive through the village in   
 Panda cars.Sometimes policemen visit  
 the school to talk to the children    
 about road safety and other matters   
 concerning children's welfare.The     
 Police Force responsible for looking  
 after Sutton is based at Biggleswade  
 Police Station.                       
                                       
                                       
   Research for the Domesday Project   
 on Sutton and the surrounding area    
 conducted by the children of Sutton   
 Lower School.
