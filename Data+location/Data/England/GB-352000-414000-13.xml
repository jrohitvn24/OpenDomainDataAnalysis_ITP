		<title>13Life in Charnock Richard</title>
		<content>Charnock Richard is a small village    
surrounded by flat, fertile            
countryside. Most is grassland and     
trees. There is abundant wild-life.    
On nice days you can go for walks.     
There are two schools, a new primary   
school and the former village school,  
now used for playschool, youth-club    
and clinic. Discos are held in the new 
school once a fortnight.  There are    
football teams for all ages, guides,   
Brownies, Scouts and Cubs. a Rambling  
Club and a Gardening Club.  Many events
are connected with the church such as  
Walking Day and Fairs and Fetes.  The  
shops are Brennands greengrocers and   
florists, The Mini-Market, The Post    
Office, Harold's grocers and a         
Hairdressing Parlour.  The pubs are    
The Dog and Partridge, The Hind's Head 
and The Bowling Green. We have a       
funfair at Park Hall called Camelot.   </content>
