 where you can buy rubbers, stickers,  
 badges and crafted gifts.             
    The shops mainly sell to the       
 tourists. There are four antique shops
 selling furniture, clocks, coins,     
 pottery and glass. There are three    
 snack bars where you can have light   
 snacks and three restaurants. There   
 are 17 pubs, inns, hotels and wine    
 bars.
