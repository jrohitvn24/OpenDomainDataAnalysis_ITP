		<title>17"My Day", by a farmer's son</title>
		<content>   "I have to get up between 5.30a.m.  
 and 6.30a.m. to get the cows in for   
{milking,}then I come in at 7.15 a.m.  
 I have to{feed the calves}twice a day 
 in Winter. In the Spring I have to{bed
{the heifers}daily. Usually we let the 
 cows out in Spring and bring them in  
 in late Autumn. They have to eat      
 silage in Winter, but this Summer we  
 are feeding them on silage and grass, 
 although most summers we feed them on 
 grass only. Last year we started to   
 have three cuts of grass for silage,  
 instead of two.In the Winter, just    
 before dinner, I have to fill the     
 barrow up with a{special feed of waste
{sugar and maize.}I get the cows in    
 from the fields at night at 5.00 p.m. 
 for{evening milking,}and finish about 
 5.30.p.m."
