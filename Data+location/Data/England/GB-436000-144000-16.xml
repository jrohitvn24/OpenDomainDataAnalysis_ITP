   P.C.Hayward came to see us about    
 stealing because we had a robbery     
 yesterday.                            
   Someone had stolen our video.The    
 robber made a hole in the window went 
 in got the video and went.            
 A policeman came to see what          
 happened,a finger print man came to   
 'find' some finger prints in the      
 library so they could find out who    
 done it.                              
   They broke in through the window and
 my mum cleaned up the glass so nobody 
 would cut theirself.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
