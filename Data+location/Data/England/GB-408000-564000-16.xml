		<title>16ENTERTAINMENT IN WYLAM</title>
		<content>  There is quite a lot of entertainment
 in Wylam for it's size. For people who
 are under 18 there is very little to  
 do at night or throughout the day.    
 About every six months there is a     
 disco at the Institute but there is   
 little else. There is a railway museum
 in Wylam which is quite interesting.  
 For people over 18 there are four pubs
 in Wylam (q.v.) all of which are      
 popular. There are also many other    
 clubs you can join such as drama,     
 tennis, football, badminton, cricket, 
 etc.. For the 16 year olds there is a 
 music band but as yet unheard of. With
 Wylam not being far from the city of  
 Newcastle (about 10.5 miles) you can  
 easily drive there or get other       
 transport for entertainment.
