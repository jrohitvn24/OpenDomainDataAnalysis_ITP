		<title>07SPALDWICK BY-PASS</title>
		<content> Spaldwick village had two dangerous   
 bends resulting in many accidents     
 because there is a lot of traffic on  
 the A6O4. A new by-pass was built in  
 record time and opened in summer1982. 
 It has made a big difference to the   
 village which is now peaceful. For the
 first few months after the opening    
 trade in the shops and garage  was    
 affected ,but they didn't take out    
 any more advertising.Signs were       
 erected on the by-pass to show that   
 there is a cafe and garage in the     
 village .The trades people are not    
 pleasd with the lost trade but        
 think the by-pass  is a good thing    
 .some lorries still pass  through the 
 village.
