		<title>01Farmland on Brendon Hills</title>
		<content> This block comrises open farmland used
 for grazing mostly sheep and some     
 cattle.  There is a network of minor  
 roads throughout the area.  It is very
 hilly terrain, quite steep in places  
 with scattered farms over the land.   
 There are patches of woodland, small  
 groups of deciduous trees to the west 
 of the block, but larger areas of     
 coniferous trees in the east.  The    
 roads are lined with high beech hedges
 in many places with broad ditches     
 alongside.  None of te listed         
 amenities                             
 are present in this block, and there  
 is no bus service existing at the     
 present time.
