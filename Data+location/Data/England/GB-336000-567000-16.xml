		<title>16TRANSPORT/LONGTOWN,CUMBRIA</title>
		<content> Longtown has a surprising number of   
 Road-Haulage Contractors for a town of
 its size.In 1985 there were four      
 medium sized firms operating fleets of
 lorries.The reasons for this situation
 are various.Proximity to the motorway 
 system and major trunk routes of the  
 Borders.The need to transport large   
 quantities of timber from the         
 soft-wood forests,collection of milk  
 from farms,and the carriage of large  
 numbers of cattle and sheep.All of the
 companies are long established,and    
 have built up much good-will with     
 their customers over the years,and as 
 a result there has been minimal       
 cutbacks in the numbers of vehicles   
 operating during the current          
 recession.The innovatory techniques of
 using plastic pipes for drainage in   
 agriculture has created a large       
 increase in business for one firm.    </content>
