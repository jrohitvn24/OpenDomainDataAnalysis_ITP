		<content> In recent years Norton-on-Derwent has 
 become famous as a centre for training
 race horses and this has earned it the
 title of the "Newmarket of the North".
 The connection with racing dates back 
 to 1736 and although nationally known 
 as "Malton" trainers, nearly all of   
 them are located in Norton-on-Derwent.
                                       
 Some of the most spirited horses in   
 the country have, or are, trained over
 the gallops at the Langton Wold and   
 Highfield training grounds on the edge
 of Wolds. It is a common sight to see 
 race horses being exercised around the
 town and each morning strings of race 
 horses can be seen through the town as
 they are taken from their stables to  
 the training areas.                   
                                       
 Horse racing is not carried on in the 
 town.                                 </content>
