		<title>18FARMING.Woodbine Farm.</title>
		<content>      Woodbine Farm,which is owned by  
 Mr.Frank King,is situated in the small
 village of Fairseat.The farm is fairly
 small,about 28 acres in size.Some of  
 the land is rented to another farmer  
 for grazing.The rest of the land is   
 used to grow most types of soft       
 fruit,including a few whitecurrants   
 which is rather unusual.              
    Most of the fruit is picked by the 
 customer,(this makes it much less     
 expensive,)although Mr King employs   
 some casual labour in the picking     
 season.The customers are mainly local 
 coming from the nearby villages of    
 Culverstone and Vigo.                 
   Mr King works the farm himself with 
 the help of two ladies who work part  
 time throughout the year.At one time  
 most of the villagers worked on local 
 farms but nowadays with modern farming
 methods far fewer do.                 </content>
