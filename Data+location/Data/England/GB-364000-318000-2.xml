		<title>02The Changes in Tibberton.</title>
		<content>     In Tibberton there are some       
 17th century houses, but most of the  
 old village was built during the l9th 
 century,when Tibberton was owned by   
 the{Duke of Sutherland.}Sutherland    
 estate cottages have pointed gables   
 and most of the modern houses are     
 designed the same way.                
                                       
     At that time Tibberton had four   
 farms and eight cottages, but in the  
 l950's{Maslan Crescent,}forty two     
 semi-detached houses, was built by the
 District Council.                     
                                       
     From l964 onwards Tibberton chang-
 ed. First many bungalows were built,  
 and then new roads of modern houses.  
                                       
    {Newport}is the local town for     
 shopping, doctor, and secondary       
 schools.                              </content>
