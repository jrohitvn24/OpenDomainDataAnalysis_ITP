		<content>   The geology of the area and the     
 management of the land are the major  
 influences on the flora and fauna.It  
 is only in the valley bottoms and     
 streamsides that vegetation is able to
 reach a normal type,with alder        
 dominating the river banks.           
   The soils are acid and shallow      
 overlying sandstone with varied sand  
 and gravel glacial deposits.The area  
 therefore is a patchwork of small     
 pockets of soil,though all are of poor
 potential.The normal climax vegetation
 would be silver birch and pine trees  
 or sessile oak with an undergrowth of 
 heather,bracken and bilberry.         
   Forestry is an obvious use of land  
 which is very exposed,especially the  
 steep-sided valleys.The potential for 
 any form of high productivety farming 
 is poor as the soil is suitable only  
 for low grazing.                      </content>
