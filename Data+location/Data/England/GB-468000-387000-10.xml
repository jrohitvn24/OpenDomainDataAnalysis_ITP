 Mr Swindon is Mattersey's blacksmith  
 and farrier. His grandfather was      
 the blacksmith before him. Mr Swindon 
 was 15 years old when he started, the 
 first 5 years working for a man in    
 Tuxford followed by 11 years          
 working for himself. He works 8 hours 
 a day and shoes about 20-25 horses a  
 week. He makes about 4000 shoes a     
 year. For the village he has made the 
 church gates, weather vane to the old 
 vicarage, and the gate and railings   
 to the cemetery. He makes most of his 
 tools but some of them are bought such
 as his gas, anvils and clippers. He   
 works to a 30 mile radius, sometimes  
 travelling in the van.
