		<content> Even though Melton Mowbray is only a  
 small town, there is much to do in    
 one's spare time.                     
                                       
 Melton Mowbray has many clubs &amp;       
 societies which one can join. Besides 
 these Melton Mowbray has many         
 attractive parks &amp; sports grounds     
 owned by the Town Estate. Melton      
 Mowbray is also fortunate in having a 
 theatre &amp; sports complex completed    
 in 1976 as part of the College of     
 Further Education extensions. The     
 College of Further Education  also    
 provides many classes which take place
 either during the day or in the       
 evening.                              
                                       
 Also in Melton Mowbray is the Working 
 Men's Club,the British Legion Club,the
 Conservative Club, the Regal Cinema   
 and the Waterfield Swimming Baths.    </content>
