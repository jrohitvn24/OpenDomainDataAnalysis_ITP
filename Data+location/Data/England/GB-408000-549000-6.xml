		<content> My name is John.On Friday I got up    
 when the alarm went at 8.00 a.m. I    
 washed and dressed and had cornflakes 
 for my breakfast before going to      
 school at 8.45 a.m.                   
      I helped to get out the school   
 computer. It has to be locked away    
 each night in case we are burgled     
 again. Each class takes the computer  
 in turn. Our favourite program is     
{"Dare Devil Devil Denis"}and the      
 younger children like{"Trucks"}and    
{"Cat and Mouse".}We have lots of      
 spelling games too.                   
     I helped to put out the chairs for
 the infant Assembly.Our parents were  
 invited to join the children in their 
 assembly about{Noah and the Ark.      
    Some of us have started our own    
 anti-litter campaign called{K.A.T.S.Y.
 Keep a Tidy School Yard. We forget    
 sometimes and have to be reminded.    </content>
