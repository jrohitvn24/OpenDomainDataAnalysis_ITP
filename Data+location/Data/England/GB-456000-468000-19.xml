		<title>19Woodcarvers of Crayke</title>
		<content> Woodcarers of Crayke was started in   
 1967. For the first six years it was  
 situated in Mr Oliver Banks disused   
 Bakery. Then a new workshop was built 
 down Stillington Raod. The company has
 exported furniture to Japan,          
 Australia, America, Africa and most of
 Europe. Important jobs have been a    
 staircase for an Arab Sheik, tables   
 for Windsor Castle and a chair for the
 Queen and boardroom furniture for GEC.
 All the work is in English Oak and at 
 present time there is a work force of 
 four people. The furniture is sold    
 directly to the public from the       
 showrooms  that are built adjacent to 
 the workshops.
