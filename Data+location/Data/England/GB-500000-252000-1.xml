		<title>01Clapham and Oakley</title>
		<content> This area has been studied by Ursula  
 Taylor Lower School and Lincroft      
 Middle school, with contributions from
 Oakley Lower School.   It covers two  
 villages and the countryside in       
 between and around them.              
                                       
 Clapham is situated on the main A6    
 road and it has just been announced   
 that there will be a Clapham By-pass  
 in the near future.   Oakley is a mile
 further to the West.   The villages   
 are surrounded by agricultural land,  
 with woods, the River Ouse and a main 
 railway line on the outskirts.        
                                       
 The main buildings of consequence are 
 the two village churches, and Clapham 
 church has a fine Saxon tower which   
 can be seen from a distance dominating
 the area.
