		<title>09PRISTON VILLAGE LIFE</title>
		<content> Closure of the village school (16     
 years ago), the Post office and shop  
 (10 years ago) has affected village   
 life. Villagers miss the gathering of 
 parents outside the school gates and  
 the meeting of other people from      
 different villages/hamlets who used   
 the Post Office/shop.                 
  Children now travel to Markesbury and
 Farmborough for schooling. A bus is   
 provided for those children who go to 
 Markesbury, but those attending       
 Farmborough school travel by private  
 car. A few children go to private     
 schools.                              
  The school building has become the   
 village hall and is used for several  
 major events. Monthly "Ladies Evening"
 are held there as well as Country     
 Dancing and Morris Dancing.
