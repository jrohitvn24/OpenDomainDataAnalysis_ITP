		<content> In 1932 Welling High Street was very  
 narrow.There were very few cars then, 
 but today there are traffic jams.There
 were fewer  houses on one side of     
 Welling Way and Bellegrove Road.There 
 were only two main roads:Welling Way  
 and Bellegrove Road,and no            
 sideroads.The shops were planned but  
 not built.                            
 The milkman brought milk by horsecart 
 but today he uses an electric van.To  
 buy food and other things you walked  
 to Welling.Ice-cream was brought by a 
 man on a threewheeler cart.Now he uses
 a motorised van which plays a tune.   
 People moved into the area in 1932    
 for                                   
 the same reasons they do today-to get 
 bigger houses and gardens in a quiet  
 pleasant area near to London.
