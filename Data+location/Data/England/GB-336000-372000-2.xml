		<title>02Cooling Towers</title>
		<content> Prior to 1980 uranium enrichment at   
 B.N.F.L. was at the diffusion plant   
 with its 11 distinctive cooling towers
 Then the new E21 Centrifuge Plant came
 into operation with the same output   
 but 90% less energy consumption.In    
 1983 E22 with double its output began 
 production &amp; its twin E23 is under    
 construction.Together they are much   
 smaller than the old plant,are easily 
 extended &amp; require no large cooling   
 towers.The old towers are being       
 dismantled piecemeal as explosives    
 would affect the sensitive centrifuge 
 plant.The centrifuges are made and    
 assembled on site.In 1986 a new plant 
 will open making fuel for nuclear     
 submarines.The uranium hexafluoride   
 used in the enrichment process is     
 brought by road from BNFL's           
 Springfields Plant.Capenhurst         
 currently employs 2,200 people.       </content>
