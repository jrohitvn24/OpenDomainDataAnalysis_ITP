 This farm derives its name from a     
 particular type of causeway made from 
 brushwood and laid across bog or flood
 lands, it being at a place in the     
 flood lands of the Vale between       
 Yalding and Marden

 established land

 This farmhouse was originally two     
 cottages with a dairy which is now the
