		<title>07HACKLINGE AREA HOUSING</title>
		<content> The area as a whole is sparsely popu- 
 lated. There are seven places where   
 the houses are concentrated into      
 groups. Mill Lane and Jubilee Road in 
 Worth, Ham, Hacklinge, Finglesham,    
 Burgess Green and Betteshanger        
 Colliery. The more scattered houses   
 were often old farm houses and the    
 cottages connected with them.There are
 Council houses, flats and old people's
 bungalows in Jubilee Road and houses  
 at Burgess Green. The 100 houses at   
 the Colliery belong to the N.C.B.     
 There is little other tenanted        
 property. Two houses are empty and one
 is derelict. All but one house are    
 connected to main electricity. There  
 is no mains gas and about 25% of the  
 houses are connected to main drainage.
 Some Council houses are               
 owner-occupied.
