		<content> This is a rural area on               
 the edge of a zone of industrial      
 development in the Mid Mersey Valley  
 to the North, especially the expanding
 town of Warrington.                   
 There are some wooded areas, but the  
 land is used mainly for agriculture   
 both cereal farming and dairy         
 farming.                              
 The block is divided North to South   
 by the M6 motorway on the Thelwall    
 Viaduct over the Mersey and the       
 Manchester Ship Canal.  In the South  
 of the block much land is taken up    
 by the M6/M56 interchange.            
 The North East corner of the block    
 just includes the southern edge of    
 the dormitory village of Lymm.  The   
 North West corner of the block just   
 includes the southern edge of the     
 Warrington suburb of Grappenhall,     
 formerly a separate village..         </content>
