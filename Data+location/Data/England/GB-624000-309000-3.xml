		<content>  According to the results of our      
 surveys television viewing is the main
 leisure activity for the majority of  
 the population. The choice of         
 programmes varied enormously according
 to the age of the viewer. Most adult  
 men prefer to watch sport,gardening   
 and News programmes,while women favour
 the "Soap Operas".                    
  The favourite programme of the       
 majority of 12 year olds is"The Young 
 Ones" ,while the younger children     
 prefer "Grange Hill" or "Dallas".     
  Parents of younger children told us  
 that the under-fives like to watch    
 "Play School". "Postman               
 Pat" is the programme which the       
 younger boys seem to enjoy the most.  
  While many women complained that     
 there was too much sport on the       
 television most children thought there
 were too many News type programmes.   </content>
