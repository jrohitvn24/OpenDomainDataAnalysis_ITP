		<title>03SNOWDOWN_THE LAMPROOM.</title>
		<content>  In the lamproom you are not allowed  
 to smoke because of the gasses in     
 there. All the lamps are numbered so  
 that if you are missing you can be    
 easily identified.Every miner has a   
 life preserver which gives enough air 
 to last for one and a half hours, long
 enough to get to the nearest          
 ventilation place.                    
  All the miners are issued with dust  
 masks which have a filter to prevent  
 the dust going into their lungs.      
  When the miners finish their shift   
 the lamp batteries are put onto       
 charge. There is a dip beam for       
 talking to people so as not to dazzle 
 them.
