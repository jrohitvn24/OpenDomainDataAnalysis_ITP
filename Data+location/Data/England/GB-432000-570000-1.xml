		<title>01  MARDEN  QUARRY.</title>
		<content> The Quarry started in 1684 when it was
 leased for quarrying of limestone.It  
 was abandoned in the 19th century and 
 gradually filled up with water.It was 
 used as a stand by reservoir until    
 1975.It was decided to change the area
 into a park.North Tyneside Council    
 partly filled the lake to make it     
 shallow and created little islands and
 reed beds to attract nesting sites for
 waders and ducks.The rest of the park 
 was left in its natural state.        
 The mixture of grassland,hawthorn     
 scrub woodland  attract a             
 wide  variety of birds such as        
 Wigeon,Teal    and also Willow        
 Warbler,Treecreeper,    Pied          
 Flycatcher,Spotted Flycatcher.        
 Bird watchers have already sighted    
 rarer species such as Bluethroat,Red- 
 Backed  Shrike,Wryneck and Ring Ouzel.
