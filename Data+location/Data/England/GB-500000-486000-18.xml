		<content> In the school playground boys are     
 allowed to play with balls but they   
 must be made of sponge for safety     
 reasons. They play cricket and        
 football with them. The playground has
 two unofficial football pitches with  
 walls acting as goals. There are four 
 cricket pitches. The wickets drawn on 
 walls or drainpipes.                  
 Chasing games are popular and in one  
 which is called Fox and Hound the boys
 and girls chase each other and when   
 caught they are put in 'jail' where   
 they wait to be rescued. This can be  
 done by boys and girls who aren't     
 caught tigging (touching) the people  
 who are caught.
