		<title>04Old Longnor</title>
		<content>     Longnor is an old village.  It has
4 pubs and 2 cafes.  In the olden days 
it had about 12 pubs.  Longnor has a   
few historical buildings such as the   
church and town hall which is set on   
the cobbled market place.  The town    
hall has been repaired.  Longnor was   
said to be the smallest town in        
England.  In the eighteenth century the
church was burnt down but it is now    
rebuilt.                               
     Longnor is supposed to be haunted 
by ghosts.  People say that the        
headless horseman haunts the streets   
of Longnor and also Hollinsclough.     
There is supposed to be the ghost of   
the black dog roaming Mill Lane.       
     Longnor has an old saw mill which 
in the olden days was set on fire. The 
blame was put on some gypsies in the   
nearby field.
