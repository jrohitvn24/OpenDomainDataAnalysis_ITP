		<content> Obviously{Television}is a much        
 appreciated asset during the long,hard
 and isolated winters. This is doubly  
 so as reception is difficult to obtain
 due to the screening effect of the    
 high surrounding hills. Most houses   
 are connected to a privately owned    
 television aerial that is placed in   
 some high position on the surrounding 
 moors and then cabled down to the     
 various houses. These schemes (of     
 which there are 6) were organised,    
 financed and individually dug in      
 across the moors by the residents     
 concerned.                            
{Radio reception}may also be variable. 
{Newspapers}are delivered to Abbey     
 Stores from where they may be         
 collected.                            
 A number of people have {videos,}as   
 these are useful when reception is    
 poor.                                 </content>
