		<title>12ACTIVITIES,CLUBS,PAST-TIMES.</title>
		<content> There are very few activities in our  
 village but we still manage to find   
 lots of things to do.The boys go to   
 cubs and scouts whilst the girls go to
 brownies and guides.                  
 There are mixed clubs as well and many
 of the village children go to swimming
 &amp; tennis clubs.                       
 From a survey we did among our class  
 we found guides to be most popular for
 girls &amp; cricket for the boys.         
 Our parents play skittles, run guide  
 companies, go ballroom dancing and are
 members of the Indian Club. All these 
 are activites which take place outside
 the village.                          
 In the village there is a village hall
 where a Whist Club meets as does the  
 local W.I. and a playgroup.The local  
 pub has a darts &amp; quiz team.Villagers 
 find plenty to do but mainly outside  
 the village.                          </content>
