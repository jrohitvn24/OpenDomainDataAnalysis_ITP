 We went to Mrs Whites house which is  
 called White Cottage.It is 250 years  
 old and she had been living in it for 
 the last 18 years.It was once three   
 cottages used by farm workers.She said
 that it was not haunted.It had never  
 been thatched.The sitting and dining  
 rooms had beams and the doors had     
 latches.The house had two modern      
 rooms- the kitchen and a bedroom      
                     {Helen            
 The White House was built in 1474.It  
 was made from bricks and the roof was 
 covered with Swithland slate.There is 
 a rumour that the house has a passage 
 to Kirby Castle.We know it was used as
 an inn until the nineteenth century.  
 Inside you can see big timbers to hold
 up the roof.
