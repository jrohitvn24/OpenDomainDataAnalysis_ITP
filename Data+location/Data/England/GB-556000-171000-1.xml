		<content>   The Darenth/Bean area is largely    
 rural with grassland and woods.       
   There are distinct residential      
 settlements served by shops, schools, 
 public houses and churches.           
   The area is rich in minerals and    
 consequently there are quarries where 
 chalk is extracted for the            
 cement-making process.                
   The cement industry has a           
 significant impact on the local       
 economy but there is concern amongst  
 local residents about the ecological  
 effects of any further extension of   
 quarrying.                            
   Whilst some adults work in the local
 cement and paper-making industries,   
 many commute to London.  There is a   
 relatively high level of unemployment 
 due to the closure or modernisation   
 of local manufacturing industries.
