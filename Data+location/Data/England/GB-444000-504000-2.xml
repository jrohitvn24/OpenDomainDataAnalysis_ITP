		<content> Hutton Rudby has a main road.On either
 side there are big trees. Some of     
 these were Elms which had to be cut   
 down because they had Dutch Elm       
 Disease. They planted some more in    
 their place which were a Horse        
 Chestnut, a Beech, an Oak and a Rowan.
 Classes three and four went on Thurs 7
 March 1985 to the planting it was     
 lucky that all the trees on the green 
 were not all Elms because if they were
 Elms they would have all had to be cut
 down!                                 
 Leven House is one of the largest     
 houses in Hutton Rudby,it was built in
 1811. It's carved into window-sill.   
 The ceiling is about 5 metres high    
 with a pretty decoration. I think it  
 was the rectory originally even though
 it had a sign on the door saying "This
 is not the Rectory". It is for sale   
 now at Â£100,000.                      </content>
