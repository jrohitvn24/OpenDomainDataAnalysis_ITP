		<title>08BECKY'S INTERVIEW CONTINUED</title>
		<content> A.Two sisters delivered post in a     
 horse drawn cart.                     
 Q.What recreation was there?          
 A.Very little for girls and teenagers,
   but there was a Boys Brigade.       
 Q.What major changes can you remember?
 A.We got 2 private bus services and   
   a permanent place for the library,  
   before it was a tin hut.            
 Q.How did the wars affect the village?
 A.Very little indeed,you could hear   
   the planes going over to Bristol    
   and one bomb did drop in a field    
   outside the village.                
     It seems that until the develop_  
   ment of the motor_car and the roads,
   the village changed very little over
   the year.
