		<content> On our farm we have these             
 animals;dogs,cats,cows,calves and     
 sheep.We have six tractors and a      
 landrover.My dad gets up at 6.30 to   
 milk the cows and feed the calves.He  
 shouts to the cows in the summer when 
 they are in the fields(in winter they 
 are kept inside).My uncle Gerald comes
 to help dad milk the cows.My          
 grandfather feeds the calves with     
 powdered milk mixed with water. They  
 finish the milking at about 8.10 and  
 my uncle and grandfather go home for  
 breakfast.On a sunny day in July my   
 dad will be cutting hay to feed to the
 cows in winter.My grandfather feeds   
 the sheep with crushed barley,which we
 grow on the farm.The cows are milked  
 again in the evening. The milk tanker 
 comes once a day to take our milk from
 the bulk tank to Aspatria Creamery,to 
 be made into butter and cheese.       </content>
