		<title>16OUR POLICEMAN</title>
		<content>{The local policeman}was interviewed.  
{Community policing}is an idea to help 
 people and the police to get to know  
 each other better. At one time Panda  
 cars were used for patrols, but this  
 method lacked the personal touch. It  
 was decided that policemen could walk 
 or use a bicycle. By getting to know  
 you, the policeman will rely on you   
 and trust you and sometimes you can   
 help the police prevent crime. He     
 doesn't carry a gun. He receives      
 instructions through his radio. He has
 a lot of paperwork to do. Also he has 
 a crime file. He carries an accident  
 book, crime reports and a gun         
 certificate. If he needs assistance he
 can contact a patrol car or the C.I.D.
 He can get a police dog as well.
