		<title>11AGRICULTURE AROUND BROMYARD</title>
		<content> The afternoon routine,especially in   
 the winter,is to muck-out the         
 livestock. The rest of the afternoon  
 is spent doing maintenance and repairs
 around the farm.                      
    The two 24-hours-a-day, 7-days-a-  
 week jobs, are the lambing in the     
 Spring and the harvesting which takes 
 place in the latter part of the       
 Summer.                               
    In 1968, 16 more acres were bought 
 in addition to the fifty original     
 acres from the mid-1700s. The most    
 interesting change over the years has 
 been the change from shire-horses to  
 modern machinery.                     
    Mr Manzoni considers that his farm 
 is profitable, in the sense that he   
 earns enough to keep his family going,
 but not enough to expand his farm. All
 his capital is invested in the farm.
