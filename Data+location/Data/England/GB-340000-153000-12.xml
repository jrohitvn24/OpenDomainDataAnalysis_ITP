		<content>  In the Axbridge and Cheddar Valley   
 area{market gardening}is an important 
 occupation.                           
 On the slopes of the Mendips and lower
 ground you will find{'growers'}and    
 nursery men. The land is ideal for    
 this purpose. The 'moorland' found on 
 te levels is{peat}based. This is not  
 moss peat but sedge peat. The peat can
 be burnt but most is used by the      
 horticultural industry. It can be used
 to improve the soil structure or      
 (after being enriched with nutrients) 
 can be sealed in plastic bags. These  
 are given the name{'grow bags'.}Slits 
 are cut in the bags and plants such as
 tomatoes are planted in the peat.     
 In addition to the professional       
 growers you will often see small      
 roadside stalls selling surplus home  
 grown produce.                        
                                       </content>
