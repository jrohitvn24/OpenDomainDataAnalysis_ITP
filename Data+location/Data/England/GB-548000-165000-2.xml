		<content> No history has been written though    
 material is being gathered for one    
 now.It was not in the Domesday        
 Book.The earliest mention of          
 Crokornheld-the  slope on which stands
 a pottery- is in 1388.The medieaval   
 industry was of tile-making and Tylers
 Green is a very old road name .It     
 remained a hamlet with extensive woods
 until Victorian times when market     
 gardening,especially strawberry       
 production,expanded rapidily and      
 fortunes were made.Few 16th and 17th  
 century dwellings survive because many
 old cottages were pulled down and     
 replaced ay the turn of the century by
 rows of terraced  houses.These are now
 first homes but older people remember 
 families of up to 12 living in the 4  
 rooms.Fruit farming collapsed in the  
 1960's and few people work in the     
 village now.                          </content>
