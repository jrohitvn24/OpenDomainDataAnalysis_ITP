		<content> The AWRE (Atomic Weapons Research     
 Establishment) is the main employer in
 the area. Its work is classified, so  
 obviously we cannot describe, even if 
 we knew, what happens there. The      
 majority of the local population have 
 some form of contact with the AWRE,   
 perhaps because of this we were unable
 to find any opposition to nuclear     
 defence in the survey area, although  
 some people expressed fears at living 
 in such close proximity. This may     
 surprise those who associate the area 
 with CND marches and the "Greenham    
 Women", but the supporters of these   
 usually live far from this area.      
 Obviously there must be some opponents
 locally, perhaps among the young, but 
 they are far outnumbered by those who 
 actively support nuclear defence or   
 those to whom the AWRE and attendant  
 industries mean employment.           </content>
