 disused airfield which is now partly  
 used to house small workshops. Next

 is the Kent County Showground, in July

 main garages selling petrol and       
 carrying out car repairs.             
 Historic Buildings - one is a Motte

 narrow in some places. The main bus   
 route runs on the Sittingbourne A249  </content>
