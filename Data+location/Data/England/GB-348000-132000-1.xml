		<content>    This area, south east of Street is 
 dissected by a dominant ridge. To the 
 south of this there is a striking     
 slope. The main road runs from Ashcott
 to King Weston. The other principal   
 road runs from Street to Somerton     
 through Compton Dundon,recently this  
 has become more widely used by lorries
 as a link between the A303 and the M5 
 The other major settlement to the east
 is Butleigh. A large proportion of the
 hills and their dip slopes are covered
 in decidious woodland and, more       
 recently, conifer plantations. Dundon 
 Hill in the south west corner stands  
 out with its iron-age hill fort. The  
 most striking feature of the whole    
 area is the Hood monument overlooking 
 Compton Dundon. Both the undulating   
 land to the north of the ridge and the
 flat plains to the south are very     
 prosperous agriculturally.            </content>
