		<title>05THE SEA AT GURNARD.</title>
		<content> Off Princes Esplanade there is a      
 current mast in the sea. If you go    
 past the mast when you are swimming it
 could be dangerous .It is nice to swim
 there.in the summer there is a raft in
 the sea that you can  dive off.There  
 is a putting green and beach huts that
 people use.By the beach is a pub      
 called the Woodvale.Lots of people    
 bring there speed boats to Gurnard and
 they go water skiing in the bay.You   
 put long skis on and you hold a tow   
 rope attached to the boat.You have to 
 lie in the water and let the boat pull
 you up.The best time and place to go  
 fishing is just off Burnt Wood on a   
 rising tide.The best catch is cod     
 there are whole shoals of them.If you 
 want plaice you have to wait until    
 night when the tide comes in and the  
 plaice shoals come up.Occasionally you
 can catch the odd skate.              </content>
