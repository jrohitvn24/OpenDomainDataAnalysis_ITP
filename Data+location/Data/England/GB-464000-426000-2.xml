		<content> Two elderly residents of the village, 
 one for over forty years since coming 
 as a landgirl during World War Two,   
 the other for seventy years, both     
 enjoy the continuing peace of the     
 village but feel that improvements    
 such as better bus services, adequate 
 repairs to pavements and the opening  
 of a public house in Barlow would     
 enhance life considerably.            
 A younger couple who came to the      
 village two years ago because they    
 sought the peace associated with rural
 life nevertheless are finding it      
 difficult to adjust to fewer          
 facilities than they had been used to 
 in the town where they formerly lived.
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
