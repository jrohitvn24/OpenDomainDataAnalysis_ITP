		<content> Chain Tag was brought to Winsham      
 School by Martin Richards.There are   
 two people on it.They hold hands and  
 try to catch the others.When they     
 catch two people they hold hands and  
 they are on it as well.They go on     
 catching people until there are only  
 two people left.Then you start again  
 and they are on it.                   
                                       
 British Bulldog is an old game.There  
 are two people on it.They shout 1.2.3.
 British Bulldog and the others try to 
 run past them.When you catch someone  
 they have to say British Bulldog.     
                                       
 Poison is a game where two people are 
 on it and all the rest run.If you get 
 caught you open out your legs.When    
 someone goes under them you are free.
