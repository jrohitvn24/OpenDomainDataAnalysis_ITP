		<title>03FOUR MARKS : NOW</title>
		<content> Now:  These days, water is taken      
 through pipes to houses.  Lighting is 
 by electricity.  Cooking is done on   
 gas or electricity.  People don't keep
 animals to eat any more but keep      
 rabbits, cats and dogs for pleasure.  
 At present, there is no mains sewage  
 connection. Each house has its own    
 septic tank.                          
      Things are much larger these     
 days; Four Marks used to be a little  
 village, now it's turning into a small
 town.                                 
      Four Marks school is much larger.
  There are sixteen staff.  Children   
 don't stay at the school until 14 any 
 more, because the oldest is 11.       
 Transport is sometimes walking or     
 cycling but usually by car, train, bus
 or aeroplane.  Entertainment is nearly
 the same as it was then, except we    
 have television and video records.    </content>
