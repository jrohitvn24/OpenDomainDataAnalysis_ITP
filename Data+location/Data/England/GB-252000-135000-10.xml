		<title>10MARWOOD S. "OUR MILKMAN".</title>
		<content>    Mr. Steadman is our milkman  and   
 a big part of our community life. For 
 several old people he is perhaps their
 only daily link.He is also very kind  
 to animals and brought us a baby      
 hedgehog once as he thought we'd like 
 it and it would be safer in our garden
 than on the road.                     
    He lives on a farm at Whitehall and
 until about 5 years ago delivered all 
 his own TT farm milk. Now he delivers 
 all sorts of milk from Express        
 Dairies. He delivers about 400 pints a
 day to nearly 300 houses in all.(Some 
 he only visits every other day.) His  
 round is about 14 miles.              
    Mr. Steadman occassionally has a   
 boy to help him but apart from an     
 illness he has done the job 7 days a  
 week, getting up at 3am.,for 25 years.
    When it snows Mr. Steadman delivers
 the milk by tractor.                  </content>
