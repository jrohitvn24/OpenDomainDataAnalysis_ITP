		<title>04THE PARISH COUNCIL MORETON</title>
		<content> We went to interview the Chairman of  
 the{Parish Council.}He has been on the
 Council for nine years.There is an    
{election}every 4 years and people over
 18 can stand or vote.If you get voted 
 out of the Council you can try to get 
 back at the next election.The Parish  
 Council covers the Parish of Moreton. 
 There are nine people on the Council  
 and the Council are{responsible}for   
 the village greens,looking after the  
 trees in the main street(they are     
 building walls around them now)keeping
 the place clean and tidy,recreation,  
 allotments and cemeteries.You do not  
 get paid for being on the Council. It 
 is voluntary.The chairman of the      
 Parish Council is on the Council      
 because he likes helping people.Only  
 two people get paid ,a road sweeper   
 and a parish clerk.There is a meeting 
 every month,after six p.m. by law.    </content>
