		<content>There is one Post Office and one shop  
in the area. As trade is poor the      
local shop closes each day at 1.00p.m  
Groceries are dearer than in town, and 
for economic reasons shoppers only buy 
goods from the shop that are urgently  
needed. The bulk of their food is      
bought elsewhere.                      
The Post Office sells sweets and       
stationary, as well as paints, farm    
requisites,a limited ammount of        
wellingtons, shoes and tools.          
The Post Office runs a Taxi service,   
and also takes local handicapped       
children to and from school.           
There is also a garage  on the Post    
Office site, which offers a car and    
implement repair service. Petrol is    
also sold.
