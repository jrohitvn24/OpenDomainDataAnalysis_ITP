		<content> There are about 150 houses in this    
 block. Most are owner occupied though 
 a few tied cottages remain but these  
 are not always let to farm workers. Of
 the 10 council houses in Cratfield 1  
 is divided into 2 flats &amp; 3 are being 
 bought by their occupiers. There are a
 few second homes used only at weekends
 are for holidays. 2 houses are empty  
 but generally houses offered for sale 
 are bought quickly. Tiny attached     
 cottages have been made into one      
 dwelling and the Victorian school, 3  
 pubs and the Town house have been     
 turned into private houses. The houses
 date from the 16th century onwards.At 
 the moment in Cratfield and its two   
 hamlets, new houses can only be built 
 within strict limits . There is       
 planning permission for 4 houses and  
 the foundations of two of these are   
 being prepared.                       </content>
