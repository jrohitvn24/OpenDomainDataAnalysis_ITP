		<title>15NORTH COTSWOLD HUNT BROADWAY</title>
		<content> Every year a large crowd gathers      
 outside the{Swan Inn, Broadway}to     
 watch the traditional{Boxing Day}meet 
 of the{North Cotswold Hunt.}The hunt  
 kennels are situated in Kennel Lane,  
{Broadway}where the hounds are housed  
 and looked after by a full-time kennel
 man. At present the hunt is run by    
 a syndicate of four masters, who take 
 it in turns to oversee the running of 
 the kennels and lead the hunt, which  
 meets at various places during the    
 season. From the end of October until 
 the following March weather permitting
 they hunt on Monday, Wednesday and    
 Saturday. Saturday is the most popular
 day, sometimes with a field of two    
 hundred. Generally Saturday hunting is
 restricted to members, but visitors   
 are permitted to hunt from time to    
 time. The opening meet in October is  
 held in{Broadway}at the Swan Inn.     </content>
