 The housing in our square can best be 
 described as low density .every house 
 has a garden front and back ,even     
 flats have open gardens or grass .The 
 whole square is characterised by a    
 feeling of openess.It is a very       
 relaxed environment dominated by      
 trees.                                
   The housing stock,built between     
 1938/1955,is varied and comprises 725 
 terraced houses,262 semi-detached,50  
 detached,42 flats.The variety means   
 that people of all ages and families  
 of all different sizes live together  
 in the same community.                
    Many people are now buying their   
 own houses from the council and are   
 making improvements to them.          
 modernisation includes double-glazing,
 extensions,garages,porches and new    
 doors.                                </content>
