		<title>14TRAFFIC (1): WARLEY, ESSEX</title>
		<content>   A traffic survey was carried out on 
 all roads in the block in early May.  
 Between noon and 1 pm. c.{10,000      
 vehicles made a transit through the   
 area. Approximately 80% of the        
 north-south flows were handled by the 
{M25.}East-west flows were mostly      
 handled by one of the two{radial      
{routes}to{London, the A12 or A127.}The
{A12}accounted for 38% of the east     
 moving and 40% of the west moving     
 flows, the{A127}41% of the east moving
 and 40% of the west moving flows.     
 These amounts would vary during the   
 day.{Minor roads}handled considerable 
 flows, however: an average of one car 
 every twelve seconds was passing down 
 Nag's Head Lane (Brook Street to Up-  
 minster), one every ten seconds on the
 lane from Great Warley to Harold Wood,
 and{one every eight seconds}on the    
{B186.                                 </content>
