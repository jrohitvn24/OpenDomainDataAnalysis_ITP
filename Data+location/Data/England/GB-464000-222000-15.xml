 school,then I had cornflakes for      
 breakfast. Then I played with things  
 by myself. At 10 to 9 I went to school
 When I got there I talked to Jason and
 Gavin then we went into the           
 classroom.We went into assembly and   
 sang a hymn and talked about helping  
 each other,then we said a prayer. Then
 we went back to our classroom and did 
 our work. At 10.30 we went out to     
 play. After this we did written work. 
 At 12.00 we had lunch then half an    
 hour for playtime. At 1.00 we went in
