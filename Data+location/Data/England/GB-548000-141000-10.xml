		<content> The Police Force is a self governing  
 body paid for from the County Rate. We
 have no resident Police Officer but   
 are served by full time police at the 
 part time Police Station at Edenbridge
 6 miles away which, when not manned,  
 is connected by direct telephone to   
 Sevenoaks Police Station 11 miles     
 away. A Police car patrols the area   
 once every day &amp;, depending on duties,
 a second patrol is frequently made.   
 There is little crime in the area,    
 what there is comes under the folowing
 four headings, house burglary,        
 vandalism, sheep worrying by          
 uncontrolled dogs &amp; road traffic      
 accidents which are chiefly civil     
 offences but may come to the criminal 
 court.
