		<title>10CHURCHES WELBURY &amp; DEIGHTON</title>
		<content> Welbury church,St.Leonards,is built on
 the highest point of the              
 village.Though medieval in origin it  
 was heavily restored in 1887 by       
 Hicks.The building is used regularly  
 by a small congregation but most      
 villagers think it important to have a
 church. The incumbent,Mr.George       
 Davies, is also Rector of East &amp; West 
 Rounton.  A Congregational Chapel was 
 started in two cottages in 1843 but   
 this is now a private house. Apart    
 from the Church of England members of 
 all denominations travel elsewhere to 
 worship. A Sunday School is held in   
 the Village Hall for young children of
 the Parish.At Christmas the children  
 perform a Nativity play in the church 
 for the villagers. All Saints,Deighton
 is another medieval church restored by
 Hicks in 1901.It is now administered  
 with St.Thomas's in Brompton.         </content>
