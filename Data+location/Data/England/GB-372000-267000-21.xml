<content>



The Village Post Office has now been sold as a private house and the Post Office counter is now in the Village Shop, previously known as Flello's. The area behind this shop, which used to provide a route in from the main road and from the common, as well as a car park for the shop, has also been sold for housing development. &lt;br />&lt;br />The other shop which was in the middle of the village, next to the Manor Arms, has also been sold and reconverted to a private house.&lt;br />&lt;br />The Village School is flourishing and has a number of modern extensions.&lt;br />&lt;br />The Village Hall, which used to be next to the school, was demolished and the site developed for housing. A new village hall was built opposite the school and is used by the Playgroup (originally set up in 1983 - 4 in the old village hall) and numerous other village groups as well as providing a venue for parties and weddings.&lt;br />&lt;br />
