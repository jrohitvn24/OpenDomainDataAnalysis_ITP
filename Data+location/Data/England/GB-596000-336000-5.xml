		<content>  This is an almost no-existent        
 factor in village life.   With the    
 closure of the railway staion at      
 Thursford, the village was reduced to 
 one bus a week to Fakenham Market each
 Thursday.   This year the service has 
 been privatised and there is also an  
 Age Concern bus for the elderly each  
 Tuesday, and Wells Community bus to   
 Holt each Friday morning.             
  Secondary schoolchildren travel by   
 hired coach to Wells each day.        
 Most households need one and often two
 cars to take members of the family to 
 work.                                 
  A mobile library service travels     
 from Wells to the village once a      
 month.                                
  Private coaches are hired by various 
 groups to make summer excursions to   
 the seaside, or evening trips to the  
 theatre in Norwich.                   </content>
