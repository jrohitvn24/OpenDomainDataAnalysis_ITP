		<title>01LINTON AND ITS SURROUNDINGS</title>
		<content>   Linton,the focal point of this block
 is one of the largest villages in S.E 
 Cambridgeshire and one of the most    
 picturesque with many fine examples of
 timber and plaster dwellings.         
   Historically it has  Iron Age and   
 Roman remains,a fine Twelfth Century  
 church and a half-timbered Guildhall. 
  Being the largest village in the area
 Linton has schools,shops and medical  
 services which are also used by the   
 nearby smaller villages.These services
 offer some employment as do the local 
 farms and the light industries within 
 the village.However Linton's rapid    
 expansion during the past 15 years has
 resulted largely from its becoming a  
 dormitory village serving particularly
 the cities of Cambridge and London.   
   The arable farmland surrounding the 
 village is amongst the most productive
 in the country including a vineyard.  </content>
