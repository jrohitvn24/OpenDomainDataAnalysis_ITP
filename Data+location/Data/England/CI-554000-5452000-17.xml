		<title>17SAND DIGGING</title>
		<content> For many years the sand has been dug  
 at a number of pits in St Ouen's Bay. 
                                       
 One pit is just to the south of the   
 Conservation area called La Mielle    
 de Morville and is used to dig sand   
 for the building industry.            
                                       
 Because the sand was needed the States
 of Jersey zoned this area and another 
 one to the south for sand extraction. 
                                       
 When the extraction is finished the   
 pits will be restored as part of the  
 plan to conserve the area.            
                                       
 In the past the empty pits were used  
 as refuse tips and there were smells  
 and pollution which were difficult to 
 get rid of.                           
                                       
 In future much more care will be taken</content>
