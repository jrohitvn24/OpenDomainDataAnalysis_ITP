		<title>06THE MIGHTY SHIRES</title>
		<content>    My uncle Ted breeds shire          
 horses.He has got 27 altogether,5     
 males and 22 females.They cost between
 500 to 5000 pounds.He has got 8 foals 
 and the first one was born on the 8th 
 of April 1985.They each eat 7lbs of   
 oats and 10lbs of hay.Shire horses do 
 not mind sharing a field with any     
 other sorts of animals.The tallest    
 shire horse is Kathy, she is 18 hands 
 that is 76 inches which is about      
 two metres in height. Shire horses are
 not just black and white they can be  
 brown,beige,grey or white.My uncle Ted
 has often been kicked by them.        
    The shire horses only wear horse   
 shoes when they are working but they  
 do not pull carts any more.When the   
 foals are born they are registered and
 then they are given a name.
