		<title>08The Dairy</title>
		<content>   My dad works at the Dairy(Express   
 Dairies). I think he works hard       
 because one week he works 5pm-6am,    
 another week he works 6am-6pm. My     
 dad's job at the Dairy is a{foreman.  
 He helps people who are not getting on
 very well and he tells people what to 
 do and he does people's jobs when they
 are ill.                              
   The{milk}comes from different farms 
 in the area. They collect the milk by 
 driving a{lorry}to the{farms}and      
 pumping it into the back of the lorry 
 and then take it back to the Dairy.   
   They make the milk into lots of     
 things, such as -{cheese, yoghurt}and 
{butter.}They skim some milk and make  
 it into{longlife}milk.                
   The workers there each get twelve   
 cartons of milk a week.
