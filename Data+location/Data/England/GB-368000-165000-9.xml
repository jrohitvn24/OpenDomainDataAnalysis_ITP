		<title>09THE CYCLE TRACK WEST OF BATH</title>
		<content> The cycle track was once a working    
 railway line. In 1966 it was closed   
 down by British Rail. A group known as
{Cycle Bag}transformed the line into a 
 cycle track in 1979 for people to     
 cycle the five and a half miles to    
 Bitton. In 1985 it was extended to    
 Bristol. From the cycle track you can 
 see the Caravan Park, the Boating     
 Station and nearby farmland.          
 Quite a lot of plants grow along the  
 cycle track. Some of the common plants
 are bugle, buttercups, vetch, red     
 campion, ladies' lace, dandelions,    
 plantain, black meddic, goosegrass,   
 thistle and herb Robert. There are    
 also forget-me-nots, ox-eye daises,   
 speedwell, woody nightshade and wild  
 strawberries.                         
 Trees have been planted along the     
 track but most of them are still      
 young.                                </content>
