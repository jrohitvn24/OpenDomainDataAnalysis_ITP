		<title>14THE HARWICH MARKET</title>
		<content>    THE HARWICH MARKET IS HELD EVERY   
 FRIDAY. THE MOST COMMON FOODS BOUGHT  
 ARE VEGETABLES, MEAT, CAKES, EGGS AND 
 FRUIT.                                
    MOST OF THE PEOPLE USUALLY WALK TO 
 THE MARKET EVERY WEEK BECAUSE EITHER  
 THE FOOD IS CHEAPER OR IT IS FRESHER. 
    THE MAIN GOODS SOLD ON THE MARKET  
 AT DOVERCOURT ARE HARDWARE, WATCHES,  
 PASTRY, CHEESE,WOOL, MOTOR EQUIPMENT, 
 LINEN, HOME BREW EQUIPMENT AND FRUIT  
 AND VEGETABLES.                       
    SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT THERE SHOULD
 BE A FEW MORE STALLS, ESPECIALLY A TOY
 STALL. ONE PERSON EVEN WANTED A STALL 
 WHERE YOU COULD BID FOR THE ITEMS!    
    SOME TRADERS SAY THAT THE RENT IS  
 TOO HIGH AND NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE COME TO
 THE MARKET. THEY ALSO FEAR THAT THE   
 NEW COOP SUPERMARKET BEING BUILT      
 OPPOSITE WILL TAKE TRADE AWAY FROM    
 THEM; MOST SHOPPERS ARE IN FAVOUR.    </content>
