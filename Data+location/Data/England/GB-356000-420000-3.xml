   The future of 300-year-old Buckshaw 
 Hall was said to be in the balance    
 after a special meeting in the Town   
 Hall. It was decided that the historic
 building should be removed from the   
 ROF grounds but that its upkeep must  
 not become a burden on ratepayers.    
   One possibility was to sell the hall
 to a private developer who would run  
 it as a restaurant.                   
   Euxton parish councillors are       
 anxious to see the hall kept in public
 ownership and open to visitors.       
   The Central Lancashire Development  
 Corporation have rejected Euxton Park 
 as a new site but although councillors
 are looking at other possibilities it 
 is still hoped this will be the final 
 home of the 17th century house.
