		<title>17"The changing landscape "</title>
		<content> Since the late 1960's the most        
 significant change in the local       
 landscape has been the gradual        
 encroachment on the Wreake valley and 
 the areas surrounding East Goscote and
 Cossington, of the sand and gravel    
 excavations.The first pit to be dug in
 the area,immediately adjacent to the  
 Cossington Mill and south of the      
 B5328,was allowed to fill with water  
 after the initial exavation and has   
 now become a thriving nature reserve  
 and well-stocked fishing lake.        
 It was decided,however,back           
 in January 1979, that enough was      
 enough and that no more pits or large 
 artificial lakes were wanted and to   
 this end 'The Cossington' Residents'  
 Action Committee' was formed.It waged 
 a vigorous campaign for over three    
 years to preserve this delightful     
 rural spot.By Mrs A Smith             </content>
