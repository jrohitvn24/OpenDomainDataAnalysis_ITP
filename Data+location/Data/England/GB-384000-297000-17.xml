MY MUM...well my Mum used to knit but  
she gave it up because she said it was 
an awful bore. She always likes to see 
people occupied, not just sitting there
doing nothing. She likes listening to  
music played on the Radio or on her    
Cassette Player. She also likes to     
watch television-she enjoys watching   
soap operas. She reads and smokes. I   
would like her to give that up.        
                                       
MY DAD...well my Dad likes to make his 
own Beer and Wine. He is very good at  
making Beer and Wines(Carrot Wine and  
Elderberry Wine). He too like to watch 
some soap operas on television and read
Library Books. He is good at cooking   
and he wants me to be a Chef when I    
grow up.
