		<content> Rochester Farm handles 7000 turkeys a 
 year of a breed called Sun Valley Two.
 The farm covers 82 acres,2 for the    
 turkeys.They are fed until fat enough 
 to be slaughtered by electric shock.  
 They are then hung and then           
 plucked.The average weight of a turkey
 is 15 lbs but they vary between 7-45  
 lbs.                                  
 The owner sells most of them at his   
 shop in Great Leighs.If his stock is  
 damaged in any way he sells them as   
 turkey burgers or cutlets.            
 They sell on average about 20 turkeys 
 a week,but at Christmas time he sells 
 between 6000-7000,since eating a      
 turkey at christmas is customary.
