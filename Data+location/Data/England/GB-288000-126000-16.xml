		<title>16Tourists in Dulverton</title>
		<content>      The pleasant countryside around  
 Dulverton attracts many visitors,over 
 1 millon each year.Tourists are the   
 major income of many shops,hotels and 
 caravan sites in the little town and  
 provide lots of jobs for local people.
      Parking is a problem in the      
 narrow streets of Dulverton especially
 when there are coach loads of people  
 milling about the town.The National   
 Park is trying to preserve and enhance
 the natural beauty of the area.Also   
 they are trying to promote its        
 enjoyment for the public.             
      One other problem with visitors  
 is litter.They eat their picnic lunch 
 and throw litter down any where.      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
