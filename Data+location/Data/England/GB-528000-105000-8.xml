		<title>08The Royal Pavilion</title>
		<content> In 1750 Dr Russell published a book in
 which he announced a startling new    
 discovery: dipping the body in salt   
 water helped cure certain diseases. So
 a mad rush to the seabegan and the    
 Prince of Wales, Prince Regent, joined
 the rush and came to Brighton. In 1785
 he decided he wanted a little, simple 
 cottage with his wife. But his life   
 became less and less simple and he    
 decided to have an architect add on   
 buildings to his cottage. The         
 architect, john Nash , liked the      
 orient, so he put a mixture of        
 Chinese, Japanese and Indian buildings
 were built. When Queen Victoria saw   
 the pavilion, she was disappointed in 
 it. But Brighton bought and preserved 
 it. Now the building has been restored
 fully with the Oriental and Asian     
 style.See it to believe it.
