		<title>19A Solihull Parish Priest (2)</title>
		<content> The Parish Priest has a team of       
 parishioners who help him with his    
 fund raising. He has also written nine
 books on the subjects of human rights,
 peace and the Third World. Some of the
 money he has raised has been sent to  
{Amnesty International,}an organisation
 which helps prisoners of conscience.  
{Our Lady of the Wayside}church was    
 built in 1967. An Interesting feature 
 is the bronze statue of the risen     
 Christ which rises above the main     
 altar. It was designed and sculpted by
{Dame Elizabeth Frank}who charged only 
 the cost of the materials. It is now  
 valued at many thousands of pounds.   
 The other church in our area is a new 
{Ecumenical church}in the Hillfield    
 Monkspath area which began services on
 March 3rd. 1985. The Methodist        
 services here are taken by the{Rev.   
{Dorothy Lloyd.                        </content>
