		<content>    Upham is a small village set among 
 the chalk downlands of Hampshire.     
    This area is very rural, being     
 mostly woods and farmlands, with few  
 houses. In fact the Tithe Map of 1838 
 looks very much the same as Upham does
 now in 1985. The present main road was
 new in those days, but most of the    
 cottages and farms which are along it 
 now were just the same then.          
    The land has been farmed since     
 Roman times and there are in fact the 
 remains of a Roman Road and villa in  
 the district.                         
     Some of the families living here  
 have been in the area for generations,
 but there is also a strong contingent 
 of people who live in the village and 
 work in nearby towns and cities. The  
 population at present numbers 247.
