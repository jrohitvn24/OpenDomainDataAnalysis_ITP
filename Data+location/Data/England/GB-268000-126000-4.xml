 people go to Church. I go to my Grans.
 We go and  paddle in the river if it  
 is hot. And if it is cold we play     
 indoors.                              
 MONDAY-On weekdays we go to school. I 
 leave for school at 8.30am and I get  
 to school at 8.50am. I usually walk to
 school but sometimes I come in the    
 car. Some people come to school on the
 bus.                                  
 TUESDAY-On Tuesday we go swimming with
 the class. In the summer we go  to the
 South Molton swimming pool. In the    
 winter we go to Barnstaple swimming   
 pool which is indoors. We went for a  
 walk and in the evening at home we    
 made sweets for our Summer Fair.      
 WEDNESDAY-We are getting ready for the
 school Summer Fair. It starts at 7.00 
 pm tonight. I hope it is fun. I am
