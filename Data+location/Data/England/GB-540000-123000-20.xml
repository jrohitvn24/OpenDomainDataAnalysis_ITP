		<title>20SHEFFIELD PARK GARDEN</title>
		<content> In 1264 Simon de Montfort held the    
 manor of Sifelle ( Sheffield ) After  
 his death at Evesham in 1265 Henry 3  
 gave it to William Bardolph a loyal   
 royalist. The succeeding 500 years saw
 various tenants and owners. In 1769   
 John Baker Holroyd, later first Earl  
 of Sheffield, bought it and is        
 remembered as close friend of Edward  
 Gibbon (son of The Decline and Fall of
 the Roman Empire was written here).   
 Capability Brown laid out the gardens 
 for John Holroyd. They now cover about
 100 acres set around 5 lakes and      
 contain a very fine collection of     
 trees and flowering shrubs-autumn     
 colours are splendid. The National    
 Trust now own the gardens which are   
 open most days April to mid-November. 
 House only by special arrangement.
