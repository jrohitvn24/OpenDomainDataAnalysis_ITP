		<title>01THE ARLEY AND ASTLEY AREA</title>
		<content> The area, on the northern side of     
 Nuneaton in Warwickshire, lies only 20
 miles from the industrial region of   
 Birmingham  but is linked much more   
 closely with Coventry. It consists    
 mainly of open country/farmland and a 
 few patches of woodland, the main     
 areas of population being the villages
 of Arley and Astley. These have their 
 roots back to the original Domesday   
 survey but the coal industry at the   
 beginning of this century has done    
 most to shape the nature and culture  
 of the people. Nevertheless farms and 
 farming occupy much of the land cover 
 and activity and a deep cultural      
 heritage is evident in the number of  
 historical buildings and places of    
 interest.
