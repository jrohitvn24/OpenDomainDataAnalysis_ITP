 My typical school day starts when I   
 get up and get changed into my school 
 clothes.When I am dressed I go and    
 have a wash.After washing I to        
 downstairs and have my breakfast which
 consists of cornflakes and            
 coffee.After I have eaten my breakfast
 I make my packed lunch.               
     I live about two miles away from  
 the school and it takes me 45 minutes 
 to get there.School starts at 9.00am  
 and finishes at 3.30pm and we have one
 and a half hours at lunch break.      
     During the evening I usually go   
 digging for old bottles  in the creek.
 (They used the creeks to dump         
 rubbish).Sometimes I stay in and play 
 games on my computer.                 
     At about 9.00pm I get my supper   
 then about 10.00pm I go to bed.
