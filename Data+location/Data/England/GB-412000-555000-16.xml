		<title>16THE INKWORKS - LINTZFORD</title>
		<content>    The world famed Richardson Printing
 Ink Co. Ltd. has been in Lintzford    
 since the late 18th century. It was   
 previously a corn mill then a paper   
 mill. It is situated in the heart of  
 the Derwent Valley about 7 miles from 
 Newcastle and about 2 miles north west
 of Rowlands Gill, on the Consett road.
    To enter the works, one must drive 
 carefully over a small humped back    
 bridge then over ancient cobble stones
 that were probably laid when the works
 was still a paper mill. The Derwent   
 River was, and still is, used by the  
 works, but for different reasons. It  
 was used to turn the mill and now it  
 is used to cool the machines.         
 Approximately 50 people work at the   
 Inkworks. They work an 8 hour day,    
 five days a week, with overtime..
