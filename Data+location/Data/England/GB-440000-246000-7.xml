 property was built during the late    
 1960's,by voluntary labour and local  
 fundraising.It is run and maintained  
 by a voluntary Executive Committee    
 made up of members from all the using 
 groups and depends on the Schools     
 usage by Education funding and local  
 groups.                               
 The North Banbury Scout Group,a major 
 user of the Hall with a membership of 
 85 in the four training sections      
 (Beavers,Cubs,Scouts and Venture      
 Scouts),decided in 1984 to build an   
 Equipment DEN at the side of the      
 Hall.This would house all their       
 training equipment and enhance        
 the Groups working facilities.The     
 Â£4000 was raised by donation,job      
 activity and Council Grants with the  
 DEN being completed and handed over to
 the TRUST on 2nd November 1985.       </content>
