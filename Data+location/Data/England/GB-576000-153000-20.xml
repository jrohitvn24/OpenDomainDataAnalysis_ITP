		<title>20STONEACRE, OTHAM</title>
		<content>   Stoneacre is a small half-timbered  
 manor house built by John Ellys in the
 1480s in Otham parish at 799535. It   
 has been much altered since then and  
 many additions,especially a north-west
 wing, were made by its American owner,
 Aymer Vallance, before he presented it
 to the National Trust in 1928. He also
 added panelling, furniture, and       
 paintings considered appropriate to   
 his restoration of the timber framing.
  The property is still occupied by    
 private tenants, but the house and    
 gardens are now open to the public, at
 a charge of Â£1 per head, on Wednesday 
 and Saturday afternoons from April to 
 September inclusive.
