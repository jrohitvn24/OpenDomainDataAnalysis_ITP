		<title>12DAY OF A CHILD AGE 9 ALSAGER</title>
		<content> Monday July 8th started like any other
 day, I get out of bed, go to the      
 bathroom ,have a drink, then go down  
 stairs. "Hello," says Mum, "hurry up  
 with breakfast." Mum's always up      
 before me,her hobby is knitting. David
 comes down with Dad; my Dad's hobby   
 is messing with the car. David likes  
 snooker. The cat rubs round my legs,  
 his hobby seems to be bird catching.  
 I set off for school. I play out as   
 soon as I get there. The whistle      
 goes at 9.00 a.m.  Oh no its maths.   
 The type of sums we do are like this: 
  Â£7.54 or  15 or 65/7 or 698          
 +Â£5.26    x14           _284          
 ______    ___           ____          
 English is better than maths. We go   
 and play at 10.30 a.m. Eat at noon    
  and play at 2.30p.m. My hobbies are  
 collecting ornaments and playing      
 tennis. By Sarah White.               </content>
