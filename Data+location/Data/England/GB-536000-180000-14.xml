		<title>14St.Andrew's Hospital</title>
		<content>Once a thriving district general       
hospital with around 900 beds.It is in 
Tower Hamlets,but it is now run by     
Newham Health Authority.In the last 5  
years 295 beds have gone,leaving a 650 
bed hospital with no children's,       
maternity or female surgical beds.A    
further cut back was the closure of    
accident and emergency in 1984-and now 
the complete closure is planned for    
1994.St.Andrew's has served both Tower 
Hamlets and Newham people.Half the     
casualty users were from Tower Hamlets.
With closure of casualty,fewer people  
from Tower Hamlets have access to St.  
Andrew's.Hospital beds will be occupied
increasingly by elderly people only.The
hospital will gradually be run down,   
which undermines both staff morale and 
patient care.
