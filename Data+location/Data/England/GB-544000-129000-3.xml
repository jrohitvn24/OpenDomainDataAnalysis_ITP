		<content> Scientific Interest and to promote a  
 caring attitude and interest in wild- 
 life through education. Access to the 
 Nature Reserve is restricted to marked
 paths. Rarities in every category of  
 wild-life are recorded but their habi-
 tats are never divulged. There are    
 firebreaks on both the forest and the 
 Nature Reserve and recovery after the 
 1984 fires is being monitored monthly 
 in the Reserve by a local school. Wood
 cut here is often piled up to create a
 habitat site, rather than being       
 burned. Certain birds and butterflies,
 now rare in the Forest are being bred 
 locally and reinstated. Guided natural
 history walks are organised by the    
 Forest Rangers. Participants pay a    
 small fee.
