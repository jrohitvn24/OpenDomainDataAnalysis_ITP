		<title>04ATTITUDES OF BRANSTON PEOPLE</title>
		<content> Branston used to be a small village   
 but now more housing estates have been
 erected and there are over 700 more   
 people than there used to be 10 years 
 ago. Some people have lived here all  
 their lives. The rest moved here      
 because of jobs.                      
     People felt very strongly about   
 the size of our village and that it   
 should be developed no further.       
 Several said there was enough         
 recreation for adults but not enough  
 for children. Branston seems a good   
 retirement area. The people who knew  
 anything about Branston schools said  
 they were O.K. (See education).       
     The aircraft noise from Waddington
 is very unpopular, but long term      
 residents are used to it. Most people 
 said they liked Branston. They thought
 it was a good village to live in.
