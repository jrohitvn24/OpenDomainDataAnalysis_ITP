		<title>05Area around Bristol airport</title>
		<content> Bristol airport is on the A38,some of 
 it extending into our area,but most of
 it lying just to the north.           
   There are very few houses to the    
 east and south of the airport because 
 of aircraft noise.Most farms and some 
 houses were built before the airport, 
 but very few have been built since.   
    There is some concern that the     
 airport runway may be extended east   
 across the A38,which would then have  
 to be diverted underground.This would 
 involve the loss of Felton common with
 its sports and recreation facilities. 
 There would also be an increase in    
 noise and road traffic from the       
 increased number of flights.
