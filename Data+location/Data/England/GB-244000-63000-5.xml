		<title>05BERE FERRERS RAILWAY LINK</title>
		<content>    Bere Ferrers is on the Plymouth -  
 Gunnislake line.Fourteen trains a day 
 stop at Bere Ferrers, linking it with 
 towns near the peninsula.  It is a    
 single track railway.  The station at 
 Bere Ferrers is unmanned and has been 
 sold to be converted to holiday flats.
 At one time the railway company had   
 two holiday coaches in the station    
 yard.  By the station is a very large 
 old shed and a raised platform.In past
 years, fruit growers from the area    
 would load their fruit onto trucks    
 from the raised platform.  This would 
 then be taken by train to catch the   
 early Covent Garden market.  Nowadays 
 it is impossible to send unaccompanied
 goods on the line and passenger space 
 is limited on the new coaches.  Bere  
 Ferrers needs its railway link and    
 either closure or conversion to a     
 motorway would be untenable .         </content>
