		<title>18THE VILLAGE HALL.</title>
		<content>  In the centre of the village stands a
 large, impressive red brick building. 
 Built in 1780,it is a good example of 
 a Georgian town house. Today, it is   
 the hub of village life.              
  Extensive alterations were made on   
 the ground floor, a large lounge and  
 bar were added and in 1973 it was open
 to the villagers to hire for private  
 functions. In 1979 further            
 improvements were added.              
  Now,THE RED HOUSE,is a very busy     
 place indeed.Bookings have to be made 
 many months in advance as the halls   
 are in great demand, providing a      
 meeting place for all the local       
 societies, a central venue for coffee 
 mornings and pleasant surroundings for
 parties,wedding receptions,and dances.
 The Registrar holds weekly clinics    
 here and the Parish Council, there    
 monthly meetings.                     </content>
