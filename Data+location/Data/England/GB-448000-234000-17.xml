    The old streets were named because 
 of what was in them: Church Lane by   
 the Parish Church, Mill Lane, Bulls   
 Lane and Wales Street; wales being an 
 old word for wells.  These roads are  
 narrow and bendy.   In the Council    
 Housing area we can guess what the    
 houses replaced:  The Willows, Dairy  
 Ground and Orchard Way.               
    In the newest private housing      
 estate the streets are named after    
 palaces and castles: Windsor Close,   
 Sandringham Road, Blenheim Rise,      
 Balmoral Way, Hampton Drive etc.      
 Perhaps the people selling the houses 
 thought grand names made the houses   
 seem bigger and the area a nicer      
 place to live!                        
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
