 houses in the area the Dixes' abode,

 building.  Olive and Arthur, are not  
 allowed to replace the thatch with    
 tiles because of this and re-thatching
 such a house would cost in excess of  
 Â£5,000.

 a new life, and having cleared a patch
 in the forest built a hall and a      
 church on which the present Ugley Hall
 and St Peters Church stand.
