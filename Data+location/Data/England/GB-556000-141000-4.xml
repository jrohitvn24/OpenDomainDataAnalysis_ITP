		<content> The population of this area is growing
-about a 10% increase between 1961 and 
1981. Many of the people (33%) who are 
moving into the area are young (15-29).
Our survey showed that people buying   
their first home had difficulty in     
afforing houses. Many start by buying  
or renting flats. Because new housing  
is not a priority, no rapid growth is  
planned by the council. One major      
problem that worried people was the    
shortage of rented accomodation. The   
sale of council houses, cut-backs in   
building and the Green Belt policy have
stopped any expansion.                 
 It is estimated that about 10% of the 
working population commutes to London. 
Several parts of the area are dominated
by large impressive commuter suburbs.  
The village of Bidborough is made up of
large detached houses some of which    
cost well over #100,000.               </content>
