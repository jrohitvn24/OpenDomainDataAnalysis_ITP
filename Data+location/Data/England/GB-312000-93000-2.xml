		<content>   The{porous}Greensand plateau is deep
 -ly disected by the{Sid and Roncombe  
 Stream. The soft, easily eroded, Marls
 form the steep valley sides which were
 once densely wooded. On the western   
 side of{East Hill}a straight{Scarp    
 runs unbroken for five miles from     
 Beacon Hill to Westgate Hill. Below   
 this scarp lies a{spring line}which   
 has attracted settlement such as Ware 
 Farm (125958). The waterless plateau  
 top of East Hill has been avoided by  
 settlement however.                   
   The other side of East Hill is very 
 different. Deep valleys or{coombes}run
 into the main Sid valley. The streams 
 that rise here are more powerful and  
 their valleys provide shelter and an  
 assured water supply. Hence the number
 of farms which have the element"combe"
 in their name. The narrower Roncombe  
 valley is similar to the Sid Valley.  </content>
