		<title>08Cornwood bus services</title>
		<content> Local villages have set up a committee
 to look at the possibilities of a     
 community bus to take people to       
 Ivybridge and the Tesco superstore at 
 Lee Mill. Cornwood has 2 bus services 
 (of 4 buses each) travelling via      
 Plympton to Plymouth, 10 miles away.  
 Ivybridge(3 miles away) provides a    
 library; health-centre; chemist and   
 shops, but residents without a car    
 cannot reach these facilities.        
 A community bus would provide a useful
 service to these people.However,some  
 people believe that the bus will close
 down the two village shops,one of     
 which,incorporates a sub-post office. 
 Many pensions and child allowances are
 collected from this post office,      
 giving people a chance to get out and 
 meet friends and neighbours. Final    
 decisions have still to be made.
