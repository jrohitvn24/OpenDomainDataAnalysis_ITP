		<title>11Public Services in Bramdean</title>
		<content> There is a bus service connecting the 
 village with nearby towns, which runs 
 5 times per day with no service after 
 5.30pm or on Sunday.  There is one    
 mail delivery per day (except         
 Sundays), with collections twice per  
 day; and a public telephone box.  A   
 daily  milk and newspaper delivery is 
 available, but some houses collect    
 newspapers from a communal collecting 
 point.  A foot clinic visits once  a  
 month.  The nearest doctor's surgery  
 is 4 miles; the nearest ambulance 10  
 miles and the nearest fire station 4  
 miles.  A police constable lives with 
 his family in the village, in a small 
 sub-police station.  Telephones, mains
 water and electricity are available to
 all homes, but there is no mains gas. 
 There is no mains drainage in the     
 area, each house has its own septic   
 tank or cess pit.                     </content>
