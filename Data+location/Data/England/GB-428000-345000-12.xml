		<title>12Turnditch + Windley Stores</title>
		<content>     Mrs. J Wilson has been running the
 Turnditch  and  Windley  Stores for 18
 years now.  She had  alsways wanted to
 run a shop.  Previously, it had been a
 butcher's shop.  The shop is open from
 9.00a.m.  until  5.30p.m., the busiest
 day  being  Friday  and  the  quietest
 Tuesday.  There have been changes over
 the years:  she does not sell paraffin
 or fireworks  now.                    
    When we visited the shop in July,we
 found the cost of some items  and also
 from where they came.
