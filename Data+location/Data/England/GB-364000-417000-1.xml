		<content> All the land in this block falls      
 within the West Pennine Moors         
 Recreational Area.  It is owned by the
 North West Water Authority, and most  
 is leased to two tenant farmers, with 
 the A675 Bolton to Preston road       
 dividing the two farms.  This is a    
 water catchment area feeding Belmont  
 Reservoir, which flows out into Eagley
 Brook whose water is used to dilute   
 effluent further downstream.  It is   
 largely enclosed rough grazing land,  
 mainly used for sheep and cattle.     
 Geologically it is sandstone laid down
 in the Carboniferous era, with a thick
 carpet of peat.  It is popular with   
 walkers and ramblers as there are     
 several public footpaths across the   
 moors.  Varied bird life and small    
 mammals are all found here.  Only     
 three inhabited dwellings survive from
 about eight some 50 years ago.        </content>
