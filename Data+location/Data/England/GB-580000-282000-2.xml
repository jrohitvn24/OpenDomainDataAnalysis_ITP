		<title>02THETFORD WARREN LODGE</title>
		<content> Unfortunately this building was badly 
 damaged by fire in 1935 but has been  
 restored. It is thought to have been  
 built in the 14C or 15C as the        
 dwelling and headquarters of the      
 keeper of the Warren, which was estab-
 lished in Norman times.Similar archi- 
 tecture to this square building can be
 found at Mildenhall Warren, Suffolk.  
 It is maintained as shown in the photo
 graphs by the English Heritage in a   
 clearing in the Thetford Forest.      
 The car park for visiting this site is
 situated on a stretch of land conser- 
 ved as Breckland was until afforest-  
 ation.The rabbit population kept the  
 land cropped and bare to the sandy    
 soil also as shown.
