		<title>13REDDISH ROLLER DISCO</title>
		<content> At the{Roller Disco}you pay a pound to
 get in. if you want to get to the ring
 you go into a big hall down stairs.   
 You usually stay in for one and a half
 hours. As you skate around there is   
 music playing. There are always lots  
 of people there in their{roller boots 
 and you can hardly move. Some people  
 get in a bad mood bacause everyone    
 pushes and never say sorry. I  really 
 enjoy going to the{roller disco       
 because you get out for the night     
 instead of being bored at home. When  
 it is over, you can bring fifty pence 
 for a drink and a packet of crisps.   
 Then everyone goes home.              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
