		<content> Our class looked at leisure activities
 outside school. We found that the most
 popular activity was swimming         
 especially with younger children. This
 was followed by Tuesday club and then 
 the Brownies and Guides. Not so many  
 boys belong to cubs and scouts.Quite a
 few children are learning to play an  
 instrument or are having dancing      
 lessons. The piano was the most       
 popular instrument and ballet the most
 popular dance. Six children in our    
 school are having horse riding lessons
 and three boxing lessons.
