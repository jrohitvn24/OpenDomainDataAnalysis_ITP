		<title>01GAZETTE OF SLOUGH</title>
		<content>     This grid contains a large part of
 Slough's housing, concentrated in the 
 NE of the town.  Much of it, built in 
 the 1930's, is closely packed housing 
 separated by large parks &amp; open space.
 Slough is full to bursting - the      
 buildings  go right up to the borough 
 (&amp; County) boundaries.                
     Northwards the existing farmland &amp;
 landuse is preserved by the Green     
 Belt.  Farming is typical of the urban
 fringe with "horseyculture" common.   
 Much land is for private recreation   
 such as the Golf Club at Stoke Park   
 and the Club at Stoke Place. This area
 has the few remaining historic        
 buildings such as Stoke Poges Church &amp;
 the country houses, now used for      
 businesses or for recreation.         
     Facilities such as the large      
 hospital, crematorium &amp; cattle market 
 are found right at this edge of town. </content>
