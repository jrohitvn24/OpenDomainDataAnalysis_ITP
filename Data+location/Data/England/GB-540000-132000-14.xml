		<content>{The Seasons}is a health food shop in  
 the village of Forest Row.It has a    
 strong {Anthroposophical}bias in that 
 most of the produce is grown locally  
 by farmers who are sympathic to the   
 aims of the anthroposophical movement.
 All the {vegetables}are grown {       
{biodynamically}which means that the   
 use of chemical fertilizers and modern
 pesticides is strongly discouraged.   
 Milk and dairy products are sold fresh
 from{Plaw Hatch Farm}where even the   
 cows are treated with alternative     
 medicines.The success of this shop is 
 obvious as it has expanded rapidly    
 over recent years.It now sells {wooden
{toys,}Anthroposophical books and      
 stationery from recycled paper. All   
 the bread and confectionery is from   
 the local bakery who only uses the    
 flour from wheat that has been grown  
 biodynamically.                       </content>
