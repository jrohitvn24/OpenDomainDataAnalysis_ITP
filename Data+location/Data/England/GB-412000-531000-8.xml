		<content>   There is a game that lots of us play
 called Werewolf.The only trouble is   
 that we only play it in the{dark.     
   You play it like this:first you{pick
 to see who is on(it depends how many  
 are playing).If there are{seven}      
 playing there are two on and{five     
 off.The on people count to{four       
{hundred fast}and the off people go and
 hide.When the on people have{counted  
 they{look}for the off people.When they
 have{found}the off people,the off     
 people try to get away.The on people  
 have to{catch}as many off people as   
 they can.The{only}way to set the off  
 people free is to tig them off.At the 
 end of the game{the first two people  
 who were caught are on.
