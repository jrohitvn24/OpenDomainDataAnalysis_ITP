		<content> Horningsham Cricket Club was founded  
 in 1977 after the levelling of the    
 field behind the Village Hall.        
 It is run by a President, fourteen    
 Vice-Presidents, an Honorary Life     
 Member, a Chairman, a Membership      
 Secretary, a Fixture Secretary, a     
 Treasurer and a Scorer.               
 There are about thirty-eight matches  
 each season mainly against the teams  
 of the surrounding villages.          
 The team consists of a Captain,       
 Vice-Captain and nine players.        
                                       
                                       
 At 5p.m. during each match play stops 
 for tea which is provided by the      
 players and members' wives.
