		<title>03THE VICAR OF GILLING WEST</title>
		<content> The vicar of{Gilling}also looks after 
 the parishes of{Kirby Ravensworth}and 
{Melsonby.}                            
 He does not just take  services  in   
 church, but comforts families who have
 lost loved ones and prays for them. He
 visits the  sick and  elderly both at 
 home and in  hospital. He also meets  
 with  other  clergy  and  prepares    
 services.There are two main services  
 each Sunday,{Holy  Commumion }and     
{Evensong. Family Service}takes place  
 once a month and replaces Communion.  
 In a Family service we sing a song and
 say a prayer. The vicar then tells a  
 Bible story and shows pictures.  He   
 talks about{Jesus}and reads from the  
{Bible.}We then say a prayer and sing  
 another song.  One of the  children   
 takes the collection and the service  
 closes with the  vicar  saying  the   
{Benediction.}                         </content>
