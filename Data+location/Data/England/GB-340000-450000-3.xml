		<title>03Cockerham Saltmarsh Sea Wall</title>
		<content> A new sea wall was built in 1982 as   
 protection, after serious flooding in 
 the 1970's.The worst flood was on 11th
 November 1977 when 2800 hectares were 
 flooded and a smaller sea wall built  
 by local farmers was destroyed.The new
 wall runs from the River Cocker to    
 Fluke Hall at Pilling and the main    
 bank is 7500 metres long.It is 7.6    
 metres high above ordnance datum and  
 cost Â£1.6 million.This was paid for by
 the Water Authority,the Ministry of   
 Agriculture and local farmers.It      
 enclosed some 270 hectares about half 
 of this in the Cockerham Parish.      
 Wildlife conservation  was considered 
 by building ponds for wildfowl and    
 area's were left for the Natterjack   
 Toad.After consruction local farmers  
 were able to drain and reclaim the    
 land protected by the wall,allowing   
 major improvements in productivity.   </content>
