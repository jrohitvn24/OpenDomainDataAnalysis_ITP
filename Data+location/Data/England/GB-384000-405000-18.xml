		<title>18MIDDLETON CIVIC ASSOCIATION</title>
		<content>   Middleton Civic Association was     
 founded in 1974 on the reorganisation 
 of local government to "promote,      
 stimulate and continue the social life
 of the Town of Middleton". The local  
 press commented "Without such a body  
 Middleton can so easily descend into a
 mere parochial limb of the massive    
 200,000 population body centred on the
 former Rochdale Borough.              
  The association has loyally carried  
 out these functions and arranged      
 annual events to maintain traditions  
 of the community. It is particularly  
 concerned to celebrate the centenary  
 town's incorporation as a borough, in 
 1986. The Association has become a    
 source of advice and support on       
 several issues, such as pedestrian-   
 isation of the town centre, the       
 listing and conservation of important 
  local buildings.                     </content>
