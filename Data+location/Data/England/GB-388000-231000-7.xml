		<title>07TOWN MAYORS</title>
		<content>  Tewkesbury has been classed as a'Gem 
 Town',one of only 51 in the           
 country,but despite this the children 
 asked the mayor if there were any     
 things he did not like about          
 Tewkesbury.The mayor felt the new     
 shopping precinct was out of character
 and that it would be an improvement if
 the amount of traffic travelling      
 through the town could be lessened.It 
 was stated that Tewkesbury would      
 retain its character as the majority  
 of its buildings were listed.         
                                       
  The present mayor sees his position  
 as a great honour.He enjoys his work  
 and does not regret in any way being  
 elected.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
