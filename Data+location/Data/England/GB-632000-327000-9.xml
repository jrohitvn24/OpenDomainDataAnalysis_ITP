		<content> Most homes are brick built. In the    
 villages are semi-detached council    
 houses,a few terraced rows of small   
 houses,and larger detached homes, some
 converted from former shops or public 
 houses, and privately owned.In the    
 surrounding countryside are some large
 farmhouses,a mansion and three        
 rectories no longer inhabited by      
 clergy.Many of the houses are         
 connected with farming.Flint is a     
 local building material, used either  
 as whole stones,knapped into square   
 shapes or cut so as to present a flat,
 shining surface called dressing. There
 are many cottages made of flint or    
 flint and brick. These were often     
 'tied' cottages that went with a      
 farmworker's job. If he lost his job  
 he also lost his home. The law does   
 not allow this to happen now.
