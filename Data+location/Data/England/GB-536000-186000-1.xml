		<title>01WALTHAMSTOW MARKET</title>
		<content> 1{Walthamstow Market is the longest   
{market in Europe.}It is a mile long.  
 The market is open on                 
 Tuesday,Thursday,Friday and Saturday. 
 The market is long and thin;because it
 is so thin when the stall holders pack
 up they have to wait an hour until    
 they can get out. The council want to 
 change it into a shopping centre so   
 that they can get more tax. Saturday  
 is the most profitable day. Some      
 stallholders work in different markets
 such as Pitsea,Roman Road,Bishop and  
 lots more. Packaging lies about the   
 market. There are lots of different   
 stalls down the market like grocery   
 stalls,clothes stalls,jewellery       
 stalls,sweet stalls,fruit stalls and  
 lots more. There are mostly clothes   
 stalls and grocery stalls.
