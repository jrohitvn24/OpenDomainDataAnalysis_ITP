		<content> All the clubs in the Dowlish Wake area
 are charitable groups set up to       
 provide education, entertainement and 
 services.                             
 The Women's Institute holds its       
 monthly meeting on the first Wednesday
 of the month in the Speke hall,       
 Dowlish Wake, and it has about 25     
 members. Besides its monthly meeting  
 members help with other groups in the 
 village to provide and support village
 amenities.                            
 The Village Hall Committee is composed
 of representatives from the village   
 and local organisations, and is       
 responsible for the finances, running 
 and maintenance of the hall.          
 The Playing Field Committee is        
 likewise responsible for the village  
 palying field.
