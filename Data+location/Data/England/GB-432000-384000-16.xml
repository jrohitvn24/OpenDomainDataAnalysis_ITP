		<content>{THE GENERAL CEMETERY                  
 Founded in 1836,recently half has been
 levelled to make a recreation area.   
 The remaining area contains the more  
 interesting tombs and monuments e.g.  
{Mark Firth-famous steel maker.}All the
 buildings are "listed" but need       
 repairing but there is no public money
 available.                            
{CONSERVATION AREA                     
 There are five areas in our block.    
 Buildings and trees are protected .   
 New buildings, extensions or          
 alterations must be to a high         
 standard. The{Broomhall estate}is an  
 old{Victorian suburb.}The area        
 declined as it became part of the     
 inner-city. Since l970 this trend has 
 been reversed. People have restored   
 the houses back to family homes. Broom
 Hall,{once derelict is now restored.
