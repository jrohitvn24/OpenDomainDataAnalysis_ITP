Edenbridge has two railway stations -  
one of which is in our area and has a  
line running from Tonbridge to Redhill.
The other line runs from Uckfield to   
Victoria. The trains are frequent and  
use diesel engines. The line in our    
area does not have a ticket office so  
people pay on the train.               
Buses in Edenbridge are fairly good.   
They are clean and the drivers are very

There is also a good taxi service in   
the area.
