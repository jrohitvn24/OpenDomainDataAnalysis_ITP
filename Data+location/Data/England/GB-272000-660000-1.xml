		<title>01BELLSHILL AND MOSSEND</title>
		<content>  Bellshill grew up round a Relief     
 Church (now St Andrew's Church of     
 Scotland) and a group of cottages     
 built on a headland on the Glasgow to 
 Edinburgh Road where it was crossed by
 a North to south Road.This growth was 
 a result of the Industrial Revolution 
 with the discovery of iron and coal in
 the area. Old Bellshill and Mossend   
 housing consisted of Tenement flats   
 and miners' rows now replaced by      
 modern housing built by the District  
 Council and The Scottish Special      
 Housing Association and a few private 
 developers in more recent times.      
   With the loss of the heavy          
 industries there has been a rise in   
 the level of unemployment alleviated  
 by the creation of industrial estates 
 which benefited from the nearby major 
 road system of the M74,the M8 and M73.
