 Mawnan was an isolated parish with a  
 closely knit community who relied on  
 agriculture for their living.         
       With the onset of{transport}the 
 village of Mawnan Smith grew and many 
 retired people moved into the area.   
 With the lack of{industry}in the area 
 now most people have to find          
 employment elsewhere.                 
          Mawnan is an area of out     
 standing natural beauty therefore     
{tourism}is now a major attraction.    
 There are some interesting footpaths  
 along the coast leading to beautiful  
 beaches. The{climate}is warm and sunny
 in the summer when the village is     
 bursting with holidaymakers and in the
 winter it is mild and wet and         
 everything is peaceful and quiet. The 
 local community are very friendly and 
 there are many activities  to join.   </content>
