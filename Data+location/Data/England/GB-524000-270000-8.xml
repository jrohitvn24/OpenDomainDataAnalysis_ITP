		<content> The  greater London expansion scheme  
 in the late fifties brought many new  
 private industries to the town and saw
 the development of the industrial     
 estate. These are mainly light and    
 include plastic, rubber, moulding,    
 engineering, eletronics, construction,
 industries and farm machinery. Skilled
 and unskilled work is also provided   
 by the county and district council and
 also the civil service.The large      
 hospital and county police            
 headquarters also provide employment  
 along with the retail industry.There  
 is an highly productive agricultural  
 industry but in a mechanical age this 
 doesn't provide a high degree of      
 employment but seasonal work is       
 available. The level of unemployment  
 is approximately 10 %.The main British
 Rail route caters for the London      
 commuter.                             </content>
