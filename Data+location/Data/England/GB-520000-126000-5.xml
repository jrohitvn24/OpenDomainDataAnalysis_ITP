		<content> To find out what machinery is needed  
 to run a mixed farm in 1985,we visited
 Mr.Miller,the manager of the Tregear  
 estate. Mr.Miller has the following   
 machinery:a{combine,four tractors}(one
 for spraying weeds,two big tractors   
 for pulling,and a tractor for just    
 going around the farms and cutting    
 the grass that the sheep leave)and a  
 fork lift truck for lifting the bales.
 They do their own repairs on the      
 machinery.The{fork lift}is driven by  
 oil and all the engine does is drive  
 the oil around the machine so if      
 something goes wrong with it they take
 it back to the garage.With one of the 
 tractors they take off the big back   
 wheels and put on the thin wheels for 
 spraying weeds.It has very thin wheels
 so it can go down the tram lines with 
 out damaging the crops.
