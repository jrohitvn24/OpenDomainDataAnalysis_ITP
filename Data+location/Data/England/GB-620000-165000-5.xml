 with a grass landing strip running    
 through the crops. A helicopter and   
 7 light aircraft are kept there in    
 hangers. The field developed to answer
 the need of the amateur flyers and    
 owners. The{AIR MECHANIC}came here in 
 the first days of the airstrip as an  
 owner/flyer. Today he has a small     
 business here. The work consists of   
 rebuilding  veteran   biplanes,

 have learnt to tolerate the airfield  </content>
