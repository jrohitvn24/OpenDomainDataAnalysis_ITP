		<title>18WALKING AND CLIMBING</title>
		<content> People travel great distances to come 
 to Bodmin Moor because it is one of   
 the few places left in the country    
 where people can walk about in a      
 natural environment which is not (yet)
 crowded with other people. The many   
 tors on the moor offer opportunities  
 for climbing.  One of the attractions 
 of climbing to the top of these tors  
 is the wonderful views which can be   
 seen on clear days. For example on the
 top of Brown Willy and Rough Tor it is
 possible to see the north and south   
 coasts of Cornwall at the same time.  
 In the 1950s a party of Buddhist monks
 from Thailand came to Brown Willy and 
 held a religious ceremony because they
 thought it was such a good place.
