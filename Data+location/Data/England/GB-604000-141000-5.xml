		<title>05HINXHILL ESTATE FARM 4</title>
		<content>The two main crops grown at the farm   
are corn and potatoes.It is like any   
other farm,planting crops in the       
autumn and some in the spring,         
harvesting certain crops in July,      
August and others in September.Crop    
rotation is always in force to ensure  
that the soil is always kept in good   
condition.Oil seed rape is used.After  
one season of it being planted,two     
seasons of wheat can flourish on the   
same ground. The farm grows many crops 
including peas, spring barley and      
maize.The grain harvested is sold for  
milling purposes.The grain is loaded   
into lorries then taken to mills in    
England or exported.There is also      
woodland at the farm this includes oak,
chestnut, hardwood, spruce, beech, ash 
and hazel.It is interesting to see that
the Hinxhill Oak mentioned in the last 
Domesday Book is still there today.    </content>
