		<title>15CHICHESTER-LOCAL INTEREST 1</title>
		<content>  An ancient city, Chichester has much 
 of  architectural &amp; historic interest.
 The Chichester  entrenchments  running
 North  from the city  are the earliest
 man-made remains.Flint-faced walls now
 occupy the site  inherited  from  the 
 Romans, clearly  defining the old city
 boundaries. In  Priory Park  is  a    
 mound, all that remains of the  Norman
 motte &amp; bailey castle. Here too is the
 Guildhall,  originally a   part  of  a
 Greyfriars monastery &amp; now part of the
{Chichester and District Museum.}Beyond
 the  city walls is {Jubilee Park} with
 trees  planted  for  Queen Victoria's 
 Jubilee. In  the  narrow  city streets
 are  houses &amp; shops faced in brick and
 flint with  Georgian facades and their
 fire marks  still  in  place.{The Ship
{Hotel}in  North Street, once a private
 house, was  the  venue  for  a  dinner
 attended by{Eisenhower}prior to{D-Day.</content>
