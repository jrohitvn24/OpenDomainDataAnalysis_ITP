 Local Education Authority.  It is     
 Sleights Church Of England School.    
 The others are run by the Order Of The
 Holy Paraclete based at Sneaton       
 Castle.  They are Woodlands and Carr

 aged 5-11.                            
   Woodlands takes children aged 5-11, 
 mainly girls, but a few non-boarding  
 boys.  Carr Hall is the middle school 
 run by the sisters, taking girls aged 
 11-14.
