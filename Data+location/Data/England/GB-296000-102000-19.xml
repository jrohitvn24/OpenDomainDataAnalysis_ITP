		<title>19Where Bradninch folk Work</title>
		<content>    These days, it seems that{Bradninch
 people are not so closely linked      
 workwise with their town, apart from  
 those who farm. Transport tends to be 
 of the private variety and there is   
 evidence of shopping outside of       
 Bradninch. This has a large effect on 
 the local{trader.                     
    We have conducted our own survey of
 where parents of Bradninch children   
 work. It is apparent that more mothers
 have part_time work and this may well 
 be in Bradninch. However, out of a    
 sample of 41, 18 work in Bradninch, 9 
 travel to Exeter, 2 to Silverton, 5 to
 Hele, 1 to Dulford, 1 to Tiverton, 1  
 to Cullompton, 1 to Taunton, 1 to     
 Killerton, 1 to Whimple and 1 travels 
 to various places.                    
    The cottage industries of our town 
 have been mentioned.
