		<content>  {Somers Road}runs, NE to SW, straight
 for half a kilometre. To the east are 
 pre-1900 terraced housing and on the  
 west are blocks of concrete flats,    
 rebuilt after World War II bombing.   
 Although owners/usage change rapidly, 
 a community atmosphere exists. The    
 building of{Winston Churchill Ave}has 
 cut{Somers Road}in half and altered   
 its importance as a transport route.  
  {Elm Grove,}with a morning rush of   
 bikes, cars, buses and pedestrians, is
 a busy shopping thoroughfare. O.A.P.  
 flats have been built and named after 
 previous villas. In the centre, modern
 shops, with flats above, front onto   
 the street, while in the east, older  
 1930's single-storey shops sit in     
 front of older houses. Through time, a
 drop in population density is evident.
