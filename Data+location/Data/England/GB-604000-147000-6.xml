		<content> Ramblers and walkers use the North    
 Downs Way leading to Chilham and      
 Canterbury.  There are many public    
 footpaths. The Wye  Footpath          
 Preservation Society exists to        
 maintain these ancient rights of way  
 and organises walks along the paths.  
 Individuals use them too, often to    
 exercise their dogs. Sponsored walks  
 combine useful exercise with financial
 benefit for charity.  Bridleways are  
 used by horseriders so they often get 
 very muddy. There is coarse fishing on
 the River Stour by permission of the  
 appropriate landowner.  In winter     
 there is pheasant and partridge       
 shooting,foxhunting with the East     
 Kent and beagling with the Wye        
 College pack.
