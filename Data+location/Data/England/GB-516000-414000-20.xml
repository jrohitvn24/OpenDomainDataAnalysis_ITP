		<title>20Hopes and Fears</title>
		<content> The staff of{Eastfield School}were    
 asked for their thoughts on the       
{future:}                              
 Most of them thought the world was in 
 rather a sorry state and expressed a  
 hope that solutions to the famines and
 fighting could be found. The job      
 prospects for school-leavers was also 
 a sore point and arms race proved a   
 worry for many.                       
 The hopes for the future included a   
 more understanding world, a desire for
 people to look for common ground      
 rather than looking for faults in     
 others and a hope that the present    
 inbalance in wealth between the       
 "haves" and "have-nots" could be      
 bridged.                              
 The biggest hope for the future is    
 PEACE.
