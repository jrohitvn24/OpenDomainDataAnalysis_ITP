		<content>South of White Lodge is the            
Tercentenary Plantation planted in 1937
to mark the 300th anniversary of the   
founding of the Park and to commemorate
the Coronation of George 6th who was   
born at White Lodge. In the plantation 
of trees one finds signs of three      
mammals to be found in the Park, the   
grey squirrel, the rabbit and the      
badger.                                
In the Isabella Plantation, a woodland 
garden, there are many exotic trees,   
planted mostly since World War 2 ; the 
Metasequoia, a conifer from China;     
Rhododendron, Azalea, Camellia and     
Magnolia. This plantation is crowded   
with visitors on Sunday afternoons in  
May and June when the Azaleas are in   
bloom.                                 
In the Park there are many different   
grasses, rushes and sedges growing.
