		<title>01CODMORE HILL AND NORTH HEATH</title>
		<content>  At the southern end of this farming  
 area, Codmore Hill runs east to west  
 at a height of about 200 feet above   
 sea level. It continues eastward to   
 Borough Farm and Beedings where the   
 ridge is over 300 feet high.          
  To the south of the hill are the     
 gallops of a racehorse owner, from    
 which there is a wide panaromic view  
 over farmlands to the South Downs.    
  To the north the view centres on the 
 Toat Monument and its adjacent        
 orchards.                             
  In the extreme north west of the     
 block runs the river Arun and to the  
 east of the river, the overgrown bed  
 of the former Wey and Arun Canal.     
  From south west to north east runs   
 the main A29 Chichester to London     
 road; with the Portsmouth to London   
 railway roughly parallel to its east.
