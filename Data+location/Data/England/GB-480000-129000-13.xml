		<content>      The employment of people in our  
 vicinty consists of many different    
 jobs.                                 
      In our area there are many shops 
 and public houses; there are a couple 
 of newsagents, two schools, which     
 obviously provide many teaching jobs, 
 and a post office and several banks.  
 Building Societies are also quite     
 familiar in Liphook and we have a     
 large one near the school.            
      In our twelve blocks there are   
 two farms and two public houses. The  
 two farms are that of crop rowing and 
 milking cows.The land is not really   
 rocky or steep or rough grazing like  
 the type of land that sheep are kept  
 so the farmland should provide many   
 jobs and be a big provider for jobs.  
      There are also army camps and    
 these provide many jobs in the armed  
 forces and combat camps.              </content>
