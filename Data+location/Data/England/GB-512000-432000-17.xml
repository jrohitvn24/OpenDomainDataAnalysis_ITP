		<title>17  Living on Longhill Estate</title>
		<content>   Mr and Mrs Glenton live in Parkhurst
 Close on Longhill Estate. They moved  
 into the{house}when it was first built
 31 years ago. Before that they lived  
 in a big old flat on Hessle Road.     
   They have seen the area change over 
 the years. When they first moved the  
 rent  was 24s (Â£1.40). Now it is      
 about Â£20 per week, but in 1982 they  
 bought their{house}from the Council.  
 When the estate was first built       
 Holderness High Road was only a       
 single carriage-way. To reach it from 
 Longhill you had to cross a ditch by  
 walking along a plank. There were few 
 grassed areas, not many trees, and no 
 proper pavements. Mrs Glenton         
 remembers that she had to buy from    
 mobile shops which came round the     
 estate.
