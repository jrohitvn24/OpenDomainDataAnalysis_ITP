		<content>   The Juniors building was built in   
 1902.The Infants building was built   
 in 1952. The hall was built in 1979.  
 The grounds are 391 square metres.    
 In 1985 there were 112 children in    
 the school. There were 47 girls and   
 54 boys. Les Landes school is made out
 of granite as are most old Jersey     
 buildings. There are 6 teachers at Les
 Landes and 5 classes.                 
    We did a survey of mums and dads   
 working in St. Ouen and St.           
 Helier. 54 parents work in St. Ouen   
 and 26 work in St. Helier. We asked   
 them if their mums or dads work in    
 farming, banking, tourism or work for 
 the States of Jersey as these are the 
 main sources of employment in Jersey. 
 Four of them  do banking,twenty five  
 do States work and twenty seven do    
 farming.
