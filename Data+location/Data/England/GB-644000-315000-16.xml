		<content> Fashion in the 80's is quite          
 interesting at the moment.It has      
 changed a lot because now the fashion 
 for girls is short,tight skirts and   
 low backed tops.For boys it is mainly 
 baggy jeans with zips and pockets in  
 with a baggy jumper or a Chinese      
 writing top.Fashion for hair styles   
 in the 80's is short,spiky hair and   
 also either bleached or streaked      
 hair.Some people are going for hair   
 which has got lots of colours in such 
 as bright red,luminous green,yellow   
 and orange etc...People go for        
 luminous socks as well and belts also 
 greys and blacks are in fashion.In the
 schools you have to wear uniform which
 is not fashionable.It is a white      
 shirt,blue skirt,blue jumper,and in   
 the summer a blue and white checked   
 dress.Fashion is usually brightly     
 coloured clothing.                    </content>
