		<title>17Local village events</title>
		<content> On Saturday June 29th 1985, Lastingham
 &amp; Spaunton joined together in         
 celebrating the{100th aniversary}of   
 the village school,which is now used  
 as the village hall. The residents of 
 the two villages provided food for a  
 fabulous buffet supper which included 
 a huge fruit cake. This was cut by our
 eldest resident who was 91 years old. 
 Several attended in victorian costume 
 &amp; many guests were former residents   
 who had moved away in recent years.   
 This was one of the many social events
 when all the villagers with differing 
 lifestyles &amp; attitudes joined together
 on an equal footing to celebrate a    
 special event. Perhaps this would not 
 have been possible in the days when   
 the school was built.
