		<title>03GAMES WE PLAY</title>
		<content>  On our playground and at home we play
 such games as Kinger,Polo,Kerbs,Hide  
 and Seek and Touch.Kinger, to start   
 the game the players stand in a circle
 with legs apart.A ball is dropped in  
 the middle of the circle and if the   
 ball goes through somebody's legs     
 that person is "IT".The player then   
 takes the ball and chases the rest of 
 the group.The player throws the ball  
 at the rest of the players.If the ball
 hits another player that person is    
 also"up".This continues until all are 
 caught.                               
      Kerbs, you need 2 players and a  
 ball.One player stands on one side of 
 the road,the other player stands on   
 the opposite side.One player throws   
 the ball and tries to bounce it off   
 the kerb.If the ball hits the opponent
 the player who throw the ball gets one
 point.The game continues like that.   </content>
