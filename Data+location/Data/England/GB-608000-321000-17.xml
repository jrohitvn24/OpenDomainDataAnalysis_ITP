		<title>17Where our parents lived.</title>
		<content> Most people's parents in my class have
 not lived in Reepham all their life.  
 Many of them have lived in Reepham    
 between 11 to 20 years, which could   
 mean that they had just had their     
 child and wanted a bigger house.      
 Eighteen people have moved here       
 between 1 to 10 years.Twelve people   
 have moved to Reepham in the last year
 and more are still coming.Only one    
 parent has lived in Reepham between 20
 to 30 years.Only three parents have   
 lived in Reepham all thier life. Nine 
 people's parents came from Norwich and
 nine from London and four from        
 Essex.So most people's parents came   
 from East Anglia or nearby . Five of  
 the parents came from Sussex,Stockport
 ,Lincon and Hertfordshire. Three      
 people's parents come from Scotland   
 ,Jersey and Australia.
