		<content> Most of the houses were built in red  
 coloured bricks probably from the old 
 brickworks in the next                
 village,Cubley.The newest building is 
 a bungalow 1 year old.There are 14    
 Council houses opposite the school    
 built in 1964.On one red brick farm   
 there is a corrugated asbestos roof   
 .It dates from 1925 when you could not
 get slates after the 1st World War.The
 house has windows blocked up for the  
 18thC window tax.The shelter, now a   
 bus stop,is dated 1897 and once       
 sheltered the pump.The school dates   
 from 1872.The timbered Manor House    
 dates from 1790 and is now a racing   
 stable.The old village bakery and post
 office was in one of the outbuildings.
 Interesting old buildings include 4   
 ex-pubs.The present pub may have been 
 a brewhouse.There was also a malthouse
 a blacksmith and a creamery.          </content>
