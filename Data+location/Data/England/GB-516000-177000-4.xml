 In our school there are 202 children. 
 55 of them speak a language other than
 English at home.                      
                                       
 The families of these children came   
 from various parts of the world. Most 
 were from Asia. Altogether, nine      
 Asian, six European and five African  
 languages are spoken at Grange        
 Middle School.                        
                                       
 Apart from English the most common    
 languages spoken are: Urdu (8), Polish
 (6), Punjabi (6), French (5), Nepali  
 (4) and Arabic (4).                   
                                       
 In our area there is a Greek School,  
 a Polish School and an Armenian       
 School. Children go to them after     
 day school or at weekends.
