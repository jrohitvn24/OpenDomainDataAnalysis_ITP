		<title>02 High Gosforth Park</title>
		<content> High Gosforth Park is a large 800 acre
estate near Wideopen, which belongs    
to the H.G.P. Company.We met Mr Smith, 
the Managing Director of the company,  
who told us that the company was       
founded in 1881.                       
 The company leases land inside the    
park to the following organisations,the
Golf Centre,Northumberland Golf Club,  
the Scout Camp, the  Caravan Club,the  
Squash Club,and the Exibition Centre.  
Woodland in the park is conserved by   
Northumberland Natural History         
Society.The majority of the land owned 
by H.G.P. Company is the Race Course.  
Mr Smith,the clerk of the course,is    
responsible for the racing programme.  
Gosforth Park is probably the main     
race-track of the North East.The most  
famous and well known race is the      
Northumberland Plate.It is sometimes   
called "the Pitman's Derby".           </content>
