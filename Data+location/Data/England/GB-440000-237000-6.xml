		<content>  Bishop Carpenter School is a small   
village school in {North Newington}    
near Banbury. It is quite a small      
school because it only takes {98       
children}.  The school is on School    
Lane and has a sloping field at the    
side. The school was built in {1853}   
out of local stone.                    
  The farthest distance a pupil has to 
come to the school is 6 miles. The     
school field is not a proper public    
field but it is used as one. The       
school was named after {Bishop         
Carpenter} who was the Bishop of       
Oxford. He is still alive at the grand 
age of 90.                             
  The most common villages that the    
children come from are Broughton, North
Newington and Shutford. The school has 
3 classes, 3 full time teachers and 2  
part time teachers. The children have  
to wear a uniform.         Jody Lucas  </content>
