		<title>05ALL SAINTS CHURCH, CHEBSEY</title>
		<content> There has been a place of worship at  
 Chebsey since Saxon days.  In the     
 churchyard are the remains of an      
 ancient cross.  This is a scheduled   
 monument.                             
 The present Church dates from Norman  
 times.  The tradition of Master       
 Mason's marks can be seen both in the 
 13th-century stonework and in the     
 modern joinery.  There are 4 bells and
 a 2-manual organ.  An unusual feature 
 is that the turret stair of the tower 
 is external.                          
 Congregations average 23 people.      
 There is no choir.  The Priest is also
 in charge of the neighbouring parishes
 of Ellenhall and Norton Bridge.  A    
 service is held at Chebsey most       
 Sundays. During the last year the     
 Priest conducted 4 baptisms, 1        
 wedding and 2 funerals.
