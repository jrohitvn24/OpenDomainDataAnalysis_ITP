		<content> This block is mixed farming land,     
 renowned for its good stock rearing   
 qualities and strong soil which will  
 grow hops. There are 23 farms in the  
 area with a total acreage of 2,700,   
 some of this land lying outside the   
 area. Three farms produce milk, seven 
 grow hops, there is one intensive pig 
 farm, and two farms have semi-inten-  
 sive poultry. Three quarters of the   
 farm land is in pasture for cattle and
 sheep. The rest grows hops, corn, and 
 fruit -  apples, cider apples, plums, 
 blackcurrants, blackberries, and rasp-
 berries.  Every farm used to grow     
 cider apples and produce cider for    
 their farm workers. The cattle breed  
 has changed over the years, it was    
 once all pure Herefords, but now most 
 cattle are Hereford crosses or        
 Friesians.
