		<title>12Hendon Rd. in the 1930's 2</title>
		<content>{CONT from page 11 }                   
 The corner shop sold nearly everything
 from clothes to food.They ran clubs so
 that people could pay so much a week  
 for the goods.                        
 There was a school called Hendon Board
 School.There were about 50 children in
 each class.The clssroom windows were  
 high up so that the children would not
 be distracted by things that were     
 happening outside.The walls were      
 tiled.The classrooms were very dull.  
 Today Hendon Road has changed.Shops   
 and houses have gone.They have been   
 replaced by factories and blocks of   
 flats.From a bustling road of the     
 1930's it is now quiet except for     
 workers going to the factories.
