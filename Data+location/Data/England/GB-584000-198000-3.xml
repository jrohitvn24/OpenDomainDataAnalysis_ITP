		<title>03Cold Norton Golf Course.</title>
		<content> The golf couse has a public foot path 
 where people can walk.If you take your
 dog it must stay on the lead.You get  
 a lot of golfers at a weekend.There is
 a   house at the top of a hill        
 overlooking the golf course  (Beacon  
 Hill), which at the moment is owned by
 Mrs Hawes who is one of the teachers  
 at our  school. The golf course       
 belongs to the Three Rivers Country   
 Club.Quite alot of people play golf   
 there and is the main reason that     
 people outside Cold Norton have hard  
 of the village. There are three ponds 
 which make the area look quite        
 attractive .                          
 When the school has its' May Fair the 
 Cross Country Race in the morning goes
 across the Golf Course , which seems  
 to annoy some of the Golfers.
