		<title>14The Kinwarton Oak Trees</title>
		<content>      Kinwarton has two oak trees which
 were planted for special occasions.   
                                       
      The Jubilee Oak was planted in   
 1887 by Captain Gerard for Queen      
 Victoria's Golden Jubilee. Its        
 circumference is now 2.44m or two     
 armspans. Captain Gerard lived in     
 Kinwarton House and he was very good  
 to the poor. Tramps were given food by
 him and a road in Alcester was named  
 after him.                            
                                       
      In l953 the Great Alne and       
 Kinwarton Coronation Committee planted
 an oak to commemorate the coronation  
 of Queen Elizabeth II. It is now      
 0.98m in circumference. This is just  
 under one armspan.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
