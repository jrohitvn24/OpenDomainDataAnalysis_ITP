		<title>11BUCKINGHAM ALMSHOUSES.</title>
		<content> The Almshouses were built 150 years   
 ago. There are twelve residents, some 
 of whom are ill. Each house holds six 
 people. Money from several small      
 charities has been invested in the    
 houses since they were built;although 
 there is no staff,and the residents   
 must pay ten pounds per week to live  
 there. This rent does not include the 
 price of meals. People living there   
 can have visitors whenever they want  
 to.
