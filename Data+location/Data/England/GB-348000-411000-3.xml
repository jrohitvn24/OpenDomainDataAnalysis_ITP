		<title>03Parbold Hilldale Roads</title>
		<content>The main road from Parbold to Hilldale 
is the B5246,continuing north west it  
leads to Rufford.In the areas nearest  
to the main housing estates there are  
pavements along either side of the     
road.On the minor roads there are very 
few pavements,there are grass verges or
hedgerows bordering the roads.These    
side roads are narrower,and tend to be 
more winding than the main road.Signs  
clearly indicate the many PUBLIC       
FOOTPATHS,pointing in the direction and
stating the distance to villages and   
farms.One footpath went round a small  
lake where ducklings swam towards the  
island in the middle.Many footpaths go 
through fields,some through            
woodland.Many footpaths lead up to an  
old windmill,several go through the    
land at Harrock Hall.The footpaths     
seem well worn so must be well-used.
