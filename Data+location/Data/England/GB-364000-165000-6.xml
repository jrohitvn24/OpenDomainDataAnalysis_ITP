		<title>06Attitudes To School</title>
		<content> Question 1 was:                       
 Do you like school?                   
  The results to this question were:   
 1st yr class yes 24 no 7 don't know 0 
 2nd yr class yes 5 no 12 don't know 1 
 3rd yr class yes 7 no 6 don't know 15 
 4th yr class yes 12 no 10 don't know 8
  As you can see the 1st years like    
 school,but as they got older we found 
 more people didn't know if they liked 
 school(in other words you don't like  
 or dislike school but you have attend.
 ) We found that Maths was considered  
 the most important subject by all age 
 groups,Maths was also the most        
 disliked subject.In the 1st and 2nd   
 year Art is the favourite subject.But 
 in the 3rd and 4th year Games is the  
 favourite.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
