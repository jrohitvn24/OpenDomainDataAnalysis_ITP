 there was the longest{coal mining     
{strike}ever.Our area was affected .The
{N.C.B.}is the largest employer of men 
 in the area so not only were the      
{miners}themselves involved but all    
 members of the community _ traders of 
 all sorts. The strike was about jobs  
 and pit closures.It was an unhappy and
 violent time and caused much distress 
 to many families.                     
  The social centre was the hub of all 
 the{N.U.M.}activities from deployment 
 of pickets to feeding miners          
 families;dealing with money problems  
 or the cutting of electrical supplies.
  A ladies committee was formed and    
 they delt with the supply and

 were served at a cost of Â£20,097.The  
 food was got from local traders,door
