		<content> The following information was gathered
 from forty-six 4-5 year olds. Twenty- 
 one children were born locally and of 
 these six parents and five grand-     
 parents have always lived in the      
 village. The households range from    
 three to seven people, twenty-four    
 having four, and fifteen five people. 
 Most live in houses built twenty to a 
 hundred years ago and all except one  
 are centrally heated by oil, solid    
 fuel or electricity there being no gas
 in the village. Twenty also have open 
 fires. All the houses have gardens    
 with trees and flowers and over half  
 grow fruit and vegetables. Only two   
 families do not keep a pet, the most  
 popular being cats and dogs. Within   
 this group only two children did not  
 have between one and two years        
 pre-school experience in either a     
 nursery or kindergarden.              </content>
