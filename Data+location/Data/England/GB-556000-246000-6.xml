		<title>06THE RIVER GRANTA IN LINTON</title>
		<content>   The river Granta,a tributary of the 
 Cam,flows through the centre of Linton
 cutting the High Street in two. It is 
 one of the village's greatest         
 attractions. The river is pollution   
 free and it contains eels,catfish and 
 rainbow trout.There is an abundance of
 wildlife on the river banks including 
 herons and kingfishers.There are also 
 several species of duck including     
 mallard,muscovy and teal.Recent       
 additions include several Canada      
 geese.                                
   The river used to flood the centre  
 of the village quite regularly but in 
 1968,after a particularly serious     
 flooding,the river was widened and a  
 new bridge was built.This seems to    
 have solved the problem.
