		<content> The ghost of Scraley Road             
                          This ghost   
 has been sighted on several occasions 
 and although silent appears to be the 
 ghost of a farm worker who has been   
 stabbed in the back with a pitchfork. 
                                       
 The ghosts of Boucherne               
                        This is a house
 on Holloway Road which is believed to 
 have once been the site of a Roman    
 burial ground. A ghost of a young boy 
 has been seen in one room and the     
 silhouette of a hanging man in        
 another.                              
                                       
 The ghost of Garden Cottage           
                            This is a  
 restored cottage on the site of an    
 older house destroyed by fire. The    
 ghost of a boy warning of a fire and  
 objects moving have been reported.    </content>
