		<title>01Holt Heath Nature Reserve</title>
		<content>     At one time in the last century   
 much of the land in S.E.Dorset was    
 heathland,in our own century the      
 heathland has come under pressure for 
 other uses of the land,for improved   
 pasture,forestry and housing.Much of  
 this once large area has become       
 fragmented,these areas in turn have   
 come under pressure from neighbouring 
 land users.To conserve as many of     
 these larger fragments before they are
 lost groups like the Dorset Naturalist
 Trust,National Trust and Nature       
 Conservancy Council have been trying  
 to conserve such sites The N.C.C.     
 purchased the Holt Heath site in      
 1981 and it is at present managed by a
 part time warden,who with volunteer   
 workers is doing much to manage the   
 site.Much of the S.portion of the site
 lies out of this survey area,this     
 block N. of Bull Burrow &amp; Holt Forest.</content>
