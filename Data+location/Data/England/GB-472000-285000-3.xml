		<title>03Rights of Way</title>
		<content> Many people in Harborough use the     
 footpaths along the canal and country 
 lanes for weekend walks. However, less
 follow the rights of way over the     
 fields,either because they are unaware
 of the footpath  route or because they
 have difficulty following it.The      
 attitude of Harborough Rambling Club  
 is one of persuasion of,and           
 co-operation with,the local farmers.  
 They are working to have the footpath 
 routes marked,the stiles and fences on
 the paths maded easy to climb, and    
 restrictions,such as barbed wire or   
 overgrown hedges,cleared.They feel    
 too that walters should respect the   
 proper route.Often, however,the rights
 of way is difficult to find.For       
 example the route from Green Lane to  
 East Farndon has such obstructios as a
 steep,overgrown stream,difficult      
 fences and alarge wheat field .       </content>
