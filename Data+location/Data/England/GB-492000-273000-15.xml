		<title>15Little Addington Greens</title>
		<content>In 1975,the occupants of the drive     
decided to look after this land-rather 
than leave the land derelict.The land  
has,during the last 10 years,become to 
be considered as "The Village Green"   
it is now a large expanse of grass,    
with trees paid for and planted by the 
residents of the drive,and the grass   
cut by the residents of the drive and  
the Parish Council.The owners of this  
land are the family who sold the       
remainder of Dovecote Drive land to    
house developers,and who own several   
properties in the village,and a lot of 
acres to the south of the village.A    
bungalow,Arnage,adjacent to the green  
was purchased by this family in October
1984.Without futher occupation,this    
property together with the green were  
offered for sale.There is therefore a  
high likelihood that the character of  
the village is about to change.        </content>
