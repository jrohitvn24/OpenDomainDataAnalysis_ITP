 Mr Roy Harrold's farm in Stoke Holy   
 Cross has animals an grows crops. The 
 four crops grown are wheat, barley,   
 sugar beet and hay. Other crops grown 
 in this area include potatoes, beans  
 and peas. The farmer has to plough and
 cultivate the soil, plant the seeds   
 and then spray them to keep weeds and 
 insects at bay. Then they have to be  
 harvested,                            
 The fifty milking cows and fifty fat  
 cattle bring in more money then the   
 actual arable crops. The cattle have  
 to be tended daily, and the farmer has
 to keep a sharp lookout for any       
 diseases such as mastitis, and milk   
 fever which would kill of not spotted 
 at the right time.                    
 National membership of the European   
 Economic Community affects the crops  
 and animals very much.                </content>
