 The Ashridge Estate is run and        
 organised by the local National Trust 
 Group. The estate is managed by a     
 Warden and his staff who run the      
 woodlands as a commercial venture     
 operating from a woodyard. Products   
 include timber for fencing, gates and 
 post in general. Many of the products 
 come from the thinnings taken from the
 young plantations.                    
 Just off the square is a shop and     
 information centre at the Bridgewater 
 Momument. The Trust also sets out and 
 maintains the woodlands for amenity   
 use. This includes nature trails,     
 footpaths and bridleways.
