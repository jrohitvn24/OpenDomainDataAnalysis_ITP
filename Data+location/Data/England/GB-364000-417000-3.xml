		<content> Spitler's Edge marks the County       
 Constituency Parliamentary Boundary   
 between the Darwen and Rossendale     
 Constituency and the Chorley          
 Constituency.  The Civil Parishes     
 covering this area (apart from the    
 Darwen Moor area in the north-east    
 corner) are North Turton, Tockholes,  
 Withnell and Wheelton which have      
 parish councils and Anglezarke which  
 has an annual parish meeting.  The    
 Civil Parish of North Turton comprises
 the villages of Edgworth, Chapeltown, 
 Entwistle and Belmont and the         
 surrounding countrysides.  North      
 Turton Parish includes a small        
 portion of the ancient Sharples       
 township. Anglezarke Parish consists  
 of only approximately 30 dwellings.
