		<content> The earliest mention of a school at   
 Horton dates from 1695.  It was called
 Horton in Ribblesdale Grammar School, 
 and until 1854 was held in the house  
 in the corner of the churchyard.      
                                       
 Mr Barker, The Headmaster, teaches the
 Juniors and Miss Hartley teaches the  
 Infants.  At present there are 33     
 pupils aged from five to ten years.   
                                       
 The children from Horton walk or cycle
 to school and those from the far end  
 of the village come by car.  Children 
 who live at Selside, Helwith Bridge   
 and Stainforth travel to school by    
 taxi.  Children come from Stainforth  
 now because their village school was  
 closed last year.                     
 Dinner is cooked in the school kitchen
 and everyone except one girl stays    
 for school dinners.                   </content>
