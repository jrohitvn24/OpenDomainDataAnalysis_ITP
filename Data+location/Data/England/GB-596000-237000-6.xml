		<title>06 Footpaths in Polstead</title>
		<content> A footpaths working party has been set
up in the last three years and meets   
when necessary to clear footpaths and  
waymark disputed paths.A new definitive
 map ,drawn by a local "newcomer"is    
awaiting publication,but may be viewed 
outside the village hall,or purchased  
at the Post office.There are still some
 footpaths that run through land       
recently used for building and the new 
owners will not accept that the        
footpaths still exist.An elderly       
resident comments that most footpaths  
are now signposted except the main     
one,the path from what used to be the  
shop leading past the Red Barn and out 
at Spring Hill.This used to be a       
favourite family walk and one could    
always meet four or five families along
this path.The paths have such names as 
Cherry Billy's Lane and Philly Hick's  
Lane and are still numerous.           </content>
