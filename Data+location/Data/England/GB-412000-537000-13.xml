		<title>13THE WORK OF THE POLICE.</title>
		<content> During the past few years Durham      
 County Constabulary has tried to      
 integrate it's policemen within the   
 local communities. In Tow Law our     
 "local" policeman is P.C. Hall.       
                                       
{The policing of Tow Law and district  
{is controlled from the police-station 
{at Stanhope (9 miles), though there is
{a station at Crook (4 miles). A total 
{of 8 constables and 1 sergeant are    
{responsible for the area.             
                                       
{The policemen have to make sure that  
{everyone abides by the law. They also 
{spend a lot of their time helping     
{people with any problems they may     
{have.                                 
                                       
 Each policeman carries a pocket radio,
 pocket book, hand-cuffs (rarely used),
 truncheon, whistle and office keys.   </content>
