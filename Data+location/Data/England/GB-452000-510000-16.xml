		<title>16GREAT AYTON LOCAL HISTORY</title>
		<content> "Ayton" means a farm by a river.      
 People have lived here since at least 
 the Bronze Age.  In the original      
 Domesday Book the village was         
 variously called Atum, Atun and Aton. 
 At that time it had 3 manors and was a
 thriving agricultural community.  The 
 first church was built about 8OO AD.  
 Niches in the pews were for           
 anti-plague disinfectant.  The cemetry
 was enlarged after the 1349 Black     
 Death.  The Skottowe family, after    
 whom a housing estate is named, once  
 owned the village.  There was a weekly
 market in the 13th century.  In the   
 18th century, many handloom weavers   
 lived here, then Whinstone quarrymen  
 came in the 19th century after which  
 the "iron rush" led to a sudden       
 increase in the housing area though   
 Ayton is now a dormitory town for the 
 Cleveland industrial area.            </content>
