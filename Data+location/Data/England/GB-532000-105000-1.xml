 the block that we have studied is     
 situated on the eastern side of       
 Brighton. It comprises four quite     
 distinct regions:

 Three schools have been involved in   
 the project:{Whitehawk Middle School}

 The topography of the area is Down    
 Land with the valleys being filled    
 with the housing,shops and industry.  
 Most of the development of the central
 area took place from about 1800 and   
 the estates from the 1920's onwards.
