        Housing in the block is very   
 limited. There is one row of houses   
 built on Queens Road. (O.S.Ref.  TA   
 200148)                               
        Out of a total of 18 houses, 7 
 are now lived in and the rest are     
 derelict. The houses were built pre   
 1930 to serve the needs of the dock   
 workers. Nearby was the terminus of   
 the electric tramway that brought the 
 workers from Grimsby. The tramway was 
 brought into use in 1912 with the     
 Queens Road extension opened in 1913. 
 The tramway closed in 1961 and the    
 last trams were second hand stock from
 Gateshead. A regular bus service made 
 the houses unnecessary and it is      
 unlikely that they will ever be       
 renovated.
