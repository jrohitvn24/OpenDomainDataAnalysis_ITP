		<content>{LANDSCAPE }The parish of North        
 Leverton with Habblethorpe is         
 the longest named parish in the       
 country. The parish is long and       
 narrow, stretching from the river     
 Trent to the outskirts of Retford,    
 with other parishes, but a short space
 between. The land generally slopes to 
 the Trent from 20 metres high. Arable 
 farming predominates with cereals, oil
 seed rape, peas, potatoes, soft fruit 
 and some grass land. The windmill is a
 feature of the sky line with the      
 churches now dwarfed by the power     
 stations just over the boundary.      
 Roads from West Burton and Cottam     
 power stations connect with the main  
 roads at Retford. The railway line is 
 still used for transporting coal to   
 the power stations.
