		<content> THE AREA IS PART OF THE LOW-LYING VALE
 OF YORK. MOST OF THE LAND IS FARMED.  
 THE RIVERS NIDD AND OUSE RELIEVE THE  
 MONOTONY AS THEY FLOW BETWEEN STEEP   
 BANKS. THERE ARE MANY SMALL TREE      
 PLANTATIONS KNOWN AS {RASHES}AND TWO  
 COUNTRY PARKS USED FOR GRAZING. BOTH  
 RIVERS ARE SUBJECT TO SEVERE FLOODING 
 AND FLOOD BANKS AND CAUSEWAYS HAVE    
 BEEN CONSTRUCTED. HALF THE BLOCK      
 REMAINS AS WATER MEADOWS OR {INGS}AND 
 IMPROVED GRASSLAND. THERE ARE MANY    
 DRAINAGE DITCHES, SOME OLD AND WINDING
 ARE FRINGED BY TREES AND SHRUBS. MANY 
 OLD HEDGES HAVE SURVIVED BUT SOME     
 LARGE FIELDS HAVE BEEN MADE. THE      
 GENERAL FLATNESS OF THE AREA BRINGS   
 INTO PROMINENCE DISTANT PLANTATIONS SO
 THAT THE LANDSCAPE APPEARS WELL       
 WOODED.INTO 2 COUNTRY PARKS FOREIGN   
 SPECIMEN TREES HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED   
 AND THE OPEN SPACES PRESERVED.        </content>
