		<content>                                       
Exning is an old Suffolk village about 
1000 years older than the nearby town  
of Newmarket.Before Newmarket was      
formed Exning was said to have been a  
Roman settlement and many local        
historians think that it was quite     
big.One of the historians is           
Christopher Taylor of Cambridge. Saint 
Etheldreda (founder of the monastery   
in Ely) was born and christened in     
Exning.Also in Exning is Wendreds well 
named after St Wendred.
