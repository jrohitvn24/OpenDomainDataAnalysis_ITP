		<title>02THE LANDSCAPE OF TURTON</title>
		<content>   The area divides into two           
 contrasting sections, with the        
 residential area of Egerton to the S  
 and S.W.and open countryside over the 
 remainder. The area is hilly,         
 increasingly so to the north, and  is 
 a mixture of open moorland and        
 reforested areas. Three landscaped man
 made reservoirs add to the overall    
 attractiveness of the area.           
   The area permits the development and
 conservation of a wide variety of     
 flora, animal and bird life. There are
 large reforested areas of coniferous  
 trees, and numerous copses of natural 
 deciduous trees. The area is rocky,   
 with many outcrops and disused        
 quarries. The soil is thin, moorland  
 areas being covered by clumps of      
 springy grass. 7 miles of footpaths   
 permit the enjoyment of the area.
