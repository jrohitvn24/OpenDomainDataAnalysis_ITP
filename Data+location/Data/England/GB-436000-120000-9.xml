		<title>09Crampmoor Farm - a visit</title>
		<content>{Crampmoor Farm, Crampmoor Lane, Romsey
 Our visit to Crampmoor Farm took place
 on Monday 17th. June, 1985. The farm  
 is mainly a dairy farm though the     
 owner(Mr. Lawes) is now starting to   
 breed fish. The farm looks small.     
 Behind the house is the milking       
 parlour. Four cows can be milked at   
 once and whilst being milked they eat 
 cownuts which are full of protein.They
 are milked by machine and the milk is 
 stored in a large cooling tank which  
 holds 502 litres. The milk is sent to 
 Unigate to be bottled and sold. The   
 farm has 37 cows and thousands of     
 fish. The herd are Jersey and Guernsey
 cows. The farm has 35.6 hectres(88    
 acres) of land. A vast area that was  
 useless was turned into ponds for     
 breeding fish. Mr. Lawes runs the farm
 singlehanded because he cannot afford 
 help.                                 </content>
