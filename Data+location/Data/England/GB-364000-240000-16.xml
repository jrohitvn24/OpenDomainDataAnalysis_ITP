		<title>16ASHPERTON - NEW BUILDING</title>
		<content> Over the past 150 years there were    
 only eight houses built in the village
 until in the early 1970s when the     
 County Planning Authority decided that
 they would allow housing development  
 on the east side of the main road.    
 Land down Church Lane and around the  
 Church was bought by builders in      
 single plots and two larger sites     
 which eventually gave the village a   
 development of eighteen houses.       
 Together with two half timbered houses
 which have been completely renovated  
 these are the homes of most of the    
 people newly_arrived in the village.  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
