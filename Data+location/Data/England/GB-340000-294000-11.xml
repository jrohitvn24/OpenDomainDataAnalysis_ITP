 at{Duckley Nap}. The{flint}dates back 
 to the early{Bronze Age .Mr Carruthers
 our headmaster told us that there were
 pieces of{flint}found there.So we     
 started looking along the track.We had
 luck for{Beccy}shouted" I think we    
 have found some{flint}." She pulled a 
 small{flake}out of the ground,shook   
 the mud off and ran to Mr Carruthers .
