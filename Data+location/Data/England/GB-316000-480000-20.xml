		<title>20MILLOM FELL RESCUE TEAM</title>
		<content> MILLOM HAS A MOUNTAIN RESCUE TEAM WITH
 ABOUT 35 MEMBERS. THEY ARE ALL        
 VOLUNTEERS AND HAVE JOBS IN THE LOCAL 
 SCHOOLS, PRISON, FACTORIES, ETC. THE  
 TEAM WAS FORMED AFTER A PLANE CRASHED 
 ON BLACK COMBE ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO.
 UNLIKE SOME OF THE VERY BUSY TEAMS,   
 MILLOM ONLY GETS A FEW CALL-OUTS EACH 
 YEAR AND OCCASIONALLY HELP IS GIVEN TO
 FARMERS WHO HAVE SHEEP BURIED IN SNOW 
 DRIFTS. EACH MONTH THERE IS A PRACTICE
 WHEN TEAM MEMBERS GET TOGETHER AND GO 
 THROUGH THE PROCEEDURES THAT ARE USED 
 IN REAL ACCIDENTS OR SEARCHES. THE    
 TEAM USES A FORD TRANSIT CREW BUS TO  
 CARRY EQUIPMENT, LIKE RADIOS, ROPES, A
 STRETCHER AND FIRST AID SACKS, TO ANY 
 INCIDENT. ALL THE MONEY TO KEEP THE   
 TEAM GOING COMES FROM GRANTS OR FROM  
 FUND RAISING EFFORTS BY TEAM MEMBERS. 
{ALWAYS TAKE GREAT CARE ON THE FELLS.}
