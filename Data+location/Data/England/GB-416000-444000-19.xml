		<title>19BURLEY IN WHARFEDALE</title>
		<content> Burley-in-Wharfedale is a village six 
 kilometres east of Otley. Until the   
 railway was built it was a farming    
 village, but now it is mainly a place 
 for people to live who work in        
 Bradford or Leeds. The old cottages   
 which the farm workers used to live in
 have all been smartened up with white 
 paint and new windows and doors, and a
 lot of new estates have been built all
 round the old centre of the village.  
 People move into the new estates and  
 then object to any more new houses    
 being built. The prices in the Burley 
 shops are much higher than in Otley   
 supermarkets, so the people who go to 
 live in Burley must be richer than    
 Otley people. When the school has     
 hometime there are lots of big cars   
 outside the gates to collect the      
 children. They must not like walking!
