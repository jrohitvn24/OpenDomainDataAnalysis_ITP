		<title>13JACK THE GIANT KILLER</title>
		<content> Long, long ago, the Giant Cormoran    
 lived on the island of St. Michael's  
 Mount. Also living was a farmer with  
 his son, Jack. The giant kept coming  
 to eat cattle, sheep, pigs and even   
 people themselves. One day the people 
 had a meeting. Jack said, "I'll get   
 rid of the giant for you." At evening,
 when the sun had just gone down, Jack 
 went up tothe giant's castle with his 
 sword and his father's spade. He dug a
 pit and covered it with branches and  
 put soil on top to disguise it. It was
 dawn when he had finished. Jack called
 "Wake up lazy-bones! You'll pay for   
 this, silly old fool!" The giant was  
 very angry. He chased Jack out of his 
 catle and down the hill. His steps    
 were as loud as thunder. He fell in   
 the pit. Jack took his sword and cut  
 off the giant's head. Then he went    
 home with the giant's treasure.       </content>
