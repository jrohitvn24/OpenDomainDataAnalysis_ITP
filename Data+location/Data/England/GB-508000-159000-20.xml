		<title>20COMPANIES IN COBHAM SURREY</title>
		<content> Three companies, {Logica, the Wellcome
{Foundation and Sperry}, moved to      
 Cobham recently. They all said that   
 they chose Cobham for its good        
 communications: the M25, the rail     
 service, the A3 into London and its   
 location between Heathrow and Gatwick.
 Sperry and Wellcome do a large        
 proportion of their business abroad.  
 Sperry and Logica are both involved in
 computers; Wellcome is a              
 pharmaceutical company.               
 Logica moved into Cobham Park.        
 Wellcome plan to use the disused      
 Schiff Home of Recovery. Wellcome     
 chose this site, which is awaiting    
 Government approval, out of 100 sites 
 in the London area.                   
 Asked if they had any complaints about
 the area, they said it lacked good    
 lunch facilities and accommodation for
 single people.                        </content>
