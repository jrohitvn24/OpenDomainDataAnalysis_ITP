		<title>17Milking Time.</title>
		<content>  Every morning the farmer gets up at  
 6.00 a.m. so that he is ready to begin
 milking at 6.30 a.m.                  
  The cows are led, six at a time, into
 the milking parlour. The cows' udders 
 are washed and the clusters of the    
 milking machine are put on and they   
 start milking. After ten minutes they 
 stop and another six cows are sent in,
 until all 35 cows have been milked.   
 The udders are disinfected before the 
 gate is opened and the cows are sent  
 back into the yard, then out into the 
 field until 4.30 p.m. when they are   
 milked again.                         
  Meanwhile the milk is pumped through 
 pipes via a strainer sock to the bulk 
 tank where it is stored at an even,   
 cool temperature until the milk tanker
 comes to collect it and take it to    
 Stroud Creamery.
