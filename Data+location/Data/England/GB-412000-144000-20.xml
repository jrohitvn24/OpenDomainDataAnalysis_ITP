		<title>20WHY STOP THE HIPPIES?</title>
		<content>                                       
 THE HIPPIES ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE   
 WHO GO TO STONEHENGE EVERY YEAR FOR   
 THE SUMMER SOLSTICE ON JUNE 21ST,     
 WHICH IS WHEN THE SUN SHINES THROUGH  
 TWO GREAT STONES.FOR THE PAST ELEVEN  
 YEARS THEY HAVE BEEN ALLLOWED TO GO TO
 THE FAMOUS MONUMENT,BUT NOW, THIS     
 YEAR, 1985 THE POLICE ARE STOPPING    
 THEM BECAUSE THE PEOPLE IN CHARGE     
 DON'T WANT THE COUNTRYSIDE OR STONES  
 RUINED,BUT MAINLY DON'T WANT THE ABUSE
 OF DRUGS.THE HIPPIES ARE SWARMING     
 AROUND AMESBURY AND LARKHILL,NEARBY   
 TOWNS.POLICE HAVE SET UP ROADBLOCKS ON
 ROADS LEADING TO STONEHENGE BUT TOUR- 
 ISTS CAN VISIT.HIPPIES ARE CAMPING ON 
 LORD CARDIGAN'S LAND,HE WAS HORRIFIED 
 AT ACTION TO REMOVE THEM.PERHAPS THEY 
 WILL BE ABLE TO VISIT AFTER ALL;I     
 DON'T THINK THE POLICE HAVE THE RIGHT 
 TO STOP THEM,WHATEVER THE REASON.     </content>
