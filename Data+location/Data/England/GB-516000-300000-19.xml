		<title>19A SHOPPING STREET IN P'BORO.</title>
		<content>   Lincoln Road is a major road into   
 and out of the city and is surrounded 
 by residential areas. Its shops offer 
 a wide range of services. Generally   
 the shops are small and provide a     
 daily and weekly shopping facility.   
 Most of the shops were food shops or  
 shops that provided small household   
 goods. Small grocers, newsagents and  
 wine stores were common on both sides 
 of the street, while shops selling    
 household goods included a D.I.Y.     
 store, a furniture shop and a bicycle 
 store.                                
   There are  few restaurants along the
 road, mainly because most people who  
 are going to eat out do so in the city
 centre. Two cafes and three fish and  
 chip shops offered take away services.
 In between the small shops could be   
 found small offices.
