		<title>15The clothes we wear</title>
		<content>   In{winter,}on school days I normally
 wear{school uniform}which is a white  
 cotton blouse, a grey skirt, a red and
 blue striped tie and a school jumper  
 which is royal blue with Meadows      
 School embroidered on it in red.When  
 it snows I wear{wellington boots}which
 are made out of rubber or plastic so  
 they don't leak.Last winter the       
 fashion was{ankle boots.}We wear long 
 socks over the knee. Boys wear shirts 
 and trousers and jumpers.             
   In the summer I wear cotton dresses 
 or skirts and T-shirts.I wear ankle   
 socks and sandals which are a lot     
 cooler than shoes.                    
  {Kagoules}are wind and rain proof    
 coats made of nylon.Other coats keep  
 out other kinds of weather. Some      
 winter coats are lined with wool to   
 keep out the cold.
