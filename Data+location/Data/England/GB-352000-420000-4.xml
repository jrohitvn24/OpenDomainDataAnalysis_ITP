 The Festival procession and the       
 events on Worden Park have taken place
 in Leyland for many years.            
 The procession begins on Centurian Way
 in Farington and goes to Worden       
 Park.There are Morris dancers fancy   
 cars and trucks.                      
 The floats are from schools charity   
 groups and churches.There are children
 dressed up collecting money and I saw 
 a clown on stilts.Worden Park was full
 of different things like a fun fair   
 and lots of stalls,ice cream vans and 
 different displays.There was a display
 of parachuting,morris dancing,brass   
 bands,motorcycle displays and         
 fireworks.Lots of school children took
 part in the many varied events.The    
 purpose of the Festival is to raise   
 money for local charities.
