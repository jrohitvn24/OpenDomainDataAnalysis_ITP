		<title>19Dairy Farmer in the Wolfords</title>
		<content> My day starts between 4:30am and      
 5:30am depending on the time of year, 
 winter being the earlier start. During
 the winter months the next part of the
 day is always busy, looking to the    
 needs of the cows which are mostly    
 housed between November and April. In 
 the summer however, the middle part of
 the day is far more relaxed and there 
 is a chance to catch up on all the    
 extra jobs which tend to build up on  
 a dairy farm. I milk again in the     
 afternoon around 4pm and I'm usually  
 finished at about 7pm although the day
 does not always finish then. I        
 couldn't imagine myself doing any     
 other job and although much of dairy  
 farming is a chore, I find it a very  
 satisfying way of life.               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
