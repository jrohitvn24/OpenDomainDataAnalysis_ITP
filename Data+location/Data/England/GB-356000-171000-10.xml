		<title>10A Moslem Sunday in Bristol</title>
		<content> My mum usually wakes up in the morning
 about half past four or five to pray. 
 Then she goes back to sleep again.  We
 have to pray five times a day.  Then I
 wake up in the morning about 10 or 11 
 a.m. and when everyone else wakes up  
 my mum makes us some breakfast.  Then 
 my mum prays again at 2 p.m. and me   
 and my brother go to the park and come
 back at 4 p.m.  Then at about 5 p.m.  
 we pray again and we play with our    
 friend Mark.  We stop playing at about
 7.30 p.m. and go to pray in the Mosque
 and until the next time to pray we    
 read the Koran or we sometimes play   
 in the hall.  At 10 p.m. it is the    
 last time to pray.  When we finish    
 reading, we go home about 12 o'clock  
 and we go to sleep.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
