		<content> The old{tied cottage}system on farms  
 has almost disappeared. Few jobs now  
 have a house provided. The majority of
 houses are{owner occupied}&amp; maintained
 to a high standard. Central heating,  
 modern plumbing &amp; double glazing are  
 common.{Bungelows}are preferred by    
 people building new dwellings. The    
 brick &amp; tiling materials are brought  
 in from out of the County.{Rented     
 property is owned by the Local        
 District Council, many of the rents   
 for people on low incomes are         
 subsidised - rates too if occupants   
 have low income. Provision is made for
 6{retired couples}in a specially      
 built unit in Aby. Many of the farm   
 cottages have been renovated - there  
 are a few holdiay cottages. Planning  
 permission for new homes if given by  
{East Lindsey D.C.}only if within the  
 specified building areas.             </content>
