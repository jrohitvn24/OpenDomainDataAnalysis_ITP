		<content>   Pennyhill Park Hotel is an          
 established, exclusive hotel with many
 historic connections.It has on one of 
 the borders of its 112 acres a        
{holly hedge}which used to be the      
{longest in Britain,}but it has since  
 declined.                             
                                       
 The house itself is almost 100 years  
 old and so this provides considerable 
 intrigue.                             
                                       
 In the grounds are many sports        
 facilities including a swimming       
 pool,tennis courts and a 9 hole golf  
 course.                               
 The land used to be rich heathland on 
 which the local villagers built       
 hunting lodges.There is a legend that 
{Dick Turpin}and his men used to sit on
 one of the hills and look out for his 
 pursuers.                             </content>
