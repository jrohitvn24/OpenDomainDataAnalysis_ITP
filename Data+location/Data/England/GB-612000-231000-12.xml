		<title>12  Mistley Railway Bridge</title>
		<content>    During 1984 and 1985 British Rail  
 have re-built Mistley bridge so we    
 can have new high speed electric      
{trains}and improve rail{transport}to  
 Harwich.                              
    When the bridge was re-built first 
 the draughtsman drew the plans and    
 showed the manager. Then they had to  
 drill holes two feet deep along the   
 middle of the old bridge and knock    
 down half and leave the other half for
 people to cross. They re-built this   
 half then they knocked down the other 
 half and re-built that.               
    After this they had to tarmac the  
 road and re-build the pavement and    
 put pointed brick on the walls so     
 people dont walk on them.             
    The bridge altogether took one year
 to re-build and{British Rail}hope we  
 will have{electric trains}in 1986.
