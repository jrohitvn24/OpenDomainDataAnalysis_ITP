		<content>   This club is a form of entertainment
 and is held on a Tuesday night in     
 Gaitsgill Hall. Different activities  
 take place every week. Sometimes we go
 on visits to various organisations, or
 people come to the hall to give talks 
 and demonstrations.                   
                                       
   The senior members of the club often
 organise dances and discos. Every year
 there is an Annual General Meeting in 
 Bournemouth where all the clubs get   
 together for competitions. There is   
 also a field day with a dance at      
 night.                                
                                       
   We sometimes go ice_skating and     
 ten_pin bowling. Overall it is a      
 very friendly and enjoyable club.
