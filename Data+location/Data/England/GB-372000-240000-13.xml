		<content>  This was founded in approximately    
 1872 although it could go back even   
 further according to some documents   
 kept at Barton Court.                 
  It developed from a club which       
 fielded mainly schoolmasters and      
 clergymen to an organisation which    
 involves a good cross-section of rural
 people. Around a third of the members 
 come from the village whilst the rest 
 travel from the Malvern/Upton/Ledbury 
 area.                                 
  The club boasts one of the finest    
 village grounds in the country and is 
 well-known for its high standard of   
 play. In 1982 it reached the          
 quarter-finals of the National Village
 Championship and won the Beach Villas 
 Three Counties League. There are      
 around  45 regular playing members, as
 well as youth sides. The committee is 
 well-organised and effective.         </content>
