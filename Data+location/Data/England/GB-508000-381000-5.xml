		<title>05HOLTON:ATTITUDES.LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content> Most people in Holton would like to   
 see the village stay small.Various    
 schemes have been suggested to make   
 the area one of growth but as there is
 no industry and farming employs fewer 
 people there would be little demand   
 for housing.Holton was the centre of a
 community of pacifists during the war 
 and some of the older people here were
 part of that community and are still  
 farming here.It is sad to see the     
 disappearance of the hedgerows to make
 way for larger fields but trees are   
 being planted as copses.The young     
 children go to Wragby school by bus.  
 Older children cycle to school at     
 Market Rasen.The free bus to the      
 supermarket is well patronised so is  
 the weekly shopping bus to Lincoln,   
 although every household but 3 has at 
 least 1 car.                          
                                       </content>
