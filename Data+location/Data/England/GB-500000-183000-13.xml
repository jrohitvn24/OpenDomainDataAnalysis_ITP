		<content> Here are some of the games we play at 
 school....                            
 Rounders,Red letter,Queeni and Had.   
 My favourite game is Rounders.        
 Rounders is a game with 2 sides ,a    
 batting side and a bowling side.Each  
 side has a team captain and the team  
 captains choose people to be on their 
 team.Bowling chooses first,then       
 batting and so on.                    
 When the teams have been chosen the   
 batting team make a line opposite the 
 person out of the bowling team that   
 has been chosen to bowl.The rest of   
 the team spread themselves out around 
 the bowler.                           
 The bowler bowls the ball and the     
 batting captain hits it.There are 4   
 bases.If the person gets to 4th that  
 is 1 rounder
