		<content> One of the games that I like to play  
 is called Kerbie.All you need to play 
 Kerbie is a ball and 2 players.Kerbie 
 is a game that boys sometimes like to 
 play as well as girls.You need to play
 in a street with 2 kerbs opposite     
 each other.1 player stands at 1 side  
 of the road and the other player at   
 the other side of the road. The one   
 that goes first throws the ball and   
 tries to get it to hit the kerb and   
 come back to them then if it does come
 back to them then they have to go into
 the middle and have another throw of  
 the ball and if it comes back again   
 you have to move further back and have
 another go until you miss.You end one 
 game when someone gets 10 goals.Kerbie
 is a game usually played by 2         
 children.   K.DUNN AGE 10
