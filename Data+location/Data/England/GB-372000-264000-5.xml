		<title>05GAME - KICK-THE-CAN</title>
		<content> KICK-THE-CAN                          
 Kick-the-can is a game where everyone 
 except one person hides. That person  
 hides his eyes and counts to a number 
 decided before he started counting.   
 Then he looks around and tries to find
 the others.When anyone wants to try to
 run to base where he hid his eyes     
 (called the can) they may do so. If he
 sees them running to the can, he can  
 run, and they try to beat each other  
 to the can. If the person who hid his 
 eyes wins, he shouts,  "Kick-the can" 
 and the person's name.But if the      
 person who hid beats the person who is
 on then he shouts,"Kick-the-can save  
 myself".At the end the first person   
 caught is on next, unless the last    
 person saves all.To save all instead  
 of saying"Kick-the-can save myself"   
 you say "Kick-the-can save all" and   
 the person who is on counts again.    </content>
