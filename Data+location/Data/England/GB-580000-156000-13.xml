		<title>13FRININGHAM FARM DETLING</title>
		<content> The farm is run as a family concern by
 the farmer and his wife. One full time
 worker is employed but other labourers
 are employed, in season on a casual   
 basis. The farm is a mixed farm,      
 having sheep, cattle and poultry,     
 together with crops, the main ones    
 being wheat, barley and oilseed rape. 
 Yields over the last 5 years:-        
 Wheat - 3 tons per acre               
 Barley - 2.5 tons per acre            
 Rape Seed - 1.25 tons per acre        
 Peas are also grown for freezing.     
 Machinery includes a 4-wheel drive    
 tractor, 100 H.P. worth Â£20000 and a  
 combine harvester worth Â£45000.       
 A good bullock could be sold at Â£1 per
 kilo (live weight) and there is a     
 subsidy of 8p per kilo. A 4 month old 
 lamb (dead weight 18 kilo) would be   
 worth Â£35.
