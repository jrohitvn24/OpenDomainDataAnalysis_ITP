		<title>14A DAY AT SCHOOL- Gina Davies</title>
		<content>At school I jotted things in my diary. 
In the assembly at 9:05 a story was    
read out by Mrs Poole our head teacher.
 After that we did some work for the   
next school we go to.I had to write a  
poem in my neatest writing and do some 
art and write a story.For my art I     
did  a rabbit putting it's paws on a   
hedgehog's shoulder.                   
 At school my brother did some sewing  
and he finished his tortoise he was    
making so he brought it home.For       
homework he had Maths and Reading.     
 My sister Natalie got to school at    
8:45 and had reading for homework.     
                                       
(When this was written,Gina was a top  
Junior,Christopher was a first-year    
Junior and Natalie was first-year      
Infants.)
