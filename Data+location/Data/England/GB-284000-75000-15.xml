		<content> Watts Blake &amp; Bearnes clay company was
 founded in 1860 although clay has been
 mined in the area from Roman times.   
 The clay seam is found in a line      
 through the Bovey basin which         
 is about 10 miles long &amp; 3 miles wide.
                                       
                                       
        Opencast Quarrying             
       {____________________           
    The opencast quarry workings are   
 sited on the outcrops of the clay     
 surroundings of the Bovey Tracey      
 basin.Extraction is done in two ways  
 either by hand or mechanical          
 digging. Open cast working is         
 preferable to underground methods due 
 to economic considerations.The exposed
 clay is won mechanically by means of  
 hydraulic excavators, loaded into     
 dumpers and transported to the storage
 bays.                                 </content>
