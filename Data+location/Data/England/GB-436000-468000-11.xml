		<title>11St Helen's Chapel Skelton</title>
		<content> St Helen's Chapel.is made out of      
 stone. it was built in the 18th       
 century to replace an older building  
 on the same site which used to stand  
 out into the road. There is a very    
 nice Lych Gate. The windows are broken
 in the chapel. it is still open but is
 not used for Church Services any      
 more. it is hoped that it will be     
 repaired and a new use found for it.  
 Some pupils from Boroughbridge High   
 School have been making a plan of the 
 gravestones so that they may be moved 
 to enable the grass to be cut         
 by machine.
