		<title>12FARM(cont), THE COWDRAY ARMS</title>
		<content> All the cows on the farm are Freisan  
 cows and are black and white. They    
 take the calves and bottle feed them  
 so the dairy farmer can have the cows 
 milk .The milk is kept in a big tank  
 and they have a reserve tank just in  
 case there is too much milk to go in  
 one tank.                             
{THE COWDRAY ARMS                      
 They have about 25 workers, some      
 students who do just a few hours a    
 week. The licensee and his wife have  
 some weekends off and get only 2 weeks
 holiday a year. When they are away    
 they have stand ins to keep the place 
 open. They often work an 18 hour      
 day.As the pub is on a busy road, with
 very few homes nearby, most of their  
 customers are people passing by.They  
 do not have many regular customers.   
 The nearest pub is in Balcombe about 2
 miles away.                           </content>
