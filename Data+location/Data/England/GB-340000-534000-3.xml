		<content> The area has an interesting variety of
 wild flowers, birds and animals and a 
 public interest in their welfare. A   
 system of footpaths radiates from     
 Skelton across the farmland.          
 Much conservation work has been done  
 eg. the ponds near Roadends Wood and  
 the school grounds, tree planting in  
 Braisgate, at Ellonby, in the hedge-  
 rows and around the school. In        
 contrast the occasional hedgerow is   
 lost under the farmer's plough.       
 The climate is healthy and varied with
 winter midday temperature of 4c rising
 to 17c in summer. Skelton is generally
 known for its cool strong winds.      
 Snowdrifts may cut off the villages in
 winter whilst heatwaves MAY occur in  
 the summer.
