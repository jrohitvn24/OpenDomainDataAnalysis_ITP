		<title>02Where People Work</title>
		<content>   Being a rural area many people still
 find employment on the land,farming   
 and market gardening. A few families  
 earn their living from fishing and the
 processing of the catch.              
   There are quite a few people, based 
 in the area who are plumbers,builders,
 joiners and decorators.This work means
 that they may have to travel to other 
 villages and nearby towns.            
   Tourism is very important in summer,
 there is a large Caravan site close to
 Flookburgh which employs local people 
 in the season.A number of houses offer
 Bed and Breakfast.                    
   Nurseries and Market gardens employ 
 up to 50 at peak times, with a similar
 number in shops and small businesses. 
   Many people now work for large firms
 in the area...Vickers Shipyard, Glaxo 
 Chemicals, British Gas and Oxleys (Hi-
 tech).                                </content>
