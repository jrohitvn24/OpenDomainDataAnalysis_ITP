		<title>16THE TROUT LAKE-CHESTERTON</title>
		<content> The landowner owns about 1000 acres.He
 does lots towards conservation.He had 
 the idea of making a trout lake       
 because he thought it was a lovely    
 place.The lake is 12 acres in size.   
 They do not buy fish because they     
 breed them.The fishermen have a       
 competition to see who can catch the  
 heaviest fish.The winner gets a bottle
 of whiskey.They get their fish food   
 from suppliers.No-one has any idea how
 many fish there are in the lake.The   
 copse is 18 acres in size.It has lots 
 of insects and animals.The trees      
 included in the copse are Firs,Willows
 and Oaks.The disused water mill is    
 thought to be haunted and there are no
 plans to restart it.
