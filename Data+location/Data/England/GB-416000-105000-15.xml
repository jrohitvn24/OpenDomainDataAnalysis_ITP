		<content>   Mrs.Errington is upset by the{litter
{problem}in{Ringwood}and worried by the
 slow progress in sorting out the{     
{traffic}(chaos every Wednesday,{market
{day.}) Very upsetting is the          
 continuing occurrence of dreadful car 
 accidents at{Picket Post}where        
 westbound traffic hits cars emerging  
 from the{Burley}road.                 
   Councillor Mrs. Errington likes     
 District Council work more than County
 Council; she is not paid but receives 
 an "attendance allowance".            
   Recently, Mrs. Errington's brother,{
{Philip Ziegler,}published the official
 biography of{Lord Louis Mountbatten,} 
 but she did not give us her opinion of
 the book as she hasn't finished       
 reading it yet.                       
   Finally, Mrs.Errington said she     
 hoped to see our school, Ringwood     
 County Junior, modernised soon!       </content>
