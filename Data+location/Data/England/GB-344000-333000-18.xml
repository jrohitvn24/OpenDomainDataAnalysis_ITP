		<content> OUTSIDE LYNEAL SCHOOL by Helen        
 Marshall(a piece of writing done in   
 school)                               
                                       
 "With a great deal of pushing and     
 shoving,we all pulled our coats and   
 wellies on and raced out to the       
 playground.                           
 It was a sunny,mild day with a slight 
 breeze drifting along from a westerly 
 direction.                            
 Looking across to Colemere, the sky   
 was hazy with a tint of purple in it. 
 You could make out the mound of the   
 sand and gravel pit.                  
 The hollow echoes of feet on a wooden 
 classroom floor mingled with a plane  
 humming like a sucking vacuum cleaner.
 Birds were cawing as we moved off down
 to the village."
