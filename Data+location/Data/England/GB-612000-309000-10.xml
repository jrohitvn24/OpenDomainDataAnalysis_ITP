		<title>10Easton Village Life CONT</title>
		<content>  Easton has{two main landowners,}one  
 who lives at{West Lodge,}which is     
 along Low Rd. The other lives at      
{Easton Lodge.}Both landowners were    
 very fortunate to have their own{water
{well,}the water in which we believe   
 came from the Pennines.               
                                       
  On the{2nd of January 1976,}gales hit
 Norfolk sweeping both young and old   
 trees down. It was so bad that the    
{forestry commission,}who monitor the  
 trees throughout the country made a   
 report on the very old trees that were
 blown down.
