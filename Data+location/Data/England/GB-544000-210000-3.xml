{Father Francis Burgess},a Roman       
 Catholic priest for 55 years ,moved   
 from Epping to{Harlow}in 1952 .When he
 first came to his parish there was    
 only one house called Moot House ,now 
 a community centre in the middle of   
 the{Stow},a busy shopping centre .    
  Only twelve people attended his first
 service but because he knew Harlow    
 was going to become a big new town ,  
 he started building a church ,called {
{Our Lady of Fatima}.Built in 1960, it 
 took 18 months to complete.The cross  
 on top of the 80 foot steeple was     
 kissed by the children of{St.Alban's  
{school}before it was erected by crane.
  Fatima Church ,designed by{Gerald    
{Goalem},has spectacular stained glass 
 windows which were made by monks of{  
{Buckfast Abbey}.Inside is a terracotta
 statue of Christ the King .           </content>
