		<content> Terrington St Clement is the largest  
 parish in Norfolk, although due to its
 situation it is relatively sparsely   
 populated and still a village which   
 has no well defined pattern.          
 A considerable area of the parish has 
 been reclaimed from the Wash over the 
 centuries and the succession of banks 
 shows the progress of this work.      
 The predominant occupations are       
 agriculture and horticulture on the   
 very fertile land, these producing    
 potatoes corn and sugarbeet, and salad
 vegetables and fruit. The village     
 contains the site of one of the       
 national experimental husbandry farms.
  There are now a number of small local
 industries and two nationally known   
 ones are Tony Clements African Violets
 and Tony Hodgsons Wrough Ironworks.
