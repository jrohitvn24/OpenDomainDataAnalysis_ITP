		<content> In our square we have four plantations
 and two coppices.                     
  Timber is grown to be used for lots  
 of things like houses, furniture,     
 boxes, wagons, road vehicles,         
 telegraph poles, railway sleepers,    
 farm garden or shipyard fencing.      
  Wood is used for other purposes, tool
 making, toy making, brush making, and 
 the bare bones of musical instruments.
  Our newspapers are made from pulp    
 which starts of as wood. Lots of paper
 items are made from wood-pulp, such as
 paper, writing paper, and newspaper.  
  Trees grown in these plantations are 
 mostly Douglas_Fir, Scots pine, and   
 Spruce.                               
  Some plantations are owned by the    
 forestry commision, a government      
 organization, and some are privately  
 owned.
