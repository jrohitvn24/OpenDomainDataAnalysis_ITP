		<title>02FIRST RUDDINGTON CHURCH</title>
		<content>{FLAWFORTH CHURCH                      
  There was a Roman Villa at this      
 crossroads of footpaths and then a    
 church was built for the four         
 villages.{RUDDINGTON, EDWALTON,       
{PLUMTREE AND BRADMORE.                
{RUDDINGTON}had a chapel built in the  
 village in 1479 and then only burials 
 were held at {FLAWFORTH.}There is a   
 funny shaped bush called the Resting  
 Bush on {FLAWFORTH LANE}which was     
 shaped by the coffins resting on it.  
 In 1773 the disused church spire fell 
 down and the church was dismantled.   
 Many of the stones were used by       
 villages for building.                
  Now all that is left are a few       
 gravestones but it has been           
 Archaelogicaly surveyed and will show 
 the outlines of the church and villa  
 when the work is finished.
