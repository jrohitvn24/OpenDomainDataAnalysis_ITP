		<title>12GAMES AT FAIR OAK SCHOOL</title>
		<content>    These are some of the games we play
 at School.                            
   {French Skipping.}For this you get a
 piece of elastic about two metres long
 and join the ends. Two people stand   
 facing each other with the elastic    
 round their ankles or knees. Someone  
 stands in the centre and jumps over   
 the elastic according to instructions.
 When you say "on" you jump on the     
 elastic; "inside" and "out" are other 
 calls. If you make a mistake you are  
 out. The height of the elastic is     
 raised each time and all the time you 
 chant-"Granny put her knickers on     
 inside out".                          
   {Jew Rush.}To play thi game you need
 a powerball. The person who is "it"   
 throws the ball over the playground   
 and the others have to run for it. You
 have to get the ball as many times as 
 there are people playing to win.      </content>
