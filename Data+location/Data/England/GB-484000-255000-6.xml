		<title>06  Don`s Store</title>
		<content>The building which is used for the     
store was built in the c17. Before 1951
it was used as a butchers shop,but had 
been empty for some years when Don     
Elderton took it over.In 1968,Don's    
store also became the village Post     
Office.Don is busiest just before      
Christmas.The old people like shopping 
at Don's because he is friendly,and he 
will deliver orders.Don says,that his  
best selling line is cigarettes.Don has
lived in the village all his life, and 
he enjoys the peace and quiet of the   
village The last real holiday Don had  
was  some years ago when he went away  
for a long weekend He has been broken  
into once,when the safe was cut away   
from the wall.Don has some of his      
stock delivered,but otherwise he has   
to collect it himself from the Cash    
and Carry. The village also has a Coop 
store just across the road             </content>
