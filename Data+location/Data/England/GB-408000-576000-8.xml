		<content>   The main feature of our area is     
{farming.                              
   There are approximately{7 farm      
{steadings,}all previously owned by the
 Middleton family. However today 4 are 
 owner-occupied. These farms lie to the
 south west of the Castle and Hall.    
   The emphasis is on{stock rearing and
{sheep farming}with arable crops       
 becoming more important in recent     
 years.                                
   The local farmers sell their stock  
 at{Scots Gap and Ponteland Marts,}but 
 often go a little further away to{    
{Hexham.}Breeding stock is bought from 
 larger markets in the{Borders and     
{Scotland,}or in the{south of England  
 and in later years from{France and    
{Belgium.}Limousin and Charolais cross 
 beast are more prominent than the more
 traditional Hereford.
