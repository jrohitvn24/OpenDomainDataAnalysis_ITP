		<content>   This 12 sq.km. area lies east of    
 Biggleswade encompssing the commuter  
 village of Dunton. Present day Dunton 
 has developed around a 12th century   
 agricultural base and church. It      
 consists mainly of new residential    
 developments. Land use throughout the 
 area is dominated by arable farming.  
 There are five farms in the area each 
 averaging 200 acres.                  
   The area includes the most southerly
 fringe of Biggleswade which is        
 composed of an industrial estate and  
 residential housing. Several schools  
 are within the area, one being a      
 special school for less academically  
 able children. There is also a        
 hospital of late Victorian age present
 in the north of the area.
