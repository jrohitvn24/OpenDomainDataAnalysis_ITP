		<content> The British Telecom (once Post Office)
 Tower in the NW corner of this block  
 provides a landmark for central London
 to the N of Oxford Circus.  Oxford    
 Street, the home of a branch of every 
 British fashion chain store, remains  
 constantly busy all year drawing      
 customers from abroad, other parts of 
 Britain and the 1000s of offices in   
 the West End.  The British Museum to  
 the E of this block, houses treasures 
 from around the world, including the  
 Parthanon friezes which the Greek     
 government would like to have returned
 to their country of origin.  Not only 
 does this area contain 100s of shops  
 but also restaurants--238 in fact were
 counted by the schoolchildren of All  
 Souls Primary in Foley Street--as well
 as 26 banks and 23 betting shops.     
 Foyles Book Shop near Tottenham Ct Rd 
 claims to be the largest in the world.</content>
