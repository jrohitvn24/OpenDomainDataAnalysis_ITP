		<title>12HOUSING</title>
		<content>   The houses are mainly               
 semi-detatched. These houses are built
 of red brick which have been blackened
 by the smoke from the coal fires      
 inside the houses.                    
   The new area is divided by the main 
 road.                                 
   There is one row of houses,         
 including the shops on the main road, 
 but behind these is a big estate of   
 semi-detatched council houses and     
 old-aged pensioners' bungalows. There 
 are quite a few houses on this estate,
 but it is not the only fairly new     
 estate in the village. There is       
 another one further up the road       
 consisting of bungalows and houses.   
 There is another similar estate on    
 the opposite side of the road, but    
 this is much smaller than the others. 
 All the houses are fairly new compared
 to the pit houses.                    </content>
