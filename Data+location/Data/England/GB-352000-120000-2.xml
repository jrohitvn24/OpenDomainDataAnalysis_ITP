		<title>02An archaeological dig</title>
		<content>   This summer a{dig}was organised by  
 Birmingham University behind{Castle   
{Farm.}Five grey caravans plus some    
 brightly coloured tents housed the    
 archaeologists.                       
   A{dozen trenches}soon appeared.Most 
 of the digging was{pick, shovel and   
{mattock}work,with a plasterer's trowel
 used to clean up the trench and reveal
 the various layers, each of which was 
 carefully labelled and numbered.      
   Supervisors with thick{site files   
 peered at the layers making detailed  
 notes and discussing the significance 
 of each emerging feature.             
   By each trench was a tray which     
 filled with{pottery fragments}and     
 motley{animal bones}as the day        
 proceeded, to be taken away for       
 washing by volunteer helpers who      
 included many interested children.    
 These finds helped to date the layers.</content>
