		<content> The River Yeo flows through the major 
 part of this area,below the 15 metre  
 contour line.This land is known as the
 moors or crouds.It is criss-crossed by
 drainage ditches known as rhynes.     
 Access is by wide pathways called     
 droves. The area is used for grazing  
 cattle and sheep, and is cropped for  
 silage and hay. 18th century Dutch    
 drainage work made the moors          
 accessable. Modern drainage and       
 levelling has enabled cattle farming  
 to be supplemented by sheep and cereal
 farming. There are 3 settlements:-    
 Long Sutton, Long Load, Muchelney Ham.
 Long Sutton and Long Load are ribbon  
 developments tracing the edge of the  
 moors and carriage routes. Muchelney  
 Ham is an agricultural site. Long     
 Sutton was used by the Romans as an   
 agricultural and military station.
