		<title>04MY SUNDAY.</title>
		<content> I woke up, looked out of the window   
 and saw that it was raining.  I got   
 washed and dressed and went downstairs
 for a breakfast of toast and a drink  
 of milk.  I woke my brother and, when 
 we were all ready, we got in the car  
 and set off for Grandma's. On arrival,
 my brother and I played with my cousin
 and then I had a game of tennis with  
 my dad. I won. My brother, cousin and 
 I made a den in the trees and bushes. 
 We put planks in the trees and an old 
 door in the bushes. I looked at my    
 cousin and saw that her pink dress and
 white belt were black, so we quickly  
 went in for tea. For our tea we had   
 roast beef, carrots, roast potatoes   
 and gravy followed by a pudding. My   
 Grandma is a very good cook. We got in
 the car and drove home in the dark on 
 the motorway. We had baths and went to
 bed. I read awhile then went to sleep.</content>
