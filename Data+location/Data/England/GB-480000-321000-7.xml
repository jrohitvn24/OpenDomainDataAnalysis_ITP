		<title>07GARTHORPE RACECOURSE.</title>
		<content> The main part of this racecourse is   
 situated in the south-east corner of  
 the area, although the course itself  
 extends out of the area. This         
 privately owned racecourse (Mrs Newton
 being the present owner) is used by   
 all the local hunts, including the    
 Belvoir and the Quorn, for point-to-  
 point racing. Much of the course is   
 over the surrounding farmland.        
 The racecourse is also the site of the
 annual Pony Club camp. The week long  
 camp attracts young riders from the   
 surrounding area who wish to improve  
 their equestrian skills by taking part
 in the various classes which are      
 arranged throughout the week.
