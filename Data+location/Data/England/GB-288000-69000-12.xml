		<content> Sport is quite popular nowdays.       
 There is a cricket team in            
 Combeinteignhead and a riding school  
 in Stokeinteignhead. There is a youth 
 football team which has to play       
 all away matches because there is     
 not a field in the village. There used
 to be a Bowling team. They played     
 on a green which was turned into the  
 pub carpark. There is a youth club on 
 Mondays from 7.00 until 9.00. The     
 Youth club organizes rounders, various
 sports both indoors and outdoors and  
 once a month a disco. The primary     
 school has a learner swimming pool but
 in the winter the children are taken  
 to Torquay to swim. The nearest sports
 centres to the villages are in        
 Paignton (Clennon Valley) and Newton  
 Abbot (Dyrons). There is no village   
 sports field principally because there
 is nowhere flat or suitable.          </content>
