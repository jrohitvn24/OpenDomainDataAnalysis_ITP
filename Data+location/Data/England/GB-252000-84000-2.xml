		<title>02Dartmoor Inn to Brat Tor</title>
		<content>   Just to the north of the {Dartmoor  
{Inn }there is a rough track just      
 negotiable by a motor vehicle.        
 Following this track one soon comes to
 the top of {High Down } and can look  
 down on the {River Lydd, }and up at   
{Brat Tor}towering above. To the north 
 of Brat Tor is Arms Tor, but one      
 cannot miss Brat Tor, since it is     
 crowned with a large cross called     
{Widgery Cross.                        
   One can cross the Lydd either by the
 stepping stones or on the wooden      
 bridge, and start the ascent up the   
 rocky sides of Brat Tor. This is a    
 pull up, and one needs good boots,    
 especially since most of the boulders 
 are covered by Wortleberry. The top of
 the tor is a classic tor, a pile of   
 granite surmounted by the cross. From 
 the top a fine view of Devon is       
 obtained.                             </content>
