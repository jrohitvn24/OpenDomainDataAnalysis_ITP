		<content> The  majority of people own their     
 homes, and are very conscious of      
 burglary, but prefer dogs and         
 "multiple" locks to alarm systems.    
 Most gardens are used mainly, or      
 entirely, for decorative purposes.    
 There are no new building             
 developments. The houses are mostly   
 pre_1939 and do not have              
 double_glazing and cavity_wall        
 insulation. Most houses do have inside
 toilets, bathroom, refridgerator,     
 central heating,garage, telephone and 
 loft insulation. Most of the houses   
 are semi_detatched. Most council      
 tenants think that the houses are     
 adequately maintained, especially     
 externally. The average number of     
 rooms per house is seven. Few private 
 landlords operate in the area.
