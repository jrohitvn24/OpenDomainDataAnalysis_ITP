		<title>02HAMPSTEAD GARDEN SUBURB</title>
		<content> The{Garden Suburb}was devised by{Dame 
{Henrietta Barnett}in 1907, two of the 
 architects were{Lutyens}and{Unwin. }  
 The idea of it was to have people     
 rich and poor, all living together in 
 one place.That's why the houses are of
 different sizes. Dame Henrietta wanted
 the Suburb to have a{countryside      
{atmosphere,}so the houses are like    
 cottages and there are many different 
 designs. When it was built each house 
 had two fruit trees in the garden.    
  The{Suburb}has changed since 1907.The
 place became so popular that lots of  
 people wanted to move in and prices   
 went up.Now most people who live in   
 the Garden Suburb are quite{wealthy.} 
  If you want to build an extension or 
 something that changes the look of    
 your house you have to ask permission 
 from the {Garden Suburb Trust,}so that
 it will still look basically the same.</content>
