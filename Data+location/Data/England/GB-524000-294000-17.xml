		<title>17Recreation in Whittlesey</title>
		<content>   The general picture was that people 
 lived in Whittlesey but often went out
 -side the town for their entertainment
 and recreation.                       
   The town has one large park with an 
 open-air swimming pool, sports hall   
 and football pitches.  The pool is    
 open in the summer months and is solar
 heated. Several smaller parks and     
 playing fields are around the town.   
   The parks are mostly used by younger
 children.  The teenagers can go to one
 of two clubs or join any of the youth 
 organisations represented in the town.
   Whittlesey has many good pubs some  
 of which serve hot food.              
   The nearest cinemas, theatre, discos
 indoor swimming pool and football team
 are in Peterborough and a large       
 percentage of the people of Whittlesey
 go there to use them on a fairly      
 regular basis.                        </content>
