		<title>04Two Farms (2)Norton Grange</title>
		<content> In common with most farmers in the    
 area Mr.F.Palmer of Norton Grange Farm
 rents his land from the Welbeck       
 Estate Co.which also owns most of the 
 dwellings in and around the villages  
 of Norton and Cuckney.While many of   
 the surrounding farms are solely      
 arable, Norton Grange has beef cattle 
 as well as goats and poultry.         
 Like many other local farmers' wives  
 Mrs.Palmer welcomes Bed and Breakfast 
 guests.These are usually tourists who 
 use the Cuckney area as a stop-over   
 point in their travels around the     
 wider area.Popular tourist spots are  
{Creswell Crags},{The Peak District    
{National Park},{Sherwood Forest},{    
{Chatsworth House}and the other stately
 homes in the area nearby known as {The
{Dukeries.}
