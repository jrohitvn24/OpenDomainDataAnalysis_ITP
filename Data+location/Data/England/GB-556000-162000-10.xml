		<content>{Brands Hatch Place}lies just half a   
 mile from the east entrance to Brands 
 Hatch.  Bought to be run as a{hotel   
 some{ten years ago,}its growth and    
 development have been somewhat        
 unusual.                              
                                       
 It is not a hotel but a{country club. 
 This is due to some quirk of the      
{licencing laws.}The{Georgian house,   
 built in 1806 for the Duke of Norfolk,
 has been restored to its former       
 glory, with a delightful{conservatory.
 At Grand Prix times it is overflowing.
                                       
 As an adjunct of the country club, a  
 separate{health and fitness centre}has
 been built in the old stable block,   
 offering swimming, squash, sauna,     
 solarium, jacuzzi, gymnasium and      
 snooker.{Local membership}is available
 for{Â£120 per person per annum.        </content>
