		<title>19LIFE IN DUNHAMPSTEAD.</title>
		<content>  {Dunhampstead}is a small village     
 with two houses,one 0f which is of    
 historical interest,a public house,   
 a canal boat hiring centre,a souvenir 
 shop and a level crossing.            
  In the winter it is a quiet place    
 with little to do,especially for the  
 younger generation.In the summer there
 are a lot of tourists,who moor        
 there.They may just stop for          
 refreshments at{The Forge Studio}or   
 they may go for a snack /restaurant   
 meal at the{Firs Inn.}Here many       
 teenagers are employed as part time   
 staff.At the level crossing there is a
 small building from where the gates   
 are operated.                         
  In our view older people would       
 appreciate this area more because they
 enjoy the quietness of the countryside
 which Dunhampstead has to offer.
