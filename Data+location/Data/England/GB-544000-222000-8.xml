		<title>08WILDLIFE AT HADHAM HALL</title>
		<content>    The children at the school provide 
 an abundance of food for wild birds in
 the form of discarded food packets. As
 a result there a large numbers of     
 Rooks, Starlings, Thrushes and        
 especially Sparrows. Many of these    
 nest in buildings on the estate       
 although the Rooks come from a nearby 
 copse.                                
    The three ponds, formerly the moat,
 also encourage birdlife in the form of
 Coots, Moorhens and several Ducks.    
 These nest on the ponds and produce a 
 number of chicks each year. The ponds 
 are also stocked with a variety of    
 fish, especially Carp.                
    There are a number of reptiles     
 including Frogs and Toads a number of 
 which have to be rescued from the     
 Swimming Pool in the summer. On the   
 playing fields there a number of      
 Rabbits. Based on a survey by 1H.     </content>
