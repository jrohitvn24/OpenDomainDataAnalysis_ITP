		<title>12LICHFIELD CRICKET FIELD.</title>
		<content>  Lichfield Cricket Field is adjacent  
to Victoria Hospital and is owned      
by the St.John's Trust. In the         
pavilion hangs a copy of the Club's    
first rules dated 1846 when the        
Annual Subscription was #1.            
  In 1969 the Club merged with the     
Lichfield Hockey Club and the club-    
house is also used by the Air Gun      
Club, the Pigeon Club and a darts      
league.                                
  A popular annual event is the        
Chauntry Cup but the main event of 1984
was the Lords Taverners versus Lord    
Lichfields's 11 when 5,000 people      
attended. As part of the Dr.Johnson's  
Centenary Year celebrations, also in   
1984, Lichfield 11 versus an Invitation
11 played in traditional dress, top    
hats, white trousers, waistcoats etc.  
  In recent years the ground has been  
chosen as a minor counties venue.      </content>
