		<content> A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A WORKING PARENT 
 My dad works at Tilcon.  He gets up at
 5 a.m. then sets out for work at 6    
 a.m.  He goes to the depot to collect 
 his lorry and spends all day          
 delivering sand.  He has his lunch    
 when he can.  He comes home at 4.p.m. 
 After tea he goes to sleep in the     
 chair.  He plays dominoes in the club 
 at night.  He works six days a week   
 and most week-ends, but he likes his  
 job.                                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
