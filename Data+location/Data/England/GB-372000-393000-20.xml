		<title>20FLIXTON'S GOLF COURSE</title>
		<content> I play golf at William Rowe Municipal 
 Golf Course. I'm not very good as I've
 only been playing for four or five    
 months, but I've already met most of  
 the characters who play there.        
  I often play with my Dad or two of my
 mates. My Dad is away a lot with the  
 Navy and so has Four weeks of non-stop
 golf and four without any. He's the   
 sort who hates playing in bad weather.
 He gets really mad with himself when  
 he makes an error or gets a bad score.
 He usually blames it on his wood,     
 which is the club he tees off with. I 
 like this because when he played      
 really badly a few weeks ago, he sold 
 me his wood for a fiver! Then there's 
 Mark and Darren. Mark must be really  
 cool and patient, Because when he     
 makes a mistake he just grunts. When  
 Darren or I make mistakes though, the 
 course is no place for a vicar.       </content>
