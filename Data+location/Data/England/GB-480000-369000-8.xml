		<title>08Shopping in South Clifton</title>
		<content> There is one small village shop in    
 South Clifton and one in Marnham.These
 are used mostly for odd items needed  
 in emergency or children requiring    
 sweets.A mobile shop from the nearby  
 village of Newton on Trent comes round
 once a week as does a Butcher's       
 van.Most families do their main       
 shopping in either Lincoln,Newark or  
 Gainsborough which are all roughly 12 
 miles away.There are large superstores
 at these centres providing cheaper    
 goods along with the Asda superstore  
 at North Hykeham.The family visits    
 these centres once a week on a Friday 
 evening or a Saturday.Others visit the
 large open air Market at Newark on a  
 Wednesday or Saturday.There is one bus
 a week on a Wednesday to and from     
 Newark for people without             
 transport,otherwise they must rely on 
 the goodwill of neighbours for a lift.</content>
