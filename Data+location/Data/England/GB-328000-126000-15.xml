		<title>15THE RECTOR OF DURSTON</title>
		<content>  The rector of Durston looks after    
 four churches in three parishes.He is 
 the vicar of North Newton and the     
 rector of Durston,Thurloxton and      
 Michaelchurch.He takes services at    
 three different churches on a Sunday  
 morning and one evening service.On the
 fifth Sunday in a month there is one  
 joint service for all three parishes. 
  Other work he does in the parishes   
 includes,visiting the sick,leading    
 confirmation classes,taking assembly  
 in the primary school,form filling for
 the diocese and interpreting Church   
 regulations. The last two have become 
 very time consuming.This worries the  
 rector as he feels it is deterring    
 young men from entering the Church.   
  Before becoming ordained,the rector  
 was in the R.A.F.for 16 years.He then 
 entered the Church and became an      
 R.A.F.chaplain.                       </content>
