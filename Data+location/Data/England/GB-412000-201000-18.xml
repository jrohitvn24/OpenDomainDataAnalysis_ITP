		<title>18FAIRFORD PEACE GROUP</title>
		<content>   In May l984, a number of people who 
 were worried about the threat of a    
 nuclear world catastrophe formed a    
 town{peace group.} Its members sought 
 to arouse public concern by means of  
 lectures, films, demonstrations and   
 vigils.  A peace picnic alternative to
 the International Air Tattoo was      
 organised.  National CND activities   
 were supported.   There was also      
 protest against increased militarism  
 in the town caused by the developing  
 presence of the USAF with its noisy   
 strato-tankers, alarms in the night,  
 bugle call reveilles, etc.  All this  
 was seen as an unnecessary violation  
 of the peace of a pleasant Cotswold   
 town.  Was the country really being   
 threatened?  What was to be the ending
 of it all?  By September l985 the     
 group had a membership of about 5O    
 from varied walks of life.            </content>
