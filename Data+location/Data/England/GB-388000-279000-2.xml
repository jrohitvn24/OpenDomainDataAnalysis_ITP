		<title>021086 DOMESDAY SURVEY</title>
		<content>  Hagley was first mentioned in writing
 in the{Domesday survey}of 1086,when it
 was known as Hageleia.Its lord was    
{Willhemus (Fitz Ansculfi),}whose      
 sub-tenant was the local knight,      
 Roger. The inhabitants mentioned      
 were 5 villeins,10 bordars, and 1     
 priest.                               
  The next significant mention of      
 Hagley comes in the{Lay Subsidy Roll  
 of 1327.This survey of Haggeleye is   
 not a complete list of all            
 inhabitants, but 12 residents are     
 mentioned, including Edmundo, lord of 
 the manor.                            
  Hagley's{parish records}contain      
 registers of baptisms, marriages, and 
 burials dating back to 1538. From     
 these details, some conclusions can be
 drawn about the nature of Hagley      
 society in the late 16th and 17th     
 centuries.                            </content>
