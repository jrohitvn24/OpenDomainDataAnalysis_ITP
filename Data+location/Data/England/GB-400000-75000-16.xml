		<title>16Looking at Birds</title>
		<content>      Walking around the study area,   
 visitors see many different types of  
 bird, ranging from the more common    
 chaffinch to the migrating swallow.   
      Walking from Durlston on the     
 coastal footpath, brings you to a     
 special birdwatch sight where you can 
 observe fulmars, shags, kittiwakes,   
 herring gulls, razorbills, guillemots,
 and many other birds. Some have       
 nesting colonies along these cliffs,  
 others just visit them each day.      
 Further west puffins have their nests.
      Many groups of migrating birds   
 can be identified here, some arriving 
 from distant lands, others leaving our
 shores, some just passing through!
