		<content> The number of people living in the    
 area has increased steadily since 1920
 when the then Earl of Abingdon sold   
 his estate and many farms, homes and  
 land became privately owned. Cumnor,  
 Farmoor and Dean Court have become    
 dormitories for people working in     
 Oxford and elsewhere. There is a high 
 proportion of professional and        
 administrative people connected with  
 the University of Oxford, local       
 government, AERE Harwell, the         
 National Health Service and similar   
 organisations. Many people working at 
 British Leyland Cowley also live in   
 the area.                             
 About 220 people, most of them local, 
 are employed within the area at       
 Timbmet which occupies the site of the
 old Chawley brickworks.
