		<content>The area is generally a low plateau,   
rising gently to the west and bisected 
by a small stream. This stream,        
Bramfield Brook, joins the larger River
Blyth a few metres to the east of the  
study block and is tidal for some 400  
metres, although this is partly        
controlled by a flood gate. In the     
great storm of 1953, the sea encroached
as far as the bridge at Wenhaston Old  
Hall. The plateau land on each side of 
the stream consists of boulder clay    
with isolated outcrops of sands and    
gravel. There are numerous ponds on the
clay, and many small quarries on the   
sandlings where sand, gravel and flints
have been extracted. There is no       
building stone in the area, and flint  
has been an important building material
for more than 1000 years.
