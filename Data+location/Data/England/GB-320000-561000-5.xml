		<content> St.Michael's church still houses      
 stolen Scottish bells, taken in       
 reprisal for its own, lost in the     
 Firth by raiders. The dangerous       
 crossing of Bowness Wath on foot, by  
 horse or by coach, was succeeded by   
 the Solway Junction Railway's Viaduct 
 (1869). Twice damaged by ice, it took 
 freight and passengers in and out of  
 Scotland until 1921, &amp; was demolished 
 as unsafe 1934/5.{PORT CARLISLE}1 mile
 East of Bowness was anciently Fisher's
 Cross, a hamlet comprising only 2     
 dwellings prior to 1819:Kirkland House
 (farm) and The Binnacle, built as an  
 Inn. By 1823 a canal and harbour were 
 built to serve Carlisle City. A branch
 of North British Railway succeeded    
 the canal(1854). Fading trade, silted 
 harbour and low viaduct all caused the
 decline of the port in the early 19C.
