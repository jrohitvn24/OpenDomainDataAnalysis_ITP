		<content> Nearly  every  Sunday  we go to{Batley
{Sports Centre.}There  are two swimming
 pools, one large, one  small. There is
 a weight  training  room, three squash
 courts, a  multi-purpose room, and big
 hall  for  Judo.  There is a badminton
 court and  tennis court outside. After
 we have been  swimming  we go upstairs
 to the  cafe.  There is a  bar  and  a
 snooker table next to the cafe. If you
 go onto the  balcony  you can see both
 swimming pools.                       
 In{Batley Library }there is a computer
 which you  can  book  time to play on.
 There  are  two  microfiche readers to
 help find  the book  you want. You can
 also borrow  video tapes, pictures and
 records.  There is  a reading  room in
 the library  containing newspapers and
 magazines.  Upstairs is an art gallery
 and at the  other  end  is a reference
 library where you can study.          </content>
