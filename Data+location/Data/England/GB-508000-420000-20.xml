		<title>20A DAY IN JANINE KERBY'S LIFE</title>
		<content> I get up at 7 a.m. have a wash and get
 dressed. For my breakfast I have toast
 and a cup of tea. I brush my hair, get
 my bag and walk to school. We have to 
 be there for 9 a.m. We read and do    
 individual study. At playtime I play  
 with my friends; we enjoy fairy tales 
 and skipping. When we go in we do     
 maths. At noon the children with      
 packed lunches go out to play whilst  
 other children eat school dinners. My 
 favourite meal is roast potatoes,     
 roast beef, Yorkshire Pudding and     
 cabbage followed by jelly whip. After 
 dinner I go out to play. At 1.15 p.m. 
 we do English, have assembly, games or
 sewing. At 3.30 p.m. we go home. I    
 help my mum to cook the tea. We have a
 hot meal in the kitchen and then go   
 into the room to watch "Crossroads",  
 "Coronation Street" or "Brookside" on 
 television. At 8.30 p.m. I go to bed. </content>
