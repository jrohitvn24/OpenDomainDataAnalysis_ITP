		<content> Generally speaking there are good     
 sport's facilities for adults and     
 children in Sittingbourne.The town has
 its own football club which is well   
 supported,and there are literally     
 dozens of youth and adult clubs in and
 around the town.St.John's and Rowena  
 Schools house a large sport's centre. 
 They offer squash,badminton,table     
 tennis,basket ball and more!There is  
 also a sport's centre in East Street  
 that offers judo ,karate,yoga,        
 weight-training,and keep-fit classes. 
 Gore Court Cricket Club has a high    
 reputation,and most of the districts  
 within the town have smaller cricket  
 clubs which play in local leagues.    
 The swimming pool has public and club 
 sessions, and although popular,is in  
 need of renewal.There is a popular    
 athletics club run at Highsted School.
