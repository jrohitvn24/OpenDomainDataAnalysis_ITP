		<title>19THE PARISH COUNCIL BURWELL.</title>
		<content>{ Parish Council Elections}are held    
 every four years.A by-election was    
 also needed this year.There were four 
 candidates for it.                    
 When the polling station closes       
 at 9.00pm they start by counting the  
 votes.Then the Deputy Returning       
 Officer anounces the result.          
 The Parish Council only puts notices  
 around the Parish. This could be why  
 the turn-out is low.Another reason    
 could be that they don't issue poll   
 cards.                                
 The successful candidate's job is to  
 go to{Parish Council meetings}at the  
{Jubilee Reading Room}and discuss      
 matters that affect the Parish.People 
 can also go to him if they have a     
 problem which he can then bring up at 
 meetings.
