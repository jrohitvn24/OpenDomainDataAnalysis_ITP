		<title>18HARVEL AT WORK</title>
		<content> In the Harvel area there are no large 
 employers.  There is a small light    
 engineering works in the centre of the
 village producing parts for the gas   
 container industry.  Farms now need   
 less workers due to mechanisation and 
 modern methods of farming.  Due to the
 increased amount of leisure time,     
 several livery and riding stables have
 been established, and recently a stud 
 farm.  Dog breeding is done on a small
 scale, and boarding kennels are also  
 provided.  Greyhounds are trained to a
 high standard on two tracks.  In such 
 a rural area, a number of local people
 sell eggs, goat's milk, fruit and     
 vegetables from the farm gate.        
 The majority of workers leave on a    
 daily basis to employment in the      
 surrounding areas of the Medway Towns,
 Gravesend or London, commuting by car,
 train or coach.                       </content>
