		<title>10Corton Field Names</title>
		<content>In Corton we have Rush  Hole Piece     
(that may once have yielded rushes for 
the church floor),Stile Way, Brick Kiln
Close{North-West of the Railway        
Station},Water Close and East Hulletts 
{Hullets means a brook with woody banks
},while others like James Corner, Lower
Beaumonts and Howe Hill are most       
likely  named after previous owners.   
There were families called Beaumont    
and Howes living in Corton in the 17th 
and 18th centuries. The Church is      
remembered by the three fields, Church 
Piece,Church Fields and Parson's Nine  
Acres.
