prizegiving, many of the exhibits are  
auctioned to raise money for the upkeep
of the Hall.                           
                                       
    The Children's Adventure Club has a
tradition of organising activities for 
the whole village. Each year they hire 
a coach and run a Summer outing to the 
seaside for anyone who wishes to go    
along. At Christmas 1984 they held a   
Christmas party and in 1985 the village
children plan to entertain the adults  
with a pantomime.                      
    The club also arranges various     
fund-raising events which are always   
well attended. A particularly          
successful and much appreciated idea   
this year was to serve cream teas in   
the garden of one of the local houses. 
Others have included coffee mornings,
