 There are many different churches and 
 religious groups in Norton Radstock.We
 have the Baptist Chapel,Kingdom Hall, 
 2 Anglican Churches,4 Methodist       
 Chapels,a Salvation Army Citadel and a
 Roman Catholic Church.St. John's is   
 the parish church and is about 200yrs.
 old.There is a statue of King Charles 
 ll.over the door.The catholic church  
 is an ancient tithe barn and is       
 dedicated to the Holy Ghost.It is the 
 only catholic church in our area and  
 has close ties with Downside Abbey.St.
 Peters,Westfield has never been       
 finished.After it was started there   
 were difficulties with the structure. 
 We have a new Citadel and often a     
 group sings in the High Street.Every  
 Good Friday there is a March of       
 Witness when people visit many of the 
 churches and chapels in the area.     </content>
