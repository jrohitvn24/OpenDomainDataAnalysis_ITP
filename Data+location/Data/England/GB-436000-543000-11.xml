		<title>11*** HISTORY OF HASWELL. **</title>
		<content>                                       
 Haswell is 6 miles East of Durham     
 city. It had a coalmine from 1835 to  
 1896. The village had about 4000      
 inhabitants when the mine was         
 working.In 1844 it exploded and killed
 95 men and boys.Michael Faraday came  
 and stayed in Haswell to find the     
 cause of the explosion.He decided that
 it was an act of God and no           
 compensation was paid.Karl Marx's     
 daughter wrote a sad song about the   
 disaster.Haswell mine was the first in
 the world to have wire rope and steel 
 cages to raise and lower the men and  
 the coal.Before that men were lowered 
 like a bucket is lowered down a       
 well.From the closure of the mine to  
 nowadays many Haswell families have   
 left to work in other areas.Many shops
 and businesses have closed down.Now   
 Haswell is a residential village.     </content>
