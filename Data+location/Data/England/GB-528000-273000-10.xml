		<title>10St Ives' Superstore</title>
		<content>   We went to the Rainbow Superstore   
 and asked 20  people some questions.  
 One of these questions was:Why do they
 shop here ? Most people shop at the   
 Rainbow because it is conveniently    
 situated and because the prices are   
 competitive,also there is a range  of 
 food and household products.          
  The Rainbow is extremely busy during 
 the week as it gets 10,000 customers. 
 Generally the cashiers are polite but 
 some people complained that the       
 service was too slow.                 
 Fridays are the busiest day of the    
 week,mostly because Rainbow keeps its 
 doors open until 9.00pm,and workers   
 sometimes just get there in time to do
 their shopping before the Rainbow     
 closes its doors.The other reasons are
 probably that people get paid on      
 Fridays and also they shop for the    
 weekend.                              </content>
