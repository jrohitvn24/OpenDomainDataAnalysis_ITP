		<title>20Bracknell 1985</title>
		<content>  Bracknell is a well planned,pleasant 
 place in which to live.It is close to 
 the M3 and M4 motorways,convenient for
 Wales,London and the whole of Southern
 England.                              
  Road safety is a major factor with   
 many underpasses and cycleways. The   
 town is notorious for the numerous    
 roundabouts - more than fifteen - but 
 there are few accidents.              
  The town is still growing.More houses
 and industrial units are planned for  
 the area near to Amen Corner.The new {
{Leisure Complex}is well under way.It  
 will include a ski-slope,skating rink 
 and garden centre.                    
   Since 1949 Bracknell has changed    
 from a village to a town of more than 
 50,000,comprising nine neighbourhood  
 areas,a town centre and excellent     
 leisure facilities.
