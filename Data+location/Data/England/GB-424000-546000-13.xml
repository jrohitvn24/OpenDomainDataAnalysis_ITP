      Using the 'homing' instinct of   
 pigeons for mans own interests has    
 been recorded for many years          
 throughout the world.                 
      The first record of organised    
 races in Kimblesworth is in the       
 1880's. These races were called       
 'Milers' when birds were released     
 singly 1 mile away from a selected    
 spot at set times. The fastest bird   
 to reach and alight on the set area   
 was the winner.                       
      The present club 'The            
 Kimblesworth Homing Society' was      
 formed in 1977 and is a member of the 
 Durham Central League.                
      The races vary in distance from  
 80 miles for birds under 12 months old
 to the longest of 520 miles from      
 Nantes in France.                     </content>
