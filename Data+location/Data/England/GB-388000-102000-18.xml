		<title>18FAMILY FARM IN SPETISBURY</title>
		<content> We have three children and farm 53O   
 acres of varied farm land, three small
 woods,fields of grass and arable land.
 Two dairies exist as separate entities
 milking approximately 1OO Freisian    
 pedigree cows in each.We also have    
 approximately 18O acres of corn,which 
 is largely barley and wheat,but a few 
 acres of oats are grown and kale for  
 cows and pheasants.We grow a few      
 Christmas trees as a cash crop,but    
 they take seven years from sapling to 
 cropping.The whole family helps on the
 farm,which also employs five fulltime 
 staff:two dairymen and three tractor  
 drivers.The farm has been in existence
 since the 13th Century,when it was    
 farmed by nuns.Long may we keep the   
 farm a family concern,that is until   
 the government makes it financially   
 impossible to stay viable.
