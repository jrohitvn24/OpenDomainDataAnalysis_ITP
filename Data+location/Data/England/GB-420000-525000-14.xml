		<content> Shildon has its own railway station on
 the branch line between Bishop        
 Auckland and Darlington.Originally    
 this line continued westwards through 
 Bishop Auckland into Weardale.        
 The road connecting Shildon with      
 Bishop Auckland cuts through the town 
 and a new by-pass is planned to open  
 in 1988, which will take traffic to   
 the west of the town, across the site 
 of the now demolished BR Wagon Works, 
 and link with the new road system     
 presently under construction around   
 Bishop Auckland.A new road was        
 constructed in 1983 at the southern   
 exit of Shildon, between New Shildon  
 and the village of Redworth.Residents 
 of Redworth were angry that the road  
 did not by-pass their village,as other
 improvements on this road connecting  
 Shildon with Darlington have done with
 the village of Heighington.           </content>
