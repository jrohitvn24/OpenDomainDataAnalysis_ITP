		<content> Like  other areas of chalk downland,  
 agriculture has claimed many acres of 
 interesting grassland and woodland.   
 There  are however still some good    
 areas left to the east of the River   
 Stour. Species-rich grassland has     
 various varieties of orchid, some on  
 their northern European limit and     
 typical flowers like marjoram, which  
 during the summer months attract many 
 different butterflies, one of the most
 familiar and typical being some of    
 the blue species. There are also      
 many insects. Some good woodland still
 remains, which attracts birds like the
 nightingale and blackcap. Olantigh    
 Towers is still surrounded by         
 parkland, which has fine specimen     
 trees and where some interesting      
 plants are still found.               
 The finest remnants of chalk grassland
 and woodland are S.S.S.I.             </content>
