		<content>  I am a 12 year old girl. At 7.30a.m. 
 I wake up,get dressed in my school    
 uniformand go downstairs to have my   
 breakfast of rice krispies &amp; orange   
 juice.Mum and Dad are at the table as 
 well.Dad is a technical manager at an 
 aluminium foil company &amp; Mum is a     
 dinner lady at a primary school.      
  About 8.15 my friend comes to catch  
 the bus with me as we live 4 miles    
 from school(our buses are free). At   
 school we do Geography,Games, Art,    
 Maths, Science &amp; English.             
  At 12.10 it's dinner break &amp; we can  
 have a cafeteria lunch or sandwiches. 
 We have a short break at 10.40 for a  
 drink.                                
  In the afternoon the bus reaches home
 about  4.10p.m. If I have homework    
 from school I do that; if not Iplay   
 tennis, watch television or organise  
 my stamp collection.                  </content>
