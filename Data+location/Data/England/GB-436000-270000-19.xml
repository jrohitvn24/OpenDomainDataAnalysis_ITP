		<title>19Village shops in Bubbenhall</title>
		<content> The post office in Bubbenhall is the  
 only shop in the village and most     
 daily shopping is done here.The post  
 office is in a fairly secluded area   
 at the bottom of the main street next 
 to the playing field.The sub          
 postmaster thought they missed many   
 customers who where passing through   
 the village,because of it's           
 remoteness.The post office is made of 
 corrugated plastic and built so it    
 butts onto the side of a house called 
 Ludgates View.The old post office     
 closed down in 1960 it is now a house 
 called The Hollys.A new post office   
 did not open until 1970 so they did   
 not have a shop for 10 years.Village  
 people do not visit the store for most
 of their shopping ,they just come for 
 the essentials,mainly shopping in     
 Leamington Spa and Coventry.
