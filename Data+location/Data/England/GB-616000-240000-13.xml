		<title>13THE AIRPORT, IPSWICH.</title>
		<content> The airport is a civil airport,       
covering a large part of South-east    
Ipswich. The grass runway limits the   
size of aircraft to pleasure craft.    
  Opened in 1935 by H.Balfour, it was  
originally designed in preparation for 
the threat of war.Today, it's use is   
domimated by flying clubs, one of the  
largest being "The Ipswich Flying      
School".Here people can learn the art  
of flying solo or parachuting.         
  The future of the airport is always  
uncertain.Speculation includes it's    
change of use to an out of town Hyper- 
market,expansion as a regional airport 
or for industrial land.                
 Today the shabby buildings are also   
used for squash courts and bars.
