		<title>09PEOPLE OF BECKLEY &amp; HORTON</title>
		<content>Very many people in the area have lived
in their present house for less than   
ten years. Although most of the people 
work in Oxford, a number work in       
Bicester and in the area itself. Some  
commute to London, Southampton and     
other places. By far the most popular  
way of travelling to work is by car.   
Our survey showed that 40% of the      
people did their main shopping for food
in Headington. Other people shop in    
Oxford 18%, Wheatley 14%, Bicester 10%,
and Horton-cum-Studley 7%. There is no 
shop in Beckley. The most popular pets 
are dogs and cats but chickens, horses,
rabbits and fish are also popular.     
Other pets shown in our survey included
ducks, guinea pigs, hamsters, donkeys  
and birds. 26% of the homes did not    
have any pets.
