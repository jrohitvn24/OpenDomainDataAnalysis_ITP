		<title>02FARMING - PETWORTH RURAL NE</title>
		<content> The biggest farm, Marshall's, is about
 550 acres including the small outlying
 units it controls. It employs six     
 men,three living in farm cottages and 
 three outside workers. Lowfold Farm   
 is 400 acres, Linfold 140, Gownfold   
 120, (worked by the farmer and his    
 son) Buckfold 60, worked by the farmer
 only, Bulchins only 15 acres. Crops   
 are winter wheat, barley or oats.     
 Lowfold make 2,000 tons of silage.    
 Gownfold has half pasture, half       
 cerials, and Buckfold grows corn only 
 for the stock, and potatoes to sell at
 the farm gate. Horses are no longer   
 used and the combine harvester, based 
 on Marshall's Farm, is borrowed by the
 others as needed. In one well-to-do   
 house the mother was ironing shirts   
 for her son who had parted from his   
 girl friend and brought his washing   
 home. Domestic help is hard to find.  </content>
