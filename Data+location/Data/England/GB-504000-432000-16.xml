		<title>16    North Hull Estate</title>
		<content> North Hull Eatate is quite a large    
 estate - many thousands of people live
 here.  There are many houses, flats   
 and bungalows.  Most people live in   
 terraced houses, some live in semi-   
 detached houses and a few live in     
 detached houses.  Most of the houses  
 have brick walls and slate roofs but  
 there are different designs.  There   
 are some prefabs, which were built    
 just after the second world war as    
 temporary houses but they are still in
 use today, about 40 years later.      
 There are Groves, Closes, Avenues,    
 Roads and Streets.  The avenue names  
 are often numbers like 5th Avenue.    
 Some groves and closes just have old  
 people living in them.  The bungalows 
 are very convenient for the old       
 people. Very few houses have garages  
 because not many people had cars when 
 the estate was built.                 </content>
