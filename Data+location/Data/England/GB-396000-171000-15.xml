		<title>15Breeding Dogs in Calne.</title>
		<content>   German Shepherd dogs first came from
 Germany.They were used for herding    
 sheep.My father is breeding them.My   
 bitch Bella has had five pups.Before I
 go to school, we give them Weetbix or 
 porridge.In the evening we give them  
 minced meat and milk.                 
   We have Labrador pups as well.We    
 feed them the same food but less,yet  
 they are really fat.                  
   We mated our yellow Labrador bitch  
 Tessa with a black Labrador.Two of our
 pups went to Dodington Estate,to be   
 trained as gun dogs.                  
   Our German Shepherd pups,also called
 Alastains we sell for 130 pounds.Our  
 Labrador pups go for 80 pounds.       
   My name is Keeley Agar and I live in
 Oxford Road,Calne.
