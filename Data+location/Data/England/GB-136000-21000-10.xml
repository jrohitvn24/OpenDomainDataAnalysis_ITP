		<title>10A Trip to Minack, St. Levan</title>
		<content> On Thursday we went to Minack Theatre 
 to see Seven Brides for Seven         
 Brothers. There was a queue. It opened
 at six thirty, we went down the steps 
 and a lady told everybody where to    
 sit. We sat on the first seats. We    
 said to Debbie to get the pasties from
 the carpark. She took ages to get down
 the steps. The pasties were lovely. We
  sat on a sleeping bag and put        
 blankets around us, we also watched   
 fulmars and gannets out at sea. There 
 were also cormorants diving. In the   
 middle of the play we had a bit of    
 drizzle, then it began to rain quite a
 bit. Once a saw a fulmar go by during 
 the play. I thought the best bit of   
 the play was when Adam stopped and the
 brothers bumped into him. I couldn't  
 stop laughing. The rain was coming    
 down heavier. The play finished at    
 10-15pm. I enjoyed myself.            </content>
