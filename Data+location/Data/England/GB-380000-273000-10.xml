		<title>10Kidderminster, Rifle Range</title>
		<content> The area known as the Rifle Range was,
 as the name suggests, once used as a  
 wartime artillery range.              
 It is bordered on the north by the    
 A456, the main road between the       
 Midlands and Central Wales, the West  
 Midlands Safari Park to the west and  
 the Severn Valley Railway to the      
 south. The east side is an escarpment,
 on the top of which stands Birchen    
 Coppice Schools.                      
 The Rifle Range is now an area of     
 outstanding natural beauty,           
 administered by the Worcestershier    
 Conservation Trust. It is one of the  
 few remaining regions of dry, lowland 
 heath left in the Midlands.           
 Prominent in the middle is the Devil's
 Spittleful or Spadeful, a sandstone   
 outcrop.
