		<content>   Most families have at{least one car,
 but there is still a heavy reliance on
{public transport}as it is necessary to
 travel from the area for many         
 services, hospitals, large shops and  
 work. The area is served by many{bus  
{routes}from Manchester, Oldham, Ashton
 and Huddersfield, although they are   
 not very frequent tot outlying areas. 
 There is a lot of concern at present  
 that these services may be further    
{reduced}as a result of legislation.   
   The Manchester to Leeds{railway}line
 runs through Uppermill,which does not 
 have a station. Some trains do however
 stop at the neighbouring village of   
 Greenfield.                           
   {Traffic problems}are not a feature 
 of the area, except at weekends in the
 summer when the influx of visitors    
 causes some congestion.
