		<title>12HOUSING (CONT)</title>
		<content> The majority of houses were of the    
 3-bedroomed semi-detached type with a 
 minority of terraced housing. Less    
 than 30% had garages adjacent to the  
 property although several lock-up     
 garages were provided nearby. Both    
 front &amp; back gardens were small &amp;     
 compact but adequate recreational     
 space was available                   
 elsewhere(Playgrounds &amp; grass         
 commons). Building materials consisted
 almost entirely of brickwork with clay
 tiles. Asizeable proportion of family 
 homes (23%) provided rented rooms. In 
 general the housing was in a good     
 state of repair but there were some   
 indications of neglect, such as       
 flaking                               
 paint, loose drainpipes &amp; rotting     
 doors &amp; window-frames.  One major     
 source of concern was the slowness &amp;  
 inefficiency of local council repairs.</content>
