		<title>14 Barnwell's Womens Institute</title>
		<content>Barnwell WI has come a long way in a   
short time,although basically it still 
has its roots of"Hearth and Home".     
Now it has been rejuvenated into an era
of computers,silicon chips and         
microwave ovens. Its image of jam and  
Jerusalem is a thing of the past,and   
Barnwell a small link in the chain     
which started in a house in Stoney     
Creek, Ontario, Canada in 1897. It     
has a good working membership of 35    
with a good number of young people     
coming up to fill places in the years  
ahead. It meets once a month in        
the Reading Room and affords many      
instructive and educational speakers.  
It regularly takes part in competitive 
classes at the East of England Show    
and the Oundle Music Festival. Members 
talents are many and varied which go   
to make a thriving womens' rural       
community organisation.                </content>
