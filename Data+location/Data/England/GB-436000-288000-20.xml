		<content> All of those who have worked on the   
 Domesday Project over the past few    
 months have felt very priviledged to  
 be part of a large team. It has been  
 hard but enjoyable work. As organiser 
 of the 12 squares I would like to     
 thank all the children and their      
 teachers of the 3 schools who took    
 part and collected all the relevant   
 information. There are obviously too  
 many to mention by name here. Thanks  
 too to the many adults who provided   
 information to all the questions asked
 of them in the survey. Special thanks 
 to Mrs Yvonne Pitt who took all the   
 photographs and provided a great deal 
 of all the background information     
 concernced.
