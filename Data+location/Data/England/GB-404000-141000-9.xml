		<content> On the 12 June we decided to carry out
 a traffic survey on the A360, the main
 Salisbury to Devizes road, which runs 
 through Shrewton.                     
   We were divided into two groups, one
 group recording traffic travelling    
 towards Devizes, the other group      
 recording traffic towards Salisbury.  
   We counted cars, lorries/vans,motor-
 bikes, bicycles,army vehicles,buses   
 and pedestrians.We counted for 20     
 minutes starting at 1.45p.m. and      
 11.00a.m and multiplied the results by
 3 to give the number of vehicles per  
 hour. The position from which we      
 counted was 13 miles from Devizes and 
 13 miles from Warminster.             
   There is a chart combining both sets
 of results on the next page.          
   Cars were the most common vehicle   
 passing through the village,then vans 
 and lorries,and then motorbikes.      </content>
