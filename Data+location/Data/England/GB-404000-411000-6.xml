 In September there is a festival in   
 Marsden.There are a lot of stalls with
 things to buy and games to play.These 
 are usually on Wessen court by the old
 people's flats if the weather is fine,
 and they are in the mill canteen at   
 the bottom of Fall Lane if it is wet. 
 There is a procession with a rush cart
 and the White Rose dancers.They do    
 morris dancing and have red ,white and
 black costumes.There is a carnival    
 queen and she rides in an old car or  
 in a horse and cart.In the            
 Conservative club they serve          
 refreshments and the fancy dress      
 competition is down at the youth club 
 at Lake Side. There is a rush cart and
 a bouncy castle.You can go up the     
 church tower to the top.
