		<content> Interview with resident (cont'd):     
    Here, the E.E.C.'s cumbersome      
 bureaucracy has caused such delay that
 local support is evaporating in       
 disillusionment as people lose faith. 
 He would welcome widespread tree-     
 planting in place of arterial roads   
 linking Devon with the rest of        
 Britain; but the new link-road will   
 cause severe  congestion around Fairy 
 Cross, bringing ever more outsiders to
 transplant their own suburban mini-   
 environments into this attractive     
 area, to conduct industrial management
 increasingly by computer-link.  Other 
 detrimental changes include farmer's  
 wanton destruction of hedgerows,      
 causing dramatic losses in variety and
 quantity of flora and fauna.  He is   
 thrilled to live here,however, despite
 the hazardous waters of Bideford Bay, 
 till he moves permanently to Cornwall.</content>
