    I STARTED SCHOOL-THE ONE IN THE    
VILLAGE-WHEN I WAS 4 YEARS OLD. I      
STAYED THERE TILL I WAS NEARLY 14. IN  
THOSE DAYS,IF YOU HAD ATTENDED         
REGULARLY,YOU WERE ALLOWED TO LEAVE    
BEFORE THE OTHERS.                     
    MOST OF US WALKED TO SCHOOL BUT    
THOSE WHO LIVED WAY DOWN IN THE FEN    
CAME BY HORSE AND CART.                
    THERE WAS NO SCHOOL UNIFORM BUT THE
HEADMASTER LIKED THE GIRLS TO WEAR A   
PINAFORE AND THE BOYS A LARGE WHITE    
CELLULOID COLLAR OVER THEIR CLOTHES.   
    WE LEARNT TO READ,WRITE AND DO     
SUMS-WE USED TO CHANT OUR TABLES.WE    
WROTE ON SLATES-IN WINTER THESE WERE SO
COLD THAT WE WORE MITTENS.             
    AT PLAYTIMES,A HIGH FENCE SEPARATED
THE BOYS FROM THE GIRLS.ON A HOT DAY A 
BUCKET OF COLD WATER AND AN ENAMEL MUG 
WERE PUT IN THE PORCH FOR US.          </content>
