		<title>01Living in Coatham</title>
		<content> My name is Sean Murphy. I live in a   
 terraced house on Coatham Road. In our
 family there is my Mam and Dad. I also
 have one brother and two sisters. My  
 Dad works for British Telecom and my  
 Mam works at an Italian restaurant    
 called "Nino on the Sea".             
                                       
 Living in Coatham is very nice because
 it is near the beach and sand dunes.  
 At Coatham there is a place called the
 Beck and in the summer I go to catch  
 stickle-backs. Sometimes we see water 
 rats.                                 
                                       
 The school that I go to is called     
 Coatham C.E. Primary School. It is    
 very good because it has a field. In  
 the class room there is a wet area    
 with a sink. The church in Coatham is 
 very nice but there has been a lot of 
 vandalism to the grave stones.        </content>
