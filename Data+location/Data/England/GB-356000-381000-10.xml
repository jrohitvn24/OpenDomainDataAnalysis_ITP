		<content>        In this survey we surveyed     
 buses and we found that the buses only
 came one every hour, and that         
 sometimes they never came at all.     
        The service is very unreliable,
 and for the three hours we were there,
 only two buses came.                  
        The buses that run through the 
 village are the C30 to Chester or     
 Warrington.                           
        The bus stops are both situated
 by the "Ring O'Bells" public house in 
 the centre of Daresbury, by the       
 church.                               
        The nearest railway station is 
 at Runcorn East, which is two miles   
 away. Transport to the nearby towns of
 Warrington,Runcorn and Chester is     
 therefore difficult unless people have
 their own cars.
