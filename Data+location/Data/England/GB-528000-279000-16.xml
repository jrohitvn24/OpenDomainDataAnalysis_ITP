		<title>16EXPLAINING THE WARBOYS SIGN</title>
		<content> The sign has two sides. One side shows
 the brickyard (which has since closed 
 down) and a ploughing team to show the
 main means of employment,the other    
 shows the Manor House and the huntsmen
 represent the meet that used to take  
 place. The mill is a reminder that the
 village once had three mills, all now 
 demolished. The sign is supported by  
 two witches which are a reminder of   
 the connection of Warboys with        
 witchcraft. The stones for the plinth 
 were gathered by village children.    
 The sign was unveiled on the 18th.    
 July, 1981. A plaque commemorates the 
 wedding of Prince Charles and Lady    
 Diana Spencer on the 29th.July, 1981. 
 Two children from the school unveiled 
 the sign. Justin Dyer represented the 
 families who had lived in the village 
 for many years and Sarah Bowen the    
 families who had recently arrived.    </content>
