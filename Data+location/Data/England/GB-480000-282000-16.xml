		<title>16Interview with an Editor</title>
		<content>{CLIFF GAROD }is an assistant  to the  
 editor.He started as a reporter in    
 1940.The {Evening Telegraph }was      
 founded in 1897 at Kettering.Kettering
 was the smallest town to post the     
 Evening paper.The Evening Telegraph   
 carried news in the Boer war in South 
 Africa, and had to restore news press 
 to cope with the demand to news papers
 that the war created.All the war news 
  arrived at the office in a form of   
 telegrams .The Evening Telegraph soon 
 installed wired telegraph equipment   
 and the news could then be received on
 tape which was printed by machine.They
 used to call it Ticker Tape and it had
 to be printed onto sheets of paper.   
 Today the E.T.is still installing up  
 to date technology putting banks of   
 teleprinters and each machine could   
 receive news at about ninety words per
 minute.                               </content>
