		<content> The landscape of Block 03850564       
 Domesday 1985 has changed little since
 William Cobbett wrote in Rural        
 Rides,1830,"..these sides of Tyne are 
 very fine: corn-fields, woods,        
 pastures". Grass is the natural       
 product of this land. It still is and 
 the cattle &amp; sheep which dominate are 
 still as "beautiful" &amp; "handsome" as  
 those Cobbett saw. The Railway he     
 watched men building still serves us. 
 Important recent changes include the  
 extension of council housing into the 
 south-eastern square kilometre of the 
 block, &amp; a secondary school was built 
 there in 1962 and extended in 1874 &amp;  
 84. In the pages which follow we      
 concentrate on landscape, farming, our
 school and historic stone houses.     
 William I took no evidence from       
 N.E.England so we used the 1851 census
 &amp; mining records.                     </content>
