		<title>02QUICKE'S FARM NEWTON ST.C.</title>
		<content> The cows eat silage and straw and the 
 pigs eat it too. They give the pigs   
 the whey that came from the cheese    
 factory. If they eat too much whey    
 they get 'tummy ache' and are sick.   
 The number of animals is{302 cows and 
{160 pigs.} There are{17 tractors}and  
 most of them are John Deere because   
 they are{four wheel drive}and will go 
 over rough ground better than the old 
 tractors. There are{43 people working 
{on the farm including the cheese      
{factory.                              
 Dung is pumped into a cuboid shaped   
 pit where it is thinned out.Later it  
 is pumped into a large lagoon (or pong
 pond as Mary Quicke  calls it). The   
{slurry}is dried out to be put on the  
 land.{Some villagers have complained  
{about the smell.
