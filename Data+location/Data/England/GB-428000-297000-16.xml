		<title>16POEM OF THE ROYAL VISIT</title>
		<content>We were in our places,Ready to act our 
play,Waiting for the Princess,It was   
our special day.Then in walked Prince  
Charles,Into a hall of applause,Next we
saw Princess Diana walking through the 
doors.They were followed by the equerry
Then they took their chairs,We started 
to play our music,The procession came  
on in pairs.I wasn't very nervous,As   
the time went by,I saw Princess Diana  
smiling,Even thought she looked shy.   
The end of our play ,Soon it was in    
sight,The tele cameras filming,The sun 
shone very bright.When our play had    
finished,Lady Di walked around,She even
came and talked to us,We didn't make a 
sound.Soon she had left,And Â£our'day   
had finished,I'm really glad they came,
Just a dream accomplished.
