		<content> As you might expect with an area which
 has such a detailed connection with   
 the past,there are quite a few tales  
 of the{Supernatural}.                 
 Most of these are centred around      
 places where people meet,and two of   
 the most interesting are based in     
 local public houses.                  
 The landlord of the{Cherry Tree}which 
 was built over 500 years ago,is       
 convinced that he has seen the ghost  
 of a young attractive lady.Some of his
 customers have too,although the ghost 
 only seem's to show herself to men!   
 The{Castle} is the only remaining     
 Inn,in Ramsey(which once boasted      
 4),and we are told that this building 
 has more than one spirit haunting it! 
 At different times a lady in a black  
 dress,a black cat,and the sound of an 
 invisible piano being played,have all 
 been reported;the local ale is strong!</content>
