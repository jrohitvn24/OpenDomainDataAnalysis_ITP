		<content> At{home}my{favourite thing}is playing 
 with my dolls because it gives me fun 
 and enjoyment. On{days out}I like     
 going shopping at Cheltenham I buy    
 clothes and have lunch at McDonalds.  
 When we go on{holiday}I like going in 
 the swimming pool. We go to a         
 restaurant at night. My favourite{food
 is banana splits and knickerbocker -  
 glories because they are filled with  
 lots of nice things like ice-cream,   
 cherries and jelly. At{school} I like 
 P.E. On sports day we do all sorts of 
 sports. I like running, it's good fun.
 My favourite{clothes}are jeans, summer
 dresses and my shorts. I like my      
 summer dress because the design is    
 like paints splashed on and mixed     
 lightly. My favourite{T.V. programmes}
 are Dallas, The A-Team and Dungeons   
 and Dragons.
