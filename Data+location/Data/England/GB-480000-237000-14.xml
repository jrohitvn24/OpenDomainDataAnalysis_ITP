		<title>14A CARPENTER'S DAY</title>
		<content> Every morning, except Sundays, my dad 
 goes to work at about 7.30 am to      
 Bletchley to his boss to see where    
 he's got to work that day. There's a  
 job at Stacey Bushes to set a pane of 
 glass in.When the builders put the    
 glass in the frame,there was splinters
 of glass in the putty.So when they put
 the glass in the putty it wasn't put  
 in properly and three days later when 
 the people were moving in, the glass  
 fell out.So Dad went to Stacey Bushes 
 to work on the frame.When Dad got to  
 the house he found the frame and he   
 got out his chisel and hammer to get  
 out the putty out from the frame.When 
 Dad had got rid of putty he put a new 
 pane of glass in,put the putty on the 
 frame, and left it to dry.At five Dad 
 came home from work.
