		<content> When the alarm clock rings at 7.30am  
 it's time to get up and have our      
 breakfast.We have cereal which        
 consists of either Weetabix or        
 Cornflakes then we have toast which is
 done in an electric toaster.Also for  
 breakfast we have a cold or hot drink 
 like tea,coffee,orange or milk.For our
 midday snack we have a few sandwiches,
 a packet of crisps and a cold         
 drink.For our evening meal we         
 sometimes have beefburgers and        
 chips.If the weather is hot we might  
 have a salad.On Sundays we have a     
 roast dinner.                         
 In Barrowby many people have showers  
 and most homes in the village have    
 toilets,sinks and bath.In the lounge  
 there is usually a television.Most    
 kitchens are equipped with a          
 fridge,a freezer,a cooker,an electric
