 resulting increase in productive      
 efficiency has brought widespread     
 change to the D-Block and throughout  
 the area.Fewer men are needed to work 
 the land, yet the population of       
 Stalham has expanded rapidly in the   
 last 15 years.                        
{EMPLOYMENT                            
 A randam sample of 32 houses in the   
 D-BLOCK were surveyed to investigate  
 work patterns. Significantly,only one 
 man worked directely on the land. This
 compares with the county council      
 estimate of only 3% across the county.
 Only 7% worked in the primary or      
 extractive sector, 20% in the         
 secondary or manufacturing sector but 
 73% worked in the tertiary or service 
 industries: estate agent, R.A.F. at   
 Coltishall, insurance, accountant.    </content>
