		<title>07SECRETARY FOR EDUCATION</title>
		<content> In 1950 Mr Norman   Barr began work in
 North Devon as a teacher.   Later,  in
 Derbyshire,an opportunity came for him
 to  enter  administration.            
 He became Deputy  Secretary for Educa-
 tion in Cornwall in 1976 and Secretary
 in 1982.                              
 His  job   includes  writing  letters,
 ordering school meals supplies,dealing
 with  college   grants   and   keeping
 records. His favourite tasks are going
 into  primary  schools and  talking to
 teachers.                             
 If he had not gone  into Education  he
 might have become a linguist, mathema-
 tician,  farmer or even a professional
 gardener.                             
 Mr Barr lives in Perranwell.  He likes
 it there  because  the  village people
 get on well together.     He chose his
 house because it suited his family and
 there were plenty of trees.           </content>
