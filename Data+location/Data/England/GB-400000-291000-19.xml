		<title>19Mayor of West Bromwich</title>
		<content> Trung, Janine, Wendy,Jane,Harjit and I
 wrote to the Mayor of Sandwell asking 
 if we might interview him for the     
 Domesday project. We arranged the     
 interview with his secretary.         
 When we arrived the car park attendant
 took us to meet the Mayor's Assistant 
 who took us to the Mayor's parlour. We
 shook hands with his Worship and sat  
 down in black leather armchairs. The  
 table in front of the Mayor was taken 
 up by documents, silverware and a few 
 trophies. It was a rich luxurious room
 as a lot of important people come to  
 see the mayor.                        
 The mayor told us about Blanc-Mesnil, 
 the French town twinned with West     
 Bromwich. People from Blanc-Mesnil    
 visit us and we visit them. We have   
 pen-pals and send books and postcards 
 to each other. It helps improve       
 international relationships.M.Fiaz 13 </content>
