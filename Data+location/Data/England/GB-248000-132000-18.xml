		<title>18Transport in Fremington Area</title>
		<content>   Fremington is one of the small towns
 that has grown up along the A396, the 
 main road from Barnstaple to Bideford.
 This road is always busy but in summer
 it gets very crowded because of the   
 extra traffic caused by all the       
 holiday-makers going to the           
 seaside. Lots of local people don't   
 like it. Every year there are lots of 
 serious road accidents, but it would  
 be difficult to alter the road to make
 it safer because there are houses all 
 along it.                             
   We did a survey using the families  
 in the school to find out about their 
 cars. Nearly every family had a car   
 and some had more. The most common    
 cars were Fords. Red was the most     
 popular colour. Most families did     
 about 200 miles a week, going to work 
 shopping, and going on trips. People  
 with cars almost never used buses.    </content>
