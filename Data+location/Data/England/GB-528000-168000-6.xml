		<content> We found by walking every street in 3 
 km squares that more than half the    
 area is residential.  We used a map of
 all 12 squares to record numbers.  A  
 grid overlay on the map and           
 co-ordinates chosen at random were    
 used to pinpoint 300 houses:  we found
 79% terraced 12% semi-detached and 9% 
 detached.  This agrees with the high  
 density housing we saw and the        
 scarcity of detached houses and large 
 plots.                                
 We grouped the age of houses into     
 Victorian, Inter-War and Modern       
 (virtually no houses prior to 1837).  
 The majority are Victorian and        
 Inter-War, corresponding to the great 
 expansion of London suburbs and the   
 provision of good road and rail links.
