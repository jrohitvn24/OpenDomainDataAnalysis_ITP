		<content>The police station in Garstang has     
always been in Bowgrave,originally it  
was a house.The station is one of the  
oldest in Lancashire. It is situated in
Bowgrave because the road running past 
was the main stage coach route between 
London and Edinburgh.Since it became a 
police station few changes have taken  
place,a Lion Intoximeter 3000 has been 
installed and the remainder of the     
house has been made into offices.      
At Garstang there are no mounted police
because they are placed at Hutton,some 
do occasionally visit Garstang at the  
Whit Festival and other important      
events.The Lion Intoximeter mentioned  
earlier measures the amount of alcohol 
in a drivers breath.A policeman's job  
involves the protection of life and    
property,the maintenance of law and    
order and the prosecution of offenders
