		<title>14Local History The R. Stour</title>
		<content>    When we went out we saw the River  
 Stour. It was quite bendy.It was      
 brown,very deep in parts and shallow  
 in other parts.The river separated    
 Essex from Suffolk.The banks were not 
 steep.They were grassy and quite      
 beautiful.The water was cold.We saw   
 two Damselflies which were blue and   
 green.                                
    At one time barges used to go up   
 river to the mill at Bures.The river  
 flowed too quickly for the barges and 
 so they cut a new channel to make the 
 river bend instead of go straight. The
 county boundary had always been the   
 river and even after the change       
 continued to follow the old           
 course.This has resulted in there     
 being a small area of 4.605 acres of  
 land which is north of the river and  
 still in Essex.
