		<title>10CHURCH AND RELIGION PT2</title>
		<content>  For the young who live in the area,  
 the Church is seen as functional_ in  
 terms of baptisms,weddings &amp; funerals_
 and the clergy are still viewed with  
 slight fear &amp; suspicion, for until    
 fairly recently they were seen as part
 of the ruling classes.                
  Church attendance is fairly high     
 among the elderly and the retired but 
 low among the young and the indigenous
 population. "Chapel" not "Church" was 
 customary for the working man in      
 living memory, and with the decline in
 attendance at non_conformist churches,
 the Parish Church is seeking to       
 re_discover its ancient role as a     
 symbol of unity and cohesion in an    
 increasingly diverse community.       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
