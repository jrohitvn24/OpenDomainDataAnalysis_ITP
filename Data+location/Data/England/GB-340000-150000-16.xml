		<title>16A Day in the life of Dafydd</title>
		<content> In the morning I wash in the bedroom  
 and get dressed into socks,shirt,     
 shorts and tie.Then for breakfast I   
 have Rice Krispies,orange juice and   
 toast.I clean my teeth and pack my bag
 for school.In it I put a book,two     
 sweets and a football sticker.I play a
 game on the computer or watch         
 television until 8:48a.m.when it is   
 time to get on the bus for school.When
 I arrive I play games with my friends 
 in the playground.At 9:10a.m. a       
 teacher blows the whistle and I stand 
 still until it is time for my class to
 go inside.I sit at my table and read  
 my book until we start maths.I listen 
 to the teacher and then work from a   
 text book.When I have finished I do a 
 Reading Workshop card and go to       
 Service in the hall.We often hear a   
 good story about Jesus.I have my milk 
 next and go to play tag outside.      </content>
