 A DINNER COSTS 58p PER DAY. I HAVE    
 SCHOOL DINNERS. WE HAVE SMALL GREY    
 DINNER TABLES WHICH SEAT UP TO FOUR   
 PEOPLE.WE HAVE ONE DINNER LADY.WE LAY 
 OUR OWN DINNER TABLES WITH CUTLERY AND
 THEN SAY 'GRACE'.WE HAVE SALAD ONCE A 
 WEEK,THE REST OF THE FOOD IS DEEP     
 FROZEN AND HEATED IN THE UPSTAIRS     
 KITCHEN.MY FAVOURITE DINNERS ARE      
 CORNISH PASTY,SCALLOPS,HOT POT AND    
 CARROTS. THE ONES I DISLIKE ARE MUSHY 
 PEAS,BROAD BEANS AND FISH. THE        
 DESSERTS I LIKE ARE THE CRUMBLES AND  
 SPONGES. THE ONE I HATE IS CHOCOLATE  
 TART.THE DINNER LADY SERVES THE FOOD  
 FROM A HOT TROLLEY.AFTER DINNER WE    
 PLAY IN THE PLAYGROUND.ANOTHER LADY   
 LOOKS AFTER US.
