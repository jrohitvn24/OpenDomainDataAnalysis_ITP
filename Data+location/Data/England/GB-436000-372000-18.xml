		<content>  Every year on November 5th there is a
 bonfire and lots of fireworks in Stand
 Road Park. The fire is built &amp; super- 
 vised by firemen in an effort to enco-
 urage people to attend rather than to 
 build their own bonfires at home which
 are usually responsible for so many   
 accidents each year. The bonfire is   
 very large and thousands of people    
 attend the spectacle. On the top of   
 the fire is placed an effigy of Guy   
 Fawkes who burns to loud cheers from  
 the crowd. The firemen provide a very 
 colourful firework display and there  
 are vans where hot food and soup can  
 be bought. It does not cost anything  
 to attend the bonfire but voluntary   
 contributions are taken and donated to
 charity. Also in the park at this time
 as a further attraction there is a    
 travelling fair where people can go on
 rides and try to win prizes.          </content>
