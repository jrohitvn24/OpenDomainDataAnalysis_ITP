		<title>02A typical farm in Marnhull.</title>
		<content>  Most farms in Marnhull are dairy     
 farms,because it's fairly wet and a   
 lot of land is clay,producing  thick  
 pasture.We went to visit one on the   
 edge of Marnhull.It was quite big,    
 about 380 acres,plus another little   
 farm down the road with a barn and    
 old buildings.There were 15 fields    
 mostly for silage. No other crops     
 were grown except grass.              
  The main buildings were cattle and   
 calf buildings,one new and one        
 old milking parlour;three barns,one   
 each for silage,hay and straw.        
  For machinery they used six tractors,
 one plough,two silage trailers, one   
 silager,one grass cutter, one hay     
 turner,one bailer,one round bailer,one
 hedge cutter and three dung spreaders.
 There were three full and two part    
 time workers.They actually do contract
 work for other farmers.               </content>
