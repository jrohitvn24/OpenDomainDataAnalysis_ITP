		<content> Some of us have been very surprised to
 find such a varied and attractive area
 on the doorstep of the New Town.Though
 so many footpaths and hedges have been
 removed,and with the decline in local 
 dairying,the area still retains a     
 surprising area of trees and bushes   
 all contributingto the landscape.Seen 
 from the main road in winter the area 
 looks dreary and exposed,but in early 
 summer,from within,all is different.  
 Most of the fieldwork was done in     
 early June by pupils in Remove and U1 
 St Nicholas School.Help from parents  
 and relatives is acknowledged with    
 thanks,also the varied contributions  
 of West Essex Farmers,Latton Priory   
 Farm,Takeleys Farm,Harlow Council     
 leisure services,Essex Gliding Club   
 and the Blacksmiths Arms.Many other   
 individual contributions were made-   
 our thanks for these too.             </content>
