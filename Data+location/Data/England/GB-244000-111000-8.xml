		<content> This village which consists of four   
 hamlets _ Winswell, Yarde, Woollaton  
 and Peters Marland, has a population  
 of 200, or 250 when Marland School is 
 in residence. Since the village school
 closed, children of Primary School age
 have gone to Merton.  Children aged   
 11_16 go to the Torrington            
 Comprehensive School. Buses take      
 children to these schools.  The old   
 school now acts as a Village Hall.    
 Social events such as Whist Drives,   
 Discos, a Christmas Party, and the    
 Womens' Institute meetings are held   
 there. There are no shops in the      
 vullage.  Most of the shopping is done
 in Torrington, Bideford or Barnstaple.
 The Post Office is at Twigbeare. The  
 area is served by a bus from          
 Okehampton which goes to Bideford and 
 Torrington on Tuesdays and Saturdays, 
 and Barnstaple on Fridays.            </content>
