		<title>04SHOPPING-DUNTON GREEN AREA</title>
		<content> The main shopping areas in Dunton     
 Green,Chipstead &amp; Riverhead are a     
 block of shops at D.G. and two fairly 
 small parades in Riverhead. Chipstead 
 has a general grocery store and a Post
 Office. The shops in D.G. are         
 grocers,bakers,butchers,electrical,   
 hairdressers &amp; others. Riverhead has a
 wider selection. A survey of shoppers 
 in Dunton Green showed that a few of  
 them do their everyday shopping here  
 but mostly they shop at the two       
 supermarkets in Sevenoaks with more   
 using Tesco than Waitrose. People     
 mostly go out of D.G. to buy clothes &amp;
 shoes, Sevenoaks, Bromley &amp; Orpington 
 being the main areas used. The shop   
 most people miss in D.G. is a chemist.
