		<content>   Different areas in Bramley have     
 different problems. The private       
 estates have stealing as their        
 greatest problem, whereas council     
 estates are more prone to assaults.   
 There are enough policemen to cover   
 the area with cars to help them. The  
 main office is in Godalming and it    
 looks after Haslemere, Cranleigh and  
 other villages nearby.                
   There was a relatively recent crime 
 involving an eighteen year old boy    
 vandalising the small Grafham Church, 
 probably after having drink and drugs 
 (drugs are only a small problem in the
 area). Burglar alarms are used by only
 a few people as 90% of them are set   
 off accidentally and dogs are more    
 effective.
