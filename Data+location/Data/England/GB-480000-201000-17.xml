		<title>17PRINCES RISBOROUGH FAIR</title>
		<content>A charter granted by King Henry VIII   
gave Princes Risborough a fair and also
a weekly market both of which remain.  
The day of the market has changed over 
the years from Wednesday to Saturday,  
but still occupies the Market Square in
the centre of town.                    
The Fair comes to Princes Risborough   
twice a year. The Fair dutes have      
changed over the centuries to May 6th  
and October 21st.                      
The Fair is only allowed to operate in 
Princes Risborough for three days and  
is allowed to come in one day before.  
The Fair usually causes a lot of       
traffic problems because they are      
entitled to occupy the Market Square.  
The Fair in Princes Risborough is      
really only Suitable for children from 
four to fourteen years old. The Fair   
consists of a big wheel, round about,  
twisters, dodgems, trains and stalls.  </content>
