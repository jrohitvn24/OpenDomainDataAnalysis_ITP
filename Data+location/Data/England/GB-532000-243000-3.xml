		<content> You enter Kneesworth by the A14 or    
 the Causeway or Chestnut Lane. In     
 Kneesworth there are two pubs a shop  
 and two estates. The estates are      
{Canberra Close}and{Wellington Place.  
 There is also a reservoir and a farm. 
 There have been two new houses built  
 and some old houses are being rebuilt.
  There is a big house called          
 Kneesworth House. It has been sold to 
 some Americans. They plan to use it as
 a psychiatric hospital. The villagers 
 don't like the idea.                  
  Kneesworth is very small. Between 120
 and 130 people live there.            
  As you walk up hill along Chestnut   
 Lane, to your left is a farm track    
 leading to Whaddon. Frog Hall and     
 Fountain Farm are two old buildings.  
 In Frog Hall there is the original    
 bread oven. Fountain Farm has an old  
 artesian well.                        </content>
