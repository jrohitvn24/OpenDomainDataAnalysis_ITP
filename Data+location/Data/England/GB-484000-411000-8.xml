		<content> in the Scunthorpe area.               
  The rest of Atkinsons Warren is left 
 wild but is in danger of being turned 
 into another industrial site.At the   
 moment it is desolate and there is    
 many different species of wildlife.   
  In 1910 all of the warren was        
 woodland.Part of it was cut down to   
 provide a place for the new           
 steelwork's slagheaps.These slagheaps 
 are still here,but,plans are being    
 made to clear them away for a housing 
 estate.                               
  People that use the warren for either
 leisure or work were interviewed.They 
 all liked the buildings for           
 convenience and provision of jobs in  
 an area which has many unemployed,but,
 they all wanted the warren to stay a  
 place of nature.
