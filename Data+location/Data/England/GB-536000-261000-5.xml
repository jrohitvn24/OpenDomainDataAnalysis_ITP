		<title>05DRY DRAYTON</title>
		<content>    Dry Drayton is a larger village    
 than Lolworth but much smaller than   
 Bar Hill.It is again an old           
 established village but with some     
 modern development,it too is a ribbon 
 village,on the whole.                 
    There is a bridle way, from Dry    
 Drayton to Bar Hill,called The Drift. 
 When we visited Dry Drayton we        
 interviewed some of the residents.We  
 found that most of the villagers are  
 worried about Bar Hill as they think  
 that Bar Hill could expand so much    
 that it will eventually swallow up Dry
 Drayton.Even if this doesn't happen   
 they worry that their school will be  
 closed and their children sent along  
 The Drift to Bar Hill.They are        
 also worried that thier Post          
 Office will be closed. The Drift      
 is only a grass track and Bar Hill is 
 about half a mile along it.           </content>
