		<title>06BASILDON NE: NEWCOMER'S VIEW</title>
		<content> I have lived here for five months and 
 I go to the local junior school.      
 I like living here, but the problem is
 my family live in London.             
 The town centre is very good and the  
 open-air market is cheap and helpful. 
 There are plenty of open spaces for me
 to enjoy although many are vandalised.
 I think the idea of having the        
 industrial area on the outskirts of   
 the town is a good one. I think there 
 should be more activities for children
 and teenagers. The council is good.   
 When my parents complain they always  
 come to see what the trouble is. My   
 parents find they must buy all their  
 shopping in the town because the small
 local shops are expensive. My dad says
 it is wrong to put up the fees in the 
 car park, but apart from that, we     
 think Basildon a good place to live.
