		<content> Herefords, and Long-horns. Some       
 beef-cattle are bred, Friesian x      
 Charollais.  Some sheep are reared for
 meat, some birds (pheasants) for game 
 or eating, goats for milk and meat,   
 horses for riding, dogs, cats and     
 small animals for pets.               
    The main crops grown are kale and  
 hay for cattle, wheat, oats, barley,  
 potatoes, mangolds, turf for lawns,   
 and rape for seed merchants.  In      
 spring the patchwork of fields        
 includes  beautiful patches of yellow 
 made by the flowers of the rape.      
 There is some market-gardening on a   
 small scale, and people travel seven  
 miles from Derby to buy raspberries,  
 strawberries, salad vegetables and    
 other vegetables __ carrots, cabbage, 
 cauliflowers, peas, beans and onions. 
 Several people sell free-range eggs,  
 and others keep bees and sell locally-</content>
