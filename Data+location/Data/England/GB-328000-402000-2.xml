		<content>   The tasks{Mr. Wright}starts after   
 breakfast at{Hill Farm,}vary each day 
 according to the season and the       
 weather on his{arable 200 acre farm.  
   In the middle of the morning Mr.    
 Wright stops work to eat his '{BAGIN}'
 -This is a local word for the         
{mid-morning snack}(the farmer having  
 carried his flask of tea &amp; sandwiches 
 out to the fields with him).          
   At lunch time, it is back to the    
 farm house where his wife has prepared
 a{hot lunch}- he hopes it is his      
 favourite meal of steak and mushrooms 
 with onions, peas and chips.          
   After lunch, the farmer goes out to 
 the fields again until tea-time. Work 
 outside will continue until{very late 
 during the{Summer months.
