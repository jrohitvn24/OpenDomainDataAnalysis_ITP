   The headmaster is Mr McCarthy. He   
 said that to be a headmaster you need 
 to get on well with the pupils and    
 their parents. You need to persuade   
 the staff to do things right and last 
 of all you need to have an            
 understanding family. He also said    
 that two days are never the same. The 
 school has 50 teachers and 759 pupils.</content>
