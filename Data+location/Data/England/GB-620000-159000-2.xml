{    Hersden}is a mining village on the
 main A28 road from{Canterbury}to      
{Ramsgate.}Along the main road there   
 are a few shops, a newsagent, a fish  
 and chip shop and a garage. There is  
 also a police house. The houses in    
{Hersden}are all very similar, except  
 for the police house and another house
 which we thought was the chief miner's
 house.                                
     On the south side of the main road
 are{slag heaps.}Around this area we   
 found lots of wildlife like rabbits,  
 ladybirds, ants and grasshoppers;     
 there were masses of wild flowers. The
 mine closed down in 1968-69 because it
 was uneconomic. The mine has left some
 old fossils and strata samples. The   
 railway runs just below the old mine  
 and beyond that is{Stodmarsh Nature
