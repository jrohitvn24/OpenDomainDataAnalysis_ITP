		<content> Bowes(Hutchinson's Endowed)Church of  
 England Primary School's roll has     
 fallen dramatically in the last 5     
 years and could in the future be      
 threatened with closure without an    
 influx of young children into the     
 catchment area.Mickleton and Eggleston
 schools have already closed.An ageing 
 population,later marriage and a trend 
 towards smaller families all          
 contribute to this decline in         
 numbers.Any amalgamation with other   
 schools would increase the travel     
 necessary by young children some of   
 whom already live 4 or more miles from
 school. A possible solution may be the
 creation of a Federation of Primary   
 Schools to share staffing and         
 resources.Education is under threat in
 the area because of declining         
 population and inflation. Perhaps a   
 Community College would solve this.   </content>
