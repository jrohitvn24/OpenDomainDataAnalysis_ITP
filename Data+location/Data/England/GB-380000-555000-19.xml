		<title>19A Day in the Life of A.Blair</title>
		<content>  I unload the car and carry the items 
 we have bought into my storeroom .I   
 have just time to put my car away in  
 the garage when Martin dashes down to 
 tell me the dinner is ready.          
{ 21.30}Martin has just gone to bed _  
 later than usual but it is the        
 weekend.Usually on a Friday Igo to the
 Golden Lion for a couple of drinks but
 it has been a hectic day.I think I    
 will watch TV for another hour or so. 
  {22.00}Tessa my daughter decides to  
 go to bed.I get a can of beer from the
 fridge and watch TV for another hour  
 or so.Fatigue has set in;the end of   
 another hectic day.Thank goodness it  
 is another 7 days till next Friday.   
 Downstairs for the last time,check all
 the locks and alarms on the door and  
 so to bed.What did I say in my first  
 paragraph _ "stagger downstairs" _this
 time I stagger upstairs to bed!!!!!!!!</content>
