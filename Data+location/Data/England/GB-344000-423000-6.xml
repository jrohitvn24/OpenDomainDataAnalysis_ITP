		<title>06The Pram Race</title>
		<content>  One of the most well-known events    
in these parts is the pram race held   
every Good Friday Morning.             
  This event began 20 years ago and    
helps to raise money for local         
charities .This year the beneficiary   
was the Young Disabled Unit in Preston.
  Over 30 two-man teams take part in   
the race  which covers a 4 km course   
from the Walmer Bridge Inn to the      
Longton Arms and back again.           
  At each pub on the way both pusher   
and passenger,usually in fancy dress,  
must drink a pint of bitter beer.      
  Apart from prizes for the overall    
race winners there is a prize for      
Best-Dressed pram and also a Ladies'   
race .                                 
  The event is now organised by the    
Round Table.
