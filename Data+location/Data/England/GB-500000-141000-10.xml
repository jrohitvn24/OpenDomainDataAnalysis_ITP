		<content>   1985 was the Centenary year for     
 St.Catherine's School and it was      
 celebrated by a pageant based on women
 through the ages because we are a     
 girls' school. Many animals were      
 included: a cow and donkey as well as 
 horses. Two vintage cars were brought 
 in and there were fireworks. A big    
 stand was put up for the parents to   
 watch, and it was performed on three  
 days. The gym was used for make-up and
 costumes. For all the three days chaos
 reigned through the school. The Upper 
 Thirds were allowed to come in at     
 10.30 because it went on so late at   
 night. The whole thing caused great   
 excitement. The  pageant was written  
 and directed by David Clarke. The most
 spectacular scene was the Victorian   
 seaside with Queen Victoria. Everyone 
 was involved: children, teachers,     
 estate staff and some parents.        </content>
