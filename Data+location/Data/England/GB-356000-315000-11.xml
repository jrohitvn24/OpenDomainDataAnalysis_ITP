 In  High Ercall there are two main    
 private housing estates called        
 Coppice Drive and Talbot Fields. There
 are no semi_detached houses on these  
 estates, most are detached houses and 
 bungalows. There is a smaller private 
 housing estate called the             
 Gleblands. Cleveland Avenue is a      
 council estate of mainly semi_detached
 houses. In High Ercall there is also a
 small block of flats which is three   
 storeys high. In the centre of the    
 village are older houses, built out of
 brick like most houses in the         
 area. The village of Roden has an     
 estate called Marlebrook Way. These   
 Semi_detached houses are mainly       
 owned by the Co_operative  Wholesale  
 Society.
