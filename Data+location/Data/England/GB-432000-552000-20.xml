		<title>20Village Schools</title>
		<content>   The villages are served by five     
{schools:}four primary (5/11yrs) and   
 one comprehensive (11/18). All of     
 these schools belong traditionally to 
 the Lambton &amp; Hetton or Houghton area 
 of the Borough lying to the south of  
 Washington and west of Sunderland.    
   Of the primary schools one, Our Lady
 Queen of Peace School Penshaw,is{Roman
{Catholic.}The other three, Barnwell,  
 New Penshaw and Shiney Row Junior, are
 all non-denominational and feed the   
 larger Secondary School at Shiney Row.
   The last four schools took part in  
 the Project, which allowed them to    
 forge closer links with each other in 
 this co-operative study. Visits were  
 made and research undertaken in an    
 attempt to give a clear impression of 
 an area of contrasts and we hope these
 contrasts shine through to reflect an 
 area of interest and character.       </content>
