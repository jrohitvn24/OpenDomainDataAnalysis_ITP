		<content> One change that has taken place over  
 the last few years in the rural areas 
 of thius part of Norfolk has been the 
 increase inthe number of farm produce 
 shops which have grown up mainly      
 beside major roads. One such business 
 has been set up on the A47 King's Lynn
 to Norwich road in the western most   
 part of the village of East Winch.    
 This started off as roadside shop     
 selling only small amounts of a       
 limited range of locally produced farm
 produce such as corn on the cob and   
 root vegetables. However the range of 
 goods has been greatly increased to   
 include all those things normally sold
 in a greengrocers and fruiterers. This
 means that goods are now acquired from
 wholesalers as well as from the farm  
 of which the shop is a part. There is 
 also a small section selling gardening
 products.                             </content>
