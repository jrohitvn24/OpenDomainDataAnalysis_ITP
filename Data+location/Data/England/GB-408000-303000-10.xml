		<title>10Attitudes of Shenstone</title>
		<content>The attitudes of Shenstones population 
is varied but cannot be changed. We    
have asked 12 school children of       
different age groups some questions    
about Shenstone and things around us.  
The majority of people did not want    
development there. Obviously farmers   
don't want development as it would     
endanger their land. The majority of   
people use T.V more than Radio but find
both enjoyable. Most people would like 
a toy shop or a games arcade in        
Shenstone. All together most people    
like the school but do not like the    
idea of a secondry one. Also most      
people think the old people need more  
help, but some are jealous and say they
get too much attention. Most people    
like Shenstone because it is a country 
village and it has hardly any          
industrial scars.
