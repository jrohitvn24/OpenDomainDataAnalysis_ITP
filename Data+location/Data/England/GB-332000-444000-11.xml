		<content>  This particular newspaper has two    
 main offices,one in Cleveleys,and one 
 in Blackpool,where the newspaper is   
 printed. The newspaper is distributed 
 over the Fylde Coast and Over Wyre.   
 The paper has about twenty reporters  
 which are divided into three groups.  
 These groups cover a) {NORTH FYLDE, } 
 b){SOUTH FYLDE,}c){BLACKPOOL.         
   The news in the North Fylde is      
 transported to Blackpool by a{        
{"teleprinter"}(a sort of electronic   
 type-writer that prints the news on   
 paper at the head office in           
 Blackpool),or a {"copy-typist"}(a     
 person who copies what is being said  
 through the telephone).The "Gazette"  
 was connected with a free newspaper   
 called "The Leader".This was closed   
 down,but plans are being made for a   
 "re- opening".All past copies of the  
 "Gazette"are stored at Blackpool.     </content>
