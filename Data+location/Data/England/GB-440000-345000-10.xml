		<title>10LANDUSE IN LOSCOE</title>
		<content> The land surrounding Loscoe is mainly 
 residential with a small farming      
 area, and some industry. The          
 residential side of the area  includes
 most types of houses, alot of them    
 privately owned, which covers most of 
 the land. This stretches back as far  
 as the opencast site. The opencast    
 site has been there since 1981 and has
 spoilt quite alot of the landscape,   
 which has made the area not very nice 
 to live in. The dam has also been     
 affected by the opencast site, and    
 what use to be quite a nice place is  
 now very dirty. The dam itself is     
 quite large and was once the main     
 water supply for the area.The industry
 includes Rydes Pork butchers and a    
 small refuse site. Both are clean and 
 well maintained. The farmland is      
 mostly fertilised grassland with a    
 small amount of home produce.         </content>
