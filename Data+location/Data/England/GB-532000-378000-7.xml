		<content>      Approximately 75% of the land    
 surveyed is put to arable use.        
 In 1985 by far the greater part of    
 this area was used to grow wheat.     
 There were also large fields of       
 barley, a smaller amount of oats and a
 considerable amount of oil-seed rape. 
 There was also one large field of     
 peas.                                 
      One large farm in the block has  
 at the present time no permanent      
 workers but is managed, along with    
 several other farms in the county, by 
 a large company.  A gang of workers   
 from Humberside descends periodically 
 to plough, sow, spray and harvest.    
 However, plans are afoot to           
 re-establish a permanent workforce in 
 a collection of which are at the      
 moment empty and half derelict.
