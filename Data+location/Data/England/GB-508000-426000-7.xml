		<title>07SHOPPING IN HULL</title>
		<content> As part of a Geography fieldwork      
 project, we asked 10 different people 
 in the Whitefriargate shopping area 5 
 questions.  The survey took place on  
 the 6th June 1985. The five questions 
 on the shoppers questionnaire were:   
 What have you come into town for?     
 Where do you live? How did you travel 
 to the town centre? How often do you  
 come into town? and what other shops  
 would you like to see in Hull?        
 We found that people came into town to
 shop, work or to complete money       
 transactions.  They came in from North
 Hull Estate, Greatfield, Bransholme,  
 Willerby, Kirkella and one fron Leeds.
 They seemed to come into Hull quite   
 often, although some visited the town 
 less than once a month.  20% of the   
 shoppers would like more clothes      
 shops, 10% more Pubs, 10% more sports 
 shops and the other 60% didn't mind.  </content>
