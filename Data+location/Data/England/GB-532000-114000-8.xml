		<content> Laura and Naomi play with their doll  
 family in the'home corner'while Alex  
 and Sebastian play with cars;Edwin and
 Henry like to paint;John and Amy look 
 at books and Charlie makes a space    
 ship out of old boxes and cartons;    
 these are some of the children at Dit_
 chling Preschool Playgroup held in the
 pavilion on the Recreation Ground in  
 Lewes Road.Most of the 20 children on 
 the register live in Ditchling and a  
 few are from Burgess Hill.The         
 Playgroup is seen as a stepping_stone 
 for the 3 and 4 year olds before they 
 go to school; they are encouraged to  
 become a little independent,buttoning 
 their coats,washing their hands,      
 telling their "own news" and they     
 learn to hold a pencil and to use a   
 pair of scissors, to recognise shapes 
 and colours and here they make their  
 first friends.                        </content>
