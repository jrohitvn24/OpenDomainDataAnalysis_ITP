		<title>14LOCAL HISTORY IN MARSHFIELD</title>
		<content> The name bears no relation to a Marsh,
 but rather to a March or boundary. In 
 1264 a charter for a fair to be held  
 annually on 24 May and 24 October was 
 granted to Marshfield, which then     
 became a town. Horses, cattle and     
 sheep were sold.  In early days       
 the sheep were penned in what is now  
 called Sheep Fair Lane.   There were  
 street stalls by the Crown Inn.  The  
 fair was held until 1962.  An Avon    
 County Council survey set up in 1982  
 showed evidence of very early         
 occupation from the Neolithic period  
 through to the Roman period. The Fosse
 Way is still used as a modern road.   
 The Parish Church of St. Mary was     
 consecrated in 1242.  Its present     
 Perpendicular form dates from 1470; it
 was restored in 1860. There is an     
 active Society which looks at all     
 aspects of local history.             </content>
