		<title>19Wild Flowers</title>
		<content> We went to pick some flowers within a 
 few hundred yards fo the school, along
 Back Lane and on the Green in the last
 week of June l985.They were all       
 growing wild and in flower.  We       
 thought a botanist in lOO years time  
 would find our collection interesting 
 as we found over 8O types of flowers  
 and also we realized that our         
 recordings would become historical    
 evidence of flowers at the present    
 time.  Some of the flowers were:      
 cinquefoil, madder, red campion and   
 nipple-wort, spotted medick, sweet    
 briar, geranium herb robert,bush      
 vetch, porter,honeysuckle,creeping    
 buttercup, dead nettle,lesser yellow  
 trefoil,convolvulus,knapweed,grass    
 vetch,woody nightshade,yellow flag,   
 nettles, buttercups, daisies, white   
 and zig-zag clovers, etc.
