		<title>11A Day in my Life by Kathryn</title>
		<content>   On Tuesday morning I got up and put 
 my{school}uniform on, washed, went    
 downstairs and my mam had my breakfast
 ready. I ate it all up, looked out of 
 the window and saw the bus and 'me and
 my mam' threw up our hands, grabbed   
 our coats and ran out. I got on the   
 bus and came to school with Dawn.     
   When our school bell rings I go in, 
 hang up my coat, get my hymn book and 
 go into the hall for assembly. Then it
 is English until playtime and I play  
 hopscotch. Playtime lasts for 15      
 minutes. After play I go to maths. I  
 am on to book two and my mam thinks I 
 am doing very well. I have my dinner  
 at home and I go back to school on the
 1 o'clock bus.                        
   After school I have swimming lessons
 at the {Leisure Centre}and when I get 
 back I have my tea. After tea I watch 
 T.V.. I go to bed at 8 o'clock.       </content>
