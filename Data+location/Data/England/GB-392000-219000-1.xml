		<title>01SOUTH CHELTENHAM IN 1985</title>
		<content> The area that Christchurch,Warden Hill
 and St John's Schools together have   
 surveyed is the southern part of      
 Cheltenham.                           
 The area is a mixture of older housing
 and new houses,busy shopping roads and
 quite a few educational establishments
 and open spaces.South of Greatfield   
 Lane and Farmfield Road is still      
 unspoilt countryside, mainly used for 
 grazing cattle and sheep.We live in a 
 very pleasant area really with lovely 
 views of Leckhampton Hill. There are  
 good amenities such as buses,shops,   
 schools,pubs,churches and open spaces.
 There is no industry to spoil the area
 and there are very pleasant walks in  
 the parks and gardens which are kept  
 very beautiful.All interests are      
 catered for locally whatever your     
 hobby or leisure activity may be.
