		<title>17Common illnesses,Stickney.</title>
		<content> Most illnesses occur in wintertime    
 and they are either bugs in the air or
 you catch them from other people.When 
 a child has German measles,measles or 
 chickenpox,he gets covered in spots.  
 They sometimes itch.If you put        
 calamine lotion on the spots it       
 sometimes helps to stop the           
 itching.Mumps is an illness where a   
 child gets bumps on the glands on his 
 neck .Sometimes your neck goes stiff  
 and your throat hurts when you        
 swallow. Colds are the most common    
 illness,to be caught by a child.When  
 you get wet or cold you can catch a   
 cold,and also from other people.When  
 you have a cold your nose is always   
 runny,you sneeze alot,and it is a     
 good idea to carry a                  
 handkerchief.Sometimes when you have a
 cold,you get a bad cough.
