		<title>09     NEWMINSTER ABBEY</title>
		<content>   Newminster Abbey, built circa{1137} 
 to{1138}was closed in{1537}by{Henry   
{VIII.}The Abbey though small in       
 importance and power was the largest  
 in the county covering an area of{    
{26.6 acres.}It is not known exactly   
 how much land the monks owned because 
 people bequeathed land to the Abbey   
 from all over Morpeth.                
   At first the Abbey housed twelve    
 monks but the numbers fluctuated over 
 the years.These{Roman Catholic}monks  
 farmed and generally worked very      
 hard.They were not particularly strict
 but were well disciplined and punished
 for sins.                             
   Newminster was a daughter abbey of{ 
{Fountains}in Yorkshire and had two    
 daughters of its own, Pipewell and    
 Roche, both in Yorkshire.Newminster   
 Abbey was last used in 1937 for the   
 400th anniversary of its closing.     </content>
