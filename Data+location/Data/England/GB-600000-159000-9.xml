		<title>09  THE PEOPLE OF FAVERSHAM</title>
		<content> A cross-section of the people of the  
town were asked some questions about   
living in Faversham.About 75% liked it,
the majority in the 40+ age group.This 
group were also the majority who       
thought that there was enough good     
entertainment in the town and it was a 
good shopping centre.All the other age 
groups disagreed,the highest was that  
outsiders would find the town's history
interesting.Only just over half the    
people thought Faversham a tidy town.We
also asked about where people worked.  
The interviewees were asked about the  
main income earner of their family.    
About a third of them work in Faversham
&amp; another 13% in Kent.Only 8% worked in
LONDON &amp; 3% elsewhere.A massive 43% had
no main income earner through          
unemployment or retirement.Over half of
the people asked had more than one     
income earner in the family.           </content>
