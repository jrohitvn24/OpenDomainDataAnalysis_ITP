 There is a policeman who lives in the 
 police bungalow at Indian Queens.He is
 called P.C.Chris.Humpleby.He is there 
 to keep law and order in the district 
 and to help people.He also helps with 
 the traffic in the summer.If he is not
 available either P.C.Stan Christophers
 or P.C.Dave Hall,both from St.Columb, 
 will come and help.If you cannot get  
 P.C.Humpleby on the phone you have to 
 ring the police station at Newquay who
 will speak to one of the others by the
 radio.The police have a lot to do,so  
 they drive white Ford Escorts to make 
 sure they can go all around the area. 
 P.C.Dennis Stone comes into school    
 every year.He tells the children about
 the police and their work,and shows a 
 video called "Never Go with a         
 Stranger".P.C.Stone is called the     
 School Liason Officer.                </content>
