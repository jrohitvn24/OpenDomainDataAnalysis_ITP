		<title>06WOLSTONS INFORMATION SYSTEMS</title>
		<content> Wolston's main{communication}system is
 through its modern telephone exchange 
 with its up-to-date System X exchange 
 which is one of the first in British  
 Telecom's Â£6,000,000,000 digital      
 future. {Computers}are used as        
 learning aids in both the first and   
 the secondary schools. They are also  
 used by the Police as an important    
 communication with headquarters where 
 a computer control is in operation.   
 The local policeman demonstrated      
  the speed at which he could call up a
 vehicle check by this system with his 
{two-way radio}. Wolston library is    
 only open for two part-days a week but
 is well frequented as it serves other 
 local villages. The post office       
 occupies part of the local            
 haberdashery shop.{Royal Mail}is still
 distributed to other parts of the     
 country via Coventry sorting office.  </content>
