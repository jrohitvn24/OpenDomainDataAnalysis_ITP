		<title>19SCHOOL YEAR FOR 4TH YRS POEM</title>
		<content> A school year starts again            
 Autumn comes to us with rain.         
 Football starts,rounders finish       
 As the days diminish.                 
 We played five_aside football         
 At Chailey Secondary School.          
 It was fun _ we won!                  
 Then came the Area Cross Country Run. 
 Christmas is here,the play is near.   
 Introducing"Sherlock Gnome &amp; the      
               Missing Toys"           
 Acted by all the girls and boys.      
 Christmas is done;we're back at school
 A different football tournament starts
 Plus netball too.                     
 We won again,we can't seem to loose.  
 Near the end of term,some are nervous,
 As the annual tests we take.          
 But for some_its just a piece of cake.
 Easter is over,Summers on its way.    
 Here comes the Swimming Gala          
 And the Area Sports Day.              </content>
