		<content> It is 8.3Oa.m. on Saturday and I am   
 watching the'Saturday Picture'show on 
 B.B.C. television.At around 1O.3Oa.m. 
 I get dressed,go downstairs and make  
 breakfast.Now it is 11.3Oa.m. and     
 after tidying my bedroom mum and I go 
 to London to the Roman Road market or 
 to Crisp Street market.We wander among
 the stalls and do some shopping,seeing
 what bargains are available.At about  
 3p.m. we return home to watch         
 television.At 5.3O.p.m.my dad comes   
 and picks me up to go to his house in 
 Peckham.There I have a friend called  
 Nicola and we usually go to the park  
 for a while.Tea is around 7.3Op.m.    
 after which I watch more television or
 play records.Supper is at 1Op.m.when I
 have peanut butter toast and then I go
 to bed and read.
