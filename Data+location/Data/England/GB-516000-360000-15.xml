 people who are gifted in knitting,    
 embroidery,flower arranging,toymaking,
 gardening and cookery.In Woodhall     
 there is a painting for pleasure group
 who meet weekly in the Methodist      
 School room.Non painting members      
 participate in knitting, crotchet,    
 tatting, embroidery, modelling,       
 carving etc; this group holds an      
 annual exhibition when visitors come  
 from afar.The commission on any       
 paintings exhibited and sold from the 
 doctors' waiting room goes to         
 Lincolnshire Integrated Voluntary     
 Emergency Service, which equips       
 doctors and calls them to the         
 scene of road traffic accidents.      </content>
