		<title>14Smarden Village Hall</title>
		<content> Built in 1967, the hall is the centre 
 of social life in Smarden. A pleasant 
 one-storey wooden building, it stands 
 in a large car park and has a hall,   
 committee room and lounge with a      
 licensed bar. It is used for meetings,
 elections, the surgery, dinners,      
 dances &amp; parties. Plays and concerts  
 are staged here and all age groups    
 enjoy its amenities. Social life has  
 improved vastly since the hall opened,
 as formerly the school doubled        
 uneasily as the social centre.        
 Delegates from local organisations and
 elected members form the trustees who 
 manage the hall. Luckily Smarden has  
 many dedicated volunteers who take on 
 the day to day running of the hall.   
 However, rising expenses and the high 
 cost of entertainment threaten the    
 hall's viability. Its success is vital
 to social life in Smarden.            </content>
