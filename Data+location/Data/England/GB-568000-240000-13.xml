		<title>13Blois Farm and Farm House.</title>
		<content> Mr Price owns this farm.He farms 350  
 acres. He grows wheat, barley, beans, 
 peas and oil seed rape.He has got a   
 Dominator 86 Combine Harvester 5      
 Tractors , a Hedge trimmer and a crop 
 sprayer. We also saw a very old seed  
 drill. There are 9 bullocks, 5        
 chickens, some ducks and 2 peacocks.  
 Mr Price has 1 person to help him.    
 The{Farm House}is very old .Some of it
 dates from 1200. The doorways and     
 ceilings have had to be raised because
 they were too low for people today.   
 The house has been extended,leaving   
 some interior windows.We think that   
 the farm got its name from the Norman 
 owner of the land.In 12th century the 
 manor was inherited by Matilda, the   
 daughter of Count Eustace 111 of      
 Boulogne. She married{Stephen of      
{Blois.}Blois Farm lies on Blois Road.}
