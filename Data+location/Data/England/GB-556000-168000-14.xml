		<title>14DARENTH VIADUCT - S. DARENTH</title>
		<content>   The viaduct runs east-west across   
 the Darenth Valley at S. Darenth, and 
 carries two railway tracks on the line
 from London (Victoria) to Dover. It   
 consists of 10 arches, each approx. 10
 metres wide by 20 metres high above   
 water level. As one faces south, the  
 3rd and 6th arches span the Horton    
 Road and R.Darent respectively, while 
 the 8th passes over a road leading to 
 a small industrial estate. The first 3
 arches are reinforced with iron ties, 
 3 to each spandrel.                   
   The viaduct, designed by the        
 engineer Joseph Cubitts, was built in 
 1859-60 by teams of Irish 'navvies'   
 for the London, Chatham &amp; Dover Rail- 
 way. The contracters were Peto, Betts 
 &amp; Crampton. Today, the viaduct carries
 a total of 162 passenger trains, as   
 well as 3 freight trains, to and from 
 London every day.                     </content>
