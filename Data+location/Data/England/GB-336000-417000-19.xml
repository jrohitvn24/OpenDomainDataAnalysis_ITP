		<title>19Brooklyn Caravan Site</title>
		<content>  This is in Gravel Lane. There are 120
 static caravans owned mainly by people
 from all over Lancashire who come to  
 Southport for their holidays.         
     As well as the "statics", there is
 room for 100 touring caravans. These  
 come from all over the country.The    
 people do not need to go into         
 Southport as the site has many        
 facilities. In addition to the basic  
 ones - electricity, water, toilets and
 showers, - there is a shop, a club and
 a children's playground.
