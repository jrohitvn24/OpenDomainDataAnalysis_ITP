		<title>05  THE HANAU BRIDGE</title>
		<content>The river Darent has been running      
through Dartford for many years.  It   
has however only been running under the
Hanau bridge for the last five years,  
because the bridge was only built in   
1980. It is a very attractive bridge   
compared to the little stone bridge    
that was there.  When the bridge was   
completed a new stock of fresh water   
fish (trout) were released into the    
river, but sadly they have slowly      
disappeared.  This is probably due to  
the fact that it is now a very popular 
fishing spot and the pollution in the  
river.  The river has also now become a
popular home for many ducks and swans, 
and a local canoeing club use the river
early morning before school.           
The Hanau bridge was designed and      
constructed by Dr.Stuart Cox,          
A.D.W.Smith, Mrs Eva May and           
S.W.Taylor.                            </content>
