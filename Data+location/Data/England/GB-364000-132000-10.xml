		<title>10 FLOODS IN BRUTON</title>
		<content>   Bruton has made the Guiness Book    
of Records in the past because of      
unusually heavy falls of rain.1982     
proved to be the heaviest of all.      
   At 11.20 p.m. on 11th July the      
rain began to fall.At 2.00 p.m. on     
12th July the storm finally began to   
ease.The results of this rainfall      
had been tremendous.Everywhere was     
awash and under water;in some parts to 
a depth of 20 feet.The bridges were    
severely damaged and the river at a    
dangerous level.                       
    At Sexey's School,of all days the  
12th July was a major festival with    
many important people due to arrive.   
The flat roof of the Science Block and 
the tennis courts looked like black    
water swimming pools.The class-rooms   
and boarding-houses were flooded and   
everyone was involved in bailing out.  
A day to remember in "sunny" Bruton!   </content>
