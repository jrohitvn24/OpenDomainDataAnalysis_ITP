     One day my father sent me to the  
 shops to buy a packet of cigarettes   
 and my mother said that I had to get  
 some potatoes as well.I asked her if I
 could have some sweets and she said I 
 could.I told my brother that he could 
 have nothing and he told me to 'get   
 lost'.                                
    The shop was just closing when I   
 got there so I got the things and some
 chewing gum for myself.It was         
 delicious.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
