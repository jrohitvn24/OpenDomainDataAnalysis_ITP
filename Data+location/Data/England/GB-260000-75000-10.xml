 In the area there is a disused quarry 
 very near Two Bridges, although it is 
 of little significance, but may have  
 been utilised in the construction of  
 the Devonport Leat.                   
                                       
 There are several hut circles and     
 settlements in the area, but again    
 they are not of especial interest.    
 They date from the Bronze Age and the 
 Iron Age. The largest settlement is to
 be found on the slopes of Longford    
 Tor.                                  
                                       
 There are the remains of about six    
 buildings at the old gunpowder mills  
 clustered around their own small leat 
 taken from the small Cherry Brook.
