		<title>11UPHAM PLAYERS</title>
		<content>    The Upham Players is a thriving,   
 energetic and well supported Amateur  
 Dramatic Society which was founded in 
 1968. When money was needed to repair 
 the Church bells, a group of villagers
 got together to present an Old-Time   
 Music Hall. This was enjoyed so much, 
 by audience and performers alike, that
 a public meeting was held and "Upham  
 Players" formed as a result. There is 
 now a membership of about 60,         
 including several complete families.  
 Each year a pantomime is produced     
 after Christmas with the entire script
 and some of the music having been     
 written by members of the group. In   
 the Autumn there is usually a Music   
 Hall or Revue and in the Spring a full
 length play. All the productions are  
 staged in the Village Hall, where sets
 are built and scenery painted before  
 performances.                         </content>
