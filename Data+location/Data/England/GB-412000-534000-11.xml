		<content> Fir Tree is a small village which     
 stretches along the busy A68 road     
 where it joins the road from          
 Howden-Le-Wear and was originally used
 as one of the important drove-roads   
 between Scotland and England.There is 
 evidence of ancient British           
 settlements in the area.              
 Since the mid 19th.century,Fir Tree   
 housed miners working local collieries
 but these have now closed down.       
 Fir Tree now comprises of a small     
 council estate four streets,two inns, 
 a post office and a Methodist Chapel. 
 The church was originally a school    
 room.Apart from the building of       
 several private houses the village has
 hardly changed in over forty years.
