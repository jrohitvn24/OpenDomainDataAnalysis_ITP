		<content> The original main London Rd used to   
 run from Yonsea Farm (on present A20) 
 to Home Farm on a line that is now    
 shown as a non-maintained vehicular   
 right of way on the O.S. map. It is   
 now nothing more than an obscure way  
 across fields that few people know    
 about.From Home Farm it passed by the 
 main gate &amp; gate houses of Hothfield  
 Place,up Coach Drive &amp; along Cade Rd. 
 to rejoin the present A20.During the  
 late 18th C. a large pond in Hothfield
 adjacent to West Street was drained,  
 its north bank cut away &amp; dumped in   
 the field to the north.The main       
 Hothfield to Pluckley Rd, now West    
 Street,was re-routed from its line on 
 the south bank to where the north bank
 had been;terraced cottages were then  
 built where the pond had lain.Traffic 
 then was pedestrian or horse drawn.
