		<title>11Diary of Tuesday 11 June 85</title>
		<content> I started the day by taking the dog   
 for a walk. When I got home I went to 
{school.}At school we played football  
 which we did at both other breaks.    
 Then we did work on the{computer.}We  
 used the{turtle}which is a device     
 controlled through infra red from the 
 computer. After break I had write this
 diary. When we had finished dinner we 
 wrote about our houses for the        
 Domesday Survey. After that we did    
{athletics,}400 and 800 metres running.
 After running we came in. Then we went
 home. When I got home I made some     
 coconut ice. Then I watched           
 television. I went to{guides}with my  
 friend. After guides I came home and  
 had my dinner. After making a jelly   
 for Mum I went to bed.
