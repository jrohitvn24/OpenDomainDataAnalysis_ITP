		<title>14Housing in the Cowtons</title>
		<content> Most housing is owner occupied. There 
 are many farm houses and cottages, all
 differing in style and character.     
 There is a high proportion of         
 bungalows in N Cowton. Building work  
 has been carried out more recently in 
 E Cowton, where a large estate was    
 started in the early 1970's. There are
 10 Council owned houses in N Cowton,  
 and a similar number in E Cowton.     
 There are 12 Senior Citizen bungalows 
 in N Cowton, and 15 in E Cowton, some 
 of these have been rented to families.
 Building continues with a small estate
 near E Cowton school. A village plan  
 has restricted building to specific   
 areas in N Cowton. This is to avoid   
 ribbon development which has been a   
 feature of the village. Almost all of 
 the older properties in the area have 
 been modernised, and command quite    
 high prices when up for sale.         </content>
