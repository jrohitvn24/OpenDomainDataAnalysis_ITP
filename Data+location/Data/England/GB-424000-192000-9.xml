 in Britain).Most have two cars per    
 family &amp; many of the following:- auto-
 matic washing machine,dish washer,    
 freezer,refrigerator,colour television

 are centrally heated by gas,oil,coal, 
 electricity or wood;the others have   
 open fires.

 birds.Other domestic animals owned by 
 families are goats,horses and poultry.
