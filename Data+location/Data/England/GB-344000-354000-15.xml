		<content> In its heyday Broxton station employed
 a staff of 17. Before road transport  
 became established all the            
 strawberries from Farndon were        
 delivered to the station by the lorry 
 load. Also milk from the farm was     
 transported by rail to Liverpool.     
 The station premises had a cheese     
 warehouse and a coal yard, which were 
 situated between the station and the  
 A41. There was an up and down line    
 with a platform on both sides.        
 The last station master left when the 
 station closed in 1968. Also employed 
 at the station was a porter, signal   
 man and 4 lengthmen. One of the       
 lengthmen was my grandad.             
 To the Malpas side of the station was 
 a signal box and a goods crane, part  
 of  which remains in the recently     
 built picnic site which has replaced  
 the derelict station.                 </content>
