		<title>05The Peak Forest Tramway</title>
		<content> The Peak Forest Tramway is nothing but
 a shadow of what it used to be.       
 All that is left of what used to be a 
 major part of the industry of the High
 Peak is a few stone sleepers and some 
 bits and pieces of metal. Don't let me
 mislead you by saying the Tramway is  
 unused - for some people it is the    
 favourite spot for taking their dog   
 for a walk or a perfect place for a   
 stroll. Sometimes the Cub-Scouts use  
 the tramway and make a trail on it for
 the younger cubs to follow.           
    The Tramway line started at the    
 limestone quarries at Dove Holes and  
 was built to carry limestone to the   
 terminus of the Peak Forest Canal at  
 Buxworth Basin, for trans-shipment    
 into the narrowboats.
