		<title>15WHITKIRK CHURCH</title>
		<content> Whitkirk Church is the{second oldest  
{church in the city of Leeds.}A church 
 possibly existed at the time of the   
 first Domesday Survey, but the present
 building dates from the fifteenth     
 century.                              
 Records dating back to 1185 refer to a
 certain Paulinus who was probably the 
 first known vicar of the parish; so   
 this year the church is celebrating   
 its{800th anniversary.}               
 Inside Whitkirk Church is the tomb of 
 John Smeaton, the engineer, while     
 outside in a corner of the graveyard  
 is the grave of the first Mayor of    
 Leeds.                                
 Five years ago the church underwent a 
 major restoration, and the interior   
 has been restored as far as possible  
 to its original appearance.
