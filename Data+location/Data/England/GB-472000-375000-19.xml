		<content>  There is quite a wealth of cricket   
 talent amongst the villagers in the   
 area.The local branch of the N.F.U.   
 have their own cricket section which  
 plays mid-week friendly matches and   
 competes in inter regional N.F.U.     
 contests. The more serious cricket    
 is played on Saturdays.The villages of
 Milton and North Wheatley each have 2 
 teams in the Bassetlaw League and they
 attract the more expert players of the
 area.                                 
 Local rugby is catered for by the East
 Retford R.F.C. who turn out four teams
 on most Saturdays.The club has a      
 strong fixture list in Lincolnshire,  
 Notts, Yorkshire and Derbyshire. Their
 ground and clubhouse are at Ordsall.  
  The keen anglers can find good course
 fishing in the River Idle,Chesterfield
 Canal or the still waters of the      
 Dukeries Lakes.                       </content>
