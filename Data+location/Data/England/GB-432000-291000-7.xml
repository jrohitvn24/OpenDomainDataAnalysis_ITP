		<title>07A Country Walk</title>
		<content>{ Weddington Country Walk}was opened in
 1983 as part of a derelict land       
 reclamation by{Nuneaton and Bedworth  
{Borough Council,}funded by the        
{Department of the Environment.}The    
 walk is approximately one and a half  
 miles along part of the former{Ashby  
{and Nuneaton Joint Railway Line. }    
  It is a pleasant public walk,        
 informally maintained to conserve the 
 wide range of flora and fauna which   
 has become established. Careful       
 management ensures a balance of       
 species.                              
  Future plans aim to link the         
{River Anker,}canals, footpaths and    
 similar reclaimed land schemes to form
 a{'Greentrack'}or walkway through     
 Nuneaton to Bedworth.
