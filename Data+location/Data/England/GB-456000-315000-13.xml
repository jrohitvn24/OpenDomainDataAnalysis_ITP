		<title>13BROOK FARM</title>
		<content> Mr. Halmett has a dairy farm and keeps
 Fresian cows. He has one Charolet     
 bull. He owns sixty five acres and    
 rents thirty acres. He started farming
 when he was made redundant as a       
 Production Manager. He works from six 
 a.m. to seven p.m. in the Winter and  
 from five thirty to ten p.m. in the   
 Summer. He grows grass as feed for the
 animals which he converts into        
 sileage. He only supplements it with  
 cow cake. He uses Melton Market to    
 sell or to buy live stock.
