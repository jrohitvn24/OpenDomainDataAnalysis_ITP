		<content> GUN CARRIAGE CORNER took its name from
 the guns set at this strategic spot   
 during World War 1 &amp; World War 2. It  
 is situated between Blind House Lane  
 and Stone Street. The Pilgrims Way has
 been used for centuries; it is said to
 have been part of the network of      
 prehistoric trade routes before it was
 used by Pilgrims passing to and from  
 the Continent between places as far   
 apart as Glastonbury and Compostella  
 in Spain. Hempton Hill is said to have
 seen the arrest of one of the last    
 highwaymen to be hung. He had the     
 misfortune to hold up a high dignity  
 of the Church who on arrival in       
 Canterbury sent out the authorities   
 to catch him as he was hiding in a    
 house close by in a cul-de-sac known  
 then as Black Jack's Hole.
