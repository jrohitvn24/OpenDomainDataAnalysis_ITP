		<title>13A CHURCHILL PERSONALITY</title>
		<content>  1984/5 saw Oxfordshire's first woman 
 High Sheriff, Miss Judy Hutchinson of 
 Sarsden Glebe, Churchill.   Her year  
 of office was used to find out how    
 public servants served the community. 
  She visited hospitals, children's and
 old people's homes, fire and ambulance
 stations, law courts, prisons and     
 detention centres.  Prizes were       
 presented at local schools, and she   
 spoke at many clubs and institutes    
 about her year in office, and stressed
 how pleased she was to have the       
 opportunity to see all the hard work  
 people did in the community.   She    
 gave parties and garden parties at the
 Glebe, for local voluntary workers and
 one for the Riding for Disabled, and  
 British Red Cross, of which she is a  
 hard-working member.  Miss Hutchinson 
 has lived here since she was a child, 
 and has a wide variety of activities. </content>
