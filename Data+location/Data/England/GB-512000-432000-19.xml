		<content>   My name is Steven Rodriguez. I am 8 
 years old. This is what I did on a    
 recent schoolday.                     
                                       
   I got up at 8 o'clock and had my    
 breakfast. I had Weetabix with milk.  
 Then just before 9 o'clock I set off  
 for school. School starts at 8.55. Our
 teacher took the register and then we 
 did some{writing}called "Sound        
 Sense". The morning playtime is from  
 10.30 until 10.50. I played{football. 
 After play, until 12.00 we did{maths. 
   At 12.00 it is dinner time. I went  
 home for my dinner. My mother had made
 chicken pie with carrots and gravy.   
 I read my comics and played until 1.15
 and then it was time to go back to    
{school.}Afternoon{school}starts at    
 1.25. In the afternoon we did some    
 more school work.
