		<content> My house is in Hatton which is near   
 Warrington. It is in a group of houses
 but is detached. It was built around  
 the 1950's or 60's. It is quite       
 modern. It was built by a man called  
 Dale and has quite a lot of land to   
 it. It has not been converted and is  
 still exactly the same size as when it
 was built. It has 4 rooms on the      
 ground floor not including the hall.  
 Upstairs there are 5 rooms not        
 including the landing. The garage is  
 attached to the house and is a double 
 garage. In the garage we keep the     
 washing machine and the spin drier.   
 Our house is made of bricks and has   
 cavity wall insulation. It is just    
 a normal colour. We have solid fuel   
 cental heating with a heater in every 
 room. The boiler is in the kitchen    
 along with a cooker, fridge, freezer  
 and sandwich toaster.                 </content>
