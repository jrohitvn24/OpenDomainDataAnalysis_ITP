		<content>Land use in the area falls into two    
distinct types. Permanent pasture      
predominates on the wetlands alongside 
the River Trent grazed by pedigree     
Fresian dairy cattle. The bulk of the  
milk is sold fresh in nearby urban     
centres.In many places medieval strip  
patterns are clearly visible           
indicating the absence of ploughing.On 
the better drained lands away from the 
river, arable crops and improved       
pasture is typical.Sometimes the crops 
are used as fodder for dairy herds.On  
the Wychnor Estate large areas are     
given over to wheat.Hedgerows have     
been widely removed to facilitate      
modern mechanisation. The practice     
of straw burning does not seem to be   
present in the area,farmers favouring  
baling.
