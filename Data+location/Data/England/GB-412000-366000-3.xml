		<title>03MONYASH PLAYING FIELD</title>
		<content> The new{Playing Field}in Monyash was  
 opened on August 27th,1984.There are  
 two sets of swings,a climbing frame,  
 a see-saw and a slide on a mound.     
 It is situated behind the{Hobbit Inn} 
 on land rented from the owners of the 
 pub.                                  
    The Playing Field was built by a   
 committee of local people at a total  
 cost of Â£7,677.Two thirds of the money
 was obtained from an{E.E.C.Integrated 
{Rural Development Scheme}run by the   
{Peak District National Park.}There is 
 a special safety surface of play-bark 
 under the equipment which makes it    
 particularly safe.                    
    The play ground is used alot by the
 villagers and visitors, especially in 
 the summer.The children like the      
 see-saw and climbing-frame best.They  
 would like a roundabout but it is felt
 that these are too dangerous.         </content>
