 et clay to the north and dry sands to 
the south.Most people live in 3 village
Kingston Bagpuize is the largest and   
busiest.Modern estates have now swamped
the old settlement along the main road.
There are shops,clubs and societies.   
 Fyfield's recorded history began in   
956.A population   of 200 live in 65   
houses, half of which are extremely    
old. Apart from a council estate of    
24 houses built in 1948 the majority   
of the village is owned by St.         
John's College as is all of the        
surrounding land. Few are involved in  
the primary industry-agriculture.      
 Tubney has a population of about      
183. There is little social life in    
the village which consists of mainly   
large houses and people with           
businesses in and around Oxford.
