		<content> Our school serves four main areas     
 Yatton, Cleeve, Claverham and         
 Backwell.Free coaches are provided for
 pupils who live four or more miles    
 away.A school day begins at 8.50am    
 with registration, then two lessons   
 before break.Break lasts for twenty   
 minutes, during this we play hand     
 squash, slams(a variation of hand     
 squash) chat and do homework. We then 
 have two more lessons. At 12.40pm we  
 have lunch. At 1.55pm we have a 20    
 minute tutor period, although on      
 Wednesdays and Fridays there's        
 assembly. Uniform is compulsory for   
 1st _5th years, but only the 1st years
 look really neat and conventional.    
 Backwell School has modern buildings  
 scattered over a large site, with many
 trees and an enormous playing field.  
 It has a reputation for good exam     
 results and behaviour.                </content>
