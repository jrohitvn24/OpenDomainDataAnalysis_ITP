		<content>   A questionnaire sent to each of the 
 forty or so existing factories        
 revealed some surprising facts. One   
 would have expected to find a         
 considerable{workforce}resident on the
 site but analysis of the survey       
 replies showed that many operations   
 were being run by as few as five or   
 six workers. In some cases such a     
 workforce was satisfying not only a   
 U.K.{market}but also a number of      
 overseas customers as well.           
   One of the largest{employers}proved 
 to be a local printing works          
 supplying, as one of its many         
 products,a free weekly advertising    
 paper the name of which has become a  
 household word in the area. They      
 employ some one hundred and forty     
 people and far exceed any other       
 employer in the area.
