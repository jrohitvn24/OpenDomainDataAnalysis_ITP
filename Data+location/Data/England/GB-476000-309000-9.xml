		<title>09*****:The Village Hall******</title>
		<content>The village hall is a memorial for the 
first and second world war.It had to be
rebuilt in 1977 because it was fgalling
down, because the army used to have    
their meals there in the second war.   
It has a big room, a kitchen, two      
toilet, a bar, and fire exits and a    
side annex. The floor is slippery and  
is covered with wooden tiles.          
Discos, Bingo, exhibitions, youth club,
shows, Women's Institute and Old time  
dancing are held there. We do P.E.     
there and school shows. The county     
council rents it for school.           
The hall is owned by the Village Hall  
Committee.
