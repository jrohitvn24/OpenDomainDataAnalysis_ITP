 for{arable farming}The main crops are 
 wheat and peas which are grown in     
 large quantities,other crops such as  
 barley, cabbages,tomatoes and         
 cauliflower are also grown.

 graze on the{rough grazing land.}The  
 lambs are slaughtered and sold on the 
 Island.

 area is{dairy farming.}The main breed
