		<title>10FARMING - GENERAL</title>
		<content> We live in a farming community - the  
 majority of the farms are owned by the
 Wiltshire County Council. In Keevil,  
 the 80-acre Longleaze Farm is owned   
 and run by the third generation of    
 Banfield's, Mr James Banfield and his 
 family, and consists of 60 dairy cows 
 in milk, with 20 calves a year.       
 Although they have no crops, there is 
 corn and kale grown in the area.      
 In Bulkington, there are 9 farms, each
 employing about 2 workers, but the    
 majority of workers on farms are      
 members of the family. 5 of the farms 
 are dairy, 1 is a pig farm, 1 is      
 arable,sheep &amp; beef,and 2 are poultry.
 Many farmers in the area have been    
 adversely affected by the recent EEC  
 regulations concerning milk production
 This has caused some disillusionment  
 amongst young farmers with regard to  
 the future of the industry.           </content>
