		<title>13BOYTON HALL FARM</title>
		<content> Boyton Hall has 1500 acres and a small
 work force of 9(6 on the land and 3   
 looking after the pigs.) All the crops
 are arable, they are,                 
 wheat,potatoes,peas,barley and sugar  
 beet. These are grown in fifty fields.
 The sowing and harvesting are the most
 important times of the year.Normal    
 working times are from 7a.m. to 6p.m. 
 though during harvest time it lasts   
 from 7a.m. to 9p.m.However the new    
 technology of combine harvesters ,8   
 tractors and 2 fork lifters help. When
 the harvest is all in the potatoes go 
 to London, the wheat to the mills,    
 barley into beer,peas are canned and  
 sent to the shop and the pigs are sent
 to the markets.                       
 The family who own the farm have lived
 there 39 years but have only owned it 
 2 years.
