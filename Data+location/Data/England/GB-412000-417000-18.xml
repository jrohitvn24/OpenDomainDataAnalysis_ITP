		<content> My friend Michelle and I interviewed  
 my Aunt Alice.From first moving to    
 to Fartown the look of the houses has 
 changed.  Some are scruffy and some   
 neat.  The same with the gardens.  She
 said that there used to be            
 competitions for the neatest gardens, 
 so people kept their gardens neat and 
 tidy.  The banking which used to be a 
 train track was clean with no rubbish 
 on it,as it has now.  The field had   
 railings round it but in Wartime these
 were taken down because soldiers had  
 to cross fields unseen.  She said     
 there were more houses now than when  
 she came and the trees had grown a    
 lot.  She said she preferred Fartown  
 forty seven years ago because people  
 were friendlier and the place was     
 neater.  Boats used to go along the   
 Canal.  Now it is all weeds.
