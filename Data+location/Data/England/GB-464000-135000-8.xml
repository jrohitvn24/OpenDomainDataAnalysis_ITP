		<content>       The Green named in the Tithe map
 of 1845 as "The Down" covers an area  
 of 11.812 acres. Originally  owned by 
 the Church Commissioners it was leased
 at an annual cost of 5/-! (25p). In   
 July 1955 the Parish Council purchased
 it outright, together with other land 
 for a total of what was then Â£20.     
                                       
       In 1958 a Royal Commission into 
 the state of Common and Village       
 Greens, recommended amongst other     
 things that there should be a register
 maintained of all such land to        
 preserve it for the future. As a      
 result, the Commons Registration Act  
 of 1965 came into being, whereby all  
 Commons and Village Greens needed to  
 be Registered if they were to be      
 preserved for the future "enjoyment of
 air, exercise and recreation" by      
 residents.               /cont. page 9</content>
