		<title>01Welshcroft Hill :Banbury</title>
		<content>Welshcroft Hill is about 150 m. above  
sea-level. It is used for rough grazing
land. On the top of the hill there is a
{circle of trees} that look like they  
were used for some sort of {magical    
dance}. There are also some new fir    
trees that are about 1 metre high.     
There is a {public footpath} over the  
hill, but to get to it you have to     
climb over an old stile.               
  It had a very strange shape as it was
steeper one side than the other. It is 
the sort of place where, if there were 
such things, fairies would live.       
It a very bumpy hill, and the bumps    
look like tiny houses. I would love to 
visit it on a still and snowy winter's 
night and sit amongst the trees        
 reaming of strange, weird lands and   
people.
