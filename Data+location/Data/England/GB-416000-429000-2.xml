		<title>02Industry In South Bradford.</title>
		<content> The traditional industries of{wool and
{textiles}have declined dramatically in
 our area.Even{farming}in the southern 
 half of the area is in decline and    
 much of this land is in an overgrown  
 and unused state.The old industries   
 have been replaced by small companies 
 involved in{light engineering}or{high}
{technology}related to{computers}or the
{aero-space.}One new industry has      
 appeared because of the demolition of 
 the old mills and back to back        
 houses.{Stone dressing}and the resale 
 of the stone is now one of the more   
 obvious industries in our block.Much  
 of this stone is used to build luxury 
 houses all over the country.Bradford's
 new industrial estate is well         
 situated,being next to the M606 but it
 has not attracted as many companies as
 expected and new factories are still  
 being built in the city.              </content>
