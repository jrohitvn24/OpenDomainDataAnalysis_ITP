  The sports centre has its own        
 Council which organises Amesbury      
 Carnival and the annual Fifteen Mile  
 Road Race.                            
  In the daytime the centre is used by 
 Stonehenge Comprehensive School and in
 the evenings and at weekends it is    
 open to the public.Last year it       
 catered for 11,576 people and there   
 were 385 telephone enquiries in       
 February alone.                       
  There is a coffee lounge and a       
 licensed bar overlooking the squash   
 courts.The centre is closed for only  
 three weeks in the summer for repairs 
 and maintenance. All the facilities   
 may be hired for private functions.
