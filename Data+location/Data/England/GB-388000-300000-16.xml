		<title>16PENDEFORD &amp; DOVECOTES ESTATE</title>
		<content> The Dovecote Estate was built by the  
Local Authority, work starting in 1978,
on the former Barnhurst Farm. The      
estate is named after the dovecote     
which though now derelict is still to  
be found on the estate. The connection 
with farming is also reflected in the  
street names.                          
 The numbering of the houses takes into
account the superstition that 13 is    
unlucky, no number 13 houses are to be 
found on the estate.                   
 The Shropshire Union Canal forms a    
physical barrier between this public   
housing and the private Pendeford      
Estate. Built on the former            
Wolverhampton Municipal Airport the    
Pendeford Estate has been developed by 
six private companies to give a        
variety of housing types. The Local    
Authority has retained a small area of 
the land for Local Authority housing.  </content>
