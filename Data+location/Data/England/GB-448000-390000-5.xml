		<content>{ Mrs.Wadsworth told us about what     
{happens if the Health Centre cannot   
{cope}When you first go in Hospital the
 first person you see is a Consultant, 
 or a Specialist. In the Hospital there
 are a lot of jobs for Nurses to do and
 these are two of them: making beds and
 feeding patients. A Physiotherapist is
 a person that gives us exercises. A   
 man who pushs patients to an operating
 theatre on a trolley is called a      
 Porter.{The National Health Scheme    
{started in 1948 .}The special photos  
 are called an Xray. Mrs Wadsworth was 
 in Hospital and she had to have an    
 Xray so they gave her a drink and she 
 called it Strawberry Milk Shake and   
 they took an X_ray. Laboratories test 
 blood and swabs. A person called a    
 Surgeon does the operation.           
 Psychologists sort out peoples        
 behaviour.                            </content>
