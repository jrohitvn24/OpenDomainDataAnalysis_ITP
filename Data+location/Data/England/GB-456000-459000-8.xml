		<title>08NEWLANDS FARM</title>
		<content>  The area is very flat, consisting    
 mainly of arable farmland. Crops that 
 have been grown are wheat, barley and 
 oil seed rape. .all the fields are    
 bordered by well-established hedges,  
 mostly of hawthorn, with some larger  
 deciduous trees.                      
 There is one farm in the area, called 
 Newlands Farm. It has a mixture of    
 arable land and pasture land. There   
 were beef cattle grazing in some of   
 the fields.                           
 There is a small area of deciduous    
 woodland in the south-west corner of  
 the area. The woodland area is        
 bordered by a footpath which joins the
 track leading to Newlands Farm.       
 The area is crossed by electric       
 pylons.
