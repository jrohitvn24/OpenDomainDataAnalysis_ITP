		<content> The Eastern half of the area is       
 relatively flat and devoid of any     
 striking natural features. The Western
 area is deeply disected by the West   
 Dart River, running North-South       
 between Beardown Tors and Littaford   
 Tors; the sides of the valley are     
 covered by light clitter. To the East 
 is the ancient Wistman's Wood, and to 
 the West is the slope of Beardown Hill
 contoured by the Devonport Leat.      
                                       
 The land to the South of the road is  
 almost wholly given over to enclosed  
 rough grazing in contrast to the      
 Northern area which is natural open   
 moorland.                             
                                       
 One small forest plantation has been  
 developed on the Southern slope of    
 Beardown Hill, just North of Two      
 Bridges.                              </content>
