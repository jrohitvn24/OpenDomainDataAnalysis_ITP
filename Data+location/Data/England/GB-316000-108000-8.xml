		<title>08SMEATHARPE-THE RESIDENTS</title>
		<content> The population of Smeatharpe is made  
 up of residents of long-standing,     
 their children and grand-children;    
 senior citizens who have moved from   
 other areas to retire here; and in-   
 creasingly, young families from other 
 parts of the country.                 
 There is no poor housing and at the   
 same time there are no grand houses,  
 which help towards breaking down      
 social barriers.                      
 There is little unemployment in the   
 village. Occupations are broken down  
 thus: 7 people in the building        
 industry; 8 in farming; 2 college     
 lecturers; 2 civil servants; 1 comp-  
 uter consultant; 2 small holders; 1   
 jeweller; 2 airport workers; 1 nanny; 
 1 nurseryman; 1 domestic cleaner; and 
 5 women in a variety of part-time     
 occupations.                          
                                       </content>
