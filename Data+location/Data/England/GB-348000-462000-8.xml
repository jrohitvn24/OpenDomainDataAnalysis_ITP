		<title>08EDUCATION-FALLING ROLLS</title>
		<content>  The second problem involes falling   
pupil numbers, and is one which is     
common to most L.E.A.'s. The retention 
of selection at 11+ ensures full capac-
ity at the grammar schools. Many       
parents whose children fail 11+ send   
them to areas outside Lancaster where  
comprehensive schools are available,   
mainly Morecambe Carnforth, and        
Garstang. So the problem of falling    
rolls is greatly exacerbated by the    
selective system. In Lancaster two of  
the three secondary moderns have been  
severely affected. The Castle          
secondary school purpose built as a 6  
form entry comprehensive,will have     
about 60 new pupiles in September      
1985,or one third of it's potential    
intake. Proposals this year to merge   
Castle and Greaves school on a new     
site were vetoed by Sir Keith Joseph   
(Minister for Ed. &amp; Sc).               </content>
