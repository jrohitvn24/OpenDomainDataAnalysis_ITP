		<title>03THE VILLAGE OF THORNSETT</title>
		<content> When you come in to Thornsett it is a 
 little  village with one post Office. 
 There is a school there which is over 
 a 100 years old. As you pass the      
 school there are lots and lots of     
 fields and down at the bottom of some 
 of the fields there is a stream which 
 is called Golden Springs.It is quite  
 stoney. Up from the stream there is a 
 farm it has kennels. Near the farm is 
 a wood it is called Wimberry wood,    
 there is a house in the middle of the 
 wood. Down Aspenshaw Rd you come to a 
 little cobbled path called Doctors End
 because there used to be a row of     
 houses there,and at the end house     
 lived a Doctor. Now there are         
 daffodils that Thornsett School       
 planted two years ago.Along the road  
 past Pump row is a pub called the     
 Printers Arms and Thornsett bandroom.
