		<title>17Wormleighton Parish Church</title>
		<content> The Church which is dedicated to St.  
 Peter, dates from the early 12th      
 century. There are traces of that     
 period in the nave. Early in the 13th 
 century the tower and aisles were     
 built and the chancel rebuilt. In the 
 15th century the nave roof was raised 
 to permit the building of the         
 clerestory. There is a noteworthy     
 chancel screen of the same period and 
 several hatchments on the west wall of
 the nave which probably date from the 
 early 17th century. Today the church  
 belongs to a multiple benefice which  
 includes Priors Hardwick, Priors      
 Marston, Fenny Compton and Avon       
 Dassett. In spite of this there are   
 services every two weeks alternately  
 Holy Communion and Matins, and a joint
 service with Priors Marston or Priors 
 Hardwick is held on the fifth Sunday. 
 The attendance averages 10 or 12.     </content>
