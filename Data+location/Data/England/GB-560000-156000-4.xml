		<title>04ROADS IN BOROUGH GREEN</title>
		<content>   The High Street at {Borough Green}  
used to be a {toll road} and there used
to be a {toll} house.The {toll road} is
made up of the High Street, Wrotham    
Road and the Maidstone Road.The {toll} 
house closed in 1870.                  
   Today {Borough Green} has 17 miles  
of road.The estates of Fairfield,      
Annett's Hall and Woodlands have roads 
built in a circuit.Most of the time    
these roads are very quiet.            
  The old {toll road}, Sevenoaks Road, 
Western Road and Rock Road are the     
busiest roads. They are very busy and  
normally have cars and lorries parked  
on both sides.                         
   The roads in {Borough Green} are    
always dirty and people drop  litter.
