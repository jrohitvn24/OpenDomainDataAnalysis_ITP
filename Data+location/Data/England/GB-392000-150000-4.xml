		<content> There are four barrows on the slopes  
 of Edington Down and one each on      
 Tenantry Down and Coulston Down. The  
 long barrow on Tinhead Hill was       
 excavated in the eighteenth century   
 and beeches planted on it. The        
 boundary between Bratton and Edington 
 was marked by four stones.The original
 ones were described in a charter of   
 968 AD,they were replaced in l575, two
 remain today. The boundary still      
 goes in a straight line south to      
 Scalland Cross on the Imber Road at   
 the edge of the block. The stone in   
 Luccombe Bottom supposedly marks the  
 spot where King Alfred ordered Danish 
 prisoners to be killed in 878AD. In   
 l955, when watercress beds were dug,  
 skeletons were found lying face down  
 with their hands tied behind them.    
 Historians think the site of the      
 Battle of Ethandune is hereabouts.    </content>
