		<content>  The London Midland Railway used to   
 run through Stanbridgeford Station but
 was closed in 1963 by the Beeching    
 axe. There are two buses running      
 through Totternhoe, via Eaton Bray, to
 Aylesbury. A bus runs daily to        
 Leighton Buzzard through Stanbridge   
 and Tilsworth from the A5 and from    
 Luton through Totternhoe, Stanbridge  
 and Tilsworth to Leighton Buzzard on  
 market days. As the bus service is not
 comprehensive the majority of people  
 rely heavily on private transport ie  
 cars, motor cycles and bicycles.      
 Outings are usually made by coach as  
 the nearest railway stations are at   
 Leighton Buzzard, Cheddington, Tring  
 and Luton.                            
  Luton Airport fairly close by is     
 available for air travel abroad.
