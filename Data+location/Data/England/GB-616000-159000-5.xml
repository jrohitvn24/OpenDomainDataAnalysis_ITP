		<content>    My first lesson was double maths . 
My second was english and my third was 
Geography. My fourth lesson was needle 
work which I had for all of the        
afternoon. At breaktime I went back to 
my classroom. For lunch I had 1        
sandwich, an apple and a chocolate     
biscuit. I got home at 3.42pm. Before  
tea I did my homework. For tea, I ate  
a "daisy egg salad", which I ate at    
6.13pm. After eating I did my paper    
round and read a piece from "THE       
GROWING PAINS OF ADRIAN MOLE"by Sue    
Townsend.                              
 My name is Alan Jarvis and I am in 4A.
At 7.26 am. I got up and had a         
breakfast of 2 weetabix and fruit and  
 fibre. At 8.35 I left for school and  
arrived at 8.50 pm. I travel to school 
and back by car. At home I played with 
my  brother. Then had tea and then     
played tennis &amp; watched television.    </content>
