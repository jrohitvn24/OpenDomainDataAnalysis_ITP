		<title>05Caving around Ingleton</title>
		<content> The Ingleton, Horton-in_Ribbesdale    
 and Settle areas must see hundreds of 
 people in both summer and winter.     
 Compared with other sports and pass-  
 times very few people die whilst      
 caving. Actual fatalities can only by 
 measured over long period of          
 years.There are 170  people in the    
 cave rescue team.The Yorkshire Dales  
 have some of the best and wettest     
 potholes in the British Isles and are 
 too numerous to count. Mr Bond first  
 joined the rescue team 17 years ago in
 Burnley.The rescue team has two land  
 Rovers with emergency trailers.These  
 contain first aid equipment,ropes,    
 stretchers,ladders,climbing equipment 
 and marker flares.Some of the         
 equipment lets the  patient help them-
 selves.Serious incidents have occured 
 in the past.Some times these incidents
 are not as serious as they seem.      </content>
