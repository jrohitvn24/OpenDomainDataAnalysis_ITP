		<title>01THE CHANGING FACE OF ACLE</title>
		<content> ACLE IS A MARKET TOWN OF ABOUT        
 2000 PEOPLE SITUATED ON A LOW CHALK   
 RIDGE,OVERLOOKING TO THE EAST THE FLAT
 PLAIN OF THE RIVERS BURE AND YARE.    
 THIRTY YEARS AGO THIS AREA WAS GRAZING
 MARSH AND REED SWAMPS,VIRTUALLY       
 UNCHANGED SINCE THE SEVENTEENTH       
 CENTURY.NOW MODERN DRAINAGE METHODS   
 AND GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES HAVE BROUGHT 
 MANY ACRES UNDER THE PLOUGH,THE CHIEF 
 CROPS BEING CEREALS AND BEET.SOME     
 GRAZING OF SHEEP AND CATTLE STILL     
 OCCURS,BUT THE CHARACTER OF THE AREA  
 IS CHANGING RAPIDILY.ALTHOUGH A       
 DESIGNATED "AREA OF OUTSTANDING       
 NATURAL INTEREST"MANY SPECIES OF PLANT
 AND ANIMAL ARE UNDER THREAT,AND THIS, 
 PLUS THE PROJECTED 1986 BY_PASS ,ARE  
 MAIN TOPICS OF LOCAL CONVERSATION.BOTH
 HERE AND IN THE VILLAGE OF STOKESBY   
 FEWER PEOPLE NOW WORK ON THE LAND,MOST
 COMMUTING TO NORWICH OR YARMOUTH.     </content>
