		<title>17BEXHILL HOSPITAL AND HEALTH</title>
		<content>    The hospital was built in{1932}by  
 contributions from{Bexhill citizens   
 who saved "a mile of pennies" or who  
 bought a family brick for the cost of 
 a penny. It is situated near{Old Town.
 When it opened it catered for all     
 aspects of medicine and surgery, as   
 well as{emergencies,}but today the    
 latter{must go over to Hastings}and   
 there is{no}longer a{maternity unit,  
 although there is an{Out Patients     
{Department}for all ages.              
    Much of the hospital is now used   
 for the{general care of the elderly,  
 who form a large part of our          
 population. A special{Day Hospital    
 Unit was added in 1974 to help with   
 the increasing numbers of weekly      
 therapy and rehabilitation cases.{GPs 
 are{responsible for patients}in the   
 medical wards. Admissions are often   
 made to{relieve families}for a while. </content>
