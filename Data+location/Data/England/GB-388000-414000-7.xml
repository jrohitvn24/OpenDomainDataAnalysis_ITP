		<title>07THRUM HALL ESTATE</title>
		<content> About four years ago a new estate was 
 built at the bottom of Thrum Hall     
 Lane.   Before that it was all        
 fields and the farmers used to        
 graze their cattle there.             
 Lots of people live there now.        
 It is a very popular estate.   There  
 are many different types of dwelling. 
 Quite a few of these are bungalows,   
 some are detached houses but the      
 majority are semi-detached houses.    
  Before the estate was built by the   
 Barratt building company there was no 
 road to the bottom of Thrum Hall Lane.
 There was only a cobbled lane which   
 led on to a street coming off Bentley 
 Street.  There is a new church on     
 Thrum Hall Lane and a Middle School   
 was also built just before the estate 
 was started.                          
                                       
                                       </content>
