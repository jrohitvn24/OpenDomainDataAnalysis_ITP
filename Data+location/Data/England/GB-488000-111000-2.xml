		<title>02Home Life in the Villages</title>
		<content> The home life of today's housewife in 
 the country villages is very different
 from that of her counterpart of 50    
 years ago. All the houses have mains  
 water supply and electricity. They all
 have bathrooms and a modern kitchen,  
 where equipment usually includes an   
 electric cooker, washing machines,    
 food mixers, electric kettles and     
 irons are common. Fridges are very    
 necessary and freezers for the storage
 of surplus garden produce.            
                                       
 Open fires are still very popular     
 because there is plenty of wood       
 available locally for fuel, 75 percent
 of the homes have a telephone, which  
 is the major form of communication.   
 Radios, record players &amp; TV sets form 
 the entertainment in most homes. Video
 Recorders are popular with younger    
 families.                             </content>
