		<title>11THE MOTORWAY</title>
		<content> On one of our Domesday Survey walks,  
 some people interviewed a motorway    
 worker.The motorway workers are       
 working on the new M42 motorway.The   
 M42 will be linked to the M5.It has   
 taken about two and a half years to   
 build.                                
    It is supposed to be ready for     
 August 1985,because they have now     
 completed painting the white lines,and
 have only the 'cats eyes'to insert.   
   It is roughly fourteen miles long,  
 and over two million pounds has been  
 spent on just the Umberslade section. 
   The opening of this new section,    
 bringing the link_up with the M5,will 
 bring many changes to this area.      
 Travelling to the South will be much  
 easier for both business and pleasure.
