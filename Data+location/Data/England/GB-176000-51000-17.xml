		<title>17Flora Dancing.</title>
		<content> I have been doing flora dancing for   
 three years now.In these three years I
 have always danced the part of a      
 boy.This is because there are not     
 enough boys willing to join in because
 they think that dancing is a girlish  
 activity.I practise dancing at        
 Goonhavern School with the headmaster 
 and other children at lunch times and 
 during any free time that we manage to
 get.We dance to entertain the visiters
 at Newquay and Perranporth and        
 anywhere else that they happen to     
 be.The flora dance originated from the
 Furry dance which was performed in    
 days gone by to greet the summer      
 flowers.Today it is much more         
 commercial and we collect money from  
 the tourists to boost the organising  
 band which puts it to the 1900 week   
 where a lot of free entertainment is  
 provided for everybody.               </content>
