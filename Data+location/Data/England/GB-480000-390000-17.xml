		<content>   In 1985 the car is our main form of 
 transportation.Buses are for people   
 who don't own cars or motor-bikes.You 
 pay the driver some money and he will 
 take you to anywhere on his route.Most
 families own cars or some form of     
 transport but some just walk.If there 
 is no bus service to the place that   
 you want to go,you can call a taxi.The
 driver will take you where you want to
 go,and will charge you according to   
 the distance.Many people in our area  
 own bicycles because it is flat,and   
 they use no fuel.                     
   For long distances,there are        
 trains,which are powered by diesel or 
 electricity.They run on steel rails at
 speeds of up to 125m.p.h.There are two
 stations in Gainsborough.Lea Road is  
 the main one.Very few trains stop at  
 the Central Station.
