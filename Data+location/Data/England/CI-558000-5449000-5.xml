		<title>05FREEDOM SURFBOARD FACTORY</title>
		<content> The Freedom Surfboard factory at Coin 
 Varin is the biggest and one of the   
 best in Europe. Paul Russell, one of  
 the best surfers in the UK, uses      
 Freedom surfboards and so do the      
 French team. The first stage in the   
 making of a surfboard is the making of
 the foam blank. This is done by       
 pouring polyurethene in liquid form   
 into a concrete mould which is the    
 shape of a fat surfboard to give room 
 to be shaped. Next the board is       
 hand-shaped with an electric plane.   
 The blank is then laminated with      
 polyester resin and glass cloth and   
 the fin is attached. A filler coat of 
 resin is then applied to each side.   
 The board is then sanded all over. A  
 gloss coat of thinned resin is applied
 to each side and finally the board is 
 rubbed down with wet/dry sandpaper and
 polished.                             </content>
