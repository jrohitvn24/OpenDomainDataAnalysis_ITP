		<title>04CORNBURY PARK RACING STUD</title>
		<content> The Cornbury {Bloodstock Stud }was    
 founded in l967. There are currently 9
 brood mares with foals and 5 maiden or
 barren. They breed progeny to race    
 under the Owner's colours. {Yearlings 
  are trained for {flat racing}, proven
{fillies}return to stud as {brood mares
  and kept until aged 15 to 20, foaling
 every year. To prevent the spread of  
{Contagious Equine Metritis} the mares 
 actually foal away at the stud where  
 the stallion who will cover them next 
 is standing. Swab tests for clearance 
 are taken before leaving Cornbury,    
 after foaling and before covering.    
 They go to well-known {stallions} and 
 are covered during the foaling heat or
 the next 5 wks later. 50ha of{pad-    
{docks} at Cornbury provide {grazing   
{and hay. Bran and home-grown oats} fed
 too. There is {stabling} for {40}. The
 Stud employs {4 full time staff}.     </content>
