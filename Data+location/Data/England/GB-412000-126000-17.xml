		<title>17FARMING SOUTH OF SALISBURY</title>
		<content> Farms in the area specialise in arable
 and livestock. Beef production and    
 dairying are important. Some fields   
 are used for arable whilst others are 
 used for permanent and temporary      
 grazing. Lucerne is grown for cattle  
 feed. Bridge Farm at Britford         
 specialises in beef_farming. It also  
 produces wheat, winter_barley,        
 spring_barley, and oats. It is worked 
 by 5 men with 3 tractors. The River   
 Avon is an important source of water  
 for its livestock. The level of the   
 water has to be carefully watched as  
 it varies greatly in summer. There are
 problems of access across the main    
 Salisbury to Bournemouth road as well 
 as stock_worrying and vandalism by    
 dogs and people from nearby housing.
