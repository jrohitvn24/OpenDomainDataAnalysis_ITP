		<title>01Buxhall - Introduction</title>
		<content> The area covers the majority of the   
 parish of{Buxhall,}including the main 
 concentration of houses and the       
 southern extent of{Rattlesden}parish  
 known as High Town Green. Lying south 
 of the A45 20 kms east of Bury St     
 Edmunds and 8 kms west of Stowmarket  
 it is in the heart of the boulder clay
 country, known as High Suffolk. The   
 principle activity is arable farming  
 dominating its landscape and economy. 
                                       
 The area is sparsely populated and    
 appears remote from contemporary urban
 influences. It is relatively flat, at 
 its southern edge rising to           
 approximately 100m, with wide views   
 over the surrounding countryside      
 particularly from the east. In the    
 southwest are the remains of a World  
 War 2 airfield now mainly restored to 
 agriculture.                          </content>
