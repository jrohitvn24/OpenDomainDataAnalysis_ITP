		<content> CHILDREN'S PLAY PARK.                 
 THERE ARE 2 CHILDREN'S PLAY PARKS IN  
 ETTICK DRIVE. EACH HAS 2 SETS OF      
 CHILDREN'S SWINGS, A ROUNDABOUT, A    
 SLIDE, A CLIMBING FRAME WITH A LADDER 
 ATTACHMENT. THE PARK IS GRAVEL WITH   
 PAVED AREAS AROUND EACH ITEM.         
 SCATTERED AROUND THE PARK ARE THREE   
 WOODEN BENCHES WITH BACKS SO THAT     
 PARENTS MAY SIT AND WATCH THEIR       
 CHILDREN.                             
 BESIDE THE GRAVEL IS A STRETCH OF     
 GRASS WHERE CHILDREN OFTEN PLAY.      
 I THINK THE GRAVEL AND PAVING SLABS   
 HAVE DANGEROUS FEATURES-IF CHILDREN   
 FALL,AND THERE IS AN ELECTRICITY PYLON
 ON THE GRASS WITH OVERHEAD CABLES. THE
 SWINGS AND OTHER EQUIPMENT ARE QUITE  
 OFTEN MENDED BUT THERE IS GRAFFITTI   
 EVERYWHERE.
