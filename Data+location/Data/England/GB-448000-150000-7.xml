		<content>{An Employee of Portals}               
 Mr. X has been working at the Mill for
 twenty years. He is not particularly  
 contented because he thinks the pay is
 poor and his particular job, cutting  
 the paper, is boring. The Mill works a
 shift system; three every 24 hours.   
 The Mill opened in 1935. He began     
 working there when he was 15 in 1966. 
 Most of his family also work at the   
 Mill but he would not recommend it to 
 any school leaver because of          
 conditions and pay. Workers only get  
 one half hour break per shift. There  
 used to be quite a few industrial     
 accidents but since the introduction  
 of the Health and Safety legisation   
 they are now very few. There have been
 a lot of fires in the 'rag house',    
 where the wet paper or 'stuff' is     
 kept, as a result of spontaneous      
 combustion rather than carelessness.  </content>
