		<title>05A Child's View of the Police</title>
		<content>  In our police force we have the{beat 
{policeman}who patrols the streets and 
 keeps a look out, and the{C.I.D       
 department which deals in criminal    
 records and matching fingerprints and 
 investigating murders. The{traffic    
{patrol}makes sure that the traffic    
 flows smoothly without any accidents. 
 There are{doghandlers}who work with   
 dogs that can help track people, sniff
 out bombs, explosives and drugs. The  
{mounted branch}ride on horses and keep
 peace at football matches and         
 demonstrations.                       
  If we didn't have police our country 
 would be unsafe to live in. They also 
 make sure criminals are brought to    
 justice. When a criminal is caught for
 stealing he is taken to a{magistrates'
{court,}for murder he would go to a    
{crown court}for trial. The police do a
 good job in keeping us safe.          </content>
