		<title>10Hamm Court Farm,Addlestone</title>
		<content> Hamm Court Farm is now given over to  
 the breeding of top class deer. There 
 are three types of deer -{Scottish Red
{Deer, Chinese Spotted Deer}and the    
 very large{Elk.                       
 Deer are kept in fields surrounded by 
 three metre high fences with an       
 electric fence about two metres high  
 and half a metre inside the large one.
 Fields are well watered because of the
 nursing females. One male serves about
 40 females.                           
 The cost of a good breeding deer is   
 about{Â£1000}and only the best are     
 kept. Ear tags identify the deer and  
 they are quite tame because they are  
 hand-fed. The farm is very pretty and 
 contains many wildfowl and game as    
 well as the deer.
