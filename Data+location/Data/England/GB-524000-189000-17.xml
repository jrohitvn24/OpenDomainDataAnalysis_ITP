		<content> Through the centre of the area runs   
 the North Circular Road, a main       
 orbital route of North London. It is a
 very heavily used road and there are  
 frequent delays due to the            
 unsuitability of the road for its use.
 There have been proposals put forward 
 for many years now that wish to widen 
 the road from a single lane in each   
 direction to three lanes each way. The
 proposals have met with considerable  
 protest from local residents over such
 factors as increased lead pollution   
 and loss of land etc.                 
 A survey carried out by the children  
 of Tudor School showed that despite   
 the heavy usage a great deal of       
 traffic still cuts through the local  
 back streets often at great speed, so 
 perhaps a better NCR would be in the  
 interests of the children at the      
 school.                               </content>
