		<title>09Village Life in Cardington</title>
		<content>   When the school closed in 1984  many
 of the village people were very upset.
 The school had been  open  since 1868.
 They were worried that no new families
 with  children  would  move  into  the
 village.                              
                                       
   When we did a survey of the village,
 we asked local people  why  they liked
 living in Cardington. They all said it
 was quiet except  in  the  morning and
 evening  when  people  were  going  to
 work.                                 
                                       
   If  they  owned  a  car  they   were
 alright but otherwise they had to rely
 on the  hourly bus service to Bedford.
 With no  shop  in  the  village, apart
 from the post office, everyone  has to
 leave at sometime to buy food.        
                                       
                                       </content>
