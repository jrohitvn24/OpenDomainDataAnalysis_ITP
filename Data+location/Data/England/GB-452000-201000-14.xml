square with a ball.   The object is to 
keep the ball in the square as long as 
possible.   If the ball goes out of    
square,the person who touched it last  
is out.   The winner is the person who 
is  still in at the end.               
RULES:                                 
 PEOPLE MUST TRY TO KEEP THE BALL IN   
THE SQUARE. IF THEY LET IT GO THEY ARE 
OUT.WHEN YOU ARE OUT YOU MUST GO OUT OF
THE SQUARE. YOU CAN ALSO BE CAUGHT     
OUT.  SOME PEOPLE PLAY THAT THE WINNER
