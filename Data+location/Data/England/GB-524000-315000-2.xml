		<content>      Most of the working inhabitants  
 are employed in the village, others in
 Spalding and several in Peterborough. 
 Many of the families are well         
 established having lived in the area  
 for morw than ten years. In recent    
 years new housing development has     
 almost doubled the population.        
      There are slightly more women    
 than men living in the village with   
 children forming a third of the       
 population. The women prefer modern   
 appliances such as automatic washing  
 machines to twin-tubs and tend to shop
 in the nearby market town of Spalding 
 using private vehicles, which most    
 families posess; though more own pets 
 than cars.                            
      Television is the chief leisure  
 activity with gardening, visiting     
 relatives and 'Bingo' also being      
 popular.                              </content>
