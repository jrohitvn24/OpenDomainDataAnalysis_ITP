		<title>13THE VOLKS RAILWAY</title>
		<content> Volks Railway was built and designed  
 by Magnus Volk and opened on the 4th. 
 August 1883. The line was rebuilt in  
 1884 since which date a regular       
 service has run along the beach.      
 Originally the line ran from the Chain
 Pier to Paston Place. There was a     
 seashore railway to Rottingdean from  
 1896 but it had to be closed in 1900  
 due to the construction of groynes    
 into the sea. In 1901 the original    
 railway was extended to Black Rock and
 a new station built. The line was     
 shortened to facilitate the new Black 
 Rock swimming pool and the terminals  
 demolished during the second World    
 War. After the war new stations were  
 built at Black Rock and the Aquarium. 
 Magnus Volk died at the age of 82 in  
 1937 and the Council took over the    
 line in 1940. Today it runs in the    
 summer season only.                   </content>
