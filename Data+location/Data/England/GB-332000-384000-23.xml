<title>23Pollution in Rock Ferry</title>
<content>Today the River Mersey teems with fish including Salmon as all the sources of river pollution have been stopped. The marine tanker cleaning terminal at Rock Ferry Pier no longer pollutes the air with it's odorous gas discharges.  The chemical works up river have stopped dumping unwanted chemical waste into the river and it's tributaries.  Some of these now have otters in them.&#xd;
As there are no longer lead additives to petrol and lead paints there is little risk to today's school children.  There is no longer playground risks as the school in The Dell. Rock Ferry has been closed and demolished with the ground prepared for building.
