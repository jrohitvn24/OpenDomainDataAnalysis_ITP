caught on the main road. Coaches take  
secondary school children to and from  
schools in Didcot.                     
  There are 2 postal collections and   
deliveries each day except Sundays.    
There is a daily milk delivery.        
  The major single employer locally is 
the United Kingdom Atomic Energy       
Authority.The Director,Dr.Lewis Roberts
lives in the village.Many people       
commute to work by road or by Didcot   
Parkway's excellent train service.

horse training establishment,an orchid 
nursery,a general store,a garden centre
