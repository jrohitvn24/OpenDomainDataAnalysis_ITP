		<title>04Traffic through Kingsley</title>
		<content>  The main road through Kingsley is    
very busy. It is called the A52 and it 
goes from Hanley to Ashbourne. It used 
to be one of the roughest roads in     
Britain until a couple of months ago   
when a new one was laid down. It has no
Pelican crossing and is therefore very 
dangerous for pedestrians.             
  New street lamps were put in so that 
it would be easier for people to see   
where they were going at night.        
  There are a lot of heavy vehicles    
which carry sand and limestone from    
Cauldon Low quarries. Every morning    
wagons go thundering past, especially  
Tideswell's and Tarmac. Kingsley has   
no traffic lights which mean drivers   
have to be careful. In summer time the 
road is used by a lot of people who    
are going to Alton Towers pleasure     
park.
