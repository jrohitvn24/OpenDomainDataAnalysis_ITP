		<content> Charlton's Pond used to be Cowpen     
 Brickworks  but somuch clay was dug   
 out that it flooded. William Charlton 
 leased the pond and stocked it with   
 250 Lochleven trout and fished it with
 his friends. In 1968 Charlton's Pond  
 was made a nature reserve. Altogether 
 112 different kinds of birds have been
 seen there. The habitat for the       
 birds is water surrounded by hawthorn 
 and elder bushes which provide food   
 for wintering thrushes from           
 Scandinavia. The eastern end is fenced
 off to protect breeding birds. There  
 are lots of ducks, moorhens, 2 swans  
 and mallards. In the pond are carp,   
 tench,minnow and stickleback. Many    
 local people like to fish at the pond 
 because it is well stocked and easy to
 get at.
