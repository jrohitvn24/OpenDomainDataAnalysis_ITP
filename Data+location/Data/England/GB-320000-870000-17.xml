		<title>17LYNDSEY'S DAY</title>
		<content> My alarm clock wakes me at 7.20a.m.   
 When I rise I stroll through to the   
 kitchen to eat a breakfast of cereal  
 and milk.After breakfast,I dress in a 
 white blouse,yellow,red and black tie,
 a grey skirt and grey "tank top".I    
 make my way to the bathroom to wash my
 face and hands and to clean my teeth. 
 I don my summer anorak and walk to    
 school where I meet my friend.We are  
 ble to chat for a few minutes before  
 the bell summons us to our classrooms 
 at 8.55a.m.The morning proceeds as    
 James has described it.After lunch I  
 play skipping,"tig"and"hide and       
 seek"until I return to my class again 
 at 1.30p.m.After school,I change into 
 old trousers and sweater before       
 working on any homework or piano      
 practice.I have a light snack of      
 biscuits,cheese and milk,before       
 venturing out on my{"Roller-Boots".}  </content>
