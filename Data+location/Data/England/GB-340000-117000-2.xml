		<title>02Our House.</title>
		<content> Our house is made of stone and has a  
 slate roof. We have four bedrooms and 
 two bathrooms upstairs and another    
 bedroom, a lounge, toilet, living room
 and kitchen downstairs. We have       
 a colour television and a portable    
 television that we use with the       
 computer. We have not got a video yet.
 In the kitchen we have a fridge,      
 electic cooker, washing machine and   
 the boiler for the central heating.   
 Our heating works by coal because     
 there is no gas in the village. The   
 deep freeze is in the workshop, we    
 have two garages and a bike shed. The 
 garden is nice and big to play in. We 
 can ride our bikes all round the      
 house. Up by the apple trees is the   
 caravan that we are going to take on  
 holiday. If the whole family goes we  
 will take a tent too. The room we use 
 most is the living room.              </content>
