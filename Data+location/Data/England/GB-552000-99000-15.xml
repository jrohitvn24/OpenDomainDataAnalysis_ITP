		<content> This village has a preservation order 
 on it so that it should be kept as it 
 is without visible alterations.There  
 are about 14 residential properties   
 occupied by professional people.Among 
 these are a property developer,a      
 business machine importer,a dentist, a
 market gardener,some wine cultivators,
 artists,retired ex-forestry people,a  
 doctor,educationists and a retired    
 judge.Several homes are conversions   
 from ancient flint barns.A picture of 
 the village before conversion is in   
 the British Museum.The residents do   
 not want or expect any local          
 services.They shop in Eastbourne or   
 Seaford and get medical attention     
 there.Since this hamlet falls within  
 the catchment area of Eastbourne      
 waterworks,no farm animals can be     
 kept.
