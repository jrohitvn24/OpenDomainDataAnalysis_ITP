		<content>   The Highwood Road site has long been
 used for educational purposes. The    
 main buildings are pre-war and have   
 housed a grammar school then a        
 secondary modern school, and later a  
 tutorial unit for difficult           
 adolescents.                          
   Part of the site now provides       
 community facilities for the village  
 of Brockenhurst. The rest serves three
 main functions- tutorial centre       
 catering for up to 12 youngsters      
 referred from the 4th and 5th years of
 local comprehensive schools,-one of   
 the smaller buildings houses the      
 School Psychological Service which    
 serves the South West Hampshire Area, 
 -the rest of the facilities are used  
 by the Education Development Centre,  
 which provides the focus for          
 In-service activities for local       
 schools and colleges in the area.     </content>
