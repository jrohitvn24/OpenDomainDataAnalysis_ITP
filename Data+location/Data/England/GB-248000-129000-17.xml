		<title>17THE A39 TRUNK ROAD</title>
		<content>                                       
 This is the extremely busy road which 
 passes through our grid area.  It     
 connects Bideford and Barnstaple,     
 North Devon's two largest towns.      
 Commuter traffic is heavy.  In the    
 tourist season of high summer the road
 is at its busiest carrying            
 holidaymakers to the resorts along the
 North Cornwall coast as well as more  
 locally to Westward Ho!  42 bus       
 services from North Devon Red Bus pass
 through our grid area every day.  It  
 is a dangerous road to cross and many 
 of the children come to school with a 
 parent on foot or in a car.  Some     
 children from a neighbouring village  
 come along the A39 in a taxi.
