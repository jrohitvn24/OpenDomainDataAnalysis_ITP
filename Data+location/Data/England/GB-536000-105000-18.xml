		<title>18WHERE TO SHOP IN WOODINGDEAN</title>
		<content> A typical parade of shops is brick    
 built and about thirty years old. Most
 are built like houses, with shops at  
 the bottom,and flats or maisonettes   
 above.They are in groups of three or  
 four and change hands frequently. The 
 average number in a parade is twenty. 
     Types of shops are:-              
 A supermarket, garage, bank,          
 newsagent, hairstylist, cafe,         
 woolshop, video-hire, electrical      
 goods, solicitor, greengrocer and two 
 florists.                             
     The shops in Woodingdean are      
 mainly used for odds and ends that    
 people forget to buy in the bigger    
 shops in the centre of Brighton.The   
 shops in Woodingdean are often busiest
 on Saturdays.Old age pensioners are   
 the ones who get their shopping       
 predominately in Woodingdean.
