		<content>    In 1960 the wages for a farm worker
 were three shillings a week (15 pence 
 in todays money).The farm labourer    
 today earns approximately 100 pound a 
 week.                                 
    The farm consists of  595 acres    
 only twelve of which is grass. The    
 soil types are chalk,silt and sand    
 mainly in the valleys.                
    Farming in 1985 is now very        
 technical and also very modernised.   
 One farm labourer can look after 120  
 acres. A farmer's job requires        
 dedication, and to be able to know    
 what you are doing quickly and        
 efficiently."                         
                                       
    After talking to the farm labourer 
 we have decided that his job is hard  
 and requires much determination. Most 
 workers are very loyal and have gained
 much job satisfaction.                </content>
