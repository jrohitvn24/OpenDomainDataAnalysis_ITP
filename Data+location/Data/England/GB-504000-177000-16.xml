		<title>16THE BUILDING OF THE M 25</title>
		<content> Traffic has been a major problem      
 during 1985. This is because the M 25 
 is being built from Poyle to Denham.  
 Traffic travelling between these two  
 points has to travel through          
 Harmondsworth and West Drayton to     
 Uxbridge along with airport traffic   
 travelling to and from the north. Ii  
 is also the route to which one can    
 join the M 40 and M 1. The M 4 spur   
 road into the airport has meant a     
 decline in the traffic running through
 the villages of Harmondsworth and     
 Sipson. Some local companies who      
 operate heavy vehicles like Drinkwater
 Sabey have agreed to use the M 4 spur 
 road to avoid going through the       
 village of Sipson.                    
                                       
 The peak time for congestion on the   
 roads is in the morning between 3.30  
 a.m. and 9.00 a.m.                    </content>
