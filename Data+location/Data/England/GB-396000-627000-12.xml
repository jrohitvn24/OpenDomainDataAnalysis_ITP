		<content> In September 1985 Woler First School  
 is celebrating its 25th. Anniversary. 
 The school opened on the 1.9.1960 with
 69 infants,including 40 from the      
 Church of England School - Wooler     
 County Primary School- and 16 new     
 starters.                             
   The old school used to be in the bu-
 ilding that is now the library.The new
 school was not ifficially opened until
 1962.It still did not admit 7+        
 children until 1968 when the Church of
 England School,which was sited in the 
 bus station car park,closed its doors 
 for the last time.                    
   A series of celebrations are being  
 held to mark the anniversary and a    
 Silver Jubilee Fund has been set up to
 raise money to buy computers for the  
 classrooms.
