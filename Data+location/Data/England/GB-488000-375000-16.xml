		<title>16Tourism in Saxilby Area</title>
		<content> In  summer,  look  over  the  wall  in
 Bridge  Street  and  you  will  almost
 certainly  see  several  cruisers  and
 maybe a narrow boat or 2 moored  along
 the banks of the Fossdyke. All part of
 Saxilby's  waterfront  scene (featured
 in  the  BBC2  film  The  Grain  Run).
 Boating  holiday  makers enjoy a safe,
 free berth and a chance to  visit  the
 well  stocked  shops or the pubs. They
 cruise between the  Trent  at  Torksey
 and  Brayford  Pool, Lincoln. Visitors
 can stay in a guest  house  on  Bridge
 Street.  Improved mooring and a picnic
 site is proposed  for  the  far  bank.
 There  is fishing on the Fossdyke, but
 more so on the River Till. There,  the
 charge  is  1 pound a day or fishermen
 are  members  of  a  Rotherham   club,
 living  mainly in the steel and mining
 areas of South Yorshire. There were no
 matches this year because of weed.    </content>
