		<title>19Bank House,a Mystery.</title>
		<content>  On a map we found a big house named  
 Bank House.  We set of from school at 
 Shuttlewood to find it.  First we     
 crossed the recreation ground then we 
 passed Bentinck, Lodge Farm, went     
 under the motorway bridge and over the
 Mineral railway.  When we finally got 
 to Bank House we could not find the   
 path we wanted, whichever way we went 
 we could not get through and had to   
 turn back.  In all we walked over 8   
 Kilometres when it was only 4         
 Kilometres according to the map to get
 where we wanted.                      
  When we finally got to Bank House it 
 was in ruins except for one part. When
 we rang the bell a dog barked but no  
 one answered even though the place    
 looked lived in.  Judging by the large
 stables this was once a rich persons  
 house.  By HELEN LUKE &amp; OTHERS.
