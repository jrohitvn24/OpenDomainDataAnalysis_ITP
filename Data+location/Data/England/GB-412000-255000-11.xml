		<title>11FARMING, HASELOR, WARKS.</title>
		<content> One day I went to Mr.Gray-Cheape to   
 ask him some questions about his      
 farming. Although his house is not in 
 our area for the survey he does own   
 most of the land in Haselor,so his    
 crops are grown in Haselor. He has 220
 sheep,his wife has two horses she uses
 for hunting and keeps them in the barn
 by their house. He keeps fresian      
 cattle in his barn for feeding up for 
 beef. He grows barley,wheat and beans.
 The beans are a break crop, he sells  
 some and keeps some for feeding his   
 animals. He employs a gamekeeper(see  
 page 1)to look after the pheasants and
 partridges in his woods. In the winter
 he has shooting parties and local men 
 act as his beaters. These walk across 
 the land to make the pheasants and    
 partridge fly towards the shooting    
 party. They have dogs to retrieve the 
 birds.                                </content>
