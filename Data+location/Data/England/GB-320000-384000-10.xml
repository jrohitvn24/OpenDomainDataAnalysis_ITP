		<title>10SAILING CLUB AND COASTLINE.</title>
		<content>   West Kirby Sailing club was founded 
 in 1892 and has at present 834 members
 the youngest being 10 and the eldest  
 over 80.                              
   The Sailing Club own their own boats
 which can be hired but the majority of
 members own their own craft.Members   
 sail on the Marine Lake or on the     
 Estuary.The club organises its own    
 regattas and also compete against     
 other local clubs.                    
   The coasline especially in Caldy is 
 suffering from erosion by the sea and 
 this is an issue felt by many people  
 to be of great importance.There are   
 also worries about the future of the  
 beaches as there has been a steady    
 encroachment made by Spartina Grass   
 which spreads very rapidly and alters 
 the nature of the land.Much research  
 has taken place but no solutions have 
 yet been found.                       </content>
