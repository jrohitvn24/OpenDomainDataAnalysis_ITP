The Police are based at Hatton Green   
where there is a resident policeman.   
The whole principle is village         
community policing. This means that    
the police get to know the people of   
the area and they often get to hear    
about the crime before it happens.     
The next Police Station is the one at  
Hockley Heath, this serves the         
Rowington area. There are regular      
mobile patrols.                        
The majority of "crime" is car based   
for example traffic offences on the    
A41. There are also a lot of accident  
problems on the A41. The other major   
problem is the rowdy town people in    
the country pubs.                      
The area is fairly quiet and           
effectively policed.
