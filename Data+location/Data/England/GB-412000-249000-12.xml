		<content> Originaly before the Bowling Club was 
 built there were tennis courts on the 
 site where it now stands,It was only  
 changed in 1933.                      
  Many have joined the club and there  
 are about 200 social members and at   
 least 100 bowling members(ladies &amp;    
 Gents).                               
  To become a social member you must be
 the age 18 or over.                   
  Inside there are several sports      
 including darts,skittles,pool &amp; card  
 games.                                
  As  well as an adult bowling team    
 they have a junior team  from the age 
 of 12-18 years of age.                
  The green is 40yds square and so to  
 keep it immaculate they have a        
 gardener.    By
