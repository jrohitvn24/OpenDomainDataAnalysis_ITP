		<title>09  Worlebury hill fort</title>
		<content>   The end came quickly for the hill   
 fort. It was attacked by an enemy and 
 destroyed. Many of the people were    
 killed and their belongings taken.We  
 know so much about what happened      
 because the site was excavated in the 
 nineteenth century. Pits were dug and 
 many things were found such as, tools,
 grain and bones.                      
   If you walk up there today it is    
 difficult to imagine what it must have
 been like.Trees were planted there    
 over a hundred years ago which cover  
 the remains. Today it is a pleasant   
 place for many Westoners to go for a  
 walk.
