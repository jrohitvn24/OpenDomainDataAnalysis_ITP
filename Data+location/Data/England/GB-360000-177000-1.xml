		<content> Our area is situated to the north of  
 Bristol with easy access to motorway  
 and rail networks leading to all parts
 of the country.{                      
{Filton}was a part of{Horfield}when the
 original Domesday was compiled,the    
 land being fairly unproductive.History
 tells us that both areas were lawless.
 Today both areas are largely          
 residential with a mixture of private 
 and council housing.To the east is{   
{Harry Stoke}and{Stoke Gifford}.The    
 former with its slag heaps shows      
 evidence of coalmining in the past.The
 latter is nowadays well known for     
 Parkway,an important train station,and
 is witnessing extensive housing estate
 growth.To the south east is the       
 unspoilt village of{Frenchay},a       
 conservation area of much charm with  
 wooded parkland and splendid houses   
 built in earlier times by merchants.  </content>
