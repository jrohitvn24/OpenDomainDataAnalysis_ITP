		<title>07THE FIRE STATION KNUTSFORD</title>
		<content>      The Fire Station was opened in   
 1964. It takes one minute to get ready
 to go. They have got two water tenders
 and one rescue tender. They can fit   
 six men in an engine. Their fastest   
 speed on a motorway is between 80 - 85
 miles per hour and 50 to 60 on normal 
 roads.                                
      In one year Knutsford had 800    
 fires. Some fires take three or four  
 days to put out. They get more fires  
 when children are on holiday.         
      There are twelve firemen and one 
 Chief Officer. All the equipment is   
 paid for from the rates. They keep a  
 record of all the fires. The fire     
 engine is big and the seats are hard. 
      The area covered by this station 
 is Stockton Heath, Altrincham,        
 Northwich and Holmes Chapel.
