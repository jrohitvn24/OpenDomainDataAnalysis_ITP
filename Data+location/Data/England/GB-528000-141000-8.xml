		<title>08SHOPPING IN HORLEY</title>
		<content>  Several people were interviewed in   
{Horley Town Centre.}About 30% were    
 from neighbouring towns and London.   
 Most worked locally. People approved  
 of the town centre's location and the 
 layout but wanted more department     
 stores,for more variety,specially in  
 childrens clothing and toys.Many felt 
 that Woolworths should re-open. Some  
 complained about the pavements.The    
 popular shops were - Waitrose for its 
 wide selection of foodstuff, Shoppers 
 Paradise for low prices and           
 Collingwood Batchelors for traditional
 and quality items. All three chemists 
 were popular,Cross and Herberts was   
 the oldest;Boots was favoured for its 
 prices;Savoury &amp; Moore which had      
 recently opened was modern with a wide
 selection.People felt there were too  
 many Building Societies and banks.
