		<content>  Old inhabitants of the town are not  
 convinced that the town has changed   
 for the better.There are complaints   
 about too many amusements and too much
 litter and dog dirt,especially on the 
 Promenade.Chalets and a garlanded     
 bandstand on the Prom have disappeared
 and 'diggers' or 'sandiggers' i.e.    
 holidaymakers, are blamed for the     
 dirty beach.There were once 3 cinemas 
 but none survive.Other changes noted  
 were the disappearance of a children's
 play area in favour of a compound for 
 commercial fishing boats, and the     
 filling in of the boating lake to     
 create a crazy golf course.           
  Despite an old people's home, new    
 bungalows for the elderly and         
 facilities at the community centre,   
 there is a feeling that there is not a
 lot for old people to do with more    
 done to cater for young people.       </content>
