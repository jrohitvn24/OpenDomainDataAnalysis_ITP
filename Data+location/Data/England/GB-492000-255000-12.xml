 We have lunch at l2.lO and we either  
 stay to school lunch or have          
 sandwiches. No-one goes home to lunch 
 as there are always many activities to
 take part in, such as                 
 athletics,swimming, rounders,         
 cricket,and in the winter there are   
 clubs for chess, stamps,scrabble, and 
 computers.                            
 We have an outdoor swimming pool, an  
 athletics track,and high- and         
 long-jump pits.                       
 We have two form captains in each     
 class for whom everyone in the class  
 votes. They have to do various jobs   
 for the teachers and are worked very  
 hard!                                 
 We have three Houses, Kings, Queens   
 and Trinity, and we have housepoints  
 for good work and behaviour.
