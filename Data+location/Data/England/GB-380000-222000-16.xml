		<title>16MAISEMORE HONEY FARM</title>
		<content>BEE KEEPING FOR EXPORT                 
 Just north of the village is Maisemore
Apiaries, a farm with over 800 hives on
surrounding land. It was started about 
50 years ago by the present owner's    
father with only one hive.             
 There is a large workshop where hives 
and other bee-keeping equipment are    
made. Honey and beeswax are processed  
for sale, in fact several types of     
honey are obtained such as clover and  
oil seed rape varieties. The main      
Â£harvest' season is July and August.   
 The company operates a thriving mail  
order business, with customers as far  
away as Ireland and Spain. Local people
call to buy honey and they enjoy having
the bees in the area as they pollinate 
their plants and fruit trees. Maisemore
honey costs 120p/lb and beeswax about  
300p/lb. It could cost 100 pounds to   
set up your own new hive.              </content>
