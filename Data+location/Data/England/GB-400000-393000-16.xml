		<content>{Mrs. Dawson}has lived in{Gamesley}for 
 fortyone years. She left school at 14 
 and got a job as a shoemaker making   
 sandals. She was paid{eight shillings 
 a week. When Mrs. Dawson was a girl   
 her house looked out over open fields.
 There was a{Co-op grocer's shop and   
{butcher's shop}nearby. The shops are  
 still there but now sell goods for    
 'do-it-yourself' work and are called{ 
{'The bent nail'!}The road was much    
 quieter as there were few cars. The   
 children went to{school}either at     
 Charlesworth or at Dinting, or if they
 were Roman Catholics to St.Mary's in  
 Glossop. For{entertainment}people went
 to the cinema either in Glossop or at 
 Woolley Bridge. The former is now a   
 supermarket and the latter has been   
 demolished. To shop Mrs. Dawson went  
 to Glossop, especially to the indoor  
 and outdoor market.                   </content>
