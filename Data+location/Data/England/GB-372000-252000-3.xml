		<title>03ALFRICK SCHOOL.</title>
		<content>  Alfrick Primary School was opened,as 
 a Board School,on the 18th.Sept.1876. 
 It is a typical Victorian school      
 building. Built of red brick with     
 stone window frames and a steeply     
 pitched slate roof.The classrooms were
 large with painted brick walls, wooden
 floors and very high ceilings.        
  Over the years the numbers changed.  
 When it first opened there were 26    
 children on roll,three weeks later    
 there were 91. In the early 20's there
 were 80 children with 3 teachers.In   
 the early 50's there were 50 children 
 still with 3 teachers.By 1983 the     
 number had dropped to 18 children with
 one teacher and it was decided to     
 close the school.The children were    
 transferred to Suckley School at the  
 beginning of Sept.1983. The closure   
 was an unpopular move as the school   
 had been held in high regard.         </content>
