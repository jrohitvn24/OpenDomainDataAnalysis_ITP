Freisians are normally used for dairy  
cattle because they give more milk than
Hereford cows. Herefords are mostly    
crossed with Freisians for beef. Cows  
which give most milk get more food than
cows which do not give much milk. The  
difference between Freisians and       
Hereford cross cows is that the        
Herefords have completely white faces  
and the Freisians have not. Cows have  
to be milked very regularly or the milk
will start to leak and the yields will 
begin to drop. The farmers milk their  
cows twice a  day, normally in the     
morning and in the evening. Farmers    
rise early each day.
