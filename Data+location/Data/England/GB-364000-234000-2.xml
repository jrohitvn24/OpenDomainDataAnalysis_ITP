		<title>02LITTLE MARCLE EMPLOYMENT</title>
		<content> Apart from a few jobs locally for     
 stockmen &amp; other farm workers, the    
 main source of permanent employment is
 Weston's cider plant at Much Marcle   
 which also has some agricultural jobs.
 Within fairly easy reach there is a   
 seasonal succession of casual landwork
 mainly for women.  It starts in the   
 winter with raspberry planting        
 continuing with hop tying, strawberry,
 raspberry &amp; blackcurrant picking, hop 
 processing &amp; apple harvesting         
 (including windfalls) into late       
 autumn.                               
 Two small concerns servicing          
 agricultural machinery &amp; vehicles     
 employ a few engineers &amp; mechanics.   
 There are some office jobs at the     
 headquarters of a farming combine, &amp;  
 at a group of small firms in Little   
 Marcle providing agricultural         
 services.                             </content>
