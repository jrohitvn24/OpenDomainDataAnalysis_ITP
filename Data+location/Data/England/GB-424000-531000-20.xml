		<content> We would have liked to have shown all 
 our names on this page but there      
 simply isn't room. We will therefore  
 put our year groups and our school.   
                                       
 The children, parents and teachers of:
{ ROSA STREET JMI SCHOOL (4th Year)    
         Spennymoor                    
{ KING STREET JM SCHOOL (4th Year)     
         Spennymoor                    
{ MIDDLESTONE MOOR JM SCHOOL (2nd, 3rd 
      Middlestone Moor   { &amp; 4th Years)
                                       
 We would like to thank all the people 
 who were interviewed and those who    
 invited us into their homes. We have  
 enjoyed the work and learned a great  
 deal more than can ever be represented
 in 20 pages of text. Thank you for    
 presenting us with this opportunity.
