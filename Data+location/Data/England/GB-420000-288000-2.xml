		<title>02Maxstoke,near Coleshill.</title>
		<content> Maxstoke is due east of Coleshill in  
 the river Blythe valley.Much of the   
 land is still owned by the Fetherstone
 -Dilke family who live in the very    
 fine Maxstoke castle.This is undamaged
 beautifully maitained,and quite often 
 open to the public.The parkland of the
 castle is a golf course and has a new 
 club house.Maxstoke is a scattered    
 village with no real centre.Church End
 has a few houses,a lovely church and  
 partly ruined Maxstoke Priory.There is
 no shop or public house and as the    
 school was closed the children go to  
 school in Coleshill.The houses are    
 mixed and include a "cruck"house,some 
 large and new houses,a few council    
 houses and several very fine half     
 timbered houses and farm houses.This  
 is a very beautiful area situated in  
 the ancient Forest of Arden.
