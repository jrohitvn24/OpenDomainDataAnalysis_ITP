		<content> shoulder identification to distinguish
 them from those of neighbouring farms.
      The farm has 2 breeding bulls, a 
 Hereford and a Charolais.  The cows   
 used to breed from were crossbred     
 Friesan, Limousin and Aberdeen Angus. 
 There were 35 suckler cows, 20        
 2-year-old cows, 44 1-year-old cows   
 and 38 calves.  It is the policy of   
 the farm to sell the cattle when they 
 are 2.5 years old.  The cattle are    
 grazed in the fields as long as the   
 weather and grass growth permit.  In  
 the cold winter months the cattle are 
 brought into shed accommodation where 
 they are fed silage and hay and other 
 commmercial feeds.                    
      The main machinery on the farm is
 of course associated with the         
 production of the grass feed and      
 consists of 4 tractors, a muck        
 spreader, forage harvester, elevator, </content>
