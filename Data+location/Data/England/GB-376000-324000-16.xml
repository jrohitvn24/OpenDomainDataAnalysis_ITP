		<content> The area has a twelth Century Anglican
 Church in High Offley, and a Methodist
 Chapel built in the last quarter of   
 the nineteenth Century in Woodseaves. 
 The Anglican Parish of High Offley    
 has recently been joined with the     
 Parish of Norbury, and now has three  
 churches, two of which are out of the 
 area covered by this survey.          
 The Rector of the joint Parishes lives
 in Woodseaves.                        
 Services at the three churches are    
 conducted on a rota basis, for example
 at Saint Mary's High Offley on the    
 first, &amp; third  Sundays each month    
 there is a Communion Service at 9.00  
 a.m., and Evensong at 18.30 p.m. On   
 the second and fourth Sundays         
 Communion is held at 10.00 a.m and    
 there is no Evensong at High Offley.
