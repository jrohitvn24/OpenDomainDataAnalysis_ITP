		<title>18Caravan Site : Clifton</title>
		<content>  The Caravan Site has tents as well as
 caravans and people come from all over
 the world to stay. In 1984 there were 
 visitors from 36 different countries  
 staying on the site, including eastern
 block countries. At the moment this is
 a rural site within easy reach of     
 York but building is scheduled to     
 completely surround it.On vandalism Mr
 Herbert the owner told us that damage 
 is caused by cigarette burns and      
 people deliberately defacing property.
 He welcomes the new ring road. At one 
 time it was scheduled to pass through 
 the site but now it will be very      
 convenient for visitors to reach the  
 site. The site has facilities such as 
 2 toilet blocks,club rooms,games rooms
 and children's play areas.The site    
 holds 155 caravans and tents and is a 
 popular place for the local population
 as well as visitors.                  </content>
