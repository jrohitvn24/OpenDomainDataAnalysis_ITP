		<content>  SOMERSHAM'S CLIMATE IS FAIRLY DRY AS 
 IT HAS ONE OF THE LOWEST AVERAGE      
 RAINFALLS IN THE COUNTRY.  THE FLAT   
 OPEN EXPANSE OF LAND TO THE EAST LAYS 
 SOMERSHAM OPEN TO THE SWEEPING EFFECTS
 OF THE WINDS WHICH BLOW OFF THE FENS. 
 THE LAND, HOWEVER, IS VERY WET AS IT  
 CONSISTS OF RECLAIMED LAND DRAINED BY 
 MANY DYKES.  THE DAMP AREAS ATTRACT   
 BIRDS INCLUDING KINGFISHERS AND FLOCKS
 OF BEWICK SWANS.  AS WELL AS MANY     
 COMMON BIRDS, PHEASANTS, LAPWING AND  
 KESTRELS ARE OFTEN SEEN.  IN SOMERSHAM
 THERE IS A LAKE WITH BREEDING SWANS,  
 MORHEN, GREAT CRESTED GREBE AND       
 MALLARD DUCKS. IT IS USED FOR FISHING 
 AND HAS CARP, ROACH, BREAM AND PIKE. A
 LARGE PIKE (27 LBS) HAS TAKEN SOME    
 DUCKLINGS. TREES ROUND THE LAKE       
 INCLUDE WILLOW, HAWTHORN AND MAPLE.   
  AN OLD RAILWAY TRACK ATTRACTS        
 WILD LIFE AND IS AN INTERESTING WALK. </content>
