		<content>Myself, my dad, my sister and my cousin
all went to a small island in the      
Mediterranean called Minorca.   We     
stopped in a villa for two weeks .   I 
enjoyed it very much and I hope I can  
go there again.(Annette)   We are going
to Barmouth this year, our caravan site
is owned by D.J.Williams and it has a  
part for people with tents to camp on. 
It has showers to put tokens in, you   
get the tokens from the shop as you    
drive in.   They have toilets as       
well.   Our Dad lives in  Cornwall so  
we will visit him later on.(Louise)   I
have been to a few countries Spain,    
Majorca and Austria.   I liked Spain   
best because I went with my cousins.   
When I go on holiday I like to spend   
most of my time in the pool but my     
parents like to get out and visit      
places.(Andrew)
