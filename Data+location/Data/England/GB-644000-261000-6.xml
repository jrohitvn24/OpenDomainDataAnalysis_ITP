		<title>06Leiston Fire Station.</title>
		<content> Leiston has a fire station with one   
fire engine. If you need it you dial   
999 and it doesn,t cost you any money. 
There are 10 firemen who train on every
Monday evening and they have to carry a
bleeper everywhere they go even while  
they are in bed.If it bleeps they rush 
to the fire station and the first 6 to 
get there go on the fire engine.Every  
man has to wear a helmet,thigh-boots,  
waterproof leggings, fire proof jacket 
and trousers.                          
 Including equipement the fire engine  
cost about 50,000 pounds.It goes up to 
70mph and blows a loud siren.On it are 
hoses, long ladders,lots of water,foam 
and tools.                             
  Leiston fire engine is very important
because if there was an emergency at   
Sizewell Power Station, it would be    
needed very quickly.
