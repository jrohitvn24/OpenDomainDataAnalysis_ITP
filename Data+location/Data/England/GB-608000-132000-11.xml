		<title>11Lympne Primary School</title>
		<content>    Lympne Church of England Primary   
 School was opened in 1872 with        
 approximately 15 children as a result 
 of the 1870 Education Act which said  
 that all children should receive a    
 state education. It was built with    
 funds supplied by the Church and was a
 one class school for children ranging 
 in age from 5 to 14, the little ones  
 sitting in the front and the older    
 ones at the back.                     
    During the early days the children 
 were mainly from homes of the farming 
 community, and up until about 1920    
 they actually had a two week break to 
 help with the harvest.                
    The school presently has 91        
 children on the role, rising to       
 approximately 110 at the end of the   
 school year. Of these 91 children not 
 one comes from a home which has any   
 connection with farming.              </content>
