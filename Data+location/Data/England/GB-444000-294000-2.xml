		<content>   The land slopes gently from west to 
 east from 130 metres in the north west
 to 76 metres in the east.             
 The annual mean temperature is 12.6   
 degrees centigrade with January the   
 coldest month and July the warmest.   
 The growing season lasts about 230    
 days from March to November.  The     
 average rainfall is relatively modest 
 (approximately 700 mm per annum) with 
 no clear cut seasonal variation.      
 The soil formation for the whole area 
 is Tinius Keuper Marl, a red, silty   
 clay, apart from a small area of      
 overlain glacial boulder clay or till;
 a complex mosaic of clay, silt and    
 sand.                                 
 The vegetation is mainly agricultural,
 in particular barley and improved     
 grazing, and extensive woodland known 
 as the Burbage Common and Woods.
