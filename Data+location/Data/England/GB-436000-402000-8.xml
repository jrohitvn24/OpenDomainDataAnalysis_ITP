		<title>08A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> AGED 1O+, MOST OF MY DAYS ARE SPENT AT
 SCHOOL. I GET UP AY 8.OO A.M. AND HAVE
 A BREAKFAST OF  CEREALS. THEN I WASH  
 AND SET OFF FOR SCHOOL AT 8.4O A.M. MY
 SCHOOL IS WORSBROUGH BANK END PRIMARY 
 AND I AM IN THE OLDEST JUNIOR CLASS.  
 IT   WAS OPENED ABOUT 2O YEARS AGO BUT
 I HAVE ONLY BEEN ATTENDING FOR ABOUT  
 15 MONTHS , OUR FAMILY MOVING INTO THE
 AREA FROM CUNDY CROSS. AFTER THE      
 REGISTER WE BEGIN LESSONS WHICH       
 INCLUDE TOPICS, SINGING, PHYSICAL ED.,
 READING, MATHS, ENGLISH, GAMES,       
 SWIMMING AND R.E. I LIKE SWIMMING BUT 
 I DON'T LIKE MATHS BECAUSE I ALWAYS   
 GET "SEE ME" ON MY WORK. AT PLAYTIME I
 JOIN IN THE FOOTBALL ON THE YARD. ITS 
 A ROUGH GAME BUT WE ENJOY IT. SCHOOL  
 DINNERS ARE 5OP. AND SCHOOL CLOSES AT 
 3.45 P.M. WHEN HOME I GET MY BIKE OUT,
 PLAY WITH FRIENDS OR WATCH TELEVISION 
 AND BEDTIME IS AT ABOUT 1O P.M.       </content>
