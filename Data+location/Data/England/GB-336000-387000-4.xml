		<title>04Mammals in Sefton Park</title>
		<content> Eleven  species  of  mammal  have been
 recorded in  Sefton Park  and  nine of
 these are fairly common. However, most
 are nocturnal.                        
 In daylight the most  easily  observed
 mammal in the  park is the {brown rat.
 The larger{water vole}is  found around
 the lakes and streams. The only  other
 mammals  likely  to be seen by day are
 the{rabbits}near the palm house.      
 At  night {hedgehogs, field  mice }and
{field voles}come  out of their  hiding
 places to  feed on fallen  nuts, seeds
 and insects.                          
 The use of ultra-sound  equipment  has
 resulted  in  the  detection  of three
 species of{bat}in the park.  These are
 the {noctule,}the {common  pipistrelle
 and{Daubenton's bat.                  
 In the next  decade it is thought that
{grey squirrels}will become established
 in the park.                          </content>
