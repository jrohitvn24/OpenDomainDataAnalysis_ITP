		<content>      Much of the southern section of  
 our survey area is taken up by the    
 English Channel. Views over this area 
 will always include vessels of various
 types. An abundance of yachts and     
 other recreational craft, such as     
 rowing boats and motor launches abound
 in the warmer months. Fishing vessels 
 will be seen close to the shore       
 lifting their lobster pots or setting 
 their nets.                           
      Commercial shipping can be seen, 
 including the Truckline Ferry Service 
 between Poole and Cherbourg. Also the 
 passenger ferry from Weymouth to      
 Cherbourg or the Channel Islands may  
 be sighted.                           
      Occasionally naval vessels will  
 be seen using the nautical mile posts 
 near Anvil Point to test their        
 navigatioal instruments and their     
 engines.                              </content>
