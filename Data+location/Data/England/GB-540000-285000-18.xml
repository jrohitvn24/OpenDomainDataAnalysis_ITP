		<title>18Chatteris - Spinning a Yarn</title>
		<content> Members of Chatteris' Business and    
 Professional Women's Association, spun
 a yarn at their summer evening on     
 Monday 24th of June.  The meeting was 
 held in Cromwell Community College and
 the guest speaker was Mrs Ryder who   
 showed members how to spin.           
                                       
 She produced two sweaters made from   
 one sheep's fleece.  She said the wool
 had to be washed, carded, teased and  
 stretched before being wound into     
 skeins.  It was then dyed and washed  
 again.                                
                                       
 The Club produced a concert on Friday 
 28th June.  Entertainment was provided
 by the Georgillian Singers.  All the  
 proceeds from the event were given to 
 the local CAMTAD group (Campaign for  
 Tackling Acquired Deafness). The      
 meeting was well attended.            </content>
