		<title>04A DAY IN MY LIFE-L.HARROCKS</title>
		<content> When I get up in  morning I go down to
 have my breakfast. I usually have corn
 flakes. After that I get washed and   
 clean my teeth and get dressed. Then I
 go to school. When I get to school I  
 line up. Mrs Smith meets us and we go 
 in and read for ten minutes. Then we  
 go to assembly and sing some hymns. We
 go back to the classroom and do       
 English, usually spelling. What we do 
 is write down words into our spelling 
 books and then put them into          
 sentences. Then it's first play. After
 that we have maths. It's usually sums.
 Next we go to the hall for lunch, then
 I play football. We then go in and do 
 our project, which is called the      
 Domesday Project. I like it because we
 go on outings. Then it's games, my    
 favourite part of the day. We often   
 play Pip, Squeak and Wilfred.I go home
 with my Mum, have tea and go to bed.  </content>
