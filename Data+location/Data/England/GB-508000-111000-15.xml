		<title>15SUPERNATURAL - SULLINGTON</title>
		<content> There are several instances of the    
 supernatural in Sullington Parish and 
 even today unexplainable pulsating    
 lights have been seen by scores of    
 people on different parts of the      
 Downs. A ghostly, headless man roams  
 the area and different ghostly animals
 are seen, the most popular being a    
 galloping horse.  It was well known   
 years ago that horses would not pass a
 certain point on the road between     
 Washington and Storrington. Carters of
 that time all carried knives to cut   
 the invisible spirits from around the 
 wheels of the cart and around the     
 horses hooves.  Even today people     
 still get an eerie feeling near the   
 place.
