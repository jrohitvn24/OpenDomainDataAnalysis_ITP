		<title>17Brackley birds and insects</title>
		<content>   Outside our mobile classroom we     
looked for birds and insects. It is on 
the edge of the school field next to   
a bank which has trees down it. In the 
morning it is very rich with bird life 
and we saw the following birds. The    
woodpigeon and starling were hunting   
for worms. We saw greenfinches, wrens, 
goldfinches, starlings, chaffinches,   
blackbirds, blue tits and bullfinches  
in trees. The jackdaws, swallows and   
house martins were on the wing and the 
coots were on the lake.                
   Behind the mobile we also found a   
lot of insects. Flea beetles were very 
common (we saw the green and brown     
varieties). They can jump about 15-20cm
high which is surprising as they are   
only 7mm long. We also saw ants, blue  
damselflies, sailor beetles, greenfly, 
ladybirds, daddy-long-legs and snails.
