		<content>The land chosen for development was the
original site of the National School,  
the Town yard,housing the Fire Station,
the Abattoir and terraced houses for   
local mill-workers. Due to the increase
in population the following amenities  
are needed;A Sports and Leisure Centre,
Community/Social facilities,eg.A Hall; 
Offices,Residential Hotel,Car Parks,   
Department Stores,Restaurants,Car Show-
Rooms,Single Unit Shops and some Houses
This is the most important development 
on a large scale, to take place in the 
Town for many years,great care is being
taken on the design of the buildings,  
and the surrounding landscaping of the 
Area. It is hoped to complement the    
existing Main Shopping Street of the   
Chorley, which is dominated at the     
North end by St. Mary's R.C. Church,   
and the Town Hall opposite the new     
Royal Oak Shopping Development.        </content>
