		<content>  HELLO! MY NAME IS PAMELA TURNER.I AM 
 11 YEARS OLD AND LIVE IN              
 WALTON-LE-DALE, NEAR PRESTON, LANCS.MY
 HOBBIES ARE HORSE-RIDING,             
 SWIMMING,READING AND PLAYING VARIOUS  
 SPORTS/ I LIKE HORSE-RIDING BEST  AND 
 MY AMBITION IS TO OWN MY OWN HORSE    
 WHEN I AM OLDER. IT IS VERY GOOD FUN  
 BUT  YOU HAVE TO WORK VERY HARD       
 -DESPITE THAT, I STILL ENJOY IT. ON   
 SATURDAYS I GO TO SOME STABLES CALLED 
 'OAKFIELD' IN LEYLAND AND HAVE AN     
 HOUR'S  LESSON (WHICH COSTS ABOUT     
 THREE POUNDS). I REALLY ENJOY THE     
 LESSONS AND ON SUNDAYS, I GO TO MY    
 GRANDMA'S AND GO HORSE-RIDING AGAIN   
 AND  HELP OUT AT SOME LOCAL STABLES.  
 IT IS A SMASHING HOBBY, BECAUSE IT    
 GETS YOU OUT INTO THE FRESH AIR AND IS
 A VERY HEALTHY EXERCISE. I ALSO LOVE  
 HORSES VERY MUCH AND LIKE CARING FOR  
 THEM.                                 </content>
