		<title>16THE LIFE OF CHILDREN.</title>
		<content>   The children lead busy lives and are
{expected to help around the farm.}Some
 of them have to bring cows in for     
 milking before going to school.Other  
 jobs expected of them are seasonal    
 like feeding orphaned lambs, helping  
 with sheep shearing and dipping, and  
 silaging and haymaking.               
    Their school day is long as most of
 them{live many miles from the school }
 and therefore have to be transported  
 by a taxi service of minibuses. This  
 trip around narrow roads is made even 
 worse during the{bad winters }that are
 experienced here.Each year the school 
 is closed for a few days due to the   
 heavy snow falls.                     
     Most children live on isolated    
 farms and their{friends can live up } 
{to 4 miles away.}This means a friend  
 will often stay a whole day rather    
 than play for an hour or so.          </content>
