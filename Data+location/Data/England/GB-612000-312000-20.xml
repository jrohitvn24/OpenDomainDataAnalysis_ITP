		<content>     'I live in Taverham but usually we
 play in Ringland.In summer we{fish}and
 swim &amp; in winter we{sledge}on Ringland
 Hills but its very dangerous. It joins
 a rd. and sometimes we can't stop and 
 go into the rd.                       
     The{fishing rights}from the bridge
 at Attlebridge to Taverham bridge are 
 shared by 3 landowners. The river has 
 mostly{chubb &amp; minnows.The}bait we use
 is{bread &amp; maggots.}There are a few   
{eels}under Taverham bridge and lots of
 eels in Ringland so we're not allowed 
 to swim there but there are{common    
{rights}at Ringland Bridge so we can   
 swim ans fish there.'{(David Bye)
