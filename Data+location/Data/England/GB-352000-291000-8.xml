		<title>08A MIXED FARM IN APE_DALE</title>
		<content> This is a fairly typical mixed{family}
{farm,}the 260 acres are divided       
 between corn,grazing and silage for   
 the dairy herd.This consists of 100   
 Fresian cows and 2 bulls(1Hereford,&amp;  
 1Charolais).The calves are sold at one
 week old and replacements are bought  
 and reared on the farm.There is also a
 flock of 50 breeding ewes.In addition 
 to the owner,his 2 sons and 1 cowman  
 staff the farm,which lies at the foot 
 of{Wenlock Edge}in a limestone valley.
 This tends to mean a heavy type soil  
 and much capital has been spent on    
 draining the land.Powerful equipment  
 is needed and 4-wheeltractors are     
 essential.To ensure a good yield the  
 sowing has to be done in the Autumn.  
 Very often it is impossible to {work  
{the land}in Spring.Thus as soon as the
 corn is harvested,ploughing cmmences.
