		<title>01WILLOUGHBY-ON THE WOLDS</title>
		<content> Our block is a farming area situated  
 on the Nottinghamshire/Leicestershire 
 border.The land is fairly flat and the
 pasture is good although it is a clay 
 soil,which makes gardening hard work! 
 A lot of people round here own and    
 ride horses.The only village within   
 the block is                          
{Willoughby-on-the-Wolds,}with a       
 population of around 500.There is     
 little employment in the area except  
 on farms,so most people commute to    
 Loughborough,Leicester or Nottingham  
 to work.However Willoughby does have  
 its own school,church,chapel,pub,Post 
 Office cum village store,and a pie    
 shop.Unfortunately,the village bakery 
 recently closed down.There is a strong
 community spirit within the area with 
 keen support for any activities which 
 are organized.
