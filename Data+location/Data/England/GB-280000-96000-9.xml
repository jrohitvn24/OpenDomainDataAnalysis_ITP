		<content> to make silage.To keep the grass dry  
 and in the same condition as it was   
 cut the farmers put a large plastic   
 sheet over it all, with lots of old   
 car tyres on top to keep the sheet in 
 place. This also keeps out moisture   
 and air. It is left then till the     
 winter when it is fed to the cattle   
 and sheep.Then we saw the pen the     
 farmer puts the bullocks in before    
 they mate.There is an escape route    
 both sides so that a man can get out  
 and the bull stays in.It is illegal   
 not to have one.Once again we saw some
 more cows,one was called Charlie and  
 he was really tame.                   
   When we got back to the Pope's      
 farmhouse we got changed for swimming 
 and went in the outdoor pool in the   
 garden.It was lovely and warm although
 it was cloudy and then it began to    
 spit with rain!                       </content>
