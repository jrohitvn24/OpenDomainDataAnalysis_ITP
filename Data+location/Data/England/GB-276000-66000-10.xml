		<title>10The Old Quarry Landscove</title>
		<content> This is at OS 763673 in our block .It 
 was begun in 1834 by Benjamin Recca to
 produce{slate}for the building trade. 
 The slate was of particularly fine    
 quality and over 100 men were working 
 there in 1854 when Landscove School   
 and St.Matthews Church were           
 built,largely to serve the families of
 the quarrymen.The owner toured the    
 countryside in search of orders and   
 his most famous order was for roofs of
 both Houses of Parliament in          
 London.                               
      The quarrying ceased in 1897 when
 the great slate{quarries}of North     
 Wales were able to produce thinner    
 more uniform slate at a cheaper price.
     The{explosive}used here came from 
 Powder Mills Princetown as the bill   
 from Mr.Frean for 'rock powder'tells  
 us.Quarrying must have been hard and  
 dangerous work in the 19th Century.   </content>
