		<title>11FARMING (ii)</title>
		<content> Sheep farming is usually combined with
 beef but Lincombe farms sheep alone.  
 There are 150 Scotch Blackface at     
 Shapley, 40 Dartmoors at Batworthy; at
 other farms e.g. Langaford, where     
 there are 250 sheep, there are mixed  
 breeds. Suffolk Cross are bred for    
 meat, Close Wools are for pure        
 breeding. Annual grass sales are a    
 feature of agricultural life. Pasture 
 is sold April _ October. Some winter  
 grazing in the kinder climate of      
 S.Devon is rented. Hay baling, silage 
 making and hedge cutting are now      
 contracted out to cut capital cost, as
 is sheep dipping (one tractor costs   
 #13,000). Hedge cutting by flail now  
 replaces traditional methods such as  
 "cut and lay". Bee keepers, as at     
 Brock Park suffer because of damage to
 flowering shoots. Silage is now used  
 more than hay for winter feed.        </content>
