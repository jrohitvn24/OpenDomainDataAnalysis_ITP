		<content>    In a survey of Raby Street school  
 we found that parents are mostly      
}unemployed.  Most employed people     
 are cleaners.                         
    The manpower intelligence unit told
 us that Newcastle 60,000 people are   
 shopworkers, 45,000 are fitters.  The 
 other most popular jobs were nurses,  
 shorthand typists, teachers and lorry 
 and van drivers.  The geatest         
 employment was people who work in     
 shops.                                
    Employment has changed because     
 there used to be shipyards and rail   
 tracks by the Tyne but now there are  
 fewer jobs there.  The big factories  
 for flour making and other things are 
 closing down.                         
    New machinery has caused redundancy
 because fewer people are needed to run
 it.                                   
                                       </content>
