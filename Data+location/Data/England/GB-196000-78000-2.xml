		<title>02A Day In The Life Of ......</title>
		<content>   On Wednesday my dad would wake me up
 at 7.30a.m. I would get dressed       
 quickly and go down stairs for        
 breakfast and I would say "Hello Jess"
 I have a bowl full of Shredded Wheat  
 which is made from Bran,then I have 2 
 slices of toast. Then I go up stairs  
 to go and clean my teeth in the       
 bathroom.Teeth are white things in    
 your mouth and you use them to chew   
 with.Then I go down stairs to do my   
 piano practice. Then I would put on my
 coat and set out for school.A school  
 is a box with rooms in for each       
 class.In the afternoon Tina and I     
 go to Bodmin, which is   the town we  
 have our Guitar lessons.At 3.50p.m. we
 come home I watch the telly which is a
 box which you turn on and off,and a   
 picture comes on .I have my tea at    
 5.30a.m.  tea is like breakfast and   
 at 10.30a.m. I go to bed.             </content>
