		<title>15DOLLIS BROOK</title>
		<content>   Dollis Brook is approximately 8     
 miles in length. It rises in Moat     
 Mount Open Space and flows into the   
 River Brent.                          
   It is a meandering brook and it is  
 possible to walk along it through     
 attractive park and play areas.       
   There is a good example of an oxbow 
 lake at Dollis Road.                  
   Dollis Brook has to pass under      
 several large roads including the     
 A1/A41 at Hendon Lane.  A large 13    
 arch railway viaduct crosses over it  
 between Finchley and Mill Hill.       
   The brook meanders its way down from
 Barnet on the West side of the A1000, 
 through Whetstone, North Finchley, and
 Finchley Central. It then veers West  
 under the viaduct towards the A1 to   
 join the River Brent which flows into 
 the Brent Reservoir.
