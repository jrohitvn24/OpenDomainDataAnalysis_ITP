		<content>  Well Vale Farms are owned by an      
 American and are run on a day to day  
 basis by a manager with 7 other people
 employed on the farms.                
  The farms consist of 1252 acres of   
 farming land and 400 acres of         
 woodland. Although there are 160      
 breeding sheep, on permanent pasture  
 land, the farm is mainly arable with  
 wheat, barley, oilseed rape and peas  
 grown. The land is reasonably fertile 
 and relies on a very mechanised       
 farming practice, including the use of
 5 tractors and a combine harvester.   
  The use of more technology in farming
 has meant that many of the farm       
 labourers' cottages now stand idle or 
 are used as holiday accommodation.
