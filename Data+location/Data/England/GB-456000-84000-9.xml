		<content> Sandown{AIRPORT}is just off the       
 Newport Road on the outskirts of Lake.
  It is 50 years old this year which   
 means it was built in 1935.  It is    
 owned by Evergreen Holdings and part  
 of it is owned by a private company.  
 The airport has one runway which is   
 1000m. long.  Aircraft use the runway 
 in both directions but not at the same
 time! The airport's area covers 80    
 acres. The campsite near the airport  
 helps business a lot, because the     
{TOURISTS} take advantage of the       
 pleasure flights.  Sandown airport    
 gets a lot of competition from        
 Bembridge, but Sandown has the edge on
 Bembridge because of its facilities   
 including a cafe, toilets and hangers.
  Between 2 and 53 planes land there   
 each day, and 7000-8000 land there    
 each year.                            
                                       </content>
