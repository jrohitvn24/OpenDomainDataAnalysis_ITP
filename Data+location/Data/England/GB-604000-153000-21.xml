<title>21Old Wives Lees 2011</title>
<content>Old Wives Lees only has one operating retail premises in the form of the Star Inn.  Both shops have gone and the  telephone box (still an original red telephone box) has been moved to outside the Mission Hall.  Although now larger than a small hamlet and forming part of the Chilham Parish, it should be thought of as a village in its own right.  It is still abundant in orchards, however its crop is now apples only and the cherries are a distant memory.&lt;br />&lt;br />New housing has been built at the top of the village (Shrimpton Close), and what was once wasteland in the centre of the village has been turned into a pleasant and large village green, complete with play area.  The original play area remains at the top of Green Lane but now has the function of a sports field, with basketball court, football pitch and shelter on the site.&lt;br />
