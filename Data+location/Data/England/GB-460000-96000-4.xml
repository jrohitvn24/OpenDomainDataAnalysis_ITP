		<content>      The buses in our area are single 
 deckers painted green and run by      
 Provincial.  There are two major bus  
 routes through our area. Their route  
 is Fareham to Gosport. The buses run  
 from Alverstoke to Gosport Town, so   
 that people can get on ferries and    
 buses to other destinations.  The     
 buses are used mainly by old peple and
 schoolchildren.                       
      There are quite a lot of ferries 
 that travel through our area.  The    
 Townsend Thoreson and Brittany ferries
 to France and Sealink goes to the Isle
 of Wight and to the Channel Islands.  
      From near Clarence Pier at       
 Southsea the Hovercraft makes regular 
 crossings throughout the year to Ryde 
 on the Isle of Wight.
