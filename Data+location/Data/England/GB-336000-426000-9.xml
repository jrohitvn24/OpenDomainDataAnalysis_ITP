		<title>09LYTHAM SEAFRONT CONTINUED</title>
		<content>{Charlie's Mast}a prominent landmark   
 was once used for signalling to       
 sailing vessels using Lytham Dock.    
{Lytham Pier}was also a seafront       
 feature,however,it was destroyed by   
 fire in 1960.                         
   {Lytham Windmill}the most famous    
 landmark was built in 1805.It was used
 for grinding corn and making flour.In 
 1919 the 4 sails were blown in the    
 wrong direction-so ruining the        
 machinery and causing a fire in the   
 mill.                                 
   There are now plans to convert the  
 windmill into a working museum        
 grinding flour for sale to tourists.  
 However,insufficient funds are        
 available from the Council.Such plans 
 are likely to be further delayed as   
 serious rising damp has just been     
 dicovered.
