    WHAT WAS THE OLD TOWN LIKE?(contd.)
 Skelmersdale used to be centred around
 Sandy Lane.That was a very busy place 
 with more than 40 shops.You could buy 
 anything from a pin to a piano.       
    WHAT MAJOR CHANGES HAVE YOU SEEN?  
 With the New Town came lots of        
 outsiders,mainly from Liverpool,so the
 town lost its family atmosphere.There 
 used to be a railway,that's gone      
 now.All the work was in the collieries
 so nobody travelled out of the town.  
   ARE THE CHANGES FOR THE BETTER?     
 I have mixed feelings.We must progress
 but I don't think the New Town has    
 lived up to expectations.There should 
 be more amenities like a theatre,a    
 cinema for this district,a good dance 
 hall and better recreational          
 facilities for the very young and for 
 the aged.                             </content>
