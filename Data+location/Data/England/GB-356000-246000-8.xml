		<title>08Cereals &amp; Potatoes in Felton</title>
		<content> Potatoes are grown as the main crop on
 about thirty hectares in about four   
 different varieties and sold to the   
 fish and chip store outlets.  They are
 planted in April and sprayed for the  
 control of blight.  Approximately 17  
 hectares are irrigated in the dry     
 season.  They are harvested           
 mechanically during October.  There   
 are a wide range of cereals grown in  
 the area, particularly as the         
 Government Experimental Farm tests and
 experiments with many different       
 varieties and growing conditions.  The
 heavier yielding winter barley is     
 taking over from the spring barley.   
 Winter wheat is grown on about 200    
 hectares.  About 15 hectares of winter
 oats act as a break crop  before      
 wheat.  Oil seed rape is grown only at
 Rosemaund on an experimental basis.
