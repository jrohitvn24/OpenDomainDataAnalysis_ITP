		<title>10Questionnaire Survey</title>
		<content>    A house to house survey was        
 conducted of people living in 3       
 villages, collecting information      
 about 75 people. They were asked about
 place &amp; type of work, shopping habits,
 place of birth &amp; religion.            
    Nearly all 'everyday items' in each
 village were bought in Amersham &amp;     
 Chesham, as were most electronic      
 goods. London was the main centre for 
 clothes shopping (30% of people),     
 Watford (22%) and locally (26%) also  
 being important. Furniture followed   
 the same pattern, Wycombe also adding 
 10%, but some people said that        
 theirs was antique or inherited.      
    The Church of England was the      
 largest religious group represented   
 (62%) while 25% more belonged to other
 churches, only 4% stating that they   
 did not belong to any religion.
