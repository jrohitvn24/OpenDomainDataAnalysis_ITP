{Headlam Hall}was a manor house built  
 in the 18th century showing Jacobean  
 and 18th century work. It was         
 converted in 1981 to a hotel and      
 restaurant. It is the only amenity in 
 the village and is quite imposing.    
{Gainford Hall}is now a working farm.  
 It is a fine example of a Jacobean    
 mansion and reflects all the important
 points of its period. It was famous   
 for breeding pedigree bulls. In the   
 garden there is a 17th century        
 dovecote with a 'beehive' domed roof. 
{Barforth Hall}today is a working farm.
 It was a manor house built in the     
 Elizabethan period. Today it is used  
 as a house by the owners of the farm  
 Mr. and Mrs. Reeves. It has been      
 painted white with black window       
 frames.
