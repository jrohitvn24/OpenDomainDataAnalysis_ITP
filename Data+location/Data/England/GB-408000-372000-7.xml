		<content>                                       
 Conservation is very important in     
 quarrying.Normally promises have to be
 made to conserve the countryside.This 
{does not apply to Tunstead  Quarry}as 
 it was opened before this law was     
 made.Tunstead quarry is expanding     
 onto{Old Moor}and{ICI} have had to    
 agree with the Peak Park Planning     
 Board to conserve this area.Tunstead  
 Quarry is a well-designed and situated
 quarry as it is{unnoticed from the    
{road}until you are actually inside it.
 One reason for this is because of     
{trees planted around the quarry.      
     There have been suggestions about 
 the future of the quarry when ICI is  
 done with it.It may be used as a{     
{leisure centre}or a{football arena.   
{  } There are models showing how it   
 might be possible to landscape the the
 quarry.                               </content>
