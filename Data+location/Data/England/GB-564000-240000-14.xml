		<title>14Wiggen's Farm,House,Barn.</title>
		<content> The barn was built about 1470 so it is
 515 years old.A man named{Cecil Hewitt
 could tell how old the barn was by a  
{scarf joint}which is two pieces of    
 wood joined together with a peg in the
 middle of the two pieces of wood.The  
 lord of the land had in the barn two  
 wooden floors and one firm floor and  
 men used to thresh using a flail on   
 the two wooden floors.The lord made   
 them get to a rythm.When the lord was 
 a mile away he could still hear them  
 flailing on the wooden floors.Then in 
 Victorian times the{Emson}family took 
 over and they bred big heavy horses   
 called{Percherons.}The house has a    
 kitchen and breakfast room which are  
 as old as the barn.They are 515 years 
 old.They were a dairy. They used      
 to keep cows in with them.The floor   
 was built in Tudor times. For a time  
 the barn was a Health Food Store.     </content>
