		<content> A number of wildfowl, including mute  
 swans, mallard, coot and great crested
 grebe, breed on Sutton Bingham        
 reservoir, and cormorants are among   
 other species regularly seen. In      
 winter numbers and variety increase   
 greatly, &amp; the occasional rarity such 
 as an osprey may be spotted. Badgers, 
 foxes &amp; roe deer are plentiful through
 out the area, the last named commonest
 in the woodlands. Gardeners are not   
 too happy about the deer but are      
 pleased to have plenty of slow worms, 
 hedgehogs &amp; toads. The birds are      
 mainly the expected denizens of woods,
 open fields &amp; gardens. There are      
 buzzards in Pen Wood, jackdaws &amp; wood-
 peckers in the trees near Halstock    
 Church. Among summer migrants spotted 
 flycatchers, swifts, house martins &amp;  
 swallows are plentiful. Cuckoos often 
 heard, kestrals a familiar sight.     </content>
