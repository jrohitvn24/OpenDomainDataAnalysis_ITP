		<content> Until the second world war,Bredon was 
 confined between the church and the   
 railway line.There were many small    
 cottages such as{Magpie Row,Jackdaw   
{Terrace}and the cottages near the     
 railway line.The{Alms houses}were     
 founded by{Katherine Reed}in 1696     
 which were 8 small cottages but       
 gradually reduced to 6.There were     
 quite a few large houses including    
 Bredon House,The Old Mansion,The      
 Manor,The Rectory,The Cider House,    
 Wellington Lodge.In the 1950's 80     
 council houses were built and the     
 estate was called{Queensmead}.Later in
 the 1960's{St Giles Road,Brasenose Rd.
 and{College Rd.}were built,adding     
 70 houses.10 years later 16 houses    
 were constructed called{Waterloo Way. 
 These few houses grew and became      
{Wellington Gardens.}In the end there  
 were 260 houses on this estate.       </content>
