		<title>18GRYCE HALL</title>
		<content> Lord Savile lives in Gryce Hall which 
 is a very old house with gargoyles on 
 the walls. Some words are carved in   
 wood over the main door and an ancient
 statue of a king is set into the wall 
 outside the gate. Although Gryce Hall 
 is large it does not attract attention
 because it is hidden away in the      
 countryside, surrounded by trees. In  
 response to two letters written to the
 Lord Savile, he rang us and gave us   
 more information.He said that Gryce   
 Hall was a combination of two         
 cottages, with a barn in the middle   
 converted to a drawing room. He bought
 it in 1946 and moved there in 1947.   
 Altogether there are about twenty     
 rooms and his favourite is his study. 
 There are no ghosts. Gryce Hall stands
 in fifty-two acres. Two acres are     
 gardened and fifty acres are used for 
 farming.                              </content>
