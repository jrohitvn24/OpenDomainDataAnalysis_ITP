		<title>12LIFE IN AN OLD HOUSE</title>
		<content>   THE FARMHOUSE IS OVER 400 YEARS     
 OLD.ELELCTRICITY WAS INSTALLED IN THE 
 1920'S FOR THE COST OF Â£15.00. AT THAT
 TIME NOT MANY HOUSES HAD ELECTRICITY  
 NOT LONG AFTERWARDS THEY HAD WATER    
 PIPED ACROSS THE FIELDS FROM ANOTHER  
 FARM NEVERTHELESS THEY STILL HAD TO   
 HEAT THE WATER TO WASH. BEFORE        
 THE ELECTRICITY WAS INSTALLED THE     
 FAMILY USED OIL LAMPS. NOW THE HOUSE  
 HAS CENTRAL HEATING,PIPED HOT WATER   
 AND AN INSIDE LAVATORY,AS WELL AS     
 MODERN AMENITIES SUCH AS A TELEPHONE  
 AND TELEVISION.THE FARMER'S WIFE HAS  
 AN AGA- A COAL BURNING COOKER. THE    
 FAMILY IN WINTER HAVE AN OPEN FIRE IN 
 SOME ROOMS.LIFE IN AN OLD HOUSE NOW IS
 JUST LIKE LIVING IN A MODERN HOUSE AS 
 IT HAS ALL THE SAME AMENITIES.
