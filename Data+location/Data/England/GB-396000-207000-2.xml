		<title>02THE VILLAGE,WINSTONE</title>
		<content> Winstone has a population of 228,18%  
 are under 16 and 22% are of           
 pensionable age .The village is set on
 a slight hill just 6 miles from       
 Cirencester.It has a combination of   
 old and new houses as well as         
 Fossfields which are Council houses , 
 built since 1950.Some of the newer    
 houses are very modern designs which  
 seem out of character with the stone  
 cottages in the centre.The village    
 name has 3 possible derivations :     
 perhaps a battle was fought and won   
 here,it could have been a Saxon Hamlet
 whose chief was Wynn or,as some       
 villagers believe,the village was the 
 home of Belgian Refugees who made     
 wine.About 100yards East of the       
 village is the old Manor Farm where   
 local people say the village          
 began.Across the field are two        
 beautiful barns,both listed buildings.</content>
