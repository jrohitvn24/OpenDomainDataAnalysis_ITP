 The houses were built by the Harlow   
 Development Corporation and have now  
 been handed over to Harlow District   
 Council. In Little Parndon there are  
 four main types of housing:           
                                       
{Terraced. Most houses are this type.  
{Flats.    There are two blocks.       
{Houses.   Mostly semi-detached.       
{Maisonettes. A few of these.          
                                       
 Most of the property is rented from   
 the HDC.                              
 As Little Parndon was built about 30  
 years ago, there is a shortage of     
 garages in the area as the present    
 rate of car ownership had not been    
 anticipated.  Many cars have to be    
 parked on the roads at night.
