 is in the upstairs room. It is        
 reputed to be that of a man who fell  
 through the roof and broke his neck.  
  One day a boy called Kevin went to   
 the{Bedford Hall}with his dad. They   
 unlocked the door and went inside.    
 They went up the stairs and past      
 doors. They eventually came to a      
 door and went in. They looked around  
 and heard a noise and a record-       
 player was turned on.They went down   
 stairs, shut the door and heard some  
 scratching noises so they went back   
 home bewildered.                      
  At{Elder House Farm}when the horse   
 keepers used to go to feed the        
 livestock at 5am they always found a  
 light on. One morning they decided    
 to go to see if they could find out   
 what was happening.{Daisy the cow}had 
 decided she would turn the light on!  </content>
