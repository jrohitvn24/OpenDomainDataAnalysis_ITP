		<title>13 FORESTRY IN BERE FERRERS</title>
		<content>   Years ago the woodland that is now  
 Fountain Forestry was owned by the    
 Tavistock monks.                      
  Most of the trees are Douglas Fir and
 Norway Spruce;there are a few Japanese
 Larch and Sycamore.Webber's Wood used 
 to be Spindle trees,but all that it is
 good for is firewood.It has been cut  
 and resown with Douglas Fir.There used
 to be a nursery in Webbers Wood.The   
 forest is nine hundred metres long,it 
 has deer,fox,badgers and other mammals
 living in it.                         
   Sycamore and other copse trees are  
 pruned at 5 years and felled at 12yrs.
 for tree and fencing stakes,as are fir
 and spruce sometimes.Lumberjacks spray
 felled trees with a chemical to stop  
 them from rotting.The Forestry Manager
 is a conservationist and tries to     
 prevent individual trees from being   
 destroyed needlessly.                 </content>
