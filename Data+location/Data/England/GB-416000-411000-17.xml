		<title>17THE ROUND HOUSE.</title>
		<content> The Round House is shaped like a toll 
 house.It was the Lodge House for the  
 Masonic Hall.The horse men rested     
 there while the Gentlemen met at the  
 Masonic Hall.After the building was   
 a Lodge House it was a butchers.After 
 being the butchers it was a tailors   
 and is now a shop that sells material.
 It is a sewers paradise. Mr and Mrs   
 Hollier who own the shop now buy their
 material from Trencherfields Mill in  
 Wigan.When they buy their cloth from  
 the mill they buy it by weight.When   
 they sell the cloth they sell by      
 weight.Smallish pieces cost 10 pence  
 an ounce.As the pieces get larger they
 get more expensive per ounce.It is    
 quite unusual to buy material by the  
 ounce.You usually buy it by the yard.
