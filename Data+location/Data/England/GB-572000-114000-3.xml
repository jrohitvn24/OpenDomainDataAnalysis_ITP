		<content> THE VILLAGE OF BATTLE CONTAINS MANY   
 TYPES OF{SHOP.}WE ASKED THE OWNERS OF 
 SEVERAL GIFT SHOPS ABOUT TRADE IN     
 A{TOURIST}AREA. MOST TOLD US THAT THE 
 BUSIEST TIME OF THE YEAR WAS BETWEEN  
 EASTER AND SEPTEMBER, WITH ANOTHER    
 RUSH JUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS. MOST      
 TOURISTS BUY ONLY SMALL SOUVENIERS    
 SUCH AS POTTERY ORNAMENTS OR SWEETS   
 BUT THOSE FROM ABROAD, ESPECIALLY FROM
 THE U.S.A. SPENT MUCH MORE AND        
 FAVOURED ANTIQUES OR PRINTS OF THE    
 ABBEY. MOST OF THE TOURIST SHOPS ARE  
 AS NEAR THE ABBEY GATE AS POSSIBLE    
 BECAUSE TOURISTS TEND TO GO INTO THE  
 FIRST SHOPS THEY SEE. THEY DO NOT SEEM
 TO GO DOWN THE SIDE STREETS VERY OFTEN
 PERHAPS BECAUSE THEY ARE SCARED OF    
 GETTING LOST.
