		<title>01REVIEW OF CENTRAL SUNDERLAND</title>
		<content> This D Block of{Central Sunderland}   
 consists of an{Urban landscape}       
 containing residential commercial and 
 industrial activities.The{River Wear} 
 forms a border on the north side of   
 this D block and although the block   
 contains urban growth and development 
 as one moves west across this block it
 is possible to identify the present   
 position of housing communications,   
 transport and trade in relation to    
 local history.The nine schools        
 involved in working within this D     
 block chose eighteen areas of interest
 which it was felt would present a     
 detailed yet concise picture of the   
 present day life style of an          
 individual living in Central          
 Sunderland.Each school studied two    
 areas of interest across the whole D  
 block.                                
                                       </content>
