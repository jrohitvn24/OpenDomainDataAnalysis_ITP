 and football.There is also a sauna,   
 solarium and a cafe.There are seperate
 changing rooms for the swimmers and   
 people using the sports hall.         
     Originally,the building was just a
 Public baths,and swimming is still the
 most popular activity.There are two   
 pools,a small one for learners,and a  
 large pool.At weekends activities for 
 children are organised.On three       
 evenings Darwen Swimming Club meet,and
 sometimes there is water polo.        
     Most of the other sports take

 be booked in advance_it would be      
 rather difficult to play badminton and
 football at the same time!            </content>
