		<content> To secure a{Maypole}villagers         
 'ear-mark' a suitable tree towards the
 end of April.This is usually stolen   
 during the night from a neighbouring  
 village,brought home and 'rinded'     
 (bark stripped) under cover of        
 darkness before being raised through  
 the night of April 31st. For some     
 years traditional Maypoles like this  
 have been seen in Lanreath and Pelynt.
 The aim is to keep your own pole      
 throughout May.Men keep guard day and 
 night and only when the vigil is      
 relaxed can the pole be stolen and    
 brought home to be erected in another 
 village.In modern times chain saws and
 diggers have been used.Before,men     
 removed poles by hand. In latter years
 poles have been stolen and hidden in  
 trees,churches and potato rows.In the 
 1940s a set of skittles and ball was  
 carved from a Maypole.                </content>
