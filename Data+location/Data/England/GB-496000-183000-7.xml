		<content> LOOKING BACK 50 YEARS IN FULMER       
                                       
 She remembered 50 years ago warming   
 herself at the blacksmith's fire on   
 the way home from school.The homes had
 neither running water or electricity. 
 Oil lamps were used for lighting and  
 the water was carried from the village
 pump. Milk was collected twice a day  
 from the village farm and the bread   
 was baked in the village bakery.Quite 
 a lot of sweets could be bought for a 
 farthing. This is the equivalent of a 
 tenth of a new pence. To-day a bar of 
 chocolate costs 18p.                  
   The road wasn't even made up and    
 there was no bus service they had to  
 walk.                                 
   There was an old couple with a      
 donkey and cart who gathered herbs and
 blackberries to sell in Gerrards      
 Cross. Times have changed.            </content>
