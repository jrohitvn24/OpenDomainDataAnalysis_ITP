		<content>Polite observance of convention is     
important to families in the area.A    
survey by school children discovered   
that they are all being trained to     
behave in a similar manner.Elbows are  
not allowed on tables,it is considered 
rude.Generally guests at table are     
expected to wait until all are served .
Most people expect younger members of a
group to be polite,hold open doors,and 
give their seats to elderly relatives. 
Eating off a knife is forbidden and    
holding a fork the right way round is  
important,as is tipping a bowl away    
from the holder.                       
     It is important to say:PLEASE:,   
:THANK YOU:and:EXCUSE ME: in all the   
right places.When somebody sneezes the 
response is:BLESS YOU:.Greeting people 
with:GOOD MORNING:or:GOOD AFTERNOON:or 
just:HELLO:is polite.Speaking with a   
mouth full of food is definitely taboo.</content>
