		<content> The Anglo-Saxons probably built a     
 small church here, but a small red    
 sandstone arch in the west wall of the
 vicarage garden is all that is visible
 evidence of the Norman building.The   
 present building was begun in 1304 at 
 the command of the Bishop of Exeter.  
    In 1610 Bishop Stapledon caused the
 additions to be made to make the fine 
 towered edifice it is today.The most  
 interesting parts of our church are   
 the Rood Screen that was madein the   
 15th century and restored in 1891 in  
 beautifully carved oak,and the bells  
 first hung in the 1550's.The clock is 
 worked by weights which have to be    
 wound up each week with a big         
 handle.There is also a rare parvise   
 over the porch, a kind of room where  
 visiting clergy could stay.We have    
 also 'rubbed' the monumental brass on 
 the outside of the chancel wall.      </content>
