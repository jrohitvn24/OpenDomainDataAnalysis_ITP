		<title>11Whitworth Rush Cart :1</title>
		<content>   Every September, as part of the     
 Whitworth Fair celebrations, a horse  
 drawn cart, decorated with heather and
 rushes passes through the streets of  
 Whitworth.                            
                                       
   The procession started approximately
 300-400 years ago. In those days      
 Parish churches, each surrounded by   
 small villages, were draughty and     
 damp. The rushes were used for warmth 
 and acted as a carpet and in muddy    
 weather they helped to keep the church
 dry.                                  
                                       
   Each hamlet cut rushes and took them
 to church each September because it   
 was harvest and almost winter. The    
 ceremony became a holiday occasion for
 the community. All the village turned 
 out with all the men in costume and   
 each village had its own dance.       </content>
