		<content>     The churchyard has a most         
 interesting gravestone not only in    
 design but because of the story behind
 it.                                   
     The grave is that of a poet       
 William Ernest Henley, his wife Anna  
 and his daughter Margaret Emma who    
 died when she was only six. Although  
 not a native of the area, family      
 friends lived in the village and      
 Margaret spent much of her childhood  
 there and, when she died, her         
 parents decided to bury her in a place
 she loved.                            
     Another family friend of the      
 Henley's was the writer J.M.Barrie and
 he was especially fond of Margaret.   
 She called him her FWENDY having      
 difficulty saying FRIEND. When he     
 wrote his most famous book 'Peter Pan'
 he called his character WENDY, in     
 memory of his little 'FWENDY'.        </content>
