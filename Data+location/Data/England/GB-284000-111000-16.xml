		<content> There are many supporters, both       
 riders and followers, of local hunts. 
 Cub-hunting on foot starts the first  
 week in September. Tiverton Foxhounds 
 meet twice-weekly from November to    
 March,{35-40 riders moving off at 11am
{Holcombe Rogus Beagles pack hunts with
{huntsmen and followers on foot.       
{Tiverton Staghounds attract spectators
{from miles around.                    
{One family keeps Welsh Mountain ponies
{and takes part in equestrian events.  
{Darts, skittles and pool teams from   
{the Cruwys Arms, Pennymoor, compete   
{against other pubs and clubs during   
{the winter. Discos in the Parish Hall 
{are very popular with the young.      
{Pre-Christmas whist-drives attract all
{age-groups. Golf-players have to      
{travel to the nearest course at       
{Tiverton. Some very good gardeners    
{show their produce at the Flower Show.</content>
