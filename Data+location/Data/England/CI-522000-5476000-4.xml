		<title>04  HOW L'EREE HAS CHANGED</title>
		<content> At one time it was all sand dunes and 
 bunkers. Now there all car parks that 
 have been flattened out. It has walls 
 that people can sit on. It has        
 ice-cream stands that sell            
 ice-creams,drinks and crisps. There is
 also a{cafe}at which you can have     
 anything from a spade to an ice-cream 
 or salad, from a cold drink to a      
 coffee or{tea in a basket}to take on  
 the beach. Across from the cafe is    
 another cafe which is also a          
 restaurant. Up the road is yet another
 cafe,but here you can have drinks and 
{fish and chips},a great delicacy      
 enjoyed by the tourists and locals    
 alike. There is a bus stop by L'Eree  
 beach. There is a road that leads to  
 the causeway to{Lihou Island}.There   
 are also German bunkers on the        
 headland built with concrete,iron and 
 slate.       By{Charlotte Gallienne   </content>
