		<content>  {Lower Darnford Farmhouse}is owned by
 a man who lives in London.It is rented
 to schools and families.Our school    
 rented it for four weeks,starting from
 May 11th.The other buildings and      
 fields are owned by{Mr.Sankey}from    
{Brow Farm.                            
   Most of our ten and eleven year olds
 stay for three nights in groups of    
 about twelve,with two or three        
 teachers.                             
   We find out about the area.We work  
 at the farm and carry on at school.We 
 cook our own meals and do all the     
 chores ourselves.                     
   The farm has on the ground floor    
 a kitchen,toilet,lounge and workroom. 
 Upstairs there are four bedrooms, a   
 bathroom,two toilets and a shower.    
   The house was built out of brick in 
 about 1875.It has changed quite a lot.
