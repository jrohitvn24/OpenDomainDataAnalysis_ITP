		<title>08BUILDINGS ON ARNE PENINSULA</title>
		<content>   The oldest building,St.Nicholas'    
 chapel,which comes under the Parish of
 Wareham,was built in the thirteenth   
 century with a small nave and chancel 
 under one roof with a porch and       
 buttress.Services are held every      
 other Sunday.The next oldest building 
 is the eighteenth century School House
 which had one teacher and an annual   
 attendance of eleven in 1787.Most     
 dwellings were roofless during the    
 Second World War when the peninsula   
 was evacuated and used to lure enemy  
 bombers away from Poole.The nine      
 dwellings today include Arne Manor    
 which is mid-Victorian,Arne Studio,The
 Old Orchard and a modern farmhouse    
 near the church.The 100 acre farm     
 concentrates on grassland and         
 beef.Only a family farm could be      
 profitable on Arne today.
