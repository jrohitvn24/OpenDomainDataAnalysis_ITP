		<title>18A Day in the Life of.....(2)</title>
		<content> ..........................LUKE, Age 11
   My dad wakes me up and I have my    
 breakfast of toast and peanut butter. 
 Then I get dressed, have a wash and   
 clean my teeth. I walk to school at   
 twenty to nine and get there ten      
 minutes later. We play football. We   
 start the school day by reading and   
 then we usually have an assembly.     
 After that we do different work each  
 day until dinner: I like writing      
 stories most. School lunches are often
 quite tasty, especially thin sausages.
 In the afternoon we usually do art or 
 project work or games:I enjoy painting
 and sketching. After school I play at 
 the rec. on the climbing frame or ride
 my BMX round the village. We made a   
 track in the woods but some older boys
 broke down the jumps. I watch telly   
 for an hour and go to bed at 9.0 p.m.,
 or later if I can.                    </content>
