 Monks in 1150 was one of the most     
 important monastic houses in the land.
 After the dissolution in 1539 it      
 passed to the Crown,was leased to     
 various farming families and in 1581  
 passed to the Harrington family,under 
 whose care Princess Elizabeth Stuart  
 lived for 5 years.In 1622 the Abbey   
 was sold to the Craven family where it
 remained until 1922.After various     
 owners, the Abbey was bought by       
 Coventry City Council and is now used 
 for mediaeval banquets.The grounds are
 used for many events:vintage cars,    
 archery,craft fairs,flower shows and  
 folk festivals.The Abbey employs 18   
 people,5 live in the park,the rest    
 travel from Coventry.About 250,000    
 visitors enjoy the Abbey and it is
