		<content>{SCREMERSTON}is a small village in     
{North Northumberland}situated about   
 two miles south of the historic       
 border town of Berwick-upon-Tweed.The 
 A1 trunk road used to pass through the
 centre of the of the village but in   
 1983 a bypass was completed and now   
 only local traffic use the former busy
 trunk route.                          
    The area is mainly arable farmland,
 sheep and cattle are grazed and the   
 crops grown are barley,wheat and oats.
    To the east of the area is the main
 East Coast railway line linking{London
 and{Edinburgh}and still further east  
 is the North Sea.Up to about the 1950s
 there were very few houses in the     
 village but after that some housing   
 development took place when the local 
 Council built about 70 houses.Twenty  
 four flats for old people were built  
 as part of a sheltered housing scheme.</content>
