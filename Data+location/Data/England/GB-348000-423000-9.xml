		<title>09LONGTON FETE DAY</title>
		<content>   {Longton Fete}is held in late May.  
 There is a procession of floats from  
 'Happidog' car park along Chapel Lane 
 and Liverpool Road to the Victory     
 Memorial Field for the crowning of the
 Fete Queen. Children dance round the  
 maypole and charities run side shows  
 like hoop-la, roll-a-penny and        
 tombola, for their own funds.         
    The floats in the procession are   
 decorated by Guides, Scouts, youth    
 clubs and playgroups. There are two   
 brass bands and the Scout band plays  
 for the walkers in fancy dress. The   
 Queen is previously chosen from the   
 teenagers of the district and walks,  
 with her escort, at the head of the   
 procession followed by the Rose Queens
 and Harvest Queen from the Churches.  
    When the procession reaches the    
 field everyone gets a free drink of   
 tea or orange at the Bowling Club.    </content>
