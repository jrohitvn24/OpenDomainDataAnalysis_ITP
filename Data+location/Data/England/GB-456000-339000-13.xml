		<title>13NOTTINGHAM - THE FOREST</title>
		<content>  The Forest is a park used for lots of
 different things.Every October they   
 hold Goose Fair there, a huge fair    
 which has been held for the last 600  
 years .They also have exhibitions,    
 circuses and many other events there. 
                                       
 Its called the Forest but it isn't a  
 forest. In the olden days Sherwood    
 Forest started there.                 
 It has a BMX course that's just been  
 made, a putting green and bowling     
 greens.                               
                                       
 Our school uses it for our games      
 because our field is full of litter   
 and broken glass.I go there to play   
 football and cricket on a big flat bit
 of grass.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
