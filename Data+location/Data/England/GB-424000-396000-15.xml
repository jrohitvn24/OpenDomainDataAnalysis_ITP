		<content>   THE VEGETATION RANGES FROM HIGH     
 HEATHER MOORLAND WITH BILBERRY AND    
 MOUNTAIN ASH, DOTTED WITH SMALL MARSHY
 AREAS WITH SEDGES AND COTTON GRASS CUT
 BY RIVERS.  THIS AREA IS WINDSWEPT,   
 OPEN AND HARSH.  THIS LEADS TO ROUGH  
 PASTURE LAND WITH POOR GRASSES,       
 BRACKEN AND GORSE, GRAZED BY SHEEP AND
 ENCLOSED BY STONE WALLS.  THERE IS    
 LOWER FLATTER LAND WITH CULTIVATED    
 GRASSES FOR CATTLE AS WELL AS USED FOR
 GROWING CEREALS AND POTATOES.         
   THE RIVER 'LITTLE DON' IS POLLUTED  
 HEAVILY AS IT PASSES THE STEEL WORKS  
 WHILE NEARBY 'EWDEN BECK' IS A CLEAR, 
 COLD, ACID MOORLAND STREAM WITH A     
 STEEP SIDED DENSELY DECIDUOUS WOODED  
 VALLEY.  THE UNDERLYING ROCKS ARE     
 ACIDIC, SANDSTONE AND MILLSTONE GRIT. 
 THE SOIL IN GENERAL IS SHALLOW AND    
 RATHER POOR.THE AIR IS MINIMALLY      
 POLLUTED BY THE STEEL WORKS.          </content>
