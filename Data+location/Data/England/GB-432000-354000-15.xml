 in our area,only one still in use- {  
{CLIFF QUARRY}- owned by Butterley     
 Aggregrates.The disused quarries are -
{HILTS QUARRY}_This is owned by Rolls  
 Royce of Derby and was used for toxic 
 waste.It operates every day but Sunday
 ,but is not open to the public.It is  
 next to the Junior School and there   
 are warning signs on the perimeter    
 fence.                                
{OLD QUARRY}_ This is due to be open   
 any day as a public rubbish dump which
 is causing local residents some       
 concern.                              
{QUARRY NEAR THE CHURCH}_This is owned 
 by Granwood and is not open to the    
 public although people do tip rubbish 
 over the fence illegally.             
 In addition there is {DUKE'S QUARRY}  
 which is now a pleasant area for      
 walkers.                              </content>
