		<title>04The Residents.</title>
		<content> When we were on the island there were 
 about 15 residents working for the    
 Landmark Trust- but numbers vary      
 seasonally and according to on-going  
 building work and other developments. 
 (The South Light has a complement of 3
 keepers and they are relieved monthly)
 Most of the Landmark employees do a   
 variety of jobs -many of them to do   
 directly with the tourist trade:      
 servicing and maintaining the visitors
 accomodation,transporting luggage and 
 provisions,manning the office,shop and
 tavern... One person acts as brewer   
 and market gardener-and recently      
 someone has been employed to run a    
 restaurant upstairs in the Tavern.    
 The other main activities are farming 
 and the improvement and repair of     
 buildings.The water supply and sewage 
 systems have also been improved and an
 aero-generator has been installed.    </content>
