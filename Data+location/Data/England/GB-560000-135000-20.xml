		<content>                                       
   Wadhurst Primary School was given   
 an area to survey which involved a    
 ten-minute car drive from the school. 
   During a week when many of the      
 children's school friends were        
 visiting France, the teachers managed 
 to borrow two minibuses from Uplands  
 Community College (Wadhurst Secondary 
 Comprehensive School), so that thirty 
 children were able to "saturate" the  
 area in a five-day period.   So the   
 children unable to visit France felt  
 that the Domesday Project had proved  
 an excellent and enjoyable substitute!
