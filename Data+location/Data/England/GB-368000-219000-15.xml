		<content> The provision of new{sewers}for       
{Longhope and Huntley}in the early     
 1970's led to the building of new     
 estates. Many new houses were built   
 in{Longhope}on land previously used   
 for orchards. Many of the buyers had  
 young families and wanted to live in  
 the country yet close to the city of{ 
{Gloucester}.To the local people this  
 meant a change from traditional       
 villagers with people from many areas 
 of Britain moving in as jobs etc.     
 dictated. Most of the new houses are  
{owner-occupied}although some{council  
{housing}is provided and some older    
 houses are tied to the farms or       
 Church. Small gardens are supplemented
 by allotments, the surrounding fields 
 and open countryside give a feeling of
 space.
