		<content>      15 Woodstock Crescent is a       
 semi-detached house on the            
 Beechwood Estate. The house was built 
 approximately 14 years ago. The houses
 on this road are almost all the same  
 but there are a few bungalows and     
 detached houses.                      
      This house is on the corner of   
 the road and has a front, side and    
 back garden. The front garden is small
 and the side and back gardens are     
 average. The front and side gardens   
 are surrounded by a hedge, the back is
 partioned off by a fence. There is a  
 garage at the back of the garden.     
      The house has six rooms -        
 lounge/dining area, kitchen, bathroom,
 three bedrooms. It also has a hallway.
 There are four windows at the front,  
 one at the side and four at the back.
