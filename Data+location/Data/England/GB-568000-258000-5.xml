		<title>05TALKING ABOUT HALL FARM</title>
		<content> We went to see Mr Robert Claydon the  
 farmer at Hall Farm, which is near    
 the Silverley church remains. He      
 showed us around his arable farm. They
 have 1000 acres which are used for    
 barley, sugar beet, and wheat. They   
 send some of their food to the people 
 in Ethiopia who are starving. Most of 
 the corn is stored in a big barn, and 
 goes off to a corn merchant. There are
 some meadows for grazing.             
 They use to have working horses and   
 pigs but they now only have horses    
 which don't work.There are six and a  
 half helpers:  six work full time     
 and one works part time.There are ten 
 machines altogether: six tractors, one
 digger, one drill, one combine        
 harvester and one machine for heavy   
 lifting. There is a pond nearby to    
 drain water from the fields, with     
 a ditch leading to a local river.     </content>
