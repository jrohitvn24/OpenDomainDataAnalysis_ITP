 The College was founded 113 yers go   
 and housed in two separate buildings  
 11 miles apart in Shropshire. Seven   
 years ago it all came together and    
 moved to the former Teacher Training  
 College in Hereford.The College in    
 Hereford was officially opened in July
 1979 by Prince Charles.The College has
 had other famous visitors including   
 Yehudi Menuhin who opened the Sobell  
 Department piano tuning in May 1985.  
 Very few of the students are totally  
 blind.Most were not born blind but    
 have developed difficulties or had    
 accidents. Some students live out in  
 the town. They  study a great many    
 subjects and take "O" and "A" levels. 
 The College accepts any students, over
 the age of 16, if they can be helped. 
 Most stay 3 years and there are       
 usually 220 students at any one time. </content>
