		<content>  Colwall W.I. began in 1930 and has a 
 membership now of 65. Members meet    
 monthly and recent projects include   
 rebuilding seats and painting bus     
 shelters for the Best Kept Village    
 competition and improving Colwall     
 railway station in a joint scheme with
 B.R. The W.I. has also run a campaign 
 to encourage support for local shops  
 by supplying car-stickers.            
  Activities include drama, a rounders 
 team, a bowling team and an annual    
 pancake race. They also run classes   
 for craftwork, flower arranging and   
 spinning.                             
  The age range of members varies from 
 26 to 87 and it is a sign of the times
 that most members under 60 are in full
 or part-time employment. Unlike more  
 rural W.I.'s, Colwall has a high      
 percentage of professional and        
 business women.                       </content>
