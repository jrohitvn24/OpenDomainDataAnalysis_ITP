		<title>05Scalebyhill Chapel</title>
		<content>  In Scalebyhill stands the oldest     
 chapel on the Methodist Northwestern  
 circuit.The early 19th cent. Method-  
 ist preachers held field meetings     
 here, on a hilltop at the farm of a   
 Mr. Palmer.                           
  The first meetings were disrupted by 
 organised egg- and stone- throwing.   
 Once, a house was besieged until the  
 preacher hiding there gave himself up.
 He was thrown into a dungheap and     
 trampled.                             
  In 1828, Mr. Palmer built the small  
 stone on the site of the meetings. It 
 is still cared for by a descendant of 
 the family who lives in the village.
