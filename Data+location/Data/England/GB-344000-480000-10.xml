		<title>10Quicksands, Tidal Bore</title>
		<content> The Kent Estuary is most unstable;    
 wide, shallow and sandy. The river    
 Kent, rising 25 miles away in the     
 mountains of the Lake District is     
 quickly affected by heavy rainfall.   
 Consequently its channel constantly   
 changes, both in depth and direction; 
 its steep sides varying from a few    
 inches to several feet. This produces 
 hazardous conditions for visitors who 
 venture to wade or swim in the        
 estuary.                              
 The resultant{quicksands}are a source 
 of real danger, both to visitors and  
 to local residents. Warning signboards
 are erected at strategic points.      
 The large basin of Morecambe Bay      
 results in a{tidal bore}in the Kent   
 Estuary. It occurs approximately two  
 hours before high tide and can be very
 spectacular. A warning siren is       
 sounded at Arnside and Sandside.      </content>
