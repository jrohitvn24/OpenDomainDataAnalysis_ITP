		<title>11SOUTH PARADE PIER,SOUTHSEA.</title>
		<content>    Since 1879 when{South Parade Pier  
 was first opened it has been a        
 popular place for residents and       
 visitors. The pier has been burnt down
 twice, once in 1904 and again in 1974 
 when a film called 'Tommy' was being  
 made there.                           
    One of its main amenities is the   
{amusement arcade}with games for all   
 the family. There is a fortune teller 
 and outside there is a{children's     
{playground}and several shops. There is
 a{banqueting hall}where shows and     
 dances are held, a{restaurant}and two 
 bars which provide entertainment each 
 evening. There are boat trips and     
 people can fish from the pier.        
    Special events are held and every  
 summer{Miss Southsea}is judged. This  
 year there is another competition     
 called Miss In String to be judged at 
 the pier.                             </content>
