		<title>04The Rookery</title>
		<content> The{Rookery}was{built in 1727}as a    
 vicarage and the vicar lived there    
 with his{fourteen servants.}He moved  
 out some time later because the house 
 was too small for him.                
                                       
 In later years{another vicarage}was   
 built which is now called{Wellington  
{House.}The new wing added to The      
 Rookery was built on in 1879 which was
 in the time of{Sir Jonathan Backhouse}
 who lived there and was a{founder}of  
{Barclay's Bank.  Edward Backhouse}    
 lived in  The Rookery  after his      
 brother; he {was a scholar} who       
 translated Chinese}books into the     
 English language.                     
                                       
 The Rookery has changed quite a lot   
 over the years and{now}there is only  
{one part-time help}and she works ten  
 hours per week.                       </content>
