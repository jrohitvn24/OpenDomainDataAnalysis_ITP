		<content> P.C. Moffat is the community policeman
 for the Batford area.   He lives in   
 Tuffnells Way and as soon as he comes 
 out of his door he is on duty. He     
 walks and cycles around the area.  His
 warrant number is 841. He wears a     
 uniform that is dark blue. He has     
 silver polished buttons. His helmet is
 very hard and is good for rainy days. 
 It is made of compressed cork. He has 
 a truncheon which is made of oak. He  
 doesn't carry his truncheon much, just
 on the odd occasions. He has only hit 
 two people with his truncheon in the  
 20 years he has been in the police    
 force. P.C.Moffat was an engineer     
 before he became a policeman. He said 
 that real police work is not at all   
 like the serials we watch on          
 television. He enjoys his work very   
 much.
