		<content> Ruddles Brewery was founded in Langham
 in 1858.George Ruddle joined the      
 business in 1896,and his son,the late 
 Sir Kenneth Ruddle took over the firm 
 in 1945.The present Chairman is Tony  
 Ruddle,Sir Kenneth's son.The Brewery  
 is now a Public Company.Until the late
 1960's the company was a small        
 regional brewery supplying its own    
 tied houses as well as the trade.     
 Recently Ruddles sold its last public 
 house the "Noel Arms" at Langham and  
 is concentrating on new markets e.g.  
 grocery chains such as Sainsbury's and
 Waitrose.Using traditional brewing    
 methods Ruddles produce Ruddles       
 County,Rutland Bitter and Ruddles     
 Barley Wine.Whole aroma hops and high 
 quality malt are brewed in the modern 
 plant with the help of technological  
 aids.The firm has won many prizes for 
 its beer and packaging.               </content>
