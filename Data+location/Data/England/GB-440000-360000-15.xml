		<title>15THE TIBSHELF BLACKSMITH</title>
		<content> My brother-in-law is a blacksmith and 
 he runs his own business in Tibshelf. 
 He has got his own forge and his own  
 tools like hammers, long-handled      
 pliers and an anvil.                  
 When he is going to make a horseshoe  
 he takes a long bar of iron, chops a  
 piece off it and puts it into the     
 forge. When he gets it out he uses    
 long-handled pliers. It will be very  
 hot so that he can beat it into shape.
 He uses a hammer to get it into       
 the right shape. Then he has to make  
 the holes where the nails go.         
 Farmers don't use horses to work in   
 the fields these days, but there are  
 lots of people who ride horses for    
 fun. He shoes horses for people in    
 Tibshelf but he has a van and he also 
 goes round to other villages and to   
 horse shows.
