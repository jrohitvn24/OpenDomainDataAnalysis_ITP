		<title>07Industry in Billingham</title>
		<content> The agricultural division of ICI has  
 it's headquarters in Billingham. More 
 than half of the output of this       
 division is in the form of fertilizers
 for British farmers.                  
 In Billingham the plant covers 1100   
 acres which makes it one of the       
 largest in Europe and the latest      
 figures show that it employs 7000     
 people. Within the site there are 10  
 miles of major roads, 18 miles of     
 minor roads and 37 miles of railway   
 lines. Over 20 000 000 gallons of     
 water are used every day in the       
 manufacture of fertilizers, methanol, 
 carbon dioxide, ammonia and various   
 catalysts which ICI produces.         
 ICI began its links with Billingham in
 the 1920's and its name has been      
 synonymous with the town for many     
 years past and probably for many years
 to come.                              </content>
