		<content> Fenside is a lonely place, off the    
 beaten track. There are lots of little
 dykes that run across it into Barton  
 Broad. The roads that run through     
 Fenside are bumpy with grass often    
 growing through the surface. Beside   
 the roads are grazing meadows and     
 fields containing crops. The land     
 drains into Barton Broad. It is lonely
 to live down here and when it rains   
 the roads and gardens flood. Fenside  
 is a good place for fishing and       
 observing wildlife. It is peaceful and
 quiet for birds to nest. Butterflies, 
 moths and gnats are common during the 
 summer months. Other insects live here
 too, such as hornets and dragonflies. 
 In the woods men shoot wildfowl. It is
 also a good place for finding a wide  
 variety of wild flowers.
