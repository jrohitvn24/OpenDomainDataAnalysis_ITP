		<title>19Mischief Night</title>
		<content>   Mischief Night is on November 4th.  
 There were 7 of us down at the bottom 
 of the hill in Shakespeare Avenue     
 Campsall.We had two bangers and two   
 rockets and we went to Mr.Smith's     
 garden on the corner of Avenue Road.  
 We put one rocket in Mr.Smith's garden
 and lit it.It went up in the air and  
 came down the chimney of the house.   
   We ran down to Dave's shops on      
 Bourne Road. Workers had been building
 houses and they had dug the ground up.
 It had been raining and the mud was   
 very wet. So we got handfulls of the  
 mud and threw it at the windows of    
 some houses. Then we started letting  
 bangers off outside some houses and   
 smashing milk bottles by the shops.   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
