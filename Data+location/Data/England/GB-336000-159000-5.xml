		<content>    Miss Fazakerley died in l887       
 leaving a building in East Street for 
 use as a village Fire Station. If it  
 stopped being a Fire Station then the 
 building was to be sold and the money 
 divided between the poor of the       
 Parish. So to save the building for   
 the Parish to use as a Museum, the    
 Fire Station must have a Fire Brigade.
    In l984 a group of people formed   
 the Friends of Banwell Fire Station.  
 Their aim was to run a Museum in the  
 Fire Station building and to raise    
 money for its maintenance.  A         
 volunteer fire crew was also formed.  
    On l4th September l985 the Fire    
 Station was reopened after a few years
 of closure. The opening was followed  
 by a massive Jumble Sale at Church    
 House, all the proceeds were donated  
 to the Fire Station, Â£500 at the last 
 count.                                </content>
