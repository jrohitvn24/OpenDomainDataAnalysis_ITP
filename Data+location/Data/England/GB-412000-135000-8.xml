		<content>   How do old people get to the bus    
 stop ? Young people can easily walk up
 a hill to the bus stop, but older     
 people cannot walk to the bus stop.   
 Most of the older people cannot drive 
 because they are not rich enough to   
 afford a car. Some old people have    
 daughters and sons who could drive    
 them to the bus stop but others have  
 none at all so they stay at home and  
 never go out to town, except to the   
 village shop or the greengrocer who   
 goes around the village once a week.  
 The bus does not go down into the     
 village but stays up at the top of the
 village and expects the old people to 
 walk up the hill to catch it.         
   I think all country buses should go 
 down into the village so the old      
 people can have a chance to go out to 
 town.
