Ashton has a general village shop and  
Post Office and a village hall.It also 
has a small school which has been under
threat of closing for some time.Roade  
is only on the edge of our area so is  
dealt with elsewhere.Hartwell has a    
Post Office and general shop,a school  
of 180,a Parish Hall,playing field and 
is close to Salcey Forest for country  
interests.Ashton has decided to build  
more expensive houses and generally has
fewer problems from the lack of playing
field space and social activities than 
Hartwell.It has a strong rugby union &amp; 
cricket club which also houses many    
other activities.Hartwell has grown to 
be the much larger village but has not 
much to offer its new residents by way 
of things to do.There is no feeling of 
belonging or responsibility for the    
village.     Chad Shakespeare,11.      </content>
