		<title>12FOX HUNTING , HAUGHTON AREA.</title>
		<content>   Our area is the territory of the    
 Cheshire Hunt, based at Sandiway. Of  
 the 295 inhabitants of the area, only 
 about 10 regularly ride to hounds, but
 as many as 100 people, mainly from    
 outside the area, follow by car and on
 foot and only 2 landowners refuse the 
 hunt access to their property. The    
 hunt is funded by the annual          
 subscriptions of its members - Â£350   
 for farmers and Â£700 for others.      
 The season lasts from October,when    
 cubbing starts, to February. Regular  
 hunting days are Tuesday and Saturday,
 with Thursday reserved as a "bye-day".
 March sees the opening of the season  
 of Point-to-Point races; horses which 
 have been regularly seen out by a hunt
 official are eligible to compete. The 
 high points of the social calendar are
 the Hunt Balls for farmers and members
 in Nantwich Civic Hall in January.    </content>
