		<title>09Animals In Thorpe Hesley</title>
		<content> An interesting part of the  ecology of
 Thorpe Hesley is Mangam's pond formed 
 by water soaking away from the pits.It
 contains lots of species of water     
 plants animals and insects including  
 an endangered species.The Fire Crested
 newt breeds in Mangam's pond  and     
 this is one of the few places it can  
 be found. There are toads, frog,      
 mallard, Great diving                 
 beetles,sticklebacks, dragon flys,    
 pond skaters,  nymphs, daphnia, grass 
 snake,small eels and waterboatmen.Some
 people in the village are using the   
 pond as a dump.Some of the things they
 throw away are toxic and are dangerous
 to pond life.When the water from the  
 surrounding fields soaks in the       
 nitrogen from fertilizer it makes the 
 pond weed grow and cover the pond.
