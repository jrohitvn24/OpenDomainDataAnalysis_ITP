		<title>04OPINIONS OF MARTON/NUNTHORPE</title>
		<content> Marton and Nunthorpe is a pleasant    
 area in which to live. The shops and  
 facilities of Middlesbrough are within
 easy reach yet we escape the smoke of 
 the industry. Within easy reach are   
 Roseberry Topping,The Eston Hills and 
 Cleveland Hills. Within our area there
 are few recreational facilities, but  
 these can  be catered for in          
 Middlesbrough. There is a great       
 variety of housing. One house looks   
 very old and has a thatched roof,     
 while many houses have been built     
 within the past ten to fifteen years. 
 The newer houses must maintain 'open  
 plan' gardens and many residents would
 like greater privacy. There is a      
 considerable amount of turnover of    
 residents on the estates with new     
 families moving in constantly.
