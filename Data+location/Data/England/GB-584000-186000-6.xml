		<title>06THE WAYS WE WORSHIP &amp; PRAY</title>
		<content> Most people who live near our school  
 attend Church of England,Baptist or   
 Catholic church services.Some observe 
 different ways of worship;Hindu,World 
 Wide Church of God,Muslim and         
 Jehovah's Witness.                    
 Cara is a Christian,she goes to Sunday
 School on Sunday morning where they   
 discuss things from the Bible.Her     
 parents listen to a service and sing  
 hymns.At 9.45 the children come in &amp;  
 they all take Holy Communion,that is  
 when you take the Bread &amp; Wine.Cara   
 has been confirmed,that means she is a
 part of the Church and God.The Bread  
 &amp; Wine represent the Flesh &amp; Blood of 
 Jesus Christ.They speak to God in     
 Church because that is God's House.The
 Christians take their name from Christ
 and try to live as he would like them 
 to.
