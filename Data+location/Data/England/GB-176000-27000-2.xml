		<title>02MAWNAN OLD CHURCH</title>
		<content> The name Mawnan came from a monk named
{St.Maunanus}who was supposed to have  
 come to Mawnan in the 6th century.He  
 used the sanctuary well.The{church}was
 dedicated to him it was built of      
 granite in the 13th century on the    
 site of an ancient earthwork.The      
 church is in a beautiful position     
 over-looking the mouth of the         
 Helford river.Once it was going to be 
 whitewashed so that it could be used  
 as a lighthouse for shipping but it   
 never happened.Many people visit the  
 church which was restored inthe 19th  
 century.People come from different    
 countries to admire the view,to look  
 at the church, the embroidered        
 kneelers and to study the gravestones 
 for mention of their ancestors.The    
 church should have been built at      
 Nansidwell but the'little men'moved   
 the stone to the Toll Headland.       </content>
