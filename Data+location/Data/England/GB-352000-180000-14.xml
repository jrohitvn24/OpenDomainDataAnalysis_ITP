		<content> Almost the whole area is low lying    
 marshland with rich alluvium deposit. 
 It has been drained by a criss cross  
 system of rhines which drain into the 
 Severn and protected by a coastal     
 embankment. The south west section of 
 the area is crossed by a limestone    
 anticline largely wooded with non     
 coniferous trees.The north west       
 section is a small coastal region     
 bordering the Severn Estuary. The     
 river bed consists of mudflats, gravel
 banks and sand. Along the edge of the 
 river is a grassy area called         
 Chittening Warth. There are small     
 farms on the low lying land where the 
 fields and lanes are lined with       
 hedges, willows and some mature trees.
