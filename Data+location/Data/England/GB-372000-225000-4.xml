		<title>04Car Parking in Newent</title>
		<content>  The majority of cars parked in Newent
 are the result of:                    
   {1.}People from outlying areas      
 coming into Newent to do shopping.    
   {2.}People who live in the centre   
 of Newent in older properties that do 
 not have a garage.                    
{   3.}Tourists during Spring and      
 Summer                                
  There is concern about the amount of 
 car parking in the narrow streets and 
 problems of safety. Recently a system 
 of parking restrictions has been      
 introduced in the form of double      
 yellow lines marked on the roadside   
 indicating no-parking.                
  It is also felt that local car parks 
 are only just adequate and that with  
 the increased volume of traffic there 
 should be traffic-safeguards because  
 of the number of elderly people and   
 mothers with young children in Newent.</content>
