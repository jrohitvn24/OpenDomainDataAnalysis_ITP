 Because the buses don't run very often
 and people either walk to Buxton or   
 use cars we decided to do a traffic   
 survey of Harpur Hill Road &amp; the A515.
                                       
 On the A515 between noon &amp; 1pm more   
 vehicles (62) went to Buxton than     
 towards Ashbourne (43), possibly it   
 was market day-Wednesday-in Buxton.   
 The road did not seem very busy but   
 there were quite a few lorries,       
 especially quarry trucks. 3 cars      
 turned down Staden Lane to Cowdale    
 and 2 turned off towards Harpur Hill. 
 In the morning Harpur Hill Rd was most
 busy between 8.50-9.00am. with people 
 going to school or college. Traffic   
 was 75% lighter 10 minutes later. 144 
 vehicles  went up to Harpur Hill and  
 112 came down between 8.40 &amp; 9.00am.  
 There were 25 pedestrians             </content>
