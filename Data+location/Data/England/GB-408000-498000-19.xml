		<title>19TREES IN DISTRICT OF MARSKE.</title>
		<content> Marske is well known for the beauty of
 it's trees. As part of an old estate  
 there are unusual number of mature    
 hardwoods, some of them specimen      
 trees. A few elms are still alive but 
 most have succumbed to Dutch Elms     
 Disease. There is an avenue of old    
 Limes &amp; some unusual Conifers in the  
 grounds of Marske Hall. There are     
 plantings of Larch &amp; small areas of   
 mixed wood &amp; some Natural             
 Regeneration Elderberry, Silver Birch 
 &amp; Alder. These are undergrown with    
 Blackberry Bushes, Briar &amp; Sloe. Along
 with these bushes there are Hawthorn, 
 Mountain Ash, Pussy Willow, Ash and   
 Sycamore in the hedgerows.
