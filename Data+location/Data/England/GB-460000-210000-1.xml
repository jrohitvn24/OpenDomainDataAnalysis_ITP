		<title>01General Description - Oakley</title>
		<content>  he area is predominately either farm 
crops-maize,wheat,rape and barley,or   
rough pasture for grazing of cattle and
sheep.However much of the land is      
covered by forest and nature reserves  
with rare species of flora and fauna.  
There are numerous public footpaths    
across the area.Apart from in the      
village centre, most buildings are     
connected with farming.                
Buildings in Oakley date from 1660 with
many timber-framed, thatched           
cottages.The village has grown         
considerably over recent years with a  
large new owner-occupier housing       
estate.There are  limited amenities in 
the area, which  include a primary     
school, village hall,supermaket, post  
office, garage, two pubs and several   
small nurseries.There is a remote      
sewage works,and remains of a second   
World War air strip.                   </content>
