		<content>    Ellendune shopping centre is       
 situated in the middle of Wroughton.  
 The age of the centre is about 15     
 years old. They built the shopping    
 centre so that journeys into Swindon  
 became less frequent as more people   
 moved to the village.                 
    The centre is a row of terraced    
 shops with housing facilities above.  
 It contains a fruit shop, hair        
 dressser, newsagents, butchers, ladies
 clothes, optician and supermarket. It 
 is built around two of a car park,    
 making it easy to shop.               
    A questionaire showed that most    
 people use the Ellendune for their    
 basic shopping,but two people bought  
 their bread in Swindon and everyone   
 shopped for large items such as       
 furniture in Swindon.
