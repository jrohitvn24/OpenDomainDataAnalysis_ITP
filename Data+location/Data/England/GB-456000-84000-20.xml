		<title>20RIVER YAR (EAST)</title>
		<content> The River Yar runs through the valley 
 at the northern edge of Newchurch and 
 through Alverstone village.  The      
 flatlands on either side of the river 
 have an abundance of plant life.      
 A walk along the old{RAILWAY TRACK,}  
 which runs along side the river       
 reveals this plant life.  Reedmace    
 (bullrush) one of Britains            
 disappearing plants can be seen in    
 great numbers, common watercress is   
 found everywhere and marsh marigolds  
 can also be seen.  The grass is lush  
 and the{MEADOWS}are used for cattle   
 and horses.                           
 If walkers are quiet, they will be    
 able to see water voles swimming about
 and kingfishers darting after insects 
 and fish. {DRAGONFLIES}dart over the  
 water in the summer and{WATER BIRDS}  
 swim happily with their young.
