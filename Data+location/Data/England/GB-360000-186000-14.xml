		<content> There are two sources of local news   
 for Olveston and Tockington. The      
 weekly paper called The Thornbury     
 Gazette and the Parish Magazine,      
 Meeting Point, which is printed       
 monthly.                              
 The Gazette is available every Friday 
 costing 17p. It mainly covers         
 Thornbury news items with some other  
 interesting local news. The week      
 ending 19 July 1985 included items    
 about a 74 year old Olveston man who  
 was involved in a car chase with the  
 Police. Another article included the  
 proposed expansion of Harnhill Quarry,
 Olveston.                             
 Mr.Turnbull is the new editor of the  
 Meeting Point and it is his job to    
 collate information that people like  
 to read. He also makes sure Church and
 diary dates are correct.His favourite 
 article is WELCOME introducing folk.  </content>
