		<content>   The River Ouse runs between huge    
 flood-banks;the level of water in the 
 banks is above the fields in many     
 places.When the peat is drained it    
 shrinks and so the fields are below   
 the river level.To prevent flooding   
 the river is embanked.The Ouse is     
 canalised here having been            
 straightened to make it easier to     
 navigate.                             
    The main embankment,Middle Fen     
 Bank, is a special feature,a          
 roddon.Thousands of years ago,when    
 streams and rivers ran through the    
 fens,silt carried in the streams was  
 deposited as the current              
 slackened.This silt gradually built up
 to form a core in the peat.When the   
 peat was drained these silt deposits  
 became small ridges called roddons.The
 main road from Ely to Prickwillow     
 follows another roddon.               </content>
