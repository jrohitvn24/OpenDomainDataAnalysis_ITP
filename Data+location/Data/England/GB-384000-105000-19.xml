		<title>19The Portman Hunt</title>
		<content>   Lord Portman's Hunt was sold in 1927
 to the Hunt Committee.The Kennels were
 built in 1889 &amp; are let by the Crown  
 Agents.The Hunt area is{North Dorset. 
   The Committee appoints the Master;he
 needs 8 horses to hunt the 3 days/week
 in the season. 45-50 couples are kept.
{The Portman Hunt}has between 40-50 who
 subscribe; half the costs of the Hunt 
 are raised by the Hunt Ball, jumble   
 sales &amp; other fundraising ventures.   
   The present Chairman hunts twice a  
 week in season &amp; keeps 2 horses.It is 
 his chief relaxation. As a farmer he  
 felt it was easier for him perhaps,but
 the Hunt had members from the Army,the
 professions &amp; youngsters via the Pony 
 Clubs.He agreed that hunting created  
 controversy.{Saboteurs}were rarely met
 -there was an episode in Wimborne when
 the Hunt met there. Controlling foxes 
 mattered. The Hunt created jobs too.  </content>
