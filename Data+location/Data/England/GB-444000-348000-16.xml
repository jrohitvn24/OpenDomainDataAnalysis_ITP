		<title>16Animals in Brinsley</title>
		<content> One very early morning lots of farm   
 animals such as cows,hens and goats   
 escaped from a farm nearby.           
   No one seemed to know where they    
 came from.They had come down a        
 footpath on King Drive.They had       
 broken down fences and trodden on     
 flowers.                              
 Someone who lived on Kings drive had  
 to phone the farmer who dealt with the
 escaped animals.                      
   On Ash grove next door to us there  
 was a swarm of bees living in a tree. 
   A bee keeper from St Johns close    
 took the bees away.                   
   When I took my dog for a walk I saw 
 the bees .I ran back home.Every one   
 had to keep their windows closed so   
 that the bees could not get in.       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
