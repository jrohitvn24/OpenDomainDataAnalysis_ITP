		<content>    In the garage lots of things are   
 kept; wood, the car, the freezer and  
 lots more. Most of it is my dad's. I  
 have only got my bike and a few things
 in the car and my bucket and spade.   
    {Shopping} is easy. My mum works in
{Leamington}so she can shop in places  
 in and around Leamington. There is a {
{Post Office} near our village and it  
 sells lots of things.                 
     I go to{Brownies}on Monday night  
 in {Cubbington}. Me and my sister Amy 
 sometimes have friends to come and    
 play with us.When it is their         
 birthday,we are sometimes invited to  
 their parties. Me and my sister and   
 mum and dad just run a normal life    
 really.
