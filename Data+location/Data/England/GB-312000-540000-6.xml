           St. Kentigerns Church.      
 Today we went to our church it is     
 called St Kentigerns and was built in 
 1848.To replace an earlier one.       
 We had a look around the inside of the
 church, there was the font, the bell  
 ringing room, the viking grave stone  
 there were plaques on the             
 walls.There was an altar, a brass     
 eagle lectern to hold the Bible there 
 was the organ and a pulpit.           
   We went to the tower in groups of   
 six. I was in the first group to go   
 up. The vicar took us up. There was   
 me, Julie, Janette, Penny, Helen and  
 Caroline. There are about 91 steps.   
 The steps were wide but the staircase 
 was very narrow. We stopped at the    
 clock work part.The pendulum was      
 massive.
