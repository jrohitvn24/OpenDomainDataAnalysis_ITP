 A building of interest in Sullington  
 is The Abbey, which was originally a  
 large mansion, the central part of    
 which was restored for use as a       
 Rectory in 1621.  The carved front    
 door has a panel bearing the date     
 1623. The house later passed into     
 private hands, and in 1953 became a   
 school run by the Dominican sisters.  
 The Smugglers' Hut was restored some  
 years ago, but still retains the      
 original chimney and old beams.  There
 is a large passage under the house,   
 giving rise to speculation that it was
 once a depot for goods smuggled       
 across the Downs from the coast.
