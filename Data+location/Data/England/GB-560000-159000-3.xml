 In the Wrotham area there is only one 
 community policeman. Although he is   
 based in Borough Green, his work takes
 him to Wrotham, Stansted and Fairseat.
 P.C. Saunders has worked as a         
 community policeman for two and a half
 months. To cover such a large area of 
 land he has a police car .50% of the  
 criminals arrested are between the    
 ages of sixteen and twenty-one.The    
 most popular crimes in Wrotham are car
 theft and vandalism.In the two and a  
 half months that he has been a        
 community policeman there has been six
 incidents of car theft in the area he 
 works.There is a growing problem with 
 glue sniffing and drugs just like any 
 other area.Although the crime rate is 
 slowly rising in Wrotham it is still a
 fairly quiet area if you compare it   
 with other towns.                     </content>
