 Headland is the {Parish Church}of     
 Scarborough.{St.Andrew's Church}is on 
 Ramshill.{Queen Street Methodist      
{Central Hall}is on Queen Street.{     
{St.Martin's Church}doesn't just have  
 services because they have different  
 groups in the Church. They have a     
 painting club which make paintings to 
 sell. They put them up so everybody   
 can see them. Another group is the    
 Ladies Working Party who have recently
 made some new kneelers. The church is 
 quite famous for its stained glass    
 windows. They have a little book stall
