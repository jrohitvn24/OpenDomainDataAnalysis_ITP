		<content> Around Painswick and Gloucester there 
 was the Civil War between the         
 Cavaliers and the Roundheads.It was   
 said that King Charles stayed at the  
 Court House.There are also bullet     
 holes in the front door.The Cavaliers 
 attacked the Roundheads in the church 
 and you can find more bullet holes in 
 the walls and fire-damaged tombs.     
 Bellringers had a lucky escape when   
 the spire of the church was struck by 
 lightning in 1883 and crashed down.   
 These bells are famous among ringers. 
 The Clipping Service on Feast Sunday  
 in mid-September has nothing to do    
 with the yew trees."Clipping" means   
 "Embracing".The children dance round  
 the church and eat "Puppy-dog Pie".   
 Robert Raikes the founder of Sunday   
 Schools,said "The feast would have    
 disgraced a heathen"                  
                                       </content>
