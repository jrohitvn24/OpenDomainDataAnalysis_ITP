		<title>15Dunmow Flitch Ceremony</title>
		<content>   The Dunmow Flitch Trials date from  
 at least 1104 when Lady Juga Baynard  
 founded the Little Dunmow Priory - the
 church was anxious to reward couples  
 who had lived together in happiness   
 for at least a year and a day. Couples
 swear in a mock court presided over by
 a judge and jury and the winning      
 couple is presented with a flitch of  
 bacon as a symbol of good luck.  The  
 couple are then paraded               
 through the streets in a special      
 chair.                                
                                       
   As from 1855 the custom was moved to
 the nearby town of Great Dunmow where 
 the trials now take place every four  
 years, but the chair is still kept in 
 the Priory.                           
                                       
   This custom is unique to England.
