 Centre built in the 1960s.{Crime}is   
 not increasing much here and is       
 average for the country.{Watford}is   
 busier.We have{125 police}and{8 police
{cars.}Our market encourages{pick-     
{pockets.}There are{3 Magistrates      
{courts}and{4 Crown courts.}Some long  
 and complex trials go to London,but   
 cases of{murder}are tried here.Herts  
 has quite a few cases of arson of all 
 kinds.The{trial}of{"The Fox" }was the 
 most important recent trial held here.
 all the{juries}come from Herts.{High

 central and has always had a court.A
