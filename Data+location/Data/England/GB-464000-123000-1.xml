		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO THE AREA</title>
		<content>   Our area, once a settlement of the  
 Jutish Tribe, Meonwara, has the River 
 Meon flowing through Westbury to West 
 Meon village where it begins its      
 southward course.                     
   Westbury, in the Domesday book a    
 manor valued at "three hides", was    
 the venue for a treaty between Henry I
 and Robert, Duke of Normandy. The     
 present house was a refuge for City of
 London records in World War Two, a    
 prep. school and a nursing home.      
   West Meon was once the home of      
 Thomas Lord, of M.C.C.fame, Richard   
 Cobden, apostle of Free Trade, Thorold
 Rogers, authoritative writer on       
 agricultural economy, and Guy Burgess,
 Twentieth century spy and defector.   
   In 1985 it is described by estate   
 agents as a much favoured area with   
 attractive coutryside, rural aspects  
 and varied housing.                   </content>
