 Secluded by-ways lead to the mainly   
 brick built villages of Illston-on-   
 the-Hill and Carlton Curlieu,which    
 lie in undulating open countryside    
 comprising some of the richest grazing
 land in England.                      
 The lanes and fields are boarded by   
 mixed hedgerows of hawthorne, black-  
 thorne, elder, sycamore and ash and   
 form the habitat for a variety of     
 wildlife.  An abundance of majestic   
 trees such as oak, beech,             
 horsechestnut, although sadly the elm 
 is no longer to be found, give an     
 impression of parkland.               
 The Gartree Road, which is an old     
 Roman Road, diagonally bisects the    
 area.  The population is unlikely to  
 increase in future years as the       
 villages are "closed" to further      
 housing developments.                 </content>
