		<title>06HOME LIFE IN M.W./SHIPT.</title>
		<content>      Home life is still important and 
 is mainly well-integrated, 4 being the
 size of average family.  Possibly the 
 most important influences are radio   
 and television, their catchphrases and
 ideas speedily assimilated into       
 everyday life.  Fitness and healthy   
 catering are gaining in importance;   
 and health foods are more popular.    
 Where mother goes out to work,        
 children have a main meal at school.  
 Household appliances have reduced     
 housecleaning time and meal           
 preparation - frozen and convenience  
 foods being widely used. There is     
 considerable DIY activity and care for
 gardens. Families  partake of         
 indoor/outdoor sports and life is very
 full of activity.  Houses are mainly  
 centrally heated, double-glazed and   
 supplied by both electricity and gas.
