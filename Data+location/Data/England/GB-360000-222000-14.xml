		<content> Conifers reach maturity in fifty to   
 sixty years; deciduous in eighty to   
 one hundred and twenty years. There   
 are four main zones under our wood-   
 land research: CHASE HOTEL: all the   
 trees in the grounds fall under a     
 Preservation Order. We counted approx 
 235 trees in the grounds. CHASE WOODS 
 east of the forest are mainly conifer 
 those to the west are mostly decid-   
 uous e.g. oak and ash. Some parts of  
 the forest have trees lettered in     
 white paint, indicating those to be   
 felled next. In the deeper forest the 
 bottom branches are in the majority   
 dead due to shortage of light to the  
 roots. Evidence of stoats in the      
 forest. Run by the Forestry Commission
 with a full-time ranger.
