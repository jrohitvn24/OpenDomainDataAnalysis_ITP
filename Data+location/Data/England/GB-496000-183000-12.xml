		<content> We discovered some beautiful buildings
 in the area. They had been country    
 homes of wealthy families 100 years   
 ago. Peole no longer can afford to    
 live in such vast houses. Heating them
 would be very expensive. One of the   
 houses at{Fulmer}has been converted   
 into luxury flats. The others have    
 been beautifully restored by companies
 searching for{Group Head Quarters}away
 from London. With the large finance   
 available the houses reflect their    
 formal glory.{Stoke Court}was a       
 virtual ruin until Miles bought it.   
 They restored it then it was destroyed
 by fire. The original facade and      
 internal rooms have been reproduced.  
{Sefton Park},in parts Elizabethan,has 
 the most impressive entrance. Strange 
 homes for industry connected with     
 High-Tec.
