		<title>04The Lavenham Walk</title>
		<content>In Lavenham we have a country          
walk,which starts at the bottom of     
High Street on the road leading to     
Bury St Edmunds.There are posts along  
the walk giving information and        
examples of the wild-life which may be 
seen.The walk was once an old railway  
line which linked Lavenham with Long   
Melford and is flanked by many trees   
and bushes.On the walk you will see    
farm animals,wild creatures and birds, 
as well as wild roses,hawthorn,        
sycamore and beech trees and some wild 
flowers. There are also several bird   
boxes and a bird table.The walk cuts   
across roads and fields and passes     
under bridges.Some village children use
the walk with their friends as a       
playground,while adults use the walk   
to exercise their dogs.
