 Many still work on local farms and    
 school leavers manage to get jobs on  
 them, but there is some youth         
 unemployment.                         
 Adult unemployment is not a serious   
 problem and a number of people are    
 self-employed. These include a wide   
 range of occupations from stone-mason,
 accountant, solicitor, estate agent,  
 publican, garage prop., plumbers, etc.
 Most women look after their homes     
 although some have part-time          
 employment locally. To summarise there
 is work in Kilmersdon but increasingly
 as new people move into the           
 surrounding areas more commute to Bath
 and Bristol.                          
 A considerable amount of voluntary    
 work is carried out by the community.
