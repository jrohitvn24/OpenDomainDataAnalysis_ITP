		<title>18A Day In My Life</title>
		<content> My name is Helen Huddart. I am ten    
 years old. I live with my parents and 
 two sisters Claire 13 and Alison 4 in 
 Boothstown.                           
 My mum woke me at 7.30am and I had    
 breakfast at 8 o'clock. On the way to 
 school I stopped at the sweet shop    
 with my friends. School started at    
 8.55am and after assembly I went to my
 maths group. After I had finished my  
 maths I tried out a new computer      
 program called 'Surburban Fox'. At    
 playtime I practised dancing in the   
 yard with my friends. After play I    
 drew a picture of our trip to the     
 Mines Rescue Station. At lunchtime I  
 ate some ham sandwiches and a piece of
 cake. Afterwards I just sat outside on
 the grass.                            
 At 1 o'clock I went back into school  
 and soon it was time for the baths. We
 went by bus to Eccles Pool.           </content>
