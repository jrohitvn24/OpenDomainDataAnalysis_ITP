		<title>12East Brent Harvest Home</title>
		<content> Every year at the end of August the   
  Harest Home is held in the village.  
 It is an  important event which first 
 started in 1857.It was suggested by a 
 church warden John Higgs to the vicar 
 of that time, Arch Deacon Dennison.   
 It was held to thank God for the      
 harvest and for his goodness.It was   
 also a holiday for the farm workers   
  and was probably the only day off    
 they had in the year.The first Harvest
 Home was held in the grounds of the   
 vicarage - now Rossholme School,      
 using a large marquee. The Harvest    
 Home held every year until 1914, it   
 stopped then because of the war and   
 did not start again until 1957.
