		<title>07Housing in Pitsea and Vange.</title>
		<content> Pitsea was a village area surrounded  
 by farmland.Now Pitsea has become part
 of Basildon new town.Vange which is   
 also covered by our grid reference,   
 was also a small village now          
 incorporated into Basildon new town.  
 Much of the housing is Basildon       
 council or Basildon corporation       
 property.                             
 Most of this property are terraced    
 houses. There are also some flats and 
 these are mainly 3 storeys. There are 
 some sheltered housing schemes for old
 people with a warden to look after    
 them.                                 
 There is also some private housing in 
 the area and most of these houses are 
 detached.

 School.
