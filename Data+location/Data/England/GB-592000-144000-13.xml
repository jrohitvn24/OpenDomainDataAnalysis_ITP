		<content>{THE WHITE LADY OF SURRENDEN MANOR}was 
 in life the wife of a Lord Dering.    
 Tragically she died at an early age,  
 so great was her beauty that her      
 grieving husband, was un able to bear 
 the thought of her rotting in her     
 grave, had her body embalmed and put  
 in the family vault. The crypt was    
 destroyed by fire in 1952 and that was
 when her ghost arose.                 
{THE WHITE LADY OF ST. NICHOLAS CHURCH}
 was also the wife of a Lord Dering    
 some 500 years ago. She too was a lady
 of exquisite beauty and her husband   
 had her body preserved in a series of 
 lead coffins placed inside an oaken   
 cask. Her ghost wanders close to the  
 vault in which she was placed.
