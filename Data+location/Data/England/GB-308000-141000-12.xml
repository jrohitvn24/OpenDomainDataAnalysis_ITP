 parts of {West Somerset.}             
      There is an old man called Billy 
 and he has been in Williton Hospital  
 eversince he was a boy.But before the 
 Hospital was built he was in the      
{workhouse.}                           
     The Hospital was a{Victorian      
{Workhouse}and  is A listed building so
 it cant be pulled down. this makes    
 modern nursing very difficult.The     
 workhouse was built in 1838 and was   
 taken over by the{National Health}in  
 1948 after the war.
