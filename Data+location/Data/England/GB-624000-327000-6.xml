		<title>06TRANSPORT IN FELMINGHAM</title>
		<content> Public Transport is poor in this      
 region. The National Bus Service sends
 out one bus a week, on a Saturday     
 morning.                              
 In Felmingham we have a{Community Bus}
 which runs two mornings a week into   
 North Walsham, and, if you are fairly 
 agile you can make the connection with
 the train to Norwich. There is no bus 
 service to Aylsham.                   
 The local schools are served by       
 special buses. Technically only       
 children between 5 &amp; 8 are entitled to
 travel to Colby Primary School; but in
 practise, as there are spare seats,   
 the older children are allowed on.    
 Those over 11 years travel free of    
 charge to Aylsham Secondary School or 
 Paston 6th Form College in North      
 Walsham.
