		<title>05WORKING POPULATION FULFORD</title>
		<content>Fulford Primary School  made a         
population study by adding up the      
number of voters,the children in the   
school,their brothers and sisters .They
found that in the parish of Fulford    
there were a number of different types 
of occupations present:-               
agricultural workers                   
basic services-gas,electricity,water.  
manufacturing-mainly pottery.          
construction industry-house building.  
distribution and catering.             
Of the 2,430 employed population most  
work in jobs connected with the pottery
industry of Stoke-on-Trent which is the
nearest urban area 10 Km. to the N.W.  
However the area appears very "rural"  
in outlook even though only 40         
residents are directly involved in     
agriculture.                           
Fulford is a typical dormitory village.
