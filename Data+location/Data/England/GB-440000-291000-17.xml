		<content>{GAS LEAK                              
  One of the main items in the news    
 recently was the gas leak at Hinckley 
 Leisure Centre in September 1984. It  
 was caused as new chemicals were being
 delivered.The driver connected the    
 wrong chemical to the wrong tank.     
 Chlorine gas was produced and gas     
 found its way to the swimmming pools. 
 Thirty of the children who were having
 a swimming lesson and the manager Mr. 
 Collins were taken to Nuneaton        
 Hospital in a fleet of ambulances.    
  No-one was seriously hurt. Since the 
 gas leak further precautions have been
 taken to ensure that it cannot happen 
 again.
