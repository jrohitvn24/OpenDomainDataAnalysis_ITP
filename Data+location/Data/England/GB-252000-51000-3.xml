		<title>03Public Houses of Elburton</title>
		<content> Mr. Strawbridge is the manager of the 
 "Ships Tavern and Kings Head". It is  
 positioned very near the main shopping
 area of Elburton village. It was built
 in the 17th century and was first used
 as a cider house with apple orchards  
 around it. It is split into two pubs  
 but is under the same management. The 
 Kings Head is the old part of the pub.
 The Ships Tavern is the restaurant.   
                                       
 Mr.Edwards is the manager of "The     
 Elburton". It is 80_90 years old. It  
 is positioned along the A379 on a busy
 crossroads. On the windows it says    
 "Elburton Hotel" but it is not a hotel
 so Mr.Edwards would like to change    
 them, but he is not allowed to        
 because of their value.
