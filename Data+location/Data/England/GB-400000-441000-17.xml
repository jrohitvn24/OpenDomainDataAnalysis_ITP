		<content>   In 1982 the engine arrived from     
 British Rail,Doncaster,causing great  
 excitment.Problems were caused by the 
 steep gradient of the road which is   
 1 in 5 to 1 in 7.Whitley Head is about
 600feet above sea level.The road had  
 to be closed while a specially hired  
 crane attempted to place the engine in
 Mr.Kevin Cox's back garden.Specially  
 strengthened planks were used whilst  
 the engine weighing several tonnes was
 being manoeuvered into place.         
   The event attracted a lot of        
 attention from newspapers and regional
 television.                           
   The engine has now been renovated   
 and painted and Mr.Cox's children use 
 it to play in,while Mr.Cox tries to   
 keep it in good condition.
