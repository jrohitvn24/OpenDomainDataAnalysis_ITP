		<title>15The Pentewan road</title>
		<content> On the way to Pentewan beach there is 
 a very bendy road but very long.On the
 way there are a few houses and lots of
 trees all diferent colours and sizes. 
 The types of trees that are along the 
 road are: oak trees,fir trees and all 
 kinds of others.                      
   There are four holiday camps        
 (including Pentewan holiday camp)     
 along the road.Also along the road    
 there is a sign that leads to Polgooth
 and on the other side there is a      
 public house and three houses and when
 I go past them there are three cars   
 because of the houses.                
   On the way to Pentewan we have to go
 through a very dark spot where the    
 trees are arched over the road and we 
 pass near London Apprentice.          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
