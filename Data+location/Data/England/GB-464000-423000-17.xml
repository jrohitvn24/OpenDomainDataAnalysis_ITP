		<content> Carlton Towers Estate consists of more
 than 2OOO acres, 2 of which are       
 ornamental gardens. One full time     
 gardener caters for the gardens. 4OOO 
 roses,2OOO bedding plants and         
 rhododendrons are part of the         
 greenery. lOOO trees of both soft and 
 hardwood have been planted this year. 
 Farmland is used for dairy farming    
 and to grow wheat and sugar beet. The 
 remainder of the ground is parkland   
 used for camping and other social     
 events. The flower beds in the        
 ornamental gardens are in shapes of   
 x's, y's and d's and,according to the 
 gardener,they have been there since   
 the turn of the century. Nearby stands
 a decaying pavillion from where the   
 tennis was viewed.  Trees are now     
 growing in place of the tennis court.
