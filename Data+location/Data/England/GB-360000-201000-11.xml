		<title>11Cycle Training</title>
		<content>    Cycle Proficiency Training has     
 become an annual event for the Fourth 
 Year pupils of Severnbanks School.    
 Once carried out by the police, the   
 lessons are now given by senior pupils
 and their teacher from nearby         
 Whitecross Comprehensive School.      
    The course begins with the cycles  
 being checked for roadworthiness. This
 includes brakes, tyres, chain and     
 saddle height. Next comes riding      
 skills such as riding in and out lines
 of cones and emergency stops. Signals 
 to other road users is the next       
 important habit to be practised.      
    After several lessons comes a mock 
 test followed by the real one. This   
 includes a written test on the Highway
 Code which we have to learn at home.  
 Finally if we have been successful    
 comes the award of the Cycling        
 Proficiency Certificate and badges.   </content>
