		<content>      There are excellent facilities   
 for both the resident and holiday     
 maker. A large golf course near Fort  
 Gilkicker has marvellous views across 
 the Solent. Along the coast there is  
 a Sailing and Angling Club, as well as
 facilities for the keen jogger,walkers
 and brave swimmers.                   
      Over the water on Southsea Common
 the tourist is well catered for, with 
 a large Amusement Arcade which would  
 delight both adult and child! It is a 
 very popular attraction in the summer 
 season and the snack bars and         
 ice-cream kiosks do a marvellous      
 trade. It is accessible by public     
 transport  and there are also car     
 parking facilities along the Common at
 Southsea.                             
      Several large hotels on the edge 
 ofthe Common cater for summer         
 visitors.                             </content>
