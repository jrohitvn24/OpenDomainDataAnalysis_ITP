		<content>    Today we went to a church in       
 Bures.The mount was quite near to the 
 church and it was near to the road.   
 It had a very good view over the land.
 On the top of it there used to be a   
 wooden fort but that got destroyed and
 there was nothing there now.          
    The mount would have been hard to  
 attack because they would have had to 
 climb it to fight.Now it is covered   
 with trees,flowers and stinging       
 nettles.                              
    There is a legend that Queen       
 Boadicea is buried under the mound.   
    A lady came and showed us some     
 slides of the area.They were aerial   
 views of fields that have got big     
 rings showing in them at the right    
 time of year.The rings show where     
 chieftains were buried under big      
 mounds of earth with ditches round    
 them.                                 </content>
