		<title>05THE FELON SOW</title>
		<content> Ralph Rokeby, who lived at Rokeby in  
 Tudor times, had a formidable sow.    
 From her lair in Mortham Woods she    
 terrorised the neighbourhood so she   
 was given to the  Friars of Richmond  
 for their larder, provided they caught
 her.  Friar Middleton and two friends,
 armed for a dangerous expedition, set 
 out to accomplish the capture.  Their 
 quarry was located, and after a long  
 struggle roped by Peter Dale, whereon 
 it charged him, squealing so fiercely 
 the Friar thought it possessed by an  
 evil spirit and began to exorcise it. 
 Friar's Latin was more than the sow   
 could stand so she turned her attack  
 on him, forcing him to shin up the    
 nearest tree.  At evening Friar and   
 friends returned empty handed to      
 Richmond. Next day another party of   
 hungry Friars set out and after an    
 epic struggle overcame the sow.       </content>
