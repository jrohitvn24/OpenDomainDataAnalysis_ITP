		<content>   Mr. Randall, the owner of Hyde and  
 Temple Farms, normally spends between 
 Â£70,000 and Â£200,000 on equipment to  
 help him run his farms efficiently.   
 Here is some information about a few  
 of his farm machines.                 
   He has a new tractor with an air-   
 conditioned cab, which cost around    
 Â£25,000. Tractors are very useful     
 because of the different attachments  
 which can be put on them to do various
 tasks such as ploughing and sowing    
 seed. A crop sprayer is used for inse-
 cticides and fertilisers, as well as  
 watering the crops in dry weather. Mr.
 Randall's sprayer holds 2400 litres.  
   Combine harvesters cost about       
 Â£40,000, and pasture mowers Â£2,000.   
 Mr.Randall also has machines to churn 
 the hay and mix the silage for the    
 cows, and to distribute feed to them  
 in the cow shed pens.                 </content>
