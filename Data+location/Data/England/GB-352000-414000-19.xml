		<content>"Tiggy on High"                        
The last one off the ground is "ON" -  
the others then take a chance to run to
another "safe" place,the plerson who is
ON then tries to "tig" another child.  
When they touch someone they say "tug  
you're on".                            
"Seashells"                            
This game is played with a ball.The    
person who is on turns away from the   
others and throws the ball over their  
shoulder.When someone has the ball all 
the children put hands behind them and 
shout "SEASHELLS".The person who is ON 
turns round and guesses who is hiding  
the ball.If the guess is right the     
person with the ball is now ON.        
"TWO BALL OUT"                         
About six people stand in a circle two 
balls are passed around.The person who 
gets stuck with TWO BALLS is OUT.
