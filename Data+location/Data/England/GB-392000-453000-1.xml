		<content> In the valley of the{River Aire}which 
 flows through the village from West to
 East, with{Sharphaw}1171 ft. to the NE
 and{Scaleber}550 ft. to the SW, {     
{Gargrave}is between 350 and 400 ft.   
 above sea level.                      
 On the Southern edge of the{Yorkshire 
{Dales National Park,}Gargrave is not a
 typical Dales village, but an         
 attractive village which would be at  
 home in almost any county.            
 The three{village greens}are not      
 common land, but belong to the        
 village, giving residents fishing     
 rights from them                      
 There has been a settlement of some   
 kind here from very early times. The  
 remains of a{Roman Villa}lie buried at
{Kirk Sink}to the SE of the village.
