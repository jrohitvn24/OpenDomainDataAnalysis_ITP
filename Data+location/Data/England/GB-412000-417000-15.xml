		<title>15HOUSES IN FIXBY / SHEEPRIDGE</title>
		<content> The houses in Fixby are old.  Some of 
 them have lawns in the front.  Fixby  
 houses are much better than the ones  
 in Sheepridge.  We walked all the way 
 to count the houses and look at the   
 street life.  The houses are much     
 different than ours.  Some of them are
 1, 2, 3 storey houses.  Most of them  
 are old detached and old              
 semi-detached, new detached and new   
 semi-detached.  Our's are just normal.
 The houses are much more cared for.   
 Not like ours.  Ours are vandalised.  
                                       
 When we were walking down Lightridge  
 Road we saw a house that had flower   
 boxes outside the windows.  Seven of  
 the houses had special names.  Five of
 the houses were for sale (between     
 Â£56,OOO AND Â£7O,OOO).
