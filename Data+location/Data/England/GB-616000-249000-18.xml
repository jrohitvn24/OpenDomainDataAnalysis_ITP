		<title>18COCKFIELD HALL</title>
		<content> Originally two cottages- the owners   
think the name came from the corncockle
plant which grew in the corn fields    
years ago. Used to be Cocklefield Hall.
The farmhouse was destroyed by fire in 
the 1920's; the farmer put brushwood   
round the house and set alight to it.  
The house was then renovated and       
rebuilt. Owned by a Mrs Patten in      
1930's &amp; she had students living there 
in specially built quarters.           
 The building was always connected with
farming &amp; now has 150 acres including  
Wells Farm land. Mixed farm originally 
with a few animals, present owners not 
farmers.                               
 980's- Fields now bigger some hedges  
have gone and new buildings            
constructed.
