		<title>10FARMING-A FARM VISIT</title>
		<content>    The farm we visited is typical of  
 many farms in this area,but gradually 
 these small farms are being taken over
 by large companies.                   
    The farm covers 80 acres and is    
 not an arable farm,only grass is grown
 for animal feed.The fields are divided
 up by hedgerows, whereas many farmers 
 these days root out hedges form more  
 efficiency, sadly changing the ecology
{MACHINERY}                            
    Mr Chapman has 2 tractors which use
 250 gallons of diesel fuel annually.  
 Among his machinery he has a hay      
 tedder,trailer, dung spreader, roller 
 and harrows.He like some modern       
 methods but detests factory           
 farming.He works the farm  on his     
 own,only employing help at haymaking  
 time
