		<content>{Little Parndon Mill}                  
 This fine building was taken over as a
 craft centre some fifteen years ago   
 and now gives accommodation to a      
 blacksmith, a painter, a picture      
 framer, two potters and a sculptor.   
 We visited the foundry and talked to  
 Clive Hick and Chas who use aluminium 
 and bronze for their castings of model
 cars, badges, go-cart mountings, sword
 handles and computer components.      
                                       
 Parndon Mill's most celebrated        
 occupant is its present owner, Sally  
 Anderson, who has worked here since   
 she set up as a designer in ceramics  
 and tiles fifteen years ago. She      
 claims to be self-sufficient in food, 
 growing vegetables and keeping sheep, 
 rabbits and a goat.
