		<content>  Cheap Street, the main street, caters
 for both locals and tourists.         
  A typical gallery stocks about 40    
 prints and water colours ranging in   
 price from Â£895 to Â£4. They buy and   
 sell second hand paintings at reason_ 
 able prices. How do they know the     
 paintings and maps are genuine? Its   
 quite easy to find out by the quality 
 of the paper _ they have never had a  
 fake in the gallery yet which is good.
  The largest department store sells   
 clothes for all ages in a range of    
 prices and styles.                    
   Jeans  Â£17 - Â£25    Shirts  Â£9 - Â£12
   Dress  Â£14 - Â£200   Jumpers Â£15- Â£40
   Shoes  Â£10 - Â£35                    
  The back of the building was burnt   
 down in 1980 but was quickly rebuilt. 
  Easy road access to Yeovil enables   
 shoppers to use a large shopping      
 centre if they choose to.             </content>
