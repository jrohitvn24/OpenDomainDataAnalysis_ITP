		<title>09COMPUTING IN KENDAL</title>
		<content>  The age of computing at the moment in
 Kendal does not affect people already 
 in a job by making them unemployed but
 fewer people are being taken on as the
 use of computers expands. The town,   
 having diverse occupations, has not   
 had the large scale redundancies      
 affecting larger cities.              
  40% of pupils in Kirkbie Kendal      
 School own a computer. The school uses
 BBC model Bs and Electrons.           
  The best selling home computers in   
 Kendal are Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum  
 and Electrons. They are mostly used in
 Kendal for games by children and for  
 small businesses. The biggest selling 
 game at the moment is Elite for all   
 three computers. In Kendal there are  
 three computer shops, Ace Computers,  
 Kendal Computer Centre and WH Smith's 
 computer department.
