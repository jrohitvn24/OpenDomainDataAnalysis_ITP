		<content> A HYPERMARKET IS A CAREFULLY PLANNED  
 OUT_OF_TOWN SHOPPING CENTRE IN WHICH A
 WIDE RANGE OF GOODS AND SERVICES ARE  
 AVAILABLE IN A SINGLE COMPLEX.        
 HYPERMARKETS ASSUME A MOBILE AND      
 AFFLUENT POPULATION WITH A HIGH LEVEL 
 OF CAR OWNERSHIP. HYPERMARKETS SEEK TO
 CHANGE TRADITIONAL SHOPPING PATTERNS  
 BY ATTRACTING CUSTOMERS WHO WILL MAKE 
 A RELATIVELY INFREQUENT VISIT TO      
 PURCHASE IN BULK ITEMS WHICH ARE      
 NORMALLY BOUGHT LOCALLY ON A MORE     
 FREQUENT BASIS. ADVANTAGES OF THE     
 HYPERMARKETS ARE THAT THEY RELIEVE    
 CONGESTION IN CROWDED SUBURBAN        
 DISTRICTS AND SHOPPING IS MADE MORE   
 PLEASANT AND EASY WHERE ALL SERVICES  
 ARE LOCATED AT A SINGLE CENTRE WITH   
 ADJACENT CAR PARKING FACILITIES. EVEN 
 SO THERE ARE HIGH TRANSPORT COSTS     
 INVOLVED AND THE CENTRES CONSUME      
 EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS OF LAND.(SLIDE C)   </content>
