		<title>02WOBURN ABBEY :1</title>
		<content> Woburn Abbey is the family home of the
 Russells. The abbey part of the name  
 derives from the Cistercian Abbey     
 founded in the 12th century.          
                                       
 Like so many other monastic buildings,
 it and its land was taken into the    
 ownership of the Crown at the         
 Dissolution. In 1547, it was given to 
 the 1st Earl of Bedford by King Edward
 VI and has remained in the family ever
 since. The building was completely    
 remodelled in 1747 and again altered  
 and extended in 1802. It suffered, as 
 did so many other similar buildings   
 during the early years of the present 
 century from increasing running costs 
 and a large section has been          
 demolished.
