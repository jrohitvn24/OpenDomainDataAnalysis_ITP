		<content> form a feature of the new extension   
 which is used as a restaurant. The    
 garden at the back of the pub has been
 extended and improved and there is an 
 ample car park.                       
 The house next to " The Lynmore", was 
 once a chapel which was converted into
 a pottery and is now a private        
 dwelling, called "The Chapel". The    
 large bungalow next to this has been  
 fitted with solar panels in the       
 roof and these are clearly visible    
 from the top of the Clappers.
