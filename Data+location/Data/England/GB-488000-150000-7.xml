		<title>07Old Buildings in Ash.</title>
		<content>   Ash has many fine old buildings.    
 When the original Domesday Book survey
 was undertaken the village had 18     
 inhabitants. It has now increased by  
 about a thousand-fold.                
   Ash Manor and St Peter's Church are 
 mentioned in the original Domesday    
 Book and have separate pages devoted  
 to them.                              
   Other buildings of historic interest
 are 'Hartshorn' next to the church    
 built around 1350, 'Azor Place'       
 (formerly 'Bricklyn') and 'Merryworth'
 both dating to Elizabethan times.     
   Many of the local inns are also very
 old. 'The Nightingale' and 'The       
 Cannon' are both 400 years old and    
 'The Greyhound' is 300 years old.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
