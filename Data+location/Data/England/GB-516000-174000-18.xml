		<content> In 1728 a house in Kew was rented to  
 Frederick, Prince of Wales, whose wife
 Princess Augusta decided to replan the
 gardens and remodel the house. She    
 enlarged the gardens and comissioned  
 William Chambers to design a {Pagoda} 
 and an{Orangery}to ornament them.{Kew}
{Palace }was later incorporated into   
 the grounds.The foundation date of the
 gardens is accepted as 1759, since    
 then plants have been collected from  
 all over the world and 14 houses such 
 as the{Palm House}and{Temperate House 
 have been built to accomodate them.   
 Other attractions at Kew are the      
{Waterlily House}where the giant       
 waterlily Victoria Amazonica can be   
 seen, the{flagpole}made from Douglas  
 Fir is over 33 metres high, the{wood} 
{museum,}the vast new {Alpine House   }
 which should be completed this        
 year and many others.                 </content>
