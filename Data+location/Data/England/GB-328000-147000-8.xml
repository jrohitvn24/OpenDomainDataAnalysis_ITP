  There have been carnivals in Somerset
 for over 300 years. They were held    
 originally to celebrate the attempt by
 Guy Fawkes to blow up the Houses of   
 Parliament.                           
                                       
  Approximately 100 floats enter the   
 competition which is held in November 
 each year, some are musical and full  
 of movement and some are tableaux,    
 some are made by and for children, and
 there are majorettes and characters   
 who simply walk along in costume.     
 Everything is very brightly lit, and  
 there is a wonderful excitement in the
 air at Carnival time.                 
                                       
  There are several categories which   
 are judged, and prizes are awarded for
 originality, overall appearance,      
 costume and lighting.                 </content>
