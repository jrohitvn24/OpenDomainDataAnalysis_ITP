		<title>12  THE OLD RECTORY.</title>
		<content> The rectory is a good example of 18th.
century housing.Construction began in  
1790 but was not completed until 1820. 
        Originally it was part of the  
Earl of Shrewsbury's estate.It ceased  
to be used as a rectory in 1937 and    
during the Second World War was used by
the army.For the last eight years it   
has been owned by Mr.J,Howells who,    
prior to this had rented a flat in the 
rectory for twenty seven years.He now  
looks after the six acres of land that 
is attached to the building.           
The rectory has now been converted into
private flats.This has partly been done
to help with the high cost of running  
the building. Unfortunately, this has  
meant that some of the interior has    
been changed and the old character has 
been lost. This does seem to be a trend
that is on the increase to examples of.
local history in this area.            </content>
