		<title>12Animals in the Hutton Area</title>
		<content> As this is an area with many unculti- 
 vated parts and mixed woodland,it is a
 good habitat for a great variety of   
 animals,birds and flowers.Badgers have
 setts in the woods.Roe deer are in    
 Douthwaitedale.Grey squirrels are     
 common in all the woods.There is an   
 abundance of rabbits,a few hares and  
 some foxes.Hedgehogs are common every 
 -where and often come into the gardens
 On summer evenings long-eared bats can
 frequently be seen flying about.Moles 
 have runs in many of the fields and   
 there are weasels, stoats,voles and   
 field mice.Water voles can sometimes  
 be seen in or near the rivers.Adders  
 and grass snakes are found on the moor
 Frogs and toads are still found in    
 various damp places,but their numbers 
 have decreased in recent years.
