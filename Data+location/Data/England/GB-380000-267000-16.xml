		<title>16The Life Of A Policeman.</title>
		<content> by Natasha Peace                      
 The policeman in Astley has lived in  
 the station for 3 years and 3 months. 
 He is the only policeman there and    
 has been in the police force for 5    
 years and 6 months.Before he moved    
 to Astley he was based in             
 Kidderminster.He works an 8 hour      
 shift for 28 days and has 8 days off  
 including 1 weekend.He covers an area 
 of 200 sq.miles.He has about 3 or 4   
 calls a day on his radio which are    
 passed through from Kidderminster and 
 Stourport stations.Because the area   
 covered is mainly rural there are     
 chiefly petty crimes,poaching         
 etc,although there are many road      
 accidents caused by narrow winding    
 roads with concealed entrances.
