		<title>08Longage Farm</title>
		<content>  Mr Ridley-Day and his wife have lived
 at the farm for fifteen years. He has 
 two daughters and the youngest one    
 goes to Sibton Park Boarding School.  
 The farm buildings are very old, some 
 barns look very modern, but the roof  
 and some of the walls have been       
 rebuilt with wood and corrugated iron.
 One barn had the end collapse and it  
 has been repaired by Mr Marsh from    
 Lyminge. One barn had a combine       
 harvester and straw in it. The house  
 is 500 years old with Kent peg tiles  
 on the roof. There is a Tudor barn,   
 and a yard for dairy cows. The farm   
 has 400 acres with 24 fields. 300     
 acres are arable and the other 150    
 acres are grass. Mr Ridley-Day        
 produces his own hay and grows some   
 cereals. The farm fields have all got 
 names like Pillrags, Millfield and    
 Blacklands.                           </content>
