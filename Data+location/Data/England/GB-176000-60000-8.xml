		<content> We asked 2 elderly residents what     
 their everyday life was like.  One is 
 an old age pensioner which means she  
 is over 60 years old and finds it     
 hard to do her house work.  The people
 from St. Johns Ambulance Brigade help 
 her in her house.  The St. Johns      
 Ambulance group are a voluntary organ-
 ization with people trained in First  
 Aid and Care.  She gets up each morn- 
 ing, has breakfast and watches "Break-
 fast Television" for 2.5 hours.  Later
 on she goes to see her friends in     
 Newquay and plays cards.  She goes to 
 town to get her shopping such as      
 biscuits, drink, cake and meat.       
 Another resident's hobby is to look   
 after his garden, when he gets time,  
 and to help other pensioners with     
 theirs.                               
                                       
                                       </content>
