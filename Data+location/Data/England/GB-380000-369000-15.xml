		<content>  Most of the entertainment which takes
 place in the area is centered on the  
{Village Hall,}which was built in 1966.
 It is run by a voluntary comittee of  
 20 local people and maintained by one 
 person who is paid from the Hall fund.
  Throughout the year there are certain
 major functions such as the{Rose     }
{Festival}which is held on the 1st     
 Saturday in July and followed by the  
 long standing{Gooseberry Show,}which  
 first took place in the previous      
 village hall in 1883, on the last     
 Saturday in July. There are smaller   
{functions}held on a regular basis     
 either weekly, such as Bingo which is 
 run alternatly by the Parish Council  
 and the Gooseberry Society in order to
 raise funds. A Dancing Class is held  
 every Monday and each month the local 
 branch of the Women's Institute meets 
 in the Hall.                          </content>
