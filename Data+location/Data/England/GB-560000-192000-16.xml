		<content>{"Hutton village School Closure"}      
  The picturesque Hutton Village School
 is to close despite an eighteen month 
 fight by parents and staff to save it 
 - there has been a school on this site
 since 1840.                           
  A statement from the action group to 
 save the school told the village      
 feeling this week (22nd May 1985)     
  " After we had lived here for        
 eighteen months with the threat of    
 closure we were never prepared for the
 sadness that we experienced when we   
 knew for certain on May 9th that      
 Hutton School would be closed" stated 
 Libby Read.
