		<content>  There are two Public Houses, The     
White Mare and The Royal Oak, as well  
as three Hotels, Yourity, Blackbeck and
Sella Park, in our area. Public Houses 
are the busiest at lunch times and     
Saturday evenings, while the Hotels are
busiest in the Summer months. Two of   
the Hotels serve restaurant meals while
the Public Houses serve bar meals.     
Tourists and business men are the main 
customers of the Hotels. The Public    
Houses are mostly frequented by the    
local inhabitants. There is a Social   
Club at Braystones which provides      
facilities for the residents and       
visitors of the Caravan Site.          
  Young people meet in each others'    
homes to listen to Â£Pop' music. Their  
favourite group is Wham closely        
followed by Duran Duran and Boy George.
