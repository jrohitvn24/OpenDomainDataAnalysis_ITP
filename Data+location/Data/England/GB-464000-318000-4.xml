 The Church at Ragdale is dedicated to 
 All Saints.  It is a pretty little    
 ironstone church, which has a small   
 stone tower with a brick top, a nave, 
 south aisle and south chapel and      
 contains a few fragments of old oak.  
 It also has a Victorian heraldic glass
 window, put in when the Church was    
 restored in 1874, which illustrates   
 the connections with the Shirley      
 family in the sixteenth century.  The 
 Font is of Norman origin.  In the     
 churchyard there is a tall stone cross
 of some antiquity.
