		<content>    The ages of the residents range    
 from 18 to 33 and bedrooms are shared.
 None of them is married, because it is
 not encouraged for the mentally       
 handicapped. Breakfast is served at   
 9am and the residents move places at  
 the table so that their memories do   
 not lock onto one routine.            
    After breakfast they usually go to 
 work at the local adult training      
 centre during the day. The evening    
 meal is eaten at 6pm and then, in the 
 evening, they can watch television or 
 play games or there might be a social 
 evening organised.                    
    Around the site the residents help 
 to build up the smallholding, where   
 they are trying to grow fruit and     
 vegetables, and also help to look     
 after their animals, such as horses   
 and ducks. Some of the residents go   
 back home for the weekends.           </content>
