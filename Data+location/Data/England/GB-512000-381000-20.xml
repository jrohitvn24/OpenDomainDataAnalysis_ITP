		<content>    There are no clubs or associations 
 in the Torringtons themselves. The    
 Methodist Chapel schoolroom is used as
 a social centre, where occasional     
 whist drives are held, or children's  
 parties when there are sufficient     
 children in the village. A group is   
 currently working to save West        
 Torrington church from redundancy, but
 much of the impetus for this has come 
 from elsewhere, West Torrington being 
 inclined to Methodism, if anything.   
    The information on this disc was   
 collected by members of{East Barkwith 
{and District Women's Institute}which  
 meets in a village adjoining East and 
 West Torrington, but which, at the    
 moment, does not include any members  
 from either of these villages.
