		<content> Local History:Prewett's Mill was built
 in 1861. It was steam powered, not    
 water. It was used for stone grinding 
 flour for human consumption. The      
 engine lasted until 1970. The         
 millstones are made of French granite 
 which had to be dressed every day. The
 mill was bought by United Rum         
 Merchants in 1980.The building was    
 redesigned by Christopher Hide. The   
 alterations took 10 months costing    
 Â£3 million. Only the outside shell    
 remains of the original building.     
 Provender Mill-built in 1861 as a one 
 storey mill. There were originaly two 
 wheels, one undershot, one overshot   
 but they rotted away. Provender comes 
 from saxon word meaning animal food.  
 Abandoned in 1960, Mr. Paul Brand     
 bought the mill in 1983 and found it  
 in a terrible state. Now restored as  
 private house with four storeys.      </content>
