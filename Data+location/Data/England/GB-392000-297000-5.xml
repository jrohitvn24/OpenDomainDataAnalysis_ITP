		<content>The leisure facilities in our area are:
the park, its facilities, the Speedway 
Stadium,the library, the Boxing Club   
and some other organised clubs. Many   
people visit East Park occasionally    
although it facilities are little used.
Few children use the Stadium. The      
library near the school is well used   
but the Boxing Club attracts a few     
enthusiasts only.                      
On Friday nights the young people can  
enjoy games such as Pool and Table     
tennis at an organised youth club.     
Refreshments are available. On Tuesdays
boys can go to the Cubs.The uniform is 
green.They do good deeds for the       
community. In summer they go to camp.  
Later they can become Scouts. On       
Mondays girls can go to the Junoes     
Church club to learn about the Bible,  
First Aid and Nature. Many children    
belong to these organisations.         </content>
