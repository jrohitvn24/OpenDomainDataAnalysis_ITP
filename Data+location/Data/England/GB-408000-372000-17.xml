{they rent 150 acres of land which     
{belongs to ICI.}Their main produce is{
 milk and they own 65 milking cows     
 which are milked twice a day in a     
 five-a-side milking parlour. Their    
 animals are kept in all the time in   
 sheds in winter.                      
    Farming is quite difficult in      
 winter because of the steep hill and  
 of the road blocks on the A6. The farm
 supplies the milk marketing board.They
 are in a farming union and have been  
 in the business all their lives. Their
 working times are{6am_11pm}and they   
 don't employ anyone.{Friends and      
{family help them.}The farm produces{  
{200 gallons of milk a day.}The        
 farmer's daughter's main hobby is     
 showing the bulls in competitions.    
 They have at least 7 buildings on the 
 farm all used for different purposes. </content>
