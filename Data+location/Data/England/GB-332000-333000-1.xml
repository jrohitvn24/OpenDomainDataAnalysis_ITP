		<title>01THE AREA IN GENERAL</title>
		<content>{The land is mainly used for farming   
{eg.dairy and beef,but}sometimes cereal
 crops are grown eg. barley(for        
 feeding to beef cattle). The holdings 
 are either{medium sized farms}(about  
 100_200 acres) or{small_holdings,     
{although some}properties are purely   
 residential, occupied by either       
 retired people or people working out  
 of the area.                          
    The roads are often very narrow    
 with high hedges on either side. The  
 roads are often muddy because they are
  used as a means of{moving cattle     
{from one field to another.}Other roads
 are very bumpy as the tarmac surface  
 has worn away.{Some of the roads are  
{just small tracks used by tractors.
