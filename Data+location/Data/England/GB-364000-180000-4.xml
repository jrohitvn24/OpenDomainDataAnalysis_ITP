		<title>04A day in the life of Amelia</title>
		<content> My name is Amelia Brunt and I am 11   
 years old. During school time I get up
 at 8.00am. My dad takes me to school  
 in his van. He drops me off on his way
 to work.                              
 School starts at 8.55am. We have      
 service at about 9.15am. We have 15   
 minutes play at 10.30. After dinner on
 Mondays we go swimming and on Friday  
 afternoons we have sewing. I have made
 a blouse during sewing lessons. We    
 have games on Tuesdays and P.E. on    
 Friday afternoons.                    
 The lessons we have are English,      
 History, Maths, Sience,Geography,     
 Computer Work, Handwriting and Art. We
 have the chance to learn the guitar,  
 violin and recorder. We go home at    
 3.45pm. When I get home I watch T.V or
 do some cooking. After my tea I help  
 my mum do the dishes. I go to bed at  
 9.30pm.                               </content>
