		<title>08SCHOOL HOBBIES</title>
		<content>    Most of the children in Dorothy    
 Barley Junior School have hobbies. We 
 did a survey: our hobbies include     
 majorettes, youth clubs, football,    
 swimming, karate and judo clubs and   
 Brownies. The most favourite hobby is 
 swimming; the second favourite is     
 going to Brownies. The least favourite
 is the youth club.

 My troop is called the 21st Barking   
 Bellahoy St. Cedds. I go on Friday. I 
 have to pass my bronze, silver and    
 gold arrows. I have learned how to do 
 a reef knot and a round turn two and a
 half hitches. We also play games, but 
 my most favourite thing of all is when
 we go to camp. We live in tents and   
 have to cook our own food - which     
 means {BEANS}nearly every day!!!
