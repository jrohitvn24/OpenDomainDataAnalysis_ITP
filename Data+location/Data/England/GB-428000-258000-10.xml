		<content>{SPRING}                               
  In spring a lot of the farmers time  
 is taken up with lambing in one of the
 large lambing sheds. He is also       
 putting fertilizer on both arable and 
 pasture land and planting some of the 
 corn crops. The cattle and sheep are  
 put out as the grass begins to grow   
 and the crops already growing are     
 sprayed to control weeds and diseases.
{SUMMER}                               
  In summer the farmer mows some of the
 pasture land to make silage, whilst in
 good weather he also makes hay for    
 animal feed. The crops are sprayed to 
 control diseases and some of the lambs
 and cattle are sent to market.
