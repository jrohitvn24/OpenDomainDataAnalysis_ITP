 Delivery of national newspapers is via
 Shawbury.  These papers are only      
 delivered to the main village and not 
 to the outlying areas.   However the  
 regional newspaper is available to all
 areas, this is delivered each evening 
 Monday to Saturday.  The Shropshire   
 Star is read widely throughout the    
 entire region.  Local radio is a      
 recent addition and is very much      
 appreciated by the Stanton villagers. 
 Local and National news is given equal
 coverage.  Television was found in    
 most homes and is probably the most   
 commonly used media form.  Video      
 recordings of national events is now  
 becoming popular  with farmers and    
 those people working throughout       
 daylight hours.
