		<content> Supermarkets make certain items       
 difficult to find. Also noisy. Small  
 shops are less crowded and more       
 personal. Supermarkets have more      
 variety to tempt the shopper. Small   
 shops are more fun to potter in but   
 can be more expensive. The smaller    
 shgops are more specialist and give   
 advice. Most goods can be obtained    
 under the one roof in a supermarket.  
 Children buy items for a variety of   
 reasons; because their friends have   
 got them, attractive packaging,       
 because they have seen it advertised  
 on television or because it is new. It
 may be presented as something exciting
 to own. Collecting is also another    
 reason. For ornaments and to adorn a  
 bedroom. The trend appears to be for  
 larger stores
