		<content>The only residential part in our area  
is the north end of Combe. The first   
house to be built in this end was in   
1909. Shortly after this some council  
houses were built but these are now    
privately owned. The reasons for the   
growth of Combe are increased car      
ownership and the opening of Combe     
halt. People can live in Combe and work
elsewhere. The older houses in the     
north part of Combe are almost all made
of brick under a Stonesfield slate     
roof. Many have dry stone garden walls.
We have written more about the houses  
of Combe on page 6 and a report about  
the amenities in Combe is included     
in an interview we did with a long     
time resident of Combe, Mrs Calcott,   
and have written on page 10.
