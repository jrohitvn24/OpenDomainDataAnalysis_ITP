		<title>11Tamar Valley,Local History 2</title>
		<content> Some{historical sites}are situated on{
 derelict land. There was extensive    
{mining}in the area and there are many 
 remains of old mining works. Also many
 adits, the location of which are not  
 always known making walking in the    
 area a hazard. Old lime kilns can be  
 found, their fumes once thought to be 
 a cure for bronchitis. On the Devon   
 side of the Tamar there is an entrance
 to what was once a Roman Fort.        
 There are also remains of old quays, a
 reminder of the days of the once      
 flourishing{trade}that made the area  
 prosperous. On the shores can be      
 found ballast stones left behind by   
 the trading vessels.                  
 Finally one can find one or two       
 examples of underground store houses  
 and a butter larder, a reminder of{   
{home-life}in the days before          
 refrigerators.                        </content>
