		<title>12Middlewood Station.</title>
		<content>   {Middlewood station}is rather       
 unusual as there is no road leading to
 it.                                   
    It is a ten minute walk to{High    
{Lane}and there are no signposts       
 giving directions.  The station is    
 covered in litter, and the paint is   
 flaking, but the graffiti is kept back
 and the station is set in beautiful   
 surroundings.  There is one train     
 every hour through the day and extra  
 ones in rush hours.  The trains serve 
{Hazel Grove,Manchester,Stockport}to   
 the North.{Disley, New Mills,Whaley   
{Bridge and Buxton}to the South.  A    
 return ticket from Manchester to      
 Middlewood in 2nd class is Â£1.17.  The
 first train is before 7 am and the    
 last train is after 11 pm, so there is
 always transport for the early birds  
 and the late ones home.
