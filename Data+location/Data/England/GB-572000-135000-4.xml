		<content>St. Mary's Church, Goudhurst, stands on
the highest point in the area, 127     
metres above sea level.  It is the     
oldest building in the village part    
dating back to the early 12C. There    
are some l5C brasses in the church.    
The tower is approximately 17 metres   
high and was re-built after the        
original one collapsed when the        
spire was struck by lightning in       
1637. The spire was not added thus     
leaving a squat square tower. The bell 
chamber contains 8 bells, 7 trebles    
and 1 tenor. Most date from the 18C.   
From the tower which is often open     
to the public,one can see about 5l     
churches when visibility is good.      
The churchyard was the scene of        
gunfighting when the notorious         
Hawkhurst gang of smugglers was        
defeated by the villagers in l747.
