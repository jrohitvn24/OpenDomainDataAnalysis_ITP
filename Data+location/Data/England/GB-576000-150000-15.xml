		<title>15A WASTE DISPOSAL TIP</title>
		<content> Furfield Landfill used to be called   
 Furfield Quarry. The quarrying of     
 ragstone here started in the early    
 1950's and finished in 1964. Now it is
 a waste disposal tip taking 90%       
 commercial rubbish, such as builder's 
 rubble, and 10% household rubbish. It 
 has been in operation for about 5     
 years, but there was, and still is,   
 considerable local opposition to its  
 existence, since its south side is    
 bordered by the Loose Stream. The     
 operators say that the tip takes no   
 toxic substances and there is no      
 pollution of the stream from the tip's
 5250000 sq.ft. A Monitoring Committee,
 which includes representatives from   
 the operators, the KCC, the Water     
 Authority and local organizations and 
 rsidents, meets regularly. Some people
 still fear for the future of the      
 stream.                               </content>
