		<content> Behind Lytham windmill is the old     
 lifeboat house.It is no longer used by
 the R.N.L.I.due to the construction of
 a new lifeboat house.It was first     
 built in 1844 and was adopted by the  
 R.N.L.I. in 1851.The first ship was   
 the{"Eleanor Cecily"}after Mrs Clifton
 whose family funded the scheme.The    
 boat,unfortunately,capsised and 6 of  
 the 9 crew drowned.At present the     
 Council are renovating it into a      
 maritime or lifeboat museum.          
   The new lifeboat house,originally a 
 mussel purification  station ,opened  
 in 1959.The present lifeboat is an    
 off-shore boat,an inshore vessel is   
 used for minor incidents.There have   
 been 16 rescues in the last 12 months.
 20 crewmen are on call at this        
 station.At night both boats are       
 launched as the inshore boat cannot go
 out in the dark alone.                </content>
