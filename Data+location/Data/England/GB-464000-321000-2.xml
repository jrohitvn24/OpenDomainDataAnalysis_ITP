		<title>02Vale View Farm</title>
		<content> The farm which is 130 acres overlooks 
 the Vale of Belvoir. The farm is      
 mainly grassland and the main product 
 is milk. The herd of 50 cows is milked
 twice a day and the milk goes to      
 Nottingham each morning.The farm work 
 is done by Mr. and Mrs.Hyslop and     
 their son Mark.The day starts at      
 5.30am.The milking starts at 6am. and 
 ends at 8am. when they have breakfast.
 After this the calves are fed. They   
 keep most of the 50 calves born each  
 year. Some will replace the cows in   
 the herd and the rest are kept to     
 produce meat.Mrs. Hyslop feeds the    
 calves twice a day on a milk mixed    
 with warm water.After 6 weeks the     
 calves are taken off milk and given   
 calf feed.
