		<content> There are 8 senior citizen bungalows  
 behind Westbury Court Home for the    
 Elderly. In 1985 there are 6 widows, a
 spinster and a married couple. The    
 bungalows comprise an entrance porch  
 with a built in shed, hall, lounge,   
 bedroom, kitchen and bathroom, gas    
 centrally heated. There is a bell     
 system in the bedroom and bathroom    
 which communicates with the Home if   
 necessary. Four bungalows have gardens
 with the churchyard wall at the bottom
 2 abut the Gardens Car Park and the   
 remaining 2 have borders of flowers   
 around their bungalows. The seat on   
 the lawn affords rest for the         
 residents of the Home who are able to 
 go out walking. All properties are    
 administered by the Council and are   
 only let to the over 60's.
