		<title>04Chatteris - Horseway History</title>
		<content> We talked to an old lady who was born 
 at Horseway.  She told us that in 1903
 between the Sixteen Foot Bridge and   
 Horseway Bridge there were six        
 thatched cottages that burnt down and 
 were never rebuilt.  The lady, who was
 born in one of the cottages, said that
 her father was a pig man for the local
 farmer and that other people in the   
 row worked on the land.  After the    
 fire she moved to the Paddy House     
 which was built in the second field   
 south of the lock.  The house was     
 named after the Irish workers who came
 to dig the dykes that drained the     
 fenland.                              
                                       
 On Sundays the local community        
 attended Horseway Chapel.  This was   
 between Horseway Bridge and Coulson's 
 Farm and was attached to the Parish   
 Church.                               </content>
