		<content>{WEATHER:-}as the area lies at the     
 eastern side of the Pennines, there is
 more precipitation, rain and snow with
 low cloud often prevailing.           
 Temperatures are cooler due to the    
 height of the land and exposed        
 position.                             
{CONSERVATION:-}much of the land is    
 privately owned and closed to the     
 public which has helped to preserve   
 the area in its matural state. The    
 Derbyshire Naturalists Trust has an   
 interest in the area.                 
{FOOTPATHS:-}though not well walked    
 there are footpaths and bridleways    
 reasonably preserved and signposted.  
{ANIMALS:-}the moorland and wooded     
 areas provide food and cover for      
 animals. The following have been seen:
 brown hare, badgers, foxes, moles,    
 bats, rabbits, stoats, weasel,        
 fieldmice and voles.                  </content>
