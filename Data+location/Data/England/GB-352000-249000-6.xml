		<title>06Water in the Bodenham area</title>
		<content> The River Lugg is one of the main     
 attractions in Bodenham.The river is  
 the responsibility of the Welsh Water 
 Authority. The manager is Mr C J Jones
 Fishermen enjoy fishing this length of
 river because it is well stocked with 
 many different fish including chub,   
 dace, pike, perch, trout and sometimes
 salmon.                               
 The deepest part of the river is 20   
 feet deep by a place called the Weir  
 House.In the winter the river         
 sometimes floods and covers fields and
 the road.                             
 In the Bodenham area there are 5 miles
 of river and it provides drinking     
 water, attractive walks along the     
 banks, good fishing, and lots of fun  
 providing care is taken when playing  
 near water.                           
 An expanse of water has gathered in   
 the gravel pits.&lt;see page 14 >>       </content>
