		<title>16A Hunton Girl's Spare Time</title>
		<content>   Tuesday is my busiest day. It begins
 when my alarm wakens me  and the radio
 goes on automatically.  I like Radio 1
 best and listen to it  most  mornings.
 Some of my friends play games on their
 computers before school. Others  watch
 breakfast TV or play with toys.       
   After 3.30,lessons done, I play with
 my sisters then watch  my favourite TV
 programme 'Beat the Teacher.'At 5.30 I
 go to  Crakehall Brownies  with  Tawny
 Owl and five other Hunton girls.  I am
 an elf. I like working for badges.    
   By 7p.m. we have arrived  at  Hunton
 Institute Youth Club. Children of  all
 ages go.  We raise money for games and
 sports equipment by sponsored walks.  
 Our new trampolette is ACE! I have fun
 playing rounders against other  clubs.
 I go to bed at 8.30 but I usually read
 an Enid Blyton book which helps me  to
 get to sleep.                         </content>
