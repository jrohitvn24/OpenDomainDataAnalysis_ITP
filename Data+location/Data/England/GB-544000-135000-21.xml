<title>21Hodore Farm, 25 Years on</title>
<content>

I am Geordie's Daddy and I'm now 63. We still own the farm. Our Dairy herd was sold in 2004 after expanding to 150 cows. Ours was the last dairy farm in the parish. We have converted many of the farm buildings to offices and workshops, and the rents from these is now our main source of income. The farm (with more rented land, now 400 acres plus woodland) is operated under a share farming agreement with Giles Swift from Withyham, who supplies the labour and machinery, growing arable crops. A few cattle are grazed on some of the land remaining in grass. Bill Cottington, now 71, still does occasional work for us and has spent his whole working life here at Hodore. Geordie works locally in forestry and fencing, Louise, his sister, teaches nearby and has 3 children and lives on the farm. Emily, another sister, has been working for a windfarm business, and his brother Toby is a brewer in London. Rachel his mother is an accomplished botanical artist.   &lt;br />
