		<title>11A Crossing Keeper's Life.</title>
		<content> The road through{Stretton Heath}is    
 crossed by the Shrewsbury to Welshpool
 railway line.{Mrs.Vasilewski}lives by 
 the crossing and it's her job to open 
 the gates when you ring the bell.The  
 gates stay open from{9 p.m.till 4 a.m.
 because there are no trains then,but  
 she has to close them before the first
 train of the day.After that she goes  
 back to bed before the{7.30}milk      
 tanker,which is normally the first    
 vehicle.                              
  Mrs.Vasilewski opens the gate between
{20}and{60}times daily but isn't grumpy
 even if you call when she's cooking   
 chips,like we did.On Sunday she saw   
 the new{Sprinter}train going to the   
 Transport Festival at Welshpool.She'll
 miss her job when the system changes- 
 British Rail plan to put in automatic 
 barriers before very long.
