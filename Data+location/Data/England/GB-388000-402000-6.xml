		<title>06Biography - Father A. George</title>
		<content>   At our school, St. Margaret's we    
 have a priest called Father George. He
 has been a priest for 25 years. He is 
 the vicar of St. Margaret's Church,   
 which is Church of England. He used to
 work in a timber yard before he became
 a priest. He felt he had to become a  
 priest so he did. He visits the sick, 
 elderly and poor people. He needs to  
 collect money for the poor, Churches  
 overseas, and schools. He has been    
 coming to teach at our school for 14  
 years.                                
   It takes one to one and a half hours
 to prepare a sermon. Not a lot of     
 people go to church. In his spare time
 he makes models of trains and he likes
 reading. On his day off, if it is     
 nice, he goes out somewhere but when  
 it is unpleasant he makes some models.
