		<content>     The alley next to Baylis Court    
 Secondary School is absolutely        
 covered with litter.  Nobody cares    
 about hygiene and people throw their  
 litter about anywhere.  This place    
 could be cleaned and made more        
 pleasant.                             
     The sort of rubbish that is dumped
 there is bundles of newspapers, tyres,
 mattresses, and plastic wrappers.  The
 rubbish is dumped there by people who 
 can not be bothered to go to a waste  
 disposal site.  This rubbish is       
 dangerous to domestic animals as well 
 as the public.                        
     If there were policemen on patrol 
 and fines were enforced, people would 
 think twice before they threw the     
 litter.  The authorities say this     
 costs a lot of money and they don't   
 have money to spare.  More litter bins
 would also be an improvement.         </content>
