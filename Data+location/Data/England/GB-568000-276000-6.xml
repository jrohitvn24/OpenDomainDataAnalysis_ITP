		<title>06 Beck Row Village Hall</title>
		<content> Beck Row Village Hall was built in    
1830 and is constructed of flint with a
pantile roof.  It was originally built 
as a Chapel or Place of Worship, and   
purchased by public subscription and a 
tablet near the base of the building   
marked P.M. stands for Primitive       
Methodist.  Just above the foundation  
level,many initials are inscribed and  
also the names of the trustees when it 
was built.  The building is still in   
the care of trustees,who are           
represented on the recently formed     
Community Association who are raising  
funds to build a new Community Centre  
either on the site of the existing hall
or on another site behind the School.  
The Village Hall is used for various   
functions such as whist drives,jumble  
sales,village meetings,discos,over 60  
club and many other activities.
