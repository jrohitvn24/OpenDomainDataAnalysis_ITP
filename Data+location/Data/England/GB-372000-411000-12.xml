		<content> relatively undisturbed.Great Crested  
 Grebes are now common and other birds 
 such as Herons and Whooper Swans are  
 increasing in number.Wild flowers such
 as Devils-bit Scabious,Knapweed and   
 Sweet Cicely grow there.The most      
 common tree is the Alder but evergreen
 conifers are being planted.It is hoped
 to create an animal habitat.          
 The country park is easily reached by 
 public transport and there is a car   
 park.There is a country park warden   
 who liaises with local schools and    
 leads guided walks in the summer.     
 Beneath the water is Horrobin Mill.It 
 was a fulling mill and bleachworks    
 from 1780 to 1941.Many bleachworks and
 papermills further down the valley    
 were once powered by Bradshaw Brook.A 
 few interesting remains of this       
 industrial past can be seen on the    
 nature trail.                         </content>
