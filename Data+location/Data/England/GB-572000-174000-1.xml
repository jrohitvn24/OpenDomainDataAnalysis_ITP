    The area covered in this survey is 
part of a peninsula of land between the
River Thames to  the north and the     
River Medway to the south.  There was  
one principal settlement, the historic 
village of Cliffe mentioned in the     
original Domesday.  Then it comprised  
of meadow, woods of l2 pence value and 
l church with 2 servants.  Life has    
changed little with the church still   
dominant in the centre of a village    
surrounded by farmland, of drained     
marshes or meadow and cleared fields   
for cereals.  Fruit trees have replaced
original woodlands to provide a        
picturesque scene in late spring when  
in full bloom.Old traditional buildings
are at the heart of the village.
