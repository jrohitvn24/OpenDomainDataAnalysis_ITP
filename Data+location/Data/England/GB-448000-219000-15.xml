		<content>We carried out a survey that was       
completed by 61% of people living in   
the village. The most common areas of  
employment followed by adults were:    
 Clerical    12.2%    Sales      4.8%  
 Education   10.5%    Finance    4.4%  
 Industry     7.8%    Building   4.1%  
 Agriculture  7.1%    Transport  3.7%  
 Services     5.8%    Law        1.7%  
 Medicine     5.8%                     
                                       
We asked how far people travel to      
work with the following results:       
  0- 5 miles  22%    5-10 miles 38%    
 10-25 miles  31%   25-50 miles 4%     
      more than 50 miles  5%           
                                       
We were surprised that people travel   
more than 50 miles to work but we      
believe that they may travel even      
further when the M40 Motorway from     
Oxford to Birmingham is built nearby.  </content>
