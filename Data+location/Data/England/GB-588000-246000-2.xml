		<title>02TOPOGRAPHY : ACTON/LAVENHAM</title>
		<content>The area is a low plateau with surface 
drainage towards the S.west.  The bed- 
rock is chalk, some overlaid by boul-  
der clay.  An area of glacial gravel   
occurs in the N.east; this is now con- 
cealed by Lavenham outskirts. A second 
area of gravel in the S.west was for-  
merly used for extraction of aggre-    
gates. One pit is now a landfill site  
and one used for preparing Ready-Mix   
concrete. Alluvial deposits lie along  
the Chad Brook.  The landscape has a   
well-treed aspect owing to the exten-  
sive acreage of Lineage, Crabtree and  
Paradise Woods, some smaller stands of 
timber in remaining hedgerows.  The    
traditional building materials are     
brick, flint, weatherboarding, lath and
plaster with tiles for roofs. Steel    
cement and asbestos appear in farm     
buildings with corrugated iron roofs.
