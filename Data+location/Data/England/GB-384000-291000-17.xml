		<title>17The Railway Walk, Wombourne</title>
		<content> In 1966 the Worcester to Wolverhampton
main railway  line was closed. The land
was owned by the  railway but has since
been bought by local councils,the rails
have been lifted and  the derelict line
converted into a pleasant walk.        
 The  five  and  a  half  mile  stretch
between  Castlecroft, to the  north  of
Wombourne, and Wall Heath, to the south
of Himley is known as the Railway Walk.
The Wombourne Station building has been
restored  and now  provides a permanent
exhibition of earlier  days as well  as
what the area now offers.              
 Part  of the Walk can be used by horse
riders  where  barriers  separate   the
horses  from pedestrians. Most  of  the
time the Walk is  used  by families out
for a pleasant walk in the countryside.
 In the  early morning the joggers take
over. Some  are out  for  a fun run but
others train here for marathons.       </content>
