		<title>12Vandalism At ST.Michael's</title>
		<content> Father John from St. Michaels was     
 interviewed about a recent incident of
 vandalism in the church.He told us    
 that the vandals  had stolen a hand   
 bell,the front door key,a religous    
 book and possibly some food.All these 
 items were retrieved after the crime  
 except for the food.                  
  Fortunately the damage to the church 
 was minimal.The vandals had trodden   
 orange squash into the carpet on the  
 centre aisle.They had also ridden a   
 bicycle along the aisle which had done
 further damage to the carpet.         
  There has only been one other        
 incident of damage in the church.This 
 was when a man came into the building 
 with a shotgun.He fired the gun at a  
 stained glass window causing it to    
 shatter.                              
  After the most recent incident a     
 party of cleaners came to help.       </content>
