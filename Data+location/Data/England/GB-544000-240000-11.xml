		<content> Feeding the Family:Most people have   
 one cooked meal a day consisting of a 
 meat or fish dish with potatoes and   
 another vegetable,usually followed by 
 a cooked pudding,fresh fruit or cake. 
 The meat is usually Beef,Lamb,Pork or 
 Chicken.  There are a few vegetarians 
 who replace the meat dish with a pulse
 and nut dish.  Many people have this  
 meal in the evening as they are out   
 all day.  The exceptions being farmers
 and the elderly who have it at noon.  
 The majority don't eat cooked break-  
 fast but eat toast and cereals.       
 Tea,coffee and soft drinks are the    
 most common beverages.                
 Most people have a deep-freeze which  
 has greatly enlarged the varieties    
 of foods eaten throughout the year.
