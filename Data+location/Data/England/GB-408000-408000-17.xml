		<title>17Meltham's Coal Mine</title>
		<content>    On{Tuesday 18th June, 1985}we went 
 to visit the old{drift mine}in        
{Meltham.}The{coal}was used for the    
{mill boilers}to work{steam}           
{engines.}The{coal}that was brought    
 from the{mine}was not particularly    
 good.The{coal}was dug out by hand.In  
{1862}the railway station was built in 
{Meltham}and it brought cheaper{coal}to
{Meltham}and so eventually the{pit}was 
 forced to close down.Today there is   
 very little vegetation on the{spoil   
{heap.}At the bottom of the{spoil heap 
 there is a stream and we found pieces 
 of{coal}in the stream washed down from
 the{shale.}We found three to four     
{mines}altogether. We also found some  
{clay}which we have brought back to    
 school and put in the school kiln.    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
