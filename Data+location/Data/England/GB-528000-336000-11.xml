		<title>11The Brass Band - Kirton</title>
		<content> We have played at one concert and four
 more are lined up for the near future.
 I enjoy playing very much and it is   
 nice that my sister and cousins play  
 as well. After our concerts we split  
 up and go over things that could have 
 been played better,but sometimes we   
 don't have long between concerts,so we
 have to practice new pieces straight  
 away.there is a back room which we go 
 into to catch up with the main band if
 we don't understand something.Our     
 conductor is called Mr.A.Morris and he
 has conducted us since we began.      
   Kirton has had a Brass Band since   
 1870 which makes it 115 years old,so  
 we are very proud of playing in the   
 band and we hope that in 115 years    
 time there will still be a Kirton     
 Brass  Band.
