		<title>16A Traffic Survey</title>
		<content>    One Tuesday afternoon, early in the
 Summer Term, our class did a 1/2 hour 
 count of vehicles passing the school  
 on the Keighley-Kendal trunk road.    
    In that time 133 vehicles had      
 passed in the direction of Settle, of 
 which the majority (105) were cars.   
    154 vehicles went past going       
 towards Skipton. Again cars (112) were
 the majority, with wagons(35) coming  
 second.                               
    We calculated that if these figures
 were typical, it would mean           
 approximately 4,600 vehicles going    
 through the village in an eight hour  
 day.                                  
    Most of the cars we saw were either
 blue, white or red.                   
    We counted how many people were in 
 each car that passed, and noticed that
 approximately 1/2 had two occupants,  
 1/3 had only one,1/6 had more than 2. </content>
