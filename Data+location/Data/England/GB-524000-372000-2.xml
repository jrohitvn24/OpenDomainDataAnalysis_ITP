		<content> In 1818 a Church Sunday School        
 existed in which 12 children were     
 taught. Â£300 was raised by            
 subscription and an all age school for
 a 100 pupils was erected in 1874.     
 Centenary celebrations were held and a
 cake was provided by W.I. ladies. Each
 child was presented with cake and a   
 commemorative mug. A book was made by 
 scholars recording the school past and
 present. In 1977 Jubilee celebrations 
 included tea and sports; Jubilee mugs 
 and Crown pieces were presented. A    
 donation was sent to the Prince of    
 Wales' appeal from funds raised. Sadly
 the school was closed in 1980 but it  
 has recently been successfully and    
 sympathetically converted into a      
 private dwelling.
