		<title>09NEW BLACKSMITH IN CLAYPOLE</title>
		<content>                                       
       The blacksmith business was     
 started in a garage in Newark thirty  
 three years ago by my grandad and     
 carried on by my uncle, Maurice Leach,
 eight years ago. From Newark it moved 
 to Claypole because the business      
 expanded and we needed more room for  
 machinery.                            
       The three blacksmiths make items
 such as spiral staircases, gates,     
 grain hoppers and, more recently,     
 nuclear fall-out shelters. My uncle   
 deals with all types of people, from  
 the gardener who wants his spade      
 mending to the man who decides there  
 is a nuclear war coming soon.         
       He has a lot of modern machinery
 including welders, steel guillotines, 
 electric grinders as well as the      
 traditional anvil and hammer.
