		<content>GENERAL VIEW OF SURVEY BLOCK           
                                       
Our survey block covers an area of very
hilly grasslands,less hilly farmlands  
and a flatter area used by the R.A.F.  
Two of our kilometre squares contain   
the outer perimeter of land owned by   
the London Zoological Society known as 
Whipsnade Park Zoo. The highest area in
the block includes Ivinghoe Beacon,    
part of the chain of hills known as the
Chilterns.The Beacon is the site of an 
Ordnance Survey triangulation point and
is much visited by sightseers due to   
the commanding views given of the      
surrouding countryside.One corner of   
our block contains part of the village 
of Dagnall, and we have included       
general information about life in the  
village in the survey.
