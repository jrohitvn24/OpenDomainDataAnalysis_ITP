		<content> For two baller you need two small     
 balls and a wall. You throw the balls 
 onto a wall after each other and you  
 sing a little song to go with the     
 game. This game can be played with    
 only one person at a time. Here is one
 of the songs that we sing as we play: 
 Chocolate biscuit down the lane, tell 
 me how to spell my name, and then you 
 spell out your name. Another game is  
 skips. You need a rope and            
 yourselves. You try not to step on the
 rope. The skipping rope goes round for
 so many beats then as you jump in they
 turn the rope round with one person on
 each end.As we skip we sing: Mothers  
 in the kitchen  doing a bit of        
 stitching in comes somebody and pushes
 her out. Now when one person goes in  
 another one has to follow and the one 
 that was in first has to go  out.
