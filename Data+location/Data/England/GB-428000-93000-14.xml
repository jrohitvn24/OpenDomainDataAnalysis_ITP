		<content> Most of the children in Pennington    
 play on the Common,where there are    
 some slides and some swings.There is  
 also a Sports Field nearby where local
 football matches are played.Recently a
 B.M.X track was designed for the      
 Common.Not far from the village is    
 Rookes Gardens,a park which has an    
 adventure playground.Everton has a    
 recreation ground where local football
 matches are played.The Sports Ground  
 near the Fire Station in Lymington was
 the proposed site for a Sports Centre 
 for Lymington but the idea was turned 
 down.                                 
 Every year the Fair and the Circus    
 visit Pennington Common.              
 Local beaches are an attraction for   
 local and visiting people in          
 summer.Yachting and visits to The Isle
 of Wight and abroad are also popular.
