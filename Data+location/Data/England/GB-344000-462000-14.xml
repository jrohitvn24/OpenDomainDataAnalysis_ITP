		<content> Lee Hirst and Chris Huntington asked  
 Mr. Alan Alker, a Vale of Lune rugby  
 player, some questions about the club.
 The Vale have 5 senior teams, 1 colts 
 team and 8 mini teams. The club has   
 been running for about 60 years. The  
 first XV have about 45 to 50 matches  
 in the season, their average          
 attendance is about 300 people per    
 home match. The Vale's most memorable 
 match was when they played in the     
 Lancashire Cup Final in 1985 and lost 
 11-7 to Waterloo. The most famous club
 ever to play at the Vale was the      
 Australian International XV.          
             Both Lee and Chris play   
 for a mini team at the Vale as well as
 playing for the Morecambe High school 
 teams.
