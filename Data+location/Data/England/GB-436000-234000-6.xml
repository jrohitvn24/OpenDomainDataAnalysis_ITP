		<content> NILL FARM IS OWNED BY MR. IRVINE.     
 THERE ARE 7 IN THE FAMILY AND THEY    
 HAVE LIVED THERE FOR 11 YEARS ALTHOUGH
 THE FARM HAS BEEN THERE FOR 250 YEARS.
 THEY HAVE 140 MILKING COWS, 6 PONIES  
 WHICH THEY HUNT, AND FARM 340 ACRES OF
 LAND. THEY HAVE IMPROVED THE FARM BY  
 ADDING MODERN MILKING PARLOURS,TENNIS 
 COURT AND THE SWIMMING POOL.          
 THE FARM BELONGED TO THE LOCAL CHURCH 
 AT ONE TIME AND THEY USED IT TO REAR  
 PIGS. THE NAME 'NILL' MEANS 'AN OLD   
 CLUMP OF TREES' BUT IT IS NOT KNOWN   
 WHICH TREES EXACTLY. THE DOVECOTE WAS 
 MENTIONED IN THE DOMESDAY BOOK.       
 MR. IRVINE IS WORRIED ABOUT ALL THE   
 FERTILISERS WHICH MANY FARMERS USE TO 
 REAR THEIR CORN AND HE HAS STOPPED    
 GROWING IT AS IT WAS KILLING THE WILD 
 LIFE ON HIS FARM.                     
 THE HIGHLIGHT OF THE VISIT WAS BEING  
 INVITED TO SWIM IN THEIR OUTDOOR POOL.</content>
