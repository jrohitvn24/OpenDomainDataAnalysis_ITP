		<title>19The Church, North Boarhunt</title>
		<content>{St. Nicholas' Church}in Boarhunt is   
 extremely picturesque. The church     
 itself is surrounded by graves, the   
 oldest being closest to the church,   
 the newer ones situated to the east of
 the church.                           
 In the graveyard is a very large yew  
 tree which was probably planted when  
 the church was built.                 
 The church has a{North door           
{'Devil's Door'}that is now bricked    
 up as is the South door. It has a     
 small belfry. The walls are built with
 flint and the roof is tiled but the   
 North wall has been faced. A wooden   
 arch and gate leads to the church.    
 This church is unusual as it is not   
 linked to a village, but has the      
 Manor Farm adjacent to it.
