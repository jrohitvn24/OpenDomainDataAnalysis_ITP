		<title>01Bolton by Bowland and Holden</title>
		<content>  This area is situated 7 miles north  
 west of Clitheroe in Lancashire,3     
 miles off the busy A59 where the roads
 from Slaidburn,Settle,Hellifield and  
 Gisburn meet.There is one village of  
 Bolton by Bowland and a small hamlet  
 called Holden.There are several       
 farmhouses scattered through the area 
 and a small group of houses in Bolton 
 Park Estate,where there used to be a  
 hall and servant cottages.            
  It is a farming community with no    
 industry,only one village shop,a part 
 time hairdressers and a small wood    
 workshop.It is very quiet and         
 picturesque,a popular place for       
 visitors.The population has decreased 
 during the last 50 years to 263 on the
 electoral roll as farms have          
 employed fewer workers,and the young  
 people have left to live in the towns.
