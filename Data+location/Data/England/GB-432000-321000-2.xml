		<content>{SEWAGE SCHEME}                        
   In the past people in Hartshorne    
 haven't been able to build more houses
 because there weren't any sewage pipes
 to carry the sewage away. Now they are
 putting new sewage pipes along Repton 
 Road and Dunsmore Lane. It will take  
 at least a year. Then they might build
 new houses.                           
   There would be more children to make
 friends with. They could build a cafe,
 or a discotheque or an adventure      
 playground. We need some more clubs in
 the village; a sports club for the    
 kids and a club for the elderly people
 so they can get together and enjoy    
 themselves.                           
   However, if they build more estates,
 it will be even noisier. There would  
 be less farm land and fewer footpaths.
 We wouldn't feel that we were living  
 in a country village.                 </content>
