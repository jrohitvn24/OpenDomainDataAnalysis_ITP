		<content>{Farming.                              
{    }The area is mainly used for      
 arable farming, usual crops being     
 cereals with some sugar beet, some    
 experimental crops are grown in the   
 area including lupins and borage.     
     Farmers do crop very intensively  
 but are fairly conservation minded    
 leaving a reasonable number of hedges 
 and trees, and also small ponds. Many 
 trees have been planted over the last 
 few years, Essex have had a policy of 
 encouraging the planting of native    
 trees.                                
     There are very few animals on the 
 farm with no intensive animal         
 husbandry.                            
     There is one market garden growing
 a wide variety of vegetables which are
 sold locally.                         
     No computer run farms in this     
 block.                                </content>
