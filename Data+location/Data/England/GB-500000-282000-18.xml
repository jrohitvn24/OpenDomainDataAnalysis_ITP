		<title>18WILDLIFE ON THE NENE</title>
		<content>    If you wander down the banks of the
 river Nene you will see a variety of  
 wildlife. In the river there is a host
 of different fish, pike, perch, roach,
 eels, bream and tench. The bird life  
 includes swans, moorhens, coots,      
 mallards and herons. Frogs also spawn 
 there.                                
                                       
    Pollution does not seem to be a    
 serious problem here, although some   
 anglers have been criticised by       
 conservationists and local wildlife   
 wardens for using lead weights and    
 leaving fishing line in the river.    
 There is also some concern about the  
 effect of pesticides on fish and      
 birds. Rubbish from holiday boats on  
 the river and the possible effect of  
 acid rain on the local forests have   
 also been mentioned as hazards.
