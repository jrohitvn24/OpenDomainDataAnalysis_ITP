		<content>   {St.Michael's Hospital} was         
originally the workhouse for paupers.It
has been completely renovated over the 
years and is now used for the care of  
the elderly and the dying.             
   There are seven wards;2 for male    
patients and 5 for female patients.At  
present there are about 115 patients   
with a high ratio of nursing staff to  
patients.St.Michael's has no casualty  
dept.,no childrens' ward and no        
operating theatre.                     
   The hospital provides a dayroom     
centre where elderly people can be     
cared for on a daily basis,while their 
relatives are at work.                 
   Volunteers,known as the league of   
friends ,raise funds to provide the    
patients with little extras.           
   The oldest patient is a lady of 104.
There is another hospital in Lichfield 
named the Victoria.                    </content>
