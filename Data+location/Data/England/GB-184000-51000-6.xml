		<title>06Farming, Then and Now</title>
		<content> Since 1945 there have been very       
 striking changes in the farming       
 pattern in this area.  Most farms     
 remain the same size though two of    
 them, Killiserth and Trewaters,are    
 farmed in conjunction with others. The
 chages are in th use made of the land 
 and of the houses situated there.     
 There is now very little dairy        
 farming, instead th farmers find beef 
 nd sheep rearing and corn growing more
 profitable enterprises requiring much 
 less labour.  The work is done with a 
 small team using tractor-driven,      
 electrically-operated machinery.      
 Horses are no longer needed and on    
 most farms there are no poultry and no
 pigs.  Farm cottages have become      
 superfluous so they have been sold and
 modernised to provide attractive      
 homes. Each farm still has its own    
 independent water supply              </content>
