		<content> Brownsea is famous as the place where 
 the{first-ever Scout camp,}organised  
 in 1907 by Lord Baden-Powell, was     
 held, and during 1985 there have been 
 celebrations on the island to         
 commemorate the 75th. anniversary of  
 the{Girl Guides}(founded 1910).       
 The original campsite on Brownsea,    
 plus the South Shore Lodge, continue  
 to be used by Scouts and Guides.      
 During the 1985 season 22 groups have 
 booked the South Shore Lodge,         
 including Guides from British         
 Columbia, Canada. In July 1985 there  
 were 18 Guides from the 31st and 32nd 
 St. Matthews Guide Company from       
 Northampton, on their 3rd visit to    
 Brownsea. They commented on how       
 unspoilt the island was and on its    
 historic associations with            
 Baden-Powell.
