		<content> We visited two farms in our area.     
 Brickhouse Farm stands almost in the  
 centre of the area and has 500 acres  
 which is entirely arable and this year
 was put down either to wheat or       
 barley.                               
 Stanstead Lodge Farm was a smaller    
 mixed farm of 170 acres. There has    
 been a farm here for over 400 years   
 and the old moat pond has been here   
 for the same period. It used to       
 contain fish which wandering monks    
 were free to catch.                   
 Most of the 170 acres were given over 
 to arable farming, and this year the  
 crops were peas, barley and two types 
 of wheat - ordinary wheat for making  
 bread and Durum wheat for the manu-   
 facture of pasta. The peas went for   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
