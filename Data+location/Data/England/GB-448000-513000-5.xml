		<title>05Andrew's Fire Station Visit</title>
		<content> On Wednesday we went to the Fire      
 Station and the Firemen showed us     
 inside of the{fire engine}and Anthony 
 drived. I was on a seat.  Then the    
 fireman said we had to get out and he 
 put his{breathing apparatus}on and his
 gas mask and he let us all have a go  
 at doing it. After that he got a      
 trumpet out and when it was my turn I 
 blowed it dead loud and the fireman   
 said I must of had a lot of breath.   
 The the fireman got a small black mat 
 out and he put it under the fire      
 engine and a fireman drove the fire   
 engine onto it. Then the fireman blew 
 it up with an oblong thing and it     
 lifted the fire engine up and we saw  
 underneath.Then we saw the hose get   
 put on and the fireman let us have a  
 go. Then another fireman got the{Simon
{Snorkel}out and one of the firemen    
 went up in it. It was the best.       </content>
