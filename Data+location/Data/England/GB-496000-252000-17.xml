		<content> The village has a well-kept playing   
 field which is used mainly by the men 
 for football in winter and cricket in 
 summer.Two football pitches are marked
 out and junior and senior teams play  
 regular matches.In summer the cricket 
 square is carefully tended.The cricket
 club has put up its own spacious      
 pavilion at the top of the field.The  
 ladies have on occasion used the field
 for rounders matches and netball      
 practices.People interested in        
 tennis,squash,badminton,golf or       
 swimming have to travel to facilities 
 outside the area.There is however a   
 privately owned tennis court available
 to some.The flourishing table tennis  
 club uses the Village Hall for its    
 matches.Friends of landowners get some
 pigeon and rabbit shooting and        
 fishing.Indoor games such as darts and
 pool are played in the public houses. </content>
