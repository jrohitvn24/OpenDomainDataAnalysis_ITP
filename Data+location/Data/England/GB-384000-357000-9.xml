		<title>09The Primitive Methodists</title>
		<content> Mr Joseph Bourne,the father of Hugh,  
was a farmer at Ford Hays Farm in the  
Parish of Stoke upon Trent.He had a    
fondness for strong drink,which was a  
beset-ment to him through a protracted 
life.Hugh's mother was habituated to   
the Church Of England made of worship, 
consequently she became strongly       
attacked and devoted to the religous   
practices and duties of the religion   
of her fathers.                        
  Bourne had been aware of the         
Methodists as a sect, that John Wesley 
had formed within the Church of        
England.One Sunday night in            
Macclesfield he watched the Methdodists
going to chapel and was impressed. He  
became a Methodist but people didn't   
like his type of Methodism. He changed 
to become a Primiive Methodist. This is
like the revivalist type of church.
