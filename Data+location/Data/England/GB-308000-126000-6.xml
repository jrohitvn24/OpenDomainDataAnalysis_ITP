		<title>06THE VILLAGE OF FITZHEAD</title>
		<content> Fitzhead is a small village with a    
 good community group which organises  
 beetle drives,rounders matches and    
 treasure hunts.Almost everyone attends
 the village fete and flower show.     
 In winter there is sledging on a      
 nearby hill.In summer many support the
 local cricket team.A stream runs      
 through the lower part of the         
 village,which people like to paddle in
 on hot days.Fitzhead and the          
 surrounding area is a popular place   
 for horse riding.                     
  An oak bench was donated to the churh
 by an American family to celebrate the
 marriage of their ancestors in the    
 village in 1585. The 15th century     
 screen and the church plate are the   
 greatest treasures.The church shares a
 magazine with Milverton and Halse.
