		<content>                                       
                                       
    THE REDOUBT IS PART OF THE MARTELLO
 TOWER DEFENCES WHICH WENT FROM        
 ALDEBURGH TO SEAFORD. SMALL TOWERS HAD
 ONLY ONE GUN BUT THE BIGGER REDOUBTS  
 HAD UP TO 10. THE HARWICH REDOUBT WAS 
 BUILT IN 1808 AND THE GRANITE BROUGHT 
 IN BY BARGE.  IT WAS BUILT ON A HILL  
 AND A HOUSE HAD TO BE KNOCKED DOWN TO 
 BUILD IT.  THEY EVEN HAD TO MOVE THE  
 ROAD TO LONDON TO BUILD IT!  THE      
 REDOUBT HAS A DRY MOAT.   THOUSANDS OF
 TONS OF EARTH WAS BROUGH FROM BATHSIDE
 ON DONKEYS TO SURROUND THE REDOUBT    
 WITH EARTHWORKS.                      
    THE REDOUBT TOOK THREE YEARS TO    
 BUILD AND COST ABOUT Â£50,000.  IT IS  
 NOW A MUSEUM AND IS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC
 EVERY SUNDAY.  THE HARWICH SOCIETY HAS
 COMPLETED MUCH OF THE RESTORATION     
 WORK.MONEY COMES FROM AN ANNUAL FETE. </content>
