		<title>12EVANGELICAL CHURCH HENFIELD.</title>
		<content> The Evangelical Free Church by Daniel.
   My Church is the Free Church in the 
 village.  It is a medium sized church 
 and has a Sunday School building built
 on.  The actual Church has about      
 forty benches and two aisles.  Where  
 the vicar stands is a preaching box   
 with a Bible in it.  In the left hand 
 corner there is an organ.  In front of
 that there are two steps going down   
 into the aisle.  The Sunday School    
 building is fairly large with a piano 
 and two tables at one end.  At the    
 sides there are chairs for people to  
 sit on.  Near the tables is a door    
 which leads into a kitchen.  At Sunday
 School we sing songs and say prayers. 
 We have a collection and go to our    
 classes.  In our classes we have      
 sheets of paper and we learn about    
 God.  After our  classes we go home.  
 Our Church is in the High Street.     </content>
