		<title>01INTRO. GT. AYTON  W. SECTION</title>
		<content> This is an area of gently undulating, 
 largely arable, farmland, about 80m.  
 above sea level.There is a steep sided
 ridge to the N.E.,rising to 90m.,     
 called Langbaurgh Ridge,that has been 
 deeply quarried for 'Whinstone'       
 (basalt) then partly infilled with    
 building and domestic rubbish. Though 
 most of the area is enclosed cropland 
 and pasture there are several woods,  
 totalling about 1 sq. km.. Tanton and 
 Tunstall are typical large farms that 
 were once villages. A network of lanes
 links these to the Cleveland          
 industrial area to the north. Half of 
 Gt.Ayton 'village' (population about  
 5000 ) is in our area, on the River   
 Leven with its trout and ducks.       
 Housing ranges from the picturesque   
 stone to functional modern brick.
