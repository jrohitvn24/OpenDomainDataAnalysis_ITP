		<title>10Swineshead Village Hall</title>
		<content> The village hall in Swineshead was    
 once the village hall. In recent years
 it has been modernised to provide such
 facilities as a kitchen and toilets.  
 Plans are underway for a storeroom to 
 be built onto the village hall.       
 The village hall is used on various   
 occassions throughout the year for a  
 variety of events ranging from a table
 tennis evening to a Parish Council    
 meeting.
