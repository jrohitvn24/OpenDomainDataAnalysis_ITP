 This area is just north of the        
 Cotswolds and its contours are        
 similar, rolling hills crossed by     
 small roads or tracks leading to stone
 built farmhouses. The village itself  
 is the only area of housing to any    
 degree and little new building has    
 been done for the past one hundred    
 years. The hillsides are divided into 
 fields, some have sheep or cattle in  
 them and others have crops growing.   
 There are three small copses of       
 deciduous woodland and trees are      
 planted alongside the roads and in the
 hedgerows giving an overall picture of
 a typical English countryside.        
 Numerous springs rise in the area and 
 even today are used in the outlying   
 farms for drinking.
