		<title>17A Steelworker's thoughts</title>
		<content>    I have worked at BSC,Rotherham     
 (Aldwarke site) for 26 years as a Coil
 Examiner in the Continuous Bar Mill.  
    At my mill 25% of the workforce    
 went 13 years ago when we changed from
 a four- to a three-shift system. Since
 1980 there have been many redundancies
 which would have been compulsory if   
 'volunteers' had not come forward.    
    I 'escaped' because of seniority   
 but I do not fancy the rest of my life
 on the dole or being shunted from one 
 job to another.                       
    When I left school in 1959 I could 
 have worked at New Stubbin or Aldwarke
 Collieries, Parkgate Chemical Works,  
 Old Parkgate Iron and Steel, Oxley's, 
 Manvers Coking Plant, Rotherham Power 
 Station, or the Gas Works amongst     
 others. All these places are now      
 closed and the jobs gone. Employment  
 has become an ever-decreasing circle. </content>
