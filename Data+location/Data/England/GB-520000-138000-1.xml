		<title>01Between Russ Hill &amp; Ruspers</title>
		<content> The area predominantly consists of    
 rough farmland which is gently        
 undulating to the southwest of the    
 area, towards Ruspers, and very flat  
 to the north west of the area near    
 Russ hill. The fields of rough grazing
 land are either fenced with wooden    
 posts and wire or consist of fairly   
 low hedges.                           
 The landscape is dotted with trees of 
 mixed variety. Near Russ hill (sq 3)  
 there is Gawick 200 and Airanes which 
 attract  large numbers of people in   
 the summer. Apart from this, the area 
 is sparsely populated with farms,     
 which are a mixture of dairy and sheep
 Towards Russ hill there is more       
 woodland,mainly deciduous with a few  
 conifers.
