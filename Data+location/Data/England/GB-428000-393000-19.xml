		<content> Despite much new building the         
 landscape still retains a rural look, 
 the housing being mainly on the       
 western slope of the valley and not   
 encroaching too much on the higher    
 slopes.Many of the older buildings    
 being isolated on the hillsides.      
 The hamlet of{Onesacre}consists of a  
 group of ancient stone buildings      
 namely,{Tophill}Farm,listed and built 
 in 1580,a large farmhouse,two listed  
 cruck barns,   {Low Fold}farmhouse a  
 17th. century building,{The Old School
{House,}part of which dates to         
 1100,{Coldwell Farm,}1853,and a few   
 cottages.In addition there are many   
 19th. century stone cottages on Church
 St.and close to the village centre.   
 Fields and small wooded areas dominate
 the western slopes of the Don,the     
 eastern slope being chiefly managed   
 conifer woodland.                     </content>
