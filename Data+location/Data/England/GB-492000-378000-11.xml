		<content>  My family own a small business which 
 started trading during the 1930s. At  
 that time the work was mainly motor   
 engineering and cycle repairs.  The   
 business continued through the next   
 thirty years mostly unchanged and     
 during the early 1970s was very much  
 involved in the sale of new cars and  
 motor cycles.  Because of a general   
 decline in living standards and the   
 consequent reduction of car sales, it 
 was at this time that the company     
 diversed into general steel           
 fabrication and the garage content    
 disposed of.  1975-82 saw a large     
 demand for steel storage containers   
 for domestic heating oil etc. and at  
 the height of this period some 3000   
 units per year were produced and      
 delivered to all parts of the U.K.
