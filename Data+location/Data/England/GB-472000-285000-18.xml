		<title>18H'borough Evangelical Church</title>
		<content> The church was formed in 1973 when a  
 group of Christians,mostly new to the 
 town,felt the need for an evangelical 
 fellowship on the Southern Estate.    
 Having no church building they rented 
 Farndon Fields School hall for their  
 worship.Over their twelve years the   
 church has expanded.It now has an     
 active Youth Club and Sunday School   
 and runs social events involving the  
 wider community.It sees its purpose as
 spreading the faith in the Southern   
 Estate,which it feels has many        
 "unbelievers!"To further its work the 
 church now realises that it needs a   
 building of its own and has purchased 
 0.75 acres of land in Bath St. for    
 this purpose.The design goes away from
 the conventional church building and  
 includes a hall,kitchen,lounge,games  
 room,2 classrooms and a chapel room.  
 The cost is Â£220000,Â£20000 now raised.</content>
