		<title>04School House Project</title>
		<content>    The School House Project is to     
 renovate the school house so it can be
 used by Corvedale playgroup and       
 school.                               
                                       
   The school house used to be the     
 school master's house but is now used 
 by Corvedale playgroup.It has fallen  
 into disrepair and therefore needed a 
 great deal of work.                   
                                       
   The project started as a unanimous  
 decision between the school and       
 playgroup committees.The money was    
 raised by sponsored events,dances,    
 school funds and wine and cheese      
 evenings.The jobs to be done are:put  
 in damp-proof coursing,make repairs to
 roof,replaster it,put in new skirting 
 boards demolish a wall and repaint the
 whole house.Most of the work was      
 voluntary and mostly done by parents. </content>
