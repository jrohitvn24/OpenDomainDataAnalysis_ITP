		<content> ll Pebworth W.I members made this     
 survey -  4 were born locally. 7 live 
 here to be near husbands' work places.
 average age is 42 yrs. We are married 
 with average of 3 children (mostly    
 living at home). Apart from housework 
 most do full, part time or voluntary  
 wprk, as teachers, secretaries,       
 physotherapists etc. We include 4     
 school governors, play group leader   
 and helper, 4 news sheet editors, 7   
 village hall committee members, 2     
 brownie pack leaders and a parish     
 councillor. 4 are regular church goers
 and we represent all political views. 
 To us, advantages of life here (peace,
 friendliness, all age groups) outweigh
 disadvantages( lack of public         
 transport and youth facilities,       
 parochialism). However, we detect a   
 lack of community spirit among new    
 comers to the village.                </content>
