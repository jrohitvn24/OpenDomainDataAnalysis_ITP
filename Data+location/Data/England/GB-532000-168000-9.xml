		<content>   South norwwod is an area of very    
 mixed architecture. The reason for    
 this is that the district has         
 developed over the last hundred years.
 During the Second World War many      
 houses were bombed and had to be      
 rebuilt.                              
   The Victorian villas were large with
 much decoration, such as large bay    
 windows, and arched windows. They may 
 have fancy iron work on the roof -    
 ridge or long window sills. Some      
 houses in the area have ornamental    
 towers and fancy porches. These       
 Victorian villas are usually set back 
 from the road with large gardens.     
   Houses are of the three-bedroom type
 and either semi-detached or built in  
 terraces. Rows of streets have        
 identical houses in them. The houses  
 are often gabied and have bay windows,
 situated near by are parades of shops.</content>
