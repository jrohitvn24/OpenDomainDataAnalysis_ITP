		<title>10Abberton Reservoir</title>
		<content>{Abberton Reservoir}is located South   
 of Colchester on the B1026 road. It   
 is one of the biggest reservoirs in   
 Essex, covering about 1200 acres. It  
 was built 57 years ago in 1928 to     
 store water for domestic use. There is
 a big white pumping station on the    
 North side of the reservoir.          
 The reservoir is divided into three   
 sections  by  two cause ways which    
 make one large area that has man made 
 concrete sides  and two smaller areas 
 that  have  natural sides. It is owned
 by the{South Essex Waterworks Company.
  Besides managing the actual reservoir
 in 1970 the company developed  an area
 of land by the side of it into a      
 nature reserve. People can now visit  
 the reserve and come to look at the   
 wide variety and large numbers of     
 birds that live there, or pass        
 through.                              </content>
