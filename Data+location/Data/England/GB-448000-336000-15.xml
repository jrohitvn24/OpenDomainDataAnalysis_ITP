		<content> On local estates, there are few       
 recreational areas apart from some    
 open playing spaces.                  
 Locally there are four public houses. 
 Between them they offer a wide range  
 of restaurant facilities, discos and  
 the occasional barbecue.              
 Bramcote Park provides a source of    
 recreational use. It has a cricket    
 square, pavilion and a training area  
 for the Nottingham Hoods, American    
 football team. On the nearby school   
 playing field there is a running track
 and several tennis courts available to
 the public.                           
 There are two golf courses in the     
 area. One is private and very         
 exclusive, the other is available to  
 the public.                           
 There are numerous public footpaths   
 and bridleways.
