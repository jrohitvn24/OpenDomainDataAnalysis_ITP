 James Taylor's farm at Abberton has   
 attracted a lot of visitors since he  
 volunteered it under the Countyside   
 Commission's Farms Project which      
 started 1O years ago. The aim was to  
 assess how commercial farming and     
 conservation practices could be       
 intigrated. Lord Belstead, Minister of
 State with responsibility for land use
 and agricultural resources recently   
 visited the farm and was pleased to   
 see the tree planting that had taken  
 place as a result of Dutch Elm        
 disease. A lot of tree planting is    
 part of an overall plan to reshape    
 fields for modern methods, while      
 conserving some old habitats and      
 creating new areas to encourage       
 wildlife.
