		<content>      The only roads are in the eastern
 section of the block. To the west you 
 only find footpaths, which naturally  
 limits access so the area is rural.   
      Cars are the main form of        
 transport in the east. Their numbers  
 increase greatly during the summer.   
      Many walkers and cyclists also   
 use the area.                         
      This area is criss-crossed with  
 footpaths regularly used by local     
 residents.                            
      A bus service runs daily from the
 town of Swanage in the north to       
 Durlston Country Park, but this is the
 only form of public transport. Local  
 taxi firms also carry residents and   
 holidaymakers alike.
