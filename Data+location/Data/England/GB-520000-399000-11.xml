		<title>11A child's Monday</title>
		<content> I got up in the morning watch         
 Breakfast TV and then get dressed. I  
 have my breakfast which is usually    
 toast and peanut butter and cereal and
 a drink of either tea or orange juice.
 I clean my teeth pack my bag and go   
 out to catch the bus. The bus takes me
 to school. We stop several times to   
 pick up children from other villages. 
 I copy my spelling, have maths and    
 then a break. I come in for English   
 and then it is dinner break. I take my
 own lunch which consists of           
 sandwiches, crisps, cake or buscuits. 
 Our headmaster takes us for craft and 
 we make such things as masks, carved  
 wooden objects and papier mache       
 models. We break for 15 minutes and   
 come in for a story. We go hom, play  
 out and come in for tea. We go out    
 again in the summer,then bath, watch  
 TV for a while and go to bed.         </content>
