		<title>18SHIPLEY PARK</title>
		<content> Included in Shipley Park are some of  
 the lodges which  once guarded the    
 entrance to Shipley Hall-Nottingham   
 Lodge, Derby Lodge, Mapperley Lodge   
 and Smalley Lodge.  One lodge may be  
 made into a museum to show the local  
 history of the Shipley estate and what
 life was like for the people.         
 Shipley Hall stood on Shipley Hill but
 owing to coal mining subsidence, it   
 had to be demolished.  The foundations
 have been dug out and the ground floor
 rooms labelled so it looks like a full
 scale plan on the grass.              
 Near the site of the Hall, the Water  
 Tower  has been repaired.  On the     
 ground floor there is a tearoom and   
 from the top there are good views over
 all the park.                         
 Across the lake there is Britannia    
 Park, an area which is being developed
 to attract more visitors.             </content>
