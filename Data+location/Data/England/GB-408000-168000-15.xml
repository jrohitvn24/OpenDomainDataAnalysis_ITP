		<content>  The fairly new Avebury School Parents
 Association organises family discos   
 and fun events not always with the aim
 of fundraising but simply for         
 pleasure. Each year in June sees      
 Avebury Day organised by the local    
 football club. This event was an      
 extravaganza of sideshows, games and  
 competitions, as well as a very       
 successful six a side soccer          
 tournament. A good day out for all the
 family. Much to the chagrin of the    
 populace this event is now mainly a   
 soccer tournament.
