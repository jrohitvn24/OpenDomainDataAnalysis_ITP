		<title>13A DAY IN THE LIFE OF ...</title>
		<content>  I get up at seven thirty and put on  
 my school uniform, a blue check dress 
 in summer or a navy skirt, white shirt
 and jumper if it is winter.           
 For breakfast I usually have toast and
 cereal.                               
  At eight thirty I go outside and wait
 fot the school taxi (which is really a
 minibus) and we arrive at school quite
 early where I play with my friends    
 until the bell rings at nine.         
  First we read and then we go into    
 assembly where one of the teachers    
 talks to us and we sing some hymns.   
  We do maths or english in the morning
 then we have our dinner, I buy a      
 school dinner but some children bring 
 sandwiches, and then we play until    
 school starts again.                  
  In the afternoon we sometimes do     
 something exciting like games. We go  
 home at quarter past three.           </content>
