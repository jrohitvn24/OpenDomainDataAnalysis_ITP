		<content>We asked people how the place has      
changed in the last 20 years.A public  
house,a blacksmith and a school had    
closed.The school had 40 pupils 20     
years ago and closed 3 years ago with  
11 pupils.                             
The butcher used to kill meat on the   
spot.                                  
There are a lot less people than 20    
years ago because there are less       
children now.                          
New things in the village are an art   
and craft shop,a dairy has been made   
into an engineering work and a stone   
mason yard.The village hall has been   
improved.                              
The village used to have a good bus    
service, it doesn't now.               
people dont go to church as much.      
Ellastone now share their vicar with   
another parish. There is less community
life now in the village.               </content>
