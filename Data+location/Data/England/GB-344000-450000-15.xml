 so attracts town and city dwellers to 
 relax and enjoy their free time. There
 are numerous amenities to offer. The  
 most popular for this area are two    
 caravan sites at Bank End, which is   
 situated on the side of the River     
 Cocker estuary. There are l20         
 caravans, which are seasonal - March  
 to November. The estuary offers many  
 sporting activities. These include    
 water-skiing, speedboating,           
 windsurfing,yachting, canoeing and    
 fishing.                              
 The Morecambe Bay Wild Fowlers own all
 the shooting rights on the marsh land.
 Being a rural area bird watchers are a
 regular sight around the estuary,as   
 well as on the surrounding farm land. 
 The habits of Badgers are studied     
 closely in various woods in Cockerham.
