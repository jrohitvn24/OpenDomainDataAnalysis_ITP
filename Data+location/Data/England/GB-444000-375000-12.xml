		<content> Pits in and around Barlborough had    
 very odd names such as 'The Fox and   
 Magpie',at Quarry Dam,and 'The Fat and
 Flour', which got it's name from the  
 fact that it was owned by two         
 gentlemen,namely Mr.Mallinder,the     
 local butcher and Mr.Garfitt,the local
 baker and was situated in the         
 Barlborough Common area.              
 The village was comparatively         
 prosperous during the 19th century,   
 supplying coal to various local       
 industries. In 1873 Barlborough No.1  
 colliery,owned by the Staveley Coal   
 and Iron Company,was sunk;it gave     
 employment to 550 people at its peak  
 and it turned out 200,000 tons.       
 The third one was owned by the Oxcroft
 Company. It was sunk in 1896-1927.    
 Cottom pit was dug in 1848 and        
 Barlborough Colliery was dug in 1872.
