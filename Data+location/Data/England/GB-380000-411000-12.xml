		<title>12 Lower Chesham Hall</title>
		<content> Richard Kay bought Chesham Manor and  
 half the estate in 1709 for Â£480. He  
 built a new house in stone which was  
 better than the existing Tudor style  
 one. Richard's new manor is now a     
 listed building.                      
                                       
 The house, known as Lower Chesham     
 Hall, still has mullioned windows,    
 some of which have the original leaded
 glass in them. The stone on one side  
 is very black because of the smoke    
 from the old mills and factories.     
                                       
 Part of the house is now used as      
 offices but the other part still has  
 people living in it. These people take
 care not to damage the character of   
 the house.
