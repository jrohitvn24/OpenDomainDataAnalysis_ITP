		<title>02MY DAD'S JOB by Jane 11yrs</title>
		<content>                                       
 My dad travels as part of his job.  He
 has been to many different countries  
 and has just returned from an         
 exhibition in China.  He has also     
 visitedIndonesia, Singapore and       
 Hong-Kong.  He was away for 3 weeks.  
 One of his favourite countries is     
 Germany. He does not like the Middle  
 or Far East.                          
 For longer journies he travels by air 
 but often goes by car to Europe.      
 Although he likes travelling abroad he
 is always glad to get back to England 
 It is over 15hrs on the plane from    
 China to England.  Some people think  
 that it's lovely to go to lots of     
 different countries but it is not     
 because when you are working you      
 cannot go sight-seeing.         E
