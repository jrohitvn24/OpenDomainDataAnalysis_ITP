		<title>20A DAY IN MY LIFE N.MARSHALL</title>
		<content>    7.00am thats when my mum comes in  
 singing "Oh what a beautiful morning".
    I drag myself out of bed,get washed
 and go for my breakfast,a drink of    
 coffee and some toast.At 7.30 I put   
 the news on.                          
    8.00am I put my sandwiches on my   
 bike and set off for school.As I cycle
 the 1.5 mile journey I look at the    
 countryside.                          
    School begins at 8.55am and ends at
 3.45pm.P.E is my favourite lesson.    
    As soon as I get home I do my      
 homework and then go out to play in   
 Scarthingwell wood until 7.00pm when  
 I have my tea.                        
    After tea I usually play out again 
 until 9.30pm when I come in for a     
 wash.After I have had a wash I watch  
 television until 10.00pm when I go to 
 bed.
