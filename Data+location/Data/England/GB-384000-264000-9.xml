		<title>09SYCHAMPTON</title>
		<content> Sychampton is built on a gentle       
 slope surrounded by farmland. It has  
 open views. There are 22 houses in    
 the hamlet of Sychampton. All of them 
 are set well back from the narrow,    
 quiet, country lane in large pretty   
 gardens with ponds, flower-beds and   
 streams. The houses were all large and
 looked very expensive because         
 they had big extensions and were well 
 maintained. Most of them are old, some
 of them more than 400 years old but a 
 few are modern. Nearly all of the old 
 ones have been modernised and         
 extended. Many were constructed of red
 brick some of which had been painted  
 over and some where half timbered. The
 houses were all detatched. Some were  
 far away from other houses but others 
 were close together. Nearly all of the
 houses had double garages.
