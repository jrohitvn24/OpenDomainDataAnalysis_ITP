		<title>11ALMHOUSES, LEIGHTON BUZZARD.</title>
		<content> 'Beating the Bounds' is a ceremony    
 which has taken place annually since  
 1683, outside the almshouses in North 
 Street, on Rogation Monday. It        
 complies with the will of a man called
 John Wilkes who lived in Leighton     
 Buzzard in the 17C. He left the       
 almshouses to the parish church of    
 'All Saints' to provide a home for old
 ladies who were widowed or spinsters. 
 The procession leaves 'All Saints'    
 around midday led by a garland bearer 
 who traditionally warded off the smell
 of the environment. Outside the       
 almshoses extracts from the will of   
 Matthew Wilkes, John's grandson are   
 read and traditionally a member of the
 choir stands on their head "in order  
 that he or she may understand and     
 retain the words better." The vicar   
 then hands over 50p to each of the    
 retired residents.                    </content>
