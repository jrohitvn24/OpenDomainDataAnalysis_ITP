		<content> Bearley is situated some 4 1/2 miles  
 NNW of Stratford Upon Avon on the A34.
 The village is mentioned in the       
 original Domesday book but has always 
 been small. It probably began as a    
 result of a clearing in the Forest of 
 Avon on the rock of a saltway. The    
 population in 1881 was 215 but this   
 grew after the end of the second world
 war when RAF camps in the village were
 invaded by squatters. A council estate
 was built to house the people and     
 there are now some two hundred houses 
 in the village. More houses are being 
 built.                                
 The village is set in rich farmland   
 although  now provides a living for   
 very few of the inhabitants. Bearley  
 is made up of three district area each
 represented by its own type of housig.
 The old village consist of 50 or so   
 mostly seventeenth century cottages   </content>
