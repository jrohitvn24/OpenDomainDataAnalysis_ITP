		<title>08ORANGE LODGE DAY</title>
		<content> The Irish protestants from Liverpool  
 travel into Southport by train.A      
 procession forms up at the station and
 they parade toward the sea.There are  
 pipe bands dressed in Highland        
 costume along with a selection of     
 drummers.Each lodge of the Orange     
 order has its own band and very       
 distinctive costume.They carry banners
 showing William of Orange defeating   
 the Catholics at the battle of the    
 Boyne in 1680.Although it is this     
 battle they are supposed to be        
 celebrating,the true meaning of the   
 day is lost to most of the            
 marchers.When the procession reaches  
 its destination the marchers          
 disperse to enjoy themselves.Many of  
 the adults get drunk and cause a      
 considerable nuisance in the town     
 before departing home to Liverpool    
 at night.                             </content>
