		<content> Laindon station has been in existence 
 for much longer than Basildon Station.
 It was built to serve the original    
 village of Laindon. There is a smaller
 ticket office but no shop. There is   
 also a parcels office where people can
 send parcels all over the country by  
 rail. There is a signal box on the    
 platform, constructed of wood in the  
 traditional Essex style. There are    
 three platform, and three lines at    
 Laindon Station. The signal box       
 controls the points that send the     
 train to the correct platform.The     
 Signal Box also controls all the      
 signals both up and down the lines. At
 each end of the paltform there are    
 some boards with numbers 4 8 and 12   
 spaced along the track. These baords  
 tell the driver where to stop if he   
 has 4 8 or 12 carriages on his train.
