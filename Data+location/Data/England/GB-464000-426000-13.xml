		<content> In the nearby village of Carlton there
 is a doctor's surgery which is used by
 most of the village. There are other  
 surgeries in Selby. Selby also has a  
 hospital, The War Memorial although   
 most villagers would use York District
 Hospital. We have a school nurse, Mrs.
 Handley, who gives us tests for       
 hearing and sight and looks through   
 our hair. She helps look after our    
 general health.                       
 Pregnant women would go to York or    
 Goole as neither the village or Selby 
 have adequate facilities. Selby deals 
 with fractures, sprains and small     
 wounds.                               
 Most people in the village go to a    
 dentist in Selby or Goole. A school   
 dentist visits the school regularly to
 check our teeth.
