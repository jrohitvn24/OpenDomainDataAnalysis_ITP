 about 3,000 visits were made          
 throughout the year by the officers of
 that section.Proceedings were         
 instituted on two occasions for       
 selling food not fit for consumption. 
 Legislation preventing the excessive  
 pollution of the air and waterways is 
 also enforced by the local authority.
