		<content> The area now known as West Watford was
 at one time part of the Cassiobury    
 Estate, owned by the Earls of Essex.  
 In 1896 a Quaker bought a part of this
 estate, known as{Harwoods Farm}. At   
 the time of the sale of this land for 
 building, a restrictive covenant was  
 included in the deeds to the effect   
 that no public houses were to be built
 on the estate.                        
                                       
 It is the opinion of some residents of
 the area that this has contributed to 
 the fragmentation of community spirit,
 by removing any centres for meeting   
 and for social activity.
