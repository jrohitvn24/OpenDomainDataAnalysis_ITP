		<content>WE FOUND OUT WHAT JOBS PEOPLE DO.A FEW 
SAID THAT THEY SOLD THINGS LIKE        
FARMING   FOOD OR CAR EQUIPMENT.QUITE  
A LOT OF PEOPLE WORK IN AN OFFICE      
E.G.SECRETARY .A COUPLE OF PEOPLE      
NEEDED TO BE SKILLED FOR THEIR JOB     
E.G.ELECTRICIAN.SOME PEOPLE WORK       
PART-TIME AND A FEW PEOPLE  DO MANUAL  
WORK .SOME SAID THAT IF MORE FACTORES  
WERE BUILT IT WOULD MEAN MORE WORK.IF  
THE GOVERMENT WERE CHANGED AND WE      
MADE PEOPLE WORK LESS HOURS THEN       
UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE COULD WORK THE       
HOURS. WE ASKED SOME PEOPLE IF THEY    
THOUGHT THEIR JOB WOULD BE THE SAME IN 
THE FUTURE .THE MAJORITY SAID YES.MOST 
PEOPLE WORK OUTSIDE THE VILLAGES.THE   
ONES WHO DO WORK INSIDE THE VILLAGES   
ARE MOSTLY FARMING PEOPLE.THE AVERAGE  
COMMUTING DISTANCE IS BETWEEN 10 AND 20
MILES TO SURROUNDING TOWNS.
