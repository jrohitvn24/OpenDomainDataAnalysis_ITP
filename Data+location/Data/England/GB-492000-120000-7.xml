		<title>07THE RAILWAY IN SELHAM</title>
		<content>   In 1857 the{Mid Sussex Railway      
 constructed a line from{Horsham}to    
{Petworth.}The extension to Midhurst   
 was opened on 15th October 1866. The  
 wooden station at {Selham}was         
 constructed in{1872.}The villagers    
 now had direct access to London by    
 rail.                                 
   The {passenger service}to Pulborough
 was closed  on 23rd May 1955.The goods
{service }to Midhurst and Pulborough   
 operated until May 1963 although the  
 goods yard itself had been closed     
 earlier.The line was closed on 12th   
 October 1964.    An interesting       
 feature of{Selham Station}was that    
 passengers and cattle had separate    
 roads to approach the platforms.
