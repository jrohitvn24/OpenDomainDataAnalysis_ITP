		<content>  Our area is bisected by the A303, the
 trunk road that links London and the  
 M3 with the West Country.To the north 
 of this lies Bulford Camp and Bulford 
 Village and to the south the ancient  
 town of Amesbury. In between these two
 residential areas is an area of       
 farmland primarily devoted to the     
 growing of animal foodstuffs and      
 wheat.It is on this farmland that the 
 majority of ancient field systems and 
 burial mounds are found. The north    
 west corner of the area is crossed by 
 the River Avon.The highest point      
 Beacon Hill lies in the West.It is    
 reputed to have been the sight of one 
 of the Beacons announcing the coming  
 of the Spanish Armada and was the     
 sight of a Beacon on the night of the 
 Royal Wedding in July 1981.There is   
 little industry, the main employer    
 being the Armed Forces and Naafi.     </content>
