		<title>11JULIA'S SUNDAY</title>
		<content> Today I got up at 6.00 for a cup of   
 tea and biscuit. I got in the cows    
 ready for milking. I fed the cows and 
 calves, and watched dad milk some of  
 the cows. At 8.00 I put on some bacon,
 eggs and potato. We ate at 9.00.      
 I hung up some washing and then got   
 ready for Sunday School which begins  
 at 11.00.                             
 Back at home I put on my old clothes. 
 After dinner I rode my bike until 3.30
 when I fed the hens.                  
 The washing was got in, then the cows.
 At 4.30 I got ready tea - for 5.00.   
 At 6.00 I put the cows into the yard, 
 then played out of doors with my      
 sister.                               
 I watched T.V. for half an hour before
 supper. I bathed and went to bed at   
 9.00.                                 
 Then there was time to read.
