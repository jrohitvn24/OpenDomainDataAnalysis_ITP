		<title>20A VIEW FROM THE COMPILERS</title>
		<content>   The Project was carried out by the  
 entire first year of the Grove School 
 and pupils of the John Hunt Junior    
 School.Sixth formers advised the      
 younger children with technical       
 problems. A video was made showing the
 pupils at work in the local area.     
   The field work was only one of three
 days taken up by the project, the rest
 of the time was spent in the classroom
 where they prepared and collated      
 information. Each pupil designed and  
 produced a booklet on the Balderton   
 area. This work along with materials  
 developed by the teachers involved    
 made up a Domesday display for other  
 pupils to view.                       
   Throughout the project it was clear 
 that pupils, staff and members of the 
 community were enthusiastic about the 
 nature of the work. We, the organisers
 would like to thank those involved.   </content>
