		<title>16Babysitting Circles</title>
		<content>                                       
 Wombourne is a growing village popular
with  young families. Having  to pay  a
babysitter can be a drain  on income so
several babysitting  circles have  been
formed. There  are sixteen  families in
the  circle to  which I belong. Payment
is made using cardboard tokens-one  per
hour before  midnight and  double rates
after.  Usually "Mums"  do the  sitting
but this is not always the case.       
 On moving to Wombourne  I knew  no-one
so joining  the circle was an excellent
way to  get to know  people as the Mums
and Dads meet socially  once a month on
different evenings: the mums  taking it
in turn to host a  pot-luck supper, the
dads  preferring to meet for a drink at
the pub.                               
 The mums  and dads  do sometimes  meet
together socially---if they can all get
babysitters!                           </content>
