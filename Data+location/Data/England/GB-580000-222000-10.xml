		<title>10FIELD TRIPS FROM SCHOOL</title>
		<content>{*}Throughout my school career at      
 Honywood School I went on lots of     
 field trips connected with either the 
 Humanities or Science Departments.    
 Here is a list.                       
{* YEAR 1-science visit to Chalkney    
{Woods   -day trip to Boulogne         
{  YEAR 2-castles at Framlingham and   
{Orford  -Fingringhoe Wick Nature      
{Reserve -Norwich Cathedral            
{        -Stour Valley to study the    
{village of Nayland                    
{  YEAR 3-Lake District for a week     
{*}In the fourth and fifth years       
 examination classes started so field  
 trips were limited to pupils taking   
 the relevant courses.I once again     
 visited Chalkney Woods and also       
 Pelham Grid for my biology            
 course.There was also a week-end in   
 the Peak District for geography.
