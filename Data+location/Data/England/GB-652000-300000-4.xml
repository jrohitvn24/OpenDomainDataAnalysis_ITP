 The Casualty unit treats up to 120    
 people a day. The most common         
 casualties are falls, sprains,        
 'foreign' bodies and cuts. The average
 operation lasts 1/2 hour. On average  
 30 operations are performed each day. 
 the most common operation is the      
 removal of children,s tonsils. There  
 are no rare operations as these are   
 sent to better equipped hospitals.    
 In Maternity 20-30 babies are born    
 during a week. Two or Three babies are
 put in an incubator or born with an   
 illness. Some are put in incubators   
 because they are premature or look    
 jaundiced.
