		<title>11CHESTERFIELD CANAL</title>
		<content> THE MAIN CARGOES CARRIED WERE COAL,   
 CORN,LEAD,BRICKS AND GENERAL GOODS.THE
 VOLUME OF TRAFFIC WAS GOOD BUT AS WITH
 OTHER CANALS THE COMING OF THE        
 RAILWAYS MEANT A DECLINE IN THE TRADE 
 CARRIED.THE CANAL RAN AT A LOSS AFTER 
 1888 AND THE CLOSURE OF THE NORWOOD   
 TUNNEL(MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY) MEANT    
 THAT THE TRENT WAS CUT OFF FROM THE   
 MAIN SOURCE OF CARGOES.THE LAST       
 COMMERCIAL TRAFFIC TO USE THE CANAL   
 WAS IN 1955.EVEN AT THAT TIME THE     
 COMMERCIAL TRAFFIC WAS HORSE DRAWN    
 WHICH ENABLED THE BANKS OF THE CANAL  
 TO BE MAINTAINED IN GOOD CONDITION.   
 IN THE EARLY PART OF THE 1960'S THE   
 CANAL WHICH HAD TENDED TO BE BLOCKED  
 BY PLANT LIFE WAS CLEARED FOR USE AS A
 WATERWAY BY MEMBERS OF THE RETFORD AND
 WORKSOP BOAT CLUB. SINCE THAT TIME    
 THROUGH THE WORK OF THAT GROUP MORE   
 OF THE CANAL HAS BEEN OPENED.         </content>
