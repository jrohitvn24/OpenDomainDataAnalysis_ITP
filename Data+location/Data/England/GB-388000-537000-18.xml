		<content> We carried out a survey among 10-11   
 year olds to find their favourite     
 pastimes.                             
{  Watch TV                          11

  The favourite TV. programme was The  
 Young Ones. This is about 4 young     
 people who do funny things like hammer
 nails into each others heads and throw
 chairs at each other.                 
                                       
 Electronic games are  small computer  
 games and most of them would fit in   
 your pocket. They are powered by      
 battery and controlled by a button or 
 joystick. Illuminated shapes move     
 about on small screens.               </content>
