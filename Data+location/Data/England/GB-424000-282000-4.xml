		<title>04Meriden-Folk Festival.</title>
		<content> In l985, for the first time,{a Folk   
{Fesival of Music and Dance}was held in
 Meriden.                              
                                       
 Over the course of a weekend in June a
 whole variety of activities took place
 throughout the whole village. This    
 included dance displays, music        
 workshops, a craft fair and numerous  
 singarounds and concerts.             
                                       
 The event brought many visitors into  
 the village and it was such a success 
 that it is hoped to make it an annual 
 event in the future.
