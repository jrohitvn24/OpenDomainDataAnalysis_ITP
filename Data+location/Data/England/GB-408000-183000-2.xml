		<title>02Lydiard Millicent</title>
		<content> The village of Lydiard Millicent is   
 believed to be{Saxon}in origin the    
 name Lydiard probably being derived   
 from the Saxon for boundary. The word 
 Millicent comes from a{Lady Millicent 
 who gained possession of the village  
 after the Norman Conquest .           
 The 15th century{All Saints church    
 built of limestone is in the centre of
 the village and behind it is situated 
 the new{manor}built on the ruins of   
 the original Tudor structure which was
 burnt to the ground in 1880.          
 For many hundreds of years the village
 was a very poor community and only    
 recovered with the coming of the      
{railway}to{Swindon,}the villages      
 prosperty being linked with that of   
 the nearby town. Consequently most of 
 the older houses in the village are   
 fairly small and simple including some
 built in a day on common land .       </content>
