		<content> One hundred and fifty years ago,      
 Bridgnorth was the second busiest     
 inland port in Europe, receiving      
 barges that had travelled the length  
 of the River Severn from Bristol with 
 a wide variety of goods.  Initially,  
 the barges were pulled by             
 'bow-haulers' - noisy, uncouth men who
 terrorised the town with thir bad     
 language and drunkeness when they     
 lodged in Low Town overnight.  Later, 
 with the construction of a proper tow 
 parh, horses were used to pull the    
 barges.  For half a century, the river
 has been silted-up and boats are able 
 to travel on the Severn only as far   
 as Bewdley.  Now, the Severn          
 Navigation Trust is conducting a      
 'Feasability Study' on making the     
 river navigable between Bewdley and   
 Ironbridge, with a series of locks and
 weirs at strategic points.            </content>
