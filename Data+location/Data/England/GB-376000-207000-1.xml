		<title>01The Whitminster Area.</title>
		<content> The area we have surveyed lies about  
 seven miles south-west of the city of 
 Gloucester. The area is basically     
 agricultural, given over mostly to    
 dairy farming with a small amount of  
 arable farming. The small village of  
{Whitminster}lies nearly at the centre 
 of the block. The village dates back  
 to the time of the original Domesday  
 Book.                                 
                                       
 The block has always contained several
 main transport routes up the Severn   
 Valley. Today it contains part of the 
 main A38, part of which follows the   
 route of an old Roman road, the M5,   
 with Junction 13 on the southern      
 boundary of the block and a small     
 section of the Gloucester and         
 Sharpness Canal.                      
                                       
                                       </content>
