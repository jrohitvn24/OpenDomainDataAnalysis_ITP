		<title>14SCHOOL SWIMMING POOL</title>
		<content>                                       
 The school is fortunate enough to have
 its own open air swimming pool        
 measuring 36 feet by 24 feet. It was  
 opened by Mr Jeremy Thorpe who was    
 then M.P. for North Devon.  The pool  
 is surrounded by a high wall and has  
 boys' and girls' changing rooms.  The 
 money for these things was provided by
 the Parent Teacher Association.  In   
 the summer each class tries to use the
 pool every day if the weather allows. 
 It is a facility which provides great 
 enjoyment whilst also giving children 
 an opportunity to learn to swim.      
 Indeed by the time they leave Instow  
 School most of the children are able  
 to swim.
