		<title>19The village shop.</title>
		<content> Built some 100 years ago the cottage  
 was converted to accomodate a shop by 
 J.Arthur Rank, shortly after the war, 
 for one of his war-wounded former     
 employees.                            
 The store has a minor claim to fame   
 through being featured in the film    
 "The Triple Echo".                    
 The Store suffered fluctuations in its
 fortunes according to the attitude of 
 its owners and the general trend      
 toward Supermarket shopping. The      
 present owners took over the          
 business with little goodwill and even
 less stock,and set about the task of  
 changing the acquired habits of the   
 villagers by stocking a range of      
 immediate needs, There are now some   
 2800 different items available.  The  
 success of the venture proves that the
 village shop will always be an        
 essential part of village life.       </content>
