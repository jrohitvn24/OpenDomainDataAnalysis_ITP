1842 ! The foundations for its erection
were not got out until late in the year
1842 or early in 1843.The first        
incumbent was the reverend.R.Goldham , 
who retained the living until 1845.His 
first entry in the burial register was 
that of Sammuel Colcough,November      
27,1842, before the ground was         
consecrated.His first entry in the     
birth register was on October 16 1842  
viz, that of Joseph, son of John and   
Mary Beresford who was probably        
christened at his home.
