		<title>14MULLION PARISH CHURCH</title>
		<content> Mullion Parish Church was largely     
 built between 1200 and 1300AD. At     
 first it was small, but as the number 
 of practising Christians grew, it was 
 extended. Sir Robert Ludra built the  
 bell tower, which houses 6 bells, in  
 the early 16th century. He also       
 commissioned the carving of the sides 
 of the oak benches and the seat rails,
 which depict the instruments of the   
 passion. All the windows have been    
 replaced by modern stained glass.     
 There are usually 5 services each     
 week, 2 of which are on Sundays. The  
 average size of the congregation is   
 between 80 and 90, increasing in the  
 summer due to tourists.The church can 
 hold 200 people.In 1984 there were 6  
 weddings annd 4 funerals.In 1912 the  
 churchyard was officially closed for  
 burials, though in 1985 there still   
 remains space for cremated remains.   </content>
