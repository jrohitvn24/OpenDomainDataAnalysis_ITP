		<content>{A group of children}carried out a     
 survey on housing in the area,        
 concentrating on North Rangeworthy,   
 Bagstone and West End. These are some 
 of the results.                       
{Only a small number of houses}have    
 been built since World War 2. Most of 
 the local houses are quite old. About 
 half of them are over 100 years old.  
{The most common building material}is  
 stone although some of the newer      
 houses and bungalows are built in     
 brick or have rendered walls.         
{Three quarters of the houses}have 6,7 
 or 8 rooms but several have 11 or 12  
 rooms. As for bedrooms, most houses in
 the sample have 3 or 4 bedrooms.      
{The children decided}that they were   
 fortunate with their housing          
 conditions, particularly as most of   
 them also have big gardens.
