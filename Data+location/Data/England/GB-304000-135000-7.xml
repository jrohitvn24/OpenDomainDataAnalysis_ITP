		<title>07Birds Hill - my Walk</title>
		<content>     First we stopped in Monksilver at 
 the Notley Arms.   We walked to the   
 Old School House.   We walked up Birds
 Hill then we stopped at the top of the
 hill and looked down at the view.  We 
 collected samples and took some       
{photographs}and did some{sketching.   
     From its summit you can see that  
 this is one of the{highest points     
 around Monksilver.   We could see that
 Birds Hill is covered with{deciduous  
 trees.                                
     Looking towards{Minehead}you can  
 see the variety of the land cover.    
 Some of the fields are brown and      
 ploughed, others are green with{cereal
{crops or silage}showing this to be an 
 arable farming area .   But this land 
 cover is only predominant in the low  
 valley areas.
