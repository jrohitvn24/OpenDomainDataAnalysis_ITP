		<title>12A DAY IN MY LIFE-BY BEN</title>
		<content> I start the day the same old way.     
 Mum wakes me up and I lie in bed for a
 little bit longer. I have a wash and  
 get dressed. I go down stairs and comb
 my hair which Dad normally reminds me 
 about. I get the Alpen and have my    
 breakfast. I do my teeth and put my   
 shoes on. At 8.45 I am on my way to   
 school. Some times I meet Gavin on my 
 way. When I get to school I play      
 football till the bell rings. We go in
 and do our maths then  go to play and 
 when we come in again we do some      
 English. We normally write a story and
 then we have our dinner. I try and get
 in first so I can get some fish and   
 chips with peas. Then when the bell   
 rings we do topic and have a story to 
 finsh the day. I go home and do my    
 cornet practice then I watch TV till  
 tea time. After tea I watch TV till 9 
 o clock. Then I go to bed.            </content>
