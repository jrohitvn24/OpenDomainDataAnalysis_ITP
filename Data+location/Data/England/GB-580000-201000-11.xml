		<content> There is a camping club which used    
 to be called Purleigh Herd because    
 they used to keep pigs.It is now owned
 by the association of camping.It is   
 now called Purleigh Law.The longest   
 you can camp there is twenty one days.
   We visited Purleigh Church we found 
 that they have a fund for the church. 
 In the local village hall, brownies,  
 guides, cubs and scouts are held.     
   There are village halls at both     
 Purleigh and Cock Clarks where various
 functions are held. Recently there was
 a ceilidh and a street party organised
 at Purleigh. The Women's Institute is 
 also very active.
