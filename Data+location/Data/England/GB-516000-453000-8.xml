		<title>08SKIPSEA SEWAGE STATION</title>
		<content> We went to{Skipsea Sewage Station.    
 We went on to the top of a building.  
 There were lots of germs and we       
 weren't to touch anything. There were 
 some concrete walls with small water  
 alleys and little waterfalls. It      
 didn't smell as much as we thought.   
 There were a pair of big motors       
 which drove around some blades which  
 chopped up the solids.The water was a 
 shade of light grey.The{settlement    
{tanks}looked like dirty swimming      
 pools. In the tanks the sludge and the
 liquid separate. The {filtration beds 
 are round concrete tanks full of      
 stones.They are covered with bacteria,
 millions of tiny creatures which you  
 would need a microscope to see.The    
 bacteria help to purify the water by  
 eating away at the impurities in the  
 sewage.There are four blue metal arms 
 which spray water onto these stones.  </content>
