Keston Fruit Farm has a lower acreage  
put down to fruit trees. There are 35  
acof apples of thirteen different      
varieties and Conference and Comic     
pears. Many apples go to make Cider.   
About 80 acres are down to whaet and   
barley.                                
LANDSCAPE:                             
Considering this area is within the    
London Borough of Bromley it offers a  
surprisingly rural landscape.The land  
use divides broadly into two sections, 
agricultural and woodland.Woods are on 
the higher ground over 100m and on the 
steeper slopes. The agricultural land  
is dominated by   cereal production in 
the east and pastureland in the west.  
Considering the relief of the land     
which is gently undulating and         
relatively steep for cultivation       
the proportion of cereals is high.     </content>
