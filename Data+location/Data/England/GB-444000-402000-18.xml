		<title>18EMPLOYMENT IN THE DEARNE</title>
		<content> The Dearne is a{Coal Mining Area.     
 There were{three pits, Goldthorpe,    
{Highgate and Barnburgh.}Highgate is   
 now closed. The two remaining pits    
 employ 1346 men.                      
 Most of the Coal mined in this area is
 sent to the Power Stations at Thorpe  
 Marsh and Ferrybridge.                
 To help increase employment in the    
 area a new{Industrial Estate}has been 
 build at Highgate Lane, Goldthorpe.   
 The ten factory units have been       
 subsidised by{Barnsley Council.}So far
 half the units are occupied. Among    
 them is English Rose, a clothing firm 
 who employ 320 women.                 
 Some people are employed in the       
 Lowfield Road furniture factory       
 and local shops and the supermarket.  
 However unemployment in the Dearne    
 area is around 20%.
