		<content> The school 60 years ago was very      
 uncomfortable because there was no    
 heating,only a small coke stove.The   
 desks were made of cast iron.The desks
 could be turned into a form.The cane  
 was a punishment.The boys wore short  
 trousers,a cap and a thick woollen    
 jumper.The girls wore a blue dress.   
   Medomsley pits occupied most of the 
 village,employing{1000}miners.There   
 was about{100}men going to and from   
 the {3}shifts starting at 7am.There   
 was a coal steam train going up to    
 Consett every{30}mins.This closed in  
 1963.                                 
  There was a large{Co-Op}where an old 
 people's home is now.There were       
 several shops,a butcher,a joiner,a    
 baker,a draper,a blacksmith and a     
 builder.Roads were dusty limestone not
 tarmac.If there was a wind it would be
 like a sandstorm.                     </content>
