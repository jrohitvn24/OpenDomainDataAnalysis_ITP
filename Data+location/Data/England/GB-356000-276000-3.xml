		<content>      We have found out that{twice}as  
 many people have pets than ones that  
 don't. This is probably because people
 have a lot of room to put them in as  
 Bitterley has a lot of countryside.   
{Dogs are most popular.}This is because
 people like them to guard the house   
 while they are out.Farmers need them  
 to herd sheep.{Cats}are probably the  
 second most popular because they catch
 vermin. Most people have one pet.This 
 might be because people don't like    
 buying too much food.Most people keep 
 pets inside. However,there are outside
 animals. 5{people keep fishes.}They   
 can be inside and outside.Altogether  
 in our block there are:{28 dogs,21    
{cats,10 birds,6 ponies,1 hamster,3    
{rabbits,0 snakes.}The others were 1   
 goat and a gerbil.
