		<title>05MARTLESHAM INDUSTRIAL ESTATE</title>
		<content>When R.A.F.Martlesham finally closed in
l963 many of the forces airfield       
buildings were ideally suited for light
industry and from a small nucleus of   
varied businesses, an industrial estate
of some 70 firms has been established. 
New purpose designed buildings have    
been erected to house a variety of     
light industries whilst the hangars    
have become large capacity warehouses, 
mainly for shipping firms, Felixstowe  
docks being only seven miles to the    
South.                                 
The site is dominated by the giant     
British Telecom research buildings and 
it's tall tower which now stand on the 
former site of the Officer's Mess.     
So Martlesham Heath's fame for         
experimentation lives on.              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
