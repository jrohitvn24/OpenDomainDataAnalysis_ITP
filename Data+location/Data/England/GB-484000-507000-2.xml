   The area lies in and around part of 
 Eskdale, a large valley cut into the  
 Jurrassic limestone and sandstone of  
 the northern end of England's         
 Jurrassic Belt.                       
   The valley floor is flat and very   
 low lying.  It has been extensively   
 glaciated and large deposits of       
 boulder clay have been left on the    
 valley floor and lower slopes by the  
 glaciers.                             
   Part of a small terminal moraine    
 enters the north-western corner of the
 area.                                 
    The higher ground of the area has  
 not been glaciated and the soils are  
 acid and thin.  E.g. Skelder Top.
