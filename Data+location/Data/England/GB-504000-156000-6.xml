		<content> The Ripley Guy Fawkes bonfire attracts
 thousands to its torch lit procession 
 with floats, bonfire Queen, fireworks,
 fancy dress parade and funfair.       
 Visitors contribute to the funds of   
 the over-60's Club, which provides the
 refreshments. Here, as in Pyrford,    
 there is a summer Flower Show with    
 many attractions and both villages    
 hold Harvest Suppers and Christmas    
 Fairs, the Pyrford Fair being on a    
 large scale benefitting Church        
 charities. William of Ockham's 900th  
 anniversary was the Ockham event of   
 1985. (see Special Feature on the     
 Church). Church Flower Festivals are  
 increasingly popular. In Ockham, the  
 New Year is rung in by the Church     
 bellringers and there is a house to   
 house carol singing by Church members 
 in aid of local charities.
