  Raphael's Park is situated between   
 Main Road and Romford Golf Course. It 
 was opened in 1935 and is very popular
 with old people, who can often be seen
 walking their dogs, and the young, who
 play on the fields and tennis courts. 
  Particularly popular with all age    
 groups is the park's beautiful lake   
 with it's wild life and places to     
 fish. During the fishing season, the  
 banks of this gleaming lake are packed
 with keen fishermen out for their     
 daily catch.                          
  Romford Golf Course boarders the     
 Park and is a private Golf Club. It is
 famous for it's great number of       
 bunkers - 365, one for every day of   
 the year.
