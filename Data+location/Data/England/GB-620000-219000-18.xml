 THIS WAS FOUNDED BY A GROUP OF        
 VOLUNTEERS JUST OVER A YEAR AGO. THE  
 TRUST AIMS TO PRESERVE AND IMPROVE THE
 ENVIRONMENT. A RECENT MAJOR PROJECT   
 HAS BEEN THE RESTORATION OF THE OLD   
 LIFEBOAT HOUSE AT WALTON ON THE NAZE. 
 THE SECOND PROJECT  HAS BEEN THE      
 RESTORATION OF THE RAILWAY STATION AT 
 FRINTON. IN RECENT YEARS THE STATION  
 WAITING ROOM HAS BEEN VANDALISED AND  
 LEFT IN A DIRTY STATE. THE TRUST HAS  
 CLEANED IT UP AND REPLACED THE CARPET.
 BRITISH RAIL HAS HAD THE CHAIRS       
 RECOVERED AND THE FLOOR SANDED AND    
 POLISHED.  THE WAITING ROOM IS NOW AS 
 ATTRACTIVE AS IT WAS WHEN QUEEN MARY  
 SAW IT IN THE 1930'S. THE MOST RECENT 
 PROJECT IS THE CLEANING UP OF THE     
 SIGNALMAN'S COTTAGE GARDEN AT FRINTON 
 STATION. TENDRING HIGH SCHOOL CHILDREN
 HAVE MADE A START ON THIS JOB.        </content>
