		<title>05Callow Wood-Lydden</title>
		<content>The trees in Callow Wood were          
predominantly hazels,mixed with        
ash,elder and some oaks.The floor of   
the wood was carpeted with dog's       
mercury and beneath this layer         
primroses and bluebells could be seen. 
These were beginning to die back.The   
wooded track suddenly opened out onto  
a cleared area covered in chalk rubble 
containing a derelict car.Very few     
plants grew on the chalk but there     
were many growing around the edges of  
the clearing.These included            
buttercups,speedwells,forget-me-nots,  
scarlet pimpernels,agrimony,willow     
herb,woody nightshade and hemlock,all  
in flower.Other plants included        
creeping cinquefoil,which was beginning
to colonise the chalky area,thistles,  
burdock and stinging nettles.          
Among the chalk boulders we found ants,
centipedes,woodlice,snails and slugs.  </content>
