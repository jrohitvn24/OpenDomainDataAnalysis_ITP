		<title>07Rousham House and Village</title>
		<content> Rousham House was built about 1600 but
 extended in 1737 by William Kent who  
 also laid out the gardens. They are   
 the only surviving example of a Kent  
 garden design, and the owner, Mr      
 Cottrell-Dormer is doing his best to  
 make sure that they are preserved for 
 the future.                           
 The village, outside the gates, was   
 built about 1770 when the park was    
 enclosed. It has mains electricity but
 not mains drainage or natural gas. Now
 very few of the inhabitants work on   
 the estate. The school has closed down
 because there are only six children in
 the village, and they have to go to   
 Steeple Aston (five miles away) until 
 they are eleven, and then to Bloxham. 
 There are only services in the church 
 (built in 1500) on the first Sunday in
 the month, as there is no resident    
 clergyman.                            </content>
