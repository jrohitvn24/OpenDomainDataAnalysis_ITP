		<title>06OBJECTIONS TO LANDFILL</title>
		<content> I don't think the welbeck scheme      
 should go ahead. I used to live in    
 Queensway so I know what it's like.The
 pit trucks make beeps when they       
 reverse and you can distinctly hear   
 them from a mile away-maybe less.Then 
 new road that they propose to build   
 will cause a lot of stress for people 
 who live nearby.                      
 (Many letters and petitions  have been
 (submitted in protest against the     
 (scheme by the residents of Heath,    
 (Kirkthorpe,Stanley Ferry and         
 (Goosehill.)                          
 Controversal issues include noise,    
 smoke,dust,smells ect.                
 (The landfill will take many decades  
 (to complete.The final say on the way 
 (forward at Welbeck rests with the    
 (Enviroment Secretary,Mr Patrick      
 (Jenkin.Future generations would      
 (benefit if the scheme went ahead.)   </content>
