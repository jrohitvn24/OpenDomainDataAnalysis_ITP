		<title>09FARMING</title>
		<content> The public as a whole, contary to     
 previous views, seems to get on very  
 well with the farmers and it seems to 
 be a very co_operative area.A sore    
 topic with some people is farm smells 
 but most people have got used to them.
                                       
 As the size of farms has got larger   
 there are now many old farm houses    
 which have been taken over by new     
 people moving into the area. This has 
 meant that an increasing number of    
 people are now less familiar with the 
 farming way of life.                  
                                       
  One difficulty between the public and
 the farmers is the problem of large   
 farm machinery on the very narrow     
 lanes. This often seemed to be a cause
 of irritation to the local non_farming
 residents.
