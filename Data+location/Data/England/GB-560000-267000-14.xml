		<title>14The Chalk Pit, Burwell</title>
		<content> This lake is privately owned by       
{"Mitcham B.C. Farms Limited".}It      
 covers an area of over one acre. It   
 used to be a chalk pit serving a      
 cement works and the railway line ran 
 past it. The last of the chimneys was 
 pulled down in the 1940's. The lake   
 now provides a home for lots of birds,
 insects, fish, plants and trees.      
 These birds were among those seen:    
 Great Crested Grebe, Kingfisher,      
 Treecreeper and Turtle Dove, along    
 with a range of butterflies, dragon   
 flies, black tailed skimmers, blue    
 damsel flies and bees. The plants seen
 included: Wayfaring Tree, Mallow, Old 
 Man's Beard, White Briony, Poppy,     
 Campion, Bulrush, Sedge, Reed, Dog    
 Daisy, Cow Parsley, Forget-me-not and 
 Ash, Elder, Sycamore and Willow trees 
 which can all survive where the soil  
 is wet.                               </content>
