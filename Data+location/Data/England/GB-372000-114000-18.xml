 arable field occupying about a quarter
 of the square.The land carries milking
 and breeding Friesian cattle,also pigs
 The pasture is cropped for silage and 
 hay.A few horses are kept on pasture. 
 The old field footpaths seem generally
 disused.A population of about fourteen
 includes four retired people and two  
 children.The rest are mainly concerned
 with agriculture.On the NW-SE road are
 five dwelling-houses with gardens.    
 A big farmhouse is reached by a lane  
 which runs from the north-south road. 
 The area has excellent local transport
 making approximately thirty outward   
 journeys weekly.                      
 A disused line of the old Somerset and
 Dorset Railway runs under Kings Mill  
 Bridge to the north-east of the area  
 and,in parts,is a refuge for          
 wild-life.                            </content>
