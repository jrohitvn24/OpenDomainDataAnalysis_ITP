          _________________            
     This chapel was built in 1899.    
 Like the Parish Church, it has many   
 plaques such as the following:-       
     In Memory of Mrs. Ward's late     
 husband Mr. Samual Ward.              
     In Memory of Mrs. G. Sadler from  
 Petton.                               
     The actual chapel is made up of   
 two buildings,one of which is probably
 for Sunday School and meetings.This   
 chapel also has a large variety of    
 graves ranging from 1862-1983.        
    The disused chapel (Enon Chapel.)  
     Enon Chapel is an old building    
 constructed in 1899.Outside on the    
 wall is a plaque:- 1899,Enon Chapel   
 "This is the lords doing,it is        
 marvellous in our eyes."This chapel is
 now disused and contains a magnificant
 pedal organ made by Crane &amp; Sons Ltd. </content>
