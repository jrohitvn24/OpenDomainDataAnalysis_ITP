		<title>10A Public House-Dorking NE</title>
		<content> The Arkle Manor is more than a public 
 house.It is really a{steak restaurant.
 It is on the{A25 road to Reigate}and  
 passing tourists,including foreigners 
 from{Gatwick Airport}come in for      
 meals.The main trade is from regular  
 customers who come from some distance 
 because{they like the atmosphere.     
  The staff we talked to were very     
 friendly.There were jockey silks and  
 pictures of famous horses and riders  
 that made the place welcoming.        
   About{300 meals}are served every    
 week in the steak house and{400 meals 
 in the bar.Times when they are        
 exceptionally busy are;Christmas,     
 Easter and New Year, and at summer    
 weekends.                             
   We were told that the breweries were
 putting up the price of beer too often
 at the moment.{A pint of bitter costs 
{Â£0.90}in the bar.                     </content>
