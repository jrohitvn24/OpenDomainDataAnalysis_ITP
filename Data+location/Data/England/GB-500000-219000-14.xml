		<content> We carried out the survey on two days.
 The first day was a dry Sunday and the
 second was a rainy Monday.            
   There were 90 cars there on the     
 Sunday and only 17 cars on the Monday.
   People were watching hand gliding,  
 walking the dog or having a picnic.   
 Most came from 30 to 40 km away.      
 Nearly all came by car. The  average  
 amount of people in a party was two.  
 On the Monday the average time spent  
 there was one to two hours. On Sunday 
 it was more. Up there, there are two  
 car parks and a small ecological      
 museum.
