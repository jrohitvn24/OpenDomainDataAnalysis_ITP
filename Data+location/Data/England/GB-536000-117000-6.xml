		<title>06St Peters Church Chailey</title>
		<content> St Peters Church is very old, it has  
 chancel which was built around 1250   
 and the tower was built in 1280.      
 During the nineteenth century there   
 was a north aisle added and alter, in 
 the same century another was built The
 ancient parts of the building are     
 constructed of sandstone.There are six
 bells, five of them date from 1737 and
 the sixth was added in 1810.  The     
 Rector is the Rev Eddie Mathias and he
 has been Rector for 20 years. He      
 visits the school every weekend       
 presents the team points cup. He looks
 after the vilalge minibus and s the   
 Chairman of the School Governors.     
 Every year in June a special service  
 is held and many children attend. Rev 
 Mathias never stands in the pulpit    
 because he likes to talk to the       
 congregation in a natural and easy    
 manner.                               </content>
