		<title>10         FARMING</title>
		<content>    Long Sutton is an agricultural area
 which has lots of deep rich soil. The 
 fields which are all flat have dykes  
 surrounding them to drain the water   
 away. There are no hedges and few     
 trees. The land is always being worked
 and there are many allotments and     
 glasshouses. There is not much        
 livestock, but there is a wide range  
 of crops. Some of the food crops are  
 wheat, barley, potatoes and sugar     
 beet. There are some new crops in Long
 Sutton like oil seed rape and roses.  
 Soft fruit is grown in Long Sutton to 
 be sold to either the fresh market or 
 the canning factory. We grow daffodils
 and tulips in Long Sutton for the     
 flowers and the bulbs. We grow salad  
 crops, both under glass and in the    
 open.
