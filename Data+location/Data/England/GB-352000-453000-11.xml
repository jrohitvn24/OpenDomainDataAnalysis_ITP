		<title>11CHRIST CHURCH,OVER WYRESDALE</title>
		<content>    There is evidence of a chapel here 
 in 1370 supported by John o'Gaunt.    
 The stipend of Â£4 which he decreed    
 should be paid to the Chaplain is     
 still paid by the Queen to the present
 incumbent. The church was rebuilt in  
 1733. It lies about a kilometre west  
 of Abbeystead itself and is a focus of
 footpaths leading from the surrounding
 farms.It has been named the Shepherds'
 Church and a bar with hooks on which  
 shepherds may hang their crooks is    
 found in the porch. All the stained   
 glass windows, each given in memory of
 a member of the Molyneux family depict
 a scene with sheep. Philip Molyneux,  
 4th Earl of Sefton was responsible for
 the last major restoration in 1894 but
 a new heating system was installed in 
 1985. A 'Breeches' Bible (16th century
 Geneva Bible) is kept in the church.
