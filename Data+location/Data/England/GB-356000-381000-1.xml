		<title>01A day in my life</title>
		<content>{I wake up usually at 7.30am. I get    
{up, get dressed, open all curtains in 
{the house and wake up my mum, dad and 
{my sister. While they're getting      
{dressed I make my bed and put the     
{kettle on. I have my breakfast of     
{cornflakes. I take my dog for a walk  
{and then do the dishes. At halfpast   
{eight we set off in a Morris Marina   
{car for school. At school, I meet my  
{friends. We talk usually about the    
{things on T.V. last night. When the   
{bell goes at 9.00am we go to our      
{classes and after registers           
{and reading we usually do Maths, then 
{after maths we go out to play. We     
{usually talk and walk round the field.
{When the bell goes we go in and do    
{English until dinner. In the afternoon
{we have lessons until 3.30pm. At home 
{after tea I watch T.V. and go to bed  
{at 9.00. }                            </content>
