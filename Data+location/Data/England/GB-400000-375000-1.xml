		<title>01GENERAL SURVEY OF AREA</title>
		<content>   This area is part of the Peak       
 District National Park. Here is       
 found high moorland, river and valley 
 scenery, with the man-made addition   
 of the twin reservoirs of Fernilee and
 Errwood.                              
   The character of the area has       
 changed considerably over the years.  
 Before the reservoirs were built, a   
 thriving farming community and railway
 existed. Now most forms of human      
 habitation have vanished, leaving an  
 area that is visited by thousands of  
 people every year but which           
 paradoxically remains sparsely        
 inhabited.                            
   The popularity of this area is due  
 partly to it being within easy access 
 of many neighbouring cities.
