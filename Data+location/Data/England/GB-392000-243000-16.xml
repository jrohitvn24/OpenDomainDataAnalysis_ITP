 The{Pershore Horticultural College}has
 a reputation for experimentation in   
 the growth and development of fruit   
 and vegetables.                       
{Hydroponics,}the growing of plants in 
 water with nutrients added, has been  
 pioneered at the College and many     
 countries of the World have been      
 interested in the advances made in    
 this field.                           
 Experimentation in hybrid plant       
 production, virus elimination and     
 tissue culture are pursued at the     
 College.                              
 Many firms are introducing the new    
{computer technology}to help with their
 records and accounting and the farmers
 of the area are among the most        
 technologically advanced in Europe
