		<content> On investigation there seems very     
 little illness in the valley, and few 
 accidents on the narrow lanes. There  
 are no main water pipes in the area   
 but springs and wells, man made tarns 
 and fast flowing revers provide       
 enough. Many homes have private wells.
 Again no main sewer, but sceptic tanks
 and cess pits which are regularly     
 inspected by the local council. None  
 in the area but several on the        
 perimeter, good general hospitals in  
 easy reach, an excellent ambulance    
 service and health centres at Bowness 
 and Kendal. Midwives and district     
 nurses visit anyone needing them, and 
 home helps.
