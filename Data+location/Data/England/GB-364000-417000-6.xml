		<content> Sheep predominate on this rough       
 pasture land, and are of three types: 
 Swaledale Lonks and Derbyshire        
 Gritstone, well-adapted to the        
 often damp bleak winter weather on the
 high moorlands.  They belong to       
 the black-faced horned group of hill  
 sheep.  There are also North Country  
 Cheviots, similarly suited to this    
 environment.  The cattle are Welsh    
 Blacks, also capable of surviving on  
 marginal lands with sparse grass,     
 together with Aberdeen Angus and      
 Black Herefords.  All animals are     
 supplementarily fed by the farmers in 
 winter-time when snow can lie on the  
 fields for maybe weeks at a time.     
 Domestic fowls and geese are kept at  
 Higher Pasture House together with    
 some goats.
