		<title>18Views on the Moor.</title>
		<content>    The moor is a wild lonly place. One
 can walk all day and not see another  
 soul. To some this is how it should   
 be. However, with the greater leisure 
 now available to the population it    
 would seem to me to be a crime if the 
 moor were to be put out of bounds to  
 many people.                          
    I love the wild places, alone with 
 the wind and the song of the birds. I 
 is also nice to meet another human,   
 pass the time of day, then walk on    
 free of the cares and worries of the  
 increasingly frenetic world.          
    The world would be a duller place  
 without the wild places. Although the 
 moor has been changed by man, it seems
 that it remains unchanging. To all    
 those who would stop people waling the
 moor, to all those who would ruin it  
 with roads and resevoirs, I say, hands
 off. Leave it to the wild.            </content>
