		<title>11AMBULANCE SERVICE:ATTITUDES.</title>
		<content> We interviewed 20 people in our block.
 Most of these people were women,      
 presumably because the men were out   
 working.When we asked them what they  
 thought of the ambulance service, most
 people thought they were adequately   
 served, but some said the service was 
 disgraceful. Several of the older     
 people we interviewed said they were  
 sometimes worried that the ambulance  
 would not get to them in time.When we 
 asked them how long they thought it   
 would take the ambulance to get to    
 them from Alnwick, which is 3 miles   
 away, the answers ranged from 7 to 30 
 minutes.We contacted the ambulance    
 station at Alnwick and asked how long 
 it would take to get to Lesbury, they 
 said it would take about 7 minutes    
 after receiving the call.
