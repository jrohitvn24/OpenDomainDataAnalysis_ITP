		<title>09A WINNING TRADITION</title>
		<content> During recent years South Moor has    
 followed the tradition of success     
 first established in 1899 by Miles    
 Handy when he became World Champion   
 "Handball"or"Durham Fives"player.     
 In April 1985 South Moor Modernaires  
 Jazz Band came 2nd in the U.K.Finals  
 and qualified for the World           
 Championships.Other pursuits such as  
 scrambling,flying model planes and    
 snooker have also won awards.More     
 traditional pursuits like bowls,golf, 
 pigeon racing and cricket are also    
 successful.Many of the young people   
 attend Brownies,Guides,Boy's Brigade  
 and Youth Clubs while the women of the
 village carry on the fine traditions  
 of the W.I.and Mothers'Union.         
 The success of these varied activities
 reflects the enthusiasm and           
 competitive spirit of the local       
 residents.                            </content>
