		<title>03Knowsly Cross House, Longnor</title>
		<content>     Knowsly Cross House was, I        
believe, built in the late eighteenth  
century and was a thatched house in    
those days.                            
                                       
     The house is situated on the road 
from Longnor to Sheen.  The River Dove 
runs in the valley to one side and the 
River Manifold just to the other side. 
                                       
     Knowsly Cross was situated in the 
garden and was restored in the year    
1897 by the then owner Mr. Mark Taylor 
who came from Yorkshire.  I believe the
cross dates back to the Danish invasion
in the ninth century.                  
                                       
     There are wide views over the     
Derbyshire hills to the east and over  
the Staffordshire Moorlands to the     
south.                                 
                                       </content>
