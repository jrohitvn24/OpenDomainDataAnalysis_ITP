		<title>08 PARSONS GREEN COMMON</title>
		<content>The Common is roughly triangular in    
shape with several walk-ways           
criss-cross, so that people walk across
the Green rather than follow the       
footpaths that skirt it. Local people  
walk almost every type of dog there,   
local workers crowd onto it during     
their lunch breaks on summer days to   
eat cut lunches, to sunbathe or merely 
to sit and doze on the                 
seats.Surrounding the park there are a 
number of attractive large houses,one  
block of two storey flats,a large      
church of England school set in        
attractive gardens next to a social    
services unit.There is a very popular  
pub with a large patio;on summer       
evening the patio and pavements are    
crowded with young people who gather to
chat and enjoy the social atmosphere.
