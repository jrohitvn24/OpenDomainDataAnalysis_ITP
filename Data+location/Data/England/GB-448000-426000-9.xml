  Girls may join Brownies or Guides in 
 the nearby village of Monk Fryston.   
 Boys can attend Cubs or Scouts in     
 Brotherton or South Milford. Meetings 
 are held once a week, but sometimes   
 special camps are arranged.           
            CUB CAMP by Andrew         
  On Friday June 7 our cub pack went to
 Snowball Plantation near York. We     
 helped the grown-ups put the tents up,
 then the whistle blew for assembly.   
 That night we kept sneaking out of our
 tent and talking to Simon and Nicky.  
 The next morning we played football   
 before our breakfast of toast and     
 cornflakes. We made a space-ship and  
 came first in a competition for all   
 the different packs. That night we    
 sang songs and told stories around the
 camp-fire. The next day we went home.
