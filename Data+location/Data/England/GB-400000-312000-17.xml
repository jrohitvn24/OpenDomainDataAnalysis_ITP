		<title>17HEDNESFORD HILLS RACEWAY</title>
		<content>  On the top of{Hednesford Hills},on   
the site of an abandoned reservoir, is 
a racetrack for{hot-rods, stock cars   
and bangers}. The track forms a figure 
of eight, which makes the race very    
exciting as the cars often crash into  
each other. As they go speeding round  
the track the gravel shoots up and goes
everywhere. The crashes are the best   
part but a speeding hot-rod is also    
exciting. A hot rod may cost up to     
10,000 pounds to build.                
  There are races for children from    
10  years old and all the family can   
watch from stepped banks or in a seated
stadium. Around 30 race meetings a year
are held, usually on{Sundays or Bank   
Holidays}.This year the national       
championips are to be held at the      
raceway.
