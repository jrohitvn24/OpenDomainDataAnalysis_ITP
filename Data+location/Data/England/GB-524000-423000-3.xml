		<content> Keyingham is the larger of the two    
 villages having a population of 2250  
 and is still expanding, although      
 building is restricted by local       
 authority planning groups. New        
 development is usually groups of      
 houses three bedroomed semidetached   
 with a garage and central heating     
 costing around Â£25,000. Most of the   
 families occupying these houses travel
 to Hull the nearest city to work, only
 a very small percentage of the        
 residents of Keyingham and Ottringham 
 actually work in or around the        
 villages. There is a small estate of  
 council houses, these are owned and   
 maintained by the local council and   
 can be rented. Ottringham with a      
 population of 450 has no private      
 'estate' development, the land        
 available for housing is individual   
 plots. There is also a small council  </content>
