		<title>14A Visitor's view,Bridlington</title>
		<content>    My name is Alexander Prosser.      
 My father works in Bridlington School 
 as a computer studies teacher.        
 I don't know all of Bridlington, as we
 live in Warter, but I know the sea    
 front area a bit.                     
 The{beach}is wide and curved into a   
 semi-circle; thousands of tourists    
 visit it each year.                   
{Prince Street}has medium sized        
 illuminations and opens onto the beach
 and harbour.                          
 The{harbour}houses Bridlington's      
 fishing fleet and several private     
 boats.                                
 Near the Spa theatre is the{lifeboat  
{station,}it is away from the beach and
 the lifeboat is launched from a       
 trolley. The trolley is towed to the  
 beach by a special tractor which can  
 go right into the water.
