 Regrettably the time-tabling of buses 
 does not encourage people to use the  
 service to travel to &amp; from work. The 
 service is largely used by            
 shoppers.However there was a consensus
 that the bus service was adequate.    
{MOBILE LIBRARY.}                      
 This only visits the village once a   
 month - a declining service.

 A service much appreciated by young   
 mothers.                              
{MEALS ON WHEELS.}
