		<title>10LOCAL HISTORY - BARKING</title>
		<content>First mentioned in an Anglo Saxon      
Charter of 966, when and Ealdorman of  
Essex granted the parish to the Abbey  
of Ely.  It remained as a food farm    
providing 2 weeks food a year for the  
Abbey until the time of Queen          
Elizabeth.  The Crown sold it to Sir   
Francis Needham.  It later passed to   
the Theobald family, then the Crowley  
family who were wealthy ironmasters,   
then by marriage it went to the Earls  
of Ashburnham in Sussex who held it    
1920.  The old manor house was rebuilt 
by the Ashburnhams and called Barking  
Hall.  This was demolished in 1926     
except for the stable block, which is  
used today, having been converted to a 
private house.  Barking is noted for   
its ancient woodlands.  The Church of  
St. Mary is in the early English style.
One of its Rectors was Robert Uvedale  
the botanist.                          </content>
