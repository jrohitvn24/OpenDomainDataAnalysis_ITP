		<content> We interviewed 10 elderly people about
 their early lives, compared with the  
 present.                              
 WORK-Some people were working when    
 they were very young because the      
 family was hard up. Many worked much  
 longer, harder hours than today for   
 Â£120 per year! Unlike now, there were 
 plenty of jobs to go round, of similar
 type as today.                        
 LEISURE-there was less organised      
 entertainment than today. People      
 entertained themselves, by going for  
 walks. Girls played hop-scotch,       
 netball, hockey and skipping games.   
 Women and girls would knit and sew.   
 Boys played cricket, football, rugby  
 and tennis.Today all of these are     
 still available, but also the cadet   
 forces, outdoor persuits courses and  
 school-organised activities are freely
 available. Today there are more films </content>
