		<title>08Ecology in Alresford</title>
		<content> The land in and around Alresford is   
 well supplied with footpaths and areas
 where people can just sit and enjoy   
 the scenery.  The villagers are       
 helpful and keen when it comes to     
 maintaining and developing public     
 rights of way and nature facilities.  
  Pollution comes in various forms,    
 the carbon monoxide from exhaust      
 fumes is on the increase as there is a
 greater number of cars around.        
 Another problem is the sand and gravel
 lorries which drive past the orchards 
 and leave a fine layer of dust on the 
 crop of apples.
