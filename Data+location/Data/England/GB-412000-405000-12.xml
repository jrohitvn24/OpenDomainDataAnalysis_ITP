		<content> In our area there is a big dairy farm 
 which makes{cream,cottage cheese and  
{yoghurt.}They started making cottage  
 cheese and yoghurt fifteen years ago, 
 but they have been making cream for   
 thirty-five years.There are eighty    
 acres of land and the building itself 
 covers four or five acres.They have   
 one hundred and ten workers at the    
 farm.They buy milk from two hundred   
 farmers and their cream goes all over 
 the world.To make cottage cheese they 
 put four and a half thousand gallons  
 of milk into a vat,they add a starter 
 and it turns the milk into cheese.They
 leave it in the vat for twelve hours  
 and it goes solid.They have warm water
 running round the sides of the vat to 
 cook it.They wash it in cold water and
 then it gets dried.After drying single
 cream and salt are added before being 
 packed in plastic cartons.            </content>
