		<title>01TATTERSHALL AND CONINGSBY</title>
		<content> Our area consists of mainly           
 countryside.We have two villages      
 Coningsby and Tattershall separated by
 the River Bain which flows into the   
 River Witham at Dogdyke.              
 There is an Anglican church in each   
 village.                              
 We have a lot of farmland and quite a 
 few estates.There are four schools,   
 Coningsby Junior,Clinton Park County  
 Primary,Curzon Junior and Gartree     
 which is a secondary modern           
 school.Children from the junior       
 schools go here or to Queen Elizabeth 
 Grammar School in Horncastle at the   
 age of 11.                            
 Tattershall castle is right near the  
 church.                               
 In Coningsby Church there is the      
 largest single handed clock in Europe.
 There is also an R.A.F. strike command
 airfield in Coningsby flying Tornados.</content>
