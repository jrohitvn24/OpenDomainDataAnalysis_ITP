		<content> Reputed to have been in the area for  
 200 years. One family has bought a    
 narrow strip of land called a "slang" 
 &amp; have erected a pre-fabricated bung- 
 alow. They have electricity &amp; water.  
 Another family live on a roadside     
 verge in touring-type caravans &amp; claim
 to be true Romany family. The children
 go to school in Brailsford. The men   
 are scrap metal dealers or work in    
 industry. An old grandmother, now in  
 her 80's, whho still smokes a pipe,   
 lives in council property in Brails-  
 ford.The women no longer make pegs to 
 peddle.These people live alongside    
 local residents, &amp; each have respect  
 for the other,with few exceptios. The 
 neighbouring farmers do not like the  
 debris from the scrap metal lying     
 about. They dont like their fields    
 being used as lavatory and hedges and 
 fences are damaged.                   </content>
