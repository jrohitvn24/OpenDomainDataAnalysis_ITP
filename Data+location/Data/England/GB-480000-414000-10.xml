		<content> Eastoft at one time was split         
 by the River Don,the North side in    
 Yorkshire and the South in            
 Lincolnshire.8 years ago boundary     
 changes meant Eastoft became part of  
 South Humberside.                     
    23 years ago the old church school 
 was replaced;there were only 22 pupils
 on roll.                              
   Five years ago,the Church Institute 
 was modernised to become the Eastoft  
 Village Hall.                         
  Eastoft no longer has a resident     
 vicar;the vicarage being occupied by  
 the Bradwell family.Now the villages  
 of Swinefleet,Whitgift,Adlingfleet and
 Eastoft are known as the Marshland    
 Group of Parishes and share one       
 vicar,who lives at Whitgift.          
   The principal work of the village is
 farming ,the larger farmers being     
 Messrs Godfrey,Coulman,Halkon,Bramhill</content>
