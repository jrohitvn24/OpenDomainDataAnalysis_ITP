 drills for sowing the different types 
 of crops.4-5 sprayers and fertiliser  
 distributors used for putting on the  
 plant food and for protection from    
 diseases.They use 6 Combine Harvesters

 (Wheat,barley).Also they use 3 pea    
 podders for harvesting the peas and   
 beans,2 potato harvesters for lifting 
 the potatoes,2 beet harvesters for    
 lifting the sugarbeet and many        
 trailers to cart the produce from the
