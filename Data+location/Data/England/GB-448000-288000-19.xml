 A small spinney adjacent to the       
 school was bequeathed this year to the
 school by Mr. Sykes, formerly of the  
 Homestead. The Spinney which is in    
 Trust for the school is to be used by 
 the children as a nature area. Mrs.   
 Wood, the headteacher, hopes to have  
 the trees labelled, more wild flowers 
 planted, and nest boxes put into      
 trees. Leicestershire's Environmental 
 Education Advisor has already         
 visited the school to view the site.  
 The Forestry Commission will also be  
 involved in helping to create and     
 conserve this area for the pleasure of
 future generations.                   
 Work has just begun this summer 1985.
