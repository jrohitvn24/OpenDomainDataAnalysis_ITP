		<content>   Yarkhill church was probably built  
 in the 12th C.                        
   The churchwardens staves were       
 presented in memory of Willam Thomas  
 Barnes 1938-1982 by his family and    
 friends.                              
   The organ was presented in memory of
 Alice Hollings 1898-1973 organist for 
 52 years.                             
   There is only one bell in use but   
 the tower holds 4 bells.              
   The Gargoyles are shaped into lions.
 There are stone carvings of kings,    
 queens,knights and ladies.            
   The oldest gravestone we could read 
 was from 1732.                        
   Near the church is a square moat,   
 which is overgrown.                   
   Yarkhill Court Farm is a mixture of 
 red brick and black and white timbered
 buildings.In the nearby field is a cow
 shed with chimneys on either end.     </content>
