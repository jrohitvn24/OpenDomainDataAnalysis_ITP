		<content>The block has within its boundaries a  
small country park area under the title
Sidings Lane Picnic Area.              
   The park is under the control of St.
Helens Borough Council. The park has   
its own Ranger who is responsible for  
the care and protection of the land and
facilities.                            
   The area is primarily woodland      
taking in Kenyon's Wood. There are     
plenty of short paths which lead into  
large open patches of grassland. Spread
around are benches and tables suitable 
for picnics. All throughout the area   
are parking spots in order to provide  
easy access. The spot is also popular  
with local fishermen as the park has a 
well stocked pond.
