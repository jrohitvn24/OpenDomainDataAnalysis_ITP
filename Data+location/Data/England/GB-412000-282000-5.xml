		<content>The Swan Market's aim is to join people
together so they won't have to buy a   
big shop on the High Street. They pay  
lower rents and no rates. The Swan     
Market took 8 weeks to build from just 
a shell.It used to be called Key       
Markets. It cost 38000 pounds in adver-
tising before it was opened by Larry   
Grayson on Nov. 8th 1984. The Market   
covers an area of 40000 square feet.It 
has 166 units to rent for between 24 &amp; 
46 pounds a week.Better units such as  
corners or near entrances cost most.   
75000 people a week visit the market.  
500 people a day use the cafe.150      
people work at stalls varying from     
butchers to winemaking. A special bus  
brings 1800 people a week. 800 child-  
ren a week use the creche which cont-  
ains toys worth 8000 pounds.1000 pounds
a week is spent in advertising and     
promotions.                            </content>
