		<title>11BRAFFORDS PIG FARM.</title>
		<content>  The owner keeps two thousand pigs.   
 They are large white Landrace  pigs.  
 They are supplied at about nine to ten
 weeks old. They stay at Brafford's    
 Hall for nearly fourteen weeks. At    
 twenty four weeks they weigh about one
 hundred kilos and they are fattened   
 for bacon. The pigs are fed on a      
 highly concentrated mixture of waste (
 fish, pastry potatoes, biscuits       
 ,sweets, jelly babies etc.) from      
 factories. The pigs are kept in a     
 controlled environment which draws out
 stale air and puts in fresh air. The  
 pigs are not slaughtered at Brafford's
 Hall. Instead they are sent to a      
 public slaughter house, where they are
 beheaded. Looking after them is a full
 time job.
