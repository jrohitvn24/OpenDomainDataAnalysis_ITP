   Local village names are mainly      
{Anglo-Saxon in origin,}and Bayford was
 'Begesford.' It means 'Beah's Ford.'  
 L'Berkhamsted was 'Beorhamstede,'     
 meaning 'Homestead on the hill.'      
   Both Parishes were named in the     
{Domesday Survey,}1086. William I held 
 Bayford in Hertford Hundred, King     
 Edward held it at his death.          
{Present  }
