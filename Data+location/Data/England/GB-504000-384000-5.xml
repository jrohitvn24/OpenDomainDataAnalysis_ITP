		<content>   Faldingworth is a mixed County      
 Primary School admitting children aged
 5 to 11.                              
   The school serves the parishes of   
 Faldingworth, Buslingthorpe, Wickenby,
 Lissington, Snelland, Friesthorpe,    
 Snarford and Toft Newton (which       
 includes Virginia Estate). Two coaches
 are provided by the County Council to 
 transport children from the outlying  
 villages.                             
   Since the Easter of 1981 children   
 who have stayed at the school at      
 dinner time have had to bring their   
 own packed lunches as the provision of
 school dinners was discontinued.      
   In September 1985 there were 96     
 children on roll divided into four    
 classes according to age.             
   At the age of 11 most children      
 transfer to De Aston Comprehensive    
 School at Market Rasen.               </content>
