		<title>20ST. PETER'S CHURCH</title>
		<content>  St. Peter's Church is a small church 
 in Halfway. It was dedicated by the   
 Archbishop of Canterbury on the 8th   
 October,1973. In the church there is a
 picture of a sculpture of the Virgin  
 and Child. The sculpture belonged to  
 Minster Abbey but was sold to the     
 Victoria and Albert Museum in London  
 for a sum of Â£7500. Half of this sum  
 was given to St. Peter's, the daughter
 church of Minster Abbey, enabling the 
 church to be free of debt. The        
 sculpture is thought have formed part 
 of a column or screen which included  
 the Blessed Virgin and also St.       
 Sexburgha, the founder of Minster     
 Abbey in 674 AD.                      
  St. Peter's has a visitors book with 
 signatures of people from places such 
 as Aylesbury and Holland.
