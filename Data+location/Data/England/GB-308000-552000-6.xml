		<title>06Landscape - The Promenade</title>
		<content> The {Promenade }is  one  of  the  main
 attractions of Silloth.   It runs from
 near the docks  almost two miles North
 to Skinburness. The Green lies between
 it and the town. At the Silloth end is
 the{Lifeboat Station, }which is run by
 volunteers. The inshore lifeboat is an
 inflatable craft which can travel very
 quickly  over  the  water.    Near the
 Skinburness end  is  a  crumbling  old
 'pill-box',   a  relic  of  the second
 World War.  The Promenade and{Sea-wall
 act as  defences against  the sea  and
 erosion.   Heavy  timber  break-waters
 project out  into the sea  at  regular
 intervals.   Much of the Promenade had
 to be rebuilt as recently as  1981  as
 running repairs were insufficient. Now
 steps  run  down  from the top  to the
 beach.  Locals and visitors alike love
 to  walk along the  Promenade  looking
 across the Solway to Scotland.        </content>
