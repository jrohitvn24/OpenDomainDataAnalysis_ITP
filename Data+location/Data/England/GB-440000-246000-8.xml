		<content> The Village has no formal Fete each   
 year unlike most of the other         
 surrounding Villages.                 
                                       
 However the Village School Parent     
 Teacher Association, holds            
 a School Fete, which has become the   
 traditional Village event,being       
 supported by most of the local Groups.
                                       
 Down in the valley,the Thames Water   
 Authority have built a sewerage       
 works.This was built in               
 around 1965 to cope with the increased
 effluent from the developing housing  
 in the village.
