		<title>17A COUNTRY WALK</title>
		<content> Stratford-on-Avon  country walk . On  
 Wednesday, 19th June, 1985, we went   
 for a walk to  Orchard Hill Farm.The  
 farmer showed us the place where they 
 kept Wellington Bombers a long time   
 ago.It was a tarmac track and the     
 bombers were kept there during the    
 last world war.The farmer also showed 
 us a field which had oil seed rape    
 growing in it and he thought the      
 Romans had built a fort.It was a very 
 good place to have it because you     
 could see all over the fields and the 
 River Stour.On the way back we saw the
 disused railway.You could even see the
 tracks where it had been built.They   
 were very_ faint but we could still   
 see them.We also saw an old bridge    
 which the trains used to go           
 under.Stephanie Pilbeam.9 years old.
