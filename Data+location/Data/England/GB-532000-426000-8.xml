		<title>08THE OLD RAILWAY,WITHERNSEA</title>
		<content>  The railway from Hull to Withernsea  
 was opened in 1854,having taken a year
 to build,and was closed in 1964 as    
 part of the Beeching axe.The local    
 council has recently dismantled the   
 platform and demolished the row of    
 workers' cottages.The station building
 is now somewhat derelict and used by  
 the market which is held on a         
 Thursday,Saturday and Sunday.The area 
 which formerly contained the turntable
 is now used for open-air stalls.The   
 Sunday market is particularly popular 
 and open all the year,drawing visitors
 from a wide area and often causing the
 town to be totally jam-packed.        
  In the meantime all evidence of the  
 railway is  disappearing and an       
 example of 19th Century industrial    
 archaeology is being lost.Street names
 survive,notably Railway Crescent and  
 Bannister St. named after the founder.</content>
