		<title>13WITCHES OF WARBOYS</title>
		<content> Warboys is known for its witches.     
 There is a sign of a witch on the     
 clock tower, on the village sign,     
 on the school badge and in many other 
 places.                               
 In 1589 a family called Throckmorton  
 moved into the Manor House next to    
 the church.All five girls in the      
 family started to have fits.When an   
 old lady called Alice Samuel visited  
 them the girls accused her of being a 
 witch and of causing the fits.        
 Two doctors could  not cure the girls.
 Sometimes the old lady admitted she   
 was a witch,sometimes she denied it.  
 The fits continued and later, Alice   
 Samuel, her husband and her daughter  
 were taken to Huntingdon jail and     
 tried for witchcraft.They were found  
 guilty and hung.Their bodies were     
 exhibited to the public. Nobody knows 
 what happened to the girls.           </content>
