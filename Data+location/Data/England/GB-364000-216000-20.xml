		<title>20MAY DAY AT MITCHELDEAN</title>
		<content>    The recent introduction of the May 
 Day Bank Holiday has led to a revival 
 of traditional customs. The Forest of 
 Dean Morris Men dance at dawn on the  
 summit of May Hill, a well known local
 viewpoint. In 1985 they also danced in
 Mitcheldean Church, as part of a      
 special service, and afterwards in the
 churchyard as part of a May Day Fair, 
 with stallholders in traditional dress
 of long skirts, aprons, blouses,      
 shawls and mop caps. There was a      
 Maypole with coloured ribbons, and    
 girls handed out flowers from baskets.
