		<title>18A  DAY  IN  THE  LIFE  OF..</title>
		<content>    My name is{Daniel Chugg.}I am      
 twelve years old and live in          
 Exeter. My alarm goes off at about    
 7.10 and Mum comes in with a cup of   
 tea at about 7.25. I usually take my  
 time getting up, dressed and washed.  
 I often finish this at about 7.45.    
 then I go downstairs to a{breakfast}of
 bacon and scrambled egg then finish   
 getting ready for school and I leave  
 at approximately 8.20.                
    In an average day at{school}we     
 have; assembly, maths, break,         
 language, french, lunch, humanities   
 and the last lesson varies.           
    As soon as I get{home}I have a     
 drink and relax for a few minutes.    
 Homework is next, then supper. After  
 this I will either have a music       
 lesson, or do some practice. Next I   
 will play, or watch television, then  
{go to bed}at around ten o'clock.      </content>
