		<content> yes, there are quite a few shcool age 
 children living in rowney Green.      
 Their ages range from tiny tot up to  
 16 and above.  They go to school at   
 the age of four or five and leave at  
 the age of 16.  There is a small      
 playgroup in Rowney Green at the      
 'Peace memorial Hall', but it is very 
 small.  All the older children have to
 travel to school either by car or by a
 specially laid on coach.  The schools 
 that they attend are as follows,      
 Bromsgrove, Alvechurch, Deloey Abbey  
 High, solihull and St Augustines      
 Beoley for the 5 and over and the     
 Abbey etc for 9 an over, although some
 children attend private schools.      
 Although the village is remote and    
 small, but steadily growing, there is 
 plenty accoridng to our survey and the
 villagers for the children to do eg.  
 disco's.                              </content>
