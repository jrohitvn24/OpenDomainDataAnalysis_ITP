		<title>01GENERAL OVERVIEW</title>
		<content> The area is rural and residential. The
 development mainly took place as a    
 result of the Industrial revolution,  
 with many small communities centred   
 around mills. The Rivers played an    
 important part in this although now   
 only provide recreation and drinking  
 water. The population is mainly fairly
 stable and there is a growth of       
 infilling of housing. Almost all      
 housing is in local stone and there is
 a conservation policy through the area
 plan on any building or development.  
 Communications are easy and swift,    
 mainly by road. There is a wide social
 and demographic spread of the         
 population. There is concern over the 
 decline of rural small communities    
 owing to lack of employment,          
 facilities and transport. It is a     
 beautiful area to live in.
