		<title>03Population in the Cowtons</title>
		<content> A survey of the population in the area
 shows a striking contrast between the 
 residents in North &amp; East Cowton. With
 its new estates, East Cowton attracts 
 young executives who generally have   
 two or three children. Houses change  
 ownership more often than in N Cowton 
 where residents are often from old    
 village families. East Cowton is more 
 densely populated. On average 3.5     
 people live in a house, whereas the   
 average in North Cowton is 2.1. There 
 is a higher proportion of OAP's in    
 North Cowton, 20% in the survey, as   
 opposed to 7% in East Cowton. Children
 form 35% of the population in E Cowton
 whereas in N Cowton they only form 20%
 South Cowton has a scattered          
 population of approx. 100. Like North 
 Cowton they are mostly old Cowton     
 families and a high proportion of them
 are involved with farming.            </content>
