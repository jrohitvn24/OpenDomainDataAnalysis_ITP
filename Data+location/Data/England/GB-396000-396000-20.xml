		<content>  Checking Amenities, we found our area
 is very badly served. There are two   
 public houses and one small corner    
 shop just out of the area. Bus Stops  
 are a good walk away. The GPO and     
 other shops are a mile away downhill. 
 There are no designated playing fields
 only the school field or farmland.    
 There is a large park, about 1/2 mile 
 away. It is served by a Junior and    
 Infant School. Comprehensive Schools  
 are 1.5 miles in either direction.    
 Football Club, Tennis Club, 0.5 miles.
 Swimming, Squash 1.5 miles, as are    
 Churches, Scouts, etc. The Hill makes 
 it a laborious return walk. Cinema,   
 Railway and Bus Station approx.       
 1.5miles distant.It is essentially a  
 residential area. a car or two is     
 necessary to take advantage of        
 amenities outside the near locality.
