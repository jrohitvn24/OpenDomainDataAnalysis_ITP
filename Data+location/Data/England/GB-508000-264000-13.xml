		<title>13INTERVIEW WITH FARMER cont.</title>
		<content>   The River Kym flows through the     
 property &amp; when in flood makes access 
 difficult.Mail, bread, milk, &amp; papers 
 (Telegraph,News of the World,Hunts    
 Post, Trader &amp; Jackie) are left       
 regularly in a box halfway to the main
 road.                                 
   The family enjoy farm life, the     
 fresh air &amp; freedom of space.         
 Mr.Campion plays tennis for a local   
 club, his daughter likes riding, his  
 son rifle shooting &amp; his wife enjoys  
 T.V. _ especially "Crossroads".       
 They own several cars, a Land Rover &amp; 
 a black Labrador dog.                 
   Mr.Campion enjoys farming, the only 
 disadvantages being the weather, some 
 unsocial hours &amp; the responsibility of
 decision making at different times.   
   There is no active Farmer's Union in
 this area.                            
                                       </content>
