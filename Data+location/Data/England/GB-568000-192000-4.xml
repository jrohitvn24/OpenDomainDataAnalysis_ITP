		<content> In summer Barleylands is busy with    
 people picking fruit, sometimes whole 
 families go, taking with them empty   
 ice cream cartons baskets or bowls to 
 fill with raspberries, strawberries,  
 loganberries, blackberries, black or  
 red currants.I go with my parents it's
 good fun because I eat nearly as many 
 as I pick, my favourite is straw_     
 berries. My mum freezes some, we eat  
 some for tea and the rest is made into
 jam. Farmers grow fruit for the P.Y.O.
 market because it is a high risk/high 
 cash crop.The advantages are that     
 workers do not have to be paid and    
 being on the edge of an urban area    
 there are plenty of customers.The     
 disadvantages are that the public eat 
 too many and that they and their      
 children damage the plants. If the    
 weather is bad people do not come and 
 the crop is spoiled.                  </content>
