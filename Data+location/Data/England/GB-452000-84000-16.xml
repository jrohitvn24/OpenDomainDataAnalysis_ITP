		<content>     Ben Brown is 8 years old and tells
 us about where he lives.  He says that
 there are many dust tracks round the  
 nearby fields where he can ride his   
 bike safely.  There are lots of trees 
 around.                               
     He likes to go down to the gravel 
 pit with his dad.  The gravel was dug 
 out for building but the area is now  
 being filled in, levelled with earth  
 and grass seed will be planted.       
     On the way to the gravel pit Ben  
 passes two reservoirs which are used  
 for fishing.  These are stocked with  
 carp, used for game fishing, as well  
 as trout and eels for eating.  Ben    
 uses a rod for fishing and also uses a
 net to put the fish in when caught.   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
