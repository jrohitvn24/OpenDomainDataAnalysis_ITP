		<title>17TOURISM IN THE HARVEL AREA</title>
		<content> Tourism in our area is a gentle       
 pastime often going unnoticed by local
 inhabitants.  Some people, en route,  
 stop to admire the duck pond or lambs 
 in the fields, while others come      
 intentionally to walk some of the many
 footpaths scattered across the area or
 to see the bluebells which carpet the 
 woodlands in spring.  Our pretty      
 country lanes provide interesting     
 riding for cyclists, and horse lovers 
 too have their bridlepaths.  Nature   
 ramblers and bird watchers find a     
 wealth of plant, animal and bird      
 life and the escarpment at Holly Hill,
 with its view over the Weald of Kent, 
 is ideal for those who come to sit and
 stare.  Even winter finds visitors    
 coming to toboggan down the escarpment
 or look upon the hedgerows, trees and 
 fields cloaked in a mantle of snow.
