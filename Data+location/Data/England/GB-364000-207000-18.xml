		<content>   The British School was opened in    
 1865 with 61 children in one large    
 room. Around the turn of the century  
 it had two classrooms and outside     
 toilets added to its original         
 partitioned room. In 1926 it was      
 further extended : a temporary wooden 
 building (five rooms) was provided for
 the 250+ scholars and it had now taken
 the name Blakeney Council School.     
 Today, almost 60 years later, this    
 script is being written in this       
 'temporary' building which now houses 
 two large classrooms, library and     
 office. The County Primary School has 
 only 83 pupils (33 boys and 50 girls),
 3.4 teaching staff, secretary (8 hrs),
 welfare assistant, part-time          
 caretaker, cook and 3 lunch time      
 supervisors. It also has a crossing   
 warden to help the children cross     
 the dangerous A48 trunk road.         </content>
