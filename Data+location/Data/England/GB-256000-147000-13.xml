		<title>13C M 's Own Magazine</title>
		<content>   The "Shammickite" is C M's own      
 magazine,first published in 1983 and  
 so called after an old Devonian word  
 meaning a shanty town.                
      This magazine, which comes out   
 each month except August, is produced 
 by a stalwart band of volunteers who  
 do the typing,printing and collating. 
 It is quite free and is supported by a
 small Council grant and donations.    
      Anyone can contribute items of   
 interest.  Regular features are       
 reports from the various clubs,       
 associations and leisure activities in
 the village.  There are also articles 
 from the main village churches and a  
 full report of the Parish Council     
 meetings.                             
      There is usually a quiz or       
 crossword puzzle and a list of        
 forthcoming events.
