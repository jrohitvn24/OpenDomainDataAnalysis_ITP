		<content> The agricultural pattern in the block 
 appears to be well established. An    
 examination of field patterns in 1839 
 shows a great change, however. Most   
 fields are now 'blocked'. For example,
 the triangular piece of land north of 
 426316 is now 2 fields but previously 
 was 6. Each were named and known as   
 Dovey Pool, Turnpike Field, William   
 Wenlock's Low Leasow, Whitland, Croft,
 Our Own Cow Leasow and Brickiln Field.
                                       
 One notable exception occurs in the   
 area intersected by  320320. These    
 were known as Milking Bank(in front of
 Colemere Woods Farm), Gorse Bank,     
 Thistly, Wood Leasow, Woodwell Leasow,
 Godfrey, Pole Shutt, Nantigodale,     
 Limekiln Leasow and Broomy Corner.    
 Most of these names are now out of use
 but some are still recognised by      
 farmers.                              </content>
