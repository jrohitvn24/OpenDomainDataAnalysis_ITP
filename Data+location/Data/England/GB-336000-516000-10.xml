		<content> BOTH THE NATIONAL TRUST AND THE       
 FORESTRY COMMISSION HAVE PLANTED TREES
 IN OUR AREA.  MANY OF THESE ARE STILL 
 VERY YOUNG AND MOST ARE EVERGREEN     
 TREES LIKE DOUGLAS FIR AND SCOTS PINE.
 IN AREAS CLOSER TO THE LAKE THE       
 NATIONAL TRUST HAS MADE EFFORTS TO    
 PLANT BROAD LEAVED TREES AS THESE ARE 
 THE NATURAL WOODLAND OF THE LAKE      
 DISTRICT.  ANY TIMBER WHICH IS CUT IS 
 USUALLY USED FOR FIRE WOOD OR FENCING 
 POSTS.THE LOWER PARTS OF OUR AREA HAVE
 LOTS OF DECIDUOUS TREES WHICH FORM    
 MAGNIFICANT COLOURS IN LATE AUTUMN.   
 THIS IS ONE OF THE ATTRACTONS TO      
 TOURISTS IN THIS PARTS OF CUMBRIA. THE
 OLDEST TREES ARE PROBABLY THE YEW     
 TREES IN THE CHURCH YARD.
