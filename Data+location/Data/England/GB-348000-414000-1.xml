      This rural area has a  long      
recorded history.The village of        
Mawdesley existed as early as 1288.    
Until very recently it was well-known  
for basket-making,the willow twigs     
grown in the area being particularly   
well-suited to this craft.             
      As its name suggests,there has   
been a church in Eccleston for many    
centuries,the earliest record of it    
being 1094.                            
      The area is very flat,nearby     
Harrock Hill providing a panoramic view
of it.The soil is heavy clay,and so it 
is mainly intensively farmed grassland.
      The Delph,a former quarry now    
water-filled,is a popular site for     
camping and picnics,and is used by     
sub-aqua clubs.
