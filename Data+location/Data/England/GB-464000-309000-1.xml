		<title>01General Review of the grid</title>
		<content>    The grid is primarily a farming    
 environment. The gently rolling       
 landscape is a patchwork of arable    
 fields and pasture, with some         
 woodland. Crops grown include wheat   
 and barley, while sheep and cattle are
 grazed on pasture.                    
    Settlement is limited to a small   
 number of scattered farms and houses, 
 although the village of Barkby touches
 on the south-west corner, and         
 Queniborough edges into the northern  
 boundary of the grid.                 
    The land slopes gently from higher 
 ground around Barkby Holt, in the     
 south-east corner, towards the        
 north-west. Two small streams drain   
 the area , Queniborough Brook to the  
 north, and Barkby Brook to the south. 
 Both streams occupy shallow valleys   
 and flow towards the north-west.
