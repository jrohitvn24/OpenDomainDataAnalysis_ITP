		<content> Of the 18 houses in the square most   
 are old red brick, one older house is 
 timber framed in part with white      
 plaster (wattle &amp; daub?). Six         
 semi-datached houses in a row,        
 originally built for farm workers but 
 now occupied by commuters.            
 Hedges are fairly high: mostly        
 hawthorn interspersed with the odd    
 holly. Some contain the trees of the  
{Perry Pear}now apparently no longer   
 gathered for this purpose.            
 Trees are grouped together, with the  
 odd one here and there in the         
 hedgerow; oak and ash predominate.    
 Plenty of blackbirds, thrushes, wood  
 pigeon sparrows and starlings are     
 present.                              
{No weedkiller}appears to have been    
 used and the grass beneath the hedges 
 is high, thus enabling voles etc. to  
 live.                                 </content>
