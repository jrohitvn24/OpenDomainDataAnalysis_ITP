		<title>20SHIPSTON AND THE M40</title>
		<content>  In the 1930s, the route of a possible
{by-pass}was planned for Shipston-on-  
 Stour.It was not built and the traffic
 problem in the town increased.        
                                       
  The new{M40}extension from Oxford to 
 Birmingham will be commenced in 1987  
 and should be finished in 1990.This   
 should reduce the traffic on the A34  
 through Shipston.It is estimated that 
 the new motorway will take between    
 8000 and 12000 vehicles per day away  
 from the A34 at Shipston.             
                                       
  We asked people in Shipston if they  
 thought the M40 or a by-pass would be 
 better for Shipston.40% said that the 
 M40 would be better,while 60% thought 
 a by-pass would help more.            
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
