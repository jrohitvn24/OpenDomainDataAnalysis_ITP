		<content>  The site overall is very             
 beautiful.The field leading to the top
 of St. Catherine's Hill is very       
 uneven.The land seems very well cared 
 for.                                  
  One of the fields is used for the    
 grazing of cows.The field is not      
 large.It is enclosed by a wooden fence
 topped with barbed wire.              
  At the top of the hill,there are     
 evenly spaced trees.Between each tree 
 there appeared to be 3 or 4 metres    
 ofland that could be cultivated.The   
 paths seem to be lined with beautiful 
 pine trees.The scenery is part of Avon
 Forest Park which belongs to Dorset   
 County Council.
