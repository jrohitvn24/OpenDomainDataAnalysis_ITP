		<content> The name Marston is of Anglo-Saxon    
 derivation from Merston -"Marshtown"  
 and Moretaine or Moretayne is the name
 of a family of norman origin who lived
 in Marston in the 14th century.       
 The parish comprised scattered        
 settlements of Pillinge, Wood End,    
 Lower and Upper Shelton and Wootton   
 Green plus a number of farms.From the 
 mid- 19th century half the parish was 
 owned by the Duke of Bedford.Marston  
 saw much expansion along Station Road 
 and around the Rectory and Church yard
 with the expansion of the Brick       
 industry.Nearby is Millbrook station  
 on the Bedford - Bletchley line and   
 its proximity to the M1 has meant     
 recent pressure for development from  
 commuters.Further growth is at present
 limited by the lack of sewerage       
 capacity.
