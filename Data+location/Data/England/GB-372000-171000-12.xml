		<title>12HAMSWELL HOUSE, COLD ASHTON.</title>
		<content>   {Hamswell House}is a building of    
 special{architectural and historic    
 interest.From the shell porch at the  
 front there are beautiful{views}over  
 the terrace and along the valley to   
 Hamswell hamlet.                      
    Originally{owned}by Cold Ashton    
 Priory,over the centuries it has been 
 owned by the Popplewell family (mayors
 and merchants of Bristol),Dick        
 whittington's family,the Wills family 
 and Lady Dulverton.In the time of the 
{Civil War}it was owned by a cavalier  
 and the story goes that the body of a 
 cavalier who had apparently been      
 hiding in a secret passage was found  
 in recent years during alterations.   
    Around the house are extensive out 
 buildings, cottages and farm          
 buildings. The{estate}has now been    
 split up and sold separately as seems 
 to be the trend.                      </content>
