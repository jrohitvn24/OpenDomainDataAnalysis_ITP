		<title>17EAST MEON - VILLAGE</title>
		<content> The village of East Meon is situated  
 at the point where the River Meon,    
 flowing northwards from its source in 
 the springs of South Farm,is forced to
 flow westwards by the presence of the 
 steep slopes of Park Hill (207 ms) to 
 the north,which blocks its course.The 
 village has developed here in the     
 small area of lowland,in the river    
 valley between Park Hill and the Lower
 Hill (136ms) to the south.The village 
 probably grew up here because of the  
 presence of a water supply in an      
 otherwise dry chalk landscape and its 
 growth was probably due to the fact   
 thatit became a minor route centre for
 the area.The village,which was in     
 existence by the time of the Domesday 
 Book,has grown along these 2 roads but
 has always remained quite small.Today 
 some of its population still work in  
 agriculture but many have retired here</content>
