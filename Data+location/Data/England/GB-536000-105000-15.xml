		<title>15WOODINGDEAN'S FARMING ISSUES</title>
		<content> Crop spraying is a hard and dangerous 
 operation.If a passer by is walking   
 along it could get in to their lungs  
 and do some damage in their body.The  
 burning of stubble left by the year's 
 crops is a sight to see.The orange,red
 and yellow flames glow brightly, and  
 tiny black particles of crops land in 
 your garden.The smoke is a bit over   
 powering and smells and makes your    
 eyes water.The little black particles 
 of old crops are called smuts.When    
 they are manure spreading you get an  
 awful odour coming from the fields.   
     During the late summer of 1984    
 the local farmers suffered criticism  
 from many Woodingdean residents       
 concerning stubble burning and its    
 dangers. The local press and Southern 
 Television became involved.
