		<content> The majority of 'O' levels are taken  
 after three years at the School,      
 during which the subjects studied     
 cover as broad a spectrum as possible.
 In the third and fourth forms, a      
 variety of subjects are taught,       
 including History, English, Latin,    
 French, German, Mathematics. all the  
 Sciences, Craft and Design.  Some 'O' 
 levels are taken early in the fourth  
 form, but the majority are taken in   
 the fifth form, where the top two     
 forms take eight 'O' levels apiece and
 the lower two seven apiece.  The 'A'  
 level courses take two years and the  
 majority of pupils study a combination
 of three 'A' levels.  Furthermore, it 
 is possible to study one-year         
 subsidiary 'O' and 'AO' courses in the
 Lower Sixth, which include Astronomy, 
 Computer Studies, and Geometrical and 
 Engineering Design.                   </content>
