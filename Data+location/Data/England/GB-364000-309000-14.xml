		<content>   The village of Arleston lies to the 
 S.E. of Wellington, separated from it 
 by the old Roman Road Watling Street, 
 now the B5061.The village is made up  
 of a large estate of council houses   
 with a small complex of private houses
 to the E.,divided from neighbouring   
 Ketley by the A518 trunk road.The     
 oldest part of Arleston is the hamlet 
 to the S.of the village,a scattered   
 group of largely timber-framed        
 cottages,and a large house known today
 as Arleston Manor. According to local 
 tradition Arleston Manor was built as 
 a hunting lodge for King James I.The  
 timber-framed house has gables bearing
 the dates 1614 and 1630. The house    
 required intensive renovation in 1978 
 due,it was felt,to the construction of
 the M54,which separates the manor from
 the farmland which rises to the       
 immediate S.of Arleston.              </content>
