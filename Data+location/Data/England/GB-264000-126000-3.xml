		<content> Filleigh Mill was built in 1747 as a  
 flour mill (water mill). In 1922 it   
 became a sawmill for the Fortescue    
 estate.  The workforce varies between 
 three and seven men in the sawmill    
 itself and seven to ten men in the    
 forestry side.  The wood used is      
 mainly Douglas Fir from the 1,200     
 acres of forestry land.  They produce 
 fencing, shed timber, picnic tables   
 etc.                                  
 A house called 3, Mays Leary, was also
 once a mill.  When the mill was       
 working the men used to jump on the   
 millwheel while it was moving and walk
 on it.  A workman's young son         
 attempting this while the men were    
 away at lunch. Unfortunately he was   
 too small and fell down the side and  
 was crushed to death.
