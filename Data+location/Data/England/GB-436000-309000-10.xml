		<title>10Heather Women's Institute</title>
		<content> Heather Women's Institute was founded 
 in December 1966 and has maintained a 
 membership of 25-30.  Meetings are    
 held monthly with speakers on many    
 varied subjects, half the year in the 
 Chapel Schoolroom and half in the     
 Church Hall.  Visits are arranged     
 regularly to factories and places of  
 interest.  As well as being concerned 
 with the well-being of the whole      
 village.  Members serve on the        
 Village Hall Committee, School        
 Governing Body and Parish Council.    
 Support is given to National and      
 County events, WI events and          
 campaigns.  The neglect of Beresford  
 House, a Grade 2 listed building and a
 prominent feature in the village, led 
 to correspondence and deputations to  
 discuss the problems with the Local   
 Authority and it has now been         
 renovated and converted to flats.     </content>
