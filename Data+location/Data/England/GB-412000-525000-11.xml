		<title>11Local Employment</title>
		<content> Within the area of study there is     
 quite a high rate of unemployment.The 
 jobs which are available within the   
 area are very limited.At the moment   
 the most jobs are connected with      
 agriculture,the primary land use      
 within the area,there are other       
 sources of employment however.These   
 other sources of employment are on a  
 small scale,mainly small firms or     
 family businesses.There is a small    
 metal manufacturing firm in Ramshaw   
 called West Tees Engineering,a roofing
 firm in Evenwood ,a family printing   
 firm called Northern Graphics and     
 shops which employ assistants.The     
 majority of people who are employed   
 and live in the area have to travel   
 out of the area to their place of     
 work.
