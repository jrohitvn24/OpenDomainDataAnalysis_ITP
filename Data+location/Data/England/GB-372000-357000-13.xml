 then and now has lived in the village 
 for 72 years,all her life.When she    
 came to her greengrocers shop,18 years
 ago it was just a house. She had it   
 made into a shop and lived there with 
 her husband and daughter.When she     
 first had a shop she shared a shop    
 with Mrs Parks who had a haberdashers.
  The village shops then were          
 Darlingtons the grocers,Rodens had the
 butchers followed by Cooks and Dennis 
 Thorley.The paper shop was in the same
 place but the Post Office was on the  
 other side of the bridge until the    
 bomb dropped.The SPAR shop was        
 Bullocks the bakers, and they baked   
 their own bread, cakes and pies. There
 were two chip-shops, two more shops   
 which sold groceries and sweets and a 
 wool an baby shop owned by a lady     
 called Jean.                          </content>
