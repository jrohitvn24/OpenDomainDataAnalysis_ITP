		<title>09HILPERTON WHARF</title>
		<content> Hiperton Wharf is situated on a narrow
 strip of land between the road and the
 Kennet and Avon Canal. It has now been
 turned into a marina for small motor  
 cruisers and can have up to 71 boats  
 moored at any one time.The majority of
 the vessels belong to private         
 individuals, although a small number  
 are the property of the Wharf's       
 owners.                               
      The present owners bought the    
 land and the Wharf Company in 1983 and
 completed the building of the jetty in
 1985.The business is expanding as a   
 result of many improvements. For      
 example, a workshop and dry dock are  
 soon to be built.                     
      There is very little problem with
 vandalism, but the owners did tell us 
 that earlier this year a tramp stole a
 packet of cornflakes from one boat and
 a bag of sugar from another.          </content>
