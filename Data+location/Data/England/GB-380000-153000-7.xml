		<content> Most households own a car; however    
 there is a frequent daytime bus       
 service to Trowbridge, Bath, Frome and
 Warminster. The nearest railway       
 stations are at Westbury, Bath and    
 Frome and trains take 90 minutes to   
 London. Papers can be purchased in    
 Southwick and are delivered in Rode   
 for a small charge. Local papers, The 
 Wiltshire Times and Somerset Standard 
 appear weekly,  but information on    
 village matters is found in the parish
 magazines. Rode's monthly magazine,   
 The Link, costing 15p, carries        
 information about the churches, clubs,
 parish council meetings, births and   
 deaths etc.. Villagers can send any   
 non-political items for publication.  
 The printing costs are partly met by  
 advertisements by local tradesmen.    
 There are public telephones in all the
 villages.                             </content>
