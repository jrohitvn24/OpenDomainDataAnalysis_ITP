		<content>   On our farming land most farms had {
{cattle}for milk or beef.In summer they
 graze outdoors but in winter they are 
 indoors and so need to be fed by the  
 farmer.Most of our area is covered by 
 grass belonging to farms and by crops 
 such as turnips and barley.All these  
 are for the animals to eat in winter  
 to keep them healthy.Our{land}has     
 gently sloping hills which drain well 
 and the{soil}is suitable for grass    
 growing although the farmers have to  
 treat it.Our{temperatures}are moderate
 not too hot and not too cold.Because  
 of the industrial population of Leeds 
 and Sheffield,there is a nearby market
 for our cattle produce.Other animals  
 we saw at the farms were sheep,horses,
 pigs and fowl.Few farmers             
 concentrated on arable crops only.
