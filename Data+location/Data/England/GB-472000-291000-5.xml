 bungalow with 8 rooms - 3 bedrooms,

 hall.I have one bedroom;my two        
 brothers share one;Mum and Dad have

 sand pit and a den where my brother   
 and I play.I have a garden where I    
 plant flowers;my Dad has a greenhouse.
 We have a run for the chickens,guinea 
 pig and pheasant.                     
{B.}The White House. My house,once a   
 farm, probably Victorian,has 13 rooms.
 We now park our cars in what used to  
 be the stables.Lots of bits of china  
 are in the soil where there was once a
 rubbish dump.There was a second       
 staircase,knocked down when a maid    
 fell down it killing herself.We have a
 big garden and small paddock.Dad looks
 after the vegetables,Mum the heathers 
 and flowers.                          </content>
