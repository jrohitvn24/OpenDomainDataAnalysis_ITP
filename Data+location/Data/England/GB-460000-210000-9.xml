		<content>We school children do maypole dancing  
every Summer for our fete.This year    
we did a lot of plaiting using 16      
ribbons between 8 boys and 8 girls.The 
music was recorded on a cassette       
player.In our annual dog show many     
kinds of dogs enter and there are      
prizes to be won.Second prize is a red 
rosette.Harvest festival is held at    
school and in the church.At school we  
make bread and act out a play.At church
there is a big flower and crop         
display.Once a year we hold an Inter-  
Village quiz.An ex-Mastermind winner   
makes up questions and local villages  
supply a team of adults to answer      
them.Oakley wins the cup nearly every  
year!                                  
Each year we hold a 5 a side children's
football match for surrounding village 
teams.
