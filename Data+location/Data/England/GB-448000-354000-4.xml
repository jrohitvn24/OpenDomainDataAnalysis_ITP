		<title>04Changes People Would Like</title>
		<content> People were asked what changes they   
 would like to see in Kirkby.   The    
 main one was more {play areas}and {   
{parks}for children.   The next was    
 more swimming baths and cinemas to go 
 to. A lot of people said more shops   
 would be nice and one said they would 
 like to see the old sort of shops come
 back.   People would like to see less 
 vandalism and lots of people were in  
 favour of more jobs, better roads and 
 more youth clubs.                     
    One man even said he'd like to blow
 up Kirkby and start again.  A few     
 people said they would like to see    
 Kirkby kept cleaner, more police and  
 more things for handicapped people.   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
