		<title>10WARRINGTON TOWN HALL</title>
		<content>    In 1847, the town was granted the  
 status of a municipal corporation and 
 a council was elected, comprising a   
 Mayor, nine aldermen and twenty-seven 
 councillors. The original Town Hall   
 building now stands in Golden Square  
 but, by 1870, this had become         
 inadequate. Fortunately Bank Hall,    
 home of Lord Winmarleigh, was bought  
 with the aid of Lord Winmarleigh      
 himself and George Crossfield. The    
 Hall had been built in 1750 by James  
 Gibb for the Patten family,           
  later to become Wilson-Patten then   
 Lord Winmarleigh.                     
    At the front of the Town Hall are  
 some magnificent cast-iron gates 25   
 feet high and 54 feet across given to 
 the town in 1893 by Frederick Monks   
 and have recently been re-gilded and  
 fully restored.
