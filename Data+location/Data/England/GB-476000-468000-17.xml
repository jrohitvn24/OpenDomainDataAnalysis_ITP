		<content> The company tries to be as            
 self-sufficient as possible. It       
 operates its own transport, Bright    
 Steels Transport Ltd., which owns a   
 fleet of lorries that carry loads of  
 steel in and out of the works and     
 delivers its products throughout the  
 Unithed Kingdom, principally to       
 stock-holders who are able to cater   
 for users' individual requirements.   
                                       
 The bulk of the company's production  
 is in the mild steel range, but other 
 qualities produced include American,  
 German and Swedish standards as well  
 as British. Close quality control     
 enables the firm to compete           
 successfully in these export markets. 
                                       
 Recent expansion has enabled  Bright  
 Steels to draw flats up to ten inches 
 wide and four inches thick.           </content>
