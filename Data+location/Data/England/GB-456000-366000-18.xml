		<content>  Most children in our school go on    
 holiday in Britain.A few go abroad,   
 Spain and France being the most       
 popular countries to visit.           
  Many local children visit the        
 Lincolnshire coastal resorts,Skegness 
 in particular.The N.W.of England,     
 especially Blackpool,is popular as are
 places on the Yorkshire coast.Resorts 
 in Devon and Cornwall are visited but 
 to a lesser extent.                   
  Family seaside holidays are the most 
 usual but quite a number of children  
 have countryside holidays.            
  Caravans are the most popular type of
 accommodation,though hotels and guest 
 houses are often used.A smaller number
 of families choose tenting holidays or
 they stay in purpose_built camps such 
 as Butlin's,where entertainment is    
 provided.
