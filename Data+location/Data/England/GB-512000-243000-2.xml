		<title>02The Shuttleworth Family</title>
		<content> The most well known of the            
 Shuttleworths was Richard who became  
 squire of Old Warden in 1913.He built 
 the aerodrome at Old Warden and made a
 collection of old cars and aeroplanes,
 which he restored to working          
 order.These cars and planes provided  
 the nucleus from which the            
 Shuttleworth Collection of today has  
 been built up.On his death in 1940 the
 estate and possessions were left to   
 his wife and as a fitting memorial to 
 Richard and his father the House was  
 turned into the present Agricultural  
 College.                              
 Much of the village still remains the 
 property of the estate and has been   
 given the county's protection so that 
 development in this area is very      
 restricted.
