		<title>10BERYSTEDE HOTEL</title>
		<content> The original hotel was built in the   
 1870's by the Standish family in 30   
 acres of land in the Tudor and Gothic 
 style.The turrets may have been the   
 influence of Henry Standish's french  
 wife.Royalty were frequent visitors;  
 the Prince of Wales comforting the    
 family after the 1886 fire.The ghost  
 of the maid who tried to rescue jewels
 given to her by guests haunts the     
 hotel to this day.In recent years a   
 new block and a conference room have  
 been added.The leisure facilities     
 available include a pool,putting green
 and Victorian garden set in 9 acres of
 land.The hotel employs 118 people but 
 only 30% are local.Ascot week has     
 always been a highlight of the year   
 from the time when Royalty visited to 
 the present day when it is the busiest
 time of the year.
