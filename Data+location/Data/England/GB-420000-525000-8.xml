		<content> My name is Shelley Atkinson and I am  
 11 years old.I have a brother called  
 Darren who is nearly 8 years old and  
 another brother called Richard who is 
 2 years old.Darren and I both go to   
 All Saints' School but I will soon be 
 going to Sunnydle Comprehensive School
 in Shildon. We live in a terraced     
 house very close to our present       
 school. It has 3 bedrooms,a kitchen,a 
 lounge,a dining room and a bathroom   
 and toilet. My Dad has built a shed in
 the back yard for our bikes.We own a  
 car which my Dad uses for work. He    
 takes my Mam shopping in the car and  
 often takes us out for a drive to the 
 seaside or up into the dales.
