		<title>08LOCAL HISTORY - BATTISFORD</title>
		<content>Battisford parish has 2 Manors, the    
Manor of Battisford Hall and the Manor 
of St. John's.   This last Manor was   
originally the site of a hospital of   
the Order of St. John of Jerusalem     
until the Dissolution.  It was then    
sold to the Gresham family, as was the 
other Manor which had been the property
of the Bishop of Norwich.  A member of 
the Gresham family, Sir Thomas, founded
the Royal Exchange in London, and the  
framework of that building was         
constructed from local wood on the     
common before being transported to     
London.  Flints from a pit at          
Battisford were used to cobble Needham 
Market High Street.  The common was    
enclosed in 1812 and a new road,       
Battisford Straight Road made through  
the middle.  The Church of St. Mary's  
is mostly of 14th century work.
