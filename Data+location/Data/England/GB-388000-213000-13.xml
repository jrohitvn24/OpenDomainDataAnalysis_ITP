		<content>{Election night} ia a subtle blend of  
relief and tension-the weeks of        
campaigning are over but the waiting   
for the result means anxiety.          
At the count all those inside are sworn
to secrecy,unable to communicate with  
the world outside until the count is   
over.Unless the result is very close   
there will be no recount and the       
victor's smile normally alerts those   
present to the outcome.This will be    
around midnight as in this years local 
election but the count can go on much  
longer in a parliamentary campaign.    
After this {local election},however,the
candidates can go home to celebrate,be 
consoled,or even to wonder if it was   
all worthwhile.                        
In a typical class of 14 year olds only
1 person out of 25 knew the name of    
their {local councillor}.
