		<title>18Fun Run</title>
		<content> North Weald has a Fun Run every year  
 which is 5 miles long. About 400      
 people run in it. The course is very  
 muddy at the village hall. Lots of    
 people enjoy it even though it is     
 muddy. The run makes a lot of money   
 for charity. Usually there is over    
 Â£80 raised. Everybody gets a          
 certificate at the end of the run.    
 Craig Robins dad organises the Run and
 a lot of children went but not many   
 parents go in for it.
