		<title>01Blandford Forum - Gazetteer</title>
		<content>  Almost entirely destroyed by fire    
 in 1731 Blandford Forum is a lovely   
 Georgian town with attractive narrow  
 streets and an interesting roof       
 pattern typical of its time. Its re-  
 building over 30 years led to a       
 uniform character of architecture and 
 to inclusion in the Council of British
 Archaeology's list of 51 towns of     
 national importance. The spacious     
 Market Place,Town Hall,Parish Church  
 and Coupar House are perfect examples 
 of Georgian architecture. For contrast
 nearby are two buildings which escaped
 the fire,'The Old House' in the Close 
 and the Ryves Almshouses founded in   
 1682.The manor is referred to in the  
 1086 Domesday Survey as Chipping      
 Blaneford. It lies 18 miles North West
 of Bournemouth on the river Stour     
 where it cuts through the rolling     
 chalk Dorset Downs.                   </content>
