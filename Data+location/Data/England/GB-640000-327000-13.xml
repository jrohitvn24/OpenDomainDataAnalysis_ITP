		<content> some women and evening classes are    
 well attended.                        
 During winter months thick warm coats 
 or anoraks are essential to keep out  
 the cold east winds, but during the   
 summer months holiday makers wear very
 brief beachwear whenever possible.    
{SHOPPING IN NORTH NORFOLK             
 This is an account of shopping trends 
 for an average family of four people. 
 Shopping may be done as little as two 
 times a week, as food can be stored in
 a refridgerator or a freezer, or as   
 often as each day, using small village
 stores.                               
 The supermarkets referred to are "Fine
 Fare" or "International" at North     
 Walsham, "Sainsbury's" at Great       
 Yarmouth or Norwich and "Roy's" of    
 Wroxham. Any of these are at least 12 
 miles from Sea Palling.
