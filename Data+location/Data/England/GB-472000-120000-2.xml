		<content>{Type of Farm:}Most of the farms in the
 area are a mixture of arable and      
 livestock.  The large proportion of   
 pasture land is usually included as   
 part of the crop rotation. {          
{Chemical Treatment:}All farms  use    
 herbicides, fungicides and pesticides 
 except Stanbridge which does not use  
 pesticides.  Weston and Bolinge Hill  
 Farms suffer from slug damage which is
 increasing in spite of treatment and  
 may be the result of a natural        
 predator being killed by chemicals.   
{Housing:}All farm workers live in farm
 accommodation.                        
{Landlords:}Apart from Bolinge Hill    
 Farm and Jacobs Yard the land is      
 partly or wholly owned by Trinity     
 College, Cambridge.
