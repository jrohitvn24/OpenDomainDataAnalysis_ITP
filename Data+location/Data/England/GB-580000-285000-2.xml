		<title>02F.C. DEPOT SANTON DOWNHAM</title>
		<content> The Depot has a Forest District       
 Manager, three Line Managers who are  
 senior Foresters responsible for      
 Marketing, Forest Management and the  
 Brandon Depot. There are also 21      
 Foresters, 180 industrial staff, a    
 deputy, office staff, Land Agent, Work
 Study and Training teams. One of the  
 most important aspects is the 19      
 polythene houses where over 2m        
 Corsican pine seedlings are raised    
 annually. Stock for planting is ready 
 after 18 weeks plus a hardening       
 period. The seedlings are planted by a
 modified Finn machine and it only     
 needs 2 teams of 2 men to cope with   
 the whole re_planting programme.      
 Co_operation with the Nature          
 Conservancy Council and similar groups
 is intended to maintain and improve   
 the Forest for wildlife and humans.
