		<title>19Laurie Lee Interview (2)</title>
		<content> Despite his love for the valley Laurie
 Lee sees the need for a small         
 shop,post office,school and a village 
 hall,so that people could meet for    
 more events and form a stronger       
 community.Also Slad needs a more      
 frequent bus service so people could  
 mix,rather than be secluded in those  
 metal boxes called cars!.             
  Laurie Lee also feels strongly about 
 heavy goods vehicles driving through  
 the village and would like to see them
 banned.He would like to see the valley
 unchanged well into the future.He     
 hopes to have no more threat from     
 Council road-side weed-killer,killing 
 the plants and damaging the land which
 inspired him so much.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
