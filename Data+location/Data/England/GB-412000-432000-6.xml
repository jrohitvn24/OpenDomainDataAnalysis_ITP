		<title>06How I Spend My Saturday</title>
		<content>   by Aisha Ejaz.                      
 On Saturday my sisters and I wake up  
 and go to the bathroom and wash our   
 faces and hands and while we are doing
 that we say a prayer.It is a special  
 kind of prayer.The prayer is Bissmilla
 irahma neraheem.After that we brush   
 our teeth.Then we have a bath and the 
 bath is a bubble bath so that we can  
 get clean.Then we get dry and go to   
{mosque}and then we read loud.This     
 makes God very proud of us then we    
 read another{Koran}and then we can    
 play with some toys if we have been   
 good.After we have played we get our  
 shoes on and go home.Then we read on a
 special mat and after that we read a  
 book.Then we have another bath.After  
 our bath we get dry and drink some    
 milk.Then our mother brushes our hair.
 Then we say a prayer and then we go to
 bed.                                  </content>
