		<title>08WIZARDWOOD KENNELS &amp; CATTERY</title>
		<content>    Then Wizardwood kennels and cattery
provides a service for people who want 
their cats and dogs looking after      
whilst they are on holiday. The kennels
can house upto 16 dogs and 20 cats and 
people can have them looked after for  
as long as they wish.                  
     The centre is run by a family who 
also have an interest in breeding and  
showing their own high pedigree dogs.  
They currently have 10 such animals.   
     Any dog staying at the kennels can
expect to have two runs a day. Because 
of its rural setting the dogs have no  
shortage of space and are often walked 
in nearby fields.                      
     The animals are fed once daily, in
the afternoon, and are generally given 
what their owner recommends.
