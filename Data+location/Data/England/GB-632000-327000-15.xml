		<title>15A HONING SATURDAY</title>
		<content> In the morning on Saturdays we have to
 go to the music centre at Nth. Walsham
 about 5 miles away. Usually we go with
 Louise's dad in his car.When we arrive
 we get the chairs out for singing. One
 of the songs we sing is 'The Telephone
 Book Lullaby'. After singing we have a
 break. We have orange squash and a    
 biscuit. After that Louise and I play 
 our descant recorders. Laura teaches  
 us. When we have finished we go into  
 town to buy the household groceries.  
 When we have been to the shops we go  
 home. My dad takes us home. In the    
 summer we then get the sunbeds out and
 lie on them. We have tea indoors, then
 we watch T.V.                         
   (Instruction at the music centre is 
 provided by volunteers. Instruments   
 taught include recorders, percussion, 
 violins, flute, brass wind instruments
 -little instruction is done in school)</content>
