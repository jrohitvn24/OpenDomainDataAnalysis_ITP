		<content> BOTTOR ROCK AND BEACON LANE           
 BEACON LANE IS A FORMER PACKHORSE     
 LANE AND IS FOUR HUNDRED YEARS OLD .  
 THE LOCAL SCHOOL IN HENNOCK ARE USING 
 IT AS PART OF THEIR GREEN LANE PROJECT
 WHICH INVOLVES HISTORY,               
 GEOGRAPHY,CONSERVATION AND SCIENCE. AT
 THE MOMENT IT IS NOT USED VERY MUCH   
 EXCEPT BY YOUNGSTERS WHO USE IT FOR   
 SCRAMBLING WITH THEIR MOTOR           
 BIKES.THERE ARE SOME COPSE OF TREES   
 BUT ALL THE OLD ELMS HAVE DIED DUE TO 
 DUTCH ELM DISEASE . THE MAJORITY OF   
 THE TREES ARE SYCAMORE, HAZEL AND     
 BEECH. WILD LIFE ABOUNDS BADGERS,     
 SQUIRRELS, FOXES AND RABBITS. THE     
 CHILDREN ARE KEEPING SECRET THE       
 EXISTENCE OF THE BADGER SETTS BECAUSE 
 OF THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTRES POLICY 
 OF POISONING THEM BECAUSE OF BOVINE   
 T.B.
