		<title>10THE SHIP INN AT LEVINGTON</title>
		<content> The Ship Inn was built in the 14th    
Century near Levington Creek. The      
village used to be here but the        
survivors of the Black Death built a   
new village further away. The Ship     
Inn used to be two cottages. Before it 
was called The Ship, it was known as   
The Tankard.  It had a long tradition  
of smuggling and inside there is a     
smuggler's cupboard. It got its name   
because it was built from ship's       
timbers. It has only been passed       
down to two families in the last 70    
years.                                 
  The Ship Inn has recently been       
extended, but it is still a traditional
Pub. Before the extension it was very  
small indeed. It now serves food which 
is prepared without any micro-wave     
ovens. It is the only Pub in the       
village. It is popular with locals and 
people in the surrounding areas.       </content>
