		<title>10WETHERBY RACECOURSE</title>
		<content>  This is a National Hunt course.      
 Horses were placed in the stables and 
 guarded there. Then they were paraded.
 Next we saw people judging the horses 
 before, perhaps, placing a bet with   
 either the Tote or one of the many    
 bookmakers' stalls gathered in front  
 of the main stand. The 'bookies' came 
 from various places, including other  
 racecourse towns e.g. York. One from  
 Hamilton came{"because in Scotland    
{there are 3 p's porridge, potatoes &amp;  
{poverty".}Changing odds in the betting
 were sent between 'bookies' in special
 semaphore by someone called a         
 'Tick-Tack' man. It was most obvious  
 that the horses tipped in the popular 
 press came nowhere! There were no     
 plans for increasing the range of     
 attractions, although an increase in  
 popularity and success was hoped for.
