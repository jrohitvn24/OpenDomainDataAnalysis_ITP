		<title>14Free Time in Ponteland</title>
		<content> We interviewed a few Ponteland people 
 aged between 15 and 70 about their    
 leisure activities.Most people spoken 
 to participated in some sports.Indoor 
 ones,such as squash and badminton are 
 offered at the{Sports Centre}and were 
 the most popular.Our speakers also    
 enjoyed more solitary activities such 
 as jogging and walking.The people we  
 spoke to rarely venture from home to  
 watch either live sport or visit the  
 theatre or cinema.this points to the  
 growing power of television,which     
 brings events into the home at a lower
 cost than attending in person.Indeed  
 watching television proved to be the  
 most popular recreation in the home,  
 although most people enjoy reading and
 gardening.Few of the more traditional 
 activities-painting drawing,handcrafts
 were practised.Visiting friends,places
 relatives,restaurant &amp; pub were common</content>
