      Along the coast at West Bay and  
 at Eype the two most popular pastimes 
 are swimming and fishing, but sailing,
 water-skiing and snorkelling have also
 become popular in recent years.       
      The Chesil beach is reputed to be
 one of the finest fishing beaches in  
 the whole of the British Isles. The   
 shingle beach stretches in a gentle   
 curve for about nineteen miles from   
 East Beach, West Bay, to Portland. It 
 is fishable at any state of the tide  
 and many different fish are caught    
 including cod, whiting, mackerel,     
 silver bass and pollack.              
      As well as shore fishing a number
 of boats at West Bay are used for     
 taking anglers out for deep sea       
 fishing trips.
