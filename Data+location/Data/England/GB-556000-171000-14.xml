		<title>14Bean: A New Quarry Proposed</title>
		<content>{ }Blue Circle Industries own land and 
 mineral rights in the Bean and Darenth
 Wood area.  They have applied for     
 planning permission to quarry at      
 Darenth Woods and lately on the site  
 of the Mabledon Hospital, which is    
 adjacent to the woods to the west.    
 Local people are very much opposed to 
 the scheme and to date permission has 
 been refused.  The manufacturers claim
 that modern quarrying methods allow   
 restoration to follow closely behind  
 extraction.  Washed out quarries can  
 be used as nature reserves or sites   
 for industry.  Alternatively they can 
 be filled in with household refuse.   
 When full, top soil is spread over the
 area which is then ready for          
 agriculture or recreation purposes.
