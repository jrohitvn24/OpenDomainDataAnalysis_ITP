		<title>02Fairy Farm - The People</title>
		<content> There are 6 people who live in the    
 house, it was biult in 1853. There was
 an older house built on the site but  
 it was burnt down.                    
 The family consists of the farmer, his
 wife and 4 children. They have got    
 some pets, 2 dogs and 1 cat. They have
 rabbits but not as pets, they are for 
 food.                                 
 The children go to Hedingham School   
 for their secondary education.        
 When the people were asked  if they   
 chose the name they said "No." Then   
 they said  that they didn't like the  
 name. They said that they would like  
 to change the name of the farm to     
 "Brick House Farm."
