		<content> A Day in the Life of Richard          
 I get up at about 8.15 a.m. to eat my 
 breakfast of shreddies.  I have a cup 
 of tea, when I am ready for school.   
 My friends knock for me and we arrive 
 at school at 8.55 a.m.  School starts 
 at 9.00 a.m. and we work until 10.30  
 a.m.  We have playtime for 15 minutes.
  On Fridays at 11.00 a.m. the children
 of a particular class take assemly and
 parents come and watch them at noon we
 have dinner.  We play until 1.05 p.m. 
 and continue our work until 2.40 p.m. 
 when we have a radio programme.  At   
 3.05 p.m. we go home I normally play  
 or watch television.  At about 6.30   
 p.m. I have my tea.  After I go to    
 youth club at 7.15 p.m.  Sometimes we 
 have a disco, or play table tennis,

 some games like rounders, football or 
 run-outs.                             </content>
