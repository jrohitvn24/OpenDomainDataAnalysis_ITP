		<content>  Herne Bay did not come into being as 
 a town until the early 19th Century   
 although there was settlement in the  
 area before recorded history began.   
   There was the {ancient village of   
{Herne},first recorded as having a     
 chapel in 1310,and part of the Hundred
 of Reculver;also{the small fishing    
{hamlet}on the shores of Herne parish. 
  The majority of people were farming  
 folk or fishermen and sometimes       
 smugglers too!                        
  In 1816,previously marshy lowland    
 between Herne Village and the sea was 
 developed. Streets were arranged in a 
 symmetrical pattern parallel to the   
 sea.A pier built in 1831 brought steam
 packets to the town and it became a   
 holiday centre;the railway's arrival  
 in 1861 enhanced this trade. In 1881  
 the towns population was 4,410- in    
 1981 it was 27,528.                   </content>
