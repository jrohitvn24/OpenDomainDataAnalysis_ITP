		<title>19FAMILY LIFE ON SUNDAYS</title>
		<content>  0n Sundays my dad likes a lie in but 
 usually my sister wakes him up,she is 
 only 4 yrs. old.When my sister doesn't
 wake him up my dad gets up at 10.30,  
 so does the rest of the family.We all 
 go downstairs for our breakfast.      
  Sometimes on a Sunday we go to the   
 seaside.We get ready and go in the car
 to Scarborough.                       
  As usual when we get there we can't  
 get parked.So we usually try to park  
 where the lifts are and can often     
 manage to park there.We walk from     
 there to the sea front.We go on the   
 amusements and the ghost train, then  
 we have tea.After that we go home.    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
