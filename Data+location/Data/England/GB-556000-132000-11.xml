		<title>11Pheasant Shooting in Sussex</title>
		<content>                                       
 Shoots are organised in Eridge Old    
 Park for the shooting of pheasants,   
 partridge and duck.Many of the        
 pheasants are raised by the game      
 keeper near Sham Farm.They are        
 incubated from eggs and kept in runs  
 until they are old enough to be let   
 loose in the wood.The keeper continues
 to feed them until they are quite     
 mature.                               
    When the shooting season begins,   
 local people are hired to act as      
 beaters.Shoots are organised for small
 parties,sometimes American visitors.  
 The guests attending the shoot are    
 well entertained with a special picnic
 lunch to accompany the days shooting.
