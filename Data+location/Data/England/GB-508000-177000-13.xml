		<title>13Hayes Town</title>
		<content> My group covered Hayes Town. It was   
 not very large, but was very busy for 
 its size. Most buildings were shops or
 houses and it was very noisey with the
 airport and station nearby. Hayes did 
 not offer a variety of shops; there   
 were lots of food markets. It had only
 one playing field and park and the    
 sports facilities were not up to a    
 very good standard. There were not    
 enough snack bars or restaurants.  All
 the health shops were hidden and      
 small. The main roundabout was badly  
 organised and very dangerous without  
 lights.  We saw one factory which gave
 off steam every so often. Most of the 
 houses were terraced or semi-detached 
 council houses.  There were two petrol
 stations near together instead of     
 being at either end of Hayes Town.
