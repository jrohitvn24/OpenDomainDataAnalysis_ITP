		<title>03ST. MARY'S CHURCH, WHITTON</title>
		<content> Services held every 2nd.and 4th Sunday
 in the Month.This year the Community  
 Services have replaced a steep muddy  
 bank with concrete and brick steps    
 leading up to this lovely Church.The  
 Church yard is surrounded by a wooden 
 fence and shrubs.The Church yard looks
 a little untidy,but this is because of
 the abundance of wild flowers and     
 daffodils which are allowed to flower 
 and seed before being cut.The kissing 
 wicket at the top entry to the Church 
 was stolen in February this year and  
 never found,so a new one was          
 bought.The Quota contribution for St. 
 Marys is Â£410.There is an average     
 congregation of 5.During the past year
 there have been 2 Christenings,3      
 Funerals and the last wedding was 4   
 years ago.Heating is provided by an   
 oil boiler.Tony Mantle is the local   
 grave digger and the charge is Â£30.   </content>
