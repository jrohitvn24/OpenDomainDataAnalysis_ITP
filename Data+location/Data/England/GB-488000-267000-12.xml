		<content> unfolds. Batsmen cross over a doorstep
 once owned by the incomparable Dr. W. 
 G. Grace. Bowlers thunder along a     
 strip of green once trodded by Boris  
 Karloff. The ground is full of ghosts 
 who made the same errors of judgment  
 as the present batsmen who trudges    
 wearily back to the pavilion. It is a 
 microcosm of the whole school. Perhaps
 ghosts hover in the Common Room, too, 
 where notices are discreet and voices 
 restrained to a low, bass murmur as   
 the same triumphs and disasters are   
 recounted as our forebears knew.      
 Wellingborough School stands as it has
 stood for centuries, self-assured,    
 self-sufficient, friendly, confident -
 England at its best, warts and all.
