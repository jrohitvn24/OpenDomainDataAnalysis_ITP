		<content>         The Churchyard                
 Extensions at different times have    
 made the Churchyard a rather curious  
 shape.   It contains much of beauty in
 trees, shrubs and flowers.  Some      
 ancient a stones to be found in the   
 Churchyard include a low cross near   
 the porch, said to be Celtic in       
 origin, and a granite cross found on a
 farm and now incorporated in a        
 tombstone near the northern wall.     
      The Lych-gate was given in memory
 of the parents of the Misses Vivien   
 and near it is the stately cross of   
 grey stone from the Forest of Dean,   
 which is the village War Memorial.    
 It is over 22 feet high, surmounted by
 a "Calvary", and was erected by the   
 widow of Major Herbert Carter. v.c.,  
 whose grave is nearby.
