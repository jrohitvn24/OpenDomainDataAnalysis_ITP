		<title>05CHELFORD CATTLE MARKET</title>
		<content>    Livestock sales take place every   
 Monday and every Thursday. This is the
 most important aspect of the market.  
    We made our visit on a Monday      
 morning. Selling started at 9.00am and
 finished at 2.00pm.                   
    There were ten classes as follows:-
 calves,eggs,weanlings,poultry,dairy   
 cattle,butcher's cattle,produce       
 sundries,store sheep and goats, and   
 vegetables and plants.                
    All the sales are by auction. Local
 people bring the animals by truck and 
 by train. The majority of buyers are  
 also local.                           
{   Sale of Animals.}This takes place  
 in rings. The auctionneer is in a box 
 overlooking the ring into which       
 animals are brought individually. The 
 buyers stand round the outside or sit 
 on terraced seats.
