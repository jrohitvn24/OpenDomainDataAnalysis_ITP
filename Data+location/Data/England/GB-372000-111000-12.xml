		<content>   In 1884 the little church was       
 completely rebuilt exactly as it used 
 to be.As it stands right next to the  
 big house the then Squire decided to  
 use it more as a private chapel and   
 built a small hutted church for the   
 parishioners in Kingstag.             
   The intriguing thing about the      
 church is that there are two          
 memorials,chronologically separated by
 some 650 years but linked. The first  
 is that of Igleramus de Wallace who is
 believed to have founded the little   
 church and whose tomb shows him to    
 have been a crusader. The second is   
 to Captain Farr Yeatman who died      
 outside Jerusalem in 1917.
