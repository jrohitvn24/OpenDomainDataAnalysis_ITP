		<content>    In the drawing room, there is a    
 Japanese embroidered picture of       
 peacocks on white silk. On the ceiling
 there is Rocco plaster work showing   
 the Sun God in the centre.            
   In the Orangery, there is a big,    
 stuffed fish which is part of a       
 collection of animal heads. On the    
 floor you can see the marks of the    
 plant pots in which oranges used to be
 grown.                                
   In the china room, there is lots of 
 expensive china and some particularly 
 fine green plates decorated with white
 birds.                                
   In the museum, there are many       
 exhibits from different wars and some 
 medals which are mainly connected with
 the Canadian Light Infantry.
