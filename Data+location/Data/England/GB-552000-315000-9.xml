		<content> There is a large CHURCH in Walpole St.
 Peter which is sometimes called the   
 cathedral of the Fens.Built in the    
 14th century its large size indicates 
 the great wealth in the area at that  
 time.This wealth came from sheep      
 farming.Today a new vicarage is being 
 built next to the church ready for the
 arrival for a new incumbent.There is a
 church at Walpole St Andrew but two   
 years ago this became redundant.There 
 is an additional Methodist church and 
 schoolroom.The main church service is 
 held at 10:30a.m.each Sunday,whilst   
 the Methodists' meet on a Sunday      
 afternoon.It is interesting to note   
 that above the Walpole St. Peter      
 Church porch there is the original    
 schoolroom which was opened in 1723   
 and paid for by Anthony Curton.
