		<content>   The Cumberland Farmers Foxhounds    
 Point-to-Point is held annually at    
 Holme Hill Parks, about one mile south
 east of Dalston, on the first Saturday
 in March.                             
   Each year about 200 horses come     
 to participate from all over northern 
 England and southern Scotland. These  
 horses are almost all thoroughbred and
 have hunted with one of the region's  
 many foxhound packs.                  
   The course is a large circuit over  
 park and pasture land, with sixteen   
 birch_stick fences over two laps of   
 the course.                           
   The main attraction of the day is   
 the eight races; however, there are   
 several stalls, including saddlers,   
 refreshments and gifts. The grass bank
 overlooking the course is usually     
 crowded with cheering spectators who  
 enjoy an odd gamble on the horses.    </content>
