		<content>    Her father worked on a farm and she
 had to help in the Easter and Summer  
 holidays.When her father chopped an   
 acre of sugar beet she had to follow  
 him on her hands and knees and single 
 them out so that there was only one   
 shoot left.Children earned their      
 pocket money by doing this.The school 
 hours 9am to noon and from 2pm to 4pm.
 She had to walk home at lunchtime as  
 school dinners were not provided.At   
 playtime,she joined her friends in    
 skipping games.As the house was near  
 the railway line,she remembers rushing
 out to watch the "Flying Scotsman"    
 ,the fasted train between London and  
 Edinburgh in the 1950s ,go by.She also
 used to wave to the Queen and other   
 members of the Royal Family on their  
 way to Sandringham ,Norfolk.At the age
 of 14 she went to  work in the        
 paper factory at Adelaide.            </content>
