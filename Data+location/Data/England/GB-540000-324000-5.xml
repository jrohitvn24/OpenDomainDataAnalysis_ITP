		<title>05FARMING IN THE GEDNEY AREA</title>
		<content> The farming in this aera is now all   
 arable. Many years ago farmers had    
 pigs and sheep which were taken down  
 the 'drove' roads to graze. All the   
 animals have now gone. The farmers use
 a lot of machinery and do not need    
 many helpers. Many of the hedges are  
 being removed to make bigger fields.  
    The main crops are potatoes,       
 wheat, sugar beet, and vegtables for  
 freezing and canning. Many flowers are
 grown in fields for their bulbs. The  
 farmers use a great deal of chemical  
 fertilizers and pesticides. Some      
 people are concerned about the long   
 term effect of these. Farms are       
 getting larger and when they are sold 
 they are often bought as investments  
 by pension finds and city Investments.
