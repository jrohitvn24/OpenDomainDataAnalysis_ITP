 Every{November}on the village green   
 there is a bonfire to celebrate{Guy   
{Fawkes'}night.                        
 Workmen take up the grass every year  
 from the green, then they start       
 building a{bonfire}by placing wood and
 other materials in an enormous heap.  
 During the celebrations there is a Guy
 Fawkes' model competition followed by 
 a {barbecue.                          
 The bonfire is lit at 6p.m. From the  
 barbecue people can buy{hot dogs, beef
{burgers and soup.}The fireworks begin,
 and are lit by adult members of the   
 village, for safety reasons. Fireworks
 such as{rockets, Catherine wheels,    
{fountains and Roman candles}light up  
 the black sky. The bonfire rages on   
 until late into the night. Eventually 
 the grass is replaced and the green is
 restored to its original state.       </content>
