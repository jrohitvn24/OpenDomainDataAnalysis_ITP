		<content> Composite Signals Organisation Station
 Morwenstow  is a Civil Service        
 department and a 'Government station  
 for research into satellite           
 communications'. It occupies crown    
 land on what was formerly Cleave farm 
 and was purchased in 1939 for use by  
 the army and later RAF to train       
 anti-aircraft gunners. The present    
 station was begun with the erection of
 two 150 feet high dish antennas. It   
 became operational in 1971/2 and has  
 since extended the complex to occupy  
 an 80 acre site with 7 variously      
 sized antennas and two more planned.  
 Besides being a major landmark and    
 tourist attraction, CSOS provides some
 employment for the indigenous         
 population, contributes greatly to the
 parish rates and ensures access to the
 A39 is maintained during winter       
 weather.                              </content>
