		<title>14The Bell Inn - Salhouse   2</title>
		<content> Beer for the Bell Inn was until very  
 recently, supplied by The Norwich     
 Brewery Company and was brewed in that
 city.The brewery has now closed with  
 the loss of jobs and beer is now      
 supplied from Manchester and          
 London.The Norwich Brewery signs will 
 stay on the Inn until 1988.           
 Like all good publicans, Mr Colman    
 runs a trouble-free inn and reserves  
 the right to refuse entry.He is unable
 to refuse entry to one 'person' and   
 that is the Inn's ghost who, apart    
 from a thud or two in the night, can  
 be heard playing darts at 6 o'clock in
 the morning.
