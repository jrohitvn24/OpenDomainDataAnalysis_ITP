     In the Finchdean engineering works
 we met Mr.Knight who had just received
 a new drill and he was using it for   
 the first time.                       
     It was a{computerised milling     
{machine}and it did not just drill     
 holes but it cut slits as well. There 
 was a lathe and another big drill.    
 There were tools and drill bits all   
 over the factory.                     
     They were making parts of a       
 machine that makes P.C.B's,that is    
{Printed Circuit Boards. }             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
