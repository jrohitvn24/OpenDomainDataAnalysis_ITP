		<content>The School Fete                        
The school fete was an enjoyable day   
we had a scene of country dancing also 
a fancy dress competition.             
this year we raised 1,500 pounds and   
we brougt a video for the school       
televison.The members of the PTA where 
very helpful and worked hard.          
The children from the school helped put
up the stalls and some of the mums and 
dads stood behind them.                
Fire at Station                        
In the early days of 1985 Goring       
station was burnt down by vandals. They
now have a little temporary tiket      
office where people buy their tickets  
from. The police looked for the        
vandals but only caught some of        
them.The tried to get the money out of 
the safe but they couldnt they were so 
fustrated that they set fire to the    
station.                               </content>
