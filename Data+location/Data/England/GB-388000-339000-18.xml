		<title>18THE DOUGLAS MACMILLAN HOME</title>
		<content>The Douglas Macmillan Home deals with  
patients who have cancer and need      
special care. The home is called a     
hospice which means resting place. The 
money raised to build the home was     
raised in Stoke-on-Trent. The home was 
built in such a position that it was   
not near a hospital, and would make the
patients forget hospitals. The home was
built in 1973 and was opened by        
Princess Alexandra. It was named after 
Douglas Macmillan who set up the fund  
after his father died of cancer. The   
staff at the home consists of a matron,
4 or 5 sisters, 4 staff nurses, 25     
auxillary nurses, domestic staff, 2    
cooks, drivers, 2 gardeners and 40 to  
50 volunteers who help but do not get  
paid. Altogether there are 28 beds, but
at the moment a new extension is being 
built for a few more beds. The Health  
Authority only give money for 15 beds. </content>
