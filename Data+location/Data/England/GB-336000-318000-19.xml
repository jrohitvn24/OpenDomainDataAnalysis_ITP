		<title>19PUB LIFE IN NESSCLIFFE CONT</title>
		<content> There is a lot of gambling - fruit    
 machines, dominoes, horse betting,    
 pool, darts and arguments. We have    
 just enough money to live on and are  
 not particularly well off.  We have   
 competition from The Three Pigeons,   
 another pub just down the road.  Mum  
 overworks and only has 1hrs sleep in  
 the afternoon when she is not         
 gardening and about 5 at night.  She  
 runs the bar and kitchen, helping Dad 
 and doing meals.  Dad normally sits in
 the bar arguing, serving, betting,    
 drinking and sorting out the          
 occasional fight.  Peak times are 8 -9
 at night and midday.  We sometimes    
 have coachloads for a meal.  The most 
 difficult thing is to get everyone out
 by lO.3O at night and a few are       
 normally still there by 1am. We rarely
 get into trouble with the police      
 though.                               </content>
