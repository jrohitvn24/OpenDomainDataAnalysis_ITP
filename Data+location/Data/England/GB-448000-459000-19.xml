		<title>19Ecology Newton/Linton</title>
		<content> The ecology is typical of rural       
 lowland.Trees,including sycamore,ash, 
 oak and chestnut are scattered over   
 the area,once covered by a Royal      
 Forest.Many hedges have been pulled   
 out and those remaining, hawthorn and 
 blackthorn,are slashed well back,so   
 destroying the habitat of wild life.  
 Modern methods of farming have killed 
 many wild flowers but bluebells,      
 primroses and Himalayan balsalm remain
 and wild flowers grow by the roadside.
 Resident birds include thrushes,      
 blackbirds,tits,robins and finches,   
 with swallows,martins,swifts and      
 cuckoos being summer visitors.        
 Fieldfares visit in winter.Flocks of  
 rooks wheel over the fields and tits  
 and finches are fascinating to watch. 
 Cock pheasants roam ploughed fields.  
 Rabbits and foxes are found and grey  
 squirrels live in the deciduous trees.</content>
