		<content>Skipwith Common is a disused second    
world war airfield, flanked by silver  
birch trees and dotted with standing   
water; a strange mixture of heather,   
bog, bracken, nettle, footpath and moss
green tarmac. The Common is owned by Mr
Nigel Forbes-Adams as part of his      
Escrick Estate.Bye-laws have safe-     
guarded the natural beauty of the      
Common. The Common has thus avoided the
heavy hand of modern farming methods.  
It is an island of uncultivated land   
surrounded by a sea of rich arable     
fields. The Common extends for around  
1,000 acres, 600 of which are included 
in the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust's      
Nature Reserve. The Trust's nature     
trail takes in two of the old airfield 
runways and passes Danes' Hill.
