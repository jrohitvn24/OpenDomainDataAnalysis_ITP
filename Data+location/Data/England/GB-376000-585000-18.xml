		<title>18Tarset Women's Institute</title>
		<content> At 63 years old, Tarset has 30 members
 and in spite of competition from TV   
 and other organisations, plays an     
 important role in the life of the     
 community.  We had had                
 talks/demonstrations on wine-making,  
 eating for health and beauty, flower  
 arranging, a film 'From Deadwater to  
 Bellingham', car maintenance, cooking 
 for a dinner party, the work of Hexham
 spinal unit and a foreigner's view of 
 her homeland.  In addition we have had
 a members' night which uncovered      
 hitherto unsuspected talents!  We have
 formed a darts team which plays       
 regularly and during the winter we    
 held keep fit and dance sessions in   
 the village hall.  Our president, Edna
 Waitt, a member of the Northumberland 
 Combined Arts sub-committee, studied  
 music at Denman College. Scty Helen   
 Tait was at AGM at Albert Hall.       </content>
