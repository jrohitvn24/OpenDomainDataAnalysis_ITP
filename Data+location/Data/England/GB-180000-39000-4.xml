  Most of the houses are modern.Some   
 are council houses and the people who 
 live in them pay rent.Many of them are
 detached bungalows and the people who 
 live in them own them.                
   I live in a house like that.I have a
{bedroom}of my own on the ground floor 
 with my parents.The{bathroom}is on the
 ground floor but we also have a{      
{shower}room at the back of the house  
 by the{visitor's}room.The{kitchen}is  
 in the same room as the{dining}room   
 and the {garage}is fixed onto the     
 house.                                
  My sister sleeps in the{loft}and has 
 a nice view of the garden.            
   The house is built of concrete      
 blocks covered with plaster and the   
 windows are double glazed.            
                                       
                                       </content>
