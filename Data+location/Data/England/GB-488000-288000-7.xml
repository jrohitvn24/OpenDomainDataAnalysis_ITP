		<content>Providing facilities which at present  
are only available in Northampton,     
Leicester and Peterborough, the new    
commercial development is likely to    
draw its users from a 15 to 20 mile    
radius of Corby. The plans have a      
provision for a new Corby rail link on 
the site, containing offices to help   
finance the scheme. Another link on the
transport chain would be the provision 
of a link bus between the station and  
the town centre.                       
The first jobs created will be in the  
development teams and the construction 
industry but it is hoped that there    
will also be a centre to provide       
training and real work experience for  
young people                           
The development is being headed by     
Erostin Developments.
