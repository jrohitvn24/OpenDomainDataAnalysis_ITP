		<title>17Soloman's Temple /Court Barn</title>
		<content> Soloman's Temple is the name of two   
 cottages on Werms Lane, locally known 
 as Teapot Lane. These seem to be      
 sarcastically named as they once      
 belonged to the church and were used  
 as parish poor houses.                
                                       
 Court Barn, probably dating back to   
 the early fifteenth century, is the   
 smallest of several surviving tithe   
 barns of Glastonbury Abbey. It has    
 five bays and walls are of coursed    
 rubble. The roof is of a 'base cruck' 
 construction. The tiled roof dates    
 from the 1930's when the National     
 Trust carried out repairs. The remains
 of a substantial dove cote may be seen
 on the east wall.
