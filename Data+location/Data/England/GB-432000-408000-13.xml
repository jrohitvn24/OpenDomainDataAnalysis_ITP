		<title>13ATHERSLEY SCHOOL THEFTS</title>
		<content> Out of fifteen schools in the         
 Athersley and Mapplewell area only two
 have not been entered. There has been 
 damage done inside at eleven of the   
 schools entered. Most damage has been 
 done to doors, but other school       
 property has been damaged. These      
 eleven schools have had equipment     
 stolen, the most expensive property   
 being videos, stereos and computers.  
 Smaller items have been stolen also.  
                                       
 Ten of the schools have had the       
 vandals caught. Measures taken to     
 deter vandals include alarm systems   
 and anti-vandal red paint. Some       
 schools are patrolled by a community  
 policeman. Caretakers who live by the 
 school are also a deterrent.
