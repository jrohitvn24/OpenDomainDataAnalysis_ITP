 The whole of Ally Pally is owned by   
 a  charitable trust and employs about 
 120 people.                           
                                       
 There are extensive plans for the     
 redevelopment of the main palace.At an
 estimated cost of Â£35 million the     
 palace wiil become a sophistiacted    
 leisure centre incorporating a hotel  
 ,exhibition halls, a sports complex   
 and a drama school.The first phase    
 will be opened in 1988, the remainder 
 finished in the 1990s.                
                                       
 It is hoped that Ally Pally will      
 continue to occupy a prominent role in
 the life of the locality,as it does   
 now.Indeed  on the quiet Thursday     
 morning we visited the Pally we       
 counted 187 adults and 49 children    
 using the facilities.                 </content>
