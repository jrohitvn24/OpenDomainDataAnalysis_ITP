		<content> Kings{New House Farm,}with 217 acres  
 of top and soft fruit and cereal, is a
 family concern, now in the 4th genera-
 tion. The farm was one of the first to
 join the East Kent Packers Co-opera-  
 tive. Adopting the North Holland      
 method, tree branches are tied down to
 check unnecessary growth and yield    
 more fruit. The "Pick your own" system
 is popular, customers often arriving  
 as a coach party. The large 17th cen- 
 tury farmhouse, supported entirely on 
 beams, was declared an Historic Build-
 ing of Kent in the 1970's, and bears  
 the red diamond-shaped plaque. In the 
 scullery is a well 190 feet deep. An  
 irrigation plant with 2400 gallon tank
 was installed in 1985. The two farm   
 workers' houses built in 1890 stand   
 beside the Bridleway which runs       
 through the farm to Larkey Valley.
