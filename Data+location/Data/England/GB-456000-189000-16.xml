		<content>{Cubs and Scouts} In 1985 the cubs have
no meeting place in Brightwell, and the
pack meets in North Moreton. We are    
busy fund raising to collect enough    
money to build a new hall for          
ourselves. During cub meetings we work 
for badges and play games.             
{Thursday Special} meets at the Free   
Church and is for younger children.    
It's great fun and we do a lot of      
different activities.                  
{Crusaders} also meet at the Free      
Church, and is for the teenagers of the
village.                               
There are all sorts of clubs for all   
ages of residents of Brightwell. The   
{Tennis club} is very active and is    
enjoyed by young and old.              
{The Community Association} exists to  
promote clubs and events such as the   
annual Village Fete as well as         
activities for young and old.          </content>
