		<title>17THE RIVER STOUR</title>
		<content> The river Stour, as it runs through   
 this area, is a{tidal estuary}over a  
 mile wide. It becomes tidal eight     
 miles upsteam from Parkeston, and     
 joins the{River Orwell}about one and  
 half miles downsteam. It is an        
 important{artery for shipping}being   
 dredged deep enough at Parkeston for  
 the large Continental ferries,and a   
 channel all the way to Mistley for    
 smaller vessels.                      
  It is a very{attractive}river flowing
 past some beautiful areas.It forms the
{boundary between Essex and Suffolk}and
 on both sides are farmland and        
 woodland. It is not possible to reach 
 the shore by car but the walk is well 
 rewarded by the peace and almost      
 unspoilt beauty of both banks.        
  The river itself is well used by     
 small{pleasure craft,}wind surfers    
 and the occasional Thames barge.      </content>
