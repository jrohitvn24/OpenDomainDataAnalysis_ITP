		<content> St. Peter's church is in a very poor  
 state of repair at the moment. An     
 appeal fund has been launched to raise
 money for repairs. Approx. Â£35,000    
 is needed to repair the tower and     
 belfry and Â£5,000 is needed to repair 
 the north east corner of the church.  
 Its organisations include a Sunday    
 School and Mothers Union. It shares a 
 minister with Helmdon and Radstone.   
 Local history tells us that the       
 Methodist church was built in 1860.   
 Its minister is part of the Banbury   
 Methodist circuit and services are    
 held at regular intervals. Repairs are
 also needed to this building. There is
 also a holiday club for the younger   
 children during the summer months. The
 playgroup use the Methodist school    
 room and meet twice a week. They      
 accept children from the age of three 
 years.                                </content>
