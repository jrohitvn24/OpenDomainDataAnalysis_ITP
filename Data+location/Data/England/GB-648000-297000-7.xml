		<title>07Lound Church</title>
		<content>The church of St. John the Baptist,    
Lound, was built in the 13th Century.  
The church in the past was busy. This  
does not seem to be the case today. The
church is visited by a lot of tourists 
in coaches.The church is like a museum.
People visit it for its font,rood      
screen and a modern painting of St.    
Christopher on the North wall. There   
aretoday only a couple of services a   
week and occasional weddings and       
christenings. There is a flower rota   
and a church cleaning rota. Collections
are made for the C.O.F.E.children's    
society and pension fund. On the day we
visited the church in June 1985,there  
was a notice announcing that Bishop    
Maurice Wood was retiring on the 26th  
August,the date of his 69th birthday.  
At the moment the church has two church
wardens,a secretary and a treasurer.   
Coffee mornings are held occasionally. </content>
