{Poisoned Glue.}                       
 This is how you play the game Poisoned
 Glue.  First you collect a group of   
 five children and choose one to be The
 Catcher.  The child who is elected to 
 be The Catcher spreads his/her fingers
 out and points to the poisoned finger.
 The other children now catch hold of  
 the fingers which are left.  The      
 Catcher says 'I went to the shops and 
 bought some poisoned chocolate/cream/ 
 beans'and so on.  When The Catcher    
 says 'I went to the shops and bought  
 some poisoned glue' the children let  
 go of The Catcher's fingers and run   
 away.  The Catcher runs after them and
 the first to be caught becomes The    
 Catcher.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
