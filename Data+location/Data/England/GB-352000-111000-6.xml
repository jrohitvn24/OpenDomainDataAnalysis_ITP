		<title>06HOUSING IN EAST COKER</title>
		<content>                                       
  East Coker is a very popular village 
 because of its proximity to Yeovil and
 the{character}of its buildings.Most of
 the houses are old,built of local     
{Hamstone with thatched or slate roofs.
 Many have been{converted}from a former
 use,for example Forge Cottage.        
                                       
{ House prices}are around the average  
 for the country;a new semi-detached   
 house would cost Â£35000  and an older 
 property from Â£50000 depending on its 
 age,position and character.           
                                       
  There are{two estates}of newer       
 housing at Mill Lane and Broadacres,  
 but not much new building is being    
 done at present.
