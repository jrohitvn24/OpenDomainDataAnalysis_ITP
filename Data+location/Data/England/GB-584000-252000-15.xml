months there have been: A Ballroom     
Dance,an artificial ice rink, which was
very popular, a Disco to the music of  
the 1950's &amp; 60's,a very large and well
organised Jumble Sale, a 50/50 auction,
some Country &amp; Western evenings and a  
Beetle Drive! Shimpling school hall is 
used for a ladies keep fit class run of
an evening during school term time and 
arrangements are in hand to start a    
Beavers Club (pre Cub Scouts) to also  
meet in the hall.  The Bush Inn at     
Shimpling has a Cribbage Team,Darts    
Team and at a moments notice will field
a football team or tug-of-war team for 
any local event. They also use the     
field to the rear of the pub  where the
Bury Buggy Club meet each Sunday       
morning (they are a model racing buggy 
club from nearby Bury St. Edmunds).
