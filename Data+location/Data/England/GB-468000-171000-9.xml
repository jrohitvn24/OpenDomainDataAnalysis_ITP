		<title>09FAMILY LIFE IN READING</title>
		<content> On Sunday I go to church in the       
 morning at 9.30.I have my breakfast   
 and get dressed.On my way back,I get  
 my sweets or sometimes my brother     
 takes me there.There is a shop down   
 the road.When it rains I invite my    
 friends to play but when it is sunny  
 my brothers and I play outside.In the 
 winter all my family go down to the   
 river on our sledge.In summer we      
 sometimes go to the seaside but one   
 day we went when it was raining and so
 we went in the arcade all day.Later it
 got nicer so we went to the shop to   
 buy some rock.We went swimming in the 
 pool which was good because there were
 lots of steps and it was warm.Then we 
 had to go home and I ate my rock.
