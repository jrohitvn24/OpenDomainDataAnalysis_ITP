		<title>04WEST HULL'S NEW TRUNK ROAD</title>
		<content>   THE M62 HAS, FOR YEARS FED ALL OUT  
 OF TOWN TRAFFIC INTO WEST HULL ALONG  
 THREE MAIN ROADS: ANLABY, BOOTHFERRY  
 AND HESSLE ROADS. MUCH OF THIS WAS    
 GOING THROUGH TO THE EAST.            
   A FEW YEARS AGO CONSTRUCTION BEGAN  
 ON A DUAL CARRIAGEWAY OUTSIDE HULL.   
 THIS IS NEARLY FINISHED, AND COMES    
 INTO W.HULL SOUTH OF ALL EXISTING     
 ROADS ALONG PREVIOUS DOCK AND RAILWAY 
 LAND AND VERY CLOSE TO THE HUMBER     
 ESTUARY. IT EVENTUALLY PASSES SOUTH OF
 THE CITY CENTRE.                      
   THE PLAN WAS TO REDUCE HEAVY TRAFFIC
 IN THE BUILT UP AREAS. BUT NOT        
 EVERYONE IS HAPPY. SOME TRADERS       
 HAVE OBJECTED TO THE PLAN TO BLOCK OFF
 PART OF THE MOST SOUTHERLY ROUTE:     
 HESSLE RD. DESIGNED TO FORCE TRAFFIC  
 TO KEEP TO THE NEW ROAD TRADERS ARE   
 FEARFUL FOR THEIR BUSINESSES.
