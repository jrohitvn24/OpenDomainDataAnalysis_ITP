		<title>10A day of my life</title>
		<content> My name is Leanne and I am ten years  
 old. I get up at 07.00 and have       
 breakfast of cereal, toast and a cup  
 of tea at 07.30. My Mum and Dad then  
 drive me to their place of work, where
 I wait until it's time to walk over to
 my School which is nearby. I get to   
 School at 08.40, meet my friends and  
 have a little chat. At 09.00 the      
 whistle is blown and we go into school
 to be registered. This is followed by 
 an assembly in the hall of all the    
 children. We have a story, a hymn and 
 prayers. Back in the classroom we do  
 work in Mathematics and Language.     
 There is a break at 10.45 and stop for
 dinner at 12 noon. Afternoon school   
 starts at 13.15 and ends at 15.30. I  
 watch some television in the evening  
 after learning my spellings and       
 tables. I put my cat in its box before
 I go to bed at 21.00.                 </content>
