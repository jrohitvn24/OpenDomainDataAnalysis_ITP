		<title>01S.E.Ashford and Great Chart</title>
		<content> This area is changing rapidly.It was  
 mostly farm land but the town of      
 Ashford is growing.It used to be a    
 small market town but now they are    
 building industrial and housing       
 estates.These are spreading out and   
 taking up the farm land.Two of our    
 schools are on new housing            
 developments,St.Simons and Godinton   
 Primary, and two in the village of    
 Great Chart,Great Chart Primary and   
 The Friars.Some people were born here 
 but more are moving in.The Army       
 Barracks accounts for some of this.   
 We have looked at the countryside,the 
 farms and the people around us and    
 have noticed the changes happening    
 now.It is still mostly a rural        
 area,with nice countryside,village    
 life in Great Chart,the old country   
 house at Godinton Park,the farms,but  
 this is under threat.                 </content>
