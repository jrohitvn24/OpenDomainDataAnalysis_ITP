		<title>03Long Marston Village Hall</title>
		<content> Some clubs in Long Marston meet in the
 village hall. Built in l926, on land  
 donated, its cost was raised by       
 villagers. A cleaner/caretaker is     
 employed by the elected committee.    
 Money for maintenance and renovation  
 is raised from events, a fete and     
 Gala. Regular bookings include Clubs  
 for Babies, Toddlers and Children,    
 Women's Institute and Bridge sessions.
 During the year jumble sales, private 
 functions, dances, parish council     
 meetings and presentations for the    
 Open Gardens Competition take place.  
 This hall, unlike Pebworth's, stands  
 between the shop and garage with no   
 land around it which may account for  
 the lack of vandalism.  The recently  
 renovated hall costs locals Â£l per    
 hour to hire, Â£5 per evening and Â£l0  
 all day.                              
                                       </content>
