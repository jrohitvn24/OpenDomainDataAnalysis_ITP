		<title>02SOLID GEOLOGY IN LAMLASH.</title>
		<content>    Lamlash is mostly composed of Dune 
 Bedded Sandstone and Breccia.These are
 sediments from the Permian age.The    
 secondary rock type is Crinatite with 
 some Teschenite sills.These are       
 igneous intrusions which came from the
 Tertiary age.These make up the higher 
 areas of Lamlash due to them being of 
 a more resistant rock type whereas    
 the dune bedded sandstone and breccia 
 are softer sediments which were eroded
 more easily .                         
   There are some scattered Felsite    
 dykes,sills and vent intrusions,the   
 most notable of these being Meall     
 Buidhe which reaches a height of      
 261metres.There are a number of small 
 thin dykes that are visible only on   
 the beach.These dykes are an extrusive
 rock,commonly known as Basalt.
