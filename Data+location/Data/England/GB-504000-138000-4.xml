		<content>   My name is Katherine McCann and this
 is a description of one day in my     
 life.I wake up at 7.30 and get out of 
 bed.Then I wash and get dressed.For   
 breakfast I have a bowl of cereal and 
 a piece of toast.Then afterwards I    
 clean my teeth.Then I get in the car  
 and my mum drives me to school.       
   When I get to school we go in to the
 hall for an assembly.After this we    
 have maths which is fractions.Then we 
 have playtime for 20 minutes.When we  
 come back in we have spellings,       
 meanings and sometimes SRA.That takes 
 me up to lunch time.After lunch I have
 group reading and that lasts for an   
 hour.After that we go by coach to     
 Cranleigh pool for a swimming lesson  
 until 3.30.Then I go home.At 4.45 I go
 to my tap dancing lesson.Then I will  
 go home and have my tea.At 7.30 I have
 my bath and then I go to bed.         </content>
