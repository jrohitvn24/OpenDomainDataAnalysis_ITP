		<content>   High unemployment in this densely   
populated area of the New Town is a    
feature of the area. Originally only   
people who had jobs in the New Town    
could get a house in the Town.         
   As a result of government subsidies 
many of the large factories (Industry  
1) became seriously overmanned. The    
closure of these led to severe un-     
employment - in 1983 44% male and 38%  
female - with no prospects. Wages are, 
on average, very low and require two   
wages for a decent standard of living  
and so there is a tendency for both    
husband and wife to work or both not.  
   One child wrote of his day:'I get   
up at 7-30 my dad has gone to work my  
mum is still at work my mum works on   
nights,' Another wrote:'My dad wakes up
and makes our breakfast then my mum    
gets up and they go to digmoor (Post   
Office) and get the money.'            </content>
