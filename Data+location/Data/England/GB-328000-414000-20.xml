		<title>20RED RUM</title>
		<content> Red Rum is the only race horse in     
 history to have won the Grand         
 National,a steeplechase,held in March 
 or April,about 4.5 miles long with    
 approximately 30 jumps,3 times in a   
 row.He did this in 1973 1974 and      
 1977.He is now 21  years old,and has  
 retired to Southport where he lives   
 with 25-30 other horses at his owners 
 stables.Every Sunday Wednesday and    
 Friday mornings Red Rum and the other 
 horses in Ginger McCaines care,go     
 cantering along Southport beach,as the
 salt in the water strengthens their   
 legs and the salt does not wear down  
 their shoes as much as stone.Red Rum  
 is a big celebrity in Southport,there 
 is a bronze bust of him in Wayfarers  
 Arcade,and he is open to the public at
 his stables 8 hours a day.He can      
 regularly be seen opening fetes and   
 galas.                                </content>
