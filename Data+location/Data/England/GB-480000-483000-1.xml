		<title>01The Thornton/Pickering Area</title>
		<content> The area consists of the gentle south 
 facing dipslope of the limestone{     
{Tabular Hills.}Cutting through in a   
 NE-SW direction is the deep,steep-    
 sided glacial overflow channel of{    
{Newton Dale.}The southwest corner     
 contains the modern residential and   
 industrial outskirts of{Pickering.}The
 southeast corner contains the majority
 of the village of{Thornton Dale,}which
 lies within the{North York Moors  }   
 National Park. Its population has     
 recently expanded with the influx of  
 retired people, and tourism has       
 developed as the village has become a 
 popular halt for coach trips. The area
 is extensively used for cereal farming
 with some land devoted to forestry and
 quarrying. Other employment comes from
 services,tourism,and light industry   
 which has been developed on a CoSIRA  
 estate on the outskirts of Pickering. </content>
