		<title>12Along a Wolverhampton Canal</title>
		<content>We walked along the Wyrley and Essing- 
ton canal in Wednesfield. We saw reeds 
in the shallow water and a few lilies  
in deeper water. We saw many trees in- 
cluding elder,hawthorn,sycamore and    
horsechestnut.We saw some minnows,pond-
skaters,leeches and watersnails.A water
vole was on the other bank,also eight  
ducklings and their mother.Nettles grew
on the sides of buildings and through  
mud where the towpath had been churned 
up. Brambles,grass and nettles survive 
best. Some people throw things into the
canal such as trolleys,bottles,a pram,a
gate and oil cans.There are signs too  
that people care for the canal.The cou-
ncil has made a small garden from the  
library to the canal. A bridge has been
painted green to match the natural sce-
nery. people have put flowers at the   
bottom of gardens by the canal.The can-
al wildlife is very interesting.       </content>
