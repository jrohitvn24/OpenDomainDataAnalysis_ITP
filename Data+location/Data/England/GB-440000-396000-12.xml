		<title>12Memories of old Rawmarsh</title>
		<content>    Rawmarsh Swimming Baths were built 
 on the site of Rawmarsh Hall in the   
 1920s. Less strenuous recreation was  
 provided by the{Rawmarsh Silver Prize 
{Band}and the 'Picture Theatres' where 
 'Flash Gordon' could be seen for one  
 penny.                                
    There was also the annual fair held
 during the third week in August on the
 Crown Inn field between Green Lane and
 Pottery Street where the present      
 Police Station is situated. Properly  
 called{Rawmarsh Feast Week,}people    
 tried to take their holidays then to  
 enjoy the stalls and games such as    
 hoopla, coconut shies and 'knell and  
 spur' competitions. There was a little
 stand where peas were sold and there  
 were donkey rides in a separate field.
    The feast week ended in 1936.      
 Smaller feasts and fairs continued to 
 be held but were not as popular.      </content>
