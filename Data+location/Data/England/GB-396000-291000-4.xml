		<title>04Tipton Wildlife</title>
		<content> Although Tipton is industrial in      
 character it has many animals.There   
 are many types of birds of which the  
 sparrow is probably the most          
 common.The starling is also           
 common.They flourish everywhere       
 feeding on seeds and scraps.Some not  
 very familiar birds are found like the
 magpie I have seen near Robert        
 Road.Kestrels can also be seen around 
 the area especially by the old railway
 and above the grass verges.Swifts and 
 swallows are found but they don't stay
 very long.                            
 Foxes can be found around             
 Tipton,usually on the Recreation      
 Ground by the old railway.There even  
 used to be foxes at Tipton            
 Station.Mice and bats are common      
 especially in old buildings.Water rats
 can be found by the canal.
