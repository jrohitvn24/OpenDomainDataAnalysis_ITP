		<title>02Living in Woburn.</title>
		<content> Our names are Lisa and Richard Smith  
 and we live in Woburn.We enjoy living 
 in Woburn because there is a swimming 
 pool at the other end of the village. 
 Our father works at Speedwell Farm    
 just up the road from where we live.  
 The farm is quite large. In the Summer
 we help with the harvest.             
 From our house we can see Woburn Abbey
 and in the distance you can see the   
 deer in the park. Our garden is quite 
 large with a cooking apple tree at the
 bottom.                               
 There is not a lot of industry in     
 Woburn, but behind the post office    
 there is the Drakeloe Press and by the
 recreation ground there is A.B.       
 Engineering.                          
 The town hall is falling down so some 
 residents have formed a committee to  
 build a new one. They hope to finish  
 it in 1986.                           </content>
