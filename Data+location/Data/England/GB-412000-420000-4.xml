      Koi Carp are ornamental fish from
 Japan and they come in sizes ranging  
 from tiddlers of a few inches long to 
 giants at nearly three feet.A local   
 man started like most enthusiasts by  
 keeping a few fish in a large tank in 
 his living room. He then began to sell
 a few to his friends; the trade grew  
 and he gave up his job to concentrate 
 on Koi Carp.                          
      Koi range in colour from shiny   
 silvery white ones to bright black red
 and white ones. The business started  
 in a disused church hall.Prices ranged
 from Â£5 for a few centimetres of fish 
 well up into four figures for a sixty 
 centimetre plus specimen.             
      The most expensive Koi he had for
 sale was Â£3,5OO but newcomers to the  
 hobby tended to spend up to Â£3O per   
 fish.                                 </content>
