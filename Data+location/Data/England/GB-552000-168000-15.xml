		<title>15Beechenlea Nursery:Swanley</title>
		<content>  We went to visit Beechenlea Nursery, 
the lady there was very kind and said  
that the gentleman we were going to see
knew everything about the nursery,as he
had been there 51 years.He told us that
 e grew 1 million bedding plants,      
chrysanthemums,and tomatoes every year 
and has 15 greenhouses.He let us go    
into the greenhouses,they were very    
hot.                                   
  The produce is sold to the public at 
Sevenoaks market,but this year has not 
been a good one for the crops.The      
nurseryman had a dog called Patty.     
  It was so hot that they gave us a    
drink before we got into the car.
