		<title>07CROOKHAM : GROVE FARM</title>
		<content> Grove Farm is a mixed arable farm     
 with a good frontage on to The        
 Street, Crookham Village.  This gives 
 excellent access to the farmland and  
 farm shop, which sells fresh produce. 
 The nearby granary is a listed        
 building and is of brick construction.
 This land has been used for growing   
 hops in the past, but is now primarily
 used for cereals and as a market      
 garden. A north eastern section of the
 farm consisting of 20 acres is        
 scheduled for the development of 200  
 residential homes. There is currently 
 considerable controversy as to which  
 of two access routes should be used   
 for the site.
