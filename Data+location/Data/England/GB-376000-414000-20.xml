		<title>20CONTRASTS IN RAMSBOTTOM AREA</title>
		<content> The area around Ramsbottom holds many 
 contrasts. Ramsbottom itself is a very
 close-knit community with much        
{industry}for its size and good        
 shopping facilities for every day     
 requirements. The surrounding         
 settlements are purely residential,   
 with no industry and limited shopping 
 facilities.                           
 The{population structure}of the area  
 also varies from settlement to        
 settlement. Ramsbottom has a larger   
 proportion of older people who live on
 their own than do the other           
 settlements. This can possibly be     
 explained by the fact that Ramsbottom 
 has more smaller cottages than do the 
 other places and these are ideal for  
 single occupants. Also the shops are  
 much closer to hand in Ramsbottom.The 
 other settlements tend to have a much 
 more{mobile population}than Ramsbottom</content>
