		<title>05RECTORY PARK SUTTON C'FIELD</title>
		<content> We{interviewed}eleven people and asked
 them questions about{Rectory Park. }  
   Seven people came to walk their dogs
 three people came for a stroll,and one
 visitor had come to watch a game of   
 cricket.                              
   Most people chose Rectory Park      
 because it is more convenient than the
 much larger{Sutton Park.}It is also   
 believed to be more peaceful and there
 is less litter strewn about.          
   Only two visitors thought the Park  
 wasn't{safe}and that was at night due 
 to gatherings of youths.Also there    
 have been some attacks on girls.      
   Everyone thought there were enough  
{amenities.}There are toilets which are
 vandalised but clean.The lock on the  
 Ladies toilet is on the outside!      
   The Pavilion is open to Sports Club 
 members and refreshments can be bought
 when there is a cricket match.        </content>
