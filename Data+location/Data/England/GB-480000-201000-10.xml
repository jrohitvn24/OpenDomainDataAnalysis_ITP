		<title>10FARMING NEAR PRINCES RISBOR;</title>
		<content>There is quite a variety of farming in 
this area, related to the geology.     
Where the chalk is capped by clay with 
flints there are damp pastures that    
support sheep and cattle.              
In the valleys there are deposits of   
alluvium and gravel which permit both  
cattle rearing and arable farming. Much
of the arable farming consists of barly
and wheat, but some oats is also grown.
The sheep are usually fed on           
concentrated foods and silage.         
A typical mixed farm in the area       
consists of eighty Jersey with a       
hundred or so young stock, and six     
Aberdeen beef calves. On the arable    
side there are a hundred acres of wheat
and about a hundred acres of barly,    
sometimes an acre or two of oats are   
grown. Five acres are given over to    
potatoes, twenty to silage and thirty  
to hay.                                </content>
