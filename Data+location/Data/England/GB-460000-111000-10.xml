		<title>10ENTERTAINMENT IN NEWTOWN</title>
		<content> The most popular form of entertainment
 is definetely the television; in a    
 small survey approximately.70%        
 admitted watching television often.   
 Outside of the home the most popular  
 "entertainment" was connected with one
 or more of the thirty organisations   
 existing in Soberton and Newtown.     
 Teenagers are less well catered for   
 and apart from the public houses most 
 go out of the village for their       
 entertainment. Portsmouth, Southampton
 and Chichester offer live concerts,   
 films and ballet.                     
 Rookesbury Hall is used mainly by the 
 Newtown Horticultural Society, Holy   
 Trinity Fellowship, Women's Institute 
 and the Dog Training School. Yoga     
 lessons are held periodically and it  
 is used for meetings by other groups  
 and for private parties. Town Cycling 
 Clubs use it during races at weekends.</content>
