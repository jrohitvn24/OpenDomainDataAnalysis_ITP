		<title>14Cutcombe Church.</title>
		<content> Cutcombe Church is very old although  
 some parts have been rebuilt when they
 have needed it. There are many        
 carvings on the stone pillars and also
 on the wooden choir stalls.           
                                       
 The tower is made of a different stone
 to the rest of the church and looks   
 very different inside.                
                                       
 There is a list of the names of the   
 men from the village who were killed  
 in the two World Wars.                
                                       
 Not many people go to the church as   
 there are not many people in the      
 village and visitors do not see it as 
 it is not near the main road.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
