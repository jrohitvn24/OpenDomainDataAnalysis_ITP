		<title>03A SCHOOL DAY</title>
		<content>  Giles Peplar is a fulltime headmaster
 with his own office. He talks with the
 staff &amp; sees to the post before going 
 to assembly. There he talks about     
 punctuality &amp; about the airdome sports
 hall that could fall down about any   
 time now. At break he cracks a few    
 jokes with the staff. From then on he 
 works on his own, doing paperwork &amp;   
 getting phone calls.                  
  Meanwhile at Chaucer the late bell   
 goes at 8.55am. If anyone comes to    
 school after that they have to go in  
 the late-book. We have Integrated     
 Programme all Monday morning. At break
 we sometimes play football with the   
 lads but we hardly ever get a kick of 
 the ball. At lunchtime there is a     
 cafeteria but usually I go to the chip
 shop or the bakery. We then have      
 Geography which is OK &amp; after break we
 have History which is fab.            </content>
