		<content>     The main areas of woodland in this
 block lie on the two escarpments      
 behind and to the east of the House.  
     Stand Wood is managed mainly for  
 amenity and has many pleasant walks.  
 There are many types of trees from    
 very young to very old.               
     At a higher elevation is Bunkers  
 Hill which is largely commercial      
 conifer plantings.                    
     There are several small woods in  
 the valley bottom to the west of the  
 House and the management here is      
 intended to produce visually pleasant 
 woods comprising mainly high quality  
 broadleaved trees also suitable for   
 pheasant shooting.                    
     There are eleven staff in the     
 Forestry Department who manage the    
 woods on traditional methods with up  
 to date equipment.
