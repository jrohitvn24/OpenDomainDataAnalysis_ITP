		<title>07A Typical Swallownest Family</title>
		<content> The Smiths werent born in Swallownest,
 they moved here because of the low    
 rates. They have 2 children are buying
 their semi-detached house &amp; rarely go 
 to Church. Their leisure time is spent
 in sport &amp; gardening. They both like  
 TV. He likes news &amp; sport &amp; she likes 
 soap operas. There are two wage       
 earners in the family. They both work 
 in Sheffield, he in a skilled job &amp;   
 she in an unskilled job. They have    
 been on holiday to Cornwall &amp; abroad  
 to Spain. They have a car &amp; spend up  
 to Â£10 per week on petrol. Mrs Smith  
 spends 20p per week on bus fares. They
 prefer Asda supermarket for their food
 &amp; Sheffield for non-food shopping.    
 They sometimes have a drink in the    
 pub, &amp;, like many other people, do not
 smoke.   They felt there was          
 inadequate provision in Swallownest   
 for teenagers.                        </content>
