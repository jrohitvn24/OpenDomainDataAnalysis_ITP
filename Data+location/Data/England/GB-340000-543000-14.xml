		<title>14INDUSTRY - FORESTRY</title>
		<content> The firm of Sheffields is based at    
 Broadfield, a large Georgian mansion  
 complex to the East of our sector. The
 business is in various forms of       
 forestry, locally and further afield. 
 The firm manages stands of timber     
 through all stages of their life, from
 planting to eventual clearing, with   
 economic dispersal of all wood        
 products involved.  Sheffields also   
 offers a small peripheral sales and   
 rental service of equipment used in   
 all branches of forestry.             
                                       
 Some casual labour is employed but the
 majority of the work is done by       
 full-time members of staff.
