		<title>17CUSTOMS</title>
		<content> There are very few local customs      
 peculiar to this area alone .Like much
 of Somerset there is an interest in   
{Carnival Processions}and{Skittling    
 which are two activities not found on 
 the same scale elsewhere in the       
 country.Carnival processions involve  
 the decoration of a large trailer or  
 lorry usually with lights ,noise and a
 tableau of "actors and actresses"who  
 will depict a scene such as a battle  
 or an activity such as a Kindergarten 
 at play.Each of these floats is       
 decorated and assembled by a carnival 
 club who will spend most of the year  
 in the planning and construction of   
 these floats.Many villagers were found
 to have been involved in these        
 activities at some time or other.The  
 carnival procession is also an        
 occasion to raise money for both local
 hospitals and charities.              </content>
