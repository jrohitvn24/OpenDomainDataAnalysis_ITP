		<content>This block includes the S.E. quarter of
The City of Lancaster, bounded on the  
East by the M6 Motorway. Beyond this,  
surrounded by farmland and fells is the
village of Quernmore. The narrow, steep
streets of small terraced houses in the
Moorlands and Primrose areas of the    
city contrast with the pleasantly      
landscaped estates of semi-detached and
detached houses of Newlands &amp; Bowerham.
Apart from the Ashton Memorial, which  
can be seen from many miles away, other
features of the urban landscape include
the Victorian facade of the Moor       
Hospital, the Cathedral spire, the twin
spires of Christ Church and the        
turreted buildings of St Martin's      
College-one of a number of educational 
establishments in the area. We have    
included details of some of the local  
iniatives aimed at improving ammenities
and prospects in the area.             </content>
