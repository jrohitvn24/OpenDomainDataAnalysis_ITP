 On December 13th 1981 there was a high
 tide and gale force winds. The sea    
 swept over the sea wall and into      
 nearby houses.                        
 On the morning of the 14th many people
 in Kewstoke and Sand Bay were         
 flooded.There was no entry to the     
 flooded area but from the Toll Road   
 you could see empty dinghies floating 
 around, sandbags by doors, pebbles on 
 wet roads and ruined gardens. The sea 
 had come half a mile  inland. In some 
 houses the water was a foot deep.One  
 old lady even had a cow in her living 
 room which came from a nearby farm.   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
