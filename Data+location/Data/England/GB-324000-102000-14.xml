		<content> There are many such houses in         
 Stockland.The Old Vicarage on the     
 Axminster Road is very attractive with
 a pleasing courtyard.The out buildings
 along with the house make up three    
 sides of a square.This is C18 having a
 slate roof &amp; being made of stone      
 rubble.The stables &lt;out buildings> are
 more likely C19.                      
 On the Honiton Road,Park Bridge,which 
 runs over a stream,is early C19 and   
 bears a plaque which reads:DORSET Any 
 person wilfully injuring any part of  
 this County Bridge will be guilty of  
 felony and upon conviction liable to  
 be transported for life" Note         
 Stockland used to be part of Dorset.  
 Opposite the King's Arms,there are    
 four C19 terraced cottages namely     
 Peartree Cottage,Ivy Cottage,Rose     
 Cottage and Farndale Cottage.
