		<content>    We saw an amusment arcade and some 
 vidio shops as well as a closed down  
 cinema one of four that have closed   
 down in the last twenty years leaving 
 only the Odeon left open.             
   The centre of town now has 3 indoor 
 shopping centres, with most of the big
 stores in them. Many of the roads have
 been closed to traffic and paved over.
   The group noticed some bingo halls  
 where many people go for              
 entertainment, and a new art gallery  
 called the Cleveland gallery which has
 over 9,000 visitors a year to its 6   
 exhibitions.                          
   Also in the survey area is Ayrsome  
 Park, home of Middlesbrough football  
 club.
