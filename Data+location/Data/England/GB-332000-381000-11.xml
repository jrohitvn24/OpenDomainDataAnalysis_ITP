		<title>11MYTHS AND LEGENDS</title>
		<content> Sightings have been reported on       
 Dibbinsdale Hill of a nun who died in 
 Poulton Hall while travelling to the  
 local nunnery. She supposedly waits by
 the roadside but vanishes when        
 approached. Another legend concerning 
 Dibbinsdale Hill is about a headless  
 nun. The story runs that the nun was  
 travelling from Birkenhead Priory to  
 Chester Cathedral. She sought shelter 
 in the house of the Lancelyn_Greens.  
 One of them demanded that she         
 surrender her virginity or perish. She
 refused and was locked away to starve 
 to death. In the last reported        
 sightings she vanished.               
       A cyclist was killed about 35   
 years ago on Dibbinsdale Hill. Her    
 brakes failed and she rode to her     
 death. Her ghost is said to trace her 
 route to this day.
