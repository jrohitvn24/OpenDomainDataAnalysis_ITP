		<title>14Port trade</title>
		<content> Imports into the southern end of the  
 port include fertilizers, woodpulp and
 oil for the power station, soon to    
 close, and the BP and Shell Mex       
 depots. Exports are of general cargo  
 in particular and associated with the 
 ferries. On average about 20 to 30    
 ships enter and leave daily, of which 
 perhaps half will be supply boats for 
 the North Sea gas rigs, 3 are roll-on 
 roll-off ferries and the rest cargo   
 boats. The ferries operate especially 
 to Scheveningen and carry Norfolk Line
 trailers and a few cars and           
 passengers. A small number of inshore 
 fishing boats, mostly undecked,       
 operate in the immediate area catching
 shrimps and longshore herring. The    
 port tug, Hector Reade also berths    
 within the area of the survey.
