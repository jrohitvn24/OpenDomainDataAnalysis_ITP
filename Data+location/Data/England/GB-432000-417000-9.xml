		<title>09Comparing Two Estates</title>
		<content> The following data was co-ordinated   
 following the completion of a         
 questionnaire by adults from 50 homes 
 on a Suburban Estate{(Thornes Moor    
{Road)}and 50 homes on an Outer City   
 Council Estate{(Portobello).          
   On both estates the population      
 surveyed was 100% British born. There 
 was no appreciable difference in age  
 structure. On the suburban estate all 
 houses were owner-occupied with hot   
 water, bath, W.C., cooker, fridge,    
 washer, T.V., vacuum and central      
 heating. 88% owned a car, 94% a       
 garage, 80% a freezer, 46% a food     
 processor, 32% a micro-wave oven and  
 36% owned video recorders. 78% of     
 those employed worked in Wakefield. Of
 those employed 73% were engaged in    
 professional, managerial, skilled or  
 non-manual occupations.  Only 2% were 
 unemployed.                           </content>
