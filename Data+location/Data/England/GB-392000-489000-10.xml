		<title>10HILL FARMING (SHEEP)</title>
		<content> The main occupation is sheep farming  
 and the most popular sheep is not, as 
 might be supposed, the Wensleydale,   
 but the Swaledale and various local   
 crosses with the Dalesbred and        
 Blue-faced Leicester coming close     
 behind.                               
 Lambing is late, taking place mainly  
 in April. The lamb sales are held in  
 September and the main market is the  
 Hawes Auction Mart, four miles to the 
 west.                                 
 Shearing takes place in July and the  
 majority of the wool is transported to
 the mills of South Yorkshire,         
 particularly Bradford.                
 The hardest times of year for the     
 sheep farmers are lambing when the    
 weather is seldom Spring-like and     
 mid-winter when fodder must be carried
 out into the fields or onto the fells.
