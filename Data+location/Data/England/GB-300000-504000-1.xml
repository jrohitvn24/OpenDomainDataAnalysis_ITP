		<content>  Our area is situated on the N.W.     
coastal strip of Cumbria. To the West  
is the Irish Sea, with the Isle of Man 
visible most days, while to the East   
are the Lake District Mountains with   
Scafell Pike dominating the skyline.   
  The whole area was affected by the   
Great Ice Age and as a result the soils
are predominantly boulder clays. The R.
Ehen traversing the area has deposited 
fertile alluvium over the centuries,   
consequently the area has good pasture 
and arable land. The low lying boggy   
coastal areas provide rough grazing.   
Dairy cattle are the dominant live     
stock while cereal crops are           
extensively grown.                     
  The climate is mild - Winter average 
2 Celcius, Summer average 18 Celcius.  
This is attributed to the effect of the
sea which reduces the severity of the  
winters.                               </content>
