		<content> The tenant of Worden Park Cottage has 
 lived there for the past ten years.The
 house came with the job of Park Warden
 although she has recently changed this
 to become a dog handler.She has two   
 dogs of her own which have won many   
 prizes.Her hobbies are,all sports,    
 attending dog shows and walking her   
 dogs around the park.There are only   
 three houses in the park and all are  
 very old.Two of them come with        
 working for the council.Living in the 
 park has its disadvantages.She often  
 gets pestered by people asking for    
 directions to facilities in the park  
 and it is about a mile to the nearest 
 shop.She enjoys living there and      
 intends to stay until thrown out by   
 the council.
