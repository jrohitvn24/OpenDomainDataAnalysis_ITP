		<title>11LIFE STYLES(1)CALCOT,READING</title>
		<content>    Life styles in Calcot differ       
 greatly in degree.Some families being 
 able to enjoy a high standard of      
 living,whilst others are only just    
 able to exist.                        
    Much of the modern world centres   
 young people,especially with fashion. 
 A decade or two ago,fashions were     
 aimed at young people in the 20 or 30 
 year age group.Today fashions are     
 aimed at the teenage market.          
   Consumer goods are also aimed at the
 young market.Teeagers in the Calcot   
 area can be seen walking down the     
 street carrying their casette-radios, 
 the sound audible for all to          
 hear!Almost all young people are into 
 pop(ular) music.                      
   Young girls today will be seen      
 wearing the make-up of their favourite
 pop star.Make-up is often quite       
 heavily used,especially by 'punks'.   </content>
