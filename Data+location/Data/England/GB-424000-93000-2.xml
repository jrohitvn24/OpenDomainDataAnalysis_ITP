		<title>02Local History In New Milton</title>
		<content>  Our area has been inhabited since the
{Old-Stone-Age}about 10,000 years ago. 
 Some flint hand-tools were found in   
 the gravel pits just beyond the far   
 end of our school field and in the    
 school drive. Polished flints were    
 found at{Golden Hill}dating from the{ 
{New-Stone_Age}(4000-2000 BC). Burial  
 urns half a metre tall dating from the
{Bronze-Age}(1000-500 BC) were found.  
  Five local places were mentioned in  
 the{Domesday Book}of 1086. Their place
 name derivations are as follows:
