		<title>02SOUTH CERNEY ARMY CAMP</title>
		<content> South Cerney Army Camp occupies 367   
 acres of land. As the camp was        
 originally built in 1935 as a R.A.F.  
 Flying Training School, it also has an
 airfield which takes up 200 acres.    
 There is no permanent runway as it is 
 a grass airfield, and is still used by
 No.625 Volunteer Gliding Squadron. In 
 1971 South Cerney was taken over by   
 the Army, and is the headquarters for 
 the 29 Transport and Movements        
 Regiments of the Royal Corps of       
 Transport, and also No.2 Postal and   
 Courier detachment of the Royal       
 Engineers. Although 300 people work on
 the camp, it can accommodate 3,000    
 when necessary in its role in troop   
 movements.
