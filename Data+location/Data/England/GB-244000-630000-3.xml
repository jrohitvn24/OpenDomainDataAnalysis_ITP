		<content> Very few bulls are kept. Some farmers 
 do artificial insemination others have
 visiting inseminators. Grassland is in
 premanent pasture or short term leys. 
 Conserved as silage or hay. Barley is 
 grown, tower stored for cattle        
 feeding. Hedges are of hawthorn and or
 beech. The fences are posts and wire. 
 Land is varies, light, medium and     
 heavy loams. There are benefits from  
 the effect of the Gulf Stream, snow   
 seldom lies. 1985 has been the worst  
 summer on record, with a devestating  
 effect on crop conservation and stock 
 management. Doom indeed. Tractors and 
 tractor mounted machinery used is for 
 ploughing, cultivating, haymaking,    
 silage making. Combine harvesters for 
 grain crop. A hedge cutting machine   
 is used for hedges, slurry and manure 
 spreaders for dung.
