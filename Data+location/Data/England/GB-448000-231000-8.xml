		<title>08 AYNHOE PARK HOUSE</title>
		<content>   Aynhoe Park House is owned by the   
Mutual Household Association and is    
used as flats. It used to be owned by  
the Cartwright family until the late   
1950s.                                 
   It is the biggest building in Aynho 
and dominates the village. It is built 
in the classical style and consists of 
3 wings around a central courtyard. It 
is built out of stone.                 
   To the south there was a large {DEER
PARK} but this has now been turned over
to agriculture. Separating the house   
from the park is a sunken ditch known  
as a ha-ha.                            
   In the grounds is a well preserved  
{ICE HOUSE}. This is a brick lined pit 
in the ground where ice from the canal 
was stored during the summer.          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
