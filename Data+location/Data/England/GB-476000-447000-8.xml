		<content> ECOLOGY;  ALLERTHORPE COMMON.         
 Large area of uncultivated unfarmed   
 land with natural abundant growth.    
 Patches of Willow Herb, Heather,      
 Gorse,Broom, Bracken and undisturbed  
 nettles. There is Lichen on the ground
 and around the base of the trees,     
 coarse grass(reed like), the ground   
 becomes very wet in places if         
 pressure applied. There is evidence of
 rabbits and moles. The bramble bushes 
 are full of unripened fruit. Besides  
 one of the public footpaths is an     
 apple tree, it has grown to a height  
 of approx.7ft.,and the apples though  
 not yet ripe looked free from disease.
 The Common is an area where foxgloves,
 &amp; yellow Rod grows wild. In spite of  
 the crop spraying which has taken     
 place around the common the ox-eye    
 daisies and poppies still border the  
 paths.                                </content>
