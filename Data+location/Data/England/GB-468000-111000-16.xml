		<content> The{oil well} is in a field belonging 
 to {Pyle Farm}to the south of the     
 Rowland's Castle Road. They received  
 Planning Permission in October 1982   
 and started work in November. The     
 actual drilling began in December and 
 oil was struck in January 1983 at     
 about 5000 ft. A nodding donkey was   
 installed in February. Production is  
 expected to last for about 10-15 yrs. 
 Further investigation and testing is  
 still going on. Three new appraisal   
 wells have been drilled, one of which 
 is near Dell Piece and called{Horndean
{B.}Banks and trees screen and reduce  
 most of the noise of the well. In the 
 field they have a pump and storage    
 tanks. They have also made an access  
 road. One corner has been realigned to
 ease cultivation. The outer sides of  
 the bank have been planted with native
 deciduous shrubs and trees.           </content>
