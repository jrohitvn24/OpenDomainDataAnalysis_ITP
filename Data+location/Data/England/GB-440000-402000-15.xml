		<content>    The houses are all lined up in     
 groups of four. At the back is a yard.
 Not all the houses have gardens.      
    Most of the houses now have        
 extensions, as in the old days they   
 had to share a toilet in the yard.    
 There are about 50 houses in Pitt     
 Street, 1 church and 2 pubs. Across   
 from the pit is a farm, which has 2   
 fields, in which they keep cows.      
    There are paths leading to the     
 allotments. The houses are about 100  
 years old. The houses have two        
 bedrooms, a front room, dining room,  
 kitchen and bathroom. The rooms are   
 big and high, and are heated by a coal
 fire.  When the fire has been alight  
 for a few hours the walls all begin to
 get hot.                              
    I was born in this house, before   
 that my family lived in Wombwell.
