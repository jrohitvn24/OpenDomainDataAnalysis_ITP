		<title>08KENNET YOUTH CLUB, THATCHAM.</title>
		<content> In this area the only youth club is at
 the Kennet Secondary school. It costs 
 25p to attend, is held on Monday and  
 Wednesday nights with about 90        
 children attending each night with    
 more in the winter. Each member is    
 expected to join in an activity like  
 badminton or cookery. There will be a 
 disco on June 5th, a staff versus     
 members rounders match on June        
 12th, and a Mr and Miss Kennet youth  
 club contest on June 19th. On 26th, a 
 sponsored Treasure Hunt will be held  
 to raise money for guide dogs. Ice    
 skating on July 3rd, swimming at      
 Newbury July 10th and an end of term  
 disco.                                
  More clubs are needed in this        
 area especially for 10 and 11 year    
 olds. The school is to have an indoor 
 swimming pool but we feel Thatcham    
 needs a swimming pool of its own.     </content>
