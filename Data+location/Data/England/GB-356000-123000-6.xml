		<title>06A DAY IN THE LIFE OF MR NASH</title>
		<content>    After a breakfast of cereal, egg   
 and toast, I travel about 8 miles to  
 Westlands Helicopter Co.in Yeovil.    
 I clock in by 8.30am. My job as an    
 avionic instalation designer involves 
 the use of computers.It is an         
 interesting job and covers all aspects
 of design, from wiring diagrams,      
 drawing up cable assemblies and the   
 mechanical design and integration of  
 systems into helicopters.I prepare    
 work for other engineers,supervise it 
 and finally check it.                 
    Lunch break is between 1.00pm and  
 2.00pm when I eat a packed lunch of   
 sandwiches.I leave for home at 5.00pm.
    Following tea, which is usually a  
 cooked meal of meat and vegetables, I 
 usually work in the garden until      
 dusk.Then I relax in front of the     
 television until bedtime.
