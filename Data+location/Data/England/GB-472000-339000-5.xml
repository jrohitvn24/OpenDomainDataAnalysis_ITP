		<title>05THE POST OFFICE</title>
		<content> In our village we have a small Post   
 Office. Our  Post Office maybe only   
 small but it is very very useful. The 
 shop sells bread, sweets and          
 cigarettes. It also sells different   
 types food most of it is tinned food. 
 They also sell the usual things like  
 ice lollies and even tights. The post 
 is delivered twice a day. In the      
 morning it comes by train from        
 Nottingham in the afternoon it comes  
 by a van and it's delivered by hand to
 Whatton,Aslockton and Scarrington.    
 There is no post on Sundays and only  
 one on Saturdays. Although the        
 Post Office is afood and sweet shop it
 is mainly used for stamps and         
 pensions plus faimly allowances.It    
 is used alot and is very busy each    
 day. On a Sundays and Saturday        
 afternoons it is closed.
