		<title>04Some changes in Beckermet</title>
		<content>Beckermet has grown enormously over the
past 50 years. Several small private   
housing estates have been built round  
its perimeter. If new people didn't    
come into the village, there wouldn't  
be a village. If too many people came  
into the village, it would lose its    
village aspect and start looking like  
a town. The new road has improved the  
village. Now, as there is not much     
traffic, Beckermet is a safer place.   
There was a railway in Beckermet with 5
trains a day to Whitehaven. The railway
was opened in 1869 and closed in 1964  
because of competition from the buses. 
There was a telephone in 1889. The     
first public telephone box was on the  
Millfields but then it was moved to the
park in the centre of the village      
because it was getting vandalised.
