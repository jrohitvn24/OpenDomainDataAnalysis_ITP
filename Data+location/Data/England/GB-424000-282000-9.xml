		<title>09Meriden-Buildings.</title>
		<content> Meriden contains several old buildings
 of particular interest, the majority  
 of them are situated away from the    
 present centre of the village and are 
 clustered around the Church about a   
 mile away on high land to the         
 south-east just outside our area.     
 These buildings form the{Meriden Hill 
{Conservation Area.}                   
                                       
 Within the village itself lies{The    
{Bulls Head Inn, }which is now a       
 restaurant. It was formerly a coaching
 inn on the main Birmingham to Holyhead
 road, and was used as a staging post  
 for changing horses before the climb  
 up Meriden Hill.                      
                                       
 There are also several thatched       
 properties to be found in and around  
 the village.
