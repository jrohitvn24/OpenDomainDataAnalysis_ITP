		<content>{ Heavy traffic}in York causes problems
 with fumes,noise,vibration and damage 
  to buildings.Parking is difficult.The
 easiest way to get around York is by  
 bicycle.There are several{bridges over
{the river},Ouse,Lendal,Skeldergate,   
 Scarborough and Clifton.Trains have   
 used Scarborough Bridge since         
 1845.Clifton Bridge is the most       
 recent,built in 1963 to take traffic  
 away from the city centre.(Before then
 there was a ferry over the river.)In a
 non busy period, 871 vehicles passed  
 in half an hour.                      
{York Railway Station}was built before 
 the First World War but was soon      
 bombed and quickly repaired.It formed 
 an important part of the  Great       
 Eastern Railway.York was and still is 
 one the biggest and busiest station in
 Great Britain with sixteen            
 platforms and an information centre.  </content>
