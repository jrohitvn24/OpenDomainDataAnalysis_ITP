shire,Northamptonshire,Berkshire and   
Hertfordshire can be seen from Brill.  
A windmill sits on a hill 615ft.high.It
is a post mill and was once used for   
grinding barley and corn.It is open to 
the public from April until the end of 
September from 2 to 5pm.on Sundays.    
Another windmill which used to stand   
on North Hills was struck by           
lightning in 1905.This year people in  
Brill are celebrating the tercentenary 
of the windmill with a 2 day faire.    
Brill has several interesting listed   
old buildings including 18c.vicarage   
and Brill House,16c.manor house and    
19c.Waterloo House.None are open to    
the public.The windmill sails are      
turned twice a year and it is looked   
after by the County Council.The last   
major repair was in 1975 when the      
sails were renewed and shortened.      </content>
