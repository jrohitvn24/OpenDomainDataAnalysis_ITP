		<content> There is a stream which goes into     
 Tiverton and there are lots of farms  
 around this little area. The cars have
 to go through the stream to go along  
 the lane.There is a bridge, for       
 people, which goes across the stream. 
 It is made of wood. Just beside the   
 stream there are three horsechestnut  
 trees.They have conkers on them and   
 are very big and old.There are old    
 houses and newer ones in Chettiscombe.
 There is a great big barn by the      
 stream. It looks very old. It is made 
 of stone,like some of the houses in   
 the area.I could not see very many    
 cars about because it is not a main   
 road.It is a country lane which is    
 only used by the local people.I saw   
 some sheep coming along the lane.They 
 went into  field.The farmer had two   
 dogs helping him to move the sheep    
 from one field to the other.          </content>
