		<content>{LIVING ON KING ARTHURS WAY            
 On the estate there is some trouble   
 and{vandelism.}Most of the houses on  
 King Arthurs Way have had to be       
{rebuilt}because of construction       
 problems. There should be more shops  
 on the estate as Andover town centre  
 is about 2 miles away. The estate     
 should not get too much like a town.  
 This is the opinion of an{old}lady.   
                                       
 The estate is convenient for mothers  
 with small children with enough shops 
 for every day needs. There is too much
{vandelism}in the area. The bus service
 to{Andover}town centre is good but    
 rather expensive. This is the opinion 
 of a{young}mother.
