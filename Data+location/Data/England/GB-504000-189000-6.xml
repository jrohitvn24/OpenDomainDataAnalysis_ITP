		<title>06HAREFIELD HEART HOSPITAL</title>
		<content> This hospital was founded in 1915 for 
 Australians wounded in the First World
 War.In 1937 a sanitorium was built for
 the treatment of TB patients. Today it
 has become world famous for heart     
 transplant operations as well as      
 thoracic surgery.Between 130 and 140  
 beds are available,with 40 for        
 geriatric patients and others for the 
 treatment of general illnesses.       
 The hospital gets a National Health   
 Service grant of 7.5 million pounds   
 per year and has treated a number of  
 famous people, including the late     
 comic Eric Morecombe. Although the    
 grounds of the hospital cover some 60 
 to 70 acres plans are afoot to sell   
 some of the land in order to raise    
 further funds.within the next ten     
 years a new building programme will   
 have significantly increased its      
 capabilities.                         </content>
