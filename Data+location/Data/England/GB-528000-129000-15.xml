{Tractors}are the vehicles that do the 
 main work on the farm apart from the  
 people.It can carry loads of different
 kinds of ploughs for ploughing and    
 furrowing.There are two kinds of hay  
 bales:round and square.THe tractor    
 goes round the field with either a    
 round or square baler and the baler   
 lays the bales out on the field.There 
 is rivalry between the different      
 farms with different makes of tractor.
{Combine harvesters }are things that   
 separate the corn heads from the      
 stalks.They have blades at the front  
 of them and are very big.They are     
 dangerous and can chop rabbits into   
 pieces so you must keep out of the way
 while they are at work.
