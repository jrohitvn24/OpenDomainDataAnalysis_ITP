		<content>We have 2 mixed  Primary Schools taking
pupils aged 5-9 yrs.Both schools were  
built in the late 1800's and currently 
have approx. 40 pupils on roll each,two
teachers,one of which is a teaching    
Head and 1 part time teacher working 1 
morning a week to enable the Head time 
for admin.work. Each school serves it's
own village and surrounding area. The  
children living outside the village are
transported by coach, provided by the  
local Education Authority.School hours 
are 9am-12noon lunch 1.10-3.10pm.Each  
school wears a uniform of blue &amp; grey, 
although not compulsory,majority are   
pleased to conform &amp; Parents are satis-
fied.During the Summer Term the schools
use a small outdoor swimming pool at   
another neighbouring school,they are   
taken by coach two mornings a week.    
These lessons are popular,and a very   
high percentage learn to swim.         </content>
