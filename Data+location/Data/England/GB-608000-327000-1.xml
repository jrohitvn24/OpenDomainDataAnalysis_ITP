 There are five arable farmers, 1 pig  
 farmer.  All farms are intensive      
 arable.  Crops grown are wheat,       
 barley, sugar beet, potatoes.  New    
 crop grown more is oil seed rape used 
 in margarine.  Fields are very big -  
 40 acres or more to accommodate big   
 tractors, combines, and other         
 implements in the 1980's less people  
 work on the land because one big      
 machine can do the work of many men.  
 There are 6 fulltime men on the 5     
 farms, some casual work at harvest    
 time.  No hedges left to preserve wild
 life.  Soil varies from light to      
 meduim.  4 small areas of woodland.   
 Some new trees have been planted.  The
 landscape is mostly flat.  a disused  
 railway line runs through Thurning    
 also the rivers Bure and Blackwater.
