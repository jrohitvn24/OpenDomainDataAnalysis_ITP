		<title>17CREST HOTEL, LANGLEY GREEN</title>
		<content> On a visit to the{Crest Hotel, Gatwick
{Airport}(not actually at the airport!)
 the pupils were shown around.         
 "We went to the{laundry.} They had 7  
 ladies and they had to wash 600 sheets
 a day. We went past all the{offices.  
 There were about 20. In a{bedroom     
 there was a colour TV, video, tea and 
 coffee maker, trouser press and       
 private bathroom. In the{Executive    
{Suite}there was a really posh jacuzzi.
 On the way to the{restaurant}we found 
 an automatic shoe polisher. We also   
 visited the{Bridge Bar}(for non-      
 alcoholic drinks!)."                  
{Crest Hotel}was the first, and now the
 largest 3-star, Gatwick hotel:{230    
 beds,{159}staff, including 11 chefs.  
 In theory{177268}guests could be      
 accomodated a year. Guests come from  
 all over the world: USA,Canada,Uganda 
 and Philippines, for example.         </content>
