		<content> A couple of weeks before Christmas, on
 the grass  near the library, the      
 Council put up a big Christmas Tree.  
 We have a crib put up later by the    
 Ratepayers'  Association. The crib has
 some animals in it and Mary,Joseph and
 Jesus, and some hay. When it comes to 
 Christmas Eve about 400 people gather 
 round the tree to sing carols.  The   
 Vicar from St.Catherine's Church says 
 all the prayers. There is always a    
 brass band to accompany the singing.  
 Altogether it is a very nice evening. 
 Another custom is the annual Rose     
 Queen Festival. It is a happy occasion
 when the Rose Queen and other children
 in beautiful costumes and dresses     
 parade round the roads accompanied by 
 a band. The Queen is crowned at       
 St.Catherine's Church and then there  
 is a party for everyone.
