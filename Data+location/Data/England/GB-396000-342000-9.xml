		<title>09The Local Sub-Post Office.</title>
		<content>   The small sub-post office provides  
the only shop within a two mile radius.
Every family in the village will have  
some cause to visit a least once a week
to obtain the family allowance or      
collect ones old age pension.          
   Two collections of post are obtained
he counter each day. That in the       
morning being taken to Normacot in the 
Potteries, that in the afternoon to    
Cheadle. Collection and delivery is by 
van, for the area covered is large,    
with many small farms. Delivery on foot
would take too long.                   
   The post office is run by Mr.&amp; Mrs  
Dale, a family that have lived in the  
the village for many years. Mr. Dales  
father ran the P.O. in 1914. Many      
years ago on entering the shop you     
could purchase your grociers too, but  
now you would have to visit Hanley or  
Cheadle. Half day closing is Thusday.  </content>
