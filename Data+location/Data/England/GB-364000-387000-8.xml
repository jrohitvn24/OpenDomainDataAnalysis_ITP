		<title>08CHURCHES: STATHAM/WOOLSTON</title>
		<content>   At the South Western edge of our    
 area lies the Roman Catholic church of
{St. Winifred, Statham.}This small     
 church with no tower or spire was     
 built in 1933. It has a beautiful     
 mosaic over the front door. Inside the
 church can be seen several paintings  
 and some lovely pictures of the       
 stations of the cross.                
                                       
   To the North is a second Catholic   
 church, that of{St Peter, Woolston.}  
 Opened in 1835 it is this year        
 celebrating its 150th anniversary. The
 church has been on the same site      
 throughout its existence at first     
 surrounded by fields now by suburbs.  
 In 1974 the outside of the church was 
 refaced with a sturdy white dressing  
 and this year it has been decorated   
 inside and reordered.
