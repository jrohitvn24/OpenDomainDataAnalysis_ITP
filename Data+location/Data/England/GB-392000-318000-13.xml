		<title>13Bednall Village.</title>
		<content>  On the outskirts of Bednall Village  
is Bednall Villa.  This large villa has
a small caravan site built into the    
garden.  There are 3 caravans there    
with built-in hot and cold water as    
well as flushing toilets.              
  Next to this is a disused well and   
stream surrounded by hilly farmland,   
sometimes wooded.  This is used for    
cattle grazing.  There are two farms,  
Southall's which is arable and Lower   
Farm which has battery hens and cattle.
  Bednall church dates back to the 13th
century.  The church clock is rewound  
every Sunday.  A group of 8 council    
houses built in 1940's stands in front 
of the church.  They have trouble with 
flies from the chicken farm next door. 
Most other houses in the village are   
modern except the mansion.  The village
shop includes a post office and general
store.                                 </content>
