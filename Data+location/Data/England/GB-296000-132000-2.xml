		<content> Although much of the land is rough    
 grazing a certain amount has been     
 reseeded to improve its quality.      
 In fact we found one complete valley  
 where a number of acres had been      
 resown earlier this summer.           
                                       
 Some of the hedges, particularly those
 along the road sides have been allowed
 to grow tall to protect the fields    
 from the strong westerly winds.       
 However other hedges have been lopped 
 to the ground with only a small amount
 of pleaching along the top of the soil
 banks on which they grow.             
                                       
 One or two houses have been bought up 
 by people outside the area and        
 considerably modernised, one with     
 thatch and double glazing. Others have
 been simply allowed to fall down and  
 are now in ruins.                     </content>
