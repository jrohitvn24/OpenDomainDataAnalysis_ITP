		<title>10CHICHESTER'S SLOE FAIR.</title>
		<content>  The earliest record of the holding of
 a fair in  Chichester is the grant by 
 Henry I, about 1107-8 ,to Ralph,Bishop
 of Chichester,of a fair to be held for
 eight  days, at a time to be fixed  by
 the  Bishop. The date selected was the
 feast  of  St.Faith the Virgin,  whose
 cult was strong in  the city. The name
{"Sloe Fair"}seems to have been derived
 from the sloe tree  which stood in the
 field near the  North Gate of the city
 where the fair was held.              
  Although  the form  of  the fair  has
 varied  with  time, the tradition of  
{Sloe Fair} continues  to  the  present
 day.On{October 20th}a large funfair is
 held in the Northgate car-park for one
 day and Cicestrians enjoy themselves ,
 as in the past. During  World War II a
 single  caravan was parked on the site
 so  that  the  right  to  hold {      
{Sloe Fair }would  not  lapse.         </content>
