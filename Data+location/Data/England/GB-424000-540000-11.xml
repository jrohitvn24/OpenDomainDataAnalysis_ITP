		<title>11HEAD VERGER,DURHAM CATHEDRAL</title>
		<content> This job is very rewarding,you must   
 love and care for the people and enjoy
 your work.Since Mr.Rees came ten years
 ago he has seen many changes to the   
 Cathedral.The Dean before{Dean Baelz} 
 opened up the Cathedral for tourists, 
 this increased the vergers job.Now the
 vergers keep a{diary.}As they plan six
 months ahead it would throw the       
 Cathedral into chaos if it was lost.  
  Mr.Rees worked at Ely for three years
 and Wells for six years but he says   
 that he enjoys his work best at       
 Durham.He lives in the College,the    
 close adjoining the Cathedral so that 
 he can be called day or night.        
  There are fifty extra services each  
 year.The unique one is{The Miners'    
{Gala}which has been held for{         
{eighty-three years.}Mr.Rees is always 
 deeply moved by this service.
