		<title>01Skirlaugh Village</title>
		<content> Skirlaugh is a dormitory village of   
 just over six hundred houses. It is   
 situated about eight miles from Hull, 
 nine miles from Beverley and eight    
 miles from Hornsea.                   
   Although the area around Skirlaugh  
 is intensively farmed few of the      
 residents work in the agricultural    
 industry, most travel to the nearby   
 towns for work.                       
   The majority of the houses in the   
 village have been built on an estate  
 development in the last twenty years  
 before which the settlement was       
 restricted mainly to the four arms of 
 the crossroads.                       
   Notable buildings include the Church
 of St. Augustine, thought to be one of
 the finest examples of the            
 perpendicular style in the county, and
 the former workhouse, now the local   
 council offices.                      </content>
