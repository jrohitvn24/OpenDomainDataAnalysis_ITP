 Leading  off from the top of the      
 Leicester Road there is an unindicated
 footpath beginning at an old wooden   
 gate.The footpath follows the course  
 of a stream westwards along the bottom
 of a small valley;and passes to the   
 north of Castle Hill,which is the old 
 site of a Motte and Bailey castle.    
 The footpath although unmarked as     
 such,passes through pasture           
 land,providing a pleasant scenic      
 route.Near the stream there are clumps
 of gorse,which is uncommon            
 locally.Further on down the path,it   
 has been blocked by a new conifer wood
 plantation surrounded by an electric  
 fence.This unsigned footpath and the  
 blockages are common problems in this 
 area.
