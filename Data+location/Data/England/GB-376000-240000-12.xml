		<content> In 1978 this college moved from       
 Cheltenham to the present{70 acre     
{site,}once home of the{Abbey Girls    
{School.}It has 94 students between 13 
 and 21 but will have 350 in 6 houses  
 during the{Summer School.}There are 10
 admin staff and 14 teachers who help  
 the Far East and African students     
 bridge the gap between their          
 background and the West. Problems of  
{language, culture}and even{diet}have  
 to be overcome before students can    
 compete for the decreasing number of  
 places offered to{overseas students}at
 UK universities. Thus the courses     
 emphasise{English Language for        
{foreigners.}Recruitment is helped by  
 the long tradition of education in the
 area and the spectacular views from   
 the terraced site of the Severn       
 Valley. It has a gym, outdoor heated  
 swimming pool and 28 tennis courts.   </content>
