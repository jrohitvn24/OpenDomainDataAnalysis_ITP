		<title>13ST MARGARET'S SCHOOL</title>
		<content> St Margaret's School opened in 1955 as
 a primary school.  Since then there   
 have been 2 headmasters, Mr Baker and 
 Mr Hofton.  Mr Baker was at the school
 when it first opened and also served a
 time at the old school which is now   
 the Angmering village library.        
 There are 8 classes _ 3 infants and 5 
 junior.  the school teaches all types 
 of subjects except practical science  
 experiements.  The school roll is     
 200_250.  The school's emblem is a    
 Phoenix because a new school was built
 out of the "ashes" of the old one.    
 The school's facilities include an    
 outdoor heated swimming pool. The     
 pupils have half an hour each day in  
 it during the summer. Mayday is a     
 tradition. The pupils dance in        
 fancy dress round a Maypole.The school
 elects a May Queen and an attendant.
