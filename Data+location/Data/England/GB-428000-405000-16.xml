 Our house is in Manor Park.It is a new
 red brick council house which has been
 built for about 6 months.As you go    
 through the front door you are in the 
 entrance hall.There are 3 doors       
 leading off and a flight of stairs.   
 Straight forward is the downstairs    
 toilet.The door on the left is the    
 lounge.Straight opposite is the dining
 room. Next is the kitchen where the   
 back door is and there is a pantry. Up
 the stairs are 3 bedrooms a bathroom  
 and a cupboard.On the left is the     
 bathroom and the second largest       
 bedroom occupied by my mum and dad.On 
 the right are two bedrooms mine and my
 sisters.
