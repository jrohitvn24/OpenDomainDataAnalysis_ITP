 farmland, woodland and residential    
 parts.The farms are in parishes of    
 Stourport-on-Severn,Rock,Ribbesford in
 Wyre Forest D.C.and Astley in Malvern 
 Hills D.C.Farming is mainly arable    
 with sheep and cattle.The woodland is 
 in two main sections,the larger being 
 part of Ribbesford Wood,controlled by 
 the Forestry Commission.The smaller is
 Areley Wood,part of a private estate. 
    The River Severn flows through the 
 area,much used for fishing and        
 pleasure boating. Caravan sites are   
 situated on the banks. Streams such as
 Gladderbrook and Dick Brook run into  
 the Severn through very attractive    
 country-side. Stagborough Hill and    
 Heightington are high points.
