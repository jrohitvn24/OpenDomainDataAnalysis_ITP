		<content>    In Accrington there are many       
different religions. Therefore there   
are a number of churches. Altogether in
block are about twelve churches. There 
are Christians,Moslems and Hindus.     
    Most churches are very old but some
quite new,such as the New Jerusalem    
churches.                              
    Some people in Accrington go to    
church every Sunday and enjoy going but
quite a few do not.A few people think  
very highly of religion,but quite a few
people  not believe in God at all.     
    A lot of people think that God can 
help them in times when they are       
feeling depressed and sad. Some people 
dnot have the time to go to church but 
still believe in God.
