 at St Marys Church, South Cowton.     
 During the same weekend, a brass band 
 played at the Sunday Gift Day Service.
 Both villages hold annual sports days 
 in the summer. There are races for the
 children, and a fancy dress parade for
 young and old. These days usually end 
 with a disco in the village hall.     
 A strawberry fayre was held in July   
 as a money raising effort for the     
 Methodist Chapel. The Nursery 'Fun    
 Run' is a 3 mile race around N Cowton 
 with competitors being sponsored and  
 proceeds going to the Nursery funds.  
 A 'Magical Evening' was held in North 
 Cowton, and another music night in    
 East Cowton village hall.             
 A recent famous visitor to East Cowton
 was the former Home Secretary, Leon
