		<title>10CLINT, BURNT YATES ROBBERY</title>
		<content> On Saturday, 8th June, 1985 around    
 tea-time, two boys aged about eight or
 nine broke into the school. They      
 entered by breaking a window, but took
 nothing of value or caused any damage 
 inside the school.                    
 The boys, who attended a special      
 school at Boston Spa, been on a day   
 trip to Brimham Rocks and had run     
 away. To get to Burnt Yates they stole
 two bicycles.                         
 They were caught by a man who thought 
 they were acting suspiciously. When he
 had caught them he locked them in his 
 shed. Then he telephoned the police.  
 The two boys both have long police    
 records. Every police station in      
 Harrogate knows them. They will appear
 in court and be prosecuted. Then they 
 will go back to Boston Spa.
