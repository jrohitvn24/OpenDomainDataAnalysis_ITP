		<content> Lord Armstrong  the great engineer and
 creator of the Cragside estate near   
 Rothbury once owned Netherton         
 Southside Netherton Burnfoot and      
 Netherton Mill farms.He developed     
 water energy units at thm similar to  
 those at Cragside(supposedly the first
 house in Britain to be lit by electric
 light).The water sources were         
 respctively  a pond formed behind the 
 farm, a dam built across the river and
 a water channel built from a spring on
 Elilaw farm.                          
   The power was generated by a turbine
 in the farm buildings.There is still  
 evidence of the water sources but not 
 of the turbines and machinery driven  
 by them.
