		<title>05Childrens clothes in Leiston</title>
		<content> Childrens clothes are mostly made of  
man made fibres.Some of these are,nylon
,acrilic,polyester and terylene.These  
are very convenient because they wash  
easily and you dont have to iron them, 
but some cotton and wool are still     
used.                                  
  Most boys and girls like to wear     
jeans or long trousers.Lots of children
and like to wear t-shirts.These        
t-shirts sometimes have pictures like a
 horses head and some have writing like
RELAX! while others have patterns on   
them.Track-suits were invented for     
sport.But they are so comfortable that 
children wear them all the time.The    
same thing happened with trainer shoes 
because they were comfortable and      
cheap.Children wear them all the time. 
  Outside if the weather is cold most  
children like to wear warm padded      
jackets with hoods.                    </content>
