		<title>03MAIDSTONE TRAFFIC CONGESTION</title>
		<content>   Maidstone's recent rapid residential
 growth has greatly increased pressure 
 on the town centre's road system and  
 only Medway crossing. Single incidents
 cause lengthy tailbacks, especially - 
{1.Where the A20 and A249 converge east
{of the town centre-i.e. top of Square 
{Hill and bottom of Sittingbourne Road.
{2.Along the 4-lane, single-carriageway
{Loose Road through squares 7653 and   
{7654 and its extension as a one-way   
{system north of 764548. At the morning
{peak a third of this traffic is making
{for west of the bridge and a third for
{destinations north of Maidstone.      
  Traffic along the southern artery has
 also been increased by private haulage
 depots in the nearby countryside and  
 by Park Wood Industrial Estate in sq. 
 7852. Heavy lorries soon overload road
 surfaces and the necessary roadworks  
 cause further delays.                 </content>
