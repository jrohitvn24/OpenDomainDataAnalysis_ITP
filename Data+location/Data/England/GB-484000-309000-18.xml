    The land in our sector is half     
 pasture and half arable. Oil seed     
 rape, wheat and barley are at present 
 all being grown. Most of the pasture  
 land is on the hillsides, this is     
 because the land is much poorer and   
 more difficult to cultivate here.     
                                       
    The pastue land is used by the     
 farmers for grazing their cattle and  
 sheep. Most of the farms are about    
 forty acres in size. Some of the grass
 will be used for silage and making    
 hay.                                  
                                       
    Even today on the pasture land it i
 till possible to be able to see the   
 old three_feild system. However many  
 of the hedges that were built around  
 the enclosed land are now in the      
 process of being pulled down.         </content>
