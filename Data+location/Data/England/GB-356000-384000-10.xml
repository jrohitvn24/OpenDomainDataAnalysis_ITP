 a boy of 11.                          
 On Tuesday I got up at six o'clock and
 got ready for my paper round.At 7.30  
 I went to the paper shop by motor car.
 When I had delivered all of my papers 
 I went home and watched breakfast time
 television.At 8.45am I went to school.
 First lesson was mathematics and we   
 used our Alpha Beta books.At 10.30am  
 it was playtime.Damian,Steven,Mark,   
 and I played soccer.At the end of     
 playtime it was English Comprehension.
 For dinner we had chips,beans and     
 sausage and Angel Delight for afters. 
 Our lessons continued until 3.45pm and
 then we went home.I watched television
 all evening.
