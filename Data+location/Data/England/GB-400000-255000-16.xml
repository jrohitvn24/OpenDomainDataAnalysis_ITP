 is up by 6.30.Soon afterwards everyone
 is busy preparing to leave the house  
 by 8 o'clock.                         
 First to leave is father,who commutes 
 20 miles to the edge of Birmingham.He 
 is not seen again until early evening 
 at the earliest.The eldest child      
 travels by coach to a middle school in
 Redditch,and returns by 3.30.The      
 youngest child spends her day with a  
 childminder while the middle child    
 attends Inkberrow First School,where  
 her mother works.The family meet again
 for an evening meal.The two elder     
 children then go out to cricket and   
 gymnastic classes.As they return home 
 they read or do homework before going 
 to bed.Jobs are done and everything is
 made ready for the next day.All is    
 quiet by 11 o'clock.
