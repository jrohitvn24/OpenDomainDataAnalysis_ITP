		<title>14Flinton Hill Farm</title>
		<content>   My dad works on this farm. His day  
 starts at 8am and he works till       
 4.30pm. He has half an hour dinner    
 break. During the{harvest} he         
 sometimes works for 21 hours a day. I 
 don't see him very much at this time  
 of the year but he gets better wages. 
 Most of the land is used for{crops.}  
 This year wheat, barley and rape seed 
 have been grown.                      
   Other fields have been used for 24  
 cows. These will later be sold for    
 beef. The vet comes to check the cows 
 for diseases. I help him put them in  
 the trap while he takes blood samples.
   There are five barns in the farmyard
 some are used for storing corn, straw 
 and hay. Others are used for garaging 
 tractors, diggers, cultivators and    
 fork lift trucks. Sometimes I enjoy   
 playing on the broken down tractor,but
 most of the time it's a lonely life.  </content>
