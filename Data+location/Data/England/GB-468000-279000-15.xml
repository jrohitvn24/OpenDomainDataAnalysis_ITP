  I have to do one of three shifts a   
day on a rota system, 6am to 2pm, 2pm  
to 10pm or 10pm to 6am. I have been a  
 policeman for 22 years. We are led by 
 our Chief Constable.                  
  My equipment consists of a truncheon,
a C.B. set and a pair of handcuffs. I  
also carry a whistle. I have the Police
Station in Clipston to live and work in
have a Panda Car to visit the other    
villages that I am responsible for.  In
the boot of my car I keep all the radio
equipment as well as a breathaliser    
kit. Normally I work just in the       
villages in my care unless there is an 
emergency elsewhere.                   
  We have recently had a new style of  
uniform, which I do not like.  It does 
not have sensible pockets, and the peak
cap gives me no protection at all.
