 the people of Barnt Green, Cofton     
 Hackett and Hopwood we found out lots 
 of interesting things.                
 The shops, offices and services in    
 Barnt Green employed a lot of people  
 but only a small proportion lived in  
 the village.                          
 Most of the working population travel 
 by car towards the connurbation of    
 Birmingham. some use the train for    
 their transport.                      
 Nearby towns such as Redditch and     
 Bromsgrove provide{employment}for the
