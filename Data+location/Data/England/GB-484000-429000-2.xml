		<content>  I live in a house that was built over
 a hundred years ago.It was built for  
 the manager of the brickworks.It      
 stands at the side of the canal.The   
 brickworks used to be next door to my 
 house.The bricks that my house is     
 built from,are a light greyish        
 colour.Some of the outside pieces of  
 the bricks are cracked.The bricks are 
 a bit irregular they are not as neat  
 as new bricks.                        
  The house has a big chimney stack.It 
 has four fireplaces.There is one in   
 each bedroom upstairs and there is one
 in the two rooms downstairs.Last year 
 we had to have some new floors put in 
 the bedrooms upstairs as the wooden   
 beams had become unsafe.My dad has    
 built my sister and I a playroom in a 
 shed behind the house.
