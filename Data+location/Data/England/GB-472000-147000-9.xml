		<content> AS THERE US VERY LITTLE IN THE WAY OF 
 WORK IN OUR ACTUAL AREA, WE TOOK A    
 SURVEY OF THE JOBS DONE BY PARENTS WHO
 DID NOT WORK OUT OF THE AREA. IN      
 FACT,OVER 77% OF FATHERS DID WORK OUT 
 OF THE AREA, THOSE EMPLOYED IN OUR    
 BLOCK WERE ALL INVOLVED WITH FARMING  
 SOME OWN THEIR OWN FARMS AND OTHERS   
 WERE FARM WORKERS.  VERY FEW OF OUR   
 MOTHERS HAD PAID EMPLOYMENT,ALTHOUGH A
 FEW WORKED OUT OF THE AREA.  THOSE SIX
 WHO HAD EMPLOYMENT IN THE AREA WORKED 
 EITHER AS DOMESTIC HELPS IN LARGE     
 HOUSES OR AS CLERICAL ASSISTANTS ON   
 FARMS.  THE ONLY OTHER WORK WE COULD  
 FIND IN OUR AREA WERE A FEW SHOP      
 ASSISTANTS AND PETROL PUMP ATTENDANTS.
 THIS REFLECTS THE LACK OF FACTORIES   
 AND BUSINESSES IN OUR AREA WHICH IS   
 ALMOST ALL FARMING.                   
                                       
                                       </content>
