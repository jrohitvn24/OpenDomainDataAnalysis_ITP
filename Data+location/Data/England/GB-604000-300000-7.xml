		<content> The square tower of the church is on  
 the south side, with a sundial over   
 the top of the massive archway. The   
 base of the tower forms the porch. A  
 winding stairs lead to two rooms ,one 
 with an oven . This may have been     
 used to make Communion wafers. The    
 roomsmay have provided accomodation   
 for the Benedictine monks             
 of Wymondham Abbey. There is one      
 Decorated window in the chancel , the 
 remainder Perpendicular. There are    
 some fragments of very old stained    
 glass with a picture of a saint, and  
 Christ holding a sphere. There is a   
 piscina in both the nave and the      
 chancel, the former being part of a   
 lady chapel.                          
 The fifteenth century font has blank  
 shields on it. Some of the pews have  
 poppy head carvings with pricket      
 holes.                                </content>
