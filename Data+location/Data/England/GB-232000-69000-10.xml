		<content>    The things about{Callington}we     
 think we need, don't need, like and   
 don't like.                           
    The{shopping area}is not very good,
 it is dear. At{Saltash and Plymouth   
 it is cheaper because they are bigger 
 places, and more popular. Three sweet 
 shops in Callington are too many,     
 two is ample.                         
    A{record and a computer shop}would 
 be very popular. An{indoor swimming   
{pool}would be ideal for the holidays  
 and also a roller skate rink, but I   
 don't think there will be one.        
    Summer sports is a event that takes
 place at the comprehensive in the     
 summer holidays. It is good for there 
 are many different sports.            
    It would be nice to have a{clothes 
{shop}which sold all the fashions.     
                                       
                                       </content>
