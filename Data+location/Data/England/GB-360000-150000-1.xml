		<title>01Emborough Parish &amp; District</title>
		<content> The small village of Emborough lies on
 the northern edge of the mendip Hills 
 on a limestone plateau, some 700 feet 
 above sea level.  The soil supports   
 mainly grass crops and grazing for    
 cattle.  As well as the parish of     
 Emborough, our area also includes     
 parts of the parishes of Binegar,     
 Cheton Mendip, Chilcompton and Ston   
 Easton.  It is dissected by two main  
 roads, the A37 and the B3139 which    
 cross at Old down. There has been some
 stone quarrying in the area in the    
 past although this is now abandoned.  
 The course of the Old Somerset &amp;      
 Dorset railway can still be traced in 
 places.  This mainly agricultural area
 is drained by several small streams   
 which feed the rivers Somer and Frome.
 There is one fair-sized lake,         
 Emborough pond, which provides local  
 fishing.                              </content>
