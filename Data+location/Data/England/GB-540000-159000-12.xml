       Cudham Church of England Primary
 School on Jail Lane is responsible for
 the education of 106 pupils and was   
 built in 1856.  There are 5 teachers, 
 2 cleaners, 1 cook and 3 dinner       
 ladies.  There is a small playground  
 made of Tarmac, with a netball pitch  
 and it is our winter playground.      
 There is a field with two football    
 pitches, 3 mounds, a sandpit, a tunnel
 mound, a concrete tunnel and a        
 climbing frame.  We play of the field 
 in summer.  there is an outdoor       
 swimming pool and two changing rooms. 
 The swimming pool is 1 metre deep, 19 
 metres long and 4 metres wide.  Round 
 the field are hedgerows which have    
 lots of small animals in them.  There 
 is also a wood at the bottom of the   
 field.                                </content>
