		<title>12P.T.A. at the School</title>
		<content> This school has a very active         
 Parent-Teacher Association which holds
 approximately 2 events per term. These
 events have included a Summer Fair,   
 Punch and Judy Show, Halloween Night  
 with apple bobbing, Beetle            
 Drives, Christmas Concert in the      
 Church Hall and a sponsored walk which
 raised Â£200. Under the D.E.S. Scheme  
 the parents bought the school a       
 computer. One major project, in the   
 past year has been the clearance and  
 redecoration of the empty school house
 attached to the main building. The    
 acquisition of this house has improved
 organisation in school by providing   
 administrative accommodation thereby  
 releasing the previous "all-purpose"  
 room in the main building for group   
 work, television, cooking, medicals   
 etc. Parental help is encouraged and  
 is freely and generously given.       </content>
