There are about 550 people living in   
Otley.There are about 200 houses of    
which about 40-45 are council houses.  
Although this is an agricultural area  
the number of people actually working  
on the land is fairly small.Most local 
people find employment either in       
Ipswich or in Woodbridge or in         
Felixstow.This means that transport is 
especially important.Rural bus services
tend to be rather limited.             
In the course of this survey I have    
received help from the children in the 
school who have investigated the       
farming.In addition Mr Mosesson at     
Otley Hall has supplied information.   
Finally I would like to record my      
thanks to all of the local people for  
their comments.  Mr.Peter Coleby(Otley 
Primary School)
