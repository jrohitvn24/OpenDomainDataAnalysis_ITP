		<content> An interesting aspect of local history
 is The Robin Hood Theatre.It was      
 founded by the Reverand Walker.It     
 forms a part of the cultural develop- 
 ment of the village and has a mixture 
 of amateur and professional produc-   
 tions.Sir D.Wolfitt began his acting  
 career at this theatre.Many famous    
 people have entertained here.An Amat- 
 eur Company produces regular plays.   
 Professional companies of actors,pupp-
 eteers and mime artists make regular  
 appearances.The theatre is fairly     
 well patronised and has suffered from 
 the economic cutbacks of the eighties.
 Another building of local,historical  
 interest is St.Michaels and All Angles
 Church.It is the religious centre for 
 the community.The herringbone         
 brickwork is very old.Ex-ray          
 photography recently recorded hidden  
 wall paintings.                       </content>
