		<title>17EMPLOYMENT IN RADSTOCK</title>
		<content> Many people in Radstock work in shops 
 or factories.They produce industrial  
 bags and shoes.There are also a number
 of small industries in the area.Many  
 people who are unemployed are         
 teenagers who have just left school.  
 They go for training to see how well  
 suited they are at different jobs.Many
 people commute to their place of work 
 in Bath or Bristol.                   
   Some jobs are taken up with farming 
 though there are not so many farms    
 around the Radstock area.People can   
 get part-time jobs from farmers       
 because sometimes the farmers need    
 people to help them at certain times  
 in the year.
