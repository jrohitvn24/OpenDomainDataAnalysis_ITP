		<title>13HIGH ERCALL HALL HIGH ERCALL</title>
		<content> Hamo Peveril bought High Ercall in    
 1098 and it remained in his family    
 until 1271. It was then given to the  
 De Ercalls. It then stayed with the De
 Ercalls until 1391. Then a cousin of  
 William De Ercall gave High Ercall to 
 Thomas Newport-a parson. Thomas       
 Newport became Lord of the Manor and  
 in 1608 Francis Newport started to    
 build High Ercall Hall. Francis       
 Newport built a strong wall round the 
 Hall and a moat, then later on he     
 built a draw bridge over the moat. The
 Hall is three storeys high, the lower 
 part is built up of sand stone blocks 
 with the upper part built of brick.   
 The sand stone blocks have come from  
 Viriconium the Roman village on horse 
 and cart. Some of them also could have
 come from Haughmond Abbey.
