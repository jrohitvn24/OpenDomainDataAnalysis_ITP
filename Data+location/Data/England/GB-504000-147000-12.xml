		<title>12SHERE SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   In those days there were 130        
 children in the school aged from 5 to 
 14 years. These children all walked to
 school,and walked home to have their  
 mid day meal. Today all the children  
 stay at school for their midday meal  
 which is brought by van from a local  
 kitchen.                              
   The children all play together in   
 the playground in 1985,in 1927 the    
 playground was separated for boys and 
 girls. We discovered that we still    
 play games in the playground like Mr. 
 &amp; Mrs.Woods did when they were here,  
 such as football,hopscotch and "The   
 Big Ship Sails".                      
   In 1985 we have a climbing frame in 
 the playground which is fairly recent 
 but the large oak tree is still in the
 same place.                           
   Today the toilets are all indoors   
 and the outside ones are demolished.  </content>
