		<title>15Local History in Lezant</title>
		<content> There are two ancient chapels attached
 to houses in our survey area and      
 another just outside.At{Landue House} 
 there is an oratory chapel dedicated  
 to{St.Bridget}while in{Lezant}there   
 is{St.Lawrence Chapel}which is part of
 a house and is at least 500 years old.
 It may have belonged to{Trewarlett    
{Manor}which declined in the 16th      
 Century.If the chapel had not already 
 fallen into disuse,it would have been 
 suppressed by the Reformation.It was  
 converted into a cottage and then in  
 the 17th Century the front portion of 
 what is now {St.Lawrence House}was    
 added.The water,which is pure,  comes 
 from a "Holy Well" in the orchard.Just
 outside the survey area is{St.Mary    
{Magdalene's Chapel}at{Trecarrell Manor
 perhaps the  best preserved example in
 the country.
