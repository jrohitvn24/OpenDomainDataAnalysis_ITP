		<title>10CRUDWELL VILLAGE BLACKSMITH</title>
		<content>{The old smithy}has been in the same   
 family for four hundred years.It is   
 now run by{Mr Bert Tidmarsh and his   
{son.}The four workers start work at   
 7.30am.They don't shoe many horses in 
 the smithy because of the noisy       
 traffic outside.Instead{they travel   
{round to farms and stables.}They take 
 a{portable forge}with them so that    
 they can make the shoes fit properly. 
 There are lots of tools in the smithy 
 that the men make for themselves.The  
 men make the horseshoes from{strips of
{metal}that they heat in the furnace.  
 They use{an electric fan now}to get   
 the fire going{but still have some    
{large bellows in working order.       
 Everywhere you look you can see       
 horseshoes in many different sizes and
 weights.
