		<content> The bus service through Belmont       
 Village is part of the Greater        
 Manchester{Transport}system and       
 runs between the Sailing  Club        
 at the far end of the Village and     
 Bolton{Bus Station,}along the         
 A675.There are about ten buses a day, 
 the first leaving the Village at 6.50 
 and the last at 23.15.The buses are   
 usually{single decker,}manned by one  
 conductor/ driver.                    
 There is one bus a week to Blackburn  
 despite the fact that Belmont is part 
 of the Borough of Blackburn.          
 Most people who live in the survey    
 area find it necessary to have their  
 own{cars}owing to the infrequency of  
 buses and the isolated situation of   
 the community.
