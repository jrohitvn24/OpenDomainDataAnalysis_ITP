		<content> Whilst this area does not contain any 
 stately homes,its development can be  
 traced back through the centuries by  
 the many old buildings to be found in 
 it. The oldest is{Springfield Grange  
 once known as{Monks Grange.}It was a  
 Benedictine outpost and dates from the
 13th. century.                        
    Most of the very old buildings are 
 farms as is to be expected of a rural 
 area, and those still inhabited today 
 include Babylon Farm from the 15th    
 century, Coldwell Cottage-now known as
 The Moat-which is 16th. century.Hay   
 Farm, Cugley and The Oaks are all 17th
 century. Green's Farm and Queen Anne  
 Cottage, one of the few thatched      
 cottages in the block, are 18th       
 century. Many of the now modernised   
 cottages also date from earlier       
 centuries and many still retain old   
 features.                             </content>
