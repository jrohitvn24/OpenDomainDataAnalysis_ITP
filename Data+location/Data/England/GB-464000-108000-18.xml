		<content> A survey was held in which 60 children
 interviewed their parents on what they
 did for a living. The results were as 
 follows:-                             
{ARMED FORCES - 9  OFFICE PERSONNEL - 4

{  HOUSEWIVES-25                       
 This list does not include those      
 people who did not conveniently fit   
 into any of the categories.  Those not
 mentioned include an artist, a        
 draughtsman, a diver, a lorry loader,a
 community worker, a metal supplier and
 a scientist.                          
 As there were no fathers or mothers   
 put down as unemployed this survey    
 cannot be considered as typical of    
 most other areas.
