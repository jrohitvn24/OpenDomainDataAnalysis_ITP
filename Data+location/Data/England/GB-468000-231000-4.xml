		<content> The{Manor}of the{Prebend End}of       
 Buckingham cum Gawcott.               
                        This  Manor was
 the{Church's}until the reformation. At
 the time of  the {Doomsday Survey}this
 Manor consisted of land enough fo four
 ploughs;  a{mill }valued at  10, with
 meadow and  wood for  fences worth  in
 all 6 in  Buckingham and {one hide}in
 Gawcott.                              
   In October 1764 a lot of people went
 to  court to see which  seeds could be
 sown and what animals could  be  kept.
 Later,all the manor fields were{cut up
{into furlongs}and  given a name. Their
 names have been used for roads in some
 of the new estates. eg{Bushey Close   
{and Hare Close.                       
   The  open  fields  were called Great
 Portfield,  Little  Portfield.   Lower
 Portfield Way and Portfield Close have
 been named after them.                </content>
