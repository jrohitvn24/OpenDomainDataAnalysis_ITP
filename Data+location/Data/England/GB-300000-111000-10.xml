		<title>10GRAND WESTERN CANAL</title>
		<content> In{1796}an Act was obtained for the   
 construction of the{Grand Western     
{Canal.}The intention was that the     
 canal should run from Taunton to      
 Topsham with three branches going off 
 to Tiverton,Cullompton and Wellington.
{The Grand Western Canal}runs from     
 Tiverton to Lowdwells, but the last   
 half between Great Fossend and        
 Lowdwells is dried up.Between         
 Halberton and Sampford Peverell there 
 are four bridges-Greenway,Swingbridge,
 Rock and Battens.                     
 It is very calm by the canal nowadays 
 and there are barges which you can    
 ride up and down the canal. The barges
 are pulled up and down the canal by   
 shire horses walking along a          
 pathway.The canal is also used for    
 fishing and water festivals to amuse  
 people.                               
                                       </content>
