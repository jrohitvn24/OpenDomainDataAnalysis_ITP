		<title>15Industry at Kemsley</title>
		<content> Kemsley Paper Mill, owned by Bowaters,
 is the only major industrial          
 development in the area and the       
 building dominates the landscape and  
 is the major employer. The Mill has   
 four paper making machines and these  
 are in constant production, 24 hours a
 day, with the exception of maintenance
 The Mill has its own power house and  
 provides power for another Mill in    
 Sittingbourne, it also provides the   
 National Grid with electricity.       
 Bowaters look after their employees   
 and help with social and recreational 
 facilities.However, the Mill has an   
 affect on the people living nearby as 
 day and night lorries thunder through 
 the village to get to the Mill. There 
 is always the smell associated with   
 paper making which hangs over the     
 village and sometimes spreads beyond  
 into Iwade and as far as Sittingbourne</content>
