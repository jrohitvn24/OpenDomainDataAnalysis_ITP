		<content>   Stevenage lies on chalk in a valley 
between the Chilterns and the East     
Anglian Heights. The Saxons settled in 
the area and have given names which can
still be recognised today. The original
name was Stigenace (meaning strong oak)
from which it has changed to Stevenage.
   The village grew into a local market
and by 1448 Henry VI confirmed the     
market charter. Expansion continued as 
a result of the improvements to the    
main road (The Great North Road)       
connecting London to the North. From   
the Eighteenth Century onwards the     
settlement became an important coaching
centre. By the end of the Second World 
War the population reached almost 7000.
   In 1946 the Government passed the   
New Towns Act to relieve pressure from 
London and to provide people with a    
more attractive environment in which   
to live. The population is now 74000   </content>
