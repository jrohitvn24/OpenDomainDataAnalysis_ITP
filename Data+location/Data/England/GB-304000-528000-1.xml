		<content> This area contains four villages;     
{Great Clifton,Bridgefoot, Little      
{Clifton and Greysouthen.}The          
 area is mainly used for dairy farming.
 Most people travel to the local towns 
 to work. These are Workington,        
 Cockermouth, Whitehaven and Maryport. 
 We border the Northwestern edge of the
{Lake District National park}and are   
 near Ennerdale and Buttermere. We have
 extensive views across the mountains. 
 The river{Derwent}flows               
 through the middle of the area        
 and is very popular for salmon and sea
 trout fishing. The river empties into 
 the sea at Workington.

 road connecting West Cumbria with the 
 M6, bisects the area.The intersection 
 of the A66 and the A595, the road to  
 Whitehaven and Egremont is in the     
 centre of the area.                   </content>
