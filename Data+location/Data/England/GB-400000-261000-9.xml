		<title>09FECKENHAM HORSE SHOW</title>
		<content>                                       
  Feckenham holds a Horse show every   
 year, usually on the same day as the  
 Wake.(See previous page).             
                                       
  The show is held on a nearby farm and
 people come from miles around. It     
 takes a whole year to organise the    
 event as it is so huge. Many local    
 groups(including the First School)    
 receive a donation from the profits.  
                                       
  This year there was a demonstation by
 the local Hunt. There are events for  
 showjumping and gymkhana, as well as  
 Fancy dress and carting.              
                                       
  Many of the local children have their
 own ponies, and entered the           
 Gymkhana.There were beer and          
 refreshment tents for tired adults.
