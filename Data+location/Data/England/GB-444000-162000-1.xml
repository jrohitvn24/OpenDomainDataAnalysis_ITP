		<content>{This attractive area}lies South of    
 Newbury forming part of the{River     
{Enborne's}valley.Woods, fields and    
 streams intermingle with spacious     
 houses throughout much of the area,   
 although on section is almost         
 completely built up.This is{Wash      
{Common,}at the south western extremity
 of Newbury,where older street names   
 such as{Battery End}commemorate the   
 Civil War battle fought there.Two main
 roads pass though the area,busy with  
 traffic,especially at holiday times.  
 The numerous lorries emphasise        
 Newbury's position on the route from  
 the{Midlands to the Channel ports.}A  
 former railway line is the proposed   
 route for a necessary by-pass.        
 Amenities include several types of    
 schools,elegant Sandleford Priory     
 among them,churches,garages,and a     
 small sewage works.                   </content>
