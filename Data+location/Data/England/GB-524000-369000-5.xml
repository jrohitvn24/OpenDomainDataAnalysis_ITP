		<content> SPRING is  walking down country lanes,
 Where the quiet river flows.          
 SUMMER is walking near the hedgerows, 
 Full of colourful bloom.              
 AUTUMN is walking in the forest       
 On brown, dead leaves.                
 WINTER is walking on icy ground,      
 Frozen cold and hard.                 
              FOUR SEASONS by D. Neave 
                                       
 Peace, quiet _  perfect  for rest,    
 But is anything ever what it seems?   
 There is always work to be done:      
 Harvest mice reap the manmade harvest_
 The combine will never eat this;      
 Bees fill their sacks with nectar,    
 A drink of the gods;                  
 Squirrels fill their winter larders;  
 The achitects of the trees, the birds,
 Gather in masses in trees and in air, 
 Soon to fill the sky.                 
                 SURVIVAL by D.M. Burr </content>
