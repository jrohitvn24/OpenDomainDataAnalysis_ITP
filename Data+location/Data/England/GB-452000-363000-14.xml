		<content>{SQUARE}You play the game Square by    
 making a square with jumpers.Be sure  
 you have a football and as many people
 as you like can play.Pick two people  
 to be on and the rest go in the square
 to sit.The two who are on have to kick
 the ball at those in the square,who   
 try to defend themselves with feet or 
 head.If the ball hits someone,the rest
 must throw him out of the square,and  
 he is on.The last person left is the  
 winner and picks two for the next go. 
{BUDGE}You need several people and some
 trees or posts.One person is{on}while 
 the rest go to trees and are safe.    
 If someone runs to your tree and yells
 BUDGE you have to run to another tree.
 The person who is on tries to catch a 
 person who is running,if they do then 
 that person is on.It is better if you 
 have more people than trees,so people 
 have to keep moving.                  </content>
