		<title>04THE COMMON,BADDESLEY ENSOR</title>
		<content> Baddesley Common covers about 75      
 acres.It stretches from North to South
 along the Eastern boundary of the     
 village.Many paths lead across the    
 common to various places in the       
 village.The vegetation is mostly rough
 grassland and heather with Birch,Oak  
 and Hawthorn trees.The common has been
 there for as long as anyone can       
 remember.Some people use the common to
 graze horses and goats.Children play  
 on the open spaces and some people    
 ride motor bikes over it.The common is
 owned by the "Lords of the Manor" but 
 the Parish Council are hoping that the
 Warwickshire Nature Conservation Trust
 will take over the management of the  
 land in order to protect the          
 interesting wild life that is to be   
 found there.Baddesley folk are very   
 proud of their common and are         
 determined to keep it for the future. </content>
