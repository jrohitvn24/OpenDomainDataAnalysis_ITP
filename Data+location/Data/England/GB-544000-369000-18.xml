		<content>  There is a primary school in         
 Willoughby to which go 68 pupils from 
 the surrounding area.There are three  
 classes one of which is a wooden      
 structure that holds the youngest     
 children taught by Mrs.Ward.The others
 are in two rooms of the main building 
 which is mainly of brick;but attached 
 to it is the hall which is made of    
 wood.Mr.B.Dawson teaches the middle   
 class and also music.The Headmaster is
 Mr.R.S.J.Saunders who has Class 3.    
  Every day we have maths and English  
 lessons in the morning.In the after-  
 noon we may do R.E.,history,geography,
 science,art,woodwork or needlework,   
 P.E.and games.Stories are read,too.   
  We play football,netball,cricket,    
 rounders,athletics and gymnastics.We  
 only have a small playground so some  
 of these activities are played on the 
 village playing field.                </content>
