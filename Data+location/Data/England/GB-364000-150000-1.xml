 Chilcompton and Stratton-on-the       
 -Fosse, are mainly rural areas. The   
 villages are situated about 12 miles  
 from Bath and 2 miles from Midsomer   
 Norton. The population of each village
 is around 1,600. There are a number of
 farms, mostly dairy, and a little     
 light industry. Downside Abbey and    
 School dominate the area with many of 
 the staff who work there, living in   
 the villages. Much of the land is     
 owned by either the Abbey or the Duchy
 of Cornwall. Because of this there is 
 no major development. Prince          
 Charles, the Prince of Wales,         
 occasionally visits the villages to   
 meet people who work on his farms.
