 The most famous family in Langar were 
 the{Howes}who lived at the Hall.      
{Richard}was the hero of the family.   
    Born in 1725 he went on a round the
 world voyage at aged 15 as commander  
 of the English fleet.At aged 69 he won
 the first naval battle of the         
 Napoleonic Wars in 1794.It was known  
 as{"The Glorious 1st of June".        
  The main idea was to intercept the   
 grain ships going to{France from      
{America}to prevent famine.            
 Earl Howe's fleet captured many French
 ships but the grain ships escaped.    
 For his victory he became a hero and  
{King George 3rd }presented him with a 
 diamond studded sword.Also in Langar  
 Church,where he is buried hangs the   
 tapestry taken from a Spanish ship by 
 Admiral Howe.                         </content>
