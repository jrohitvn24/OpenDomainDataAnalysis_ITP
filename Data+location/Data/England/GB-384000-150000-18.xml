  This company makes concrete blocks   
 from gravel, sand and dust.  The sand 
 comes from Dorset, the stone from the 
 Mendips.  A machine called a shovel   
 puts the things on a long conveyor    
 belt. They are dropped down onto      
 another long belt which takes them up 
 to the mixing machine.  This looks    
 like a gigantic food mixer.  When it  
 is mixed it drops down into a huge    
 bucket and is then transferred to the 
 moulds. This was almost all auto-     
 matically controlled.  They are left  
 to dry for about three days.  They are
 turned over by a special machine. It  
 can turn thirty-six blocks at once.   
 They make 20,000 blocks every day. The
 men work fast because they get paid   
 for how many blocks they make.
