		<title>11BEVERTON FARM</title>
		<content> The farm has no modern services, no   
 gas, no mains drainage, no telephone, 
 no electricity and no mains water. He 
 gets all his water from a spring down 
 the bottom of the garden near to the  
 river Tone which runs along the edge  
 of his land. He does own a car however
 which he uses to go shopping in       
 Wiveliscombe. He has no television of 
 course but does use a small battery   
 powered radio and borrows large       
 print books from the library.         
 He does his cooking on an Rayburn     
 stove which also heats the house. He  
 uses mainly wood on this but also a   
 little coal. He also has a gas ring   
 run from bottled gas for some cooking 
 when the Rayburn is out.              
 He lights the house with an oil lamp.
