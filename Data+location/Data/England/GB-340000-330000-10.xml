		<content>  Most residents have come to this area
 in the last 20 years. All homes are   
 supplied with electricity and main    
 water and are heated with oil or solid
 fluel. All have septic tanks for      
 sanitation. Families generally enjoy a
 comfortable, traditional family life. 
 They have a telephone, washing        
 machine, refrigerator etc. Most have a
 freezer and a car, which is necessary 
 as the bus service is limited to twice
 a week and no shops exist in the area.
 There is a hospital car service run by
 local voluntary helpers. Most women   
 like to sew or knit and some belong to
 the Womens Institute, while wine and  
 beer making and gardening are popular 
 sparetime activities. Everyone has a  
 television which is the most favoured 
 entertainment.
