 Tow Law{is a former pit village with  
{roughly 2,220 people living here at   
{the moment.It was built 1,000ft above 
{sea level overlooking the valley of   
{the River Wear. The fortnightly cattle
{mart attracts farmers from many miles 
{around, especially in Spring and      
{Autumn.                               
{                                      
{Sunniside,}a mile to the east, also   
 owes it's existence to coal. Just off 
 the main road a{miner's handball court
 still stands as evidence of the past. 
                                       
 After the collieries disappeared much 
 of the surrounding land was open-cast 
 and then returned to grazing land.    
 Farmers now keep many cows and sheep  
 on land which was once crossed by some
 of the earliest railways in the world.
