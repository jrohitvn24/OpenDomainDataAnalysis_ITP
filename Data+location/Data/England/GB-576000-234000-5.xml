		<content>   The only Police Station in the area 
 is in Castle Hedingham and is dated   
 1914. It is manned by a sergeant and 3
 other policemen. No women P.C.'s are  
 present. There is one vehicle, a      
 Vauxhall Chevette. There is one cell  
 but this is used for storage only. A  
 courtroom is attached and is used     
 regularly. There are three shifts to  
 cover the 24hr. day The opening hours 
 are 9-10am and 6-7pm. The blue light  
 on the police van is the first target 
 for vandals. A considerable amount of 
 lost property is handed in. 40% of    
 this is not claimed. Contact between  
 police and children is encouraged by  
 the existence of a Liaison Officer. He
 visits the school regularly to talk to
 the children about road safety and the
 dangers of speaking to strangers.
