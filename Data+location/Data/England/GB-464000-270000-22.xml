<title>22Coton Village</title>
<content>

Coton is a very small village, known as a hamlet of about 70 people. It lies in a sheltered Northamptonshire valley. The most imposing house is Coton Manor, surrounded by beautiful gardens. A few cottages are made of mud and thatched but the rest are under 100 years old. There is no shop or public house although there is still a phone box and post box. &lt;br />&lt;br />The residents vary greatly and include a retired banker, former solicitor and the managing director of a Northampton shoe manufacturer. The locals are friendly and helpful to each other but don't like any sort of change. They are wary of new families who move into the village until they get to know them. It is bleak in winter but beautiful in spring with many birds and wild flowers. &lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
