		<title>02THE RESERVOIR "The ressie"</title>
		<content> The reservoir is a place where you can
 play.We get sticks and some string and
 go fishing.Sometimes we go and climb  
 through a pipe underneath the ground. 
 We climb up trees and jump down on    
 each other.The pipe leads to a        
 waterfall.We went to{County Hall}it's 
 beside the "ressie."We make jumps for 
 our bikes.One day we went in to have a
 swim.The water was very cold but it   
 was avery hot day.Once we went fishing
 and caught some sticklebacks,water    
 snails,leeches and newts.When we came 
 out of the water sticking to us were  
 little red and black things.From      
 the"ressie" runs a burn this is as far
 as we have gone. We think it about 8  
 miles long.There is an old shed or hut
 about 2 miles on.We played there once 
 but must admit it is very dangerous.It
 is spooky.
