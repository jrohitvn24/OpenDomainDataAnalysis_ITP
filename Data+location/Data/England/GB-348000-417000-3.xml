		<title>03OCCUPATIONS IN CROSTON</title>
		<content> The table of house types in Croston   
 shows that since 1972 there has been a
 much bigger demand for detatched      
 rather than semi-detatched housing.   
 This fact suggests that Croston is    
 being used as a{dormitory settlement. 
 One of the reasons for the daily      
 exodus is the{limited work}in the     
 village itself.There are{four small   
{firms}concerned with timber or joinery
 and their total workforce is about    
 sixty, whilst the largest single firm 
 is a{small textile mill}with about    
 seventy employees.                    
 Apart from these industries, the main 
 sources of employment in the village  
 are the{shops and offices.}They       
 consist of the following:             
 11 Food shops,1 Post Office,1 Chemist 
 1 Clothes shop,2 Hairdressers,3 Banks 
 1 Newsagents,1 Building Society,      
 2 garages and 3 Builders Yards.       </content>
