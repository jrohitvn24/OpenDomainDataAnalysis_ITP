   Years ago,before maps and books were
easily available,it was the custom once
a year to {Beat the Bounds} of the     
parish. It was the best way of drumming
into people's minds just where the     
boundaries of the parish lay. It was of
important to know because it used to be
the parish that helped you out in time 
of need.Some say that the choir boys   
were beaten to make quite sure they    
remembered.                            
   Nowdays in sprawling suburbia it is 
just as important to feel that we      
belong somewhere. Parts of Mottingham  
are in the borough of Greenwich,Bromley
and Lewisham.The only boundery that    
really makes sense is the old parish   
boundary of St.Andrew so the choir and 
parishioners countinue the custom.
