		<title>17MARWOOD N. SCHOOL OUTINGS.</title>
		<content>    We are very lucky at our school    
 because we go out on lots of trips and
 outings.                              
    This term we have had three trips  
 out in connection with the Domesday   
 survey and have been to London for 4  
 days with Shirwell,Berrynarbour and   
 Goodliegh schools.                    
    We have just come back from a      
 weekend camp under canvas in          
 Kentisbury's school field.            
    We had to put up and take down our 
 own tents and they were inspected     
 twice a day.We enjoyed the rock       
 climbing and making dams at Heddon's  
 Mouth.                                
    Next week Mr.Breeds the warden of  
 Braunton Burrows is coming to talk to 
 us and on Wednesday the whole school  
 will go for the day to the Burrows    
 and take a packed lunch and have a    
 swim in the sea if it is warm enough. </content>
