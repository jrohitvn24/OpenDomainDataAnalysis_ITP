		<content> LIFE IN THE EIGHTIES{BY E.R.BAXTER    
   We live in a period of much social  
 support.Though{poverty}is a relative  
 term,we,like other British people live
 in a time when nobody need be hungry  
 or in debt.The machine having taken   
 over much of the manual labour of     
 industry there is much higher         
 unemployment mainly amongst the       
 non_skilled workforce.Many people have
 much more leisure.These conditions    
 however,though previously an aim by   
 organised labour have not brought     
 about the expected happy              
 satisfaction.Most forms of crime have 
 increased markedly over the past two  
 decades. This is disturbing;          
 particularly attacks on the old, often
 in their own homes, for little sums of
 money, or even for no apparent motive 
 and assaults of a sexual nature on    
 children or women.                    </content>
