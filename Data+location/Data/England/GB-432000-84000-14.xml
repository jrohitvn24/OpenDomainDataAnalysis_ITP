 My hobbies in the 1980's              
                                       
 My hobbies are gym, Trampoling and    
 reading.  I took up trampoling because
 I went to watch my sister and I       
 thought it was good and so I started. 
 I have been going for about a year now
 and I am already a Southern and       
 British Champion.  I like trampolining
 and I think it is very good fun.  My  
 second hobby is gymnaastics I started 
 gymnastics when I saw it on the       
 television and I thought it was       
 really, really good.  I go to gym once
 a week and I go trampolining twice a  
 week.
