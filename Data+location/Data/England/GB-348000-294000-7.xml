   At 11-50am I am directed to a 999   
 call traced to a house 10 miles away, 
 the operator had only heard a gurgling
 noise! I arrive,expecting to find a   
 heart attack victim,but find that a 2 
 year old child had made the call!     
   After lunch I patrol the village,   
 providing a reassuring presence to the
 Public,and chatting to the locals A   
 relatively quiet afternoon means that 
 Iam able to return home at 5pm.       
   I relax at home,but just at bedtime 
 I am called by Headquarters asking me 
 to attend a Burglar Alarm.It is a     
 false alarm and I am able to return to
 bed still keeping an ear open for the 
 phone in case my day is not yet       
 finished.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
