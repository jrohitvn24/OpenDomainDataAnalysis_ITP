		<content>There are eight bells made in the year 
1404 until 1718.  The oldest bell is   
500 years old.  The youngest bell is   
200 years old.  The bells are as big as
a door, they weigh one ton.  The bells 
are not rung at present because the    
tower is in danger of crumbling.       
                                       
Two cleaners get paid to clean the     
church, but there are lots more who do 
it for nothing.  The whole village are 
fund raisers for Boxford Church.  The  
church belongs to the whole village.   
The church is hop0ing for 20,000 pounds
to restore the church.  The gardener   
has retired so they hire the           
contractors.  The old things in the    
church are the chests.  Inside the     
chests are the old bibles and hand     
bells.
