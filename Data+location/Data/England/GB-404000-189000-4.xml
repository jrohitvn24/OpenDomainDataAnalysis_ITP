		<title>04HOUSING IN RURAL NORTH WILTS</title>
		<content> There are very few houses in this     
 block. The houses, other than the     
 farmhouses, are spread along the B4040
 along with the public house, the      
 sub-post office cum general store, the
 telephone kiosk (complete with an     
 unusually coloured blue phone) and a  
 post box. Collections and deliveries  
 are once daily excluding Sundays. All 
 amenities on any large scale are at   
 least three miles distant.The houses  
 are all privately owned and the       
 majority of them are more than one    
 hundred years old.
