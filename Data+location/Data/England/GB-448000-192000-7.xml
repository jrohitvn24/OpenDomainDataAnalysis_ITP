		<title>07Bring Back Chinese Classes.</title>
		<content>    In June our local newspaper carried
 an article about{Chinese teaching}at  
 our school. Chinese is being dropped  
 from the timetable at John Mason      
 School because of staff cuts. The     
 Headmaster hopes to win financial     
 support and sponsorships which could  
 mean Chinese being offered to senior  
 pupils in all Abingdon schools.       
    Mr. Owen, the Headmaster says in a 
 letter to companies that 'John Mason  
 has stood out as one of only two or   
 three schools in Britain to teach     
 Chinese, a language spoken by almost a
 quarter of the worlds population.'    
    Until the decision was taken to    
 phase out Chinese about 30 third-year 
 pupils at the school were starting the
 subject. A dozen to 15 of those went  
 on to take 'O' levels or C.S.E.s and a
 handful continued to study for 'A'    
 levels.                               </content>
