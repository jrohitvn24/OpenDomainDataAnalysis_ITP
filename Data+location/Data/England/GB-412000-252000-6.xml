		<title>06DAIRY FARMING IN GRAFTON</title>
		<content> In the morning we wake up at half-past
 five and bring the cows in from a     
 field then we start milking. Milking  
 is done by electrically powered units 
 that suck the milk out of the cows    
 udders.  While they are being milked  
 we feed them with cake which is a     
 mixture of minerals and oats.  We     
 finish milking at seven a.m. The cows 
 go through some yards and into a      
 field. The field is sometimes divided 
 up with an electric fence so that the 
 cows don't have too much to eat. In   
 the afternoon we milk the cows at     
 three a.m. and finish at half-past    
 five. The milk tanker comes from the  
 milk marketing board and when it has  
 been to all the farms in his area he  
 goes to the dairy where the milk is   
 bottled up or he goes to the creamery 
 where the milk is made into cheese,   
 butter and yoghurt.                   </content>
