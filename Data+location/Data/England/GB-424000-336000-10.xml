		<content> The majority of houses in this area   
 are under a hundred years old and very
 few are over two hundred years old.   
 Many are old farmhouses or cottages   
 which belonged to the farm estates,   
 used for housing the farm labourers,  
 but they have now been renovated or   
 modernised. Farm buildings have been  
 turned into houses and there is a     
 house which was a Methodist Chapel.   
 The main material for roofing is      
 tiles. Blue tiles are used as they    
 seem to be of a better quality than   
 the red tiles which were brought in   
 around 100 years ago. Double glazing  
 and insulation have been innovations  
 into houses in the last ten years.    
 Double glazing is used for windows and
 doors to prevent draughts. Insulation 
 is in the form of foam in the roof and
 between the cavities of outside and   
 inside walls.                         </content>
