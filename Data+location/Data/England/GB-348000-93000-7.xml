		<content> There are two mills in our area:      
 Loders Mill and New Street Mill.      
 Loders Mill was used as a flour mill  
 until 1978 when the owner, H.Barnes,  
 died.They had to build a man made     
 river because the natural river was   
 too low to run the wheel.New Street   
 Mill now only runs on Wednesday. It   
 was never used as a business mill, it 
 has always been privately owned. It   
 is owned by P.C. Tomkins. Loders Mill 
 runs once a fortnight. When it was a  
 business it ran every day. H.Barnes   
 had his own fleet of heavy goods      
 vehicles. The owners are now the      
 Laskey family. The wheel is under     
 cover and the only way to get to the  
 wheel for maintenance is to go through
 a door in some panelling.The mill down
 New Street Lane runs off its own      
 stream from Eggardon Hill. Loders Mill
 is 150 years old.                     </content>
