		<title>05EARLY SCHOOLING IN CALOW</title>
		<content> The old school was built about 1870.  
 The children went there from 5 to 11  
 years of age.The vicar was the        
 Headmaster.There were wooden desks    
 with sloping lids and people carved   
 their names   in the wood.It was a    
 stone building with arched windows.   
 The toilets were outside,across the   
 playground.There were 4 classrooms.   
 The Church Hall across the road was   
 used for P.E. and Dancing. In P.E.you 
 did exercises and everyone did the    
 same thing. If you were naughty you   
 had the slipper or the cane.          
 Nearby was a field where you could  go
 for Nature Walks and find butterflies,
 mice and wild flowers.                
 Separate Infant and Junior Schools    
 were built when more people moved into
 the area.The old building is to be an 
 Activity Centre.There is already a    
 Boxing Club there.                    </content>
