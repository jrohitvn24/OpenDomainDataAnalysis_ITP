		<title>12A Day in a family in Banbury</title>
		<content>  Our family gets up and gets ready for
work. When we are ready my mum, dad and
I get in the car. It is about 7.50a.m. 
I get dropped off at my nan's until it 
is time to go to school.               
  (My sister goes to Stanbridge so she 
stays at home.)                        
  Then my mum and dad carry on to work.
My mum stays at work till 2 o'clock,   
but my dad stays till 4.30. They both  
work at Norbar, the tool company.      
  When it's ten to one my mum and dad  
have lunch.                            
  When it's about 2 o'clock my uncle   
picks my mum up from work. My mum may  
go down town or go home. Normally she  
goes home.                             
  I get in about 3.30. Samantha gets in
at 3.50 and my dad gets in at five     
o'clock. We have the dinner at about   
six o'clock.                           
                                       </content>
