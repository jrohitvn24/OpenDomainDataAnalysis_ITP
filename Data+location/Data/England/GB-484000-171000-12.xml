		<title>12THE SEWAGE WORKS</title>
		<content> The Hazelwood Lane Sewage Works was   
 opened in 1956 and deals with 3.5     
 million gallons of domestic and       
 industrial waste a day from the       
 Bracknell area. 18 people are employed
 at the  works: 6 staff members, 4     
 operators &amp; 8 fitters.                
 STAGES IN TREATMENT                   
 1.Sewage passes through an inlet into 
 channels where the grit falls to the  
 bottom.                               
 2.Primary Sedimentation. This is where
 the sludge is collected. After        
 treatment it is used as a fertiliser  
 and the methane produced is used as   
 a fuel.The water is then poured onto  
 media rocks in tanks 6 feet deep.     
 3.Secondary Sedimentation. The        
 remainder of the sludge falls to the  
 bottom. The water then passes through 
 micro-mesh before joining a nearby    
 tributary of the River Thames.        </content>
