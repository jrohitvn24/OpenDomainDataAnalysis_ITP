		<title>16Ravensburgh Castle</title>
		<content>{Ravensburgh Hillfort}is found at      
 (29,10). It was built on top of a hill
{154 m high}which is steepest on the   
 southern side and was built more than 
{2000 years ago.}Probably all the      
 people in our area lived there because
 its steep sides made it easy to       
 protect. Ravensburgh was constructed  
 by digging ditches round the hill with
 antlers and stone tools. Excavated    
 earth was piled up to make high walls.
 A strong wooden fence was built at the
 top{enclosing about 20 acres.}The huts
 inside were made from mud, stones and 
 thatch. Today it has not changed      
 greatly. The remains of the ditches   
 are still there but the hill is       
 covered in trees and brambles. You may
 only visit at certain times and with  
 permission of Mr Ashley Cooper who    
 owns the land now and uses it for     
 pheasant breeding and forestry.       </content>
