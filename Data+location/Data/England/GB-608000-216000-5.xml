		<content> The trees in our town are quite varied
 they include{Lime,Holly, Birches,Rowan
{,Hawthorn}and a few{Oaks.}However, we 
 found that the majority of our mature 
 trees are the broad leaved deciduous  
 type such as{Sycamore}and{Horse       
{chestnut.}These trees are well        
 established in various areas of the   
 town, with  a particularly fine old   
 Horse chestnut in{Victoria Place,}our 
 town centre. Around the old{Manor     
 estate lands we discovered many{Scots 
{Pines.}Many of our{Elms}have recently 
 been victims of{Dutch Elm}disease.An  
 unusual tree to be found here is the  
{Tasmanian Gum (Eucalyptus}),these owe 
 their presence to{John Bateman}who    
 lived here in the late 1800's. His    
 pastime was growing trees and he      
 imported the seeds and then planted   
 several woods on his lands.These trees
 are now an interesting feature.       </content>
