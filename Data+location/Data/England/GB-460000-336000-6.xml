		<title>06Nottingham Airport</title>
		<content>   {Nottingham Airport}is situated on  
 the road from Gamston to Tollerton. It
 was opened in 1930. It is not used as 
 an international airport but is used  
 for light aircraft and charter and    
 cargo work.                           
    The Airport covers 288 acres. On   
 this there are three runways going in 
 different directions. There are two   
 hangars where the aeroplanes are      
 stored and there is the control tower.
    How much the Airport is used       
 depends a bit on the weather but on an
 average day there are about 120       
 aeroplanes using the Airport. Twelve  
 people are employed there, including  
 the Director, the Air Traffic         
 Controller and mechanics who look     
 after the maintainance of the         
 aircraft.
