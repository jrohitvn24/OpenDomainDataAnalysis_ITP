		<title>07Lympstone-population.</title>
		<content>In 1931 the population of Lympstone was
1042 and it now stands at around 1860, 
a relatively high increase especially  
in the last 20 years.A recent survey   
showed that about 35% of those asked   
had lived there for less than 10 years 
which confirms that Lympstone has      
proved attractive to the retired and to
commuters working in Exeter.In East    
Devon,the 1981 census shows that 51% of
the people are over 65 years of age,the
figure here is lower but still worthy  
of note.Overall population density has 
also increased,helped by the building  
of estates,especially on the North side
for Royal Marine families.Many of the  
newcomers are from London,the South    
East and the Midlands but most         
migration has been from within Devon.
