This block  includes the large village 
of Chesterton together  with  farmland 
and hamlets to  the west  of it.   The 
settlements  in  this  area  owe their 
existance to  the  coal mined  here on 
part of the North  Staffordshire  coal 
field  and still retain  some of their 
original character, although the large 
centre  of  population, Chesterton, is 
now much influenced  by its  proximity 
to  the  town  of Newcastle-under-Lyme 
whose  borough council has  built  new 
large housing estates here.  The farm- 
land,  situated  at  the edge  of  the 
Cheshire  plain,    is   predominantly 
pasture.   Some  woodland  remains,  a 
reminder of the Lyme forest which used 
to cover  the  area.    The  landscape 
bears  the  scars  of  old  extractive 
industry and is soon to have new  ones 
added from open-cast mining.           </content>
