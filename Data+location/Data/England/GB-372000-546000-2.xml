		<content> Three kilometres from the town the    
 A689 road links up to the B6294 which 
 runs in a north westerly direction up 
 a steep incline.    To the south of   
 this road there is a steep slope down 
 which is mainly rough pasture land.   
 In the valley between the two roads   
 runs the{River Nent,}a tributary of   
 the River South Tyne.   There are     
 several small plantations, mainly of  
 conifers and the council tip is       
 situated in a disused quarry.   To the
 north of the B6294 lies the higher    
 ground of steep rocky pasture with    
 much evidence of past{mining          
 activities.    Beyond that lies a     
 large area of open moorland and bog.  
 Newshield Moss, rises to 1642 feet    
 above sea level and it is here that   
 the town's television mast is located.
