		<content>    Cambridge has much marshy fen by   
 the river -Coe Fen (formerly Cow Fen),
 Lammas land and Sheep's Green -which  
 have been used for hundreds of years  
 as common grazing land by the people  
 of Cambridge. Although part of it has 
 been drained and cultivated for a     
 public park,horses and cows are still 
 grazed on the remainder thus          
 preserving the natural balance of     
 vegetation. This grazing is regulated 
 by an official who bears the ancient  
 title of City Pinder.                 
    The River Cam (or Granta) meanders 
 northwards through the Fen. In summer 
 there is rowing and punting on the    
 river and picnicking in the meadows.  
 Coe Fen has an interesting nature     
 trail. You can see oak,alder,lime and 
 willow trees-water figwort,buttercups,
 ragwort,willowherb and water forget-  
 me-nots.                              </content>
