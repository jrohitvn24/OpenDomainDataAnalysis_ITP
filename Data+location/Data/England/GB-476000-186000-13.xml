		<title>13Children and Leisure.</title>
		<content>The children aged 11 and 12 years old  
spend their leisure time in a variety  
of ways.Bicycle rides are very popular 
and in the summer the children spend as
much time as possible out of doors.As  
there are many private swimming pools  
in the locality,swimming facilities are
available to many children because     
their parents work for the owners.     
Parents also pay for private swimming  
tuition.                               
  Football is a popular pastime with   
the boys even in summer.They also spend
many hours in the woods,walking the dog
or climbing trees.                     
 Nearly all the children are members of
a Monday youth group when the leader   
organises games and outings to an ice- 
rink or places of interest.Some boys   
help on the farm feeding calves and    
also help dad in the garden.Summer     
school courses are also popular.       </content>
