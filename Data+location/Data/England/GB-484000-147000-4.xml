 1984, with a 75% grant from Surrey and
 Waverley council. The other 25% was   
 raised by people living in the area.  
 The hall has a timber frame which is  
 surrounded by brick.The roof is       
 covered with{Redland Tile.}On the     
 inside the walls are covered in       
 insulated plaster board.The land on   
 which it is built is leased by        
 Waverley for Â£600 per annum.          
    Professional plumbers, bricklayers,
 heating engineers and electricians    
 did most of the construction and      
 fitting but the rest was done by      
 village people.

 and is used by many groups such as    
 guides, jujitsu, baby clinic, Darby   
 and Joans, bingo, ballet, dance,      
 Sunday school and also for weddings,  
 discos and parties.                   </content>
