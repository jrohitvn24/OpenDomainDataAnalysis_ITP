		<title>04RIDDLESDEN CRICKET CLUB</title>
		<content>    Riddlesden has one cricket club, on
 Grange Road, that has been in use from
 1889.  The club hut was made by the   
 members only.  It has been there for  
 4/5 years.  The people who run the    
 club do not know who opened the       
 grounds, they were actually opened    
 about 1819.  The members at the time  
 decided to have it where it is.       
    The cricket members have to pay    
 Â£1000 a year to run it.               
    There was another  Riddlesden Club 
 near Bensons.  Farmland was there     
 before the club.  The members have    
 owned the club for about 3 years.     
 There are about 25-30 cricketers.     
 They play on Saturday and Sunday.  The
 ground takes up 2/3 acres.
