   Our marked area consisted of many   
 fields,the majority of which were     
 unsown grasslands,fenced and generally
 used for grazing.There was a large    
 number of open fields,which often ran 
 up the side of hills and had been sown
 and fertilized with the intention of  
 being used as silage or hay.We also   
 noted several fields which consisted  
 of crops,other than grass,such as     
 wheat and barley.In the far corner of 
 our area there was a significant      
 ammount of woodland,dominated by      
 conifers.                             
   Running round many of the fields    
 were small brooks,and in some fields, 
 especially grazing fields,there were  
 artifical ponds from which the animals
 drank,even though many of them        
 were heavily polluted.
