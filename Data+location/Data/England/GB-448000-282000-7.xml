		<content> WATLING FARM. Arable &amp; beef fattening.
 A herd of 100 bulls, permenately      
 housed under the countryside safety   
 regulations Act, fatten quickly &amp; are 
 ready for slaughter at 14 months. An  
 intensive farming method.             
 PAILTON PASTURES FARM. Once the       
 pastureland for Pailton village. A    
 mixed HOME FARM for their own acreage 
 &amp; three others they managed for the   
 Denbeigh Estate, under a share partner
 -ship scheme. All the storage is here,
 a very large venture. The new owner   
 came in 1967, the farmer's wife enjoys
 the solitary situation &amp; busy home    
 life. The children attend Monks Kirby 
 schools. Main shopping expeditions are
 to Birmingham or Milton Keynes, the A5
 trunk road seeming to form a natural  
 barrier for business &amp; social         
 activities.
