		<content>The Enterprise Zone covers a small part
of our area to the south.It has been   
established in order to cut red tape   
and provide major financial and tax in-
centives during the next few years to  
1992.The government is presently spend-
ing 200 million pounds to help create  
a modern infrastructure of utilities,  
transportation and telecommunications  
in Docklands.Plans include the a new   
Light Railway,satellite earth stations 
and a short take off and landing(STOL) 
airport as well as a new water bus     
service on the Thames.There are also to
be numerous environmental improvements 
with new recreational and leisure faci-
lities.The scale of activity in this   
new visionary environment of tomorrow, 
in the heart of a major capital city,  
proves its potential now as one of the 
most exciting places to be.
