		<title>06GLYNDE CHURCH</title>
		<content> Glynde church is different from other 
 churches in strange ways. It has a    
 flattish roof which is unusual, for   
 most churches have a roof which slants
 up to a point. It was built in 1763.  
 It took from 1763 - 1765 to           
 build. That was when they changed it  
 because the first one was built long  
 before. It was built by{Richard       
{Trevor,}Bishop of Durham. Inside it   
 has pews with doors to get into them. 
 There are some stairs going up into a 
 balcony with an organ up there. It has
 two doors, the outer doors which are  
 wooden and rather heavy. The inner    
 door is a network of metal. The vicar 
 is the vicar of{Beddingham, Firle}and 
 Glynde. He lives in Firle. South of   
 the church is a bank of daffodils in  
 spring. Glynde parish church is next  
 to Glynde place.
