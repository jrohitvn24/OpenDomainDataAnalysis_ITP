		<title>06A HILL FARM IN LYDFORD</title>
		<content>   This is a farm of 270acres run by   
 the farmer and one part time helper.  
 It is all grazing land except for some
 hayfields and there are three barns   
 for storing mainly bought straw and   
 hay and for wintering the stock.      
   About 400 Blackface Suffolk and     
 Cheviot sheep are kept for wool and   
 for lambs which are sold at Market.   
 Seventy Galloway Hereford crosses and 
 Angus Friesian crosses are kept for   
 raising calves which will be sold for 
 fattening after two years.            
   The land rises to about 1000 ft. and
 trees, hedges and gorse are used to   
 provide shelter in bad weather. Not   
 much machinery is needed as there is  
 no cultivation. There is mains water  
 and several springs and streams but no
 electricity, so shearing is done with 
 power from generators.                
                                       </content>
