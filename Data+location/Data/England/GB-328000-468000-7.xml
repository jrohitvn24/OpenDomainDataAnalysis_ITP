		<title>07SHRIMP FISHING CONTINUED</title>
		<content> Obviously the tractor can't operate in
 water  this deep so they have a clever
 system which locks the trailers wheels
 in a straight  line.  The tractor then
 pulls at an angle,  out  of  the  main
 channel of  water  on  the  end  of  a
 hundred metres  of  rope, a bit like a
 barge on a  canal.  The tractors  have
 platforms on the  back  and  sides  on
 which the catch is  carried. They only
 work at low tide. It is a  smelly job 
 for them. In one catch they caught two
 and  a half containers full. It was 80
 pounds  worth.  When  they  go  shrimp
 fishing  the  nets  also  catch crabs,
 sand-dabs, flukes  and  alsorts.  They
 sort out the shrimps and put the other
 small fish back into  the  sea  to let
 them  grow. The  shrimps  have  to  be
 taken  out of their shells before they
 can be sold.
