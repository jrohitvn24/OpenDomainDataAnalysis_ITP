		<title>13FAMILY ROLES</title>
		<content> We conducted a survey to find out the 
roles of the different members of the  
family in our area of Ladywood.These   
are the results of our research:       
Jobs undertaken predominantly by women:
   washing,ironing,washing-up,cleaning 
   the house,shopping for food         
Jobs undertaken predominantly by men:  
   decorating,gardening,car-washing    
Jobs undertaken by children:           
   babysitting,shopping,washing-up     
Our research showed that most domestic 
jobs are carried out by the women,even 
though a high percentage of them have  
part-time jobs.                        
   Babysitting is mostly done by young 
girls and boys.Children share a lot of 
the men's and women's work.
