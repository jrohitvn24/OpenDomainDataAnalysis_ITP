		<title>03WEATHERHEAD HIGH SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Our school began in 1883. One of the  
 men who founded it was Canon          
 Weatherhead. His daughter Irene was a 
 good pupil. The school first rented   
 rooms in Liscard but in 1890 it moved 
 to two houses in Manor Road. These    
 houses are called Manor Mansions now. 
 They are flats for 12 families and    
 owned by Mr. Rubens. In 1909 the      
 school moved to a purpose built site  
 in Manor Road. We still use this site 
 today as our middle site. Old school  
 magazines are in our library. In 1952 
 we found out that there was a French  
 exchange with a  school from Cognac.  
 Today a French teacher from Cognac    
 still brings French children to stay  
 in Wallasey. In 1964 the uniform was  
 like ours today, but the prefects had 
 badges.                               
 Our form captains wear badges now.
