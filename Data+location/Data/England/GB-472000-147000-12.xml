 WHEN WE MADE A STUDY OF THE TYPES OF  
 TRANSPORT IN OUR AREA WE DISCOVERED   
 THAT NEARLY EVERY FAMILY HAD A CAR.   
 THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE, MOSTLY THE    
 ELDERLY WHO HAD TO RELY ENTIRELY ON   
 PUBLIC TRANSPORT.  IT DID NOT SURPRISE
 US THAT THERE WERE SO MANY CARS       
 BECAUSE THE AREA IS SO ISOLATED  AND  
 PEOPLE NEED A FORM OF TRANSPORT TO GO 
 SHOPPING OR FIND ENTERTAINMENT AND THE
 PUBLIC BUS SERVICE ONLY GOES THROUGH  
 OUR AREA ONCE A WEEK.  WE DID A       
 TRAFFIC COUNT ON THE COUNTRY ROAD NEAR
 OUR SCHOOL AND FOUND THAT DURING A SIX
 HOUR PERIOD FROM 9 A.M. TO 3 P.M.     
 THERE WERE ONLY 47  CARS, 6 LORRIES, 4
 MOTOR BIKES AND 9 BIKES.  ON THE ONE  
 MAIN ROAD THAT GOES THROUGH OUR BLOCK 
 THERE IS MUCH MORE TRAFFIC BECAUSE IT 
 LEADS TO THE M3 MOTORWAY ABOUT 3      
 MILES AWAY.                           </content>
