		<content> The Pubs often provide entertainment  
 with a piano, a Juke Box or a Fruit   
 Machine. Games like Dominoes and Darts
 are played. Beer Gardens where people 
 can take their children for a family  
 outing are becoming more popular.     
 Children still entertain themselves   
 with the same games. Games like Tag,  
 Hide and Seek which were played over  
 60 years ago in the Junior School     
 which is 64 years old this year (1985)
 are still played by today's children. 
 Other well known games are a type of  
 marbles called 'Blobby Three Hole'    
 played with 3 holes instead of 1 and  
 'Monty Bitty' where one team of       
 children mounted on their team mates  
 backs try to knock off their opponents
 from the other team.                  
 This area has changed a lot over the  
 last 20 years and many pits have      
 closed.                               </content>
