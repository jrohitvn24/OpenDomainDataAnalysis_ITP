		<content> Fletcher Fold School is a special     
 school for the{handicapped.}There are 
 six classrooms, and eight children in 
 each of them. There are forty-eight   
 children in the whole school.         
 The handicaps are{blindness, deafness,
{spasticity,}and some of the children  
 cannot walk. Fletcher Fold is         
 different from an ordinary school, and
 the subjects the children do differ   
 because of their handicap. Some of the
 doors are big because of wheelchairs. 
 The school was built in 1976 and took 
 two years to build.                   
 There are seven teachers,( six ladies 
 and one man ).
