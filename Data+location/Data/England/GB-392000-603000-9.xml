 post-bus leaves at 11.30 and comes

    Most of the children travel into   
 school by car.One car covers up the   
 Coquet,Alwin Valley and Clennell      
 area, one the Dueshill and Holystone  
 area and the other the Sharperton and 
 Holystone area.Some parents living    
 within the two mile radius transport  
 their own children.                   
   The nearest railway station is at
