		<title>17THE SITE OF ORMSKIRK</title>
		<content> Although not very high above sea      
 level, Ormskirk is relatively higher  
 than the plain surrounding it.The     
 early site was on a sandstone outcrop 
 overlooking the low land to the west. 
 To the east the land was relatively   
 level therefore this provided at dry  
 commanding view of the surroundings.  
   On a clear day from the top of the  
 parish church you can see for miles.  
 To the north you can easily see the   
 Ribble estuary and the large town of  
 Preston 20 miles away and on very     
 clear days you can see to the Lake    
 District Fells and the Langdale       
 Mountains.                            
   To the west and the north west you  
 can see Southport and in the winter on
 a clear night you can see the         
 illuminations at Blackpool.
