		<title>06HOMES IN SPETISBURY.</title>
		<content>  Our cottage is about 2OO years old.It
 is built of cob which is a mixture of 
 chalk,cow dung,straw and horse        
 hair.Many cottages in Spetisbury have 
 the same construction and some still  
 have their thatched roofs.We have     
 extended and modernised our cottage to
 make it more comfortable to live      
 in.Many other people have also        
 improved old houses ans many like us  
 were not born in Spetisbury but come  
 from other parts of the country.There 
 are also new modern bungalows in      
 Priory Gardens and Abbey View.My      
 son's grandmother lives in one of     
 these.Some are occupied by retired    
 people like her but people with young 
 families also live in them.
