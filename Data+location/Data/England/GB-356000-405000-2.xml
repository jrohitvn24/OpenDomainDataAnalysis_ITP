		<title>02THE WIGAN PIER COMPLEX #1</title>
		<content>  It used to be considered a joke about
 Wigan having a{"Pier"}but throughout{ 
 Wigan's industrial history{coal}has   
 always played a very important part.  
 Much of this coal was delivered to    
 Wigan Pier on the{Leeds - Liverpool   
{Canal.}The term Wigan Pier Complex has
 been given because of the importance  
 of Wigan Pier over many years.        
  Wigan Pier was one of several canal  
 piers built to serve local collieries.
 Coal would be transported along a     
 "wagon road" and then onto a railway  
 down to the banks of the canal. From  
 here coal would be taken by barge to  
{Liverpool}and much of it exported to  
{Ireland}and the{U.S.A.                
  The Pier was one of the last still   
 working. Built in{1822}by T.Claughton 
 to serve his pits, it was linked to   
 other pits in 1842 and demolished in  
{1929}for a total scrap value of Â£34.  </content>
