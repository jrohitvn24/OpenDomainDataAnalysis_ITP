		<content> ed detached and semidetached houses   
 and bungalows have mushroomed in      
 Birkenshaw.These houses are mostly    
 brick built but some have Stonefaced  
 fronts and some are pebbledashed.     
   In Hazel Close the bungalows are for
 senior citizens built in aid of the   
 Flower Fund appeal by Miss Chanter,   
 Mayoress.                             
{  Gomersal}is a semi-rural village    
 within easy reach of the cities of    
 Leeds,Bradford and Wakefeild.The      
 motorway network is also very         
 close.The village is quiet because it 
 hasn't any large amenities and there  
 are no big factories to pollute the   
 air.The housing is a mixture of old   
 and new with some houses dating from  
 the 17th century.
