		<title>05Rainford Principle Features</title>
		<content>   Rainford only has two principle     
 features,the white statues and the    
 stocks.                               
   The white statues are situated at   
 the south end of Church Road,and they 
 have an interesting story behind them.
   They used to be gateposts for a     
 school called Image House Academy,a   
 school for boys,which 17 pupils       
 attended.They depict the gods Mars and
 Minerva.The reason they are quite far 
 apart is because carriages would have 
 ridden in and out.                    
   In 1952,the year of Queen Elizabeth 
 II's coronation,the statues were      
 painted in the colours of the Union   
 Jack.Rainford's stocks may not have   
 been genuine.They may have never been 
 used at all.The stones at either side 
 are probably genuine,but the wood was 
 replaced by Winstanleys the builders  
 in around 1950.                       </content>
