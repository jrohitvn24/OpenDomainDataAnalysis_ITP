Although predominantly residential the 
area has always been important for     
public open spaces. At the beginning of
century trains, and later, trams       
brought people from urban Woolwich to  
the "countryside" of Abbey Wood. Today 
one can still walk almost the complete 
width of the area through parks and    
woodland.                              
                                       
A light industrial area was opened on  
the Abbey Wood Estate in the sixties   
but with the current economic recession
most units are empty.                  
                                       
The people of the area are also varied.
White working class families are in the
majority but there is a large Asian    
population (especially Plumstead) and  
Abbey Wood has the largest Gypsy       
Traveller site in Britain.             </content>
