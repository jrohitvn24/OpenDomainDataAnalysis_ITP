    My school has five classes there   
 is a library, a hall, two playgrounds,
 a large field with a steep slope that 
 falls away from the playground, an    
 indoor learner swimming pool and a    
 small fish pond that leaks, there are 
 lots of man-hole covers where we play 
 marbles, this is our favourite game.  
  The main building dates from 1847 and
 houses the hall, two classrooms for   
 the Infants, the office, staff-room   
 and cloakrooms. There are three wooden
 huts for the Juniors, my class is     
 called Class 1 and the classroom hut  
 is three years old. The School has a  
 team for Athletics, Football, Netball 
 and Stoolball who enter the local     
 Tournaments. We have a Swimming Gala  
 and give Concerts to our Parents. At  
 Christmas the Service of Nine Lessons 
 and Carols is held in the Church.     </content>
