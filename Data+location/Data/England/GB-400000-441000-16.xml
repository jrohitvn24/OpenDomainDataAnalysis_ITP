		<content>   A resident of Whitley Head,which is 
 two rows of houses about half a mile  
 out of Steeton,is so enthusiastic     
 about railways that he has a railway  
 engine in his back garden.            
   The engine is a Deltaic Diesel,     
 which is approximately 22 years old.It
 was used for pulling the main express 
 engines in Britain,including the      
 Flying Scotsman.It was one of the most
 powerful engines ever built.This      
 engine and twenty-one other similar   
 diesel engines were built to replace  
 fifty-four steam engines and this     
 shows how powerful they were.The      
 engine originated from Doncaster      
 where it was built in 1963.           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
