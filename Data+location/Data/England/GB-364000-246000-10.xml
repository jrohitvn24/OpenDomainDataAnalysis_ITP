		<title>10CHURCH IN BISHOPS FROME</title>
		<content> Bishops Frome Parish Church, dedicated
 to St. Mary the Virgin, can be traced 
 back to 12th century. The architecture
 is Transitional (Norman and early     
 English). Built mainly of local       
 sandstone rubble with dressings, and  
 with tiled roof, it comprises a       
 Chancel, Lady Chapel on the north     
 side, Western Tower and South Porch.  
 Set is a well tended churchyard of    
 some 2 acres, the church stands above 
 the surrounding area, and to the east 
 the glebe-land stretches down to the  
 River Frome. The 56ft west tower,     
 dated about 1340, with walls 4ft      
 thick, contains a ring of six bells   
 and a sanctus bell. These were        
 installed in 1975 to replace the      
 originals. The church is one of five  
 served by Rev. George Talbot who lives
 in the modern rectory. Each sunday at 
 10am, a Holy Communion Service is held</content>
