		<title>17MOORSIDE EDGE TRANSMITTER.</title>
		<content> The Moorside Edge radio transmitter   
 was opened on May 17th.1931.It stands 
 in 35 acres of moorland bought from   
 the Dartmouth Estate.Originally it    
 broadcast the Home and North Regional 
 Service to much of Northern England   
 and was Britain's largest transmitter.
     As the site is 330 metres above   
 sea-level and the twin masts rise to  
 150 metres,they can be seen from many 
 miles away.These masts are built on   
 huge concrete pivots to allow for     
 swing in windy conditions.In 1984 the 
 masts were repositioned so the signals
 would cover the required area more    
 satisfactorily.Both masts now transmit
 Radio 2.Parallel wires down each side 
 transmit Radio 1 and 3 to Yorkshire,  
 Lancashire,Cheshire,Cumbria,Durham,   
 Lincolnshire,Derbyshire,Staffordshire 
 and North Wales.By 1990,the station   
 will be unmanned and fully automatic. </content>
