		<content> We went to Greenwoods Stock to meet   
 Reverend Russell Warden to go inside  
 Christ Church Stock in the Church     
 there is a small Platform with Carpet 
 on it, lift that up and take away the 
 boards and the beams to support it and
 there is a big round pool about 10    
 foot in Diameter and 5 foot deep with 
 Spiral stairs going down this is for  
 completely submerged Baptism.         
 We went through a door in the church  
 which lead to a Sunday School room    
 where the children come for Sunday    
 School half way through the Service.  
 In the room is a passage going down to
 another room with french windows in it
 Through the windows you can see the   
 Telephone Exchange,Stock Library used 
 to be the old Exchange.When they were 
 building the new one the Bulldozers   
 dug up lots of{GRAVES}and split the   
{COFFINS}so they had to move the site. </content>
