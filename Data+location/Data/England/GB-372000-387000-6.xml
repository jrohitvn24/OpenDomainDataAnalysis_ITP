		<title>06THE SCOUT CAMP DUNHAM MASSEY</title>
		<content> Dumham Massey scout camp is just      
 outside the walls of the park.  The   
 camp has a big flag pole which you can
 see from the A56, an assault course   
 which is mainly made of wood and a    
 tree house with a rope ladder.  The   
 assault course has a river which is   
 very muddy and this runs through the  
 middle of the course.  Over this river
 is a rope swing and if you don't swing
 over you get very muddy.  The camp    
 also has a place for a big camp fire  
 and round the outside of the camp     
 there is a wood.                      
 To get to the camp you can go         
 through the park and over a stile, but
 sometimes the stile is blocked and the
 steps taken away.  You can also get to
 the camp from the A56 turning off and 
 going along a very narrow,bumpy       
 road.The camp is used for weekend,and 
 one week stays-also one day events.   </content>
