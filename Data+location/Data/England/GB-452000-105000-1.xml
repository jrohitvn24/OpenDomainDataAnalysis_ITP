		<content>  The area which was studied for our   
 part in the Domesday Project included 
 the village of Titchfield and the     
 Catisfield district of Fareham. This  
 is part of the country mid-way        
 between the cities of Southampton and 
 Portsmouth. Parts of the district are 
 rural and there are also urban areas  
 in which commuters to London live.    
 The river Meon cuts through the land  
 on its way to the sea at Hill Head.   
 There is a mixture of agriculture and 
 light industry.The major employers are
 Plesseys, manufacturers of electronic 
 equipment, and the Office of          
 Population Census and surveys, whose  
 national headquarters is within our   
 area. There is a mixture of ancient   
 and modern building ranging from a    
 Norman church to houses built within  
 the past year.                        
                                       </content>
