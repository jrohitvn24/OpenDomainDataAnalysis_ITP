		<content>There are several places in and around 
Stone where one can dine out in        
elegant, pleasant surroundings.In the  
High Street is the Crown Hotel,formerly
a coaching inn but now a spacious hotel
recommended by both the A.A.and R.A.C. 
It consists of the Harding Room for    
dinner dances, parties, etc., the      
Jervis Room for small parties,the Oak  
Panelled restaurant,the Ballroom,      
lounge bars and luxurious bedrooms.    
The Mill,in Mill Street,was originally 
a corn mill,but now serves three       
course meals plus a variety of         
wines.Wedding parties are also catered 
for.In its days as a working mill the  
first sack  of Hovis flour was ground  
there. The Darlaston Inn and the       
Wayfarer, both situated on the main    
A.34,are traditional pub restaurants   
where you dine or visit for a drink.For
