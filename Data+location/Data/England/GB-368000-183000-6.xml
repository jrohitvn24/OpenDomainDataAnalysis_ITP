		<content> Yate C.P.School is very small compared
 with most modern schools.It is 135    
 years old.It was the old school that  
 served the old village of Yate before 
 any of the new housing estates were   
 built.At the school,children do maths,
 english,science, different topics,and 
 sports.These include football,netball,
 rounders, nonstop cricket,gymnastics  
 and athletics.These are some of the   
 topics that have been studied in the  
 last two years: Minibeasts,Mexico,    
 Early This Century,Prehistory,Space,  
 India,The Middle Ages,and The Domesday
 Project.Out of the 46 children at the 
 school,24 have school dinners,17 have 
 sandwiches and 5 go home to have      
 dinner.There is one other primary     
 school in the area and that is Iron   
 Acton School and it is even smaller.At
 the age of 11,most children go to     
 Brimsham Green Comprehensive School.  </content>
