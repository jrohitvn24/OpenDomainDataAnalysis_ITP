		<content> The Memorial Hall has been standing   
 for about 56 years.In 1932 the{Prince 
{of Wales}visited and opened it.There  
 are lots of things going on in        
 there,these are some of them:         
 Guides,jumble-sales, fetes and galas  
 and lots more things.At the back of   
 the Memorial Hall the grass is quite  
 high.When it was first built the      
 plantation was beautiful.The Guides   
 some-times have  barbeques on the     
 playing field by the hall.Many people 
 play on the park at the bottom of the 
 field.                                
 At the top of the field there are some
{Gypsy caravans.}There used to be a    
 very vicious dog there but it died a  
 few years ago.Some of the kids from   
 the village play foot-ball,cricket,and
 rounders,on the field as well we all  
 share our fun there."ITS GREAT".
