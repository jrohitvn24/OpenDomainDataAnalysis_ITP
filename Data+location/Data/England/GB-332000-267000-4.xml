		<title>04ECOLOGY. TREES WILLEY.</title>
		<content> Willey is a saxon word meaning willow 
 wood but today there are few willows  
 left in the area. These are white     
 willows. The most common trees are    
 holly,elder, hazel, and hawthorn which
 were originally planted for hedging   
 but are now growing wild as well.The  
 vallet woods are planted with Sitka   
 spruce, European larch &amp; Tsuga but    
 there are other trees such as oak,    
 beech, ash, birch, sycamore and elm   
 although the latter are all now dead  
 from dutch elm disease. The area also 
 has a number of wild cherry trees and 
 at Cwm Crave a fine lime tree grows.  
 Of the walnut trees once in the area, 
 few now remain. The 3rd oldest oak    
 tree in Hereford is situated at Willey
 Hall and is regularly inspected by    
 county officials.
