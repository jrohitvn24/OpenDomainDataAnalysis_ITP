		<content> The Post Office is run by Mrs Hall who
 has worked there for 3 years.  Her    
 family have run it since 1937/8.  It  
 opens every day from 9am-5/30pm except
 Thursday when it closes at 12 noon and
 Saturday at l2.30pm.  Mondays and     
 Thursday mornings are the busiest     
 times when people come for their      
 pensions.  On an average Monday there 
 are 30-40 customers.  People use the  
 Post Office for buying stamps and     
 posting letters.  It has 2 collections
 a day.  It is also used for paying    
 bills and TV licences and for         
 collecting pensions and family        
 allowances.  Mrs Hall balances the    
 books every Friday and sends the      
 returns off to Worcester.  There is a 
 public telephone box outside the Post 
 Office.
