		<content> The owner-occupied{Burford Estate     
 were better cared for and therefore   
 looked never. Welland was only        
 completed, however, about seven years 
 ago. There are also 2 mobile home     
 parks in our area- Keys and Tasman    
 parks. Tasman has been there for about
 37 years starting off with 7 old      
 caravans on a disused farm. Keys park 
 is much larger with 79 mobile homes.  
 Each has a colourful,well-kept        
 garden. There is even a pond and      
 fountain. The park was bright,        
 friendly and cheerful and has been    
 there for twenty years. It is owned by
 Godfrey Davin park homes.  People live
 here because it is cheaper then buying
 a house. Everything necessary is      
 provided except a fridge, washing     
 machine, hoover and personal things   
 such as ornaments, sheets etc....
