		<title>04MARKETING THE BLAISDON PLUM</title>
		<content> The crop comes anytime from mid August
 -mid September, the earliest ever     
 recorded was 9th August 1957 when     
 the Walton's son was born. All is {   
{"Plum Fever" }for the next fortnight  
 when the lorries arrive daily from the
 canners and jammers. The local jam    
 factory has closed but Marks and      
 Spencers still make jam at Ledbury and
 Robertson's use Blaisdons exclusively.
 The plums are packed in 56lb boxes and
 due to E.E.C. regulations are graded  
 for size before going to market.      
 Unfortunately many plums not wanted by
 the manufacturers do not satisfy the  
 standards and rot on the ground. The  
 village has a biennial{Plum festival  
 with displays of crafts and flowers   
 and of course plums! This year        
 promises a bumper crop.
