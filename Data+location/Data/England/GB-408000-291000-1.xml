		<title>01SUMMARY ERDINGTON</title>
		<content> The area we have covered is part of a 
 large residential suburb of Birmingham
 As such it is fairly uniform in       
 character, consisting of houses, both 
 council owned and private, and        
 amenities such as parks, sports       
 grounds and shopping centres.  Of     
 course there have been changes over   
 the years not only in the environment 
 but in the people who come to live    
 here.  As a large industrial city,    
 Birmingham has always attracted people
 who come to live and work here.       
 Amongst those who have made their     
 homes here are people from all over   
 Britain and major ethnic groups       
 including West Indians, Asians and    
 Chinese.  No major industry is        
 situated in our part of Erdington     
 although nearby there are many large  
 factories.  In our part of Erdington  
 small factories can be found.         </content>
