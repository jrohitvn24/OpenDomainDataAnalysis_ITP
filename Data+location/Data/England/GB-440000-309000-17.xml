		<title>17IBSTOCK - FAMOUS FOR BRICKS</title>
		<content>   It is not surprising that anyone who
 thinks of{Ibstock}thinks of bricks.   
 For the works that have brought a     
 certain amount of fame to the village 
 makes an incredible sixty million     
 bricks a year.                        
   The four hundred acre site of       
 Ibstock Building Products Ltd., as the
 company is known today, lies on the   
 outskirts of the village on the road  
 to Ellistown.                         
   The site is unique in that it has   
 three distinct and separate layers of 
 clay - white, buff and red - and all  
 three main brick-making techniques    
 take place there - handmade, pressed  
 and extruded.                         
   The site originated in 1825 when the
 major part of the business was        
 coal-mining. The small brickworks     
 would only be intended to provide     
 bricks for the mine workings.         </content>
