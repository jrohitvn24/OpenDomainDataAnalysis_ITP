		<title>09MOVING ABOUT IN COOKLEY</title>

     Transport in the area for those   
 without a car is very difficult.      
 Although the village is very near the 
 town of {Kidderminster}with its bus   
 station and British Rail station,     
 Cookley is rather isolated.           
  The main Wolverhampton road passes   
 nearby,but only one bus service uses  
 it. A bus runs from Cookley to        
 Kidderminster rather infrequently and 
 it is very expensive, especially for a
 family.                               
   As a result many of the children    
 rarely visit Kidderminster or the     
 larger areas of population, such as   
 Wolverhampton and Birmingham which are
 easily accessible by car, and are thus
 denied access to museums,art galleries
 and cinemas etc.
