		<title>13Employment in Chelmsley Wood</title>
		<content> The Careers Office was opened in 1977 
 and is staffed by Careers Officers    
 with their support staff. They deal   
 mainly with school leavers but older  
 people also seek assistance. Numbers  
 dealt with range from 50(after        
 christmas) to 265(beginning of June   
 when school leavers apply).           
      Careers Officers claim a         
 placement rate of 65-70%, mainly in   
 clerical, retail or construction work.
      In addition the Job Centre,      
 opened in 1976, deals with about 1,000
 enquiries per week. Many more peruse  
 the notice boards. Jobs on offer      
 average 35 weekly in the neighbourhood
 and 150 shared with other Centres.    
 Local employment is found in          
 hospitals, hotels, airport and N.E.C.
