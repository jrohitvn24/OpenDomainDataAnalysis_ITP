		<content> The majority of the people which we   
 interviewed had been living in the    
 Heanor area for over ten years. We    
 asked each of them if they liked it in
 this area. They mostly said yes, but  
 they disliked the lack of buses and   
 the hills seemed to be a problem      
 because every thing was uphill. But   
 despite that they said that they were 
 pleased and reasonably happy with the 
 area. The main thing which attracted  
 them to the area was the lack of      
 traffic and the peacefulness. The     
 opencast did not seem to affect       
 most of the people interviewed. Most  
 of the houses consist of three or more
 bedrooms and most houses had a garage,
 though there are some areas of much   
 older housing. They were reasonably   
 happy with the gardens, though they   
 were a bit on the small side. Most    
 residents are workers and their family</content>
