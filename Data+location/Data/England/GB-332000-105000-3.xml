		<content> Tatworth has four places of worship.  
 The Anglican Church of St John the    
 Evangelist, situated on the edge of   
 the village nearest Chard, has a      
 Priest-in-Charge. A Church Room, for  
 use by the community, has recently    
 been erected by voluntary labour.     
                                       
 Tatworth Baptist Chapel is at Chard   
 Junction, and the Strict Baptists have
 a chapel in School Lane.              
                                       
 The South Chard Christian Church, also
 in School Lane, offers a less formal  
 gospel-style worship and attracts     
 people from all over the country.
