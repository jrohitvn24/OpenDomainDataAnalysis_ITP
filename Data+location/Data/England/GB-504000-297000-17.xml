		<title>17WANSFORD MAJOR ROAD TRAFFIC</title>
		<content>  The village of Wansford lies near the
 junction of two major trunk roads, the
 A1 and the A47.                       
  The A1 carries a very heavy flow of  
 traffic along its north - south route 
 between London and Scotland. A large  
 proportion of the traffic passing     
 Wansford consists of heavy goods      
 vehicles.                             
  The A47 also carries considerable    
 numbers of heavy goods vehicles since 
 it is the major trunk route between   
 the East Midlands and the ports of the
 east coast.                           
  At the intersection of the two roads 
 a fly-over has been built to take the 
 A47 over the A1, but despite this     
 improvement to the road layout there  
 are still many accidents at this busy 
 intersection.                         
                                       
                                       </content>
