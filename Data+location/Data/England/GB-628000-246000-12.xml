		<content>   At{Sutton Hoo,}the richest treasure 
 yet discovered on British soil was    
 excavated in{1939.}An{Anglo_Saxon}    
 ship, about 29m long and              
 clinker_built, was used to hold a     
 burial chamber. There were, however,  
 no human remains, meaning that the    
 whole affair was a{cenotaph.}So rich  
 were the jewels and treasures         
 discovered, that there is little doubt
 that it was for a{king.               
{}                                     
{  The remains have told historians    
{much about the period, they include: a
{musical instrument, a helmet, a       
{standard and thirty_seven coins _ the 
{latter were especially useful to      
{historians.                           
   The treasures are now in the British
 Museum, with replicas in the local    
 museum in Ipswich.
