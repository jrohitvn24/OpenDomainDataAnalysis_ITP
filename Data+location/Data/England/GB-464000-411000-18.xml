		<content> Stainforth in 1985 has a very limited 
 range of employment. The pit is the   
 major local employer with around 1300 
 employees.Our small survey of 67      
 families showed that about 40% were   
 without work.Many people have to find 
 work outside the village.As you might 
 expect with a population of 7,500 some
 work in local factories such as       
 Rockware(glass jars)and the rapidly   
 shrinking International Harvesters the
 tractor and farm equipment            
 manufactures.A number of people work  
 in the nearby power stations at Thorpe
 Marsh and Drax. Small business        
 concerns do carry on: Stainforth      
 Fashion Industries and Plumb Waste    
 Paper Collection Services, but the    
 Chicken Factory has closed. New firms 
 such as Multiform,a young peoples     
 cooperative making functional framed  
 furniture,offer hope.                 </content>
