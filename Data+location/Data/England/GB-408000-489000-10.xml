		<title>10MY DAY - REBECCA.</title>
		<content> I get up at 07:45 each day and get    
 washed and dressed.At 08:00 I start to
 watch television for half an hour then
 at 08:30 I go to call for Emma on the 
 way to school. Emma and I arrive at   
 school at about 08:45 where we meet   
 our other friends. At 09:00 a whistle 
 is blown which tells us that it is    
 time for school to begin.             
 Our school day begins with {assembly} 
 which takes place in the dining hall. 
 We usually have a story, sing a hymn  
 and say a prayer. We return to our own
 classroom and have lessons in         
 Mathematics and English until mid-day.
 We have a short break between 10:30   
 and 10:45.                            
 All pupils can stay at school for     
 lunch if they wish. Afternoon lessons 
 begin at 13:05 and continue until     
 15:45.                                
                                       </content>
