		<title>07Noisy Sports in Bletchley</title>
		<content>   The Noisy Sports Area is next to    
 the Milton Keynes Bowl.It is a        
 motorbike track but is also used by   
 B.M.X. bikes.                         
   It is a very bumpy track with       
 ditches that have been specially dug  
 out for the trials bikes.The ditches  
 have vertical drops down the side.    
 There are a lot of big hills which get
 very dangerous when it rains.There are
 trials events where a course is set   
 and the bikes are given faults if they
 make mistakes,they are timed and the  
 fastest time with the least faults    
 wins the trial.                       
   To be safe on a B.M.X. you need a   
 helmet,knee and arm pads,mouth trap(if
 you've got an open face helmet),glove 
 pads and a safe bike or you won't be  
 able to race.
