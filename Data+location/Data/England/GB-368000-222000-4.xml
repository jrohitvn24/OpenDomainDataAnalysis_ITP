		<title>04VILLAGE SCHOOL CLOSURES</title>
		<content> This area once had two thriving little
 Church schools. That at{Cliffords     
{Mesne}was founded in 1860 as a two    
 teacher school with about 40 pupils on
 its roll. It closed about 50 years ago
 and was purchased by the village. It  
 now serves as the Village Hall.       
    The school at{Aston Ingham}was     
 endowed in 1738 but was probably      
 founded several years before this. At 
 one time it provided places for 120   
 children, but these numbers dwindled  
 steadily especially after the setting 
 up of separate secondary education    
 schools. The school eventually closed 
 in 1981 and is at present for sale.   
    Chilldren from Cliffords Mesne now 
 attend schools in Newent whilst those 
 from Aston Ingham go either to Lea or 
 Gorsley at the Infant-Junior stage and
 to Ross-on-Wye at secondary level.
