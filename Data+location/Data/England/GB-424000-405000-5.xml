		<title>05CAT HILL FOOT FARM.</title>
		<content> This farm is to be found in the south 
 west of the study area.               
 All the 63 acres on this farm are     
 rough grazing on which a variety of   
 cows  are kept,Ayrshire, British      
 Friesian, Ayrshire Cross.             
 These cows were used to produce       
 milk.But now they are sold to         
 abattoirs for beef.                   
  Also there were a dozen hens.Which   
 layed around average of 8 eggs a day. 
{MACHINERY}                            
 Machinery consisted of: Muckspreader, 
 Tractors,Tillers.These machines are   
 only a few of which are on the farm.  
 They kept a sheepdog to round up the  
 sheep but now they have no sheep so   
 they keep it as a pet.It is smaller   
 than other farms so it doesn't        
 produce as much as other farms.
