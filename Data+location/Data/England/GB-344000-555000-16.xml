		<title>16PLACENAMES IN WARWICK BRIDGE</title>
		<content> The people round here have a terrible 
 time deciding where they live.        
 The area includes the{parishes}of     
 Wetheral,Hayton and Heads Nook and    
 some people use the{parish}name to say
 where they live.                      
 It is also common to use the name of  
 an area which is not really a {village
 such as Burnrigg or Broadwath.        
 In the village of Warwick Bridge there
 are others called Little Corby,Corby  
 Hill and nearby Warwick on Eden also  
 called Warwick Bank.                  
 If this wasnt enough, people use the  
 name of the{estate}they live on,or    
 even the{road.}These include Hurley   
 Road,Millriggs,Cairn Crescent,Chapel  
 Close,Homesteads,Eden Grange and more.
 So,a person could live in Warwick     
 Bridge or Corby Hill or Burnrigg      
 or Broadwath or Heads Nook and still  
 only have one house.                  </content>
