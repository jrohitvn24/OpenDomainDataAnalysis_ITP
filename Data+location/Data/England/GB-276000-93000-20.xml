		<content> In the past 2 years our headteacher   
 Mr Conridge and his wife have been    
 taking the junior class to Beverly    
 Trust Christian Centre at Chagford. We
 spent a whole week there. In 1984 we  
 went to Kestor Rock and Fernworthy on 
 Dartmoor. In 1985 we went from camp to
 Paignton Zoo, Parke Estate, Haytor    
 Rock and visited the Underground      
 Passages in Exeter as well as the     
 Museum and the Cathedral. We enjoyed  
 swimming at the City Baths. It was    
 better this year because there was no 
 rain. It was fun sleeping at Beverly. 
 It is a large house with lots of rooms
 including a games room, kitchen and   
 large lounge. Each day we went out on 
 a mini-bus. Two student teachers came 
 with us as well as our teacher.
