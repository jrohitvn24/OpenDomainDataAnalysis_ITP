		<content> Our D block is networked with main    
 roads, the busiest being the{Western  
{Avenue.}Commuters to Central London   
 are well served by this and by        
 efficient rail and tube lines. Most   
 jobs in our area are industrial, but  
 many work at{Heathrow Airport}which,  
 though not in our D block is easily   
 accessible.The landscape comprises a  
 mixture of residential and industrial 
 buildings,interspersed with open areas
 of grassland.A prominent feature is   
 the{Grand Union Canal}which winds     
 through our D block.We also have      
 several sights of historical          
 importance,including{St Mary's Church.
{We have a multi-faith}community with a
 mixture of Christian and non-Christian
 religions. Although not perfect for   
 everyone's needs, our D block is a    
 friendly and enjoyable place in which 
 to live and work in{1985. }           </content>
