		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO THE BLOCK</title>
		<content> This block is{mostly countryside}with 
 3 villages:{Hamsey}and{Offham}are     
 small villages with old buildings     
 whilst{Cooksbridge}grew up in the 19th
 and 20th centuries around the{railway 
{station}and{timber yard.}Most of the  
 people in this block live in the two  
 Lewes housing estates,{Malling}and    
{Landport.}The{many farms}concentrate  
 on arable crops but some also graze   
 livestock, especially near the river. 
 Landport was built for the council by 
 German prisoners of war in the 1940's.
 Malling is a mixture of council,      
 police, prison authority and private  
 housing.                              
 The{river Ouse}runs through the block 
 and cuts a valley through the South   
 Downs which surround it. There are    
 many lovely walks and delightful      
 picnic spots.
