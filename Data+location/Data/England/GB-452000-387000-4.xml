		<title>04The Abbey near Laughton</title>
		<content> The most important ancient ruin in our
 area is Roche Abbey. Everyone knows   
 about it and everyone around here has 
 visited it. It is a very old ruin.    
 Cistercian monks started to build it  
 in the year 1147. The abbey took a    
 long time to build because it wasn't  
 finished until some time in the 15th  
 century.                              
    Nowadays all that is left of the   
 buildings are two large walls on the  
 eastern side with arches and windows  
 in. You can tell by its stonework that
 it must have been a beautiful         
 building. All that is left are the two
 walls and lots of low walls which     
 outline other parts.                  
    The abbey would probably still be  
 standing today but in 1538 it was     
 taken over by King Henry VIII. He     
 allowed all the local people to take  
 away stone,wood and lead.It's a shame.</content>
