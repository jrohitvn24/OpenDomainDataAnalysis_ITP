		<title>11A Day In The Life Of Chris.</title>
		<content> At 8:00 a.m.Mum wakes me up.I go down 
 for breakfast and have a sandwich and 
 a cup of tea and at 8:30 a.m.I get    
 dressed.                              
  I wait for Mrs.Hughes who takes me to
 school.School starts at 9:00 a.m.I    
 usually play with Jamie Grundey,      
 Stephen Lloyd,Paul Jones and Sven     
 Wood.Before going into school we play 
 rugby.                                
  On Fridays we  have multiplcation    
 table tests and handwriting.          
  There are two playtimes and one      
 dinnertime.I take sandwiches for my   
 lunch. At 3:30 p.m. school finishes.  
  At 6:00 p.m. we have tea,which is    
 usually potatoes, carrots and meat of 
 some kind.                            
  After tea I practise break dancing   
 because television on Fridays is      
 boring.At 9:00 p.m.I go to bed and    
 read for a while.                     </content>
