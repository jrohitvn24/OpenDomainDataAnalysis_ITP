		<content>   Headfield Middle School provides    
{school meals}every day for{300        
{children.}Compared with other schools 
 the meals at Headfield are very good. 
 Most children{hate}school meals but   
 I'm sure if they came to our school   
 they would{enjoy}them.                
   The meals always contain{protein}and
 are very good for the children's      
{health.}A few children are never      
 satisfied so they throw their food    
 away.  The cooks make{warm}and{cold   
 dinners.  The warm dinners are        
{different}every day, the cold dinners 
 are usually{salads.}The dinners cost  
 Â£2.50 per week or 50pence per day.    
   We line up for dinner outside at 12 
 o clock, and we have one hour and     
 fifteen minutes for lunch.            
   We pay for our dinners in the       
 morning after registration, and at    
 dinnertime it's ready and waiting.    </content>
