		<title>08LAW AND ORDER CRIME POLICE</title>
		<content>There are few serious crimes in this   
area.Burglary and theft are the most   
common crimes,amounting to 30 or 40    
cases a year.Money is most commonly    
stolen and small objects,such as       
jewellery and silver,which cannot be   
traced easily.Although the crime       
figures are consistent throughout the  
year,there is usually an increase      
during the Christmas period,when gangs 
of three to four criminals, often from 
as far afield as London,burgle houses  
in the area.Crimes of violence are     
virtually unknown,although some people 
who have served prison sentences for   
violence live in the area.The constable
who lives in Tunstall police house also
patrols Rodmersham and Highsted.Most   
police time is spent dealing with      
occasional road accidents,especially in
winter when the narrow country roads   
are icy.                               </content>
