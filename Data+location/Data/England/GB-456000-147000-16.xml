		<content> Mrs. Kirby has lived at "Longcroft" in
 Pardown for 31 years and has served as
 a{Governor}of the local primary school
 for 28 years. She has watched the     
 village grow and played an active part
 in creating the present village       
 community. She has served on local    
 councils,runs the{Luncheon Club,}heads
 the management of{East Oakley Village 
{Hall}and plays a major role in the    
 organisation of{Community Care}in the 
 village. She remembers the days when  
 the train stopped by the cricket field
 to allow visiting teams to alight.    
 A parchment document of 1836 describes
 a change of ownership of{"Longcroft"} 
 and its neighbour for Â£38 and states  
 that the four tenements should be used
 as poor houses for people from Wootton
 St. Lawrence. Until recently Mrs.Kirby
 paid a peppercorn rent but this has   
 ceased, being too costly to collect.  </content>
