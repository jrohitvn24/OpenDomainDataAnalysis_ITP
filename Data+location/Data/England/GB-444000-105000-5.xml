		<content> Probably the greatest change in the   
 area in recent years was the          
 demolishion of the{Royal Victoria     
{Hospital}in 1979.Until then the       
 hospital,completed in 1863,had        
 dominated the landscape for 113yrs.   
 It was 468yds long and had a huge     
 chapel at the centre which is topped  
 with a green copper dome.The building 
 was of the Italien style favoured by  
 the Victorians and is repeated at     
{Osborne House}on the Isle of Wight.   
  The{chapel}still stands as a{        
{monument}to a bygone era and has been 
 renovated for public use.             
  The Officers Mess may be turned into 
 flats but it has now become dangerous 
 because of vandalism and has been     
 fenced off.Some of the buildings are  
 still used by the Hampshire Police,   
 the park Warden and for sports use.
