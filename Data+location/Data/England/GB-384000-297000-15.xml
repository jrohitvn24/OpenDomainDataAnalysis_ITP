		<content>On Saturday's I get up at 9.00 and get 
dressed. I then go to the Kitchen to   
get my Breakfast and turn on the       
television. My Dad comes home from work
at 10.30. Between 10.30 and midday I   
usually go and play with a friend.     
After 12.00 we often go shopping in    
Dudley, Wolverhampton or Telford. When 
we are out we sometimes go to          
'McDonalds' for a Beefburger and a cup 
of cofee. We would get home by about   
16.00. The Mum would make us some      
Sausages and Chips. Then I watch       
television. At about 20.30 we have     
a small for example snack;for example; 
Yogart or Sandwich. At 21.00 or 21. 00 
I usually go to bed and read till its  
time to go to sleep.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
