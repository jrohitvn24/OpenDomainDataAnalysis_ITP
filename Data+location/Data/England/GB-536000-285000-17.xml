		<title>17The Museum:Chatteris(1)</title>
		<content>    Housed in an old nineteenth century
 farmbuilding,the museum was officially
 opened on 12 November, 1963 though its
 origins go back to 1942 when Mr       
 Charles Dobbs set up a display in a   
 small glass cabinet in one corner of  
 the Urban Council Chambers. It was    
 once described as"the smallest museum"
 in the country and was the first to be
 seen in this area. With enthusiasm and
 hard work the local exhibits have     
 expanded to fill four rooms.          
    The museum is open on Thursdays    
 between 2pm and 4pm or by special     
 arrangement. Since the museum opened  
 the curator has been Mr Stone, a      
 retired gentleman whose services are  
 completely voluntary. He is assisted  
 by the 'Friends of the Museum' who    
 meet on the third Friday evening of   
 each month. The running costs are paid
 by the parish council.                </content>
