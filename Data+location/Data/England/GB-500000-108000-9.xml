		<title>09FAST FLOWING RIVER ARUN</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
 The Arun is the second fastest river  
 after the Severn. The banks have been 
 re-inforced in many parts to avoid the
 extensive flooding which at times     
 would turn the valley into an inland  
 sea. Two meanders in the river gap    
 make islands accessible by simple     
 bridges  so that cows can graze on the
 rich grass. Weed grows extensively in 
 the water, and rushes line the banks. 
 Coarse fishing in the river is good   
 and many clubs and syndicates rent    
 stretches of the banks. Motor boats   
 speed up and down the main river and  
 larger launches take visitors for     
 trips. Sometimes one may be lucky     
 enough to see a kingfisher. Swans and 
 their cygnets abound as well as       
 moorhens and coots.
