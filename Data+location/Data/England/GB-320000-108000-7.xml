		<title>07Role of farmer's wife.</title>
		<content>   This is no sinecure.His wife may    
 take over all the farmer's paper-     
 work as well as the jobs that are hers
 by tradition:looking after the        
 poultry,for instance.Many a farm      
 announces(enticingly these days)that  
 "free-range eggs"are for sale.Geese   
 and turkeys are bought as chicks (one 
 source is Peterborough) and fattened  
 for Christmas.Honey and clotted cream 
 are also sold at the farm door.       
   At busy times on the farm she will  
 lend a hand.I have seen one humping   
 food out to sheep in the snow,for     
 instance.To be able to drive is       
 imperative,for the children must be   
 chauffeured to school,extra lessons,  
 meetings,dentist,etc. And she will    
 drive anything.Three-thirty may well  
 see Mum at the school-gate,not in a   
 car,but in the tractor!
