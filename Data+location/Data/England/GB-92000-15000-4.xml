		<content>   On this island because of it's      
 remoteness and small population we do 
 not have any resident medical         
 staff.Butthe Doctor from the main     
 island comes every Wednesday to a     
 surgery in an islanders home.Similarly
 the District Nurse comes every other  
 Monday to carry out her work with the 
 elderly and young, and to administer  
 treatment.Of course they cannot come  
 over water in an ambulance so instead 
 they have a medical launch called the 
 Santa Warna.First Aid equipment and a 
 stretcher are kept on the island.If we
 need hospital treatment the Santa     
 Warna takes us to the cottage hospital
 on the main island,St.Marys.          
 Specialists from the mainland regulary
 visit this hospital.Sometimes the     
 Doctor cannot cope with a problem     
 so then he sends you to a mainland    
 hospital for further treatment.       </content>
