		<content> The primary land-cover category is    
 mainly sand and gravel works with alot
 of commercial development.There are   
 quite a few shops on the corner of the
 main road.There is a post office and a
 small cafe which offers a take-away   
 service.There are two green-grocers   
 and also about three newsagents.There 
 is one D.I.Y. store and a Betting shop
 next door to it.Quite nearby there was
 a public playing field with swings and
 a slide.
