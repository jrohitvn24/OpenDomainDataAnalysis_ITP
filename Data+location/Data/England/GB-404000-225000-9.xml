		<content> St Kenelm's Well                      
                                       
 This is a small stone pump house which
 was re-built in 1887.  A water supply 
 was first taken to Winchcombe Abbey in
 lead pipes in the thirteenth century. 
 In 1887 the town of Winchcombe was    
 given a water supply from the Well.   
 St Kenelm was the son of the Saxon    
 king Kenulf.  He was supposedly       
 murdered by his sister Quendryth when 
 seven years old.  His body was brought
 back to Winchcombe and at each        
 stopping place a spring of water      
 miraculously appeared.  During the    
 Middle Ages it was an important place 
 of pilgrimage.  Some of the homes in  
 Winchcombe still have water from this 
 well although now most are connected  
 to the Severn-Trent supply.
