		<title>06The M5 motorway</title>
		<content> The M5 was the third motorway to be   
 opened in England 25 years ago. It    
 only has 2 lanes in each direction and
 is very busy. About 40000 vehicles use
 the motorway each day so now the      
 motorway is being widened. It is      
 causing great difficulties because the
 traffic has to use the hard shoulder  
 as a road. Only 3 houses have had to  
 be demolished. Wherever possible it is
 widened on both sides but near Hanbury
 Road, Droitwich all the widening is to
 be on one side because of a bank of   
 trees and houses. Where the banks are 
 softer the job is easier. In the      
 winter they have to pay Â£3000 a night 
 ot grit the road. Only one engineer   
 has been killed working on the        
 motorway. There are things called sky 
 cradles which they put across the road
 to hold the electricity cables when   
 they are being moved.                 </content>
