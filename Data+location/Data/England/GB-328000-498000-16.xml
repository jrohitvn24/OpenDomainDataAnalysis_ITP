		<content>    The original deciduous{scrub}that  
 covered the fells was removed by man  
 many centuries ago. Fragments of the  
 nearest equivalent now remain as      
{deciduous woodland}on the valley      
 sides ( see{Local History}). The      
 altitude, heavy rainfall, poor soil   
 and topography make{grass}the only    
 viable crop in our area, and so the   
 open fell is covered by upland grasses
 together with{heather}and{bracken,    
 whilst the valleys have enclosed rough
 grazing of better quality. In addition
 the factors mentioned encourage the   
 growing of{conifers,}so that          
 plantations have become increasingly  
 common.                               
    These contrasting forms of         
 vegetation provide suitable habitats  
 for a wide variety of animals, as well
 as giving protection against{soil     
{erosion.                              </content>
