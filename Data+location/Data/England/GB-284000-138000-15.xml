		<content> Every Tuesday I go to Brownies at     
 Timberscombe.Our pack is called the   
 First Timberscombe Pack. On Saturday  
 we are doing a gang show at the West  
 Somerset school, to celebrate 75 years
 of Guiding. Our theme is the English  
 weather. In June we had "It's a       
 knockout" at Horner. At Brownies we   
 play a selection of games like "Isn't 
 it funny how bears like honey?",      
 "Noah's ark","Fishes" and "Baked      
 Beans".Every year we go on pack       
 holiday. This year I'm going to camp  
 at Dulverton Middle School. I hope    
 that I get a lot of badges this year. 
 I have already got 6 . I hope alot    
 more girls join Brownies. It is very  
 enjoyable.
