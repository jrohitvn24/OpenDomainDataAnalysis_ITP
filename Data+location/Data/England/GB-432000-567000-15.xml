		<content> Although for many years crime has     
 increased nationally at a rate of     
 6%,the average person usually imapines
 the burglaries and other crimes will  
 not affect them.The majority of       
 victims of crime,however,have never   
 been victims before,and unless you    
 take the elementry precautions to     
 remove temptation and make things     
 difficult for the criminal,it is      
 probable that you too will become a   
 victum because there is so many break 
 ins the 1980's.Pensioners are at risk 
 the most.In North Shields a pensioner 
 was attacked in her own home just     
 because she wouldn't give 36p to some 
 children for some chips.Other people  
 at risk are Housewives,Businessmen,   
 Firms and Children.
