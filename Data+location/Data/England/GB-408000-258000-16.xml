		<content>      In the last few years there has  
 been a lot of building in the nothern 
 part of Alcester, providing all kinds 
 of homes for all sorts of people.     
      There are houses with plenty of  
 space built for families, and others  
 built for people living alone. Some of
 these are called "pads" and are very  
 small with a kitchen/livingroom and a 
 bedroom. Mostly young people live in  
 these. There are also houses for      
 people who are only just married or   
 have only one child. These are cheaper
 to buy than bigger detached houses    
 which take more land. Two-storey      
 flats, bungalows and maisonettes with 
 garages underneath the living area    
 have been built. The flats are not    
 suitable for elderly people, but the  
 bungalows would be. Some houses are   
 privately owned and  others are rented
 from the council.                     </content>
