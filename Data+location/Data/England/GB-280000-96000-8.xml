		<content> cows,there were eight of them  and    
 the next day they were going to       
 market.They had an earring to keep the
 flies away.Off we walked to see a lamb
 and a billy goat.The lamb had a       
 disease called orf(sores around his   
 mouth).There were also these old barns
 that once were part of the Shelley    
 estate.We went as close to the billy  
 goat as we dared.He was a very        
 ferocious and he had hose pipe on his 
 horns just so he can't buck and hurt  
 you.We went back to the farm to get   
 our bags and things.Off we walked to  
 Demmits farm.We came through the farm 
 and looked at the barns one was to    
 keep cows and bulloks and it could fit
 36 in.There were little places where  
 they put their heads through to       
 feed.In the winter they stay in the   
 barn.Mr Pope has to keep food for     
 them,so they cut grass in the summer  </content>
