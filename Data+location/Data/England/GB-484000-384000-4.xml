		<title>04Working on a farm in Upton.</title>
		<content> I live in a village called Upton.When 
 i am not at{school }I work on a farm  
 in the village.I mostly work on the   
 tractors and I do most of the grass   
 cutting in June and July.             
 I cut grass for{silage}and three weeks
 later I do a second cut for hay.Silage
 is made by tipping all the grass into 
 a large pit and covering it over until
 the winter.When it is covered it      
 sweats and makes it juicy for the cows
 to eat.When making the silage I pull  
 trailers behind the tractor;a Ford    
 7600,for a whole week.                
 In{hay making}time I pull the the     
 bailer which makes the bails.At{      
{harvest time}I drive at the side of   
 the combine harvester collecting the  
 grain in a trailer.I also do all the  
 muck spreading and all the hedge      
 cutting.                              
                                       </content>
