		<title>02THE PHOENIX OF FLEETWOOD</title>
		<content>    In the initial gloom of the post-  
 cod-war era, Fleetwood suffered as    
 does a mining village whose mines are 
 closed. Fishermen no longer fished,   
 and families once separated by sea but
 joined in prosperity were now united  
 in despair. Then the phenomenon of the
 container port appeared, and with that
 a chance for new work for Fleetwood   
 and fresh hope for its people. Apart  
 from the shipowners, the I.C.I. had   
 been the key employers of the         
 townspeople. Soon Pandoro was to be an
 employer and the Buffalo container    
 ship welcome in place of the fishing  
 fleet. Now, in 1985, Fleetwood is     
 showing signs of new confidence and   
 new growth. Thanks to Fleetwood's     
 namesake and originator, it has always
 been blessed with fine, wide streets, 
 and recent developments are restoring 
 its civic pride as a sea-side resort. </content>
