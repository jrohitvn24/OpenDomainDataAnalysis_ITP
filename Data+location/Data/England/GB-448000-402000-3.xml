    The Saxon Cross, now preserved in  
 the Church, was found in the          
 Churchyard. It probably pre-dates the 
 earliest church, and would certainly  
 have been erected in a prominent      
 position in the Village, and was the  
 place where the travelling friars held
 services and preached the Christian   
 faith.                                
    The first church in Barnburgh was  
 built about 1150 A.D.It was quite     
 small, and alterations were made in   
 1330 A.D.and 1410 A.D.which enlarged  
 the Church to its present size.       
    The church is the centre of the    
 life of the village.Even the earlist  
 church had a porch, and it was here   
 that the Village Elders met to decide 
 matters both religious and secular,   
 affecting the Community.              </content>
