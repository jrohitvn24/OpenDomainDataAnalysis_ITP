The M54 was built especially to link   
Telford to the country's national      
motorway network.                      
It has helped people who work in       
Birmingham and Telford because now you 
can get to Birmingham within half an   
hour, London within two and half hours 
and Telford within twenty minutes      
drive.The faster and easier travel has 
turned Telford into a very busy place. 
Because of the easy access to Telford, 
new businesses have set up and now the 
government is making a profit.         
The motorway cost 65M pounds to build  
because there are a lot of banks that  
the motorway is set on and a lot of    
bridges like the one between Brewood   
and Codsall.The M54 / M6 link-up opened
on the 25th November 1983.
