only club is for girls and that is the 
Brownies. In the Brownies there are 11 
girls and four helpers.

For other activities children have to  
travel to Longtown or Carlisle. some   
boys go to Cubs and Judo.              
Some children have their own computers 
which they use for recreation. There is
also a Riding School in the area where 
children can learn to ride, many       
children from outside this area travel 
here in order to learn to ride.
