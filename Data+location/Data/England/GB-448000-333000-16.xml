		<title>16CHILWELL. Area History.</title>
		<content> We believe that the first settlement  
 at Chilwell was after the Romans left 
 Britain although we think that the    
 Romans settled at nearby Stapleford   
 and used the Chilwell area for        
 farming.                              
  The first real settlers to build a   
 small settlement were Anglo Saxons who
 invaded Britain after 700 AD and may  
 have come to this area by 750 AD. It  
 is more than likely that an Anglo     
 Saxon gave his name to this           
 settlement. Old English Wel- Clear    
 Water, Chiefs name Chil.              
  Chilwell is mentioned in the {       
{Domesday Book} as being part of       
 Beeston.
