		<content> At the heart of every English village 
 there is always a church. There       
 existed a wooden Saxon church at      
 Tempsford until 1010 when it was      
 destroyed by the Danes. In 1129 a     
 small stone built Norman church was   
 constructed.                          
 The present day building was built in 
 the late 14thC. The naves &amp; arcades   
 were repaired in oolite in the 17thC  
 and still bear the original masons    
 marks.The font the east windows and   
 the rood screen stairs still remain   
 from the 14thC work. Inside the church
 is a large oak chest (8") carved from 
 a single tree which used to contain   
 the parish records.                   
 In 1874 during restoration work to the
 church the chest was removed to a     
 local barn where it suffered bad flood
 damage and many records were          
 destroyed.                            </content>
