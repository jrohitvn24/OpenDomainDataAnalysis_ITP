		<title>11Legionnaire's Disease</title>
		<content>   On April 9th 1985, a patient at the 
 Renal Unit of St Mary's Hospital, died
 from{Legionella Pneumophila.}It can be
 spread by infected water droplets. The
 hospital took precautionary measures, 
 closing 7 wards and 3 operating       
 theatres.{Kidney patients,}being 10 to
 100 times more{at risk}because of     
 their drugs, were the main worry. One 
 kidney ward was cleared of patients. A
 shower head was thought to contain the
 deadly bacteria.                      
   Not long after the hospital was     
 given a clean bill of health, a 22    
 year old man become seriously ill. He 
 developed all the{symptoms}of         
 legionella -aches and pains, shortage 
 of breath, a high temperature,        
 shivering coughs and pneumonia- but   
 lived.
