 The area is essentially a farming     
 region concentrating on {Dairy Cattle;
{Pasture; Arable crops and market      
{gardening.}There are 5 farms and 3 of 
 these have farm shops.                
 The whole region is in the London     
 Green Belt and Letchmore Heath,       
 Batlers' Green, Round Bush and        
 Aldenham Village are all in a         
 Conservation area with strict rules   
 governing any developments.  Expansion
 of any built up area is unlikely and  
 unwanted; only infilling will be      
 accepted.  The Motorway created a     
 noisy distraction in an otherwise     
 quiet rural setting, to the west; but 
 the community has learned to live with
 it, even though the original 4 lanes  
 have been changed to 6 thus reducing  
 still further the green pastures.     </content>
