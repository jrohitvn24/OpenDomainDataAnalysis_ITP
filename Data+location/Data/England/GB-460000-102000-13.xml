		<title>13BLAKE MATERNITY HOME</title>
		<content> This maternity home provides          
 facilities for all maternity patients 
 in Gosport.  It is staffed by a       
 Nursing Officer, four sisters, five   
 midwives and eleven auxiliary nurses. 
 It has facilities for three patients  
 in labour and fifteen post natal      
 patients.  In addition to the         
 permanent staff there are twelve      
 community midwives attached to local  
 General Practitioners who use the     
 hospital facilities to deliver their  
 own patients.  The majority of        
 patients spend seven days in the home.
 Approximately 220 babies are delivered
 each year, in addition to those       
 delivered in St Mary's Hospital in    
 Portsmouth.  Mothers and babies       
 delivered generally return to Blake   
 for a recovery period.  The outpatient
 clinics deal with about 1100 patients 
 annually.                             </content>
