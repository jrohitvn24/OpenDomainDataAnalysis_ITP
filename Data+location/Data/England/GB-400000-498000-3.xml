		<content> The first thing my dad does is milk   
 he milks three cows the milk goes to  
 our family not to the milk tanker.    
 Then he starts the main thing for the 
 time of                               
 year.If it is lambing time he will go 
 and see the twin lambs first we keep  
 the twins inside. Then he goes and    
 sees the single lambs. Lambs get all  
 different sorts of diseases like      
 pneumonia or rattlebelly and pintail. 
 If it is haytime he will start to mow 
 and kruger and row.If it is silage the
 rowerputs the silage into rows and    
 then it is bailed. then the beef      
 cattle eat the hay and silage in      
 winter. When they are fat enough they 
 are sold.                             
        Our farm is on Whita-Side but  
 my dad has some land further away     
 outside the grid area.
