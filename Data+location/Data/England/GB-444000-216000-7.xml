		<title>07MEMORIES OF WOODSTOCK</title>
		<content>  Mrs Clothier has lived in Woodstock  
all her life. She went to Woodstock    
Primary School when boys and girls were
taught in separate classes. The        
teachers were very strict. She left    
school at 14 and worked as a dairy maid
at Blenheim during World War 1.        
  After the war she worked as a        
secretary in her grandfater's glove    
factory. She enjoyed working there     
very much. There were about fifty      
employees. The length of time it took  
to make a pair of gloves, varied. The  
Clothiers made gloves for sportsmen.   
The men cut the gloves from a pattern  
whilst ladies sewed them together on   
machines. The leather was stiff to cut.
Many gloves were cut out at the factory
and sewed together by out-workers in   
their homes in the villages. Mrs       
Clothier said one person could make two
or three pairs of gloves a week.       </content>
