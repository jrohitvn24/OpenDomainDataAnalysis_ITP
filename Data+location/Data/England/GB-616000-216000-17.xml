		<title>17The Cemetery, Gt. Clacton</title>
		<content>     Since Clacton is such a young     
 resort (only about a hundred years)   
 the land was quickly bought up and    
 developed. This meant that there were 
 only two established churches in the  
 area,{St John's}and{St James'.        
 Obviously there were many more needed 
 as the town grew in size, but they    
 could only buy a small plot of land on
 which to build. A communal cemetary   
 was the only solution since the church
 possessed very little land.           
     The cemetary was opened in 1899   
 and covered about 50,000 sq.metres.   
 In recent years more land has been    
 acquired to make an annexe of         
 20,000 sq. metres across the road.    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
