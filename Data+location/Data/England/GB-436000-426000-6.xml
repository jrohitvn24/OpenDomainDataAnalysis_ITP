		<title>06Woodlesford Station</title>
		<content> Local councillors and residents are   
 fighting the proposed closure of      
 Woodlesford Station.It was announced  
 in February that the station on the   
 Leeds/Wakefield line was to be        
 closed.Closing stations at Woodlesford
 and Oulton would save British Rail    
 about Â£900,000 a year.The decision has
 been opposed by the local rail uses   
 who are angry at the threat to the    
 station.Petitions have been           
 organized,and letters written to those
 involved in the decision.Councillor   
 Hudson says,"The decision has been    
 taken without the Passenger transport 
 executive listerning to the views of  
 local people.The Labour Party have    
 asked local M.P.Bill O'Brien to help  
 over the proposed closure of the      
 station.They took the decision purely 
 on financial grounds but this is not  
 just a financial matter.              </content>
