		<content>{TRANSPORT}IN SANDBACH WILL HAVE TAKEN 
 ON A NEW LOOK BY THE END OF NEXT YEAR.
 IN THE SPRING OF 1985 WORK BEGAN ON A 
 NEW ROAD TO{BY-PASS}SANDBACH CENTRE   
 FOR ALL TRAFFIC TRAVELLING TO AND FROM
 THE M6{MOTORWAY.}THE ROAD PASSES      
 BEHIND THE CONGLETON ROAD ESTATE,     
 TOUCHING THE DINGLE AND THE PALMER    
 ROAD ESTATE BEFORE JOINING CREWE ROAD 
 100 YARDS FROM THE TOWN CENTRE.THE    
 CENTRE IS SMALL AND IS ON THE MAIN    
 ROAD LINKING SUCH TOWNS AS CREWE AND  
 MIDDLEWICH TO THE M6.THE ROADS ARE    
 NARROW AND THERE IS A COMPLEX SYSTEM  
 OF TRAFFIC LIGHTS,ROUNDABOUTS AND     
 ISLANDS.{CONGESTION}BUILDS UP EASILY  
 ESPECIALLY WHEN THE WEATHER IS BAD.IN 
 HIGH TOWN THE HEAVY LORRIES OFTEN HAVE
 TO MOUNT THE PAVEMENT WHICH CAUSES    
 DAMAGE TO THE ROAD SURFACE,THE        
 KERB,THE BUILDINGS AND DANGER TO THE  
 PEDESTRIANS.                          </content>
