 His father started the business in    
{1913}hauling cement from{Mitcheldean. 
 At one time  he had 87 lorries this   
 has now been reduced to 25. They now  
 employ 28 drivers and 14 fitters with 
 an outside repair business started in 
 1970. They have an agency for E.R.F.  
 trucks. During the{miners strike}they 
 were employed to take coal from the   
 mines, they had up to 10 lorries on   
 this job. They had a lot of trouble   
 with the striking miners with broken  
 windows and attacks on lorries. He    
 took the miners union to court for    
 this and was awarded{Â£50,000 damages. 
 They have delivered animal feed to the
 Middle East,Baghdad and Pakistan. Now 
 they sometimes deliver goods to
