		<content> or Goal Attack or Goal Defence. The   
 Goal Keeper stops the ball and the    
 Shooter tries to get goals in.        
                                       
 ROUNDERS In the game rounders there   
 are four posts and there are people by
 them and the bowler throws the ball at
 the batsman. There are at least ten in
 the bats team. The batsman hits the   
 ball and if the other team catches the
 ball you are out. You have to run     
 round the post and stop on a post if  
 the other team have got the ball. If  
 you get round all the posts you have  
 got a rounder.                        
                                       
 FOOTBALL is usually played by boys so 
 I do not know much about it but I know
 that you kick the ball into the other 
 team's goal.
