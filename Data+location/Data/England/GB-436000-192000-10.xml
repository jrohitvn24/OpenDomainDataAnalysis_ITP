		<title>10Village church and chapel</title>
		<content>In 1979, the parish church of St.Peters
Charney Bassett, joined with the church
of St. Mary the Virgin, Lyford,        
(together with Longworth and Hinton    
Waldrist), to form the new parish of   
Cherbury.  At Charney Bassett it is    
only possible to hold one service each 
Sunday, so Holy Communion and Evensong 
are alternated. The services of a      
priest have to be shared with other    
churches. There is a small Sunday      
School with around 10 members. In l985 
work started on repairing the roof.    
The cost is estimated at 40,000        
pounds, most of which has been raised  
with help from the English Heritage    
Trust.  The little chapel at Lyford was
almost wholly built during the first   
half of the 13th century, and is       
nowadays still used regularly.
