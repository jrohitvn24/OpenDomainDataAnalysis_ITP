		<title>02LOCAL POLITICS, MRS THATCHER</title>
		<content> Though Mrs Margaret Thatcher the      
 current and the first woman British   
 Prime Minister was born and brought up
 in Grantham she did not live in this  
 NE area. Her school, Kestevan and     
 Grantham Girls School, which is still 
 a single sex girls grammar school,    
 lies just on the edge of our survey   
 area. The present local MP is the     
 Conservative member Mr Douglas Hogg   
 who actually lives further north      
 closer to Lincoln. The area is        
 generally regarded as safe Tory. In   
 the local ward elections however      
 certain districts around Grantham are 
 more likely to vote Labour or even the
 new SDP persuasion.A recent vacancy   
 has arisen in the local Harrowby ward 
 due to the death of the local         
 councillor. The forth coming          
 bi-election will test the popularity  
 of the current Conservative Government</content>
