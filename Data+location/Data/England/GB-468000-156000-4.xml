		<content> There is a park in Rotherwick, which  
 includes a cricket pitch, a football  
 pitch and a tennis court.The tennis   
 court can be hired for Â£15 for a years
 play.The cricket pitch is used nearly 
 every weekend by Rotherwick Cricket   
 Club. They play in a league, and have 
 to travel all over Hampshire. The     
 pavilion they use is about 50 years   
 old. It is made mainly of wood but    
 there is some brick around the base,  
 and the roof is thatched. A groundsman
 looks after the pitch. In the winter  
 the pitch is used for football, the   
 goals and nets are put up each weekend
 ready for friendly matches between    
 villages.                             
 Most boys like to play football in    
 their spare time and the girls like to
 go horse riding.
