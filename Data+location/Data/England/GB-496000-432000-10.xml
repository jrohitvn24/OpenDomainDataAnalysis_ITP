		<content>  Most households in the village have a
 car. Only 2 out of our sample of 32   
 did not have their own motor vehicle. 
  However a lot of people rely on the  
 bus where there is only 1 car in the  
 family but 2 or more people needing to
 travel, so everyone in our survey was 
 against cutting public transport even 
 if they did not use it themselves.    
  The Hull to Barnsley railway passed  
 through our sector, and there is still
 the long tunnel which had to be cut   
 through the chalk hills by navvies.   
 The line was uneconomic and closed in 
 1956.
