		<title>09RANSKILL GUIDES</title>
		<content>  In Ranskill there is a building      
 called "The Church Room".We have      
 guides there every Tuesday            
 evening.Guides starts at six o'clock  
 and ends at eight o'clock.We all split
 up into groups,these are called       
 patrols.I am in the patrol "Forget Me 
 Not".The other patrols are Blue Bell, 
 White Heather and Red Rose.We do all  
 sorts of things including,quizes and  
 treasure hunts.It costs 20p for subs  
 which pays for trips that we go on    
 (like hiking and other                
 activities.)This week we are making   
 models out of soap.We do badges like  
 collectors,we have to collect         
 something, then put them on           
 display.Guides is run by two          
 ladies,but one of them is leaving     
 soon.
