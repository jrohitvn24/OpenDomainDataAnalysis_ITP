		<title>06FRANK PRICE LOCK</title>
		<content> The{Frank Price Lock}was re_opened in 
 1983. It is 72 metres long, 7 metres  
 wide and 8 metres deep. The lock is   
 operated by a{computer}in the{control 
{tower.}To open the lock gates there is
 a button which also operates the      
{hydraulic sluice gates.}To make the   
 water level with the river you open   
 the sluice gates, which let water in  
 from the{canal.}When the water is     
 level the lock gates are open and the 
 barge can go in. In case of a power   
 cut the lockeeper, Mr Lidster, has a  
 generator which will make electricity 
 to operate the lock. The lock has     
{traffic lights}on each side to tell   
 the bargee when to sail into the lock.
 The lock gates have to be{'v' shaped.}
 If they are not the water would break 
 through with all the{pressure.}The    
 lock can take a{700 tonne barge. }
