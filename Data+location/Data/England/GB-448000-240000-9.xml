*** TUESDAY 18th JUNE *** When in our  
square/ Which was called D, It started 
to rain/ And got windy.                
We all put cagoules on/ To shelter     
from the rain,/ And when the rain had  
gone, Took them off again.             
Lots of work,/ Was done that day, We   
all had answers to find,/ And no time  
to play.                               
We interviewed people,/ From different 
places,/ Asked them questions,/ and    
saw many new faces.

*** ON THE 18th OF JUNE *** On the     
18th of June we walked to our square.  
We had lots of fun everywhere./We      
wrote our information down in a book.  
But after that we still had to look.   
We had to make notes on where we had   
been./We had to make sketches of what  
we had seen.                           </content>
