		<title>05The Undercliff</title>
		<content> The chief natural feature in this area
 is the'Undercliff'.The total length is
 about six miles from Bonchurch through
 to Niton and in width varies from a   
 quarter to a half a mile.In this area,
 on the land side it is bounded by     
 cliff sometimes two hundred feet in   
 height and to the sea a secondary     
 cliff which in places gives way to    
 rough broken ground sloping rapidly   
 down to the shore. There are bands of 
{Gault}along the area and the presence 
 of this clay,known locally as"Blue    
 Slipper",is the main cause of the     
 great landslips that have formed the  
 undercliff.The action too of the      
 sea,wind,rain and frost and numerous  
 springs which occur amongst the rock  
 mean that the coastline has been      
 rapidly eroded.Many properties have   
 been affected by subsidence and some  
 quite seriously in this area recently.</content>
