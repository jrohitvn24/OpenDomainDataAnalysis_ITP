		<content> Carlton has grown considerably since  
 the first World War when it was just a
 few scattered cottages.People moved to
 Carlton mainly because of jobs at the 
 power stations of Drax,Ferrybridge and
 Eggborough.Before the power stations  
 were built Carlton was just a small   
 farming village,with most of the land 
 owned by the ancestors of the Duke of 
 Norfolk. Today there are only a few of
 the old houses left. Some have been   
 pulled down to build new houses for   
 people that move here to work. There  
 are a lot of new bungalows,detached   
 houses and semi-detached houses.      
 A permanent site for twelve gypsy     
 families has been built on the edge of
 the village providing hard standings  
 and other modern facilities.Built 1984
 it has encouraged them to integrate.
