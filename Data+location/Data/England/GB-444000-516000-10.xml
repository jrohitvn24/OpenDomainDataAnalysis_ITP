		<title>10LIFE STYLES-Hair Fashions</title>
		<content> Teenagers have many different hair    
 styles. Some shave their heads and    
 they are called skinheads. Others wear
 their hair very long, and some boys   
 have longer hair than girls. Boys     
 often get their hair permed. Some boys
 and girls make their hair spikey so   
 that it just stands up on their heads.
 They use cream or lacquer to keep it  
 in place.                             
    Hair is frequently dyed and many   
 colours are used e.g. green, red,     
 blue, black, purple. Sometimes part of
 the hair is dyed one colour and the   
 other part is dyed a different colour.
 One of the strangest hairstyles is to 
 shave the head, except for a narrow   
 band of hair stretching from the back 
 of the neck to the forehead. This is  
 grown long, and greased so that it    
 stands up like a large comb.
