		<content>  The landscape is flat with no hills. 
 It is cultivated farmland enclosed by 
 hedges. There is no dry-stone         
 walling.The hedges are mainly         
 hawthorne and blackthorne with some   
 elder and a few trees - generally ash-
 scattered along the line of the       
 hedge.                                
  Willows grow alongside the wet       
 meadows adjacent to the{River Thames  
 and also where the{Thames and Severn  
{canal}used to traverse the area. Small
 clumps of such trees identifying where
 farmers have not infilled the canal.  
 The fields tend to be large, staight  
 sided, where hedges and fences have   
 been removed to create larger, simpler
 cereal growing units.
