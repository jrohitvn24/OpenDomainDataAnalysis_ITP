		<content>      As the area has good links with  
 London by both car and train, a{survey
 was carried out at{two local schools  
 to see what proportion of children had
{parents}who were{commuters.           
                                       
      At{Micklefield School}and{Wray   
{Common Middle School}a total of 378   
 children were interviewed.  235 of    
 these had fathers who commuted to     
 work, and 46 had mothers who commuted.
                                       
      From 235 fathers, 134 travelled  
 by car, 82 by train, 6 by van, 6 by   
 motor-bike and 3 by lorry.            
                                       
      Out of the 46 mothers who        
 commuted a total of 40 went by car, 5 
 travelled on the train and one went by
 motor-bike.
