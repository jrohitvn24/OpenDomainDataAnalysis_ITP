		<content> Our area has a great variety of people
 in it.Lots of local characters,like   
 one of our school favourites,Mrs Purdy
 ,who is 82 and comes in to school     
 regularly to talk to us especially    
 about Brinsley in the past.Another    
 favourite is P.C Lomax who is our     
 local policeman.We all know him well  
 and like him a lot.Many of the local  
 people have worked in the mines in the
 past but these are know closing down  
 and the people will either retire,find
 alternative employment or sadly join  
 our ever-growing dole queue.There are 
 a number of self employed             
 people.Brinsley enjoys a good         
 community spirit with many of our mums
 and dads organising local clubs and   
 events.The local primary school(our   
 school) has lots of links with the    
 communities,the church,the older      
 people and with life in general...    </content>
