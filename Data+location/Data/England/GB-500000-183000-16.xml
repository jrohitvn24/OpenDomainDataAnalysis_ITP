		<title>16SCHOOL FOR MALADJUSTED BOYS</title>
		<content> Dromenagh house was built in 1910 for 
 Sir Henry York and his wife Lady      
 Lillian. The original house was burnt 
 down and rebuilt in 1920. In 1948 the 
 house was made into a school.There are
 now thirty-eight boys at the school   
 and they go home to their parents     
 every fortnight.There are four rooms  
 called Windsor, Dover,Pembroke and    
 Arundale, all named after castles.    
 The boys range from six to eleven and 
 if the teachers think they could do   
 with another year they stay on until  
 they are twelve.Some teachers live in 
 the school and some in flats nearby.  
 The school has an outdoor swimming    
 pool and a plastic dome to go over the
 top so that the boys can go swimming  
 in the winter as well as the summer.  
 Dromenagh used to cover four hundred  
 acres but now it only covers          
 seventeen.   By Kirsten Wigley        </content>
