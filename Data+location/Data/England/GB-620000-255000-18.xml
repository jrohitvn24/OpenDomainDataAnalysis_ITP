The Post Office had a small telephone  
kiosk inside which was a glass booth   
with a stool.  To contact the exchange 
it was necessary to crank a handle on  
the side of the phone.  Across the road
there was firstly a wheelwrights and   
then a carpenters.  Most of the timber 
came from locally cut trees.  At the   
correct time a mobile steam engine     
would come and saw the timber into     
planks.                                
Quite clearly the demise of these      
businesses began with the changes in   
farming  and the increase in           
mechanisation .  As more and more      
businesses closed then the whole       
character and pattern of the village   
changed.  Nowadays there are few       
service industries left.  Most people  
will travel to Ipswich or Woodbridge   
for their weekly needs.                </content>
