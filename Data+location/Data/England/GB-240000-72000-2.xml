		<content> The following remarks were made by    
 people in Chilsworthy and Latchley:   
 "Little  attention is  paid to the    
 requirements of the{youth}in the area.
 They need more activities to take up  
 their spare time especially as        
 employment is hard to find at this    
 time. A{village hall}is needed for the
 Women's Institute, clubs and other    
 local activities.                     
 The villages need{public toilet       
{facilities.}There is only one bus to  
 Tavistock each week and some people do
 not have a car.The{road surfaces}could
 also be improved.  Many people are    
 annoyed about the low flying{R.A.F.   
{aircraft}from{stations}in the{South   
{West}practising manoeuvres. The       
 natives, on the whole, do not agree   
 with the{new style of houses}being    
 built. They spoil the rural scene and 
 bring more outsiders in."             </content>
