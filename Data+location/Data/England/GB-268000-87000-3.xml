		<content> Chagford has no universities,         
 technical colleges, polytechnics or   
 Secondary School.  There is, however, 
 a Primary School.  This Primary School
 was originally a Secondary School but 
 changed to a Primary one in 1971.  At 
 that time three local Primary Schools 
 closed, namely those at{Throwleigh,   
{Drewsteignton and Chagford.}There are 
 presently 140 pupils on roll, in 5    
 classes with 5 teachers plus the Head 
 Teacher.                              
 School begins at 0915 and ends at 1545
 with the lunch break lasting from 1215
 until 1325.  Children enter the school
 at 5 years of age and leave at 11+, to
 go in most cases to Okehampton        
 College. On the school site there is  
 also a{Playgroup}to which children of 
 3 to 5 years go and then enter        
 Chagford C/E Primary School. The      
 school has a wide curriculum content. </content>
