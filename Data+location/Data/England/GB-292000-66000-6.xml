		<content>     Most of the old people are fit    
 because they go for long walks and go 
 down to the beach.There is no doctor  
 in the area so they have to telephone 
 or visit him by car.If there is an    
 accident they again rely on the       
 telephone to get an ambulance.        
 Maidencombe has mostly elderly people 
 and they are generally well cared for.
 Some of them have meals on wheels and 
 a community nurse often calls round.  
 However,some people can afford to pay 
 someone to come to cook their meals or
 clean for them.There is a health      
 centre in St. Marychurch which serves 
 the area.
