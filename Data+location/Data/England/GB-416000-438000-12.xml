		<title>12Living in Esholt</title>
		<content> Most of the people we talked to were  
 elderly,perhaps because we went during
 the day,but the impression we formed  
 was that Esholt tends to be a place   
 where elderly people live. A lot of   
 them seem more interested in the past 
 than in the present. When we asked    
 them why they lived in Esholt,most    
 people said they liked the peace and  
 tranquility,and they liked being      
 surrounded by farms and countryside.  
 They especially like the beautiful    
 scenery,even though this brings the   
 tourists,and the tourists do bring    
 problems.On Wednesdays and Sundays the
 village is packed with them,and they  
 do leave a lot of litter behind.      
 Perhaps Esholt people have the best of
 all worlds. They live in beautiful    
 surroundings, but they are close to   
 two major cities.The price they have  
 to pay are the tourists and the smell </content>
