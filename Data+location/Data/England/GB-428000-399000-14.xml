		<title>14Wortley Hall</title>
		<content> Wortley Hall was the home of the      
 Wortley family. The present building  
 dates back to 1757 but there has been 
 a hall on the same site since 1580. It
 is a beautiful building set in the    
 middle of parkland. The main entrance 
 is in the village. In 1950 the family 
 left the hall and moved to another    
 house on the estate. Now the hall is a
 place where people stay for holidays. 
 They are usually retired miners and   
 their families from Durham. They enjoy
 the countryside. The hall is also used
 for conferences and by the villagers  
 for parties. Part of the parkland is  
 used as a golf course. It is a very   
 popular place and several famous      
 people have played there. The         
 gamekeeper lives in the wood nearby.  
 He rears partridges and pheasants. A  
 TV film was made about his work.
