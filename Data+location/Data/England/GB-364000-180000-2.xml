		<title>02Recreation in Winterbourne</title>
		<content>      Some people, mostly boys, like   
 fishing. We have a large duck pond in 
 Winterbourne in which you can catch   
 Carp. Fish up to 5lbs. in weight have 
 been caught here. There is a stable   
 across the road from the pond where   
 you can have riding lessons from the  
 people who own the horses. In the     
 village there is a play area outside  
 the Ridings High School. We call this 
 the rec, which is short for recreation
 field. There is a football pitch,     
 cricket pitch and a tennis court.     
 Close by there is a swimming pool     
 which belongs to the Ridings High     
 School but it is open to the public.  
 In the pubs you can play a number of  
 games like darts, cribbage and        
 skittles.
