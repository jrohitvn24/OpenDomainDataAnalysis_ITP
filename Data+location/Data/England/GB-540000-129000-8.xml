		<title>08FARMING, COMM. CHELWOOD GATE</title>
		<content> As most of the farmland, not wooded,  
 is enclosed pasture, this is given    
 over mainly to sheep and horses, some 
 hay and a few cattle. There is a rare 
 breeds farm and a fruit farm at Wych  
 Cross and at least one pig farm. Most 
 of the horses are children's ponies,  
 hacks and hunters. There is one Garden
 Centre supplying retailers only.      
                                       
{COMMUNICATIONS - CHELWOOD GATE        
 The area has a small telephone ex-

 and there are a few public telephone  
 kiosks. There is one Post Office, two 
 deliveries &amp; collectionf of mail      
 Monday to Friday, one on Saturday and 
 none on Sunday.
