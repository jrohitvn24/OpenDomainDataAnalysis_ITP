		<content> Apart from farms and the river, this  
 area consists mainly of{chalk hillside
 and{deciduous woodland.}Many of the   
 trees have been planted, some to lead 
 as avenues to the estates. Such trees 
 are Lime, Beech and Horse-Chestnut.   
 Much of the woodland was{coppiced}    
 in the past and here are Hazel, Ash,  
 Oak and a variety of shrubs such as   
 Dog Rose. Bluebells carpet some of the
 woods in Spring. The larger mammals   
 like badgers and foxes take cover in  
 the woods, but emerge to feed or to   
 hunt in the fields, where rabbits and 
 hares can also be seen. Small mammals 
 provide abundant food for birds of    
 prey such as the Kestrel, Buzzard and 
 Sparrowhawk. The summer flowers on the
 hills are many and varied. They       
 include bedstraws, Pyramidal Orchid,  
 poppies, knapweeds, Scabious, Cowslip 
 and Yellow Toadflax.                  </content>
