		<title>16Old Buildings in Street</title>
		<content> The oldest building in{Street}is the  
 parish church of{Holy Trinity.}Parts  
 of it date from the thirteenth century
 and it is believed that a Celtic      
 church dedicated to {St. Theda }may   
 have been built in Street in the first
 century A.D. Roman remains have been  
 found in the churchyard.              
   {The Grange,}parts of which were    
 built in the sixteenth century was    
 once known as the Manor of Street. It 
 was at one time owned by William      
 Strode of Barrington Court. The Barn  
 next to the Grange was built in the   
 fourteenth century by the Abbot of    
 Glastonbury.                          
   {The Toll House}which stands in     
 Glaston Rd., near the new bypass is   
 probably 250 years old.               
   {The Friends Meeting House}was built
 in 1850 to replace a smaller building.
 Its burial ground was bought in 1658. </content>
