		<title>07 Alford's Coaches, Coleford</title>
		<content> On Friday 7th June we went to{Alford's
{Coaches.}When we got there the man was
 on the phone so we had to wait for    
 him.  When he came out we went under a
 coach. Under the coach there was a big
 pit to go in and see the underneath of
 the coach. After that we asked the man
 some questions . The number of their  
 oldest coach on the road is BWD 953J. 
 A new coach costs about{Â£43,000. }Each
 driver is allowed to drive for four   
 and  a half hours without a break and 
 then they have to have a half hour    
 break.    The drivers take six schools
 every day .  One of the  girls asked, 
  " What is your most embarrassing     
 moment?"   and he said,"It's when old 
 people fall down the coach steps".    
       When it was time to go back to  
 school the man said," I will give you 
 a ride up in a coach."
