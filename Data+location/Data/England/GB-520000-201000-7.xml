		<title>07Major Roads</title>
		<content> The major existing road was the A1(M),
 a motorway that started just south of 
 this area and ran north towards Welwyn
 Garden City.  The road was completely 
 cut off from the surrounding smaller  
 roads - one od which was the old A1.  
 The A6 left the A1 just to the south  
 of the area, and this also was heavily
 used by traffic.                      
                                       
 To the south, the new London Orbital  
 Motorway, the M25, was being          
 constructed.  The eastern part was    
 finished, but building the western    
 link was causing major disruptions to 
 village life.  There was a large      
 encampment of road-builders caravans  
 in one place.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
