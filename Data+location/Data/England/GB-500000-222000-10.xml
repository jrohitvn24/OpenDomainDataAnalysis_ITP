 Changing Times continued ...          
                                       
                                       
 Education now follows a three tier    
 system and the Grammer Schools have   
 disappeared.The typical working day   
 for a man in the 1930's was from      
 6.00am until 3.00pm and now its from  
 9.00am until 5.00pm.One of the reasons
 why the unemployment level was low was
 that there were more opportunities for
 apprentices in the industries         
 connected with the motor manufacture
