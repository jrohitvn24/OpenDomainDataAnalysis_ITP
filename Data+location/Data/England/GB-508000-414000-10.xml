		<content> Our Church is very old. There was a   
 Church in Ulceby when the first       
 Domesday Book was written. The Church 
 is near the school and one of the     
 Vicars who was called Mr. Flowers,    
 ordered our old school to be built in 
 l84O. You can see a picture of Mr.    
 Flowers in the Church window above the
 children's altar. He is at the back   
 but you can tell who he is by his side
 whiskers. The spire was added later   
 but it has been repaired lots of      
 times. Two years ago we made some     
 little cardboard spires to collect    
 money to repair the spire.Â£3OO was    
 collected and the top part of the     
 spire was built up again. It cost more
 than Â£3O.OOO altogether. There is a   
 sundial in the Churchyard but most of 
 the grave stones have been taken up.  
 There used to be a chimney and a      
 boilerhouse.                          </content>
