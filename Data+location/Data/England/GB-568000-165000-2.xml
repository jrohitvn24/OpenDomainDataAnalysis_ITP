		<title>02The Village of Cuxton</title>
		<content> Most people live in Cuxton itself.    
 Some live further along the main road 
 towards Halling and a few in the      
 hamlet of Upper Bush. There are 1240  
 houses in Cuxton. The population of   
 the village is about 3150. A busy main
 road{(A228)}cuts through the village. 
 This divides the railway station, a   
 small industrial site by the river and
 the White Hart public house, from the 
 main centre of population. Most houses
 are semi-detached and were built in   
 the 1960s. There are a few older      
 houses, the oldest built in the 14th  
 Century. There is a small Parade of   
 shops, a Police Office, Social Club,  
 filling station and a garage. The     
 Primary School is next to the         
 recreation ground. Above the village, 
 to the south, stands the{Norman church
 of St Michael's and All Angels which, 
 this year celebrates the 800th (cont) </content>
