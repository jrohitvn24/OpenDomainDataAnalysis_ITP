		<title>20Bury Hill, Iron Age Fort.</title>
		<content>     Bury Hill is a piece of land      
 surrounded by trees. It has a footpath
 that goes all the way round. The      
 ground is covered by roots, long and  
 short grass and also soil.            
     The trees that we saw at Bury Hill
 are Oak, Sycamore, Pine, Beech and    
 Holly.                                
     If you stand in the middle of Bury
 Hill you are only able to see trees   
 because they block the view. However, 
 if you travel to the edge of Bury Hill
 you can see a long way. I could see   
 lots of fields in every direction.    
     There is a ditch surrounding the  
 hill. The sides were steep and very   
 slippery. I could see many different  
 kinds of birds.                       
     The Hill used to be an iron-age   
 fort but now it is a pleasant place   
 for people to walk.
