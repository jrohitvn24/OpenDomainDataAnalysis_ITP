		<content> Watchet is a small busy port on the   
{Bristol Channel.}The town lies between
 the Quantocks and the Brendons and has
 roads leading to{Taunton, Bridgwater  
 and{Minehead}and a steam railway (for 
 the tourists) to go to{Minehead}or    
{Taunton.}Watchet has a busy little    
 harbour for small pleasure boats and  
 large ships that visit 2 or 3 times a 
 week. There are two large factories,  
 the{Paper Mill}which makes paper and  
{Protective Papers}who print on papers,
 these factories also need two large   
 lorry companies. As Watchet is near   
 the sea many people come on holiday   
 therefore tourists are important.The  
 old streets around the harbour have   
 lots of small shops,banks,pubs and    
 there is a large{Recreation Ground    
 where people play football and cricket
 there are swings as well.Over 3,000   
 people live here.                     </content>
