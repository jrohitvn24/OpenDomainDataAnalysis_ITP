		<title>09    Greengrocery Shop</title>
		<content>    Mr and Mrs Stockwell's greengrocery
 shop is a small family business in the
 traditional style with an open front. 
 We can talk to the shopkeeper from out
 in the street. The Stockwells have run
 the shop for 38 years and both of them
 love the life. Mr Stockwell told us   
 that if he hadn't been a shopkeeper he
 would have liked to work with young   
 people. In a way, he already does,    
 because he spends part of the day as  
 road crossing patrol, seeing us safely
 across the street on our way to and   
 from school.                          
    Every day he has fresh stock       
 delivered. He sells some groceries, as
 well as fruit and vegetables. Most    
 people buy potatoes there, but he also
 stocks asparagus for those who want   
 something special.
