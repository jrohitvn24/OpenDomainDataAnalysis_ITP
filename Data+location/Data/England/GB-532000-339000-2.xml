		<title>02St. LEODEGAR'S CHURCH</title>
		<content>       { St. Leodegar's church         
 According to the{Domesday Book},there 
 was a church on this site in 1086.Two 
 stone-heads were dug up in the        
 churchyard in 1956;these were         
 identified as Normans. It is beleived 
 to be all that is left of the first   
 church.                               
   St.Leodegar was a French bishop and 
 it was thought that the church was    
 dedicated to him because Wyberton was 
 given to{Count Alan of Brittany}as    
 part of his reward for fighting in the
 battle of Hastings.                   
   The{Norman}church was replaced in   
 the 13th C.The new church was big and 
 the remains of the big pillars were   
 found,only the bases still stand.It   
 had a tower at the centre of the      
 church between the Nave and the       
 Chancel.In 1419 the tower fell        
 destroying most of the church.        </content>
