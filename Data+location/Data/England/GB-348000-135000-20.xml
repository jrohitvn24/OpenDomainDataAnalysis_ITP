		<title>20Urban and Rural Rubbish.</title>
		<content>    People don't take enough trouble to
 care for Street. There are enough     
 litter bins around but rubbish is     
 dumped in the street or drains because
 some can't be bothered to use bins.   
    Young people are often to blame    
 because teenagers who leave school    
 jobless often hang around in the High 
 Street and write on walls.            
    Litter does not occur only in the  
 town but also in the country. Examples
 found are tin baths, sinks, rolls of  
 carpet and cars. Lots of rubbish gets 
 into streams and pollutes the water   
 killing the fish.                     
    Of litter, graffiti, rubbish and   
 vandalism, vandalism is worst because 
 graffiti can be painted over, litter  
 rots into the ground and rubbish is   
 often picked up.                      
    Vandalism is worst because it costs
 so much to put right.                 </content>
