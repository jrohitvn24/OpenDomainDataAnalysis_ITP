		<title>12Battlesbridge Antique centre</title>
		<content> The centre consists of several antique
 shops on the North bank of the River  
 Crouch,(map ref.783986).The buildings 
 were originally mills powered by river
 water.The disused mills,old shops and 
 a cowshed,were used for the storage of
 antique furniture.As they were on the 
 busy A130,many people passed by so the
 resale side began.There is an         
 extremely wide range of goods on sale;
 small articles of jewellery,pictures, 
 fire places.all types of furniture and
 even church pews.The antiques come    
 from auctions,private houses but most 
 are bought through the trade.Many     
 antiques are exported to Europe and   
 America.These are some examples of    
 prices:12 seat dining table Â£800,     
 Pedistal desk Â£400,Victorian trumpet  
 work box Â£450,Edwardian chest of      
 drawers Â£85,Pine dresser Â£700.Also    
 antiques are renovated and upholstered</content>
