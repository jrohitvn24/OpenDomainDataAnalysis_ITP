		<title>16CROP GROWING: ACTON/L'HAM</title>
		<content>Area comprises approx. 3000 acres, di- 
vided into 10 farms of 200 acres or    
less and one of 1000 acres.            
Main crops in order of acreage grown   
are wheat, barley, oats, oil seed rape,
peas beans and sugar beet. Harvest     
completed the grain is stored on the   
farms and sold as and where the market 
dictates in lots of 1000 tons. Wheat is
milled solely for domestic use. Beans  
are grown for cattle food and peas are 
marketed as dried peas.                
The clay soil is self-sufficient in    
potash but nitrogen and phosphates are 
added in spring. Land is drained regu- 
larly, the small farms using contrac-  
tors. All farm machinery (combine har- 
vesters, crop sprayers, tractors, etc) 
are owned by the farmer.               
EEC rules and regulations have not to  
any great extent curtailed the acreage 
of cereals grown in this area.         </content>
