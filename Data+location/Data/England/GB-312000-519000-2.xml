		<title>02WATER EXTRACTION, CRUMMOCK.</title>
		<content> Crummock Water is 4km long with a     
 maximum depth of 43.9m and has a      
 volume of 66.4 million cu.m. Crummock 
 Water is the main domestic water      
 source for Allerdale District i.e.    
 Cockermouth, Harrington, Workington,  
 Maryport and parts of Aspatria. It    
 supplies up to 31,822 cu.m. per day.  
 The water is pumped to Cornhow        
 treatment works where it undergoes    
 purification. Some  Lakeland water is 
 relatively pure so that it only needs 
 Chlorine added to destroy bacteria.   
 The water from Crummock, however, is  
 passed through fine microstrainers    
 to remove organic debris. A sample of 
 water is taken weekly to Workington   
 laboratory for extensive analysis, to 
 ensure that water released into the   
 public supply is safe to drink. Tests 
 for Chloride &amp; Fluoride levels &amp; pH   
 are undertaken daily at Cornhow.      </content>
