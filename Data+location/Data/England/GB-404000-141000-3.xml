		<title>03CHERRY LODGE FARM.(con'd)</title>
		<content> There are also foxes, rabbits and     
 badgers on the farm.The downland is   
 very old and has not been ploughed for
 a very long time.It is covered with   
 hundreds of anthills. The sheep and   
 cattle graze on the grass and keep it 
 short.This allows the large number of 
 wild flowers to grow.The cattle are a 
 rare breed called Longhorn Cattle.    
 There are 21 cattle and 6 calves. They
 live between 16 and 20 years.On the   
 farm there are also 1147 Scottish half
 breed  sheep. On one side of the      
 reserve is a dew pond that has been   
 recently cleaned out.                 
   There are also important            
 archaeological features on the        
 reserve, including the remains of a   
 field system,strip lynchets, a bowl   
 barrow, and possible Saxon field      
 boundaries.
