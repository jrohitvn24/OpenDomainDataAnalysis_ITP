		<content>   'Long Edge Bulldozing a Devastating 
 Loss'                                 
 That was the title of the Congleton   
 Chronicle on Friday 17th May 1985.A   
 large part of the woodland at Long    
 Edge ,which links Biddulph Park with  
 Cloud End,was destroyed by the owner. 
 It is believed that many forms of     
 wildlife existed there including at   
 least one species of rare butterfly.  
 'It is a total destruction of very    
 decreasing wildlife.Basically it is   
 vandalism,'said a spokesman.          
 A bulldozer was used to uproot all the
 vegetation.Roots,branches and trunks  
 were burned.All the stone was         
 removed,some of it being massive      
 boulders of millstone grit.The land   
 amounting to several acres was graded 
 and sown with grass seed. It is now a 
 green field to be used for grazing.
