{Cranmore Industrial Estate.}It was    
 established more recently and consists
 of 38 units. They are mainly          
 warehouses although two of the firms  
 manufactured exhibition stands.       
 Banks, planted with mainly deciduous  
 trees, surround the units, screening  
 them from the new housing estates.    
 There are still about 1/3 of the units
 unoccupied.                           
 About 50% of the work force live      
 locally. They like getting to work    
 easily and all agreed that they       
 enjoyed working in pleasant           
 surroundings.                         
 All the information on these two pages
 about industry came from surveys and  
 interviews carried on the industrial  
 estate.
