		<content>A FIREMAN puts out fires in houses,    
factories of in the streets. They also 
help people if they are trapped. If a  
cat has got stuck up a tree they will  
get it down.                           
AN AMBULANCE MAN comes to take you to  
hospital if you are ill or have had a  
bad accident. Sometimes ambulance men  
take women to hospital to have a baby. 
DOCTORS AND NURSES look after sick     
people and try to make them better.    
Sometimes people have to have an       
operation and stay in hospital for a   
long time.                             
A SHOPKEEPER is someone who works in a 
shop selling different kinds of        
products. Sometimes we go to a local   
shop for food and sometimes we go to   
town to buy clothes.
