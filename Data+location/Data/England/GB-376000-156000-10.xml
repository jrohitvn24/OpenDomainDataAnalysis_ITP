		<title>10POPULATION:HINTON CHARTERHSE</title>
		<content>  THERE IS CONSIDERABLE{COMMUNITY      
{FEELING}AMONG THE POPULATION OF HINTON
 CHARTERHOUSE, WHICH RUNS A VERY ACTIVE
 PARISH COUNCIL. THIS IS CONCERNED WITH
 MANY ASPECTS OF VILLAGE LIFE, SUCH AS 
 IMPROVING THE FACILITIES OFFERED BY   
 THE MEMORIAL HALL, THE PROVISION OF A 
 LAYBY, AND PROVIDING FOR THE MANY     
 ELDERLY PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE.        
  ANOTHER CAUSE FOR CONCERN IS THE FACT
 THAT THE CHILDREN OF THE VILLAGE HAVE 
 TO TRAVEL TO FRESHFORD FOR THEIR      
 JUNIOR SCHOOL EDUCATION. THIS VILLAGE 
 IS SOME DISTANCE AWAY, THE OTHER SIDE 
 OF A BUSY MAIN ROAD. THE{JUNIOR SCHOOL
 IN HINTON CHARTERHOUSE WAS CLOSED A   
 FEW YEARS AGO, DUE TO FALLING ROLLS,  
 SO THE PARENTS OF THE VILLAGE'S       
 CHILDREN HAVE NO CHOICE. IT IS        
 PROBABLY BECAUSE OF THIS THAT THERE   
 ARE VERY FEW YOUNG FAMILIES IN THE    
 VILLAGE AT PRESENT.                   </content>
