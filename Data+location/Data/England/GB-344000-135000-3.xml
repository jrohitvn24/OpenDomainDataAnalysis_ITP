		<title>03Walton Windmill</title>
		<content>    This windmill was built on{Walton  
{Hill}in 1741 replacing earlier        
 post_mill types  dating back to the   
 14th century.   Local{legend}suggests 
 that the{Duke of Monmouth}stayed at   
 the mill on this site after his defeat
 at the{Battle of Sedgemoor}in 1685,   
 before his capture and execution in   
 London.  This stone built mill        
 originally had a thatched wooden roof 
 revolving to enable the sails to catch
 the wind .                            
   The mill was owned during the 18th  
 century by the Maquis of Bath before  
 falling into dereliction at the       
 beginning of the 20th century.  In    
 1926 the mill was converted into a    
 dwelling by the Rev G.M. Evans and    
 continues in use as a home in 1985.
