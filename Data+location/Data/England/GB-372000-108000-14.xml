		<title>14Changes in Hazelbury Bryan</title>
		<content>   Not much has changed in the         
 landscape of Hazelbury Bryan over the 
 years. However, people keep themselves
 very much to themselves nowadays, and 
 I blame television. Country crafts are
 almost a thing of the past. It is not 
 like the old days when all was quiet  
 all day. Now cars and motorbikes tear 
 about, creating havoc. The children   
 are still as cheerful as ever,        
 although they lack discipline. Clothes
 are better in quality and design, but 
 people seem to wear anything.         
   Shopping is difficult, with only a  
 general store in the village. The bus 
 service is poor, it doesn't give us   
 enough time to shop. If I had my way, 
 I'd bring back the horse and cart,    
 stop people modernising the fronts of 
 old houses, and use cheaper materials 
 for houses so that young families     
 could settle.                         </content>
