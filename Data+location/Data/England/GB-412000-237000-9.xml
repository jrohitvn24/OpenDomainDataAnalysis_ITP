 Spring Holiday {Dover's Hill}is the   
 scene of the Games. The hill is a     
 natural arena and the first games were
 held on them in 1644. There are       
 fireworks and a torchlight procession 
 down Dyer's Lane to Campden Square and
 dancing. The next day is{Scuttlebrook 
{Wake.}A fun fair with sideshows fills 
 the street at Leysbourne. In the      
 afternoon a fancy dress parade starts 
 from Littleworth.It is preceded by the
 Scuttlebrook Queen-elect on a         
 decorated float drawn by the Morris   
 men. The band leads them to the       
 Square. There the queen is crowned,   
 prizes are awarded, Campden Morris    
 dance their traditional dances        
 followed by the schoolchildren with   
 country dances and the Maypole. At the
 end of the ceremony with the children 
 chafing to be off, the fair opens.    </content>
