		<title>06HOUSING IN CRAWCROOK</title>
		<content> The most modern estate in the area    
 began over 5 years ago. It is situated
 on the south of Main Street in        
 Crawcrook. Built on farmland, it      
 continues to grow year by year and    
 will eventually contain well over 500 
 houses and a Primary School.          
 A variety of dwellings can be found:  
 link villas, bungalows, semi-detached 
 and detached houses as well as        
 timber-framed buildings and housing   
 four flats each.                      
 The latest development conatins       
 individually designed detached houses 
 on their own sites. This is in        
 contrast to the majority of the estate
 which consists of fairly small rooms  
 built together.                       
 Most houses sre built with red brick  
 and roofing tiles. Window frames are  
 mainly wooden and almost all gutters  
 and pipes are plastic.                </content>
