		<title>06MAIDSTONE'S BUS SYSTEM</title>
		<content>  Bus routes in the centre of Maidstone
 are complex and circuitous, especially
 because of the one-way system. The bus
 station at the bottom of{Stone Street 
 used to be the only terminal. The main
 information office and National Bus   
 Company offices are found here.       
  The construction of the{Stoneborough 
 Centre saw the creation of a second   
 terminal under the Centre's east wing.
 This has 8 stops, each catering for   
 several services, mostly local. Many  
 other town centre stops are used,     
 especially close to the{High Street}-{
{King Street junction.}Less-local buses
 are routed from the old terminus, but 
 some use both termini. All services   
 are frequently held up by rush-hour   
 traffic. Operation of these services  
 may again be radically changed if the 
 latest road building proposals are    
 carried through.                      </content>
