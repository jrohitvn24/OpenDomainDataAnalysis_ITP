		<title>06A NEWCOMER'S FAMILY</title>
		<content> Within sight of the Brook family home 
 at Clock House Farm is Waterhall      
 Cottage.The young people who live     
 there,like the Brooks,love the        
 Sampfords countryside.Unlike them,they
 have only been there for two and a    
 half years.The two families epitomise 
 the contempory rural population.Paul  
 and Phyllis Hunter came to Waterhall  
 Cottage to escape the noise and bustle
 of town life although they still      
 commute daily to London where Paul    
 works as a lawyer. Phyllis comes from 
 the State of Massachusetts in America 
 and in the eight years she has lived  
 here has come to love England.Their   
 home is typical of the area,a small   
 timber framed,plastered thatched      
 cottage in a small garden with        
 beautiful views over the surrounding  
 countryside.Two village families,two  
 generations enjoying country life.    </content>
