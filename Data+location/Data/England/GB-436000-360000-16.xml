		<title>16Swimming at Clay Cross Baths</title>
		<content>   Each week junior children from      
{Stretton Handley School}go on the bus 
 to{Sharley Park Baths}for swimming.   
 Here are two{junior children's}views: 
                                       
 On the way to the swimming baths      
 Everybody jokes and laughs            
 While everybody all around            
 Looks tiny and fixed to the ground    
 The ride is smooth but sometimes bumpy
 The road is wide and very lumpy.      
                                       
 When we get to the baths we go through
 a smell of disinfectant and into the  
 changing rooms.  They are stuffy and  
 smell of chlorine.When we get in the  
 baths we have to swim six widths in   
 the silvery, smooth liquid.We then go 
 to the deep end of the pool and dive  
 in.The pressure of the water makes    
 your ears go pop so you come up and   
 breathe a chloriney mouth full of air.</content>
