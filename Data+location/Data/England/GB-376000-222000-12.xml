		<title>12COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE</title>
		<content> Gloucester College of Agriculture was 
 established in Hartpury House in 1949.
 The accommodation, amid congenial     
 surroundings, comprises classrooms,   
 workshops, laboratories, greenhouses, 
 library, hall, offices and residential
 hostels for 80 students. Students are 
 able to study the principles and      
 practices of agriculture to National  
 Diploma (Agri) and National Cert. of  
 Agriculture standard, and horticulture
 to City and Guilds. The theory is     
 supplemented by practical training on 
 two farms, which have dairy herds, a  
 ewe and a pig unit as well as growing 
 cereal crops and potatoes. Short,     
 interesting extra-mural courses for   
 local people are run in the Rural     
 Homecraft Centre for cooking and      
 domestic crafts. For Beekeeping the   
 College maintains a variety of hives, 
 including a Medieval Bee House.       </content>
