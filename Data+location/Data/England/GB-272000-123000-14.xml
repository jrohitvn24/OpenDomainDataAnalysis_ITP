    The church was built on the present
 site towards the end of the 12th      
 century.It was consecrated Whitsun.The
 oldest part of the church is the      
 front, which is Norman.               
    The church itself was rebuilt in   
 the 15th century and this church was  
 restored in 1603.                     
    In the church now there are many   
 clubs such as{Quest Club,Notes,Prayer 
{Group,Bible Group,Choir Practice,Work 
{shop,Summer Club and Criss Cross Quiz.
    There was a vicar who died of black
 death and he was called William       
 Balraven De Sevtham.Before the church 
 was of stone it was built wood.There  
 are 413 gravestones in the graveyard.
