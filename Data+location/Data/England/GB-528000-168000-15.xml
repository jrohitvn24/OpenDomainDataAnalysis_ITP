		<title>15A Typical Day</title>
		<content> I get up in the morning, I have a wash
 and brush my teeth.  I spend about ten
 minutes and five to get dressed.  Then
 I go downstairs and have cereal, I eat
 that, then have two slices of toast.  
 I turn on the television. I watch     
 that, and my dad might say we are     
 going out.  When we come back I would 
 find something to eat, read my book,  
 for about an hour.  I might go in my  
 garden and play football. I come back 
 inside and watch the television. I am 
 usually bored so I read or write -    
 scribble silly things.  Then my dad   
 asks me if I want a game of snooker on
 my snooker table.  We play about three
 games. Then at about 11.00pm my dad   
 might say, "Time for bed Simon".      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
