		<content> We asked some children in our block   
 what pets they had . They mostly had  
 dogs and hamsters came next.The dogs  
 were fed on meat and the hamsters on  
 hamster food ,the dogs were fed once a
 day and the hamsters twice .We asked  
 the children about gardens too.They   
 mostly had daffodils and roses.They   
 had lots of trees and here are some of
 them ,willows,fir and a larch.We asked
 the children about what food they ate.
 They mostly grew carrots and peas and 
 they mostly ate cereal for breakfast. 
 They had a mixture of gas and electric
 cookers. The most popular fruit was   
 apples and only one person ate        
 oranges.
