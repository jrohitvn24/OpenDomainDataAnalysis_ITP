		<content>   The name 'Kilndown' is ancient, but 
the village dates from the nineteenth  
century, when Lord Beresford of        
Bedgebury built the Church (1840) and  
Church Cottages, and his wife built    
the School (1846). So, most of the     
houses were built after that date,     
many by the Estates of Scotney,        
Bedgebury or the Crown. Since the war, 
some council houses and a small        
council estate have accounted for most 
of the Village. A limited amount of    
building is still going on, one house  
being completed earlier this year.     
   There are several notable old       
houses. Twyssenden Manor is a fine     
timber building, until last year being 
a Youth Hostel. Twysden House dates    
from 1485, about the same date as      
Gatehouse (on sale for 385,000).       
Spelmonden was once the home of the    
ironmasters of the Horsmonden Furnace. </content>
