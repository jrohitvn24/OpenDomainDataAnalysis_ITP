		<title>07ST EDMUND'S CHURCH</title>
		<content> St Edmunds Church is unusual because  
 it faces south although most churches 
 face east so that they are pointing to
 the Holy Land. The most holy part of  
 the church is the sanctuary because   
 that is where the Communion is held.  
 The Goddard Room was built most       
 recently and it commemorates Mr       
 Goddard who worked hard to have the   
 church built. The main part of the    
 church is called the nave because it  
 comes from the word navy as it looks  
 like an upturned boat. The church is  
 also used as a community centre for   
 meetings and playgroups.
