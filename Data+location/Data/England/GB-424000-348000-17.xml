		<content>  Comments from a lifelong resident.   
{Roads.}The road between Kirk          
 Ireton and Hopton should have passing 
 places. This is our main bus route.   
 Buses, milk tankers, corn lorries etc.
 take up most of the road. Blackwall   
 Lane blind bends should be removed to 
 improve visibility. Broom Lane lower  
 end needs improving.                  
{School.}This is now in a good state of
 repair and we must ensure that there  
 are enough children to keep it open.  
 It is the centre of village life and  
 occupies an ideal site in the centre  
 of the village. The{village shop, Post
{Office}and the limited{bus service}we 
 have, must all be retained.           
{Village Hall.}This is used a lot more 
 these days and various improvements   
 have been made. It is hoped that soon 
 play equipment will be placed on the  
 open space in Peats Close.            </content>
