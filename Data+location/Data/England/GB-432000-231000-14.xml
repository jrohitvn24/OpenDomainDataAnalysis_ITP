		<title>14HOOK NORTON -RELIGION</title>
		<content>St. Peter's Church is a Norman church  
built about 900 years ago in the shape 
of a cross.We sketched the windows     
which had a story in them. The font is 
about 700 years old and someone in Hook
Norton probably carved it. The carvings
include a mixture of ideas from the    
Bible and Astrology. On the font Eve is
holding an apple and a fig leaf.Adam is
holding a spade and a rake. Sagitarius 
is Good,Aquarius is Evil.The story of  
Noah's Ark is in the Bible. Aries      
reminds us of the Lamb of God. The     
Evengelists are Matthew,Luke, John and 
Mark. The font is used for christening 
people. It is so big because they used 
to put babies into it. The cross is on 
the behalf of God and Jesus. When the  
baby is baptized the parents and       
godparents are made to promise to      
fight evil and to care for the child.
