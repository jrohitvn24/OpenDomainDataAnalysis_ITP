		<content> Within our 'box' there is no          
 conservation (in the by now generally 
 accepted sense) that we know of, with 
 the exception of the Test Way, which  
 runs north/south along the route of   
 the old 'Sprat and Winkle' railway    
 line. This is being developed as a    
 long distance footpath, and the bodies
 concerned in its upkeep are keen to   
 make its habitats more beneficial to  
 wildlife.  Mottisfont, a National     
 Trust property, is within our area,   
 and it might be relevant to record    
 that the collection of traditional    
 varieties of rose is very carefully   
 nurtured.   The Test is               
 keepered, as are many of the woods,   
 both for rough and game shooting.     
 Any benefits keepering has for        
 wildlife are coincidental.
