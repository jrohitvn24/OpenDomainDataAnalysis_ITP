		<title>17CALMORE INDUSTRIAL ESTATE</title>
		<content> In 1965 the first industry developed  
 around Nutsey Lane.The 1st.stage of   
 the estate was built about 1979,the   
 2nd.in 1983, there is a 3rd.and final 
 stage which will initially consist of 
 a cement works in the centre of the   
 new area. { The estate is  built      
{upon farmland reclaimed from gravel   
{workings.}Many firms have warehouses  
 or salepoints here,mostly in small    
 scale units,but there is little       
 manufacturing on the site.The{site was
{chosen to cause the minimum of        
{annoyance to local residents;there is 
{an effective tree screening between it
{and the housing estate and the        
{prevailing wind carries any pollution 
{away from the housing areas.There have
 been very few complaints over the     
 years from local residents.
