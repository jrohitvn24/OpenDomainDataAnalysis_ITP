		<title>18BROXBOURNEBURY/THE HOUSE</title>
		<content> Original building built in 1059 for   
 Stigand, Archbishop of Canterbury &amp;   
 mentioned in the Domesday Book.       
 Rebuilt in l544 it was altered &amp;      
 largely rebuilt in the l9th century.  
 Red brick with some decorative        
 stonework &amp; many l8th century windows 
 built around a quadrangle, it         
 comprises 3 floors, over 100 rooms &amp;  
 attics. Some  chimney stacks &amp; a 1st  
 floor fireplace are l6th century.     
 Since being bought by the Herts.      
 County Council in l946 it has been a  
 Special Day &amp; Boarding School. A      
 ground floor extension of classrooms  
 has been added to the north west wing 
 and a swimming pool built near the    
 school. In early l984 dry rot was     
 discovered which has necessitated     
 replacement of many timbers from      
 cellars to roof. Work continues to    
 restore the building.                 </content>
