      Both Cassinelli's and The Beeches
 catered for weddings and other        
 celebrations, including children's    
 parties, but Cassinelli's provided    
 more entertainment, with 3 discoteques
 per week, disc jockeys, comedians and 
 cabaret artists as well as piped      
 music.  Most of their bookings were   
 from family groups or young people,   
 whereas The Beeches expected a large  
 proportion of businessmen amongst     
 their clients.                        
      At Cassinelli's the most popular 
 dishes were steak and pizza - the     
 theme of the restaurant and its menu  
 are Italian - but the most popular    
 dish at The Beeches was fish.
