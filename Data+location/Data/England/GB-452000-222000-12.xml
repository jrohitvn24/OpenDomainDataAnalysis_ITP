		<title>12 LOCAL VIEWS OF THE VILLAGE</title>
		<content>    Middleton Stoney is a very quiet   
and relaxed village with a friendly    
atmosphere.The only bone of contention 
is the heavy traffic on the main       
road.Local residents remember the time 
when cricket and football were played  
on the same road with occasional       
interuptions by a car.                 
    The older residents have moved to  
the council bungalows from the older   
estate houses, these have now been     
purchased by commuters and             
weekenders.These bungalows are modern  
and much safer for the older           
residents.Many of whom are old and     
unfirm.                                
   Many of the properties vacated are  
now occupied by weekenders especially  
from London and this gives the village 
a deserted look during the week.       
    Clock Court is a converted stable  
area with three permanent residents.   </content>
