		<title>14Thurlow's social clubs</title>
		<content> A Brownie pack meets in the village,  
 but Guides has folded up and Cubs and 
 Scouts meet at Stetchworth and        
 Stradishall. The mother and toddler   
 group has enjoyed renewed success with
 20 or so young mums. There is a strong
 Mothers Union whose monthly afternoon 
 meetings include a religious service  
 and a speaker. The lively W I meets   
 monthly in the evening with cookery   
 and craft competitions, entertainment 
 and speakers, and maintains links with
 other village WIs. A surprising lack  
 in this village is an over 60s club,  
 so popular in other villages. However 
 Thurlow's older residents seem to have
 themselves well enough organised and  
 cared for without one. Attempts to    
 start a youth club have also failed.  
 The British Legion &amp; Order of         
 Buffaloes have branches here.
