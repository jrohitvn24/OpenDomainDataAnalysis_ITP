		<content>   Guides were started in 1919_1920 by 
 Lady Olivia Baden Powell and her      
 husband Lord Baden Powell on October  
 the 3rd 1923.Here in Shifnal the      
 scouts and guides have never worked   
 together in anything.In 1958 there was
 a meeting to decide where to place the
 Scout Group and Guide Company;the     
 group was placed in St.Andrews church.
 In 1978 the scouts and guides decided 
 that they wanted a place of their own.
 There were a lot of buildings possible
 for them to use.                      
    At last they decided on a patch of 
 land called Dyers Bank between the    
 church and Oakley's Garage.It used to 
 be a telephone exchange.The plans were
 drawn up and they were all set to     
 build when they did a test on the land
 and found that it was very marshy     
 thirteen feet down,and it was         
 unfit to build on.                    </content>
