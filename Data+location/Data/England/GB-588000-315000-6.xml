		<title>06  EMPLOYMENT IN LITCHAM</title>
		<content> The school is the main employer in    
this area.It employs 34 teachers;22    
fulltime and 5 part time.It also       
employs 9 ancillary staff for jobs like
cleaners and secretaries.It also       
affects other jobs in Litcham i.e the  
local coach company.It also has a      
marginal affect on local grocery and   
butchers shops.There are many different
small shops in the area which employ   
2-5 people each.                       
 Another main source of employment in  
East Anglia,is farming.However,the need
for the farm labourer has decreased    
dramatically since farm machinery      
became popular.This has meant a slight 
move towards office jobs in larger     
towns,or even self-employment.The      
recession,however,has taken its toll.
