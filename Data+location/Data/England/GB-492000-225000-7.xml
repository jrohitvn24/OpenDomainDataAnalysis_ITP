		<content> A survey of the school's catchment    
 area within the study area provided us
 with information. Most lived in semi- 
 detached houses and most people had at
 least three bedrooms and a garden     
 large enough for children to play in. 
 Housing was either council rented or  
 privately owned. Most houses have at  
 least two children and two adults.    
 Nearly all homes had one person in    
 full-time employment but 25% had one  
 person in the home unemployed. 13%    
 were single parent families. There was
 a nearly equal distribution of those  
 people who attended church regularly, 
 rarely or nver and people were        
 predominately Church of England in    
 denomination. The most popular way of 
 getting to work was on foot or by car.
 Bicycles were also quite popular but  
 users of public transport were very   
 small in number.                      </content>
