 In the same building as Edmondson     
 Brothers,which used to be one big     
 weaving mill,is a larger works where  
 carpets are made.Mrs Carradice has    
 worked there for ten years and the    
 works employ 100 people,some of them  
 teenagers.There are 50 different      
 carpet names.The wool for the carpets 
 comes in big sacks from               
 Huddersfield,and the carpets are 80   
 per cent wool and 20 per cent nylon,  
 a man made fibre.The carpets are woven
 on big looms in a noisy room and are  
 checked for any mistakes before being 
 sold. If there are any big faults     
 these are"mended" in the factory. Some
 of the smaller carpets are exported to
 America.The firm has a retail shop    
 called Royd Mill where people can buy 
 carpets and rugs.
