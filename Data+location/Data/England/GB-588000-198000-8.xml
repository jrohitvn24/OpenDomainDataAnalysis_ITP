		<title>08GIRLS FASHION   PART 2</title>
		<content> Ans:=The most popular crazes were     
 discos,Breakdancing,Love and Pop      
 groups. We like both fashions         
 equally.We like boys baggy trousers   
 and we like girls baggy tops and we   
 like tight jeans.We like three good   
 pop groups they are Wham!,Duran Duran 
 and Paul Young.We both like Paul Young
 but Emma doesn't like Wham that much  
 and I don't like Duran Duran that     
 much.The television programmes we like
 best are EastEnders and Dallas,we     
 think they are excellent.On television
 there are a lot of American programmes
 like Dallas,Chips,The Fall Guy,Cover  
 Up,Dynasty,Knight Rider and lots more.
  Hair styles have changed over the    
 past two years.In 1984 the girls hair 
 style that was in fashion was The Bob.
 In 1985 most girls have very short    
 hair.
