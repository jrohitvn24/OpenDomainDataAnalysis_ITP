		<title>17AMY'S FAMILY WEEKEND-SUNDAY</title>
		<content> On Sunday I woke up at 10.00am,had    
 breakfast and got ready for church.   
 I sing in choir with my mum and dad.  
 The service begins at 11.00am and was 
 communion and I put the candles out   
 after it. At 12.00 we went home in the
 rain and while mum and dad read       
 I played with my doll's house. At     
 2.00pm we had our Sunday lunch. After 
 that we all played monopoly until tea 
 time and dad won. At 4.30pm we had    
 baked beans on toast for tea I washed 
 up and John dried. Then we rode on our
 bikes until it was time for bed. When 
 we were ready dad read us a story and 
 we went to sleep about 9.00pm.        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
