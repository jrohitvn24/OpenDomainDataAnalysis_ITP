		<title>19An Italian Family, St Ives</title>
		<content> This family live in Bridge Terrace in 
 St Ives. Mother and father moved to   
 England in 1971. They have three      
 children, Donata, Filomena and        
 Michelle, aged 13, 11 and 9           
 respectively. The two eldest children 
 attend St Ivo Comprehensive school and
 the youngest attends Hemingford Grey  
 primary school.                       
                                       
 The parents have become used to living
 in a foreign country. They tend to    
 lead an Italian form of life at home. 
 Although the children were born in    
 England, the  whole family speak      
 Italian at home. Mother still finds   
 English a little difficult. They have 
 relations living locally and in Ely.  
                                       
 The main differences they find are    
 shop opening hours and the weather.
