 The school house is very old.It used  
 to be a church house.It was rented by 
 the church from Lord Portsmouth and   
 was used for a meeting and drinking   
 place.It then became a poor house. In 
 1800 it was rebuilt for Â£60.In 1855   
 Lord Portsmouth let it for a school.  
 School was upstairs and the poor were 
 downstairs.In 1868 the National School
 was built.This is now the junior room.
 In 1874 a School Board was formed to  
 build on another room for infants.We  
 use this as part of the junior        
 classroom now.In 1952 the kitchen was 
 added on.In 1968 the infants moved    
 into a new wooden classroom.The Head  
 lived in the school house until       
 1980.Since then it has been used as   
 part of the school facilities.It is a 
 Grade II Listed Building.
