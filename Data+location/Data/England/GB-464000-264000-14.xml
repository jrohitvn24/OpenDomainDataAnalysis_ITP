		<content>   Each year we have a week of         
activities leading up to the Fete.     
   Fete week 1985 started on Saturday, 
15th. June, with a disco and at 8      
o'clock Sarah Couchman won the Miss    
Kilndown Competition. On Sunday we had 
an obstacle race, also a Church        
Festival Service. On Monday we had a   
Darts and Pool competition and on      
Tuesday a Flower Show. On Wednesday    
there was Bingo at the pub, followed by
Morris Dancing. On Thursday there were 
Keep Fit Displays. The Friday Treasure 
Hunt was postponed until Sunday        
because of rain. On Fete Day there     
was a procession from the Globe and    
Rainbow with Miss Kilndown leading     
floats and a Jazz Band and old         
fashioned cars. There were lots of     
games and stalls. The 1,114 pounds     
raised went to sixteen different       
village organisations and funds.       </content>
