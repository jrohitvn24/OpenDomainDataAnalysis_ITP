		<content> There is no shopping centre in        
 Longhope and the local people have to 
 supplement the facilities of{village  
{shop , butcher and post office}by the 
 variety of{mobile traders}who call    
 regularly.There is a{baker,           
{greengrocer,fishmonger,laundry and    
{fish and chip van}in addition to the  
 normal{milkman and postman}.People    
 also use mail order catalogues or     
 travel to the main shopping centres in
 nearby towns.This is a problem for    
 those with no car but we found a      
 strong community spirit meant people  
 were willing to fetch items and offer 
 transport.The local tradespeople are  
 finding it hard to compete against    
 supermarket prices and variety.
