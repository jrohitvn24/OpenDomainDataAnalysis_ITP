		<title>09RECREATION IN BRANSTON</title>
		<content> Branston has a large number of little 
 clubs, (see clubs). It also has a     
 community college which runs evening  
 classes and has a swimming pool. We   
 wanted to find how many people used   
 the comprehensive facilties and what  
 people did in their spare time so we  
 interviewed 1% of the village. We     
 asked people questions like: Which    
 form of recreation do you enjoy the   
 most? Most people clearly preferred   
 watching TV to doing anything else.   
 But other people enjoyed things like  
 fishing,walking and sporting events.  
 People rarely seemed to use the       
 comprehensive. We were quite surprised
 at this because the comprehensive runs
 clubs and evening classes.These cover 
 a wide variety of subjects including  
 metal work,language courses and       
 cookery.We thought that these would be
 more popular.                         </content>
