<title>32Farming at North Farm 2011</title>
<content>

At this farm there have been many changes since 1986. Some of these have come about because of the problems within farming itself, for example milk pricing and sickness in animals which have forced farmers into re-thinking about the use of their land and how to make a living.&lt;br />&lt;br />Since 2005 there have been no dairy cows here and the barns have been converted to other uses.&lt;br />&lt;br />There are still approximately 700 acres but they are used solely for arable farming.The farm has changed hands and is no longer owned by a dairy firm who processed and distributed the milk.&lt;br />&lt;br />A family company now own the acres and the son is resident as the manager.The previous "modern" farm bungalow has been replaced by a very large farmhouse in a lovely position with amazing views.The security is very tight and no one can approach the house without an entry code.Is this a sign of the times? Farm security especially for expensive machinery is a consideratio n and there are "Farm Watch" schemes to help.   &lt;br />
