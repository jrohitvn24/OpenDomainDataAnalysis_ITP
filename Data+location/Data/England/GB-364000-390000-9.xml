		<content> Our school dinners are different.We   
 have a cafeteria.This means that you  
 can choose what you eat.We come in at 
 nine o'clock and order our dinner from
 the menu.At dinner time we get our    
 trays,knives and forks and go to the  
 hatch.We get our dinner then choose   
 our pudding and our drinks.Everyday   
 there are lots of cakes to choose     
 from.We pay at the till.Most of the   
 children have free dinners.They get a 
 disc which is 70p for their dinner.We 
 did a survey to find out favourite    
 dinners.Hot Dogs was first,then Fish  
 Fingers,third was Beefburgers.The best
 pudding was Chocolate Eclairs,second  
 was Choc-ices and third was jelly.The 
 favourite drink was Vimto,second was  
 milk shake.Our cook has three helpers 
 in the kitchen.Five dinner ladies look
 after us at dinner time. Some children
 have packed lunches.                  </content>
