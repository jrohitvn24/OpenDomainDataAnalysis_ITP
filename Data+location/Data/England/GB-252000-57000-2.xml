 of the area.The first large housing   
 estates were built about 1960,and some
 are still being built.There are a few 
 older houses on the edge of Colebrook.
   The estate houses are mostly semi-  
 detached.A few are detached.          
   Some of the older houses have been  
 modernized.Some houses have had       
 extensions or garages built.Some      
 houses have had old windows and doors 
 replaced with double glazed,aluminium 
 or plastic units.                     
   Over half of the houses in this area
 have had some kind of extra weather   
 proofing ,like pebble dash,stone or   
 tile cladding or water proof paint.   
   Some houses have solar heating      
 panels fixed on their roof.A couple of
 people have balconies built on,and    
 some houses have burglar alarms as    
 well.                                 </content>
