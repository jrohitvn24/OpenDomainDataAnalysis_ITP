Duke of Kent who likes to visit the    
theatre on special events. Other       
membersf the Royal Family have also    
visited the Orchard. The theare was    
designed to have 1,200 seats but was   
cut down to 912.  There is an orchestra
pit which can be stage level or drop   
down 15 feet, the dressing rooms are   
all the same size but the star of any  
show always has dressing room number   
one.  The fire and burglar alarms are  
situated at the stage door, and the    
lighting control box is where the film 
projectors are kept.  There are two    
bars a snack bar and a confectionery   
kiosk for refreshment.  The theatre    
is named Orchard as it was built on the
site of an orchard.
