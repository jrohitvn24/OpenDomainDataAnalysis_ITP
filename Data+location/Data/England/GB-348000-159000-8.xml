		<content>{  }MANY WILD ANIMALS LIVE IN THIS     
 AREA. I ASKED PEOPLE IN BLAGDON       
 VILLAGE WHAT ANIMALS THEY HAD SEEN IN 
 THE COUNTRYSIDE. SIX OF THEM HAD SEEN 
{FOXES}AND TWELVE HAD SEEN{RABBITS.}THE
 CHILDREN IN CLASS THREE HAD SEEN      
 THIRTEEN SNAKES. SEVEN WERE{ADDERS    
 AND SIX WERE{GRASS SNAKES.}SOME PEOPLE
 HAD SEEN{ROE DEER}IN THE WOODS AND    
 MANY PEOPLE HAD SEEN{GREY SQUIRRELS.} 
 THERE ARE A LOT OF SQUIRRELS AT COMBE 
 LODGE.                                
    I LIKE ALL THESE ANIMALS BUT I LIKE
 THE FOX BEST; IT IS SO GRACEFUL. I    
 DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE HUNTED AND   
 KILLED. FOXES ARE HUNTED WITH HORSES  
 AND HOUNDS. MOST PEOPLE HUNT FOXES    
 BECAUSE THEY LIKE THE SPORT. THEY KILL
 THE FOXES FOR THEIR TAIL. THE TAIL IS 
 CALLED THE BRUSH. I THINK IT IS VERY  
 CRUEL TO KILL FOXES IN THIS WAY.
