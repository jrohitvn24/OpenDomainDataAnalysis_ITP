		<title>01THE AREA AROUND RAMSBOTTOM.</title>
		<content>  The area is 16km.north of Manchester.
 It is a semi rural area rising to     
 approximately 300m.and dominated by   
 Holcombe Hill,on the top of which     
 stands {Peel Tower}a monument to {Sir 
{Robert Peel.}                         
   The{landscape}of the area greatly   
 influences how it is used by man and  
 its economic development.             
   Ramsbottom is the largest settlement
 of the area being situated in the     
 valley of the river Irwell.Smaller    
 settlements are found around          
 Ramsbottom _ Hawkshaw,Holcombe        
 Brook,Summerseat,and Greenmount,all of
 which are now purely residential.     
  There is a large proportion of       
 farmland in the area - especially on  
 the valley sides.                     
  Since the building of the            
 motorway,M66,the area is becoming     
 a{commuter  belt}.                    </content>
