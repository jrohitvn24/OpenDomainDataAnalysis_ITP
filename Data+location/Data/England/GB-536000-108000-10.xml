		<title>10THE BATTLE OF LEWES</title>
		<content> In 1264 {Simon De Montfort}defeated   
{King  Henry III}and his son {Edward } 
 during the {Battle of Lewes}, and took
 both of them prisoner.It changed the  
 ruling of the Country from Royalist to
 Parliamentary.The battle took place on
 the Downs N.W. of the town but there  
 is no evidence of it now,but the maps 
 show that Prince Edward's advance went
 right through where our school now    
 stands, and we play football on the   
 ground just below the castle.A housing
 estate and a large corn field now     
 covers most of the major battle field 
 and many roads in this area are named 
 after people from both sides,such as  
{King Henrys Rd,De Montfort Rd,Prince  
{Edwards Rd,Leicester Rd}and{Simons    
{track.}The Battle site can be seen on 
 an Ordnance Survey map of this area,  
 by the date 1264 and a symbol of      
 crossed swords.BY DAN,JEREMY AND CHRIS</content>
