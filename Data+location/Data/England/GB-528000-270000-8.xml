		<title>08Clifton Farm.Hemingford Grey</title>
		<content> The Clifton farm is situated          
 approximately one mile south west of  
 St. Ives, in the village of Hemingford
 Grey. It comprises 24 hectares of well
 drained soil growing mainly           
 vegetables.                           
 The owner has lived in the village for
 44 years. During that time he has seen
 many changes in his farm and in       
 farming locally. He has had the farm  
 for the last 24 years, the first 14 of
 which he kept pigs. He has seen       
 farming change from mainly manual work
 and the use of horses to today's use  
 of tractors and highly specialised    
 machinery. This farm is not typical of
 farms in this area. Most local farms  
 are arable, growing mainly cereal     
 crops with some dairying. The fields  
 tend to be very large leading to      
 typical flat, open East Anglian       
 landscapes.                           </content>
