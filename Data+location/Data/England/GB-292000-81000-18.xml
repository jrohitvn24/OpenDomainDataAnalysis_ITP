  The Church was founded by St         
 Petherick around 560 when he travelled
 through Devon.The tower which can be  
 seen from the surrounding countryside 
 is 120 feet high.The famous Rod Screen
 is a gift from Bishop Peter Courtney  
 in 1478. Many people visit Kenton just
 to see this.                          
{Lumley Cross- }Given by Lord Mamhead  
 in memory to his sister and kept in   
 Exeter Cathederal.It was stolen and   
 found in a hedge without it's jewels. 
 The silver cross was from then on kept
 in Kenton church.Lord Mamhead had a   
 smaller gold replica made with        
 jewels,which was kept in  his bedroom 
 until he died.It is now kept in the   
 church.
