		<title>17A TYPICAL SUNDAY IN LAINDON</title>
		<content> First thing on a{Sunday }I get up     
 about 9.15am . I go  downstairs and   
 have my breakfast and I watch         
 Television for a little while. My mum 
 is at work but on Sunday my dad       
 doesn't have to go to work so he makes
 breakfast for me and my sister. After 
  that I go upstairs and get           
 washed and dressed. Later I take the  
 dog for a walk with my friend Helen.  
 While I am out, my dad does  the      
 housework and my sister gets dressed. 
 My mum comes home at 11 o'clock. When 
 I come back from my walk I go round   
 and knock for Shellie. We play and    
 then it's time for my dinner. After   
 my dinner Shellie, Natalie and I  play
 out on our skates. I go in about 8    
 o'clock and have my tea. I go to bed  
 at 9 o'clock. I don't like Sunday     
 because I get bored.
