		<title>14The Public Houses</title>
		<content> There are three licensed public       
houses, all offer a variety of meals.  
 The Lamb is the largest and at this   
time,the most popular; attracting a    
varied custom including many of the    
"old" villagers; as opposed to         
"newcomers".                           
 The Red Lion is lively but about to   
suffer a change of landlord.           
 The Crown is seldom as busy as the    
other two.                             
 All the pubs run dart teams, house a  
"one armed bandit" and play recorded   
music; in short they are similar in    
what they have to offer.               
 The start of competition in the form  
of The Wallace Club, which offers cheap
drinks and more floor space is an      
interesting development.
