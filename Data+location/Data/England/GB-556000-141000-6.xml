		<content> The worst problem in the area is that 
of the A26 through Southborough, which 
is badly congested in the morning and  
evening rush hours and at many other   
timesof the day. There is no easy way  
of by-passing this narrow road which   
does carry much heavy lorry traffic as 
well as cars and buses. Pedestrian     
crossings in the shopping area and a   
major T-junction add to the slowing of 
the traffic flow.                      
 Another rush hour snarl-up occurs in  
High Brooms when traffic to or from the
neighbouring industrial estate has to  
pass under the railway on a single     
track road with traffic lights.        
 High Brooms station is on the London  
to Hastings line and has recently been 
lengthened to take the new 12-coach    
electric trains which will shortly be  
running on this line. The section south
of Tonbridge is being electrified.     </content>
