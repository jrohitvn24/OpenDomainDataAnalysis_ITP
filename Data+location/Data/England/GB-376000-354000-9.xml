		<title>09Occupations in Alsager</title>
		<content> There are two main industries in      
 Alsager.They are Twyfords and Radway  
 Green-the ammunitions factory.Both of 
 these companies employ a large number 
 of people.Alsager developed because it
 was convenient for the Potteries and  
 Crewe.This helped the population to   
 grow.A survey carried out in Alsager  
 Comprehensive School showed that      
 pupils parents worked in the          
 Potteries,Crewe and Alsager.The type  
 of employment showed a majority of    
 manual workers with office workers a  
 close second and self employed        
 third.Most people worked in           
 Alsager-201-,second came the people   
 who worked in the Potteries-198-and   
 lastly those who worked in Crewe-95.Of
 the pupils interviewed about 8% of    
 pupils parents worked abroad on       
 occasions.
