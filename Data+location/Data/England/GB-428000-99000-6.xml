		<content> Brockenhurst Park Stables, now known  
 as Church Lane Stables were built in  
 1903 by John Morant, then Lord of the 
 Manor, to satisfy his passion for     
 horse racing. Racehorses continued to 
 be trained here until the late l950s, 
 except that during the l939-45 war    
 evacuees from London were accommodated
 in the bothy.  The last horse of fame 
 trained here was LOVELY COTTAGE who   
 won the Grand National in l947 - to   
 the profit of the villagers ! In the  
 late l950s Brockenhurst  Park estate  
 was sold; from then until 1975 various
 tenants rented the stables as a riding
 school.                               
        The present owners have        
 occupied the premises as a private    
 residence since l975 and use the      
 stables to satisfy their joint hobby  
 of horses and horse drawn vehicles.
