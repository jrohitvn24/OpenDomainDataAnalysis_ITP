		<content>   Fashion is one of those things that 
 is always changing.Our School Uniform 
 is not very fashionable because Bottle
 Green has gone'out'.The most popular  
 colours are Mint,Pink,Blue and other  
 pastel colours.The least fashionable  
 colours are Brown,Dark Green and      
 Orange.Out of School girls like to    
 wear trousers and flowery print tops  
 and boys collarless (Grandad) shirts. 
   Jeans are fashionable for boys and  
 girls as are faded shirts.            
   Most parents like their children to 
 wear sensible shoes for school but we 
 prefer to wear trainers.The best ones 
 are those without laces-they have     
 Velcro fastening.                     
   Girls like to wear slingback and    
 stilleto heeled shoes.                
   On the whole fashion changes from   
 season to season each year.
