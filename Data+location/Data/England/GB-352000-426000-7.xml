		<title>07LIFE IN PENWORTHAM,PRESTON</title>
		<content>   There are lots of different types of
{houses}in Penwortham;detached,semi-   
 detached,terraced,flats,cottages,bunga
 lows and maisonettes.I live in a      
 semi-detached in Spring Gardens.We own
 our own house, but some people rent   
 their houses.Our house is 18 years    
 old.My{Mum and Dad}moved into it when 
 they got married, and the house had   
 just been built.                      
    My Mum goes{shopping}at Hawksberry 
 Drive shopping precinct for bits and  
 pieces we use every day.My Mum does   
 big fortnightly shops at KwikSave.    
   {Entertainment}in this district     
 isn't very good.You must go to Priory 
 High Leisure Centre for tennis,       
 badminton,and gymnastics.The nearest  
 swimming baths are in Preston.There   
 are a few football fields open to the 
 public but they don't have nets.I like
 to go rollerbooting in the streets.   </content>
