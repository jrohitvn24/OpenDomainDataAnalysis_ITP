		<title>18Local History In Norton Area</title>
		<content>   The Hundred House in Norton used to 
 be a court, and the stocks were used  
 to put people in who had done         
 something wrong.  On the side of the  
 stocks there is a whipping post.  The 
 pond was used for ducking ladies who  
 nagged men.  They used to have a pole 
 with a seat strapped to it, and people
 came to watch.  A person ducked the   
 ladies, and they came out wet,        
 spitting dirty water out of their     
 mouths.                               
   Near the stocks there used to be an 
 oak tree, but the roots were growing  
 under the road, so a few years ago    
 they cut it down.  The boys from Apley
 Park School made a seat from the tree 
 stump.                                
   The bus shelter in Norton was opened
 when Queen Elizabeth II was crowned.
