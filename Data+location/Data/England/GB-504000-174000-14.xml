		<content> We visited Swifts Meat Store and were 
 shown around by Mr Carr. The store    
 opens up at 3am. The meat comes from  
 all over the country. The butchers    
 come to choose their meat. There were 
 sides of beef, whole pigs and lambs   
 for sale, as well as bacon, ham and   
 chickens.  It was very cold in there  
 as it is all refrigerated.

 We counted how many people had someone
 in their family working at the        
 airport. It was nearly everyone in the
 school. Our Chairman of Governors,    
 Mr White works for British Airways. He
 came and talked to us. Mr Peel is     
 another of our Governors and he got us
 lots of posters for our project.      
 I expect I will work at the airport   
 one day if I stay in Stanwell. I hope 
 so.                                   </content>
