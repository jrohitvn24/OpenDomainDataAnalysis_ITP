		<content>  The village has a{population }of less
 than 400 in 160 households.Most people
 rely on employment outside the village
 and many commute daily to Nottingham. 
 Farming,the Police College,the larger 
 houses &amp; village services provide most
 local employment.A fifth of villagers 
 are retired and only 50 are under 18. 
 Most village{houses}are large detached
 properties in large gardens.Three     
 grand houses in large grounds surround
 the church.Many of the older cottages 
 &amp; farmhouses have been modernised and 
 extended but some small cottages      
 remain.Post-war development includes a
 small close of council houses,some    
 built for police use but now in       
 private ownership,the four houses of  
 Elm Park &amp; up to 20 individual houses.
 One house is being built at present &amp; 
 five extended.All mains services are  
 available except gas.                 </content>
