		<content> 1     The "Berkeley and Sharpness     
 Gazette" is a typical local newspaper 
 serving a wide area stretching from   
 Cambridge in the North to Thornbury in
 the South.  It is published weekly and
 can, to all intents and purposes be   
 divided into two sections.            
      The first part of each issue     
 deals with all the items of local news
 such as local Council meetings,       
 societies, farming news and local     
 people as well as any National stories
 which have a particular bearing on    
 area served by the newspaper.         
      The rest of the newspaper is     
 devoted to Classified and Business    
 advertisements and numerous other     
 private advertisements.  As with its  
 sister publication, "The Stroud News  
 and Journal", this second section     
 performs an extremely popular and     
 very successful local service.        </content>
