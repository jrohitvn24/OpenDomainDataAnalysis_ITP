		<title>09WHATTON DETENTION CENTRE</title>
		<content> Most of the boys at the detention     
 centre are there for taking and       
 driving away cars, playing truant and 
 mugging old people.The age range is   
 from 14 to 21 years.  When they first 
 get there they sleep in small         
 rooms.  Later they sleep in           
 dormitories of 20 boys. In the        
 mornings the boys work, learning a    
 skill or just doing menial tasks. Then
 in the afternoon the boys can         
 chose what lesson they want to do like
 learning to play the guitar and trade 
 work like brick laying and wood work. 
 The only entertainment they get is    
 television and a Sunday night video.  
 The boys think the food is terrible   
 partly because they have to eat out of
 tin trays.Only the new younger ones   
 try to escape.They do all sorts of    
 sports and their education is just    
 like that of a normal school.         </content>
