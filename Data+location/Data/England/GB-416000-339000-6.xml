		<title>06DAIRY FARMING</title>
		<content>    With dairy farming you have to milk
 the cows in the morning and at night. 
 You put the cows in the ring; the ring
 is somewhere you keep the cows before 
 you milk them. We milk the cows in the
 milking parlour. To milk the cows we  
 put a milk cluster on the teats of the
 cow's udder. When the cows are being  
 milked,they have VICON.               
    Cows can get a disease called      
 mastitis, they get this when the bag  
 is damaged.                           
     In the summer they spend the night
 in the fields, and in the winter they 
 go in the cow sheds. In the summer    
 they eat hay; in the winter they are  
 fed on silage.                        
    We have about sixty-three cows.    
 They take up 30 acres of pasture land.
 They give about 250 gallons of milk   
 each day.
