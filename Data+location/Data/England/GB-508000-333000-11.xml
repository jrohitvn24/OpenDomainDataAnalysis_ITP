		<content> Every year we have a Gala with a fancy
 dress parade through the village.The  
 parade is led by a marching band.The  
 Gala is held to raise funds for       
 charity.This year the money went to   
 the Ethiopian Famine appeal.          
  Christmas is a special time for the  
 school children especially. The school
 is decorated with all the Christmas   
 handwork. The children are very busy  
 preparing the concert for their       
 parents and friends.                  
  At Easter, some of the old customs   
 are still observed like painting and  
 rolling eggs.                         
  An ancient horse fair,held at Stow   
 Green, was continued into the 1940's  
 but died out with the decline of horse
 transport.                            
  Billingborough and Horbling have a   
 Feast Day although the reason for it  
 is now forgotten.                     </content>
