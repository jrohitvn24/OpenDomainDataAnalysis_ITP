<title>21Rector's update</title>

<content>The Revd Bill Blakey became Rector on 13th September 1985 staying until January 2001 and Maj Moor served for many years as his Lay Reader. Over the years the congregation achieved all sorts of things including many repairs to the building. In the late 1980s there was quite a bit of damage to the building caused by strong winds including a building that blew in when the wind gusted over 100mph. We had many lovely harvest festival feasts and rogation tide processions.   &lt;br />
