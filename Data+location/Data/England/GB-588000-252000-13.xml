		<title>13A COCKFIELD FAMILY'S WEEKEND</title>
		<content>My name is Lisa Nickson and I live in  
Windsor Green,Cockfield.On Saturday    
morning I went to the Riding Stables   
fora riding lesson.Mum,Dad and Matthew 
my brother came too.I took my own pony,
Shadow.It was a good lesson with lots  
ofjumping.In the afternoon we all went 
to Thursford in the car. The first     
thing that I did was to play on the    
playthings.Matthew called a rope that  
gave you a swing, a Tarzan rope because
we enjoyed it.Then we went to listen to
an organist.The music was very nice and
had lots of tunes.On Sunday morning my 
dad started to build an extension to   
our house.It was fun because we all had
to help him by moving some blocks and  
bricks and we saw lots of spiders,one  
with an egg sack.In the afternoon we   
went strawberry picking at my friend   
Kate's.We got some lovely big straw-   
berries and some little ones too.      </content>
