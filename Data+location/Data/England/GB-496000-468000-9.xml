		<title>09 Religion in Weaverthorpe</title>
		<content>   Most people in the locality are     
{Church of England}or{Methodists,}at   
 least nominally.                      
   In the village are the{Methodist    
{Chapel}and the{Parish Church}(about   
 100 yards north of the D block).      
  The old galleried chapel was pulled  
 down and the Sunday-school room was   
 extended and offically opened in July 
 1985. There is a weekly service and   
 Junior church on Wednesdays. It is    
 part of the{Sherburn Circuit.}        
  {The Church of St. Andrew's}dates    
 from 1110.{Street}renovated it in     
 1872. People visit from all over      
 England, and the former Dominions.    
 There is a weekly service. The{Vicar  
 lives at Helperthorpe. It is part of  
 the{Buckrose Deanery.}                
   Although both have small regular    
 congregations,  most of the village   
 helps support them financially.       </content>
