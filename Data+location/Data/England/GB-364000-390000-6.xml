		<content> Risley Moss is a nature reserve which 
 covers 80 hectares.The Visitor Centre 
 and the Moss itself were opened in    
 September 1980.Long ago people used to
 work all day at the Moss digging out  
 the peat.Now Risley Moss has trees and
 lots of wildlife.There are hides where
 you can see birds and foxes too.They  
 have a tall wooden tower so that you  
 can look out over the Moss.The Rangers
 have walkie-talkie radios so they can 
 speak to each other.They always weasr 
 green and have a badge on their       
 jumpers.Sometimes they have dirty     
 weekends when they collect rubbish and
 stuff out of the ponds.They come to   
 school and ask us to help.The Rangers 
 cut down trees that have died and     
 plant new ones.They stop weeds from   
 killing the flowers.They look after   
 the wildlife.It's great at Risley Moss
 Lots of visitors come to see the birds</content>
