		<title>02Village Shop</title>
		<content> The owner has been running the shop   
 for nine years.When she started the   
 shop there was only the post          
 office.She says it is very nice       
 running the shop and she enjoys this  
 type of work.The name of the shop is  
 Ye Olde Paper Shoppe."I chose the name
 because I thought it went in character
 with the shop.The building is 200     
 years old but has been renovated,"she 
 said."A shop in the village is        
 different to a town shop because      
 people just pop in for a chat."Some of
 the problems of running a shop she    
 finds are late papers,short stock,    
 awkward customers,shoplifting and     
 paper boys and girls not turning up.  
 The most popular items she sells are  
 sweets,cigarettes and newspapers.The  
 owner thinks that the prices in her   
 shop are about average.The shop is    
 open seven days a week.               </content>
