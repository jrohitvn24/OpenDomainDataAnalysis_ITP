		<content> Community spirit, neighbourliness     
 &amp; friendliness, followed closely by   
 peace &amp; quiet were the main           
 attractions of living in              
 Badingham &amp; Dennington. Other         
 aspects enjoyed were the beauty of the
 countryside &amp; wildlife, the lack of   
 traffic &amp; pollution, privacy, the     
 unhurried way of life, a sense of     
 identity &amp; identifying with village   
 life, country life &amp; people, village  
 activities, the church, "everything", 
 the absence of street lighting,       
 fresh garden produce, gardens,        
 people's individuality, the pub,      
 trustfulness, the relative security   
 for children &amp; the sense of basic     
 values. According to one household the
 fact that "we are country people" was 
 sufficient reason for liking village  
 life.
