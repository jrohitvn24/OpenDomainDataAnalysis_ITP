		<title>02SUGGESTIONS FOR NEW ROMNEY</title>
		<content> I THINK NEW ROMNEY IS A GOOD PLACE TO 
 LIVE IT IS A FRIENDLY COMMUNITY.MOST  
 HOUSES ARE PLACED JUST THE RIGHT      
 DISTANCE FROM THE HIGH STREET.I DO    
 THINK THERE SHOULD BE OAK TREES       
 PLANTED SO THAT LATER GENERATIONS CAN 
 SEE WHAT A LOVELY TOWN IT IS.I THINK  
 THE SHOPS IN NEW ROMNEY ARE JUST RIGHT
 FOR THE COMMUNITY ALTHOUGH SOME ARE A 
 LITTLE EXPENSIVE.HAVING TWO           
 SUPERMARKETS IS A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE   
 ONE IS ALWAYS TRYING TO BEAT THE      
 OTHERS PRICES.I ALSO THINK THERE      
 SHOULD BE MORE TELEPHONE BOXES AND    
 MORE THAN ONE PUBLIC TOILET.THERE     
 SHOULD BE MORE POLICE PATROLS TO      
 PREVENT VANDALISM.WE HAVE ENOUGH      
 HISTORY TO HAVE A BETTER MUSEUM,THERE 
 IS ENOUGH ROOM AND IT WOULD ATTRACT   
 TOURISTS.
