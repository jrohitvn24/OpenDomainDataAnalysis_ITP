		<title>19CHANGING SCENE FARNWORTH</title>
		<content>   When we looked at some Ordinance    
 Survey Maps of the area which had been
 published in the 1950's we were amazed
 at the changes there had been in the  
 last thirty years.                    
   On Longcauseway for example there   
 were a number of cotton and rayon     
 mills.There were the Oak Mills and    
 Pandora Mills on Longcauseway.These   
 mills have long since gone but part of
 Moorfield Mill is still               
 standing.Around Longcauseway there    
 were also many mill reservoirs,in fact
 there was a reservoir between Booth   
 Street and Longcauseway where the     
 present Total Petrol Station is       
 standing.                             
   Off Albert is a very old building   
 which used to be the New Empire       
 Cinema.There are tramlines going      
 into the cinema and we discovered it  
 used to be the tram depot.            </content>
