		<title>17TWIN TOWN: FEIGNES</title>
		<content> Twinning is a linking of two          
 communities of different nationalities
 and producing relationships between   
 different villages in different       
 countries. Keyworth has been twinned  
 with Feignes (pronounced Fain-yee)    
 since 1977. Feignes is a small town in
 northern France near the Belgian      
 border, about one hours drive from    
 Brussels. It is a similar size to     
 Keyworth, with a large market square, 
 overlooked by the Town Hall and the   
 "Salle de Fete" which is used for     
 social gatherings e.g, art exhibitions
 etc. When I went on a visit to Feignes
 we went to a disco with our French    
 friends. We also went shopping to the 
 hypermarket. It is good fun on a      
 French exchange.
