		<content> When the Plague was in London in 1346 
 the cloth was brought here. They      
 found out that it spread              
 the plague.They burnt it and then     
 buried it around the mill. A few years
 later there was a fire and the mill   
 was burnt down and the only thing left
 was the mill stone but that is under  
 water.There are some mill stones      
 dotted around the stables and fields  
 at Paper Mill Farm. In the summer the 
 river is quiet.                       
            THE FARM                   
 Paper Mill Farm is a Stud Farm.Miss   
 Redbart and her father live at the    
 farm with the farm manager. The       
 studding is done at a particular time 
 of year from April to June. They have 
 two Stallions,ten Stud horses and nine
 show jumpers. They have 88 acres of   
 land and it is very quiet.On the farm 
 it is very hard work but fun.         </content>
