		<content> Despite its name{Clifton-on-Teme      
 stands well above the river that gives
 its name to one of Englands most      
 beautiful valleys .Six hundred feet   
 above sea level,Clifton can justly    
 claim to be one of the prettiest      
 villages on the western borders of    
{Worcestershire;}quiet,compact and     
 uncommercialised,it has not           
 surprisingly,attracted many newcomers 
 and its population now stands at      
 around 600.                           
 The main part of the village is a     
{conservation area}and any new building
 is very carefully controlled. If there
 is cause for concern about the future,
 it lies in the distinct possibility   
 that high transport costs and the     
 village's popularity with senior      
 citizens may denude the village       
 of young people.
