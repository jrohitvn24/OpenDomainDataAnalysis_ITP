		<content> HOUSING IN MY VILLAGE                 
                                       
 In Maxey most houses are detached but 
 in Tuckers Nook, (one road), there are
 some bungalows. In my village my      
 favourite house is Abbey House,       
 because it is haunted.                
 On Sundays most people wash their cars
 or clean their windows and do their   
 gardens in our neighborhood.          
 About a month ago my grandma moved    
 house from near Rainbow, (a           
 supermarket in Market Deeping) to     
 Tuckers Nook and my dad swapped her   
 little shed for a big one. A long time
 ago the vicar moved next door to us.  
                                       
 This piece of writing reflects what   
 one eight year old boy considers to be
 the important aspects of housing to   
 him.
