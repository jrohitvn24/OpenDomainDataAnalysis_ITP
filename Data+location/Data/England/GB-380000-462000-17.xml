		<title>17PEOPLE USING SETTLE</title>
		<content> We went into Settle on a Wednesday in 
{June}to find out who was in town and  
 why they were there. In the Autumn and
 the Winter there are not usually many 
 people in town because Wednesday is   
 the day that the shops are closed for 
 the afternoon.{(Half-day closing)     
   There were quite a lot of people    
 about, and we interviewed{29, 14}of   
 them lived in{Settle or Giggleswick.  
{15}of them were from{elsewhere;}from  
 places as far appart as{London}and the
{North of Scotland.}We found out that  
 most people were in the town just to  
{look}at the town and the shops rather 
 than to buy anything in particular.   
   When we asked them what they most   
{liked}about the town many people      
 picked out the market place, or simply
 said{"All of it".
