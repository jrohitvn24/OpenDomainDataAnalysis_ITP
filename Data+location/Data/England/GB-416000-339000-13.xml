		<title>13BEGINNINGS OF OUR SCHOOL</title>
		<content>    The old school was built at a cost 
 of Â£120 in 1841. The land for it was  
 given by Earl Ferrers. There were 45  
 children attending the school in 1844 
 and 55 in 1900.                       
    Some of the lessons were English,  
 arithmetic, geography, history,       
 elementary science, singing, drawing, 
 needlework and gardening. They played 
 sports like football, rouders, cricket
 and shinty.                           
    Inspectors came to see the         
 conditions of the old school and to   
 see the children's work. The vicar    
 came to give scripture lessons, which 
 the children had quite a lot of. The  
 infants did not have a proper teacher.
 They had a pupil teacher instead.     
    The school often closed for        
 illnesses, like whooping cough and    
 measles.
