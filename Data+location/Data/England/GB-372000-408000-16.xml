		<title>16ST. STEPHEN'S CHURCH.</title>
		<content> St. Stephen &amp; All Martyrs Church of   
 England is situated on Radcliffe Road 
 and is commonly known as Lever Bridge 
 Church because of the nearby bridge   
 over the River Tonge.                 
 The building, whose architect was     
 Edmund Sharpe, took over 2 years to   
 complete and was consecrated by the   
 Bishop of Chester in 1845. It is built
 from terra-cotta clay found at        
 Ladyshaw Pit at Little Lever owned by 
 the Fletchers and it was transported  
 by barge along the Manchester_Bolton- 
 Bury Canal. Terra-cotta is a porous   
 material  which is apt to crumble,    
 hence the removal of the spire,and    
 later the 'lantern' by the local      
 steeplejack,Fred Dibnah. The          
 decorative features of the interior of
 the church are all made of terra-cotta
 and the only stone item is the font.  
 The present vicar is Rev.S. Rudkin.   </content>
