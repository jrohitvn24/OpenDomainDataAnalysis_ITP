		<title>10N. Lopham School, 1950's</title>
		<content>      Mr. Potter, father of Michelle   
 who described the village school      
 today, attended the same school       
 approximately 1952-1963.              
                                       
      There were 100 children in North 
 Lopham school then.  Mr. Potter said  
 he liked it sometimes.  The main work 
 was reading, writing and sums.  The   
 sports equipment was skipping ropes   
 and balls.  It was very strict.  The  
 uniform was short trousers and a cap  
 and jacket.                           
                                       
      By the time Mr. Potter went to   
 school, school dinners had started.   
 The games he played were marbles and  
 football.  He had the cane a lot.     
 The cane was used for any little      
 thing.  He says that everything has   
 changed.  He would like school now,   
 not how it used to be.                </content>
