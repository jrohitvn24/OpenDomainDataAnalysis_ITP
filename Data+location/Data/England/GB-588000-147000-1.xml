		<content>    Our area is predominantly rural,   
 the village of Egerton and hamlet of  
 Lenham Heath are surrounded by        
 agricultural land comprising of cereal
 and fruit growing and grazing for     
 sheep and cattle.  There is a small   
 area of deciduous woodland and in     
 Egerton an amenity area.              
   Houses in the village are clustered 
 around the church, shop, primary      
 school and inn and lead out of the    
 village on the main roads.  The area  
 contains many old and restored        
 properties interspersed with post_war 
 housing.  The village is populated    
 largely by families in which at least 
 one member commutes to work; other    
 commuters are our secondary school    
 children.  Public transport has       
 gradually declined, now most families 
 own at least one vehicle.
