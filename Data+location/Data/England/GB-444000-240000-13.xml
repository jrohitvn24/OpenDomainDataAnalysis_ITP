		<title>13Markets in Banbury</title>
		<content>  The Cattle Market is on Tuesdays,    
Wednesdays and Thursdays. The main one 
is on Thursdays. The cattle market is  
at the end of Merton Road, near the    
railway station.                       
  This market is run by Midland Marts  
and is the biggest cattle market in    
Europe. A farmer can not only buy      
animals but also machinery too, like   
tractors.                              
  The farmer brings his livestock into 
market and sells and buys new things.  
  On the main market day the buses go  
to all the little villages like Horley 
and bring the people to Banbury.       
  There is another market on Thursdays 
and Saturdays in the market place near 
the town hall and shopping centre. It  
sells toys, clothes, fruit, vegetables,
books, sweets and all sorts of things.
