		<content>  The present{Carnival}in Sherston     
 started in 1973 as an intended 'one   
 off' fund raising effort for the      
 benefit of the building used as the   
{village hall}.This building was a     
 replacement for the{medieval}tythe    
 barn which was demolished in 1844 to  
 provide a site for the 'National'     
{school}, the Methodists having founded
 their 'British' school a year earlier.
  When no longer needed for the tythes 
 it became the drill hall for the local
 militia and is still known to many    
 older villagers as the 'Rifle Range'. 
  Now the hall is used by many of the  
 village organisations but its upkeep  
 and extension have to be in part      
 covered by what has now become an     
 annual event, inculding street market 
 Carnival parade a multitude of outdoor
{entertainments}and often a dance or a 
 'family' evening.                     </content>
