		<title>08HOLT'S MINI MUSEUM</title>
		<content>   There is an interesting character in
 Holt who has a collection of old and  
 curious things from the village. She  
 started her collection when she       
 renovated her house and found lots of 
 old coins, bottles and little         
 childrens' toys. She decided to keep  
 the things and start a mini-museum. It
 was open to the public from 1975 to   
 1982, but then there wasn't enough    
 room to keep all the exhibits on show.
 Children in the village are still     
 allowed to visit the house, by        
 arrangement though.                   
   When the lady took away part of the 
 wall in her house, she and her husband
 found some wattle and daub plaster and
 also a wall that did not belong to    
 either of the two houses that they    
 were making into one. It even had a   
 window!
