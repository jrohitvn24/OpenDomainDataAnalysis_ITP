		<content> The church was built in  1245 and     
 restored in 1872.It has three bells,  
 one of which is 1500 years old. The   
 congregation of about 50 comes from   
 all over the area _ Saltash, Landrake,
 Hatt, Sheviok, etc. Because it is a   
 country church, it is kept going by   
 this outside congregation.

 little has been changed there.
