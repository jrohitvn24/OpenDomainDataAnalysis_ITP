My family came to live in this area    
because my dad got a new job, and to   
get the job we had to move nearer to   
where he works.                        
      We didn't have to live in        
Buckinghamshire, but when we were      
looking for houses we looked in        
Buckinghamshire, and decided we liked  
the area.                              
     We ended up living in Grendon     
Underwood because we wanted to go and  
look at another house and we passed the
house,that I live at now.We liked the  
house and after a while we bought it.  
   I moved to this area last January   
and it is now the beginning of July and
so I have not lived in this area very  
long.                                  
    My dads job is to check the people 
that build roads.
