		<title>19The Village of Swepstone</title>
		<content> The Norman Church of St. Peter is used
 on Sundays when the Vicar, Mr.        
 Greenwood, comes from Appleby Magna to
 conduct the services. There have not  
 been any recent notable events in the 
 village.  The only local customs are  
 Church festivals, apart from the      
 Vegetable Society Festival, which     
 takes place in August.  The village's 
 principle feature is the Chicken      
 Factory, the only industry in         
 Swepstone.  It employs 22 people, only
 2 being locals. The birds arrive      
 frozen and oven-ready, and are thawed 
 and cooked in steam coolers.  They    
 turn over 25,000 chickens a week. The 
 factory has been going for 8 years,   
 the buildings and land covering       
 approximately 6 acres.  There are no  
 major roadways, waterways or train    
 lines nearby, nor is there any gas.
