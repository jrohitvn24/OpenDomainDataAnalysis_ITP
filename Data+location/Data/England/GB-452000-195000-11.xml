		<title>11HOUSING, CLIFTON HAMPDEN</title>
		<content>   In the  village  itself  most of the
 houses  are  pretty  thatched cottages
 which are  very old and very expensive
 to buy. The  proximity  of  the Culham
 Laboratories  and the situation on the
 River Thames also help to increase the
 prices.  This  means  that  people who
 move here are normally on their second
 or third houses or retiring. There are
 a  few  new  houses  on  the  edge  of
 Clifton Hampden and the  houses at the
 western end of Burcot  have been built
 within the last twenty years.         
   Most of  Clifton Hampden, Burcot and
 the surrounding  land used to be owned
 by the  Gibbs  family. In recent years
 much of the land has been sold. At the
 time when this happened plans were put
 forward  for  a  new  housing  estate.
 These  were  firmly  opposed  by  the 
 present  residents  and  were  finally
 rejected.                             </content>
