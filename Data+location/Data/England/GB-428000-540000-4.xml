		<title>04SHERBURN HOSPITAL</title>
		<content>  This was originally a hospital but   
 was converted into a private old      
 peoples home.It caters for            
 approximately 60 residents.The grounds
 are famed for the annual display of   
 daffodils.There are two main buildings
 for housing the residents.Facilities  
 include self contained flats for some 
 of the residents as well as the normal
 method of looking after the           
 elderly.Trained nurses are available  
 as well as many other workers both    
 paid and voluntary.The person in      
 charge is called the master and he has
 his own detached accomodation within  
 the grounds.There is also a chapel in 
 front of the masters house.Another    
 prominent feature of the building is  
 the beautiful gatehouse.
