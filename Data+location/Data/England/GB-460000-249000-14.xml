		<content>The role of the horse has changed      
completly since the arrival of motor   
veicles. In a rural place such as      
Blakesley the horse played a major     
part both on the farm and as a method  
of transport.Nowadays horses are kept  
mainly for pleasure.Blakesley is the   
heart land of the Grafton Hunt and each
season the Opening Meet is held on the 
village green,usually on the first     
Tuesday in November.It is a splendid   
sight, horses and riders vying with    
each other to see who can be the       
smartest.As well as hunters exercising 
through the village, and the ordinary  
much loved children's ponies, there are
some very successful show horses,ponies
and show jumpers all living and working
in and around the village.Many horses  
from the village compete successfully  
in the local show,which is to a very   
high standard.                         </content>
