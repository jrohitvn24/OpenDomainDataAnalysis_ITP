		<content>    As a result of our survey, it was  
 interesting to note that the areas    
 population was fairly static with only
 10% of families interviewed expected  
 to move within the next five years.   
   Some 40% of the sample were from    
 outside the area, notably 28% from the
 south of England. This was largely    
 occasioned by the change of employment
 patterns in Sheffield with the decline
 in steel making and heavy engineering,
 there has been an influx of people    
 employed by the{Midland Bank}, which  
 recently moved its head office to     
 Sheffield and by the{Manpower Services
{Commision}which also recently moved   
 into the city. There was very little  
 evidence of adult un-employment and   
 the majority of the sample questions  
 were in professional and managerial   
 posts with a significant minority of  
 self-employed businessmen.            </content>
