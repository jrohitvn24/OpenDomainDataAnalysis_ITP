		<title>08Todwick - Bacon Factory</title>
		<content> At the{factory}on Manor Drive they    
 kill pigs and make{meat products}such 
 as bacon, pork and sausages. There are
 190 people who work there.            
 Eighty per cent of the pigs are       
 brought from the port of{Hull}and they
 kill 1800 - 2000 pigs a week. The pigs
 are about 20-24 weeks old when they   
 arrive at the factory. The meat is    
 sold to big stores like British Home  
 Stores and Sainsbury's.               
 Most of the workers have to get up    
 very early because work starts at     
 7.00am.The{working day}lasts until    
 4.30pm but the managers work until    
 about 6.30pm.                         
 The company started in 1969 but       
 some buildings were built many years  
 before, when there was a farm on the  
 site.                                 
                                       
                                       </content>
