		<title>17Holiday Habits in N.St Ives.</title>
		<content>  We have been asking questions about  
 holidays .Hunstanton is a very popular
 place for holidays in this area.That  
 is because it is near , and it is     
 cheap and it is a very nice place .   
   Most people go on a selfcatering    
 holiday so they do everything         
 themselves.                           
   Most people stay in Britain for     
 their holidays,though some people go  
 abroad.The most popular places abroad 
 are France and Spain.France is popular
 because it is relatively  close.      
  Hunstanton is a very pleasant sea    
 side resort.It can be quite warm in   
 the summer.There is a sandy beach,and 
 a fair and amusements.In the town you 
 can buy most things.Many people from  
 our area go to stay in caravans or    
 chalets.They find that then they can  
 please themselves,rather than be told 
 what to do.                           </content>
