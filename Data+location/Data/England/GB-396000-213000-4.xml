		<title>04Rocks for drystone walling.</title>
		<content> miles of dry stone walls. The         
 traditional method of building these  
 walls dates back at least 4000        
 years.First a shallow trench is dug   
 about 60cm.wide and only 12cm.deep    
 because the top strata of understone  
 is very near the surface.2 large      
 stones are placed in the bottom then 3
 smaller stones on top sloping out so  
 that if water got in it would run out.
 The wall continues upward in courses  
 of three with an occasional through-  
 stone or"jumper"for strength to about 
 70cm.On top flat stones are laid up-  
 right called"toppers"or"shuckers".It  
 is not a quick process - a skilled    
 waller could lay a yard in a day the  
 walls following the lie of the land.He
 used a stone axe to trim the stone to 
 shape and a boy helped to fill the    
 gaps with chips.Our characteristic    
 walls continue to build in this way.  </content>
