		<title>08TAWSTOCK CHURCH IMPRESSIONS</title>
		<content>        {MY FIRST IMPRESSIONS          
         {OF TAWSTOCK CHURCH           
                                       
 My first impressions of Tawstock      
 church is that when I walked in and   
 looked at the inside of the church ,it
 reminded me of a small Cathedral. It  
 is for that reason it is known as the 
 little Cathedral of North Devon. The  
 church is dark but spacious.I like the
 way the church is set out, because the
 South Transept is devoted to the      
 Bouchier Wrey family.                 
   In St. Peter's Church Tawstock,     
 there is so much worth preserving.The 
 responsibility for passing on our     
 heritage to the next generation rests 
 on the Church and its parishioners.
