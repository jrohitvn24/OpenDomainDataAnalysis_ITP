		<content>   In the village are three nurseries, 
 a service station ,a building         
 contractors ,a public house ,a poultry
 farm ,a hatchery and various other    
 farms.                                
   The poultry farm and Ross hatchery  
 are the largest local employers.The   
 Ross hatchery employs fifteen         
 workers.At the poultry farm all the   
 chickens are kept for eggs which are  
 sent to the hatchery.Here the eggs are
 incubated band hatched.Twenty thousand
 eggs are hatched per week,the chicks  
 are then sent all over the country.New
 born chicks do not stay at the        
 hatchery for more than one day.Some of
 the chicks are used for laying whilst 
 others are reared for meat.Ross chicks
 may end up as Sun Valley chickens or  
 chicken McNuggets at McDonalds.
