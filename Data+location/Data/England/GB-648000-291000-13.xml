		<title>13LOCAL OPINION</title>
		<content>Residents of Oulton Broad are          
satisfied with the standards of local  
education.They are also satisfied with 
the recreation facilites and the number
of post boxes and public telephones.The
number of public houses,cafes and      
restaurants is good, for the size of   
Oulton Broad, sports and recreation    
facilites are well catered for in all  
age groups, and the church and religion
were described as "not snooty".        
The majority of people considered the  
broads and surrounding area very good  
for tourism.                           
 Housing and the buliding of new homes 
ws not considered to be sufficient.Most
people were happy with the local       
policing and health service,and the    
local public transport, road and rail. 
The amount of both indoor and outdoor  
entertainment is good and varied.
