		<title>17 SMALL FARMING</title>
		<content> My Dad was born in Ireland and came to
this country to work in Denham and     
later Chesham.He was attracted by the  
trees,fields and hills.The farm is20.25
acres.As he has only just started to   
farm 10acres are laid to hay.Animals   
on the farm include a donkey,beef      
cattle,heifers(2 of which we hope to   
put in calf).We use the milk for       
domestic use and to feed the calves.   
We also have some poultry .In the      
future it is hoped that some pigs and  
sheep can be purchased.Some of the land
has been fenced off to grow vegetables.
The goods are marketed in a 30 mile    
radius around Slough,Thame,Reading,    
Aylesbury.As the farm is small my Dad  
has another job.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
