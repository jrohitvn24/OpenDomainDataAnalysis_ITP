 I get up for school at 8 o'clock and  
 arrive there at about quater to 9.    
 When we have gone in and called the   
 dimner register, we go down to        
 assembly. I like it best when another 
 class takes this. after assembly we   
 usally do Peak Maths. That might be   
 number work, measuring,mgraphs or     
 dealing with shapes. After playtime we
 usally do some sort of english. I like
 writing stories best, and listening to
 other people's. Then we have some     
 story and go to dinner. I stay for    
 school dinners. After dinner_play we  
 usually do reading for a bit, then    
 some topic, p.e. or art. I like doing 
 craft on Thursday best; we make things
 with wood, material or paper mache. I 
 like P.E. too, especially when we play
 football.
