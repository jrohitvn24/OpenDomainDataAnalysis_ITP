 They are fairly big strips and there  
 are about 100 altogether. My grandad  
 rents two allotments. Like most other 
 people, he grows fruit and vegetables 
 for the family. He has an Anderson    
 air-raid shelter (left over from World
 War Two) which he uses as a shed. He  
 keeps his gardening tools and some    
 food and drink in it. He needs the    
 food and drink as he is sometimes     
 there all day. It is quite warm and   
 cosy inside the shelter. You will find
 that it is mostly the older people    
 that rent allotments, which they enjoy
 and take great pride in.
