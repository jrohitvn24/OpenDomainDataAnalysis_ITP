 Local government takes the form of a  
 Parish Council consisting of members  
 elected by the village. They and the  
 Harrogate District Council are        
 responsible for local amenities.      
 In addition to the normal services    
 such as road repairs,street           
 lighting and refuse collection they   
 provide special services to the       
 village such as clearing out the beck 
 and keeping the grass cut on its      
 banks.                                
 A mobile library visits the village on
 Wednesdays.
