		<title>01SCHOOL BAND CONCERT</title>
		<content> AT THE BAND CONCERT IT STARTED VERY   
 QUIETLY UNTIL THE HEADMASTER STARTED  
 TO SPEAK.HE SAID HELLO AND THE USUAL  
 THINGS. HE THEN INTRODUCED THE FIRST  
 PIECE, THE BAND STARTED TO PLAY "LET  
 IT BE" THEN THE THEME FROM "DYNASTY"  
 AND FINALLY THE THEME FROM "THE A     
 TEAM".THERE WAS LOTS OF MUSIC PLAYED  
 OR SUNG BY MANY DIFFERENT GROUPS OF   
 PEOPLE SUCH AS THE BAND, THE JUNIOR   
 BAND,TWO DIFFERENT CHOIRS, A THIRD    
 YEAR CLASS EFFORT, SOLOS AND A MUSICAL
 PLAY WHICH WAS VERY FUNNY.ONE OF THE  
 HIGHLIGHTS OF THE EVENING WAS WHEN    
 THE JUNIOR BAND WENT   WRONG AND      
 EVERYONE LAUGHED. WE CARRIED ON.
