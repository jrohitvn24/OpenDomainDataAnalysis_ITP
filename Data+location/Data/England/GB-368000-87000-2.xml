		<content>   Farming here has changed even within
 the last 50 yrs. Before the 1940's the
 land was light and only suitable for  
 sheep, but developments, spurred on by
 the war, led to artificial fertilizers
 allowing cereal crops to grow and     
 dairy cattle to be raised.            
   There are 4 farms in the area:-     
{Whitcombe Farm, Higher Came Farm,}and 
{Came Home Farm}each of about 1000     
 acres, and{Herringston Farm and Dairy}
 of about 500. All have arable land but
 whereas Whitcombe Farm has a flock of 
 sheep, the others have dairy cattle.  
 The farms produce most of their winter
 cattle feed - hay, silage and kale.   
 Crops grown include cereals - wheat,  
 barley, and oats with root crops such 
 as potatoes. Increasingly rape, a high
 yielding crop for oil, is grown. As   
 farming becomes yet more mechanized,  
 the manpower continues to be reduced. </content>
