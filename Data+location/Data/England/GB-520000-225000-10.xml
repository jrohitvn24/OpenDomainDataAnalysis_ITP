 the main road. Behind the church there
 are some houses and it is near a      
 railway line.The church is near       
{Wymondley Bury.}A small lane leads up 
 to the church gate. There is a big    
 gate and by that there is a small     
 gate called a{kissing gate.}From the  
 gate to the church there is a small   
 gravel path with a few grave stones on
 each side. A few families from the    
 Symonds Green neighbourhood attend the
 church.                               
{Wymondley Baptist Chapel.}This is a   
 small chapel on the Hitchin Road in   
 the village. Although it does not have
 a paid minister it is well attended.
