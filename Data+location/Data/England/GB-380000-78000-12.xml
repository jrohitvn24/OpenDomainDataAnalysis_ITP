		<content>    The first Carnival,to be held so   
 some of the villagers say for nearly  
 50 years,took place on June 30th 1985.
    The Procession,comprising 9 floats 
 began at the School,passed through    
 West Lulworth and down to the field   
 near the Cove, in front of the Coast_ 
 guard Cottages.Here there were several
 stalls and sideshows that included;   
 skittles,a greasy pole and the roast_ 
 of a pig.                             
    During the afternoon there were two
 excellent displays.The first was by   
 the Christchurch Youth Marching Band  
 and the second,by the Puddletown      
 Majorettes.                           
    The Carnival Queen was Miss Sarah  
 Hallett and her attendant Princesses  
 were Karen Firmstone,Laura Symes and  
 Kelly Waters.Their float was decorated
 with beautiful roses.They also had the
 hard task of judging the Fancy Dress. </content>
