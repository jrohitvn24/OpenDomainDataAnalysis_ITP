		<title>20Old Burham</title>
		<content>   Near the River Medway stands St.    
 Mary's Church Burham.It was originally
 built by the Normans and held by the  
 Knights Hospitalers until the         
 Dissolution.As the newer houses were  
 built further away from the river in  
 the nineteenth century, the church was
 closed.After a long period of disuse  
 the Church was re-hallowed on 16th    
 September 1965 by the Bishop of       
 Rochester.                            
   Nearby are the derelict buildings of
 Burham Cement Works. During the middle
 of the nineteenth century the village 
 of Burham had grown rapidly as the    
 cement industry flourished.By the end 
 of the century Burham Works were      
 facing difficulties, closing down in  
 1908 but re-opening soon after. The   
 Works closed in 1930 but continued to 
 quarry &amp; produce clinker for other    
 cement factories in the area.         </content>
