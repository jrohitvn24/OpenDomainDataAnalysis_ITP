		<content> Nowadays many of the common species of
 wildlife are becoming rare. This is   
 often because man is spoiling the     
 countryside by using chemicals in     
 farming, draining swamp land, cutting 
 doen hedges and woodlands,and building
 without thought for the future.       
 Our school is in a very lovely setting
 and we are lucky. We do our best to   
 look after the environment. We have a 
 pond in which we have put tadpoles so 
 that they can grow into frogs and     
 newts in safety. We put out food for  
 the birds in the winter so that they  
 will survive the hard weather.        
 We have a nursery in which we plant   
 seeds. Later, when they have grown    
 into young trees, we will plant them  
 out in the woods.
