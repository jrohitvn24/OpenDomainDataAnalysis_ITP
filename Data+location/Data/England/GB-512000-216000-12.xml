		<title>12The Kimpton Home's Animals</title>
		<content>{A Typical Day:}10 a.m. The feeding of 
 the animals takes about an hour. The  
 staff clean the single kennels while  
 the dogs take it in turns to run in   
 the outside runs and get their        
 exercise.                             
{Dogs:}80-100 dogs pass through the    
 home in any one month but the actual  
 number on any one day may vary        
 considerably.                         
{Strays:}People who pick up a stray    
 may take it to a police station, where
 it is kept for a day. If not claimed  
 within that time, it may be taken to  
 the Blue Cross Kennels.               
{Homeless Dogs:}These are the ones that
 have obviously been ill treated or    
 abandoned.                            
{The Welfare Category:}These animals   
 are looked after for a short time     
 while their owners are ill, in prison 
 or have died.                         </content>
