		<title>05Southmoor Bypass</title>
		<content>In view of many accidents that have    
occured on the main A420 Oxford to     
Swindon road in Southmoor it is        
proposed to build a bypass.There are   
two alternative routes,one running to  
the south of southmoor and the favoured
route to the north.This latter route   
would cut across country between       
Southmoor and Longworth.The Drayton    
road and Beggars Lane will both become 
no through roads and the Parish of     
Longworth will effectively be split in 
half.To get to Southmoor it will then  
be necessary to go up Pine Woods road  
and then along the old road.           
Considerable opposition to this road   
has been expressed and there is to be a
public enquiry to decide which would be
the best route.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
