		<content>   In our class of 24 pupils there were
 only 7 pupils whose parents worked in 
 the High Ongar Village area.14 parents
 worked in a 10 mile radius,only 1     
 commuted to London and 2 fathers had  
 jobs that took them abroad.13 parents 
 have work which means they travel.Of  
 the 24 families in the class,18       
 fathers and 12 mothers work outside   
 the home.The type of employment was   
 varied with mothers working mainly in 
 catering,domestic and office work.    
 Fathers were either self              
 employed,drivers or salesmen.Only 1   
 father worked on a farm (parttime).
