		<title>10SPARE TIME IN DIGSWELL</title>
		<content> Daddy spends his spare time writing to
 royal people in France, Spain and     
 places like that.  He does it because 
 he likes writing.  Mummy spends hers  
 reading a magazine and putting her    
 foot up because it still hurts after  
 her car accident.  I spend mine       
 dancing or watching TV as its nice to 
 do different things from schoolwork   
 for a change.{Katie Cooke(9)}         
 Mummy spends her time tidying up the  
 house as she works as secretary at my 
 school.  Daddy reads the paper and    
 watches TV.  When you ask him a       
 question, over and over again, he says
 "Pardon?" after a long time - so you  
 have to tell him again.  My sister and
 I play badminton, squash, tennis,     
 swimming, ice-skating and ballet.{
