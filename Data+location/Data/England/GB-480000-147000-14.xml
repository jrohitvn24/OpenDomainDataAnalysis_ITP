 to Farnham,_Crondall Lane.The whole   
 area called Clare Park was built in   
 George 2nd's time and since then has  
 become a listed building.The main     
 building, which is now an active      
 Elderly Housing Association,has a     
 history of being a school for many    
 years, right up to the early 60's.In  
 the 60's it was made into what it is  
 today.                                
   In 1981,on the grounds of this      
 building, a hospital was built.A      
 private hospital with super           
 facilities, bedroom with ensuite
