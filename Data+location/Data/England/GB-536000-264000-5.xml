		<title>05FARMING AROUND LONGSTANTON</title>
		<content> Almost all our area is under          
 cultivation. The farms are primarily  
 arable, and are held at present by ten
 farmers. Some of the farms employ only
 one man: we estimate that the total   
 manpower for the whole area does not  
 exceed twenty.                        
 The farmer we interviewed at Home Farm
 is atypical for the area in that he   
 has a dairy herd. Thus one third of   
 his land is under grass. The remainder
 grows crops usual for the district:   
 wheat, barley and sweetcorn. Like the 
 other crop commonly grown here -      
 oil-seed rape - this is destined for  
 cattle-feed.                          
 One farm in our area - Noon Folly -   
 is now used by the National Institute 
 of Agricultural Botany. They are      
 running trials of potatoes, brassicas 
 and cereals, including the promising  
 new wheat/rye cross, triticale.       </content>
