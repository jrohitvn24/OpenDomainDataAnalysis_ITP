 was originally a monastry has about   
 three hundred acres of farmland but   
 has recently established a kennels and
 a{riding}school.The school has 19     
 ponies which are used for tuition for 
 novice riders and a menage for        
 jumping practice.The many tracks and  
 fields in the area are used for       
 hacking.The riding school has staged a
 number of gymkhanas in recent         
 years.Altogether Ketton Hall provides 
 several employment opportunities for  
 the area.
