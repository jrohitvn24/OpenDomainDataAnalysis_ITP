		<title>06WATER SUPPLY</title>
		<content> Youlgrave water supply is one of the  
 best in the country. The village gets 
 its water from Blakeley Wood and      
 Harthill springs. The water comes from
 gritstone and tastes nice when drawn  
 from the tap. Youlgrave should never  
 be without water unless the springs   
 dry up which is very unlikely. In the 
 centre of the village is the Fountain 
 or Conduit Head. This is where water  
 was first piped from the spring to the
 village in 1829. 5 taps were connected
 to parts of the village and this is   
 where well dressings are held to thank
 God for our water supply. There is a  
 water works committee and each house  
 pays a rate (currently Â£33 p.a.)      
 towards the cost of new pipes and     
 repairs. New plastic pipes are being  
 laid this year. A small amount of     
 chlorine is added to the water.
