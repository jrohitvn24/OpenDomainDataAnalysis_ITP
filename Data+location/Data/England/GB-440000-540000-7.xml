		<content>{Horden Colliery}will be closing down  
 just before Christmas. The men who are
 made redundant will have a choice of  
 going to{Wearmouth Colliery}or        
{Easington Colliery.}Or they might     
 choose instead to take their          
 redundancy money.                     
 Some men will go to{South Africa}to   
 work in the gold mines because people 
 from South Africa came over and talked
 to the men about working in the gold  
 mines.                                
 When the miners have been made        
 redundant they might like to do brick_
 laying, go into the Army, the Royal   
 Navy, or the Air Force. Some of the   
 men will just find a pastime like     
 gardening or working on their cars if 
 they have one.                        
 They might even take a walk out with  
 the dog!
