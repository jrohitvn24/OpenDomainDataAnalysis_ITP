		<title>10SOME LOCAL ACTIVITIES</title>
		<content> We carried out a survey of the        
 activities that the children in 4R did
 after school.                         
 Among the most popular were attendance
 at the local{Guides and Scouts groups.
 They meet once a week, and            
 occasionally , in the summer time     
 there are camping week-ends.          
 Other children went to the local      
{Sports centre}- particularly during   
 the holidays , when they have special 
 sessions of squash; badminton;        
 football; and trampolining.           
 A lot of children also went to the    
 local{swimming pool; went to judo;    
{horse-riding; read books from the     
{local library; gymnastics club;       
{and clubs associated with the local   
{churches.                             
 Quite a few boys played for local     
{Abbey Youth Football teams.
