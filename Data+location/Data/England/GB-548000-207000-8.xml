		<title>08THATCHING AT THRESHERS FARM</title>
		<content> THRESHERS FARM:{498094.}is having its 
 barn roof re-thatched this year-see   
 photo. The thatcher &amp; his son come    
 from the small town of Hockley-S.E.   
 Essex. The family have thatched since 
 1850-this is the 4th-5th generation   
 The re-covering will take some 4 weeks
 to complete and will cost around Â£3000
 The wheat straw is grown at Newton    
 near Hockley. The sequence of work is 
 to first strip off the wire -mesh ;   
 protection from high winds &amp; birds.   
 The new straw is hosed with water to  
 render it flexible. Heads &amp; tails are 
 mixed.The straw is                    
 'yealmed',straightened &amp; laid &amp;       
 pressed into a thatchers 'dog': a Y-  
 shaped branch one metre long &amp;        
 sharpened at the base so as to be     
 stuck into the old thatch whilst the  
 new straw is lifted out &amp;laid,        
 starting at the eaves &amp; working       </content>
