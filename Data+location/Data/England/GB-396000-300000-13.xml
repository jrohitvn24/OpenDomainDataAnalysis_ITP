		<title>13Land usage around Pool Hayes</title>
		<content> We walked along the canal where we saw
 a grey signet.The first bridge we saw 
 was Perry Hall bridge which is about  
 40 years old.Then we went down Wyrley 
 Road and I was surprised to see how   
 neglected the canal was.There are not 
 many facilities for young people like 
 myself.There was a playground for     
 children but there was only a couple  
 of swings,a slide and a climbing frame
 which did not look very safe.         
    I think that there are too many    
 houses on the estate and that some of 
 the land should have been used for    
 shops,a youth club or even just an    
 open area where children could play in
 safety.Pool Hayes Community School is 
 also on the estate,this is the school 
 which I shall be going to eventually.
