		<title>16Questionnaire _Lees</title>
		<content>   We went out into Lees vIllage and   
 asked people what they thought about  
 Religion in 1985                      
   We split into groups of two or three
 and we stood outside shops and post   
 offices around Lees.                  
  There were  one hundred people in our
 sample and twenty three children took 
 part in asking the questions.         
  It took us about an hour and when we 
 got back to school we marked up the   
 results on a chart.
