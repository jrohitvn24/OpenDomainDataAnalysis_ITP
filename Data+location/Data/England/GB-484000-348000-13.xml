		<title>13BUILDINGS IN CLAYPOLE</title>
		<content>       There is a large and beautiful  
 church at Claypole dedicated to St.   
 Peter. Money is presently being raised
 to restore various parts of it.       
 Heating has recently been installed,  
 a welcome innovation as the church is 
 used for weekly services. There is a  
 churchyard, which is still in use,    
 adjacent to the church. The rector,   
 Reverend David Ensor, lives in the    
 village and serves four parishes      
 altogether.                           
       Further down the main street is 
 the Methodist Chapel and the village  
 hall run by a resident caretaker.     
 There is a post office, which also    
 serves neighbouring villages, two     
 butcher's shops, a general store and  
 a greengrocer's. Along the main street
 are two public houses both fully      
 licensed.                             
                                       </content>
