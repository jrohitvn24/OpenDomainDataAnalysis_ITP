		<title>10Bicycle Riding</title>
		<content>   I go{biking}with my friends. Maybe  
 we will go up Pillbridge Lane where   
 there are two dens that we can play   
 in. On the{bridge}there is a little   
{ramp}to race over and when it has     
 rained there may be some{skid patches 
 for us to skid on. Behind the Jet     
 garage there is a{scramble course}with
 sharp bends and a ramp ,a seasaw and  
 three steep hills.The problem there is
 to stay on your bike!                 
   At school we take a{cycling         
{proficiency test.}We have to learn the
{Highway Code}for a written test and   
 then we must cycle around the village 
 while the examiners are watching us.It
 is good when you pass because you feel
 safer riding your bike on the busy    
 roads;but I still like to come off the
 roads and play stunts with my friends!
