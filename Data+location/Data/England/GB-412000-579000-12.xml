		<title>12LAW AND ORDER IN WHALTON</title>
		<content> There are no courts in the area and no
 police office or policeman based in   
 this survey block. The area is served 
 by police from Northumbria Police     
 Authority based in the nearby towns of
 Morpeth and Ponteland and also a local
 officer in Belsay. The local          
 Magistrates and County Courts are     
 based in Morpeth and the higher Courts
 in Newcastle upon Tyne. Crime is a    
 problem as in other country areas.    
 Burglaries are increasingly common    
 because of ease of transport for      
 criminals and the isolation of many   
 dwellings. As well as private houses  
 the church had lead worth Â£1,500      
 stolen from its roof within 10 days   
 of completion of repairs costing      
 Â£55,000. The school and public house  
 have also been burgled several times. 
 Other forms of crime save for motoring
 offences occur only rarely.           </content>
