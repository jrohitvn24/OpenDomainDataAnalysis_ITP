		<title>06Living in a Portakabin(1)</title>
		<content>  A{portakabin}is a small cabin you    
 live in when your council{house}is    
 being{modernised.}They come on the    
 back of a lorry and are put into your 
 front garden by a crane.              
  The electricity in the house is      
 connected to the portakabin, as is the
 water. There are{two}rooms. There is a
 built in electric fire and in the     
 kitchen there is a small cooker and a 
 sink. A T.V. is provided but there is 
 no bath or toilet, so you have to have
 a bath somewhere else and use the     
 toilet in the house. Two people can   
 sleep in the portakabin and the rest  
 of the family must sleep in the house.
 Any furniture needed is taken from the
 house.                                
  It is{not comfortable,}but when the  
 house is completed it all seems       
 worthwhile.}
