		<title>18Transport and Travel(Cont.)</title>
		<content> one-car, and in many cases,two car    
 families. For most people, a car is   
 not a convenience, but a neccessity.  
        It would seem to be a fact,not 
 merely a convention, that the standard
 of living could not be maintained     
 without some form of personal         
 transport, and as the{family}is the   
 accepted unit, a car is the most      
 important form of transport. It is    
 needed for getting to work, for       
 shopping, for pleasure, and (the most 
 important consideration appears to be 
 this) for transporting teenage        
 offspring to meetings,                
 friends,parties,out of school         
 activities etc.
