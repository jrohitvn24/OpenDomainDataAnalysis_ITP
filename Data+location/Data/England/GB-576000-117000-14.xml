 Whatlington is a dispersed village    
 settlement of predominantly old       
 houses. The 20th. century has seen    
 some very slight infill.              
                                       
 Sedlescombe has spread from its core  
 around the Village Green, north along 
 the A229, and East along Brede Lane.  
 Two private estates provide expensive 
 retirement homes, and a third, larger 
 family dwellings.                     
                                       
 A council estate exists to the East of
 the village and some families are     
 starting to buy their properties.     
 Modern houses are mainly of local red 
 brick, and a few are tile hung and    
 some are weather-boarded.
