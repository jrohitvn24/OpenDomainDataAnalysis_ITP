		<content> Sandstone and bricks are the materials
 used in the homes of the village. But 
 some of the older cottages, still have
 inner walls of a clay-daubing mixture.
 Large slates roof the older houses but
 tiles the more modern buildings. The  
 sandstone would have come from a      
 quarry some miles west of the village.
                                       
 A local building firm is often        
 involved with the construction of new 
 homes and the repairing of existing   
 buildings. Until recently there was   
 a joiner living here who was also     
 involved in much of the local work,   
 but he recently retired and left the  
 area.
