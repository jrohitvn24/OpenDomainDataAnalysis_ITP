		<title>18OLD BUILDINGS OF WHITKIRK</title>
		<content> Although now a suburb of Leeds,       
{Whitkirk in 1985}still has plenty of  
 evidence of{its village past.}Apart   
 from the church (see page 15) there   
 are{several old houses}including the  
{Manor House.}This still shows its     
 stone mullion windows, and the old    
 stable block can be seen across the   
 road.                                 
{The terrace of houses opposite the    
{church}include the{old brewery}from   
 which the beer would be carried across
 the main road to the{village pub      
{"The Brown Cow".}Several of these     
 houses display a small cross of the   
{Knights Templar,}who previously owned 
 much of the village.                  
{"The Brown Cow"}gets its name from the
 cattle market which used to be housed 
 in a round brick building just to the 
 rear. This building is now a          
 supermarket.                          </content>
