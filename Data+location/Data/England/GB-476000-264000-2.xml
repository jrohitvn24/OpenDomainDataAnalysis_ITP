place.It culminates on Festival        
Saturday when there are processions    
and shows, displays by the Morris      
Men who draw the May Queen around      
the streets in her May Cart,also       
stalls and side shows. The May Bower   
competition is held on a Saturday      
morning.Many children enter and it     
is judged by the May Queen.Every       
body gets a prize and the winner
