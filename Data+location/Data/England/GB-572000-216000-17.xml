		<title>17A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> It was a big day in my life - it was  
 our county show. I woke up at 8       
 o'clock and went to the bathroom to   
 have a wash and get dressed. I had my 
 breakfast of egg and bacon . I walked 
 to the showground and gave the man on 
 the gate my ticket. With my Father and
 his Marshal tractor I helped to pull  
 some buses out of the mud in the car  
 park. I walked to my traction engine  
 and got it going. By now it was time  
 for my mum to get lunch for the 50    
 people involved with the traction     
 engines. For lunch I had four         
 beefburgers and a cup of tea. After   
 that I walked round the fairground and
 won a goldfish on the darts game. By  
 then it was time to go. I covered the 
 engine up and walked home. For dinner 
 I had roast beef, Yorkshire pudding,  
 roast potatoes, carrots,peas and      
 cabbage.I went to bed at 9 o'clock.   </content>
