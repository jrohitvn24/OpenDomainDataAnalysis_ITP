 The GLC Tip is situated in Upminster  
 in Gerpins Lane.  The refuse is sorted
 out into different containers:        
 cardboard, paper, metals, rags, glass,
 oil and garden refuse.  The tip can   
 recycle: metal, rags, paper,          
 cardboard, oil, glass, carpet and in  
 future they are planning to recycle   
 timber, tin and plastic.  Toxic waste 
 is taken by an inspector in a lorry,  
 it's taken to a secret site and       
 buried.  It takes 500-1000 years to   
 rot down.  The tip was first used in  
 l972 or earlier, it was modernized in 
 March l984.  The most cars come on    
 Sunday, the record is 3000 plus.  The 
 most lorries come Saturday morning.   
 Normal refuse goes to Ockendon to be  
 recycled, bottles go to Harlow.       
                                       
 by pupils from BRANFIL SCHOOL.        </content>
