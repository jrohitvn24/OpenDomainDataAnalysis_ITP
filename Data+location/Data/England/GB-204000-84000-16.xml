   "Going to hospital" by Ben Worden.  
                                       
      I went  to  Truro  hospital      
 when  I  broke  my  collar bone .     
 I  broke    my  collar bone because   
 the boys were   giving  me the        
 bumps and I  fell on my back. My      
 auntie took me to the doctor. He told 
 her that I had to go to Truro Hospital
 thirty miles away.                    
      When I got there, there was a    
 long queue. When it was my turn they  
 gave me an X-ray. My arm was put in a 
 sling.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
