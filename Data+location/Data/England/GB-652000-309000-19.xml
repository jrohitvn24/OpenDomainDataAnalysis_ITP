		<content> NEWTOWN METHODIST CHURCH,GT.YARMOUTH  
   The church is quite big, with a     
 large round clock(belonging to the    
 corporation) hanging over the pavement
 &amp; dominating the front.               
   Inside the Church is a hand-made    
 font, a tribute to a Mrs.Doris Adams  
 who died Nov.1969. About 25 normally  
 attend, but the numbers have decreased
 in the last two years. Most attend in 
 family groups.                        
   Mrs. Brown says,"I remember when I  
 used to come to the Church with my    
 family. It used to be nearly full, but
 now we only get about 15 people. My   
 family all have children of their own 
 and don't bother coming. I have been  
 coming ever since I remember."        
   The Minister is Rosemary Wakin, who 
 came two years ago.
