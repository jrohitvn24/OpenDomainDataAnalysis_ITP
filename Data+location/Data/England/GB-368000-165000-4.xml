		<title>04THE COTSWOLD WAY WEST BATH</title>
		<content> We went in our teacher's car to the   
{Cotswold Way}where we went on a public
 footpath.The Cotswold way is a long   
{walkway,}the path is rough in some    
 areas.It is steep in some places and  
 there is lots of rough ground,but in  
 other areas the ground is quite       
 flat.If it's a nice clear day you can 
 see for miles on the top of the       
 hills.Altogether it is a nice walk and
 there are a lot of{wild flowers and   
{trees.}There is a{view point}on the   
{Cotswold Way}which allows you to see  
 a long way.After we had looked at the 
 view for quite a while we walked along
 a bit and jumped over a stile and came
 to a farm called{Pendean Farm.        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
