		<content> Holdenhurst was known as{Holeest}in   
 1086,and consisted of 22 hides and    
 half a virgate. There was land for 20 
 ploughs (approximately 2400 acres) and
 181 acres of meadow land. The         
 population was at least 380. It was an
 agricultural community.Today there are
 25 people living in the village, 14   
 around the green.In 1086 the woodland 
 was oak and beech, and today oaks are 
 prominent and some are 200 years old. 
 There is a horse chestnut tree which  
 is 300 years old and the oldest tree  
 in Bournemouth.The community is still 
 based on agriculture although there   
 are a baker,a florist and a teacher   
 living in the village. The church was 
 built in 1833 and stands on the site  
 of the original Anglo-Saxon church.The
 village,though small has many         
 convenieces.The green remains the     
 focal point of this delightful village</content>
