		<title>02CLARENS GUEST HOUSE,VENTNOR.</title>
		<content> Clarens Guest House was taken over by 
 Mrs. and Mrs. T. Brown in December    
 1984. Situated in Alpine Road it has  
 panoramic views from every bedroom. It
 caters for 18 guests mainly from      
 Yorkshire and Lancashire and Southern 
 England. Like most family-run guest   
 houses in the town the tariffs are    
 modest but the atmosphere is homely   
 and friendly. Mrs. Brown employs one  
 person to help with the cleaning. Fire
 precautions have been installed       
 recently. Only one bedroom has a      
 private shower and toilet but there   
 are two other bathrooms. There is a   
 coloured T.V. in the lounge and       
 jig-saw games and books are available 
 for wet days. One new facility this   
 year is champagne honeymoon           
 breakfasts. In 1986 Mrs. Brown intends
 to cater for school parties.
