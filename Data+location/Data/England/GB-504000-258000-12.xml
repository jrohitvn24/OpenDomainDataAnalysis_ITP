		<title>12The Villager, Thurleigh</title>
		<content> The Church produces amagazine called  
 the Villager. This is published once a
 month, 11 months a year. It is        
 delivered free of charge to every     
 household in Thurleigh and Milton     
 Ernest. The cost of printing the      
 magazine is covered by the advertising
 space on the cover. The first page is 
 always written by the vicar and the   
 rest of the magazine is edited by a   
 volunteer. The magazine is twofold in 
 it's value; not only does it bring the
 message of the Church into every      
 household, it also covers all         
 community items involving the 2       
 villages, articles for sale and       
 forthcoming events. This is a good way
 of ensuring that everyone in the area 
 is kept abreast of what is happening  
 and also makes for a caring community.
