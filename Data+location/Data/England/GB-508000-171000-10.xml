		<title>10GAMES AND POEMS</title>
		<content> These are some poems that we sing when
 we are skipping or playing french     
 skipping. French skipping is a game   
 that you play with a piece of elastic 
 which you jump over.                  
 Skipping:-Doctor Doctor.              
 Doctor,Doctor how's your wife,        
 Very well thank you she's alright,    
 She can't eat liquorice,              
 She can't eat biscuits,               
 OUT spells out,                       
 OVER spells over,                     
 UNDER spells under,                   
 IN spells in,                         
 You can't get out till you turn round,
 touch the ground, count to sixteen    
 with your eyes shut.                  
 French Skipping:_Big Ben              
 Big Ben strikes 10 inside,outside     
 scales                                
 Spangle,jingle,jangle,scales inside   
 sangle out.                           </content>
