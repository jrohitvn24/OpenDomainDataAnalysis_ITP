 This is easily the smallest community 
 of the three we examined. The 12th cen
 tury church stands to one side of the 
 few houses which include a handful of 
 semi-detached houses built after the  
 Second World War.  The old school,    
 built in 1884, still stands but is now
 a garage.  The finest house is a manor
 house built in 1826. The one public   
 house is the Lion Inn built about 1850
                                       
                                       
{Roydon}                               
                                       
 Roydon is much more of a village. It  
 stands around the Village Green with  
 the mediaeval church on the other side
 of the road.  There are four public   
 houses and a small number of shops.
