		<title>17LIFE STYLES-ARMTHORPE CHILD</title>
		<content>  I am{14 years}old and I go to        
 Armthorpe Comprehensive{School.}I     
 enjoy lessons except Latin.The level  
 of discipline is acceptable to me.I   
 would like to have a career in        
 languages.                            
  Armthorpe is a{pleasant village}to   
 live in and has more to offer someone 
 of my age than the town.We have the   
 leisure centre and I also enjoy the   
 youth club,dancing and riding.        
  The{shops}I frequent are Chelsea Girl
 and Top Shop and I think Â£3.50 is     
 about the right amount of{pocket money
 for someone of my age.                
  I can understand why some people can 
 be persuaded to take{drugs}but I think
 they are stupid.There is too much     
{vandalism}in this village.The{violence
 around doesn't frighten me too much   
 bescause you learn to avoid the likely
 places for it.                        </content>
