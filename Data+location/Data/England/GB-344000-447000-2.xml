		<title>02The Manor of Winmarleigh</title>
		<content> Although man has been active in the   
 area for thousands of years little is 
 really known of this early history.   
 Winmarleigh-Wunemerleye as it is first
 recorded in 1200- and Cockerham - Coc-
 reham in Domesday - are vills of some 
 antiquity.                            
 The manor of Winmarleigh was held by  
{Sir Gilbert Gerard,}Attorney General  
 and Master of the Rolls,in the 16th   
 century.By marriage it passed to the  
{Spencers}of Ashton,Lancaster and on to
 the{Stanleys.}The Stanleys had to sell
 to clear one Lady Derby's debts and it
 was bought by the{Pattens.            
 The estate has been sold twice since  
 the{Wilson-Pattens}owned it and at    
 present the major landowner is the    
{Duchy of Lancaster}with something in  
 the region of half the old eatate.The 
 rest is County Council owned(the      
 college) and private farms and houses.</content>
