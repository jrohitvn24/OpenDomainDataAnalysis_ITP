   The Centre caters for anyone who    
 wants to come along and enjoy         
 themselves. Clubs use the facilities  
 and they hold matches with other      
 clubs.Also the hangar is used on      
 occasion for County and National      
 events.                               
   The life-style of today does not    
 demand a person to take a lot of      
 exercise. A centre such as this       
 encourages people to stay fit and     
 healthy.                              
   During the day Keep Fit sessions are
 held for housewives. These are very   
 well attended. There is also a        
 multi-gym for hire. This is a machine 
 specially designed to develop all the 
 different muscles of the body. A      
 work-out on this apparatus has to be  
 geared to a person's needs.           </content>
