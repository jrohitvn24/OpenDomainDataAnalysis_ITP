		<title>01THE AYLMERTON AREA</title>
		<content> The area contains the highest point in
 Norfolk - 102 metres - at{Roman Camp. 
 From this point, the land dips very   
 gently southwards but steeply         
 northwards, and is part of the{       
{Cromer-Holt Ridge}- a glacial terminal
 moraine.                              
 The steep slope composed of sands and 
 gravels is wooded, while the lighter  
 sandy soils on the gentle slope are   
 used for arable farming.              
 Sand and gravel deposits are quarried 
 in Britons Lane, and concrete products
 are made - the only manufacturing in  
 the area.  The east of the area is    
 thickly wooded on the Felbrigg Estate,
 and{Felbrigg Hall,}now run by the{    
{National Trust,}attracts many people. 
 Caravan sites near Roman Camp confirm 
 the importance of tourism.            
 The main settlement is{Aylmerton,}a   
 quiet unspoilt rural community.       </content>
