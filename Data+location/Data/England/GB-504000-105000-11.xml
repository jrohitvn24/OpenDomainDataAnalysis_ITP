		<title>11A GAMEKEEPER'S DAY</title>
		<content> Mr Ireland is Head Gamekeeper for     
 Arundel Park. He is employed by the   
 Norfolk Estate to manage 4,500 acres  
 between Slindon and Patching, the     
 South Downs Way and the A27. His job  
 is to breed and release birds for     
 shooting. A day's shooting costs Â£200.
 After release the birds are still     
 given food and water as the dry Downs 
 provide little food. He rises         
 at 5.30 goes to the pheasant runs and 
 checks that the 1500 birds are warm   
 and have food and water. He then feeds
 the stock partridges. After breakfast 
 he exercises his dogs and carries out 
 gamekeeping duties such as feeding    
 posts and checking fox traps. He      
 leaves one fox for the hunt. His day  
 ends at 11pm although in the shooting 
 season he has to patrol the park for  
 poachers. Most damage is done by the  
 public and their dogs.                </content>
