		<title>09RUNS TO CROSFIELDS</title>
		<content> Three boys did a survey on how far    
 pupils and teachers travel to and from
 Crosfields school. These are the      
 results:                              
 31 people live under 5 miles away.    
 54 people live 5 to 9 miles away.     
 40 people live 10 to 14 miles away.   
 05 people live 15 to 19 miles away.   
 02 people live 20 to 24 miles away.   
 We found out in the survey that people
 come from far away to Crosfields      
 school. This is because their parents 
 think it is a good school. Quite a lot
 of people use runs, the parents take  
 turns in taking a group of boys to    
 school. Also boys use private buses   
 which collect those boys who live far 
 away and whose parents are not able to
 take their sons to and from school.
