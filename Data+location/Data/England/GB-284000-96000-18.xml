  I woke up at about seven thirty and  
 fed the animals,which include the     
 dog,cat guinea pig and sheep.I had no 
 breakfast.Then I took the dog for a   
 walk.When I came back I had dinner    
 which consisted today of sandwiches.  
{ Afterwards I mowed the lawn.Then I   
{went down to the River Yeo and did    
{some canoeing.The canoe,which is a one
{seater,is very stable and did not tip 
{over.After tea I fed the bullocks.
