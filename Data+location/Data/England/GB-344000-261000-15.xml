		<title>15MOVEMENT OF FAMILIES</title>
		<content>   We asked the children in our school 
 whose families had moved into the area
 to tell us why they came here.  We    
 found that most people moved because  
 they had changed their employment or  
 because they wanted a different house.
 Here are our results:                 
 REASONS WHY PEOPLE MOVED INTO OUR AREA
 Change of employment...  ...  ...  12 
 Moved to a larger house  ...  ...   8 
 Moved to a better house  ...  ...   4 
 Moved to a less expensive house..   2 
 Wanted to live in the countryside   1 
                                       
   Because these families have children
 at school these statistics refer only 
 to younger people and take no account 
 of older people who might have moved  
 for other reasons (e.g. retirement).  
 Four families left the area recently  
 because of changes in employment.
