		<title>05THE RIVER DART</title>
		<content> On the 15th May 1985 we interviewed   
 Mr.Parnell, who has lived in Stoke    
 Gabriel all his life. He is one of the
 main people in the Boating Association
 and knows a lot about the river. He   
 has been Chairman of th Parish Council
 for many years.                       
 We asked about the pontoon. It had    
 been there since 1972. It is made of  
 wood and has 64 moorings. On the river
 there are 6 passenger boats. When you 
 go on a trip on one it takes you up   
 the river towards Totnes. There is a  
 dam on the quay which is to stop the  
 water going out too fast. It has been 
 there for about 250 years. The biggest
 tide there has ever been was 5.5m. The
 River Dart is one of the seven rivers 
 with salmon. The biggest ever caught  
 was 52 pounds.
