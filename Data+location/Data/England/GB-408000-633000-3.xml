		<title>03Cultivated Land</title>
		<content> The area is a traditional farming     
 community and much of the land is     
 devoted to cultivating crops. The flat
 and slightly undulating land together 
 with rich soils provide a good base   
 for profitable farming. The areas     
 where crops are grown are mainly flat 
 valley floors, although crops can be  
 found on the hilly ground nearby.     
 The farmland is mainly cultivated with
 barley, corn, hay and other cereal    
 crops. Root vegetables such as turnips
 and potatoes are also grown as well   
 other vegetables such as peas. The    
 original field dimensions have largely
 been retained with hawthorn and holly 
 hedges enclosing the fields. Recently 
 the main farmers had the opportunity  
 to enlarge their acreage when the     
 firm, McLaren, who were the main      
 landowners, sold all their land.
