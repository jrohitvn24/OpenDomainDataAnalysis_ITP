		<title>05SPORT - SAILING</title>
		<content>   The area is noted for its sailing   
 and golfing facilities. Sailing is    
 centred around the{Hoylake Sailing    
{Club,}which along with West Kirby S.C.
 uses the locally built{"Hilbre"}class 
 boats as well as the more familiar    
 types of craft.  Other yachtsmen moor 
 boats here during the summer. In      
 recent years water skiing has become  
 popular.                              
                                       
   Sadly, sand banks are encroaching   
 and it may soon be impossible to sail 
 from this part of the coast. Already  
 there are problems with Spartina      
 growth on the foreshore, and there are
 fears that an area of marshland will  
 develop, as found in the nearby Dee   
 estuary.  Each year volunteers dig out
 the new growth but may well be        
 fighting a losing battle.
