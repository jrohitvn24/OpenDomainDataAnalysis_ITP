		<content> The main shops in Ticehurst village   
 are found very close to the village   
 centre. These include a grocers,      
 greengrocers, butchers, bakers,       
 chemist, hardware store, hairdressers,
 cleaners and a sub post office selling
 newspapers, sweets and tobacco. A     
 second grocer is at the other end of  
 the village. A small survey of 38     
 adults showed only one person never   
 used local shops, 8 did all their main
 shopping in Ticehurst and the rest    
 shopped locally but did their main    
 shopping elsewhwere, usually Tunbridge
 Wells or Hastings. The two main       
 reasons for this being the lower      
 prices and greater choice offered by  
 town super stores. The four people    
 using bus used Tunbridge Wells. All   
 other travelling was by car. Most     
 missed is some form of take away food 
 shop especially fish and chips.       </content>
