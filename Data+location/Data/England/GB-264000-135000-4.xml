		<content> The  parish church of St.Peter is a   
 small stone church which was probably 
 built during the twelfth century.     
 Since then the church has seen much   
 restoration and improvement,much of   
 which was organised and paid for by   
 the Rev.John Pinder,during the        
 nineteenth century.                   
  The improvements included the        
 building of a bell tower with six     
 bells;a church clock,given by two     
 sisters as a gift to the              
 parishioners;an organ,paid for by the 
 parishioners,and a stained glass      
 window given by the wife of           
 Rev.Pinder. The present rector of the 
 church is the Rev.John Hornby.        
  The church is used by residents of   
 Bratton Fleming and surrounding       
 hamlets. Sunday services are held at  
 9.45a.m. and 6.30p.m. There are also  
 two chapels,one Baptist,one Methodist.</content>
