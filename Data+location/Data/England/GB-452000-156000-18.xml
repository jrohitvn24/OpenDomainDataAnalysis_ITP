		<content>  There are several shops in the       
 village, though some have closed      
 recently. Most people do much of their
 shopping in near-by towns, and the new
 by-pass may have spoilt some of the   
 passing trade.                        
  There are three pubs, all of which   
 now serve meals and light snacks. We  
 have two newsagents, two butchers, one
 grocery store, a greengrocer, a wine  
 shop and an off-licence, an antique   
 dealer and an art shop, and one shop  
 which sells clothes. There is also a  
 chemist who dispenses prescriptions.  
 An old-established business sells     
 coal, animal foods and gardening      
 supplies.                             
  There is a branch of Lloyds Bank     
 which is open every day. The Post     
 Office deals with other money needs.  
 The old fish'n chip shop is now a     
 Chinese takeaway food shop.           </content>
