		<content>Lambing time starts the farmer's year  
in January and goes on until March. In 
April the job is to look after the ewes
and the lambs. This is also the time   
for getting ready for silage time. The 
pit has to be cleaned out and all the  
machinery serviced.                    
June sees the start of silage time, the
tractors go out into the fields with   
mowers and choppers and the cut grass  
is brought back and put in the pit and 
squashed down so all the air is        
squeezed out.                          
Next some hay is made, with this the   
grass is allowed to dry before it is   
brought into the barn.                 
Some farmers manage to get a second    
silage crop in late summer. The time   
has now come to dip the sheep and      
prepare for the sheep sales.           
Soon the year will be over and the     
cycle will start again.                </content>
