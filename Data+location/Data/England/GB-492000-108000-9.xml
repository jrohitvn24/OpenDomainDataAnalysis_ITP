		<content> When the men were taking out the      
 gravel from Eartham Quarry they       
 discovered evidence of very early man 
 there. The evidence which the         
 archeologists have so far found has   
 consisted of a Stone Age camp, with   
 remains of a cooking fire, small      
 animal bones and flint tools.There    
 does not appear to be any human bones,
 so perhaps this tribe moved on.       
 Very close to this camp, the          
 archeologists have also discovered    
 evidence of the oldest beach in       
 Britain, with layers of stone,sand,   
 silt,chalk and flint.                 
 Perhaps Stone Age Man built his camp  
 on the beach, stayed for a while then 
 moved on to a new site when the supply
 of food ran short, or were chased off 
 by another tribe.
