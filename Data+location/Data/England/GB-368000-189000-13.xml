		<content> He finds computers useful to check    
 cars. Using his radio he can find, in 
 15 seconds, the name and address of   
 any owner.                            
 One embarrassing moment he had was    
 when his car broke down and he had to 
 push it to the police station. He had 
 comments from passers by about police 
 having to save petrol. One funny      
 moment was when a swan mistook the wet
 M5 for a lake and landed on it. All   
 the traffic had to stop while six of  
 his colleagues chased it up the road, 
 arrested it and drove away with it    
 held tightly in the back of the car.
