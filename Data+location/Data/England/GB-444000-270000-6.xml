		<content>During the month of June 1985 there    
were several entries from Thurlaston in
the Village News section of the Rugby  
Advertiser.The entry for June 13th told
us "Thurlaston Ladies Club held their  
annual coach outing on June 3rd-a      
gloriously sunny day."They visited     
Lichfield and Langton for a tour of the
John Beswick factory (pottery          
producers)and a visit to Gladstone     
Pottery Museum.                        
The entry for June 28th mentioned      
that "The University of Warwick is     
arranging a Course on local            
history,Â£Thurlaston Past and           
Present'to be held in the village      
hall." People in Thurlaston get most   
of their local news from               
newspapers,but also from               
radio,television,gossip and the Church 
magazine.
