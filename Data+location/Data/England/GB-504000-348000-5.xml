 native villager.He was born in Lincoln
 but moved in 1901 when his father     
 bought a smallholding.He later farmed 
 in North Nottinghamshire and in{1951  
{bought Hall Farm in Leasingham.}The   
 farm extended over most of the west   
 side of the village covering much     
 the land to the west of what was then 
 the main A15 road through Leasingham.

 the development of the village as the 
 population increased.He was a{member  
 of the{village hall commitee,}and     
 devoted a lot of time to raising money
 for the building of the{new village   
{hall}and for the{village playing      
{field.The Crescent,}designed by an
