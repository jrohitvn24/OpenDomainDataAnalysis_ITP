		<title>057-11 IN NORTHWOOD HILLS</title>
		<content> The 7-11 in Northwood Hills first     
 opened some time in the November of   
 '84.It is open from 7a.m. till 11p.m. 
 thus the title of the shop.The shop is
 like an American drug-store.It sells  
 everything you need for everyday      
 life,food,books,drinks and sweets are 
 just a few.It is at the bottom of the 
 hill next to the roundabout and is    
 usually quite full.Most people like it
 but some think that these types of    
 shop will take over and no decent     
 shops will remain.The actual chain of 
 shops originated from America and     
 people are scared of becoming like    
 Americans.Others like the idea of big 
 shops selling everything.They like the
 fast service.Personally I like the    
 idea of the fast service but I        
 wouldn't like all shops to be like    
 this.
