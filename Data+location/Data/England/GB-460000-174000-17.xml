		<title>17EMPLOYMENT AND INDUSTRY</title>
		<content>   In the Tidmarsh area many people are
 retired. Despite the high levels of   
 national unemployment most of the     
 young have jobs. Of the few unemployed
 most of them live in the Wakeman's    
 Council Estate to the west of         
 Pangbourne. Outside farming, there is 
 not a great deal of local employment  
 in the rural areas, many residents are
 commuters 20 people are employed at   
 Tarmac Topblock, established in 1946  
 as a cottage industry. It is owned by 
 CAEC Havard of Bedford and            
 concentrates on producing building    
 blocks. Many locals think the firm    
 obtrusive in the rural environment,   
 but opposition has diminished because 
 of the employment provided. Tidmarsh  
 Forge employs two blacksmiths. It     
 incorporates a mini-museum showing    
 what the Forge makes.
