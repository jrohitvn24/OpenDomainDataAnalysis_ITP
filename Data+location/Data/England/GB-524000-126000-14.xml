		<content> During a survey between 1.00 and 4.30 
 on Sunday June 16th, 27 groups (80    
 people) were interviewed. We found    
 people visit the pond to walk, paint, 
 draw, feed the ducks, exercise        
 dogs,climb trees, take photos, fish   
 and have picnics.They also enjoy the  
 attractive view and wildlife. Most    
 people go to Furnace Pond by car      
 and park beside the lake.A lot of     
 visitors came from Brighton  and Hove 
 but they also came from Crawley,      
 Cuckfield, Bolney, Horsham,Cranleigh, 
 Burgess Hill, Littlehampton,          
 Lindfield, Oxstead, Haywards Heath,   
 Crawley Down. A few people came from  
 other parts of England and abroad.    
 People of all ages visited the pond   
 and most people had been visiting the 
 pond between 2 and 5 years, some for  
 over 10 years. The busiest time was   
 between 3.00 and 4.00                 </content>
