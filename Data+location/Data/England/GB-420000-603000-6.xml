		<content> The solid geology of the area is not  
 conspicuous,the limestone and         
 millstone grit largely being concealed
 by boulder clay drift.Some limestone  
 was quarried and burnt and the lime   
 used to improve  farmland.Extensive   
 coal measures underlie adjacent areas 
 but mining has not been a feature of  
 this area although small scale        
 mining occurred in the past.Tha       
 Acklington Dyke(whin) outcrops        
 alongside the Coquet at Brainshaugh.  
 The retreating ice sheet left it's    
 mark in the area by depositing a thick
 layer of boulder clay.These clays vary
 within the area.North of the Coquet   
 the soil consists of high quality loam
 but south of the river the soils are  
 heavy clay which are improved with    
 slag.At Brotherwick and Warkworth Moor
 sands and gravel occur.Managed care-  
 fully,these soils result in good farms</content>
