  Rough's Wood is supposed to be       
haunted by ghosts of gipsies who were  
alleged to have been murdered.  One    
Halloween the police were called to    
the wood. It turned out to be a woman  
who was sensitive to the supernatural. 
    In Wombourne there is a wood across
the field at the back of my house.     
There is a haunted house there. It is  
very scary. People say it has got a    
skeleton of a person who has been dead 
for hundreds of years in it.
