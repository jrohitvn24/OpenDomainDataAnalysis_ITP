		<title>17LIVING IN CLATFORD</title>
		<content> When doing a study on whether people  
 like living in Clatford, we asked if  
 they liked living here and two-thirds 
 said they did one-sixth said          
 no,one-sixth said it was alright.     
      There are{DISADVANTAGES}and      
 advantages to living in the village.{ 
{LIFESTYLES} are peaceful and quiet,   
 not like a town or city.but some      
 children said there are no fairgrounds
 and not many  activities.The adults   
 like living in the village but there  
 is not a very good {BUS SERVICE }to   
 get to town if you don't drive.       
 On Thursday there is a free bus that  
 will take you into town and back.     
    The family of{DOWLING}have lived in
 Goodworth Clatford since 1538 and has 
 continued here until the present      
 day.Unfortunately the name will now   
 die out though the grandson Lee Belbin
 attends the local school.             </content>
