		<title>20LOWESWATER'S MRS. STUDHOLME</title>
		<content> Mrs. Studholme age 81, now living with
 her daughter at Red How, was born at  
 Lanthwaite Cottage &amp; lived there until
 2 years ago. Her grandfather Vickers  
 lived at Nether Close where her mother
 was born. It is still owned by the    
 family. Her father &amp; uncle worked for 
 the Marshall estate which comprised   
 the lakes Buttermere, Crummock &amp;      
 Loweswater, Holme &amp; Lanthwaite Wood &amp; 
 many farms &amp; houses in the valley.    
 The lakes were netted in Spring &amp;     
 Summer to supply fish to local hotels.
 Most household purchases were         
 delivered monthly by pony &amp; trap but  
 for special items her mother walked to
 Cockermouth. The Scalehill Hotel was  
 called the Bunch of Grapes &amp; the      
 Kirkstyle Inn the Hare and Hound. They
 were traditional Inn-Farms of the Lake
 District &amp; renowned for their Hunt    
 suppers on New Years Day &amp; Boxing Day.</content>
