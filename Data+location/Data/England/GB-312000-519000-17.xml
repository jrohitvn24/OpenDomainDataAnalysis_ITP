		<title>17LOWESWATER SHOW DAY 19-9-85</title>
		<content> The children of Lamplugh School were  
 invited to the show to make a reprt   
 for the Domesday project. The show was
 set in field with Melbreak behind. On 
 18-9-85 there was 4cm rain, we thought
 the show might be cancelled. We were  
 lucky with the weather it was a wet   
 morning followed by a dry afternoon.  
 The show field was very muddy most    
 people wore wellington boots, some    
 wore plastic bags over their shoes.   
 One gateway was really muddy, we      
 squelched around in it. The mud was   
 made worse by tractors and horses and 
 carts going up and down the field.    
 part of the field was flooded, we     
 enjoyed wading in it, it was quite    
 deep. Some of us made a live broadcast
 on Radio Cumbria, we had a good day.  
 At the end of the day cars were       
 getting stuck as they left so we      
 helped by pushing them off the field. </content>
