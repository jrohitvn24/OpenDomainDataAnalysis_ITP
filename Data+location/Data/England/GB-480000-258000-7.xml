		<content>   In{1086}the waters of the River Nene
 turned the paddles of the Clifford    
 Hill Mill to the North of the village 
 grinding corn. Its importance was     
 emphasised by the fact that{William   
{the Conqueror}erected a motte and     
 bailey close by. The mound then passed
 into private ownership when it was    
 lowered and levelled; the owner wanted
 to turn it into a bowling green!{John 
{Clare}used to visit the mound and     
 wrote _ "still I hear the clacking    
 mill, and the river's running under   
 the trysting tree".                   
   At the centre of the village the    
 church enjoys a commanding position.  
 Its{fine tower (13th century)}can be  
 seen for miles around. The village has
 many other fine old buildings built   
 between 1600 and 1750. These together 
 with some lovely stone cottages marks 
 it out as{a conservation area.        </content>
