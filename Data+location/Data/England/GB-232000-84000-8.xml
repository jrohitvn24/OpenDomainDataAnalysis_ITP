		<title>08  AN 11 YEAR OLD BOY'S DAY</title>
		<content> I get up at 6.45 am,have a breakfast  
 of cereal and a glass of milk.I feed  
 my calf and a{taxi}takes me to school.
 It stops at the College and I take    
 about 20 minutes to walk across the   
 park to school.After a{religious      
{assembly}we have mathematics,sometimes
 using our{calculators.}For writing we 
 use a{berol pen}in which the ink flows
 through a fibre tip.Just after 12     
 o'clock we have a school meal of two  
 courses with a choice for each.Roast  
 chicken with two vegetables,chocolate 
 crisp and custard are popular.After an
 hour's lunch break,we watch a{video   
{film,}do project work,art or have     
 music or games.I go home by bus and   
 after tea I play tennis in a club or  
 watch television after I have fed my  
 calf again.I have played in the school
 teams for soccer,cricket and rounders 
 matches,sometimes away on a Saturday. </content>
