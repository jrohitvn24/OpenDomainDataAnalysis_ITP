 The vicar of St Mary's Church.        
 Rev.Pemberton gets up at 7 o'clock.(He
 doesn't like getting up!) He looks at 
 his post. He goes into the Church at 9
 o'clock and meets with the Deaconess, 
 Mrs Wareham. They say morning prayers.
 Then he usually goes home to write    
 letters. In the afternoon he visits   
 people who are sick or in trouble.    
 In the evening he goes into the church
 to say evening prayers, and say       
 Thankyou. In the evenings there are   
 often meetings or confirmation        
 classes. If he is free he sometimes   
 watches television. He has a day off  
 on Friday. He wears special clothes   
 for his job with a white collar.      
 People call this special collar a     
 "dog collar". It helps us recognise a 
 vicar.                                </content>
