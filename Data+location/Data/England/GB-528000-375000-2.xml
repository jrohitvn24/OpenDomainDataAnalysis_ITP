		<content> remaining. Enclosure of the open      
 fields took place in 1804, and there  
 are now eleven arable farms, varying  
 in size from 50 to 450 acres. There is
 no dairy farming, but sheep are kept  
 on two farms, bullocks are fattened,  
 and there are intensive pig and       
 poultry units. Hedges are being       
 steadily removed, and fields becoming 
 much larger each year. The viking way 
 footpath passes roughly north to south
 across the block, and in the north    
 centre of the block is an earthwork   
 (probably a prehistoric round barrow) 
 called Juicetrump Hill. Although      
 entirely agricultural in character,   
 there are now only 25 men in the      
 village employed in agriculture due to
 intensive mechanisation on the farms. 
 This results in others having to      
 commute to work in places such as     
 Louth, Horncastle and Lincoln.        </content>
