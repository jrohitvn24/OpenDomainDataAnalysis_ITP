 ________________                      
 Number of people: 4 or more           
 One person is 'it'.  When 'it' says   
 "go!" everybody runs off while 'it'   
 tries to catch someone.  The person   
 who is caught becomes 'it' and the    
 game continues.                       
                                       
 The rules of UPS AND DOWNS            
 __________________________            
 Number of people: 4+                  
 Ups and downs is played on a court    
 with a line at each end.  Behind the  
 lines is home.  One person is 'it' and
 they stand in between the lines.  Then
 the remaining people have to run from 
 one home to the other.  If 'it'       
 catches them then they are 'it' as    
 well.
