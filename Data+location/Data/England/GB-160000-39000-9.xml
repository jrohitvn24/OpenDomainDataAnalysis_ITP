		<content> These plants were arranged in rows    
 according to their varieties and their
 harvesting time.Included among the    
 crops in this field were Brussel      
 Sprouts,Winter Cauliflower,Potatoes   
 and French Beans. Several of these    
 crops were being tested for large     
 commercial companies.Included among   
 the winter cauliflower was a variety  
 which Mr.Bennet and some of his       
 colleagues had developed themselves   
 which was ideally suited for local    
 conditions.Despite running a modern   
 farm and using modern methods for     
 efficient production,Mr.Bennet is     
 careful not to disturb the balance of 
 nature more than he must to make his  
 farm profitable and to support his    
 family.
