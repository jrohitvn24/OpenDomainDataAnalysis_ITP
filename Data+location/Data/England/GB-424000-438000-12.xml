		<content> In Cookridge we have good sporting    
 facilities because we have a sports   
 centre which is used by many people.  
 In the sports centre there is an      
 indoor swimming pool and badminton and
 squash courts. There are facilities   
 for table tennis, gymnastics, keep fit
 and basket ball. We have other sports 
 facilities outside like a cricket     
 field, rugby and football pitches and 
 some tennis courts. Cookridge has a   
 cricket team which plays in a local   
 league. There is a play area with     
 swings and slides for small children. 
 Keep fit and yoga classes are held in 
 the Village Hall, the sports centre   
 and in the schools in the evening. We 
 found that a lot of people like to    
 take part in sport because they have  
 to travel to work by bus or car and   
 have jobs where many are sitting down.
 Sport helps them to keep fit.         </content>
