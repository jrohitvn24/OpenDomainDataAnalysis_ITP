		<content>  This 12 km area includes parts of    
 Brandon, Bretford, Brinklow, Binley   
 Woods, and Wolston.                   
  The main attractions are the Speedway
 - the home of the "Coventry Bees". The
 garden centre - Oakdale Nursery. We   
 have two public houses - The Queen's  
 Head and the Royal Oak both of which  
 do meals and snacks. We boast one     
 hotel - The Brandon Hall Hotel which  
 has a 3 star rating.                  
  There are several farms in the area  
 and two riding stables.               
  Part of the Fosse Way (the Roman     
 Road) runs through our area as does   
 the river Avon.                       
  There are also two schools - Binley  
 Woods Middle School,which takes       
 pupils from the villages of           
 Brandon,Wolston and Binley Woods.An   
 elementary school still stands at     
 Brandon but this was closed in 1969.  </content>
