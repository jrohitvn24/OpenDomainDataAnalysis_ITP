 Only 200 people can use the pool at   
 once because there are only 200       
 baskets for peoples clothes though    
 it would be possible for more people  
 to use the water. Lessons go on       
 continuosly from 9.00am to 7.50pm from
 Mondays to Fridays and there are two  
 swimming club sessions every evening  
 from 8.00pm to 9.00pm and from 9.00 to
 10.00pm. The five clubs which use the 
 pool are Belper Ladies, Thorntons,    
 Glowworm, Belper Malin and the        
 Sub_aqua club. The water in the pool  
 is never changed. When the dirty water
 splashes out of the pool it drains    
 back into a big pipe and into a filter
 of sand. As the water runs through the
 sand it is then pumped into a heater  
 and returned into a pool.
