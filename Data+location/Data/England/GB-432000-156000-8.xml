 My name is Joanne Brock. I live at    
 Pond Cottage in Vernham Dean. I am

 school we go for an adventure week but
 only the older children can go.Once we
 went to Minehead in Somerset. This    
 year we went to Duporth in Cornwall.  
  At home I own a bicycle. My house has
 got 4 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, 1 kitchen
 2 lounges 1 utility room, a hall and 2
 staircases.  We have got 1 cat and    
 lots of fish.  Also in the house which
 has a large modern extention there is 
 an old fireplace and a very old       
 staircase.  I go to school every      
 day.In my spare time I play with my   
 friends. At school I like maths and   
 games and country dancing.
