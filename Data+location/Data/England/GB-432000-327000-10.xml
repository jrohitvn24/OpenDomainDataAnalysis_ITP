		<title>10INGLEBY ENVIRONMENT</title>
		<content> Ingleby is a very small village with  
 15 houses,3 farms,and a pub "The John 
 Thompson" named after its landlord.   
                                       
 Ash farm is the largest farm in       
 Ingleby and its main produce is dairy 
 products.The farmer has 148 Freisian  
 dairy cows and a bull.                
                                       
 The fields around Ingleby tend to be  
 grass for grazing and silage,and hay  
 and corn for food.There were 4 houses 
 in the village named after trees:Yew  
 Tree Cottage,Sycamore Farm,Elm Farm,  
 and Ash Farm.                         
                                       
 There was a postbox,a signpost,a      
 streetlight,and an occasional stretch 
 of pavement.Sycamore Farm had 10      
 calves in its garden.People we met    
 either worked in Ingleby,commuted,or  
 were retired.                         </content>
