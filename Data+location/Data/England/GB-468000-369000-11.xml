		<content> There are two shops in Walesby, one is
 the village Post Office and general   
 store, the second is a former Co-op   
 store closed in the early 1980's that 
 has now been re-opened as a general   
 store. Both these shops have licenses 
 to sell alcohol. Although these two   
 premises will provide for the         
 immediate needs of the villagers a    
 survey carried out recently showed    
 that families travel to large         
 supermarkets for their regular        
 shopping trips, making these journeys 
 to places such as Mansfield, Ollerton 
 and Retford, usually on a weekly or   
 monthly basis.                        
 The village of Kirton has no shop at  
 all, the former village Post Office   
 having closed recently.               
 Both villages also have regular visits
 from mobile shops such as the butcher.
