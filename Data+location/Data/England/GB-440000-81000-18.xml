		<title>18WAYTES COURT FARM,BRIGHSTONE</title>
		<content>  This farm has 400 acres of which 180 
 acres were ploughed this season. The  
 rest of the land is used for grazing  
 beef cattle.The crops grown arewheat, 
 barley and winter oats. He also grows 
 some potatoes.His crops are all sold, 
 not fed to the animals. The barley    
 goes to make beer!He does make silage 
 for his animals however.This is       
 processed grass which is put into a   
 clamp at the farm and fermented.      
  As well as the cows the farmer keeps 
 a few sheep and a sheep_dog. However  
 the beef cattle are the main concern. 
 They are bought as calves not bred at 
 the farm. Then they are fed on protein
 barley which the farmer has to buy in.
 He then sells the cattle for meat.    
  The farmer's wife keps house and is  
 always around to answer the telephone.
