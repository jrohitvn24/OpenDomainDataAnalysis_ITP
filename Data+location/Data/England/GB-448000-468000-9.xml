 The population of the area seems to be
 slowly falling.According to the 1981  
 census there were 13 less people than 
 in 1971 and 175 less than one hundred 
 years ago.The reason for this is      
 probably that people have moved away  
 from the area as their jobs on the    
 land have gone to machinery.Young     
 people often find that they have to go
 into York to find work.Even so there  
 was less than 5% unemployment amongst 
 men aged between 16 and 64 in         
 1981.This was lower than the rate for 
 Easingwold.Nor were there a large     
 number of old people beyond working   
 age, less than one person in five in  
 1981, again fewer than in Easingwold.
