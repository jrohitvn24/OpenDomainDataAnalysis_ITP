		<content> Elland has for its size and capacity, 
 been the foremost, and most utilised  
 station with 60 megawatt units in the 
 country, and still enjoys a high      
 position in the country's generating  
 league.  Since 1959 the station has   
 consumed over 13 million tonnes of    
 coal and produced over 26,000 million 
 kw/hrs of electricity  and at present 
 employs 170 people.                   
 The ash and dust, which is residue    
 after combustion of the coal, is used 
 in the construction of motorways,     
 environmental landscaping, and for the
 manufacture of materials for the      
 construction industry.
