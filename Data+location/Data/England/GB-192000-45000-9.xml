		<content>   In our D-Block there are several    
 environments,including wood, heath,   
 village and the river Fal.In the      
 woods around the area there           
 are rabbits, squirrels, mice, foxes,  
 badgers, stoats and weasels. The      
 number of rabbits has doubled over a  
 year. In contrast there are very few  
 hares.Foxes are few in the area, they 
 are pests to the gamekeepers but the  
 Trewithen gamekeeper keeps two        
 twelve-month old fox cubs as pets!    
   There are three members of the      
 stoat family which cause trouble      
 for farmers.They are the stoat, weasel
 and mink.The mink went into decline   
 but is now making a comeback.It lives 
 near the river.                       
   The lack of small birds is accounted
 for by a pair of buzzards in the Fal  
 valley.The remaining small birds are  
 finches and warblers.                 </content>
