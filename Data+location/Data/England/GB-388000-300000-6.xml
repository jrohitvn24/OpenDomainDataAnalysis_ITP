		<title>06BIRMINGHAM CANAL NAVIGATION</title>
		<content> The Birmingham Canal Navigation       
stretches from Birmingham to its       
junction with the Staffordshire &amp;      
Worcestershire Canal at Aldersley.     
 The section between Broad Street Basin
and Aldersley is the "Wolverhampton 21"
(this section having 21 locks).It can  
be further divided into two parts:     
"Town Locks" -Broad Street to Dunstall 
"Dunstall Locks" -Dunstall to Aldersley
The two parts are separated by the     
railway viaduct at Dunstall and are    
strikingly different. The urban "Town  
Locks" looks out on waste land and     
factory units. It is dominated by the  
Crown Street Refuse Disposal Plant.    
The semi-rural "Dunstall Locks" passes 
Dunstall Park Race Course and quiet    
countryside near Aldersley.            
 The Birmingham Canal Navigation is now
termed a "Cruising Waterway" and is    
very popular at holiday times.         </content>
