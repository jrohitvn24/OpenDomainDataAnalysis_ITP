		<content> Most people who live in{Bourton-on-   
{the-Water}shop in the village where   
 there is a wide range of shops even   
 though there is a{high proportion}of  
 gift shops catering for visitors.{Most
{villagers}interviewed about their     
{shopping habits}say they would rather 
{support the local shops}even though   
 prices may be higher than in town     
 supermarkets. Two shops, the          
{International}and{the Cotswold Store,}
 provide many local people with their  
 everyday needs, most shopping once a  
 week. Those with private cars         
 frequently shop in{Cheltenham,        
{Cirencester, Banbury}and{Chipping     
{Norton.}There are no shops in{Wyck    
{Rissington}or{Little Rissington}though
 papers, groceries and meat are        
 delivered to the two villages. Most   
 villagers shop in{Bourton, Cheltenham,
{Stow-on-the-Wold}or{Moreton-in-Marsh. </content>
