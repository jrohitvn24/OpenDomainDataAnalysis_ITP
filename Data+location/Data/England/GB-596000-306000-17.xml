		<content>{Letton Road Nurseries}covers 5 acres. 
 It includes 4 green-houses and 6      
 plastic tunnels. It mainly grows salad
 vegetables such as cucumbers, tomatoes
 lettuces and green peppers. They also 
 grow house plants. The produce is     
 distributed locally with unsold plants
 ending up on the compost heap. Most of
 the plants are grown from seeds, and  
 geraniums and fuschias are started    
 from cuttings. They are grown in seed 
 trays, pots and soil blocks. The      
 plants are watered by irrigation      
 sprinklers. The water comes from a    
 bore-hole because water pressure is   
 too low locally to operate the system.
 The largest greenhouse is 11,600sq.ft.
 and is cooled by solar-sensitive      
 automatic ventilators. They employ 1  
 full-time and 2 part-time workers with
 children helping at weekends.
