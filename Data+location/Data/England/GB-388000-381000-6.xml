		<content> The largest employer in  the area is  
 British Aerospace.The aerodrome at    
 Woodford was built in  1925 after the 
 land had been purchased from a farmer.
 The one condition of selling the land 
 was that the farmers family would be  
 employed for life.The last of the     
 Holland family still lives in a farm  
 house near the first hangars that were
 built.He retired a few years ago.     
  In world war 2 the aerodrome was used
 for making  Lancaster bombers.They    
 made about 29 a month with the help of
 four companies.The companies  were    
 Metropolitan Vickers,Armstrong        
 Whitworth,Vickers (West Bromich and   
 Chester) and Austin Motor Company.
