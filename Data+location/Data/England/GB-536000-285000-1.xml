		<title>01Chatteris:An Overall View</title>
		<content>     Chatteris is a small town in the  
 fens with a population of 6180. It is 
 a fen island surrounded by very       
 fertile peaty farmland suitable for   
 growing root and cereal crops and is  
 particularly famous for the growing of
 carrots. Much of the surrounding land 
 lies at or below sea level. To the    
 west of the town the landscape appears
 very flat and there are few trees and 
 bushes. Drainage is important.        
    Several of the town's industries   
 are connected with agriculture, such  
 as vegetable packing and haulage.There
 are also other light industries such  
 as the engineering works of Stainless 
 Metalcraft. The main industrial areas 
 are in the north and west of the town.
    At present a new network of roads  
 is being planned and built in the area
 which will help communications with   
 the midlands, north and south.        </content>
