		<content> The County Primary school in our area 
 is St.Edmund's.It was constituted into
 a primary school in 1984,having been  
 separate infant and junior schools.It 
 is situated on the A1078 leading into 
 King's Lynn and its catchment area is 
 the North Lynn estate.The children    
 have to go under a subway to the      
 school, as it is on the opposite side 
 of the road.It became an all through  
 primary school due to a drastic fall  
 in numbers.                           
 The special school is the Alderman    
 Jackson,it caters for children with   
 severe mental and physical handicaps. 
 It accepts children from a wide catch_
 ment area-approx.15mlradius.The school
  is well supported locally and is well
 equipped with a wide range of thera-  
 peutic toys and a hydrotherapy indoor
