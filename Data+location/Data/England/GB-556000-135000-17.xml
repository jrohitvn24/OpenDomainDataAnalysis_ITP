		<title>17INTERVIEWING MUMMY AND DADDY</title>
		<content> My Mummy and Daddy work in a pub,     
 Mummy works in the restaurant and     
 Daddy works in the Bar but Mummy      
 wishes that she could work in the Bar 
 and Daddy wishes that he could work in
 the restaurant.  On Saturday I        
 interveiwed Mummy and Daddy and here  
 are some of the questions:I asked     
 Mummy if she gets friends in the      
 restaurant and mummy said she gets a  
 lot of people in the restaurant that  
 she knows.  I asked Mummy if she gets 
 a lot of people in the restaurant and 
 Mummy said that the busiest days of   
 the week are Tuesday, Wednesday and   
 Saturday.  Then I interviewed Daddy.  
 Daddy is much busier than Mummy       
 everyday.  Daddy's busiest days of the
 week are Wednesday, Tuesday and       
 Saturday and Sunday.  The drink Daddy 
 sells most of is beer and soft drinks 
 .                                     </content>
