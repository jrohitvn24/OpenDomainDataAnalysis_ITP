		<content>    Nab quarry is a dead quarry used as
 a workplace for making fire places and
 for storage for the stone .The stone  
 used comes from quarries in Yorkshire 
 and Derbyshire .Different coloured    
 stone is used-buff,pink and lilac also
 blue Welsh state ,green Cumbrian slate
 brown Cornish slate and marble from   
 Italy , Portugal and Spain.           
    The fire-place design is firstly   
 agreed with a customer and then the   
 stone is cut at the quarry.The stone  
 is then fitted together like a jig    
 saw puzzle but it is not cemented     
 together until it is assembled in the 
 customers home.On average it takes    
 less than a day to build a fire place.
 .                                     
    The four men that work at Nab      
 Quarry can also build arches  between 
 room, small bridges , bars in public  
 houses and frames for church windows. </content>
