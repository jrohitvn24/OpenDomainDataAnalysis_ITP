		<content>   Before 1066 a monk held Woodwick,   
 then from 1066 onwards a man called   
 Ranulf Flambard held it.Woodwick paid 
 tax for 300 acres,which is land for   
 three ploughs.They shared half a mill 
 with Freshford which paid 5s.They had 
 twelve acres of meadow and 30 acres of
 pasture.The value was 20s.After many  
 years people moved to Freshford       
 because it was too small to support a 
 rector.                               
     When the people left Woodwick the 
 village slowly crumbled down and grass
 started to grow over the top of the   
 village.Now all you can see are humps 
 and bumps where cottages used to      
 be.Also now a road has been built over
 the top of the village and a few      
 houses as well.Now the fields are used
 for grazing cattle.
