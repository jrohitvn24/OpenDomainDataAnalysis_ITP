		<title>02THE SHORE LINE</title>
		<content> This is about the view from the       
{shoreline.                            
                                       
 As you walk along the wall there      
 are old{oyster beds }which are to the 
 east of the Osea island causeway.The  
 Osea causeway is not straight probably
 because there is harder rock          
 underneath that may not have been     
 straight and secondly so that the     
 tide would not wash it away.          
      The actual{seawall}itself is     
 made of concrete slabs on top of a    
 mound of earth which is about five    
 metres high.On the mud there were a   
 lot of gun cartridges that came from a
 wildfowl shooting club nearby.        
      If you visit the area I think you
  should take a walk along the wall    
 because it is very interesting,with   
 plenty of things to see and do.
