		<title>06Recreation, Aldwark Area.</title>
		<content> No recreational facilities are        
 provided in Aldwark, but the people   
 gravitate towards Brassington,grid    
 ref. 05430232,where there are such    
 diverse groups as Women's Institute,  
 British Legion, Mothers' Union, Young 
 Farmers' Union and a pre-school       
 playgroup, for the under-fives.       
                                       
 The area is popular with tourists,    
 particularly walkers,and is part of   
 the Peak District National Park.      
 The route of a former railway crosses 
 the SW. corner of the area,and is now 
 used as a long-distance footpath, the 
 High Peak Trail.
