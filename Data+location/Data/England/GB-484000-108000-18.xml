		<title>18Chalkpit Lane</title>
		<content> Chalkpit Lane used to be a coach track
 to London. The lane is now used for   
 farm machines &amp; motorbikes as well as 
 a footpath &amp; bridleway. There are some
 caves placed on the west side, half   
 way up above the chalkpit. The chalk  
 was dug from the pit and heated to    
 form lime. Farmers put it on their    
 fields to sweeten the soil. There are 
 tracks at the top of the lane which   
 were used in winter when the main     
 track got muddy. There are high banks 
 at the side because the rain washed   
 the good soil away.                   
 There is a Dutch barn with hay in it  
 which is falling apart now. Next to   
 the Dutch barn is a yard with a       
 shelter off the north and east side;  
 it was used for animals in days gone  
 by.
