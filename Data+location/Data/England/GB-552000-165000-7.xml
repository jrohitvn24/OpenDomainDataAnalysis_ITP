		<content>To help our local community our cook   
does "meals-on-wheels" service which   
helps the elderly in the village.      
Children under five can attend a play  
group daily in a spare classroom. Our  
school hall is used for lots of clubs  
 nd other activites after school. Our  
school has a Parents Teachers          
Association. They raise a lot of money 
to help us by having jumble sales and  
fetes. They come in sometimes to hear  
us read. They also come in and give us 
transport on our outings. On Tuesday   
they supervise us when we go           
swimming. At Christmas they provide    
food and prizes and help with our      
parties. They help us with our discos  
and on Sports Days. They buy us extra  
epuipment to make our school better for
us.
