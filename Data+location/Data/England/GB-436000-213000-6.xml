		<content>This time of year the farmers are      
letting the cattle out for the summer. 
I interveiwed a farmers wife and she   
told me that she had 500 acres, 250    
acres of corn, wheat and barley and    
250 acres for the cattle.There are two 
types of cattle. They sell the cattle  
three times during the year. Usually in
January, November, and December.They   
check the cattle once in the morning   
and once at night to put water in the  
trough and to check to see if any of   
the cattle have infections.This farm   
has four  combine tractors and lots of 
diggers and insecticide machinery.They 
buy the cattle when they are about 12  
months old.The cattle are beef cattle.
