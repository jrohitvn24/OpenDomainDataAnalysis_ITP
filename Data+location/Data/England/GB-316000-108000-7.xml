		<title>07SMEATHARPE-OUR HOMES</title>
		<content> Many of the houses in Smeatharpe are  
 old cottages and the remainder are    
 fairly new bungalows.                 
 All of the houses have electricity,   
 mains water and septic sewage tanks.  
 There is no piped gas but several     
 residents have bottled gas for cooking
 and heating.                          
 Many of the bungalows have oil-fired  
 central heating. Many homes have oil  
 or solid fuel Raeburn or Aga stoves,  
 which are something of an institution 
 in the country kitchen.  Many cottages
 still have open fires or modern wood- 
 burning stoves.                       
 Almost all the residents have a tele- 
 phone, refridgerator, deep-freeze,    
 washing machine, electric or gas      
 cooker, television, radio, stereo     
 music-centre, car and bicycle.  Some  
 also have video-recording machines or 
 micro-computers.                      </content>
