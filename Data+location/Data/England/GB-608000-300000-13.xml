		<title>13FARM LIFE</title>
		<content>   We visited{two farms}in the area,   
 both of which are Arable. Their crops 
 consist of wheat,barley,mustard,sugar 
 beet and pulses. Some wheat is bought 
 and taken to Manningtree, Essex for   
 malting, some is used in biscuit      
 making at a factory in Middlesex. The 
 sugar beet is sent to the BSC factory 
 at Bury St.Edmunds, and the mustard   
 is bought by Colemans of Norwich. The 
 barley is usually used in beer making 
 by local breweries.                   
   Both farms own various machinery,   
 such as a Combine Harvester,tractors, 
 fertilizer sprayers,and a cultivator. 
 Mr. McClarty who owns the 105 acre    
 Hall Farm is a part-time farmer and is
 assisted by 2 part-time labourers. Mr.
 Hipperson who jointly owns Wood Farm  
 with his brother has no help at his   
 200 acre farm. The farmers work long  
 hours, especially at Harvest time.    </content>
