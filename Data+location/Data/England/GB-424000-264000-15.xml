		<content> Soldiers from barracks paraded to     
 church on Sundays led by              
 antelope,regimental mascot, and band. 
 Played popular tunes on way back.     
 Military funerals held in churchyard  
 Volleys fired over graves.Afterwards  
 scramble by the boys to find empty    
 cartridge cases to play with.Day after
 a villager died biggest Church bell   
 would be rung,once for a man,twice for
 a woman.Then age would be tolled.The  
 children enjoyed counting rings to    
 find age.If Lord and Lady Dormer came 
 through the village children had to   
 run to the side of the road and bow or
 curtsey.Each house had 1 or 2 pigs in 
 the back garden 'Bodger'Hall(Ena's    
 father who was a butcher before he    
 became a shepherd)used to kill them   
 When the children heard the squeals   
 they raced there.The first got        
 inflated bladder tied to a stick.     </content>
