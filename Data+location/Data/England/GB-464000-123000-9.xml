		<title>09RECREATION - SPORT 2</title>
		<content>   Sport is thought of as an important 
 pastime for young people, and in the  
 last year a co-ordinator has been     
 appointed by the Sports Club to liase 
 with local youth groups and the school
 in order to better provide for the    
 latters' sporting needs.              
   The new Sports Pavilion at the      
 Recreation Field has taken 7 years to 
 build largely by the Sports Club      
 members' own labour and at a cost of  
 Â£22,000, raised by the members        
 themselves.                           
   Nearby is the Rifle Range, built 4  
 years ago, by its members' own labour 
 and fund raising. Three teams, as well
 as individuals and pairs enter        
 competitions. Outdoor shooting is a   
 traditional pastime, with most of the 
 farmers raising their own pheasants   
 for the shoot. One farmer employs a   
 gamekeeper.                           </content>
