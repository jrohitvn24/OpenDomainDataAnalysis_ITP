 and Gloucestershire provide free      
 education for all children aged 5-18 &amp;

 the village schools closed, children  
 from the Wolfords attend either       
 Shipston on Stour or Long Compton     
 School. Todenham Children go to       
 Moreton in Marsh an option open also  
 to Great Wolford. At eleven, Todenham 
 children go to Chipping Campden School
 and Little Wolford to Shipston. Great 
 Wolford has a choice of either. At 16 
 it is possible to go to Colleges of
