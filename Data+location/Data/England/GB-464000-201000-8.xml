		<title>08   Farming around Haseley</title>
		<content>  We went with Mrs Walker to look at   
the fields around Haseley.Close to the 
village we found fields growing wheat, 
kale and beans.Then we went down       
Latchford and saw barley,beans and     
potatoes.The latter were being grown   
for sale to a potato crisp factory.    
  Nearby we saw some fields with grass 
in and horses grazing.Other fields were
being used for hay and silage making.We
carried on to the site of the old      
hamlet of Latchford and went along the 
farm track.Most of the fields had corn 
crops in them but some were grass      
pasture.In one field tractors were out 
muck-spreading.We also saw some people 
out on their horses.We came back to    
Haseley and looked across towards the  
motorway from the playing field.We     
could see a mixture of corn and grass  
fields.Cows were grazing in the latter.
