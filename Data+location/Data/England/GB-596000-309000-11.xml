		<title>11RECREATION: TOFTWOOD AREA</title>
		<content> Although over 5,000 people live in    
 this area, there are actually very few
 recreational facilities available near
 to where the people live. Most        
 facilities are located 2 miles away in
 the centre of Dereham such as swimming
 pool, tennis and squash club, golf    
 course, bowls club etc. Below is a    
 list of the different recreational    
 facilities we found in our area:      
 Fred Nicholson School: Football,      
 Cricket and Rugby pitches in Westfield
 Road.

 and field, Westfield Road.
