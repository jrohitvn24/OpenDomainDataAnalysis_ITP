		<title>08CROSSTOWN KNUTSFORD</title>
		<content> About half the Crosstown area of      
 Knutsford falls within our survey.    
 This part of town too is almost       
 entirely residential but different    
 in character from the Shaw Heath and  
 Longridge estates previously          
 described.  The housing here is a     
 mixture of council- and privately-    
 owned dwellings (some very expensive).
 Many of the people who live here      
 commute out of Knutsford to work.     
 There are 3 schools in Crosstown; St. 
 Vincent's R C Aided Primary School    
 which takes children aged 5-11 from a 
 very wide area, Crosstown County      
 Infant School (ages 5-7) and, adjacent
 to this, Norbury Booths County Junior 
 School (ages 7-11).                   
 At the southern end, and once on the  
 outskirts of the town, is the base of 
 a well-established Nursery and Garden 
 Centre around which houses have grown.</content>
