		<title>17CHELMSFORD GOLF COURSE</title>
		<content> Chelmsford Golf Course occupies an an 
 area of some 127 acres and is just to 
 the south of{St.John's Hospital}and to
 the east of the the main railway line 
 and the present A12 trunk road.The    
 course is not easily seen by the      
 passer-by as it is bounded by the     
 railway,housing and farmland.         
                                       
 The course has been open on this site 
 since 1922. Before that the land was  
 used partly as farmland and partly as 
 a{brick works.}                       
                                       
 The course is not open to the general 
 public as it is a private club;there  
 are approximately 650 members.        
                                       
    The piece of woodland called {     
{Thriftwood,}which is surrounded by the
 golf course, also belongs to the club.
