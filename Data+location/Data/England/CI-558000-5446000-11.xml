		<title>11THE HONORARY SYSTEM</title>
		<content>  Local government in Jersey is quite  
 different in organisation from that of
 England. It is based around the       
 Parish, of which there are twelve. The
 head of the parish is the Constable.  
 He is elected by the parishioners, and
 has a seat in The States of Jersey    
 which is the Island's parliament. The 
 Constable is, amongst other things,   
 responsible law and order in the      
 Parish. To help him with this he      
 has a number of other men. They are   
 called Centeniers, Vingteniers, and   
 Constables Officers. All these posts  
 are honorary positions, and are       
 unpaid. The holders of these posts are
 proud to serve their Parish, they are 
 following a tradition that goes back  
 centuries. Although 'paid' police     
 often deal with crime these days, the 
 honorary police must still be involved
 often presenting prosecution cases.   </content>
