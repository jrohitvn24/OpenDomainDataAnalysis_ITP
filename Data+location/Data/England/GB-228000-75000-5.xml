 I wake up at 7:40 am.Breakfast        
 consists of free-range eggs laid      
 by our ducks and hens and toast.      
 Our school bus picks us up at 8:25,as 
 there is no public transport here.    
 Our school bus has problems getting   
 through the narrow lanes.             
 At school on a Monday we write up     
 our diary then we do handwiting.      
 Our first break is from 10:30 to      
 10:45,then from 12:00 to 1:15,then    
 from 2:30 to 2:45.At break time we    
 sometimes go to the field.Our school  
 dinners are prepared at Launceston and
 are just warmed up in our canteen,it  
 is very small for 65p.After school it 
 is sports club,at the moment we are   
 practising for cluster sports.When we 
 get home we have tea,pick up Drystan  
 Jones and go to judo in Liskeard.When 
 we get back I go to bed.              </content>
