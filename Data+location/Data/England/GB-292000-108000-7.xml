		<title>07A DAIRY FARMER'S DAY</title>
		<content> Arise at 5.30 to fetch the cows in to 
 start{milking}by 6.0. There are       
 sixty-five animals to milk and the    
 dairy to clean by 8.15, then feed the 
 calves and go for breakfast. In{winter
 the cows are all housed and fed on    
 silage - they must be bedded up and   
 cleaned out. In{summer}they go out to 
 graze. In{spring}the main tasks       
 between milkings are preparing the    
 land for growing sileage and hay, i.e.
 rolling, harrowing and fertilizing if 
 second and third crops of sileage are 
 to be taken.{Afternoon milking}begins 
 at 4.0 and should be finished by about
 6.0. Any electric fences to be moved  
 can be done in the{evening}ready for  
 the cows to strip-graze the following 
 day.
