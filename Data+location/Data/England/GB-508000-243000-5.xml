		<title>05Ecology Nature Reserve</title>
		<content> There is a nature reserve situated    
 around the Old Warden Tunnel Baulk and
 Cutting.  The old Bedford to Hitchin  
 railway line runs through the cutting 
 and tunnel in the reserve.  Most of   
 the Baulk is covered with hawthorn and
 bramble scrub with patches of rosebay 
 willowherb and thistles.              
        This attracts many birds as a  
 nesting and roosting site, including  
 big flocks of redwings and field-fares
 in the winter.  The ends of the baulk 
 show the original rough grassland with
 cowslips and hairy violet in the      
 spring.  At the south end there are a 
 few tall ashes and crab trees, much   
 favoured by bull finches.  A rich     
 flora of cowslips, hairy violet, oxeye
 daisy, spiny restharrow, salad burnet,
 pepper-saxifrage, dwarf thistle and   
 quaking-grass is to be found north of 
 the tunnel mouth.                     </content>
