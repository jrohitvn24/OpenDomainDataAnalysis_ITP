		<title>02CHANGING FACE OF OTTERTON</title>
		<content>  Otterton is in the process of        
 changing its character. At one time,  
 the{Clinton Estate}owned almost all   
 the properties in the village, but now
 they are selling them off to private  
 buyers, who make improvements and     
 often build extensions. This means    
 that the houses in the main street    
 look prettier than they used to.      
  At one time there used to be seven   
 working farms right on the main street
 each with a tenant farmer and his     
 family. Now, the land is managed from 
 the Estate Office in East Budleigh.   
 The farm-houses are now being sold  to
 private developers for conversion to  
 houses.                               
  In addition to this there are several
 small developments which are filling  
 in some of the old orchards and large 
 gardens near the village centre.
