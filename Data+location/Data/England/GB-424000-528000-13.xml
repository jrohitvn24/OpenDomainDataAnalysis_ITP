		<title>13St. JOSEPH'S R.C. SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Coundon St. Joseph's R.C. school was  
 begun in 1905 and completed in 1907.  
 At first it was an all age school from
 five to fourteen. When you were 11    
 years old you had to take a test to go
 to a grammar school. After the 1939-45
 war the leaving age went up to fifteen
 and soon there were over 250 children.
 In 1962 new classrooms and toilets    
 were built and the allotments nearby  
 were converted to a playing field. In 
 1964 a new secondary school was built 
 in Bishop Auckland and St. Joseph's   
 became an Infant and Junior School.   
 There have been seven headteachers.   
 The last was Mr. McGowan who was head 
 for 28 years. The head is now Mrs.    
 Mc.Manners. There are three teachers, 
 Mr. Sharkey, Miss Brown and Miss      
 Spellman. The school had it's Diamond 
 Jubilee in 1982.
