		<title>14A FORMER HEADMISTRESS</title>
		<content>   Living near Broadwas C.E.School is a
 former Headmistress. She took up her  
 post in January 1941 and retired in   
 August 1972.She succeeded a           
 Headmistress who had been at the      
 school since 1906!                    
     When she first came there were    
 about 40 children in the school and   
 over the years the number rose to     
 about 120 which included some 20      
 children who were evacuated from      
 Birmingham during the war period.     
 Several extentions were carried out to
 cater for this increase which was due 
 mainly to a rise in the birthrate and 
 the closure of the small school at    
 Knightwick.The school teaching staff  
 then rose to four.                    
    Most of the children came from     
 Broadwas but some travelled from      
 Knightwick and Cotheridge in a coach, 
 on bicycles and even on foot.         </content>
