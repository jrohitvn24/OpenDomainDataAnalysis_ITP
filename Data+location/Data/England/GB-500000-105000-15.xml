		<title>15Cricket in Arundel</title>
		<content>  The{Arundel cricket club}is one of   
 the oldest in the world. It is        
 situated on a 5 acre site off the A27 
 to the West of the town. It is still  
 very active, many matches being played
 by both senior and junior teams during
 the season. In the winter the club    
 house is used for social activities;  
 parties, folk club, wedding receptions
 etc. Unfortunately, recent vandalism  
 has necessitated the installation of  
 shutters and security light.          
  Arundel is famous in the world of    
 cricket, as traditionally the first   
 match of each international Test      
 cricket team visiting England is      
 played against the{Duchess of         
{Norfolk's Eleven.}This match is played
 in the castle grounds and attracts    
 large crowds.
