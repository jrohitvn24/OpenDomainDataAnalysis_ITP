		<title>07INFLUENCES: ARMY,   QUINTON</title>
		<content>   At the outbreak of war in 1939, the 
{Royal Engineers needed a large depot. 
 Although marshy then, 350 acres of    
 flat land between Long Marston and    
 Quinton was free from aerial attack   
 and already near good rail links.     
   Since that time, the{Royal Pioneer  
{Corps}has been associated with        
 creating and running the depot.Also,  
 the Alien Pioneer Battalion may       
 account for the large number of locals
 of central European origin, especially
 from Poland.                          
   As army personel have become part of
 the village, with large areas of      
 quarters adjacent to the council      
 estates, so many{civilians}have been  
 taken on for jobs{alongside servicemen
 and women.                            
   Some members of the local civilian  
 population were even decorated for    
 their Falklands War duties in 1982.   </content>
