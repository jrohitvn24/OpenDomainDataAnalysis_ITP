		<content> On the southern edge of the area      
 Victorian terraced houses contrast    
 with 1950's style council_owned       
 houses.The Victorian terrace built in 
 the 1890's is substantial and has been
 described by commentators as full of  
 character. The council houses simply  
 do not blend in with the surroundings 
 which include a Victorian cider       
 manufactory now used as a carpet      
 warehouse. The terrace houses have    
 been tastefully maintained, showing   
 their local bricks and tiles to good  
 effect.                               
 Temporary housing accomodation is to  
 be found at 298385. This is the       
 responsibility of Sedgemoor District  
 Council. Each temporary home is       
 described as 'mobile'.Residents await 
 permanent council houses to become    
 available to them.
