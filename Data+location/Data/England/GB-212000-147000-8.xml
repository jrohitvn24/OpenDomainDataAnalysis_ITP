		<title>08Grey seals (cont'd).</title>
		<content> Pupping takes place between September 
 and November on quiet, isolated       
 beaches.At birth they are about one   
 metre long and weigh 15 kilograms.Over
 the next three weeks, on a diet of    
 high-fat milk, their weight trebles.  
 During this time, the mother has not  
 eaten at all and as soon as the pup   
 reaches this size she goes off to eat 
 and leaves the pup to fend for itself 
 - it can swim by this time.           
                                       
{CONSERVATION}A seal's natural enemies 
 are killer whales and man.  There are 
 not many whales in the area, and seal 
 pups are protected by law (the Seal   
 Conservation Act of 1970) from 1 Sept 
 to 31 Dec. The pups are hunted for    
 their white fur, which lasts for two  
 weeks after birth.On Lundy the seals  
 are safe.        {Michael Hearfield }
