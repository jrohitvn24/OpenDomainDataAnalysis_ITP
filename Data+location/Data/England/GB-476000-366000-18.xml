		<title>18Moat</title>
		<content>   A{moated manor house}once stood at  
 the northern end of Weston, but all   
 traces of the building have gone.     
 Instead it is an undulating grazing   
 field, known as "Hall Yard", though   
 the depression in the land shows      
 clearly where the moat was. It is     
 approx. 10 feet wide and 8 feet deep, 
 and the island is approx. 40 paces by 
 30 paces. Between the moat and the    
 nearby stream there is a small        
 rectangular depression which may have 
 been a{fishpond,}or part of the{leat} 
 workings, controlling the water supply
 to the moat.                          
   The site is officially listed among 
 the ancient monuments of agricultural 
 and historical interest. Nothing is   
 known of the manor house that stood   
 there, but it is thought that it was  
 built before the Black Death and fell 
 into decay afterwards.                </content>
