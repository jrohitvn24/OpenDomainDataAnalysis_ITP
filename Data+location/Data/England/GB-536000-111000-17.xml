		<title>17Tumuli on South Downs Scarp</title>
		<content>  On the map of our twelve squares we  
 noticed the words tumulus and tumuli. 
 We checked in an encyclopaedia and    
 discovered these were ancient burial  
 mounds.We looked more closely at the  
 map and noticed that there were ten   
 tumuli in our squares and that they   
 were all along the top edge of the    
 Downs scarp,over-looking the valley.  
  There was other evidence to show that
 early man had lived on the Downs.Just 
 to the west of our squares,close to   
 the South Downs Way was a 'settlement'
 and to the south an Anglo-Roman field 
 system.                               
  We walked along the track from our   
 school up to Black Cap to look for the
 tumuli,but we could not see many of   
 those marked on the map.Our teacher   
 told us that in the winter,after the  
 harvest you can see the rectangular   
 outlines of the field system.         </content>
