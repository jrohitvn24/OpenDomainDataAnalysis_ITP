		<title>07A SCHOOL DAY</title>
		<content> My name is Ian Mitchell and every day 
 I get up at 7.15am and get dressed. At
 7.35am I have breakfast and after that
 at 7.55 I get washed and clean my     
 teeth. Soon after that I pack my bag  
 and by 8.15 I am ready to go to school
 by bus. I leave home at 8.35 to catch 
 Mr. Gantley's coach which leaves at   
 8.40. I arrive at school at 8.50 and  
 set up a school computer. At 9.05 we  
 have an assembly and at 9.30 we are   
 usually ready to start our work. We   
 have a playtime from 10.45 to 11.00   
 when we start work again until 12.05  
 when it is time to get ready for      
 dinner. On Wednesday we have our      
 dinner earlier because we go swimming.
 When I get home I do my homework and  
 then watch television until 5.30 when 
 dad gets home and we have our tea. I  
 go to bed at 9.15pm.
