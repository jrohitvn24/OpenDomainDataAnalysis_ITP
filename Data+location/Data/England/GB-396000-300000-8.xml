		<title>08Pets of pupils at Sneyd Sch.</title>
		<content> Out of 29 pupils in a first year form 
 at Sneyd Comprehensive School only 3  
 did not have any pets.Apart from      
 goldfish,the most popular was the cat,
 one family had 16! 10 families had at 
 least 1 cat.Dogs are also popular. 15 
 families had dogs,9 had 1 dog,6 had 2 
 dogs.Other pets included guinea pigs, 
 birds,rabbits,hamsters,terrapins and  
 tortoises.Dogs are lovable and        
 faithful if they are treated properly.
 I have got 2 King Charles Cavaliers.  
 I take my dogs daily for a run in the 
 park,their favourite game is chasing  
 after a stick.A balanced diet is      
 important as is daily grooming.Long   
 haired dogs like mine should be       
 powdered as well as brushed.Puppies   
 should receive a course of injections 
 which costs about 24 pounds to prevent
 them from catching any disease.
