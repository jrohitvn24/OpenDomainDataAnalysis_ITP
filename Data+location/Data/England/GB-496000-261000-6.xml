		<content> During the middle part of the 19th    
 century the{Duke of Bedford}owned     
 Souldrop and much of the surrounding  
 area.  In order to improve life for   
 the farm workers he built two rows of 
 small cottages in Souldrop high street
 in 1854.                              
                                       
 The larger farm{cottages}dated 1865,  
 were also built by the Duke           
 and were some of the first 3-bedroomed
 cottages with largish gardens to be   
 provided for farm workers.            
                                       
 In 1924,{Sir Albert Bowen}left Â£100   
 to many of the tenants and this was   
 more than enough for them to buy their
 own properties when the village was   
 split up into lots and sold in 1925.
