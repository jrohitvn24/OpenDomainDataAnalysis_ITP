		<title>16Mr.Owen Sivell, Liskeard</title>
		<content> Mr.Sivell,amply built and 6\ feet     
 tall, has a deep booming voice to     
 match his size;a figure well-known in 
 the area.He came to Liskeard in May   
 1934 as a Police Constable and rose to
 become Chief Inspector in the now     
 Devon and Cornwall Constabulary.      
 His first impressions were of how     
 clean and tidy the streets were and   
 the number of people that attended    
 the many chapels.The major changes he 
 has seen have been the rise in the    
 population, more public houses, more  
 vandalism and more public services. He
 feels that there is more entertainment
 for the young today. In 1967 he became
 involved in local government and has  
 been Mayor of Liskeard three times.He 
 sees Liskeard as expanding and plans  
 for the future include a new road from
 Callington,increased sports facilities
 for the young and a BMX track.        </content>
