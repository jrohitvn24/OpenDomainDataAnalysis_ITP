		<title>10GREAT BARDFIELD WATERMILL</title>
		<content>  The Great Bardfield watermill is two 
 mills in one. One of the mills is a   
 stone mill which was used for grinding
 cattle feed and the other is a roller 
 mill which was used for refining      
 flour.The oldest mill is the stone    
 mill which is 4OO years old and the   
 roller mill a 1OO years old.          
 Originally the mill wheel, the mill   
 race and the flood gates were situated
 on the outside of the stone mill. Then
 the roller mill was built which       
 enclosed them between the two mills,  
 the purpose being for the mill wheel  
 to drive both mills. When the roller  
 mill was built there was a turbine put
 underneath the mill which was used to 
 power both mills when the water level 
 dropped.The turbine is believed to    
 have been jammed by rubbish coming    
 down stream when ice carried away the 
 protective grating.                   </content>
