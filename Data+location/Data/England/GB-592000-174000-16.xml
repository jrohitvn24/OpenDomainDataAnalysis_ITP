            Between the Catamaran Club 
 and school we saw another caravan site
 and passed the Ship on Shore{Public   
{House}and the Yacht Club.             
            The pub is supposedly      
 called this because Thames Barges used
 to be run onto the beach at high tide 
 to be filled with mud at low tide. The
 mud was then taken to be used for     
 making bricks.                        
            The{landscape}now changed  
 as the houses we passed now became    
 older and terraced.                   
            The sea wall started here  
 with the{beach}on the other side. The 
 beach has stones and sand and people  
 throw{rubbish}on it as well as that   
 which is washed up by the sea - this  
 makes it untidy but it is nice to go  
 there when it is hot and the water is 
 cold.                                 </content>
