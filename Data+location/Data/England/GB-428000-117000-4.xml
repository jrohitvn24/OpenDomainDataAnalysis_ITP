		<title>04 Wellow and old residents.</title>
		<content>Wellow is a small community spread over
a wide area with no real centre.Most of
the older residents have retired from  
old family businesses like Mr.Dawkins, 
who was born into a family of          
wheelwrights, whose shop was beside a  
hardware store, where wheels for farm  
carts,forest trucks and carriages were 
built.The life style of the older      
residents has become much better than  
before because there is electricity,   
running water and sewage pipes.The old 
established residents support the      
growth of the community,but they find  
that the village life does not suit the
younger people.They seem to think that 
the bond between the villagers has     
become very thin with the arrival of   
newcomers.
