		<title>06CLEATOR MOOR SPORTS DAY</title>
		<content> Every year Cleator Moor Sports Day is 
 held at Wath Brow Hornets rugby field 
 in July. A lot of different events    
 take place on this day and it attracts
 lots of competitors from different    
 places like Workington,Carlisle and   
 Seaton.One attraction is The Fell Race
 which starts at the Sports Field, goes
 up Coppers Helmet to the top of Dent  
 then back to the Sports Field,covering
 a distance of about five or six miles.
 The Cumberland wrestling is a big     
 attraction where people from all over 
 the county compete against each other.
 Cycling is very exciting to watch but 
 is often dangerous for the cyclist and
 the spectators.One of the most popular
 events on Sports Day is Hound Trailing
 which takes place over Dent and is the
 Wath Brow trail. There are also stalls
 that sell refreshments and food.
