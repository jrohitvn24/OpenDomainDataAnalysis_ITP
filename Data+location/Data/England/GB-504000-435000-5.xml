		<title>05THE WOODMANSEY ECCENTRIC</title>
		<content>     Woodmansey's most notorious local 
 character was {Mr. Gillyat Sumner}    
 (1793-1875).  Living at number 4,     
 King Street,  it seems he had two     
 hobbies-collecting and quarreling.    
 The 'human magpie' as he was known    
 came to be involved in many law suits.
 The extent of his possessions can be  
 judged from their sale in October     
 1877.  The auction lasted three days  
 and included the sale of 5,000 oil    
 paintings and countless books and     
 manuscripts.                          
     His former dwelling can be seen   
 from the car park of the Dixon's Arms.
 Built into the wall at the side of the
 house is the fifteenth century doorway
 of Beverley's ancient{Hanshouse}.     
 Inside the garden is a stone tower    
 from St. Mary's Church,  Beverley.
