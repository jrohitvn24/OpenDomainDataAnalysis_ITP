		<title>17A day in Amy's Life</title>
		<content> I get up at 8 o'clock and have corn-  
 flakes and a cup of tea.   Before     
 school I go out and feed the lambs.   
 There are four of them - one ram, one 
 mule and two ewes.   We give them warm
 powdered milk from a baby's bottle.   
 Then we go to school.   In assembly we
 are talking about animals.  After that
 we do Maths or English in groups      
 before we go out to play.   I am in   
 Group 2 and after play we swap over.  
 Then we have dinner.   I have a packed
 lunch so I usually finish before din- 
 ner people.   On Tuesday afternoons we
 do craft (I do patchwork) followed by 
 reading and story before we go home.  
 After School I go for a ballet lesson.
 On other nights I am involved in      
 country dancing and Brownies.
