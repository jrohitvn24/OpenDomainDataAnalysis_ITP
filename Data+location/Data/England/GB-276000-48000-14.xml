		<title>14E.ALLINGTON DAIRY FARM</title>
		<content> A typical day on a dairy farm begins  
 at 6.30 when the cows come in for     
 milking. While being milked each cow  
 is fed dairy cake according to milk   
 yield.  The milk goes into glass jars 
 then through to a stainless steel bulk
 tank in the dairy.  After milking the 
 cows are turned out to grass or back  
 into the silage and cubicle house.All 
 the equipment in the milking parlour  
 is then cleaned and sterilized by     
 automatic circulation of hot water.   
 During milking a watch is kept for any
 cows needing the vet or A.I man and   
 these are kept apart from the herd.   
 Milking is repeated in the afternoon  
 or early evening. Each cow produces   
 approximately  4500 litres or more    
 during her lactation and her useful   
 milking life is about l0 years. The   
 bulk milk tankers call at each farm   
 daily to take the milk to the factory.</content>
