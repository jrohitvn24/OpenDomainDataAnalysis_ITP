		<content> Liverpool  is  home to a cosmopolitan,
 multi-racial, multi-faith society.    
 This is  best  exhibited  in  the  two
 cathedrals, which  dominate  the  city
 skyline. We decided to  find  out  how
 many different types of churches exist
 in our immediate area.                
 In a road close  to  our  school is  a
{Jewish synagogue. }Off  Aigburth Road,
 near to  Garston Docks, we  found  the
{Norwegian Seamen's Church. }Nearer  to
 the city, along Princes Park Road is a
{Greek Orthodox church,}and a{Methodist
{centre.} Along Woolton road there is a
{Welsh chapel}and  as  you approach the
 city, along Edge Lane  another  chapel
 has  now  been  converted into a{Hindu
{temple.}This is to  say nothing of the
 usual {Church  of  England }and {Roman
{Catholic}churches  which  may be found
 as in any other town or city.
