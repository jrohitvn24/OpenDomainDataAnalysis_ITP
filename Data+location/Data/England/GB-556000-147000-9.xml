		<title>09TONBRIDGE SCHOOL CHAPEL</title>
		<content>  The original Chapel of St.Augustine  
 was founded in 1859.In 1900,the found-
 ation stone for an enlarged Chapel was
 laid by the Master of the Skinners'   
 Company.This new Chapel,with a new    
 organ,was built by Rev.C.C.Tancock and
 was completed in 1909 at a cost of    
 Â£17,827.The Reredos is in memory of C.
 Lowry (Headmaster 1907-22) and Lucas  
 and David (Assistant Masters).The win-
 dows and panels on the North Side are 
 in memory of Old Tonbridgians who died
 in the South African War.There are al-
 so memorial windows on the South Side.
 The stained glass windows portray     
 Saints Andrew,Patrick,Margaret,Denis, 
 George and Christopher.The Chapel is  
 primarily used by the school,but also 
 by the Tonbridge Philharmonic Orches- 
 tra and Choir,who rehearse and per-   
 form classical music concerts there.
