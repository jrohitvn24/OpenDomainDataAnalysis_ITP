		<title>10REDCAR STEEL WORKS</title>
		<content> STEEL HOUSE is just inside the main   
 entrance for the Redcar works,(in the 
 interests of security the only        
 entrance).                            
  Redcar produces the iron which is    
 then made into steel.To do this it    
 uses a very large blast furnace(over  
 96 metres high),it can produce over   
 10000 tons of iron a day.Originaly it 
 was planned that there would be       
 another blast furnace of the same type
 next to it,it was even bought,but then
 the demand for steel dropped and the  
 bits of the second furnace still lie  
 around on the land west of steel house
  The furnace is shortly to be re-lined
 Usually the furnace must be kept to a 
 certain temperature,and is only shut  
 down once every few mounths for a day 
 or so,but every 8 years the lining of 
 the furnace must be removed and       
 replaced.this takes several mounths.  </content>
