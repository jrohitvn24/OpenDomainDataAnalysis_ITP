		<content> Living in our area are people from    
 many varied ethnic origins besides the
 indigenous population. The majority of
 famillies (83%) speak English all the 
 time, as do the children at school.   
 17% of famillies, however, use other  
 languages. Of these 4% speak no       
 English at all in the home, 12% speak 
 a mixture of English and one other    
 language, 1% use English together with
 2 other languages.                    
 The ethnic languages include          
 Punjabi,Gujerati,Israeli,Spanish,Itali
 an,Urdu,Hindi,Polish and Greek. Some  
 Indian famillies speak several        
 languages due to having lived in      
 different regions of India before     
 coming here to live. Classes in ethnic
 languages are held on Sundays (Indian)
 orevenings (Italian and Spanish). Many
 children have older brothers/sisters  
 who are learning another language.    </content>
