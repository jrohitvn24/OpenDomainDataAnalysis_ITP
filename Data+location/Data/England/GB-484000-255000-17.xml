Rev Davies was in the RAF for 30       
years, before being called to the      
Ministry                               
  He went to a college for people over 
40 years of age where he learnt to     
become a Priest                        
  He wanted to work in a Parish in the 
heart of some where like Manchester,   
but instead started as a Curate in the 
Parish of Duston near Northampton,     
before becoming the Vicar of the Church
of St. Andrews in Yardley Hastings.    
 A rural Vicar has to be able to lend  
his hand to most things in the church  
from keeping the accounts to arranging 
the rosta for the church flowers.The   
mostime consuming part of the job is   
the upkeep of the fabric of the church 
biulding.                              
 He enjoys Sundays most of all, and    
especially preaching to the people     </content>
