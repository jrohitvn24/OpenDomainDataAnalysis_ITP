		<content>One of th days in my life which was    
very enjoyable was when I was a        
bridesmaid at my cousin's wedding.     
Early in the morning I went to the hair
dressers and had my hair cut.  Then I  
went to my cousin's house and got      
cleaned up then when the time got near 
I put my bridesmaid dress on and my    
veil.  I was really scared when the    
time came to go to the church.  The car
arrived late and my cousin Judy had to 
wait for the car to arrive.  When we   
arrived at the church I saw Ross       
standing in the aisle and then the     
music started playing and the other    
bridesmaid Joyce had to hold Judy's    
dress and we walked slowly up the      
aisle.  Then the priest wedded them.   
After that we went to the reception and
that was really good.
