		<title>05HOLME FARM</title>
		<content> Holme Farm is one of the largest farms
 in the area, and covers 308 acres.    
 Most of this is cornfield, with some  
 woodland, cereal, a pea crop, oil seed
 rape, and a little grass. They also   
 have a herd of beef cattle and 13     
 suckler cows. The bulls are sold at 1 
 year old, and the rest at 2 years. 20+
 chickens run loose around the farm,   
 laying their eggs where they will. A  
 public footpath runs through the farm 
 and walkers enjoy seeing the chickens.
 The farmer feels that life is very    
 hectic, and although he is more       
 fortunate than some of his neighbours 
 in having his own drying machinery for
 the corn, maintenance of this together
 with vet's bills can be very          
 expensive.                            
 The bad weather this summer has been  
 very bad for the cereal crop, which is
 costly to grow and harvest at best.   </content>
