 the current trend in agriculture to   
 diversify from the more traditional   
 farming methods.  There is much less  
 beef, sheep have very slightly        
 increased and more corn is grown, but 
 now there is also potatoes,currants,  
 relatively new cider orchards, pig    
 units, a turkey unit and several      
 broiler sheds housing a total of      
 160000 birds.                         
 Offas dyke, runs intermittantly down  
 the west of this area, passing through
 Lyonshall park.                       
 There are some unusuall businesses in 
 the area, which offer local           
 employment,including Burgoynes Marquee
 hire firm and a British Wool marketing
 board store and grading centre.       
 Lyonshall has a very active community 
 with a large number of societies      
 meting in the village hall            </content>
