		<title>10The Toxic Legacy in Aldridge</title>
		<content> Pollution is a problem of the 1980's, 
 rivers, streams and open land are all 
 becoming spoiled by dumping or tipping
 of waste. In the West Midlands are    
 over 300 sites holding contaminated   
 chemical waste. Reports were made up  
 to 10 years ago of obnoxious waste    
 being dumped in disused mine shafts or
 quarry workings. Long term effects of 
 this hazardous waste disposal were not
 fully examined. In Aldridge the toxic 
 waste dump was at the 'Mitco Lagoon'  
 and was so full of unknown waste that 
 officials were not prepared to take   
 samples by boat. The smell and fumes  
 caused were obnoxious, giving concern 
 as a health hazard. Mitco Tip is no   
 longer used as a tip and efforts have 
 been made to fill it with solid       
 material to restore the land to local 
 community. The concern is can we      
 escape the legacy of buried chemicals.</content>
