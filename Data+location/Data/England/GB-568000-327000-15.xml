		<title>15The Sandringham Club</title>
		<content> The Club stands opposite the church in
 the village of West Newton, and was   
 provided by King Edward VII for the   
 workers of the village. It served to  
 provide the people with a place of    
 recreation.                           
                                       
 Today, the Club provides a similar but
 more extensive service. There is a    
 comfortable bar where one can sit and 
 talk while the more active can play   
 darts, snooker, or bowls on the       
 recently extended full-sized E.B.A.   
 green.                                
                                       
 The Club is run by its members and the
 committee employ a full-time steward. 
                                       
 There are no public houses on The     
 Sandringham Estate.
