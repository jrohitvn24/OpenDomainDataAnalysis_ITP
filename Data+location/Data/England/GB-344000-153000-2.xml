		<title>02CHEDDAR WOODLANDS</title>
		<content> There are many interesting woods on   
 the Mendips above Cheddar.{Cheddar    
{Wood}is very big.There is a large     
 quarry next to the Wood.In the autumn 
 most of the trees shed their leaves   
 and the odd evergreen shows up well.  
 There is a lot of wildlife living     
 there,including foxes,badgers,rabbits,
 squirrels and a few deer.Lots of wild 
 flowers grow in and on the edges of   
 the Wood which insects eat and lay    
 eggs on.Campion, wild garlic,wild     
 strawberries,gorse and bracken  are   
 some of the plants that can be seen   
 Some birds nest there.Voles,mice      
 and shrews also live in the woods.    
{Mascalls Wood}is about 11 acres.Thirty
 badgers live there.Some trees to be   
 seen are hawthorn,whitebeam,sycamore, 
 beech,lime,yew,turkey oak and         
 blackthorn.One of the prettiest       
 flowers is the wood anemone.          </content>
