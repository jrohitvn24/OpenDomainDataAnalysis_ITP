		<title>06UPPER DOVERCOURT</title>
		<content> Dovercourt has a lengthy{history,}as  
 can be seen by it's name which may be 
 based on the Old Celtic word "doer" or
 "dwrr" meaning water.It is also       
 mentioned in the original{Domesday    
{Book}as having been held by the       
 brother of Harold Godwinson,whose name
 was Ulwin.We presume that Ulwin died  
 at the Battle of Hastings but we are  
 unable to prove this.However at the   
 time of the original survey the land  
 had been given to the DE Vere family, 
 and was held to be worth the princely 
 sum of 12 pounds per annum.An         
 interesting piece of{local history.   
  Today Upper Dovercourt is made up    
 largely of{housing}with an expanding  
 new estate.It is separated from       
 Parkeston by the Ramsey River and the 
 Upper Dovercourt{by-pass}designed to  
 take the heavy ferry traffic away from
 the town.                             </content>
