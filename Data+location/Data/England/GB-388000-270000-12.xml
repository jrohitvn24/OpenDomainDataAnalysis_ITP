		<content>    Lunnon cottage was built in the    
 middle of the 16th. Century and was a 
 traditional two room cottage with a   
 central passage and a loft. Lunnon is 
 a corruption of London and the area of
 the parish of Rushock is known as     
 Little London. This name is used for a
 pocket of population away from the    
 main settlement.                      
 The owners of Lunnon cottage are      
 considered 'newcomers' within the     
 parish because they have only been    
 resident since September 1981.        
 Although the cottage was inhabited    
 they have installed a damp course,    
 rewired it and added central heating. 
 The cottage is now an idyllic black   
 and white one, surrounded by a        
 beautiful garden which contains many  
 shrubs, a pool and a small area of    
 mixed woodland.
