		<content>The area is of a rural nature and      
includes the Southern portion of Barby 
and the Eastern portion of Willoughby. 
The A45 cuts across the South West     
corner of the D-block and the Oxford   
Canal runs along the Western boundary. 
                                       
The landscape is of gently undulating  
hills dotted here and there with red   
brick farm buildings.  Fine examples of
strip and furrow cultivation can be    
seen throughout.                       
                                       
To the East of Barby an ornamental lake
is surrounded by Ashby House Wood      
formerly part of the estate of Lord    
Wimbourne of Ashby St. Ledgers.  Public
footpaths take the visitor around the  
outskirts of the wood.  An extensive   
area of Parkland to the South and East 
is increasingly being used for arable  
farming.                               </content>
