		<title>16COURT GRANGE R.N.I.D.</title>
		<content> Court Grange is a huge house once     
 belonging to Captain and Mrs Hare.    
 Sadly Captain Hare was drowned whilst 
 commanding H.M.S Eurydice in 1843.    
 In memory of her husband Mrs Hare     
 raised Â£1609 for the church. Court    
 Grange was given to the Royal National
 Institute for the Blind.The house     
 has 28 bedrooms and would probably    
 accommodate nearly a hundred children.
 Now it is used for deaf and dumb      
 students.Most of the children who go  
 there are boys.The age range is 16-22 
 years.Boys play sporting games like   
 football.Recently a swimming pool has 
 been built in the garden.We rang up   
 the secretary of Court Grange and     
 asked her a few questions.33 students 
 go there and yet 40 staff are needed. 
 Although no new buildings are being   
 built a number of buildings are being 
 changed.30-40 pupils go to the Grange.</content>
