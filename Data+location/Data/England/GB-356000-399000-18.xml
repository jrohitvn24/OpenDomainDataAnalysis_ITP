		<title>18LOCAL GIRLS GAMES IN A-IN-M</title>
		<content> We play lots of games in our freetime 
 such as {Scarecrow Tick,Normal        
{Tick,Chinese Skipping,}and lots of    
 others.Scarecrow Tick is were somebody
 is "up",and when they "tick" (touch), 
 they have to stand with their arms and
 legs apart,they are freed by someone  
 passing under their arms or legs.     
 Another  game which is popular is     
 hopscotch but the slightly younger    
 children play it.We play a game called
 'Leggit' where somebody throws a ball 
 and if the person they throw it too   
 does not catch it everbody runs       
 away.They shout and then try to hit   
 the person who is nearest with the    
 ball.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
