		<content> The River Derwent can only be crossed 
 by road at Cromford Bridge and Matlock
 Bridge(16th century).Most road traffic
 has to follow the A6 through the gorge
 This leads to traffic jams at busy    
 periods.A narrower road,liable to sub-
 sidence, runs over the hill from      
 Cromford to Matlock Green.At weekends 
 Matlock Bath,a tourist centre,is      
 visited by many motor-cyclists. Bus   
 services from Matlock pass along the  
 A6 to Cromford and other villages.They
 also come from Manchester and the N.W.
 to Derby, Nottingham and the M1. The  
 A6 follows the valley floor of the R. 
 Derwent,roads on either side involve  
 steep hill climbs. The British Rail   
 branch line from Ambergate to Matlock 
 follows the valley by using two       
 bridges and twom tunnels.There are    
 stations at Cromford and Matlock Bath.
