		<title>17LEEDS ROADS SHOPS (CONT.)</title>
		<content> It is  hard to maintain a good level  
 of business.Trade is not consistent   
 and at some times in the year it is   
 poor.Disaster struck the wine shops   
 when last year a lorry carrying cattle
 careered through the shop front.Many  
 customers went to other off-licences  
 in the meantime and even though the   
 shop has been fully restored trade is 
 not very brisk.There are some         
 excellent shops on the parade and many
 local inhabitants admitted that they  
 preferred shopping there than going to
 the nearby town centre.Ingles the     
 grocers provides a wide choice of     
 fruit and vegetables and some exotic  
 lines.There are two exclusive mens and
 womens boutiques next to each other   
 which stock the latest fashions.      
 Parking is bad because cars have to   
 park at angles.
