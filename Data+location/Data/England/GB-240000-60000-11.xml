		<content> Off Ground IT.First somebody gets     
 picked to be IT.Then all the others   
 get a chance to run away.When they've 
 run away the person who's IT chases   
 them.Anything that is Off Ground is   
 Home.Off Ground means anywhere you    
 can stand not on the ground,like on a 
 stone,a raised kerb,window ledge,or a 
 drain cover,etc. You are not allowed  
 to stay on the same Home for too long.
 If IT touches you when you are running
 between Homes you become IT.          
 Cat and Mouse.First everyone stands   
 against a wall and two teams, a Home, 
 and a Prison are chosen.One team are  
 the Cats and the other the Mice.Then  
 the Mice get ten seconds to run away  
 before the Cats chase them and try to 
 put them in the Prison.Mice cannot be 
 caught in their Home,once caught can  
 be rescued by free Mice touching them.
 Change round when all Mice are caught.</content>
