		<content> Great Easton is made up of old and    
 new houses .Many of the older houses  
 were built around 135 years ago which 
 was when the Maynard Estate was       
 built.The Maynard family of Easton    
 Lodge owned most of the land around   
 the area.They are red brick houses.   
 There are 89 houses in Great Easton;34

 and 9 bungalows.                      
 The oldest house belongs to Mary      
 Blakey.It is at the bottom of the hill
 and is 600 years old.It has a wooden  
 frame with plaster.It has two rooms   
 either side up and down.In the middle 
 it had a central hall which was open  
 to the roof.Now there is a floor there

 Opposite the church there is a flint  
 cottage which was built in 1822. It   
 has a quern,over the door,to keep out
