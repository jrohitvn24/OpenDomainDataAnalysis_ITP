 WE PLAY "TIG".SOMEONE IS"IT" AND HE   
 CHASES THE OTHER PEOPLE.IF HE         
 TIGS&lt;TOUCHES>ONE OF THEM THAT PERSON  
 IS "IT".                              
 IN "BULLDOG" SOME BODY IS IN THE      
 MIDDLE OF TWO PARALLEL LINES AND THE  
 CHILDREN TRY TO CROSS THEM. THE ONE   
 IN THE MIDDLE TRIES TO CATCH SOMEONE, 
 THEN THEY BOTH CATCH, AND SO ON UNTIL 
 THERE IS NO ONE LEFT.                 
 I LIKE PLAYING "MYSTERY MAZE". YOU    
 HAVE A LITTLE BALL ON A BOARD AND YOU 
 PUT IT IN THE FIRST HOLE WHICH SAYS   
 "WAY-IN".FOLLOW THE COLOURED LINES TO 
 FIND THE WAY OUT. SOMETIMES YOU CAN   
 TAKE SHORT-CUTS.                      
 I LIKE PLAYING WITH A HOOP. I CAN ROLL
 IT AND SOMETIMES RUN THROUGH IT,AND I 
 CAN THROW IT SO THAT IT COMES BACK TO 
 ME.                                   
                                       </content>
