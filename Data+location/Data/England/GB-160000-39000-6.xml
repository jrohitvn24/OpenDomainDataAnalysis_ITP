		<content> Peppers are grown in similar ways.    
   Most of the research with flowers is
 concerned with bulb plants although   
 there are a series of experiments in  
 progress at the moment with varieties 
 of show pinks.The station has a       
 collection of old daffodil varieties  
 and has been breeding early blooms the
 most recent of which is "Tamara"-a    
 virus-free strain. Much work is also  
 done on lilies, anenomes and narcissi.
 Since high winds are often a problem  
 in the South-West, much of the work at
 Rosewarne is concerned with shelter   
 hedges and trees. Many different types
 are grown and their efficiency is     
 tested constantly.Daily weather       
 records are kept and all research work
 is published in papers and annuals    
 reviews.The station has regular open  
 days for the public to see the        
 interesting work involved.            </content>
