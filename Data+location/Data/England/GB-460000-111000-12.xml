		<title>12EMPLOYMENT IN NEWTOWN AREA</title>
		<content> There are very few opportunities for  
 employment, most of the farmers and   
 businesses, including the shop are    
 worked by the family with perhaps one 
 employee and part-time seasonal help. 
 Two exceptions are (a) The Meon Valley
 Nurseries where Mr.Gamblin employs    
 local labour at peak times in the     
 production of 130,000 plants,grown    
 under 1,600 sq.ft. of heated glass and
 sold to local shops, garden centres   
 and in London.(b) Newtown Garage uses 
 several mechanics and a petrol pump   
 attendant. However the majority of    
 people are professional. A question   
 asked to newcomers is "Are you Naval, 
 a teacher or at I.B.M.?"  Our small   
 survey confirmed this and showed that 
 many mothers  with a profession       
 return to work when their children are
 of school age.                        
                                       </content>
