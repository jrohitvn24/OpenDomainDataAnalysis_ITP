 grass land with many   deciduous      
 trees.The drainage system runs in a   
 southerly direction towards the River 
 Severn.There are also many orchards.  
 Most of the farms in the area         
 are cattle farms,some producing milk  
 and some beef.                        
     There are two churches in the     
 area;one is Methodist and the other   
 Anglican.                             
     The A40 is the only main road;it  
 runs through Huntley to Ross and      
 Gloucester.

 around this area who are always       
 willing to help you when needed.
