		<title>01Dalton Holme and Thorpe</title>
		<content> This area is dominaed in the west by  
 Dalton Parkand its associated woodland
 but from any angle and indeed many    
 miles away the spire of Dalton Holme  
 Church rising to 210 feet can be seen.
 The church replaced pre=Norman        
 buildings in 1860, though the         
 deconcecrated shell of that at Holme  
 remains.  Further east across the     
 flatter land with many woods lies     
 Thorpe, once an important village but 
 now mainly thought of as Lockington,  
 its immediate neighbour.  The former  
 strategic position of the area on the 
 edge of the River Hull marsh is marked
 with a Norman Motte and Bailey at Hall
 Garth alongside the Jacobean Manor;   
 its purposeto control the main road   
 North along the marsh side which is   
 now mostly a footpath only within the 
 block.                                
                                       </content>
