		<content> IN DONCASTER THERE ARE THREE NIGHT    
 CLUBS WHICH WE VISITED.  THEY ARE     
 "MAINLINE", "ROTTERS" AND "SEVENTH    
 HEAVEN".                              
 "SEVENTH HEAVEN" IS A TYPICAL EXAMPLE 
 AND IS SO CALLED FROM THE             
 EXPRESSION "IN THE SEVENTH HEAVEN"    
 MEANING ECSTATIC.   THE BUILDING      
 INCLUDES A MAIN ROOM AND A SMALLER ONE
 CALLED "CLOUDS" WHICH IS ALSO THE NAME
 OF THE OWNER'S DOG.  THIRTY YEARS AGO 
 THE ESTABLISHMENT WAS THE CO-OP       
 BALLROOM.  WHEN IT CHANGED HANDS TWO  
 BARS WERE BUILT WHICH WERE            
 REVOLUTIONARY AT THE TIME.  THE COST  
 OF DECORATING AND CONVERSION IN 1984  
 WAS Â£550,000.                         
 SATURDAY IS THE BUSIEST NIGHT OF THE  
 WEEK BECAUSE CLIENTS DO NOT HAVE TO   
 GET UP FOR WORK THE NEXT MORNING.  THE
 MOST POPULAR DRINKS ARE LAGER AND BEER
 BUT BY LAW FOOD HAS TO BE SOLD AS WELL</content>
