<title>33A Day in the life</title>
<content>

Saturday&lt;br />&lt;br />Blaine came over for a sleepover and we watched a DVD. The film was called Paul. It was funny .  &lt;br />&lt;br />After breakfast I went to the Thames Barrier with mum, dad, Blaine and my brother when we got there I saw a climbing frame and it was fun playing on it.  Then we went in to this information room and I saw a working model of the Thames Barrier and there was a video about how the Thames Barrier worked and when the sun came out we went for a walk along the river .        &lt;br />&lt;br />Then it rained and we went to get something to eat and dropped Blaine back home.&lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
