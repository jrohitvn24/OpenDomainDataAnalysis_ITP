		<content> The area we surveyed is rural with    
 many farms and the occasional cluster 
 of houses forming a hamlet or         
 village.It is a beautiful area with   
 rounded hills giving vantage points   
 for viewing the glories of the Derby- 
 shire scenery. Most of the fields of  
 mainly mowing grass,cereals or grazing
 land are bounded by stone walls but   
 towards the eastern side hedges begin 
 to appear.There are few major roads   
 and no railway.Most of the lanes are  
 well metalled but extremely winding   
 and peaceful giving he passenger or   
 pedestrian the view of banks of wild  
 flowers and an abundance of wildlife  
 at every turn.There are a number of   
 stone quarries and mines in the       
 area but most of them are abandoned   
 and are merging back into the country-
 side-no longer a blot on the
