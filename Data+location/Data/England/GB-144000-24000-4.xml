		<content>    A lot of people that live in       
{Mousehole}work in Penzance and they   
 need{transport}to get there. Many of  
 these people use the bus sevice,also  
 some people use their car to get to   
 work.                                 
   {Mousehole}is a small country       
 village, this is why people need their
 own{transport.}The roads in the       
{Mousehole}area are very narrow and it 
 is difficult for two cars to pass.    
    It is much easier to cycle through 
{Mousehole}because a lot of people walk
 through the village.                  
    There are some steep hills in      
{Mousehole}and{Lamorna,}this is because
 both places are on the coast and as   
 you go inland the land rises steeply .
 In some places there are farms, and   
 you may find it difficult to find     
 passing place to pass a tractor or a  
 milk tanker etc.                      </content>
