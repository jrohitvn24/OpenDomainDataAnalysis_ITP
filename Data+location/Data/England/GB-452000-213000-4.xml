		<content> Islip is a compact partly local       
limestone built village of about 600   
inhabitants of whom at least 150 are   
old age pensioners.The village         
straddles the River Ray where it       
passes through a narrow valley to join 
the Cherwell.There are three farms,two 
pubs,a church,a chapel,a post          
office,one shop,and a coal merchant.A  
very big recreation ground opposite    
the church has two football pitches,a  
cricket pitch,swings and climbing      
frames and a slide for children,and a  
village hall.Nearby is Dr South's      
School where there are 42 pupils aged  
5 to 11.Over the railway line from the 
school there is the doctors' Surgery   
and Health Clinic.There used to be a   
Station,but the railway now only       
carries goods.The biggest house in the 
village is the Old Rectory built by Dr 
South in 1695.                         </content>
