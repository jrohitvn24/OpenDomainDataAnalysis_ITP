		<title>06Village High Street</title>
		<content> There is only one street through the  
 village and it is called the High     
 street.I counted the traffic for ten  
 minutes in the morning.There were only
 8 vehicles using it.It is mainly a    
 road for pedestrians.                 
   The busiest time for the village    
 street is just before school starts   
 and when school finishes.The school   
 bus comes,parents bring children in   
 cars and children are walking in the  
 street.After school and in the        
 holidays,lots of children play in the 
 street and ride their bikes there.I   
 go on the street after teatime.Boys   
 come and play football in a nearby    
 field.Girls ride bikes,play ball and  
 chat together.Grown ups visit each    
 other's houses and walk to the pubs   
 or village hall.At milking time the   
 cows walk from the fields to the farm 
 through the High street.              </content>
