		<content>  OKEFORD FITZPAINE                    
 The name of the village comes from the
 fact that the village was close to a  
 ford over the Stour within an oak     
 forest. The parish was granted to the 
 Fitzpaine family in mediaeval times.  
 The parish has also been known as     
 "Fippenny Ockford" and "Ad Ford"(in   
 the Domesday Survey of 1086).         
                                       
 The village appears to have grown     
 along an old trackway running between 
 Shaftesbury and Dorchester. There are 
 prehistoric earthworks on Okeford Hill
 and Bell Hill.                        
 In mediaeval times the village was    
 quite important with its own weekly   
 market and a three day fair each year,
 both granted by Royal Charter.However,
 as Sturminster Newton grew in         
 importance in the 17th and 18th       
 centuries, so Okeford declined.       </content>
