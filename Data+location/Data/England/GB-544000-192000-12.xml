		<title>12HAINAULT FOREST</title>
		<content>   The chief keeper's name is          
 Mr.Morton. In the forest, insects     
 bother the staff alot.Shooting isn't  
 allowed. Some of their rare birds are 
 the Owl, Tiny Warbler, and the        
 Goldcrest. There are keepers to stop  
 poachers killing the animals, which   
 are the Fox, Stoat, Weasel, Rabbit,   
 Vole, Badger, Shrew, and Squirrel.    
 Squirrels and Rabbits are pests,      
 because they burrow into the golf     
 courses and they gnaw at the buds of  
 new trees.                            
                                       
   Any tresspassers get arrested. It   
 is very dark and dangerous at night.  
 Lots of people fish in the six ponds, 
 and very recently someone has even    
 drowned. Some people have become      
 lost in the woods.                    
                                       
                                       </content>
