		<title>03WETHERBY COUNCIL 1 structure</title>
		<content> The Wetherby area is a Ward within    
 Leeds City, which in turn is part of  
 the West Yorkshire Metropolitan       
 Authority. The council offices were   
 built in 1936 and extended in 1966.   
 There are 6 departments with a total  
 workforce of 32; less than half of    
 these live in Wetherby, the rest      
 travel from nearby villages, Harrogate
 or Leeds. The busiest department is   
{Administration,}which is led by the   
 Area Office Manager. It provides      
 clerical and typing support for the   
 other departments as well as manning  
 the switchboard and reception. Rentals
 are also collected from the stall     
 holders of Wetherby Market. The       
{Cleansing}department garages are on   
 Hallfield Lane but an inspector calls 
 at the main offices for reports and   
 complaints.                           
                                       </content>
