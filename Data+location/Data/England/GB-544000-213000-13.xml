		<content>  The first Sawbridgeworth             
 Congregational church was built in    
 1814,but in 1862 it was demolished as 
 it was irrepairable.On March 3rd 1862 
 the church committee decided to build 
 another church.In 1863 the church was 
 ready,the foundation stone was laid by
 Mr. T. Thompson of Bath.The first     
 minister was Rev.James Wood and the   
 second was Rev.Willie Dyke who in 1904
 built the Sunday school classrooms as 
 a memorial for Mr.Wood, the           
 foundation stone was laid by Samuel   
 Ryder.For children and adults today,  
 the church is very popular.The morning
 and evening services go from          
 11.00am-12.00 noon,6.30pm-7.30pm.The  
 present minister is Mr. Moore.There is
 a graveyard behind the toilets and    
 the kitchen.The church does not have a
 collection but you put your money into
 a box at the back.                    </content>
