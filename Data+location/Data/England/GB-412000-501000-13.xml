 different religions. Animals are not  
 allowed to be buried there.           
 The church in the cemetery is made out
 of stone and wood. People are brought 
 from all over the area to be buried.  
 The most expensive tomb stone is      
 Â£125.00.                              
  The cemetery was first used in 1886  
 when the graveyard of the parish      
 church of St Mary's was full up.

 David who is in charge of it used to  
 be a gardener
