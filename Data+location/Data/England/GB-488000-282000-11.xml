		<title>11GEDDINGTON PARISH CHURCH</title>
		<content>The Church of St. Mary Magdalene was   
originally built in AD 900.            
Evidence of Saxon building exists in   
the line of the steep pitched thatched 
roof over the Chancel arch and the     
infilled arched windows above the      
arches on the North side.              
In the North aisle above the Norman    
arches are traces of a Saxon arcade    
dating back to AD 950.                 
On the North wall is the King's Door by
which the Medieval Kings would enter   
the Church when staying at the Royal   
Hunting Lodge. On the floor is a brass 
commemorating John Mulso and his wife  
Joan Tresham, and an alebaster slab    
depicting Richard Tresham and his wife 
Isabel.                                
Further evidence of the Tresham Family 
is the Tudor Oak screen in the South   
aisle. The present incumbant is the    
Reverend Thomas Wolfendon.             </content>
