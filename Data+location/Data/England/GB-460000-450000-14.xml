		<content> SATURDAY.  BY JACK WETHERALL. AGED 10 
    Normally on a Saturday I wake up   
 and read a book till about 9.00am.    
 Then I get out of bed and go          
 down-stairs to watch television in my 
 pyjamas.  Normally on Saturday morning
 I like to watch "The Greatest American
 Hero".  It is a television programme  
 about a school teacher who is made    
 into a super hero against his will.   
 At lunch I have chips with something  
 and then walk to the library.  Our    
 library is in the centre of town and  
 it is here I return my books, then go 
 into the junior library.  I first look
 on the paper-back stand for a mystery 
 or a 'Doctor Who' story.  Then I go   
 and reserve a book.  My overall       
 favourites are the adventure books by 
 Willard Price.  I collect about six   
 books and return home, stopping to buy
 my weekly sweets - large quantities!  </content>
