		<content>{Manor farm in the centre of Chalton}is
{the home of Mr. Budden.}It is built on
 the site of a{13 Century building}that
 burnt down and was replaced c.14 Cent.
 by a timberframed flint and stone     
 house.Research by Mr.Budden and Prof. 
 B. Cuniliff in 1968 has shown that    
 additions and changes took place in 15
 and 16 centuries. The walls are now of
 flint or brick and are solid. A lot of
 the original sand and lime plaster is 
 still left. The original East wall is 
 now under the garden and was excavated
 in 1968. In a room that use to be the 
 kitchen,is a large Inglenook fireplace
 with large bread ovens on either side.
 In the wall of a living room Mr. John 
 Budden has exposed a 13 C. window. It 
 is like a church window with iron bars
 across it. Much{Medieval and Saxon    
{pottery has also been found both at   
{the farm and in the Village.          </content>
