		<content> The{Woodland Walk}is on the           
 Brockhampton estate that belongs to   
 the{National Trust.}As I am only just 
 across the road from there I enjoy    
 going for walks in the wood.There are 
{two}routes{red}route is one mile and  
 the{blue}one is one and a half miles  
 long.To start the walk you go through 
 a kissing gate in the stone wall and  
 then follow the blue or red arrows.You
 are now amongst all different kinds of
 trees,like{Oak,Beech,Larch and Pine   
 and many more.A wooded steep bank is  
 descended for 400 metres to a stream  
 where I like to paddle.As you climb up
 the other side you can see wildlife   
 like{Mice,Sqirrels and Rabbits}and    
 many wild flowers.At last you come to 
 a large pool witch is is named{Lawn   
{Pool}as you leave another steep bank  
 has to be to be climbed and the walk  
 is over.                              </content>
