		<content>{The Founder}                          
 The village still shows the influence 
 of Sir Arthur Liberty (d. 1917) who   
 lived in The Manor from 1892.  As Lord
 of the Manor he had the village green 
 made, and also had many trees planted 
 around the village.                   
{Succession}                           
 He was succeeded by his nephew, Ivor  
 Stewart, who took the name Stewart-   
 Liberty and was head of the family    
 until 1952, when much of the vast     
 estate was sold to meet death duties  
 and the Manor House was divided into  
 the four homes seen today.            
{The Present Day}                      
 Mr. Arthur Stewart-Liberty, Ivor's    
 son, until recently director of       
 "Liberty's of London" and the present 
 head of the family, lives at "Pipers" 
 and owns Church Farm, Home Farm and   
 Hawthorn Farm.                        </content>
