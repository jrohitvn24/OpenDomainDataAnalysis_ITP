		<title>16Keadby Pumping Station</title>
		<content> Three man-made rivers which drain a   
 large area of the Isle of Axholme     
 terminate atthe massive pumping       
 station at Keadby.The outlets run     
 under the B1392 road which runs       
 alongside the River Trent.The station 
 is maintained by the Severn Trent     
 Water Authority.It serves 37,000      
 hectares of farmland.It houses 6      
 pumps,each 152cm in diameter,which can
 pump 32 cubic metres of water per     
 second.There are 2 large exhaust fume 
 chimneys outside the station.On site  
 the maintenance man and his two       
 assistants live so they are on hand if
 a flood should occur.The rivers are   
 regularly kept clear of weeds.An      
 Anglers Association from South        
 Yorkshire holds the fishing rights.   
 In winter excess water is pumped at   
 low river from the land but in summer 
 the farmers draw on it for spraying.  </content>
