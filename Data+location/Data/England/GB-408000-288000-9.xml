<title>09No repairs, just demolition.</title>
<content>

The houses were indeed deemed defective, but they were also deemed as beyond economic repair. &lt;br />&lt;br />Hence, under the law, home owners were entitled to 95% of the resale value at the time.&lt;br />&lt;br />Council tenants were relocated, or in some cases "decanted" into other houses on the estate, while their old home was demolished and a suitable one built for them.&lt;br />&lt;br />The big problem shortly after the original domesday article was for the owners of houses which were of similar design and on the same estate (near Pype Hayes park) which were known as Dunlop houses, named after the company that originally owned them.&lt;br />&lt;br />These did not come under the same ruling, which left people in a state of limbo.&lt;br />&lt;br />I'm not sure, but I think those houses are still there.   &lt;br />
