		<title>14ROXWELL CONCRETE WORKS</title>
		<content> If you are building your own home you 
 can buy concrete direct from Readymix 
 works. You can either provide your own
 transport or hire one of their drivers
 and his lorry. The gravel comes from a
 pit nearby and they mix the gravel and
 the sand in hoppers after loading them
 onto conveyor belts. In case of       
 emergencies there are a variety of    
 safety measures which stop the        
 machinery instantly. There are a      
 variety of different sized stones     
 depending on the type of concrete you 
 need and the sand and stones are mixed
 with cement to make concrete. The     
 water is added from a separate        
 direction and the concrete is then    
 readymixed for whatever use the       
 customer requires.
