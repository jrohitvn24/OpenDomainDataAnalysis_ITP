		<title>19A LOCAL ISSUE</title>
		<content> As this block contains a long stretch 
 of coastline it is appropriate that   
 one issue often raised in the local   
 newspaper relates to the sea.         
 Frequently, especially in Summer,     
 reporters write about the sewage in   
 the sea off Herne Bay usually quoting 
 bathers who say they have seen sewage,
 or referring to areas of the front    
 which smell strongly of sewage.       
 Certainly children at school do say   
 that some areas of sea are unpleasant.
 When we asked a local Council officer 
 for his opinion it was detailed but   
 rather difficult to follow. As with so
 many issues in 1985 Britain the E.E.C.
 issues directives about contamination 
 of bathing beaches. However it appears
 that Herne B did not classify because 
 not enough bathers used it. He pointed
 out that all that smelt was not sewage
 and water samples were satisfactory.  </content>
