		<content> The area is generally very{sparsely   
{populated}with the vast majority of   
 the{land being covered by crop filled 
{fields or enclosed grazing areas}owned
 by affluent farmers.This rural picture
 is complemented by a number of woods  
 and forests,predominantly to the      
 south.                                
 Two major centres of population       
 are{two small villages:St.Ippolyts    
{and Gosmore.These two villages}almost 
 merge into one and some inhabitants   
 are still confused as to within which 
 village their properties lie.         
 Immediately to the{north of Gosmore   
{lies a wealthy suburban area leading  
{into Hitchin}itself,while to the      
 extreme south of our 4x3 kilometre    
 block lies the northern most part     
 of{Preston village.
