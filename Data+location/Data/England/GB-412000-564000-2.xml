    On the 12th March, 1985, shopping  
 in Ryton changed with the opening     
 of the first large supermarket.It was 
 opened by the{Mayor  and Mayoress of  
{Gateshead.}The supermarket was built  
 for a firm called{Presto}and seems to 
 be quite popular with local shoppers. 
    To find out what people thought we 
 questioned{100}customers and{24%      
 of these were from outside the        
 immediate Ryton area.When asked where 
 they used to shop{62%}said they used  
 to shop outside the Ryton area. Most  
 people came more than once a week and 
 most of them had walked to{Presto,    
 although{29%}had come by car and used 
{Presto's}own car-park and{11%}used    
 public transport to get to the shop   
    Before{Presto}opened there were    
 a number of small shops and a small   
 supermarket run by the{CO-OP.}        </content>
