		<content> There are many farms in our area,     
 we went to several. This one is called
 Low House Farm.The farmer took        
 us to a smelly room. He said that he  
 was immune to hayfever and cow muck.  
 He told us that he had lived there for
 30 years and the farm had been owned  
 by a person called Armstrong. In      
 answer to our second question he said 
 that the farm was about 100 years old.
 The farmer said the farm had been cut 
 in half by the motor way. On the farm 
 the workers work seven days a week,   
 their busiest day being Monday.       
{Barley, wheat, rape and grass}grow in 
 the fields. the farm owns 73 fat      
{cattle}and 80{sheep;}also 4{tractors, 
 1{harvester, a bobcat and a grass     
{cutter.}The farm is used for fat stock
 and there are 3 workers. There are 2  
 silos, one for grass and the other for
                                  corn.</content>
