 To the north of the museum the land in
 squares  92/72,73,74,75 is divided up 
 into part of the Lowtown area of      
 Bridgnorth and mainly agricultural    
 land. In squares 92/75 lies the Queens
 Parlor, a large outcrop  of sandstone 
 topped by trees many years old. The   
 tall trees cast dark shadows across   
 the fresh green grass which covers the
 damp earth and creeps to the edge of  
 the steep red rock. They are peering  
 slightly over the side,watching       
 bracken far below as it spreads across
 the field and reaches the town which  
 stretches into the distance far away. 
 These houses are all new, not like the
 old black and white houses in the area
 around the river's edge.There is a    
 maze of roads between the             
 Wolverhampton and Stourbridge main    
 roads.                                </content>
