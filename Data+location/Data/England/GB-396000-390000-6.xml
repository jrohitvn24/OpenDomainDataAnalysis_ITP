		<content> Ernocroft Wood:                       
                                       
 The large wood which is part of the   
 Etherow Country Park is mainly        
 deciduous trees, which we marked on   
 the map as item 14. When I say        
 deciduous trees I mean they lose their
 leaves in Winter. The wood is very big
 and probably contains lots of         
 wildlife. We thought this because we  
 saw some rabbits run into the wood. We
 saw most of the wood from the Glossop 
 Road and also from the road leading to
 Cote Green. I also noticed a small    
 cluster of conifers in the wood. These
 conifers were at the far side of the  
 wood. I saw that some of the trees    
 didn't have any leaves yet but I don't
 know why.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
