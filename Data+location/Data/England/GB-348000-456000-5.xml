		<content> 2500 students live in the University  
 of Lancaster. 2000 are undergraduates 
 500 are postgraduates. The students'  
 rooms are very small most of them can 
 only hold a wardrobe, bed &amp; desk. The 
 1st years have first choice of a room 
 in one of the 8 colleges &amp; most 3rd   
 years can live in if they wish. They  
 have to share kitchens and bathrooms  
 with up to 20 other students. Students
 who do not live in the university     
 usually stay in holiday accomodation  
 in Lancaster or Morecambe. Married    
 students with families tend to live in
 the country areas. At the university  
 there is a creche for the students'   
 babies and small children. Some post  
 graduate courses run for 12 months    
 from one September to another without 
 holidays. Many foreign families stay  
 the full 3 years as it is too far to  
 go home                               </content>
