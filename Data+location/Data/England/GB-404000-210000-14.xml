		<title>14A NEW HOUSE IN THE VILLAGE</title>
		<content> "About two years ago my Mum and Dad   
 put in plans to the local planning    
 department for a house on our four    
 acre field.They were not accepted so  
 after along time they put it to appeal
 and were told yes,so we could begin.  
 The land is an landslide(the landslide
 was in the ice-age)so we had to ask   
 geologist he said yes so we began.We  
 had to have metal bars in the ground  
 to make it stronger.  Chelnor Building
 Ltd built the shell of the house then 
 we built the roof on ourselves.We put 
 the felt then the batterns then the   
 tiles then the lead around the        
 chimneys.   At last we started on     
 the inside.We had to get some-one in  
 to do plastering then we did the      
 floors.We put this black paint-like   
 thing on,then we put blue plastic on, 
 and floor boards. by  Juliet Burridge
