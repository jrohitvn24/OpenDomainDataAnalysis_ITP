 the middle of our squares and is a    
 quiet village surrounded by forest    
 .The Forest of Dean is managed by the 
 Forestry Commission and is a mixture  
 of decidous and coniferous trees      
 .Large areas are regularly felled ,   
 harvested and re_planted .In 1981 the 
 area around Parkend School was clear  
 _felled .The school children were     
 invited by the Forestry Commission to 
 help re_plant the areas bordering the 
 school with a variety of decidous     
 trees e.g. Oaks, Ash Beech and        
 Elm.The area has many visitors to     
 marvel at the abundance of wildlife
