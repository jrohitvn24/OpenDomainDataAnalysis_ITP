		<title>18COLYTON IN WORLD WAR 2</title>
		<content>     In 1945 Colyton was a small       
 village,mainly surrounded by pasture  
 land.There were about 5 general       
 stores,a bank and a doctor, who       
 operated in Colyford as well.         
     During the war,lots of young men  
 from Colyton went away to fight. Those
 who didn't go formed a big Home Guard 
 in case of attack.                    
     Colyton was bombed only once,this 
 was done when quite a few Incendary   
 bombs were dropped on the Station     
 House.They caught fire to hay bales   
 and lit up the whole valley.          
     On V.E.Day they lit a huge fire   
 outside the Colcombe Castle,to        
 celebrate,but men had to watch it all 
 night because there were oil tanks    
 over the road.They lit this to        
 welcombe their boys home.
