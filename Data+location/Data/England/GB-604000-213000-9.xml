		<content> In a survey of visitors to the Cudmore
 Grove Country Park,98% of those       
 interviewed were walking their        
 dog.The other people came to look     
 at  wildlife.Most of the people       
 interviewed were local and found it   
 easy to get to the country park.Others
 thought it could be better            
 sign-posted.The sign-posts do not at  
 present name it as a Country Park.Some
 people also complained about the      
 general condition of the roads.       
   From the interviews a number of     
 improvements were suggested:          
 1 The access road could be asphalted. 
 2 More refreshment facilities were    
 needed.                               
 3 A childrens play area would         
 encourage families to come to the park
 4 Warning signs were required on the  
 cliffs.                               
 5 The park should be enlarged.        </content>
