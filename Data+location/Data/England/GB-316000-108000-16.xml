		<title>16SMEATHARPE - RURAL POVERTY</title>
		<content> As there is no industry in rural areas
 there is no competition for labour.   
 Thus those working in the country, be 
 it in agriculture etc. are generally  
 poorly paid.                          
 There is no local housing in this area
 or privately rented accomodation.  If 
 a lowly paid worker has to leave his  
 home, e.g. tied house, often he cannot
 afford to buy a house locally.        
 Another burden on low-paid people     
 living in the country is the necessity
 of owning a car, of whatever vintage. 
 To-day the Road Fund Tax is Â£1OO per  
 year, as is the average insurance.    
 Petrol is around Â£2 per gallon (4.5   
 litres).  Repair costs in a garage are
 high as is depreciation in the selling
 price of the vehicle.
