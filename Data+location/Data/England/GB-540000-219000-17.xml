		<title>17The Blacksmith</title>
		<content>   The village Blacksmith Mr.Charles   
 Page died in 1982.                    
   His daughter,Jean Page, still lives 
 in the cottage adjoining the smithy.  
 Jean Page is the Chairman of the      
 Parish Council and was interviewed    
 by a group of children, who she had   
 invited to visit her home.She is a    
 teacher, not at St.Andrew's.She told  
 them all about her father's life.     
   The smithy has been in the Page     
 family since 1811 and possibly longer.
 Charles Page worked very hard and     
 travelled around quite a lot,covering 
 an area between Newport and Nazeing.  
 Right up until he retired he was kept 
 busy,due to the revival in horse      
 riding.He had as many as 60 horses to 
 shoe in Hadham alone.                 
   Miss Page is converting the Smithy  
 into a museum of the blacksmith trade 
 and this work is still in progress.   </content>
