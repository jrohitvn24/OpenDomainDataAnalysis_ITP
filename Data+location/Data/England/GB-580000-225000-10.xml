		<content> The area around here is full of       
 wildlife.  In the woodland area fallow
 and muntjac deer can be found, which  
 originally escaped from large country 
 parks. They now roam freely over      
 farmland causing a lot of destruction 
 to both crops and young trees.        
 The farmer encourages game birds such 
 as pheasants and partridges by leaving
 grain for food and providing plenty of
 ground cover in the woodland areas for
 nesting. The shoots take place in the 
 winter months.                        
 The Essex Hunt usually visits each    
 village during the winter, fox        
 hunting. Unfortunately a lot of our   
 rabbits still suffer from the killer  
 disease myxomatosis.                  
 Almost all the old hedgerows are left 
 intact and they in themselves shelter 
 an abundance of plant and animal life.
