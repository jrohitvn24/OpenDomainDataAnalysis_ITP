 centre for the Women's Institute. In  
 1984 the building was bought by the

 the early ecumenical church. It now   
 belongs to the group of{Oriental}     
{Orthodox Churches.}The Coptic Church  
 in Hampton serves the whole of the    
 West Midlands and is the only Coptic  
 Church in England outside London.     </content>
