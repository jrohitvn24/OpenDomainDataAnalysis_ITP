		<content>  Families seem equally divided as to  
 whether they eat their main meal at   
 midday or in the evening. As most     
 households produce at least some of   
 their own food, vegetables are varied 
 and plentiful, though few people now  
 keep chickens.                        
  Microwave ovens are gaining in       
 popularity nationally but not in this 
 area. As gardens are good sized, many 
 families have at least one cat or dog.
 Most people tend to stay in or near   
 their homes in the evenings, as the   
 area is too far away from the towns   
 and there is no public transport so   
 television is the main pasttime.      
  There are no hotels or restaurants in
 the area. The only public house is    
 the Badger &amp; Honeyjar, formerly the   
 Racehorse, at Coutershaw - a one bar  
 pub serving real ale. Outside is a    
 good children's play area             </content>
