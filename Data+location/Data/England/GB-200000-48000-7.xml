		<title>07Tourism around Porthpean</title>
		<content> I have chosen to do this subject for  
 two reasons.One because my mum does   
 bed and breakfast and two because     
 Cornwall is well known for holiday    
 makers.What attracts holiday makers   
 are the golden beaches,beautiful      
 countryside and the light-hearted     
 friendly people.In the particular area
 I have been told to write about there 
 are many holiday camps,caravan sites  
 and beaches.Most of the area is       
 scattered with coastal paths,woods    
 winding country lanes,farms and       
 beaches.There are many tourists who   
 visit Porthpean beach,just down the   
 road from me,sometimes crowding it.If 
 tourists visit this beach in the      
 Winter or early Spring they would     
 think it a horrible beach because of  
 all the seaweed brought onto the beach
 in bad weather from the reef running  
 across the beach about 100 yards out. </content>
