		<content>  Rev.J.Binns of Christchurch, Sheen,  
 told us there are 7 Christian churches
 in our part of the Parish - 3         
 Anglican, 1 RC, 1 Baptist, 1 United   
 Reformed and 1 Plymouth Brethren.     
 There are no non-Christian groups     
 substantial enough to warrant places  
 of worship, though there is a         
 synagogue in Richmond. Christchurch   
 has an average Sunday attendance of   
 200 - quite good, and slightly up on  
 the 1960s.                            
  The Christian clergy meet monthly for
 discussions and prayer. Churches also 
 cooperate on social projects (cf.{FISH
 scheme) and the Churches Housing      
 Trust. 18% of the C.of E. Sunday      
 collection goes to charities at home  
 and abroad - 18,000 pounds last year. 
  Members are active in charities,     
 political lobbying, CND etc. Plan     
 to house needy in old Mortlake school.</content>
