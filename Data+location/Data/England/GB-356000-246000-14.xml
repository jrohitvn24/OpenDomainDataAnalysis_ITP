		<content> This church consists of a nave, a     
 chancel, a small recess and a tower   
 with four bells.  The church has a    
 service every Sunday, which is fairly 
 unusual for such a small community.   
 The services are taken by a retired   
 member of the clergy who looks after  
 two parishes.  Christenings, funerals 
 and weddings take place quite         
 regularly.  Burials in the churchyard 
 are now allowed only if the deceased  
 has some connection with the parish,  
 to prevent overcrowding as space has  
 now become limited.
