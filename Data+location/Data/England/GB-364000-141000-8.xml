		<title>08THE COUNTRY DANCE FESTIVAL</title>
		<content> The country dance festival is held at 
{Wells}on the{third Saturday of June   
 but this year it was held on June     
 22nd. As it was raining very heavily  
 when we got there the festival was    
 cancelled. If it hadn't been, we would
 have met at{St. Cuthbert's Church}and 
 at 2 o'clock would have left the      
 church yard to march up{Wells}High    
 Street to the{Cathedral Green.}The    
 police would have to stop the traffic.
 There are usually about 15 dances     
 altogether with some sword dances. We 
 wear costumes which were new this     
 year. They were green socks, cream    
 trousers which came down to the knees 
 for the boys, cream coloured shirts,  
 green velvet waistcoats, a belt and   
 black daps.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
