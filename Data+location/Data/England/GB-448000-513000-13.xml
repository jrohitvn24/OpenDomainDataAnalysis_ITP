		<title>13Stainton Parish Church</title>
		<content>   Last year we went to look at{       
{Stainton Parish Church.}We found that 
 the church was very old. Some of the  
{stones}in the wall were of{carved     
{animals}made by the{Saxons.}Stainton  
 means{stoney farm}in Saxon.The{Vicar} 
 showed us some beautiful{silver}given 
 to the parish by{Sir William Turner}  
 who was the{Lord Mayor of London}years
 ago.{Captain Cook's parents}were{     
{married}in this church. We looked     
 around the church for some{wooden mice
 carved by the famous{Mouseman of      
{Kilburn.}We found six.                
   Outside one of the boys lay down in 
 a{stone trough.}Then the Vicar told us
 it was a{Saxon chief's coffin!}Saxon  
 men must have been very small.        
   Stainton was mentioned in the{      
{Domeday Book}as{terra Roberti Mallet,}
 the land of Robert Mallet.
