		<content>The shops in this area are extinct.    
Large supermarkets outside the area    
forced the last few small shops to     
close.  The goods did not have the     
turnover and became stale.  The shops  
could not hold the expensive range and 
choice of goods which customers        
expected.                              
Buying in huge quantities by           
supermarkets undercut the small        
shopkeepers.                           
The public houses in the area change   
ownership frequently.  One has just    
changed hands, one is under recent new 
ownership, and one has its third owner 
this year.  This pattern is            
statistically significant because the  
pattern applies to other pubs in       
adjacent areas.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
