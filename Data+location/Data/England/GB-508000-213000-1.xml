		<content>    The landscape of area 0508 0213 is 
 located 26 miles north-west of London 
 between Luton and St Albans.  It lies 
 in the valley of the River Ver on the 
 southern slope of the Chiltern Hills  
 It is mainly countryside but contains 
 the extreme north-west tip of         
 Harpenden and the eastern half of     
 Flamstead village.  It is bisected by 
 two major transport routes: A5 and M1.
    Although outside the London        
 Greenbelt it is an area of greenwedge 
 preventing the building of too many   
 houses which would cause Luton and St 
 Albans to become a continuous built up
 area.                                 
    Originally the area would have been
 covered in mixed deciduous forest,    
 today there are small patches of      
 planted woodland but the main         
 impression is of arable farming.
