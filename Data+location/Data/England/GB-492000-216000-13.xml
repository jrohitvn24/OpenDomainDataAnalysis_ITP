		<content>The Roffs own 140 acres of farmland.   
Also they own 3 tractors,a hay turner, 
two hay bailers,a muck spreader and a  
weed sprayer.They also own 170 ewes,7  
rams,and 250 lambs,200 cattle,and 7    
nurse cows and 1 dog.They own chickens 
but they are bantoms.They get the      
turkeys for christmas in July.The      
sheeps fly dipping starts in June and  
the sheep scab dipping is in July and  
one in september.The rams and ewes are 
kept in different fields so the        
farmer  knows when the lambs are to    
arrive.The house used to have a moat   
around and it has a well in the garden.
They moved to the farm in 1956 and the 
farmer gets up at quarter past six to  
feed the animals because,the animals   
have to be fed every day.The cattle    
and sheep are sold at Tring cattle     
market to be sold to butchers and other
people.                                </content>
