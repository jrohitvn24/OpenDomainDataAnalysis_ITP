		<title>04 GREEN FARM, cont.</title>
		<content>for winter feed.Mr.Childs was born     
locally and moved to the farm with his 
parents when aged 2.He and his son are 
now in partnership.The population of   
Rockhampton is over 100 and the village
has many social activities.There is    
Mothers Union, Youth Club, Bingo. The  
cricket team plays on the village green
outside the farm and there is an annual
summer fete here as well.The Childs    
have a Guy Fawkes bonfire every year   
which villagers and outsiders attend.  
The main local schools are Castle,     
St.Mary's and Manor Brook.The community
is not increasing because of the high  
price of property and the difficulty to
obtain planning permission.Local       
property prices are high because       
professional people from Bristol are   
commuting to work while locals have    
been forced to buy cheaper property on 
Thornbury housing estates.             </content>
