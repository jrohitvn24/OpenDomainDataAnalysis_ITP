		<title>13INDUSTRY, TILE WORKS</title>
		<content> The{ Warner} family founded a tile    
 works in Star Lane, Knowl Hill, over  
 100 years ago. Houses for their       
 workers were built, using tiles       
 produced at the factory, on the Bath  
 Road. These are now privately owned.  
 The business stayed in the family     
 until {March 1985} when it was bought 
 by {IBSTOCK BUILDING PRODUCTS.}       
                                       
 The new company is to be called       
{     IBSTOCK WARNER LTD}              
 The business is valued at Â£5.5 million
 and has an annual turnover of Â£1.5m.  
                                       
 Ibstock  produces facing bricks at its
 other works. It is intended to        
 increase production at the Star Lane  
 works and re-introduce some of the old
 techniques in the production of more  
 complicated tiles. Some new equipment 
 will be computer controlled.          </content>
