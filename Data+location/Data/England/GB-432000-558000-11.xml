		<content>                                       
 Hylton Castle stands majesticlly in   
 its own grounds beside the junction of
 the Craigavon and Washington roads. It
 is in the care of the Historic        
 Buildings and Monuments Commission.   
 It was built by Sir William Hylton    
 about the year 1400 and is shaped like
 an enormous gatehouse.  It was much   
 altered in the 1860's and transformed 
 into a suburban villa.  However these 
 parts have been removed and only the  
 gatehouse and ruined chapel remain.   
 Many parties of schoolchildren visit  
 the castle which is open to the public
 all year round.  Admission for        
 schoolchildren is free.  Visitors come
 from all over the world, notably      
 America when those who have the       
 surname Hylton may trace their        
 ancestory.  Souvenirs are on sale.  A 
 custodian is employed to help visitors</content>
