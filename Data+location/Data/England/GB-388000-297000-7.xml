		<content>   survey of employment was done in our
class at St Peter's School.It showed   
that nearly every parent does a        
different job.There are some with      
simple jobs such as cleaners and others
such as company directors.The most     
common job was being a secretary and   
people who were self employed.The most 
unusual jobs were a vicar,a teacher and
one person described as a knitter.There
were jobs such as cashiers and         
carpenters and drivers. We found out   
that lots of parents were working for  
hospitals in different ways.
