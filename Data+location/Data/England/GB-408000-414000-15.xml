		<content>    Standard Fireworks is one of only a
 few firework producers in the country.
 Over sixty million fireworks are made 
 each year and sold in this country and
 abroad.                               
    The factory covers one square mile 
 of disused quarries, well away from   
 local houses in case of accidents. The
 fireworks are made in lots of small   
 huts called danger buildings where    
 often only four people are licenced to
 work.                                 
    Some of the workers wear fireproof 
 clothing and masks. A lot of the work 
 is done by hand. Fireworks are stored 
 in large buildings called magazines.  
    Apart from importing some cardboard
 tubes, the whole manufacturing process
 is carried out on the site.           
    Nearly 500 people are employed at  
 Standard Fireworks, of whom 70% are   
 women.                                </content>
