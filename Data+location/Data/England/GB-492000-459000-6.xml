		<title>06Wetwang,Farm Animals</title>
		<content>      Most of the farms near Wetwang   
 keep small herds of animals.The       
 animals are mainly grazed on the land 
 where crops can't be grown because the
 land is not rich enough.              
      There are several flocks of sheep
 and a few herds of beef cattle.Cattle 
 for meat are not turned out so often  
 because they don't fatten.            
      Most of the farms keep a few     
 hens for white meat and eggs.         
      Dogs and cats are usually kept to
 keep the mice and rats down to an     
 acceptable level.Ferrets are sometimes
 kept to keep the wild rabbits down to 
 an acceptable level.                  
      There is alot of wildlife in     
 Wetwang and around Wetwang.If you are 
 lucky when you go on a walk you will  
 see some hares.
