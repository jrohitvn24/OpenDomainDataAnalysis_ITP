		<content>Though the village has only one shop,  
the small Post Office/General Stores,  
many of the villagers buy vegetables   
from a local smallholding.             
Various tradesmen visit regularly;     
Michael the Barber brings his van once 
a month, the Butcher comes twice a     
week, the baker/grocer who lives in the
village and calls three times a week.  
A Fish and Chip van, and a wet fish van
both visit once a week.                
Papers are delivered daily from the    
camp Post Office, and milk, from       
Seaman's dairies is delivered 6 days   
(not Sunday). The post is delivered    
twice a day, though only the older     
houses receive the second delivery.    
The Mobile Library visits fortnightly, 
and the coalman weekly.                
In the summer Decima visits local      
houses with salad ingredients.         
Until recently two tea rooms existed.  </content>
