		<content> Eastern Braintree contains churches of
 several denominations. The churches of
 England in represented by St Pauls in 
 Hay Lane. There is also a Jehovah's   
 Witness meeting room and a branch of  
 the Elim church.                      
 Braintree also has a Catholic         
 Franciscan Convent. There are only two
 Franciscan Convents in England and    
 both of them are in Essex. The Convent
 is housed in very old beautiful       
 buildings which were once owned by the
 Courtauld Family. It has magnificent  
 grounds with a pond and a river       
 running through. There are 17 nuns and
 they look after 70 old people. One nun
 has been there for 6o years. There is 
 a very special weather vane at the    
 convent which was made in 1780.
