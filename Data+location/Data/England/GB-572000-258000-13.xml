		<title>13The Lych-gate, Ousden</title>
		<content> The lych-gate at the entrance to the  
 present burial ground and chapel of St
 Barnabas was built as a war memorial. 
 Out of the 83 villagers who served in 
 the 1914-18 war 19 were killed. Their 
 names are engraved on the memorial as 
 is also the name of the one man killed
 in the world war of 1939-45 from this 
 village. The lych-gate is built of    
 locally grown oak and was erected by  
 Ousden Estate workers. It was         
 dedicated on 19th November 1922 by the
 Rev Dr Grey, vicar of St Mary's       
 church, Bury St Edmunds. The          
 inscription on the front of the       
 lych-gate is; "To the glory of God and
 in honour of the men who fell in the  
 Great War"
