		<title>17School Dinners</title>
		<content>    Our school dinners are based on a  
 five star system.The food is split up 
 inti three main categories:(protein,  
 carbohydrates and fat).To be fit and  
 healthy it is best to eat a variety of
 food from each group.                 
    Each food has its own star rating. 
 The ratings are one or two stars. The 
 main course is not star rated, it     
 includes beef casserole, cheese and   
 tomato flan,pies,sausagesand fish     
 fingers. With the main course are a   
 selection of vegetables valued at     
 either one or two stars.Chips are     
 rated at two stars as are roast       
 potatoes but others such as mashed    
 potatoes,peas,carrots,sprouts and     
 salad are valued at only one star.    
    Puddings include fruit pies, flans 
 and crumbles at two stars, biscuits,  
 fresh fruit  and drinks are one star.
