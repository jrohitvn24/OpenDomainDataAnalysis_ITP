		<content>  The golf course was laid out in the  
grounds of Chalfont Park.              
  It has a clubhouse which has strict  
club rules which all members abide by. 
The golf course covers a large amount  
of land.Both men and women are allowed 
to use the course,but only men,to our  
suprise are allowed to use the bar.The 
joining fee is 500 pounds,with 250     
pounds to pay each year.               
  The clubhouse was originally built in
an Italian garden, desiged by Edwin    
Lutyens.Three army huts nearby served  
as locker rooms and bar.               
                                       
  There are only 5 remaining holes     
which were part of the original course.
  Before the time of mowers the greens 
were mown and watered by hand.They used
a horse pulled machine,they would wear 
leather shoes to protect the grass.It  
would take 2weeks to water the grass.  </content>
