		<title>10Land Ownership in Middleton</title>
		<content> The Middleton Estate was first bought 
 by the Waterhouse Family in 1913 from 
 the Batemans. It consisted of most of 
 the village, the Hall, farms and 1600 
 acres, (later increased to 1800       
 acres). The Estate - except the Hall, 
 the amenity land and various cottages 
 - was then sold by Capt. Charles      
 Waterhouse in 1950. The farms were    
 bought by another landlord but some   
 tenants had been given the opportunity
 to buy their own farms prior to the   
 sale.                                 
 Today the land is part owner occupied,
 part tenanted by Bingham, Gregory,    
 Brocklehurst, Dale, Mycock, Chatsworth
 Estate and Davy-Thornhill.            
 In the village the houses are mainly  
 owner occupied or belong to the       
 Council or the Estate. At times there 
 have been as many as five holiday     
 homes.                                </content>
