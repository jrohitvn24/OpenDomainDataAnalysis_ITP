		<title>11WELLS SAILING CLUB - NORFOLK</title>
		<content>I belong to Wells Sailing Club. It was 
founded in 1913 and has maintained a   
steady membership ever since.          
Our fixtures are from Easter to mid    
October. The times of sailing are      
dictated strictly by the tides.        
The main fleet are Sharpies bualso have
some Enterprises and Herons as well.   
Sharpies are the fastest and with the  
right wind can travel up to 10 knots.  
The Club has the usual facilities for  
entertaining. We have hosted both the  
British and European Sharpie           
Championships, plus many local sailing 
events.                                
We have a challenge with Brancaster    
Sailing Club every year. We have won 16
times to their three times. We have a  
very good club indeed.
