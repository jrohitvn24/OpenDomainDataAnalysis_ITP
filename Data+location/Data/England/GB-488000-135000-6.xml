 PART OF THE HASLEMERE COUNCIL OF      
 CHURCHES OF WHICH THE REVEREND COX IS 
 THE CHAIRMAN.                         
  THE CONGREGATION COMES MAINLY FROM   
 HINDHEAD, BEACON HILL AND GRAYSHOTT.  
 THE CHURCH IS ALWAYS KEPT OPEN FOR    
 PEOPLE TO PRAY AND TO LOOK AROUND.    
 ABOUT 3O-4O PEOPLE COME TO A SERVICE, 
 MOST OF WHOM ARE ELDERLY OR RETIRED.A 
 COLLECTION IS TAKEN AT EVERY SERVICE.
