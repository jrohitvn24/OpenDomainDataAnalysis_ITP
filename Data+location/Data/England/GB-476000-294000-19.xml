		<title>19SLAWSTON</title>
		<content> 81 people live in{Slawston.}There are 
 two large and two small mixed farms   
 surrounding the village, as well as   
 Othorpe Manor. Apart from farmers,    
 there are two farm workers, seven     
 businessmen, three builders, an       
 electrician, a schoolteacher and      
 salesmen living in the village. Very  
 few of the villagers were born there  
 and many work outside the immediate   
 area. Slawston is almost a one street 
 village, attractive with very little  
 new building - only four new houses   
 since the war - but no shops now.     
 There is a village hall where the WI  
 meet and village activities take      
 place. The threat of having the church
 declared redundant has caused over 90%
 of the residents to try to raise      
 Â£30,000 to pay for essential repairs. 
 About eight attend the weekly service,
 although all go to the Harvest Supper.</content>
