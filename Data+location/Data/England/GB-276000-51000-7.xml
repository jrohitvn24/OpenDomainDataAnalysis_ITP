		<title>07FARMING IN HALWELL&amp;MORELEIGH</title>
		<content> Renowned for cream,famous for lamb,our
 farmers continue the traditions.  An  
 annual rainfall exceeding 125cms pa. &amp;
 over 1650 hours sunshine pa. gives the
 area a growing season in excess of 330
 days pa.-ideal for intensive grass    
 cultivation on medium loam soil.  The 
 average farm size is 230 acres,some   
 given over to barley,kale and beet for
 Winter feed.  Cattle, more beef now   
 since the introduction of milk        
 quotas,are mainly Fresian,plus Devon  
 Reds and Charolais.  Sheep are bred   
 for wool and meat.  Milk is collected 
 daily for the processing plant and    
 animals are sold at one of several    
 local markets.  There is small scale  
 vegetable growing,a ready local demand
 for free range eggs and pig breeding  
 is on the increase.  Farms are mainly 
 family affairs,with the number of     
 employees diminishing yearly.         </content>
