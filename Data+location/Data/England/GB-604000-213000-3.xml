		<title>03HOUSING IN EAST MERSEA</title>
		<content> In the village the housing stock is   
 varied in age and style but the houses
 are predominantly privately owned.From
 the census 75% of dwellings were      
 owner-occupied,11.5% were council     
 owned, 6% were tied properties and the
 rest were rented.A visual survey found
 that most of the houses were          
 detached(81%) the rest were mainly    
 semi-detached; over 80% of the houses 
 had gardens,most of which were        
 large;65% had outbuidings such as     
 sheds or greenhouses;72% had garages  
 reflecting the high car-ownership in  
 the village.                          
   Houses varied from large old        
 farmhouses and small farm-workers     
 cottages to newly-built detached      
 family homes.At Coopers' Beach there  
 are several hundred privately-owned   
 caravans and chalets used as holiday  
 homes.                                </content>
