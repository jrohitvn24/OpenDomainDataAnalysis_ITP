		<content> The area is dominated by the south    
 Downs. The steep northern slopes drop 
 down to lands which once formed the   
 medieval manor of Woolavington,       
 mentioned in the Domesday Book. The   
 greater part of the manor became      
 Lavington Park. In the nineteenth     
 century this was the estate of Samuel 
 Wilberforce, Bishop of Winchester, and
 it is now Seaford College, an         
 independent school. Lavington Park    
 runs between the villages of Duncton  
 and Graffham; at the west gate stands 
 Graffham Church. Next to Seaford      
 College is Lavington Stud Farm. At the
 top of Duncton Hill, which carries the
 road from Petworth to Chichester,     
 there is a lime quarry. Beyond that to
 the west are high grasslands and      
 woodlands, dotted with occasional     
 small farms. The South Downs Way      
 crosses the road near Littleton Farm. </content>
