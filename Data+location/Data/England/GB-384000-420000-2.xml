		<content> The cotton mills which have not been  
 converted for use in the shoe industry
 have been either sub-divided into     
 small industrial lots (largely for    
 light engineering purposes) or have   
 been demolished.                      
 With the recent nearby links to the   
 motorway network the area is becoming 
 increasingly popular as a 'commuter   
 belt' for Manchester (25 miles away), 
 and there are many small private      
 housing estates being developed to    
 accommodate this. Commuters are       
 attracted to the area by low house    
 prices, low rates, pleasant semi-rural
 surroundings and good recreational    
 facilities. Away from the ribbon      
 development along the valleys, the    
 uplands are typical Pennine moorland  
 with small hill farms specialising in 
 sheep and small dairy herds.
