		<title>08Types of Cattle on the Farm.</title>
		<content>    Mr.Weaver breeds Friesian and      
Limousin cattle on his farm at Park    
Lane,Endon.He has fifty Limousin cows  
and one prize bull valued at ten       
thousand pounds and weighing just over 
a ton.Mr.Weaver brought his first      
Limousins over from France four years  
ago.He likes this breed because they   
give an average of 7.5% more meat than 
other breeds with very little gristle. 
    The Limousins are a pedigree breed 
and they are kept outside all the year 
round.In winter they are fed on barley.
    Friesian heifers are bought and the
calves are bred.The cows are fed on    
beef mix and silage. Mr.Weaver uses the
cattle market at nearby Leek when he   
wants to buy or sell stock.He has had  
plenty of success with his cattle at   
agricultural shows,winning many prizes.
