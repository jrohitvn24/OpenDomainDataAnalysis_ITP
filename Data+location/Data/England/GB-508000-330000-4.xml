   The main industry is farming,which  
 is nowadays highly mechanised and run 
 mainly by families employing little   
 outside help.                         
   Many villagers commute to the bigger
 towns but there are places of         
 employment within Pointon Village.    
{The old vicarage,}built 1865,was,     
 until recently a nursery business.    
   There is also a flourishing{mushroom
{business}in a nearby manor house.     
{The Village Post Office:}The Post     
 Office operates from a private home   
 and is owned and run by a local farmer
 and his wife.Beside stamps they sell  
 stationary,cards,toiletries,toys,wool 
 and cigarettes.In 1861 the Post Office
 was run from the house next door.The  
 owner left to become a tailor,it was  
 then taken over by a cobbler,followed 
 by his son and now the present owners.</content>
