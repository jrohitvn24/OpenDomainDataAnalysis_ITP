		<title>19CLITHEROE GUIDES AT WADDOW</title>
		<content>    On Wednesday 26th June the Guides  
 from Edisford school went to Waddow   
 Hall to see the Light of Friendship.  
 This is what Princess Margaret gave to
 Mrs. Lambert, the Chief Commissioner  
 of North West England to pass on to   
 all the Brownies and Guides in the    
 district.                             
    We set off for Waddow Hall at 1.30 
 p.m. in Miss Lockets car. When we got 
 there one of the Guiders told us what 
 we had to do. We went into the dining 
 room to sit down while Mrs. Lambert   
 told us about the "Light", then she   
 lit all our candles from the Light of 
 Friendship. After this we all went for
 a drink and biscuit before returning  
 to school.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
