		<title>07SURVEY ON OUR HOMES.</title>
		<content> Third year children undertook a survey
 to discover what houses we lived in   
 and what they were like.              
   TYPES OF HOUSES LIVED IN.  PER CENT 
   {Detached Houses             23%    
   {Semi-detached Houses        48%    
   {Terraced Houses             16%    
   {Bungalows                   13%    
 We were not surprised to find that    
 nobody lived in flats because you     
 normally find them in cities and not  
 towns like Sheringham.                
 We also did a survey on houses' ages  
  {Built before 1850           13%     
  {Built between 1850 and 1918 13%     
    {"      "    1918 and 1939 13%     
   { "      "    1945 and 1975 25% }   
  {Built since 1975            15%     
 Some people (21%) could not find out  
 how old their houses were. 42% were   
 built of red brick, 58% of flint,     
 rough cast or painted brick.          </content>
