		<content> The Fair stays in St.Johns Chapel     
 market place from Friday to Monday.The
 dodgem cars and waltzer are very eye  
 catching to the locals . There is     
 "Hook a Duck" and a miniature train   
 for the young ones and also stalls    
 with fruit machines, space invaders   
 and target games like air guns and    
 darts.                                
   "Funday Monday" is a carnival for   
 the children. Last year there was a   
 competition between the Scouts, cubs, 
 guides, and youth clubs to see who    
 could make the best float. The cubs   
 made a farming scene and won twenty   
 five pound. A Scottish band marched   
 down Hood Street in front of the      
 floats and paraded around the field.  
 In the field there was a lot of fun   
 and games for the children to play    
 and for the older ones there was a tug
 of war competition.                   </content>
