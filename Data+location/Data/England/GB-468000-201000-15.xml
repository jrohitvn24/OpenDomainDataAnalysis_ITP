		<title>15The motorway</title>
		<content>The motorway, opened in 1973 has       
considerably reduced the flow of       
traffic through Tetsworth. A 30 minute 
count the afternoon produced the       
following figures:-                    
    Village           Motorway         
    cars       24       cars       552 
    lorries     2       lorries    282 
    vans        6       vans       162 
    coaches     1       coaches     24 
    motor bikes 1       motor bikes  6 
    bicycles    1       bicycles     0 
The older residents can remember when  
the A40 - or Old London Road - was very
busy and dangerous. The motorway may   
have reduced the volume of traffic     
through the village, but those who do  
use it often ignore the 30 m.p.h. limit
and speed through without consideration
to the safety of pedestrians and other 
road users.                            
                                       </content>
