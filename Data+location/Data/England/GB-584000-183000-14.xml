		<title>14Leigh Bakery 2</title>
		<content> When the silo is almost empty, a      
 warning bell rings. They phone up the 
 man who comes and delivers the flour. 
 The bakery is in 4 parts, the most    
 interesting part was the bread making 
 and the confectionery. The bread oven 
 can hold 240 loaves and can bake them 
 in15-20 minutes. The rack oven can    
 hold 1120 rolls and bakes them in     
 about 30 minutes. There were 3 other  
 machines, a divider, a prover and a   
 moulder. The confectionery is where   
 all kinds of cakes are made, birthday 
 cakes, wedding cakes, and novelty     
 cakes. There are engine shaped cakes. 
 There were some for Father's Day. I   
 really enjoyed my trip to the bakery.
