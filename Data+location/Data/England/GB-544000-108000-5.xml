		<content> At{Glyndebourne}some new stairs were  
 put in and where the old stairs used  
 to be a lady in blue was seen, but    
 only half of her!                     
 At{Glynde Place}the owner found a key 
 which had a label saying the Ghost    
 Room, but he cannot find a door it    
 fits.                                 
 There was a Poltergeist there too     
 so in the end a vicar came and said   
 some prayers and the Poltergeist      
 wasn't heard of again.                
 At the{Mill House}a man had lived who 
 woke every morning at four and counted
 his money. The lady living there now  
 woke up at 4 o'clock in the morning   
 when she first went to live there.    
 Also when she first went to{church}she
 automatically sat in a certain pew.   
 She found that it was the one the Mill
 House people always sat in, though she
 had not previously know that.         </content>
