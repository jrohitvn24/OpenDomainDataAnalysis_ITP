		<content> The whole area is below sea level and 
 drainage water is pumped up to rivers 
 and sluices.                          
                                       
 The land is uniformly flat and is     
 alluvial plain overlying clay.        
 There are magnificent skies with storm
 clouds seen for miles followed by     
 dramatic sunsets.                     
                                       
 The large fields, without hedges, are 
 farmed by large farming groups and    
 there are no small holders. The crops 
 are cereals, sugar beet, and cabbage. 
 No livestock. Wind blowing across the 
 fen is a common feature.              
                                       
 The people are hard working,          
 independent and resilient. Many are   
 employed on the land but a proportion 
 work in the nearby town of Kings Lynn.
