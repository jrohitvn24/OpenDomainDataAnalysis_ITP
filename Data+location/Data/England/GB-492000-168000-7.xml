		<title>07ASCOT VINEYARD</title>
		<content> Ascot Vineyard is situated on Crown   
 lands next to the Racecourse.It forms 
 part of Ascot Farm on Sunninghill     
 Park.The 4,000 vines were laid down in
 1979 and are 7 varieties of French and
 German origin.They thrive on the light
 soil of the district and the longer   
 days and lower average temperature of 
 the English Summer.The first Ascot    
 vintage (red and white wine) was      
 harvested in October 1983.They feature
 in the most prestigious hotels and    
 clubs in London and the Home Counties.
 It is believed to be the first        
 commercial vineyard established on the
 Crown Lands since Henry II who added  
 Bordeaux to his kingdom in the 12th   
 Century.
