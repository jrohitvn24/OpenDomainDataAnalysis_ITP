		<title>07Whaddon Church</title>
		<content> We walked to a big church with two    
 pulpits and a nice brass eagle for the
 bible. In Whaddon church there was a  
 font and the font was wooden with a   
 carved pigeon on top. There wwere lots
 of doors with curtains over them. I   
 have never seen such a big bible in my
 life. In one of the seats there were  
 foot rests and the to of them opens up
 and you could put things in it. The   
 bridesmaids would sit there when      
 people got married. There was some    
 detail of the church:  it said look   
 for the peacocks fighting over a piece
 of bread. It was on the pillar. And it
 said look for the peacocks' feathers  
 on the angels' wings, and it was on   
 one of the stained glass windows and  
 as you looked closer you could see    
 more of them. You could see the bell  
 strings. There were about seven       
 strings and a lovely organ.           </content>
