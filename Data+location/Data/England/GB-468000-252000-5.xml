The  mini-bus service started on       
Friday 25th May 1984 because there was 
no satisfactory public bus service for 
the people in Gayton and Tiffield. It  
is run by volunteers who also take it  
in turns to drive the bus.             
 The Minibus is owned by the Nothampton
County Council who always make sure    
that the scheme does not lose too much 
money.The United Counties Bus Company  
help with the repairs.                 
 You can only fit 12 adults or 16      
children into the bus.                 
The driver must not pick up other      
passengers on the way.
