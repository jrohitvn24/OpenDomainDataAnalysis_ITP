		<title>09Farmland in Silverdale</title>
		<content>  There is very little land in this    
 area south of Silverdale, and         
 therefore very little farming. Sheep  
 owned by several farmers are grazed on
 the marshlands. When the tides are    
 high,(twice a lunar month)the sheep   
 have to be brought off the foreshore. 
 This is quite a task because of the   
 many channels where the sheep can     
 easily hide and then be drowned by the
 incoming tide. Many are kept in a     
 disused quarry until they can be      
 allowed back.(One farmer travels from 
 Grange each day to see his sheep).    
  Dairy cows are also grazed on the    
 higher ground (Jack Scout and Heald   
 Brow) and at the foot of Warton Crag, 
 where the fields are fertile, provided
 the water level is controlled by an   
 electric pumping system.
