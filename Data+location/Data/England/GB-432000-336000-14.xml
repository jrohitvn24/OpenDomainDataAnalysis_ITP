		<title>14Housing in NW Derby, part 1</title>
		<content> Many of Derby's main residential areas
 are found in the peripheral area of   
 the City, some of them originating as 
 agricultural villages. Wherever poss- 
 ible community spirit and sense of    
 identity has been encouraged by succ- 
 essive councils, even though, grad-   
 ually, all areas have become a part of
 the City. From 1980 the City Council  
 approved a new policy for the future  
 of older houses, one of renewal and   
 improvement rather than clearance.    
 They created Housing Action Areas and 
 General Improvement Areas where owners
 are encouraged to improve their prop- 
 erty, with the aid of grants of       
 beween 60% &amp; 90% towards approved     
 costs. In the 1980's the City Council 
 is turning its attention to inner city
 areas, now that building developments 
 on the outskirts are nearing          
 completion.                           </content>
