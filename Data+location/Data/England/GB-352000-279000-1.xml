		<content> The block covers part of a low, scarp 
 like spur extending Southwest from    
 Brown Clee Hill. It is fairly level   
 along the ridge, about 240m, in West  
 and about 160m in southeast. It is    
 drained by streams cut deep and       
 generally flowing east into the Hopton
 Brook which feeds the Ledwyche Brook  
 flowing south. the only routes, lanes,
 sometiems narrow and twisting with    
 high hedgerows, run along the ridge or
 lower down, parallel,and one connects 
 the two WEst- East. The population is 
 small and dispersed with only one     
 hamlet some farms, cottages, a few new
 houses and one hall at Downton.       
 Farming is largely concerned with the 
 grazing of sheep and cattle, with some
 ploughed land mainly for cereals.
