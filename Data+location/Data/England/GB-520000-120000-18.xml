		<content> The name{Cowfold}originates from the  
 time when cattle were herded together 
 at night for safety in the locality.  
 The village has a motto - "Non nobis  
 sed communitati" which means "Not for 
 ourselves,but for the community."     
 It was a tradition in Cowfold on May  
 Day for children to make garlands     
 and go round chanting....'The First   
 of May is Garland Day so please       
 remember the garland.We don't come    
 here but once a year,so please        
 remember the garland.'They would      
 then be given a few pennies.At        
 Christmas in the past,not only were   
 carols sung,but quaint verses like    
 this one....                          
 "Today good man you are alive and     
 well.                                 
 And worth many a thousand pound.But   
 tomorrow you may be dead,and your     
 corpse lie underground."              </content>
