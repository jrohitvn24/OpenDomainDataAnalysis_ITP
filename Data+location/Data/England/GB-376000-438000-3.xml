		<title>03EMPLOYMENT IN SABDEN</title>
		<content> The majority of working people in     
 Sabden commute to towns and cities    
 outside the village.Many work in      
 Blackburn,Accrington and              
 Burnley,particularly in the Ribble    
 Cement works in Clitheroe.During a    
 survey taken by our group it was found
 that out of{100}people interviewed,{  
{60%}have worked in the village and{34%
 worked outside the village.The time of
 the survey being between{9.30am.}and {
{3.15pm.}could bias the results as     
 those who work outside the vilage     
 could not be interviewed.Most of the  
 villagers who are employed in Sabden  
 work at the furniture factory "Pendle 
 Furniture".The villagers also work in 
 various other occupations including   
 farming;printing;toolmaking;paper tube
 manufacture and assorted cottage      
 industries.  ANTONY MUSKER MATTHEW
