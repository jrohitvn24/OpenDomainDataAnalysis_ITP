 A call comes from the Vale of Evesham 
 Friends of the Earth to county farmers
 to follow the National Farmers' Union 
 code of practice for stubble burning. 
 A few farmers have stopped burning    
 stubble completely but in the absence 
 of a total ban the Home Office have   
 issued Revised Model Bye Laws making  
 it an offence for flames to cross a   
 fire break and so destroy hedges. The 
 burning of oil seed rape straw and    
 bean and pea straw is also covered.   
 The Friends of the Earth feel that    
 many uses exist for this surplus straw
 such as paper and board, fuel         
 briquettes and animal feeds and that  
 it is a disgraceful waste of resources
 to burn this straw in the open air.
