		<title>14TRANSPORT AROUND FROXFIELD 1</title>
		<content> TRAVELLING to and from the home in    
 the country is made easier for many   
 people by the operation of a          
 regular Post Office Bus service.      
 Nearly 200 Post Buses in Britain      
 which collect and deliver mail,       
 also carry fare-paying passengers     
 where there is no other public        
 transport.                            
 The first Post Bus was introduced in  
 l967 and the network is still         
 growing. Before the Post Bus there    
 was never any other service such as   
 this. Because the Post Office had to  
 make collections around Froxfield,    
 Langrish and Petersfield anyway, and  
 there is no other service in the      
 area, they decided to run their own   
 special service. The Post Bus can     
 hold up to eleven  adults, and is     
 particularly busy on market days,     
 and half day on Saturdays.            </content>
