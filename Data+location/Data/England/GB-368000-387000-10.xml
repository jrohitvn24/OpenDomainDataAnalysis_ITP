		<title>10My School Day</title>
		<content>  First thing I know on a Thursday     
 morning is the alarm ringing.I get up,
 dress and eat my breakfast.I hate     
 breakfast but my mum usually makes me 
 eat something.At school,before the    
 bell rings,we catch up with the latest
 news and then squash each other in the
 scramble in the cloakroom.We go       
 swimming on Thursday but before we go 
 we read.Are swimming teacher works us 
 very hard and I am usually whacked    
 when I get back to school.The rest of 
 the day is spent doing normal work    
 like english art or topic work. I     
 like them all.When the bell goes at   
 3.30 I am sad because I never get     
 bored at school.When I get home I     
 practice on the piano and then go to  
 piano lesson.I don't really mind going
 but it does get a bit boring at       
 times.                                
                                       </content>
