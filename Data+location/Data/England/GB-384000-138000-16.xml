		<title>16Goat-keeping 2:The Deverills</title>
		<content> The{Deverill Pedigree Herd}consists of
 4O British/Swiss cross Toggenburg     
 goats. The kids are hand-reared being 
 bottle fed from birth. The female kids
 are kept as herd replacements and the 
 male kids are sold for meat at 14-16  
 weeks, the meat tasting rather like   
 lamb. The nanny goats generally       
 produce twins, one recent male kid was
 to be kept for breeding because of his
 beautiful markings.                   
 The two present billy goats are pure  
 Toggenburg and are used to serve the  
 herd and other goats in the area. They
 are kept in a separate goathouse and  
 run, away from the milking goats.     
 The herd is treated homeopathically   
 and no antibiotics are needed.They are
 free range goats.These are beautiful  
 pedigree goats bred purely for milk   
 and meat, they are not shown.
