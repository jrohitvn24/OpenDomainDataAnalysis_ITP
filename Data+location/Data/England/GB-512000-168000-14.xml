		<title>14ST.PETER'S CHURCH W.MOLESEY</title>
		<content>   One of the most interesting         
 buildings in West Molesey is          
 St.Peter's Church.  It dates back to  
 Saxon times.  It was built of         
 plastered rubble with some small round
 flints.  It survived the Tudor period 
 but in 1843 the nave  and the chancel 
 were rebuilt in Gothic style.         
   Today only the tower dates back to  
 the Saxon period.  Behind the church  
 is a large cemetery.  This site was   
 chosen when the graveyards of the     
 Parish Church became full and could   
 hold no more bodies.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
