    The garage at Drakes Broughton has 
 been there since 1955. It is owned by{
{Mr. Millington}who has owned it for   
 five years. They sell {Gulf petrol }  
 which is 199.6p per gallon.The cars   
 that they sell are TVR and FSO makes. 
 They get approximately 130 customers a
 day and about a thousand a week. Their
 busiest day is{Christmas Eve.}There is
 not a car wash at the garage, but they
 do repairs. They employ twelve people,
 seven full time and five part time.   
     Mr. Millington says that he would 
 rather have his garage in a bigger    
 town or city, because there would be  
 more people, so that there would more 
 customers.
