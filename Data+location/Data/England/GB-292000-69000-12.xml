		<content>  The lanes in the area are narrow,    
poorly maintained or not surfaced at   
all. The hedgerows are uncut and con-  
tain a profusion of plants. There is   
much honeysuckle, bramble, foxglove and
campion among the flowering plants.    
  There was evidence of a healthy      
rabbit population with runs and burrows
hedgerows. A variety of insects were in
evidence - snails, spiders, slugs, ants
and grasshoppers were easily spotted.  
We also saw many birds - robins, black-
birds, skylarks and thurshes.          
  Apart from access to the fields the  
lanes in the area were much used by    
local people for recreation. On our    
trip we encountered people on horseback
3 times and were told that they often  
used these lanes for riding. The       
residents of the area walk their dogs  
or simply enjoy a peaceful walk around 
the lanes.                             </content>
