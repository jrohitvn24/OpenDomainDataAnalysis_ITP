		<content> All the three classses use the environ
 ment in their work and make visits to 
 places of interest.  We have Sports'  
 day in July and produce a magazine    
 collection of the pupils' work. We now
 have a Bookshop in the new Library and
 we can buy our own selection of books.
 Last year the house attached to the   
 school was redeveloped by the L.E.A.  
 and is now a classroom and library    
 downstairs and administrative offices 
 upstairs.  We are making an environ-  
 mental garden for science work near   
 the old pear tree at the back of the  
 school.  Parents come into school to  
 help us and to take us on visits. They
 hold a Sale and Coffee Evening in the 
 Autumn Term to raise money for the    
 School Fund.We always work hard for at
 least one Charity each year. When we  
 are ll years old we move to Leftwich  
 or Frodsham High Schools.             </content>
