		<content> There are one thousand acres of       
 woodland in Scarcliffe Parish.One half
 was felled in 1962 and replaced with  
 Corsican Pine.This can grow well in   
 limestone soils and is resistant to   
 the considerable air pollution.       
  The Ash Tree is the stately native   
 tree.It has a rounded crown,but the   
 lower branches curve downwards and the
 tips turn upwards.The bark is grey and
 the winter buds are black.The compound
 leaves have seven pairs of oval       
 leaflets.The purplish flowers are wind
 pollinated.It is a deciduous          
 tree.Violins,chairs,axe_handles,barrel
 s and wooden boxes are made from Ash. 
  The Pedunculate Oak is the most      
 common oak.It grows to a height of    
 thirty metres.It is recognised by long
 stalks on which the female flowers and
 acorns grow.Leaves are stemless.Buds  
 group towards the end of the twigs.   </content>
