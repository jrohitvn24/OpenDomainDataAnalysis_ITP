		<title>13Market Day in Featherstone</title>
		<content> The market has only been open for a   
 couple of years and is held all day   
 Thursday on a shopping square off the 
 main street.There are thirty stalls   
 all with white protective weatherproof
 covers.The market would look more     
 attractive if the awnings were striped
 or coloured.The stalls cover a wide   
 range of goods wet fish,bakers,clocks,
 clothing,eggs and wool.Many of the    
 stalls duplicate the local shops even 
 those around the square but all the   
 traders are pleased with level of sale
 Some traders also go to Pontefract and
 Castleford markets.In the summer it is
 difficult to get a stall.Some traders 
 say they can make more cash from one  
 day here than one in Wakefield where  
 there is a daily market.The market    
 attracts local people but is not an   
 attraction to folk outside the area.
