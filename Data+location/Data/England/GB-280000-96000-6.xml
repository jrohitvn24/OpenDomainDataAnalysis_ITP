		<content> quite fast flowing and deep in some   
 places.About half an hour before lunch
 we went on a sort of treasure hunt.We 
 went in groups of 6 and we went around
 Uton and Salmonhutch finding out the  
 answers to the questions -Chris's tent
 won!  After lunch we went on a long   
 tracking game and after that we could 
 do what we wanted. At 5.30pm we made  
 boats to sail down the river.At 8.00pm
 we had a camp fire with the           
 parents,then we had soup. After that  
 we sailed our boats and went to bed.  
 We still didn't get much sleep.       
{SUNDAY:-}                             
 At 7am Chris and Hugh went down to the
 river to see if any boats were left.  
 There were four.After breakfast we    
 went on a Sisal Trail where you follow
 a piece of string blindfolded and go  
 over water and up banks.After that we 
 packed up our tents and went home.    </content>
