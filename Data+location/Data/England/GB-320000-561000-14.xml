		<content>{HAAF NETTING.}Men meet and draw for   
 position in the line which extends at 
 right angles to the shore.  Fishing is
 done with a hand-held baulk (pole)    
 approx.17feet long.  Side poles are   
 about 3 feet long and the middle pole 
 about 6 feet. Fishermen stand up to   
 their chest in the water and move     
 inland as the tide comes in. Fish are 
 caught in the two net bags which      
 extend from the baulk.                
{PEAT CUTTING.}Peat digging rights are 
 claimed in January by the householders
 who have such a right.                
{CARNIVAL. }This takes place each June.
 A Carnival queen and attendants lead  
 a procession of imaginative floats    
 around the village to the rectory     
 garden. The queen is crowned.  A      
 trophy is awarded to the best float.  
 Villagers enjoy sideshows and tea.
