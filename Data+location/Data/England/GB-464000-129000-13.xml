		<title>13Shopping in Ropley</title>
		<content> My Mum uses our village shop,Pondside 
 Stores,to collect the milk in the     
 morning because we do not have our    
 milk delivered and we also get the    
 daily newspaper from there.Mum doesn't
 drive so it is easy for her to walk up
 to Pondside for things she forgets at 
 the big supermarket in Alton where she
 shops once a week.Dad comes home early
 from work on Thursday or Friday and we
 all (Mum,Dad,me and my two older      
 brothers)go by car to do our shopping 
 at Gateway in Alton.Pondside Stores is
 handy on a Sunday morning as it is    
 open then when all the big shops are  
 closed.Mum says it also has more time 
 to help and serve you if you need     
 something special and also the        
 shopkeeper has time to stop and talk  
 to you and you meet other people from 
 the village there.
