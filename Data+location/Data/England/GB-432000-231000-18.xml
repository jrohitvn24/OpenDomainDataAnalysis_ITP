		<title>18HOOK NORTON-LOCAL HISTORY</title>
		<content>The Hook Norton section of the Banbury/
Cheltenham railway line was last of    
all to be built because of the rocky   
hills. The station was in Austin's     
Way. There was a train called "Hook    
Norton", another "Hook Norton Manor".  
This section was opened in l887 and    
closed in l957. The people had to use  
dynamite to blow up the ironstone to   
make a path for the track. It took 4   
years to build the Hooky section. They 
had to build very big pillars which    
are made of limestone.Each stone was   
hand cut. Two men got knocked off the  
top when the crane swung round. One    
grave is in Hook Norton churchyard. The
railway's main business was the        
ironstone works. The railway was       
closed because it wasn't making money. 
There was a storm and the viaducts     
became dangerous and so the track was  
taken up in l965.                      </content>
