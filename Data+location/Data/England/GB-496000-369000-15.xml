		<content>{Lincoln  City}football team,{the Imps,
 was formed in{1883}but little is known
 about them  until{1892 }when they were
 in  9th  position  in {Division 2.}Now
 they  are in {Division 3}and play in a
 red  and white  strip. Their ground is
 called {Sincil  Bank.}The  stands  are
 St.Andrews and South Park and with the
 terraces  hold {15,000 }people. On our
 visit  we  entered  by  the  player's 
 tunnel  onto the  pitch, saw the Board
 Room  and  Press  Box, and visited the
 changing  room  which  had  a board to
 plan  the  moves  for the game. We saw
 the boot room where the player's boots
 are  looked  after by the apprentices.
 In  the  physiotherapy  room  were two
 players  having  treatment  from  Bert
 Loxley, the  physiotherapist.  The    
 captain  told  us  a {new football}was
 used  for {each  game }and cost around
{Â£100.                                 </content>
