		<title>20EXPLORERS AT BERE FERRERS</title>
		<content>   By now, our Domesday Project is not 
 so much a project but more a way of   
 life. It has been an enjoyable way of 
 life -hard work,but enjoyable. We have
 made two cheap-day visits to Bere     
 Ferrers by train, a half-day visit to 
 Maristow by coach and have spent three
 days and two nights on the peninsula  
 which were very worth-while.          
   We would like to thank very warmly  
 all the local people who talked to us 
 so interestingly, the proprietress of 
 the small hotel who did our food      
 shopping for us, the farmer at whose  
 farm we nearly camped and the dear    
 friend-in-need, who arranged for us to
 stay in the Methodist chapel school   
 room.We have very happy memories of   
 Bere Ferrers and earnestly hope that  
 it stays the way it is now.           
   "We" are the girls of Form One, St  
 Dunstan's Abbey School, Plymouth.     </content>
