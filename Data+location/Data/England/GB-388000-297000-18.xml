		<title>18St Andrews Junior School</title>
		<content>One of the local places that I use is  
St.Andrews Junior School which is on   
Coleman Street. It is not just a Junior
School,it also contains an Infant and  
Nursery School. In the Junior section  
there are about 250 pupils,one of whom 
is me. I'm a fourth year and my sister 
is in the first year. Pupils in our    
school come from many parts of the     
world and they boast an array of       
different languages and colour of skin;
not to mention names,which range from  
Joanne to Aksin and Martin to Vinod.   
The school has an attractive garden    
with a large collection of flowers,    
trees and plants.                      
All the fourth year children will leave
and go to schools all over             
Wolverhampton at the end of July. I'm  
sorry that I have to leave as I think  
it is a pleasant and likable place.
