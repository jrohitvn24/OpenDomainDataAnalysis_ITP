		<title>10SCAWSBY HALL AND FARM 2</title>
		<content>    The kitchen at the hall is much    
 older than Tudor. The kitchen and     
 hall (now partitioned) were once a    
 single roomed manor house.A huge tree 
 trunk beam goes right across the      
 ceiling and the walls are nearly a    
 metre thick. There is a loft that you 
 get to up a ladder and through a trap-
 door. It was probably where they      
 slept. The Tudor house is brick built 
 and covered with cement. Some of the  
 glass is Tudor too. There is a bar on 
 one wall they used for hanging people.
    The farm buildings were mostly made
 of stone. There were lots of stables  
 next to each other with split doors,  
 where the farm horses lived. We also  
 saw a wall with holes in it, it was a 
 pig feeder from the olden days. The   
 store buildings were dark and stuffy. 
 There were holes in the doors to let  
 the cats in and out and air vents too.</content>
