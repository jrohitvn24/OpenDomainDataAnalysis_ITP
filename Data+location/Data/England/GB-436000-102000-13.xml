		<title>13A WALK IN THE NEW FOREST</title>
		<content>   In July we went for a walk to       
 Beaulieu and part of the New          
 Forest.When we got to Beaulieu we     
 found a nice place to sit .When we    
 were all sitting down we got out our  
 traffic census out and started working
 on them.My traffic census was to do   
 with the colours of the cars that went
 by.The most popular colour was        
 white.After we did our traffic census 
 we went to have lunch. After lunch we 
 went for our long walk. On the way we 
 found lots of interesting things like 
 ants nests so we put a stick on one of
 their paths to see if the ant would   
 find its way over it and the ant did. 
   When we got back to school every one
 was tired so we all had a little rest 
 from doing work. Our teacher          
 asked us if we had enjoyed the day out
 and everyone said yes.
