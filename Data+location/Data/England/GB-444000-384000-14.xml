		<title>14Employment in Aston</title>
		<content> In the area of the survey aproximately
 78% of men were employed.  Most of the
 jobs were skilled and only 29 men had 
 unskilled jobs.  Some were managerial 
 and a few were professional.  The most
 popular jobs for men were electrician 
 and joiner but surprisingly enough    
 only five were connected in any way   
 with steel, although six years ago the
 figures would have been different.    
 The most popular places for employment
 were Sheffield and Rotherham but some 
 men were employed as far away as York 
 or North Yorkshire.  Approximately 52%
 of the women are employed, but bear it
 in mind that some women might not want
 jobs because they have children to    
 look after, and some are housewives.  
 Most women work locally and most women
 seem to think their jobs are          
 unskilled.
