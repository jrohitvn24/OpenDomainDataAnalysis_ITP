		<title>18Legend of Simonside</title>
		<content> One day a man was walking in the      
 Simonside hills, notorious for being  
 easy to lose your direction in. As    
 daylight faded he became hopelessly   
 lost then eagerly headed in the       
 direction of a distant light.         
 He found that it came from a house    
 with a fire flickering inside. A gnome
 sat on a tree stump by the fire. The  
 gnome seemed angry and signalled him  
 to sit down and reach out for a stick 
 to his left hand side. The man refused
 and the gnome grew angrier. Then the  
 man suddenly fell asleep.             
 He awoke to find that the gnome, the  
 house and the fire were all gone and  
 he was sitting on the edge of a cliff.
 Had he reached out for the stick, he  
 would surely have fallen to his death.
 This is the legend of Simonside and a 
 warning to those who would walk there 
 alone.                                </content>
