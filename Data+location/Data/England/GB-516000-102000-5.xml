		<title>05ECOLOGY WIDEWATER LANCING SX</title>
		<content> The Widewater is an area of brackish  
 water that lies between the beach and 
 the sea.The Widewaters area is 7.5    
 hectares.It is a shallow lagoon,depth 
 one metre.The water is fresh and the  
 bottom is soft mud.In summer it's     
 covered in algae.The earliest date    
 recorded was 1085.It used to cover    
 Shorham airport,Old &amp; New Salts Farm &amp;
 Monks Farm.The second date recorded   
 was 1250.In 1622 a stream flowed from 
 Sompting and another from the west to 
 join the River Adur.By 1700 no rivers 
 or streams flowed,and storms at sea   
 moved weed,shingle &amp; mud into a bank. 
 This bank exists today,but has been   
 artificially improved to prevent      
 floding.The sea has flowed over the   
 bank twice in recent years.This has   
 caused large quantities of shingle in 
 the area.The Widewater in Lancing has 
 a lot of wildlife &amp; vegetation.       </content>
