		<content> In 1924{Henry Morris}outlined plans to
 recast the rural elementary school    
 system. The building of{Sawston       
{Village College,}begun in 1928 was the
 first school to offer its educational 
 facilities to the community as well   
 as to its pupils. It was opened by HRH
 the Prince of Wales on Oct. 30 1930.It
 was a senior school for 250 pupils    
 aged 11 to 14 yrs. drawn from Sawston 
 and the surrounding villages.In 1974  
 the College was offering fully        
 comprehensive education for 1300 boys 
 and girls aged 11 to 16.So Henry      
 Morris's scheme was brought to        
 reality. In 1985 the school has 1335  
 children taught 79 members of staff.  
 At present children wishing for a 6th 
 form education have to travel out of  
 the village.                          
  The small village of{Babraham}has one
 school for children from 5 to 11.     </content>
