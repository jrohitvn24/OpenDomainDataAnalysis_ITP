{ }These figures show the results of a 
 survey done by six schools,Summer 1985
 Pupils  and  parents  were asked about
 the venues of their leisure activities
   Pupils  mostly  travel  to  specific
 places such as a public pool .Slightly
 fewer occupy themselves in the home or
 belong  to  organisations  or  clubs  
 (Church,Youth,Sport).                 
  Most  parents  spend free time in the
 home. A  smaller pecentage travel to a
 specific  place,sometimes accompanying
 their children. The same percentage of
 parents as pupils are members of clubs
 or organisations(judo,golf,football,  
 rugby,keep fit,community groups etc.)
