     On the Saturday after May the     
 first we celebrate May Day in the     
 square.                               
     There are stalls that sell        
 things like trays, books and pencil   
 crayons. Some of the stalls are       
 games.                                
     We have volunteers to be put      
 in the stocks and people throw wet    
 sponges at them. There is also a      
 roundabout.That's fun!                
     We have{May-pole dancing}and a{   
{May Queen.}At school we girls make    
 May crowns and the best one wins.     
 That person is the{May Queen.}        
 Our{May-Fair}attracts many people     
 from the villages close by and brings 
 extra trade and traffic to the town.
