{Beanley}is mainly arable with a small 
 amount of woodland. Most of the male  
 population work on the land.The hounds
 of the{Percy}and{Milvain Hunts}are    
 kennelled at{Beanley.}The village of{ 
{Eglingham}itself has a church, school 
 and Post Office.Although the latter   
 sells groceries it is recorded as P.O.
 only on the survey grid. There is also
 a public house,The Tankerville Arms.  
 At one time there was another,The Ogle
 Arms, but this is now a private house.
  There is a village hall, a market    
 garden specialising in rockery plants,
 a farm in the centre of the village   
 and about thirty-five houses in       
 addition to Eglingham Hall, part of   
 which is now let as flats.
