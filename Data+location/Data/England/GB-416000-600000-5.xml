 There are 63 children who come to our 
 school. There are 3 classes and a     
 nursery. Class 1 is for 17 first      
 years,Class 2 is for 27 2nd and 3rd   
 years. Class 3 is for 19 4th and 5th  
 years. Most children come from Felton 
 Village but some come from farms. 11  
 children come in the school taxi. It  
 travels from the furthest farm,8.5km  
 to the south.                         
 Felton is a long village along the old
 A1.Some village children walk or ride 
 about 1.25km to school. 3 children    
 travel 3km from the north by van, 2   
 travel about 5km from the west. The   
 children who come to the nursery may  
 come further as there are no other    
 nursery classes near. 33 of the       
 children have parents who also went to
 Felton School.                        </content>
