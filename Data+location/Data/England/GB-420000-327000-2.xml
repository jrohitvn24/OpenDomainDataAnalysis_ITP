Rolleston is a small rural village.    
Wherever you look there are large      
patches of greenery and lovely old     
buildings.                             
The oldest building is St. maryÂ£s      
Church:it is older than the oldest     
house.The church was well used in the  
past and we feel at present it is used 
more often.It is a meeting place for   
the choir,the bell ringers,confirmation
classes,Bible study,Helpers and the    
Delta group which teaches children     
over nine to teach others.There is also
a baptism on the first Sunday of each  
month.                                 
The vicar is a very busy man but in    
between all these activities he still  
gets the chance to get the day off on  
a Thursday.On this day off he likes to 
go out for a drive with his wife or lie
under his car and fiddle with it.      </content>
