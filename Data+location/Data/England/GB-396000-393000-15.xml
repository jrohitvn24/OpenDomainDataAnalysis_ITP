		<content>    Im 1969, in one whole day, Jubilee 
Wood was planted , by hand, by 400     
Tameside children, and contains a      
variety of natural species.            
     The activities of the amenity     
society were taken over by Longendale  
Heritage Trust in 1982.  The Trust     
continues to complete the work and has 
added a further planting of 7 acres,   
adjoining Coal Rd., called Adams Wood  
and consists mainly of oak, with some  
ash, holly, birch and cherry.          
     Creating this tree cover has      
increased the presence of plant and    
animal life and secured a constitution 
of the tree -scape feature of the      
valley.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
