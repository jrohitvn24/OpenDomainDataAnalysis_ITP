 The area has no unemployment problem. 
 Most people who wish to work have jobs
 although not always in the village    
 itself.  Those who are employed in the
 area usually work on farms.  There is 
 also a public house.  There is a      
 public stud for National Hunt horses  
 and a farm attached which produces    
 beef cattle, corn and barley.  Help   
 with harvesting produces the need for 
 extra labour.  Other jobs include a   
 farm bailiff, a game keeper,domestic  
 work and a thriving base for tourism  
 at a local farm run by the owner and  
 his family. This involves the         
 provision of accommodation for        
 visitors to the area.  There are also 
 resident within the area members of   
 The Royal Airforce from the Helicopter
 and Air Traffic Control base at nearby
 Shawbury.                             </content>
