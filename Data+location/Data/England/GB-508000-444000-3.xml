		<title>03FARMING IN LEVEN</title>
		<content> The low lying fertile land makes ideal
 conditions for the growing of cereal  
 crops. Wheat &amp; Barley predominate, Oil
 seed Rape is also grown along with    
 some root crops &amp; peas. Leven has     
 several farms some specialise in milk 
 production, others in arable crops,   
 while a few rear pigs &amp; sheep.        
  We visited a typical small mixed     
 livestock farm. It comprises 11 acres,
 which are divided into paddocks for   
 sheep rearing. The flock is the       
 Horsley flock of pedigree Oxford Down,
 established in 1899, the farmer being 
 the third generation to have them.    
  In addition he has 70 sows, 3 boars &amp;
 over 300 piglets &amp; weaners            
 (cross_breds).                        
 The work on the farm is done by both  
 the farmer &amp; his wife in partnership. 
 He also teaches for two days at the   
 Bishop Burton College of Agriculture. </content>
