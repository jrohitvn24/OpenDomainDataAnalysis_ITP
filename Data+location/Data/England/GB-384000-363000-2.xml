		<title>02The River Dane, Congleton</title>
		<content>    The{River Dane}flows East to West  
 through{Congleton}with industry and   
 farmland along it's banks, the latter 
 on the outskirts of town.             
    As the river passes through the    
 town many mills are located by it, but
 most no longer use the river for power
 or waste, nor are they occupied by the
 original textile firms.  Several mill 
 buildings are sub-divided for         
 different businesses.  New industrial 
 estates have been built on land       
 adjacent to the river.                
    Two recreational areas close to the
 river are the Leisure Centre and the  
 Park, with paddle and rowing boats.   
    The water is polluted as it passes 
 through{Congleton}by industry and a   
 sewage works.
