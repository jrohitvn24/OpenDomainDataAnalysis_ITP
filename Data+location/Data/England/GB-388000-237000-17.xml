		<title>17Strensham Water Works</title>
		<content> Officialy opened on 29th April 1953,  
 standing in approx 4 acres; the       
 complex consists of offices, indoor   
 plant, pre-treatment tanks and        
 laboratory. There are detached houses 
 for the superintendant and his deputy.
 On fields below the works there are 12
 sludge ponds of approximately 3/4 acre
 each. From the intake at Upon the     
 water is pumped through two 750 mm    
 diameter raw water mains, approx 5.2  
 km to Strensham Water Works where it  
 enters pre-treatment tanks. The two   
 high lift pump houses take water from 
 the contact tanks through a pipe      
 bridge over the river Avon to Coventry
 Aqueduct on Bredon Hill. Treated water
 is pumped from Strensham into Avon    
 Division via two 675mm, and one 900mm 
 mains, with a number of bulk supplies 
 enroute to feed Lower Seven Division  
 and East Worcestershire waterworks Co.</content>
