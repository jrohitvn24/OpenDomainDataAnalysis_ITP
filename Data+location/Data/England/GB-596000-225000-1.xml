		<title>01COLCHESTER TOWN CENTRE</title>
		<content>   This area surveyed covers the town  
 centre of Colchester, often claimed to
 be the oldest recorded town in        
 Britain,as well as the areas          
 immediately to the north and north    
 west of the town.                     
   The N.W., towards the village of    
 W.Bergholt is extensively agricultural
 land.Colchester golf club takes up a  
 large proportion of land as does the  
 new District General Hospital to the  
 North.                                
   An important feature is the         
 extremely busy railway station that   
 has to cater for the many thousands   
 who commute daily to work in London.  
   It is impossible to describe this   
 area of Colchester without referring  
 to its wealth of history that plays   
 such an important part in the town.
