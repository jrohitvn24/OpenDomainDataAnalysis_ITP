   I live just outside Sutton Veny.I   
 come to school by car every morning.  
 Next to the school is the village     
 hall.  My school uses it for          
 assemblies, dinners and P.E.  The     
 villagers use it for cricket teas, the
 W.I.,sewing classes dances and jumble 
 sales.  Sometimes we do concerts in   
 it.                                   
   Outside is a huge playing field for 
 the school and village.  In the centre
 is a cricket pitch and to the right is
 a cricket pavilion.  In front of that 
 is an adventure playground.  Near the 
 school is a running track marked with 
 white paint.  In the summer our school
 has a sports day in which all the     
 school takes part.  Some of the races 
 are hoop races, skipping races and an 
 obstacle dressing up race.
