		<content>The traditional metal based industries 
of lock and key manufacture and similar
light engineering factories still exist
but there has been a steady decline in 
recent years. Computer technology has  
advanced, working conditions have      
improved but many jobs have been lost. 
Parents are worried about employment   
prospects for school leavers and       
adults. Some people attribute a rise in
teenage crime and drug abuse to        
unemployment.                          
Fears are expressed that national and  
local government are not creating job  
opportunities in areas of new          
technology. Amongst other reasons,bad  
planning is seen as a cause of a fall  
in the general living standard. Some   
work has been created by government    
but,although designed as useful        
training it is seen by some  as low    
grade, temporary employment.           </content>
