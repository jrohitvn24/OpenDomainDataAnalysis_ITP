 The block is predominantly rural,     
 woodland and farmland. The population 
 is restricted to a dense band of pre  
 and post war housing to the west.     
 Since 1980 the Elmdon Heath area has  
 been developed. Luxury type housing, a
 private hospital and nursing home have
 been constructed. The population is   
 served by Coppice Junior School and   
 Yew Tree Primary School.              
   At the centre of the block is the   
 village of Catherine de Barnes, cut in
 two by the Grand Union Canal.         
   To the east the M42 motorway cuts   
 across the farmland and the River     
 Blythe, from north to south.
