		<content> Our area is mostly fields and farmland
 The area is hilly and cut with valleys
 running from the North East to the    
 South East.The main valley is the     
 River Amber which runs diagonally to  
 the south end of our area.On the South
 end of our area there is a Flourspar  
 Prossesing Plan on the White Hillocks 
 in Overton.In Ashover there are three 
 kinds of stone,Alluvium,Toadstone and 
 Carboniferous Limestone Series{(Dinant
{_ion _Cawdor Group).}There are four   
 different rivers,the River Amber,Marsh
 Brook,Smally Brook and Hodgelane Brook
 ,there is also Press Reservoir.There  
 are lots of stone walls around Ashover
 mostly made out of Lime Stone and Sand
 Stone;some stone walls have fossils   
 in them.Ashover Rock is made out of   
 gritstone.The houses are mostly made  
 out of limestone.The limestone was    
 probably from the local Butts Quarry. </content>
