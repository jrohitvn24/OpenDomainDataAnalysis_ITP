		<title>11FISHING FROM ST.AGNES</title>
		<content>   THERE WAS ONCE A SMALL HARBOUR AT   
{TREVAUNANCE}TO CATER FOR THE SHIPS    
 TRANSPORTING TIN ORE.BUT THIS HAS BEEN
 OVERWHELMED BY THE SEA AND ALL THAT   
 NOW  REMAINS IS A PILE OF STONES AND  
 RUBBLE.THE ONLY BOATS WHICH NOW       
 OPERATE FROM ST.AGNES ARE SMALL OPEN  
 BOATS WHICH CAN BE LAUNCHED, WEATHER  
 PERMITTING FROM THE BEACH AT          
{TREVAUNANCE}AND RECOVERED USING A     
 WINCH.THE MEN WHO WORK THESE BOATS DO 
 SO PART TIME DURING THE SUMMER,       
 FISHING WITH POTS FOR CRABS AND       
 LOBSTERS, OR LINES FOR POLLOCK AND    
 MACKEREL,THE CATCHES BEING SOLD       
 LOCALLY.SOME ST.AGNES FISHERMEN WORK  
 LARGER BOATS IN THE ST.AGNES AREA     
 CATCHING SHELLFISH IN "STRINGS" OF    
 CRAB POTS BUT DUE TO THEIR SIZE THESE 
 BOATS ARE KEPT AT NEWQUAY AND THE MEN 
 TRAVEL DAILY.
