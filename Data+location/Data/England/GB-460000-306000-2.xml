		<content> In the East,farming is still an       
 important and successful industry;the 
 rich soils sustaining a healthy mixed 
 farming industry based on sheep and   
 cattle and the growing of wheat,barley
 and potatoes and,especially with      
 E.E.C. encouragement,the growing of   
 cash lucrative crops such as rape.    
 Market gardening concerns operate on  
 the edge of the city.                 
 The area to the west of this block    
 portrays evidence of Leicester's      
 industrial importance based on the old
 industries of hosiery,light           
 engineering  and printing.Newer       
 industries have sprung up,located in  
 small industrial trading estates.     
 Barkby Thorpe Road is an important    
 industrial area and smaller ones are  
 located on the Melton Road and in     
 Thurmaston.Two large firms here are   
 Thorn Lighting and Parker Plant.      </content>
