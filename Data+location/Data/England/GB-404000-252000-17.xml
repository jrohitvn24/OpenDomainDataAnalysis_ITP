		<title>17The Pheasantry - Shooting</title>
		<content> The pheasant shooting season is from  
 1st October to the 1st February each  
 year. On the Ragley Estate the        
 shooting is confined to twenty days   
 each season.                          
 On each shoot there are a maximum of  
 ten guns. Fourteen beaters are used to
 drive the pheasants on to the guns.   
 Each year the stock of birds is       
 increased with 1000 young pheasants   
 reared by the gamekeeper, Mr. Ward, at
 the Dunnington Pheasantry.
