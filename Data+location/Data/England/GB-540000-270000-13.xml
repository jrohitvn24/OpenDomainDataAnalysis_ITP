		<title>13Traffic through Willingham</title>
		<content> The village of{Willingham}has         
 developed around a cross-roads about  
 10 miles north of Cambridge and 2     
 miles south of a river crossing at    
 Earith. Its strategic position means  
 that, at peak times, there is a       
 considerable traffic flow in all four 
 directions.                           
 The{speed limit}inside the village    
 boundaries is 40 m.p.h. falling to 30 
 m.p.h. in the centre of the village.  
 In the peak traffic periods, from 8.00
 to 9.00 hrs. and 17.00 to 18.00 hrs., 
 more than{250 vehicles per hour}pass  
 through the cross roads. These are    
 mainly{private cars.}Lorries, some    
 carrying local produce, form the next 
 highest category. The main flow tends 
 to be towards{Cambridge}in the morning
 and the reverse in the evening,       
 indicating the significant employment 
 factor of the proximity of the city.  </content>
