		<title>12BANK HOLIDAY ACTIVITIES</title>
		<content> On May Day Bank Holiday we went to the
 Royal Horticultural Society's Wisley  
 Garden.  We went down to the Pinetum. 
 It was in the shade. The car park was 
 packed solid.  At the Pinetum we      
 saw lots of pine, spruce, fir and     
 cedar trees. We went into the green_  
 house. They were selling Scots Pine   
 for Â£8.50.  It would be much          
 cheaper to grow them ourselves.

 In the morning I woke at 7 a.m. As it 
 was Bank Holiday I stayed in bed until
 9 a.m. I washed, dressed and put on my
 track suit.   I went downstairs for   
 breakfast.Then my brother and I caught
 bees for Daddy to put on the straw-   
 berries in the greenhouse. We went to 
 the pub for a drink before lunch.I had
 two bottles of apple juice and a      
 packet of crisps.After lunch I played 
 with my cat and went on the swing.    </content>
