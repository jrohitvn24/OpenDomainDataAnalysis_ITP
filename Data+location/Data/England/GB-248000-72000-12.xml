		<title>12Tavistock-Bedford Connection</title>
		<content>    Two gateways of the{Abbey}remain - 
 Court Gate and Betsy Grimbal's Tower. 
 The still tower, where the monks used 
 to make medicines, is beside the river
 and there is a ruined arch from the   
 Abbey church in the churchyard.       
    When Henry VIII dissolved the      
 monasteries, he gave Tavistock Abbey  
 and all its lands to the{Russell}     
 family, who later became the{Dukes of 
{Bedford.}                             
    By 1860, Francis, Duke of Bedford, 
 rebuilt the centre of the town and    
 built cottages, for the miners, using 
 some of the fortune he made out of    
{copper mining.}                       
    Bedford Square is the centre of the
 town.It is there that school children 
 dance their{May Revels}around a       
 Maypole and perform country dances    
 while grown-ups collect money for     
 charity from the spectators.          </content>
