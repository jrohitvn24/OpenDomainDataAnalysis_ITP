		<title>17HOPE VALLEY LIONS</title>
		<content> The Hope Valley Lions Club was formed 
 almost 16 years ago by men who uphold 
 the principles of Lions International.
 There are over 330,000 Lions clubs in 
 56 countries.  They have one and a    
 quarter million members whose aim is  
 raise money to help people who are    
 less fortunate than themselves.  This 
 year Hope Valley president is Harry   
 Newton, and he has been with the club 
 through out its life.  The club in its
 time has raised and spent over        
 Â£50,000.  The list of receiving       
 organisations is endless.  Many local 
 charities have benefited from the hard
 work the Lions of Hope Valley have put
 in over the years.  None of the funds 
 raised goes in administration costs so
 that every pound donated by the public
 goes to charitable causes.
