		<title>07FARMING HIGH ERCALL</title>
		<content> There are nine farms in the           
 High Ercall area. Most of them grow a 
 range of crops and some keep animals. 
 The crops they grow are grain crops,  
 such as wheat and barley, potatoes and
 sugar beet. The sugar beet goes to the
 sugar beet factory nearby. Several    
 acres are used for growing grass for  
 silage which is fed to the farm       
 animals in winter. Most farms have    
 some cows, sheep and a few pigs.Many  
 large greenhouses are to be found at  
 Roden. However in recent years        
 greenhouses have been pulled down     
 because of competition from Holland.  
 Dutch tomatoes can be produced cheaper
 than English tomatoes. Many workers   
 have lost their jobs.
