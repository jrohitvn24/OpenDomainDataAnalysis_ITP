		<content> self employed and similar. There are  
 quite a large number of retired people
 in the community, some locals, and    
 some who have moved into the area upon
 retirement. The rector lives in the   
 New Rectory, while the old rectory is 
 occupied by a Shrewsbury solicitor.   
 None of the teachers in the school    
 live in the immediate neighbourhood. A
 number of people are employed in      
 shops, offices, and factories in      
 Shrewsbury: a few commute further     
 afield to Telford and to towns in the 
 West Midlands.  There are now quite a 
 number unemployed, and some wives work
 part time as home helps.
