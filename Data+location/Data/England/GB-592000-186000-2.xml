		<content> THE TYPES OF TRANSPORT THAT EXIST ARE 
 VEHICLES EITHER PULLED BY HORSES SUCH 
 AS CARTS OR MORE COMMONLY VEHICLES    
 POWERED BY ENGINES SUCH AS CARS AND   
 LORRIES. BICYCLES WHICH ARE PEDDLED   
 ARE ALSO VERY POPULAR.  THE           
 TRANSPORT WE USE MOST IS THE CAR      
 WHICH IS A FORM OF PRIVATE TRANSPORT  
 BUT SOME PEOPLE USE PUBLIC TRANSPORT  
 WHICH IS LARGE BUSES OR COACHES WHICH 
 STOP AT CERTAIN PLACES ALONG A ROUTE  
 AND PICK UP PASSENGERS.   THE OLDER   
 CHILDREN IN THE AREA USE COACHES TO   
 TRANSPORT THEM TO THEIR SCHOOL WHICH  
 IS OUTSIDE OUR AREA.   PEOPLE DO NOT  
 WALK VERY MUCH EXCEPT FOR PLEASURE.   
 IF THEY HAVE TO GET ANYWHERE WITHIN   
 THE AREA THEY USUALLY CYCLE OR DRIVE  
 A CAR AND IF THEY WANT TO GO OUTSIDE  
 THE AREA THEY WOULD EITHER DRIVE THE  
 CAR OR WAIT FOR A BUS AT A BUS STOP.  
 THERE ARE 7 BUS ROUTES IN OUR AREA.   </content>
