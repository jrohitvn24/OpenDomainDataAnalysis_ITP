		<title>02MAIN FEATURES OF AMBLE AREA</title>
		<content> The{Amble}area comprises two main     
 settlements - Amble and the village of
{Warkworth.}They are two contrasting   
 areas of population and history.      
{Warkworth}to the{north-west of Amble  
 is about{a mile away along the River  
{Coquet}and retains much of its        
{historical character}with{medieval    
{castle, church, bridge}and{layout of  
{burgage plots}which still are much in 
 evidence in the landscape.{Amble      
{developed after the River Coquet      
{changed its course}from{a small manor 
{to an industrial port}with a{growing  
{population}in the nineteenth century. 
 Amble developed as a result of the    
{demand for coal,}mined south of the   
 town, and{exported from a busy harbour
{built during the early part of the    
{nineteenth century.}Amble has grown   
 with{the movement of villagers from   
{the surrounding areas}into the town.  </content>
