		<title>13EDUCATION - CAROLYN'S DAY</title>
		<content>A day in the life of Carolyn.          
I start the day at seven o'clock when I
go downstairs to get dressed. My dad   
gets breakfast and then I brush my     
teeth, comb my hair and get my coat and
bag. Sometimes my dad goes to work     
early so I have to stay at my Nana's   
house. There I watch the television    
until it is time to go to school. When 
the whistle goes I go to my classroom  
and take out my 7-a-day book which has 
sums inside it. It is good, we also    
have sums on the blackboard.Then we go 
to assembly after which we do English  
until playtime and continue doing      
similar work until 12 o'clock. We      
finish dinner as 12:30 and then play.  
In the afternoon we have more lessons  
with stories and games. Put up chairs  
and go home. I walk home with Trisha.  
We play out until its time to go in.
