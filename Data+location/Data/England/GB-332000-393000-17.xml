		<title>17A SUMMER CARNIVAL IN BOOTLE.</title>
		<content>   We have had a carnival in{Bootle.}It
 is part of{Mersyside's Community      
{Summer Festival.}It began on Saturday 
 8th June at the{North Park.}People    
 could enjoy the free{entertainment.   
 They had morris dancers, clowns,      
 jugglers and face painters.They had   
 steel and brass bands playing         
 different tunes. At the{New Strand,   
 shoppers got a surprise because they  
 had escapologists and jugglers.There  
 were comedians there to make them     
 laugh.The{Carnival}lasts for two      
 months and other events include:puppet
 shows,street theatres,folk singing,   
 disco's and Latin American dancing.On 
 the{Dock Road}they have a pram race   
 and a fancy dress parade.I think the  
{carnival}is a great idea because old  
 and young people can enjoy it.We don't
 have to pay for it as it's all free.  
 People can laugh and have good fun.   </content>
