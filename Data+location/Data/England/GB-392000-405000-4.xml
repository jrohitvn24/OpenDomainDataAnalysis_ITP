		<title>04INDUSTRY IN MOORSIDE</title>
		<content> WE WENT TO VISIT A FACTORY CALLED     
 DONCASTERS OF MOORSIDE. WHEN WE WENT  
 THERE WE FOUND THAT IN 1778 WHEN IT   
 OPENED IT USED TO BE A CARPET MILL. IT
 GOT ITS NAME BECAUSE IT USED TO BE    
 OWNED BY DANIEL DONCASTER. THEN THE   
 MILL CLOSED DOWN. IT WAS LEFT DISUSED 
 FOR A LONG TIME. THEN IT CHANGED. A   
 COMPANY CALLED INCO BOUGHT IT TO MAKE 
 PARTS FOR SHIPS AND PLANES, IN        
 PARTICULAR NUTS AND BOLTS. THEY SEND  
 THE PARTS TO COUNTRIES SUCH AS INDIA, 
 AUSTRALIA,NEW ZEALAND, SAUDI ARABIA,  
 INDONESIA AND RUSSIA. THEY EMPLOY     
 ABOUT 75 MEN. THE SMALLEST NUT THEY   
 MAKE WOULD COST ABOUT A YEAR'S POCKET 
 MONEY - FIFTY POUNDS.
