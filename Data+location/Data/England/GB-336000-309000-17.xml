		<content>{ Mr.Hemmings}of Pear Tree and Silver- 
 dale Farms keeps two breeds of chick- 
 ens.One of them is{Cobb}and the other 
 is{Ross.}He keeps them to lay live    
 eggs  which go to be hatched at Church
 Stretton and then fattened for meat.  
  He keeps them in{7 sheds,}each one   
 contains about{2,857 chickens.}It is  
 easy to feed them all.They are fed by 
 a machine that takes the feed out of a
 tank onto a conveyor belt and around  
 the sheds.They eat fish meal,crushed  
 wheat,protein feed and grit,which is  
 to make the egg shells.They drink from
 a cup shaped thing which hangs from   
 the the roof.A pipe leads from it to a
 tank of water.                        
  The hens are kept for{60 weeks}then  
 they are sold for meat paste and pies.
 Day old chicks take their place.Feath-
 ers go for pillows,oil for cosmetics  
 and muck goes onto the fields.        </content>
