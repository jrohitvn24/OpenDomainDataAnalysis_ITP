		<content>     Following the inundation by the   
sea in 1953 when most of the area was  
covered by floods resulting from breaks
in the then sea walls, the whole area  
has been protected by a new sea wall   
surmounted by a roadway. There is a    
drift along this North facing coast and
the wall is protected from the effect  
of this by groynes and shingle infill. 
There is provision by sluices and gates
for the discharge of water at low tide.
     The defences are maintained by the
Southern Water Authority. They are also
responsible for the small Sewage Works,
a maceration plant, which may possibly 
be phased out in the future (1986?).
