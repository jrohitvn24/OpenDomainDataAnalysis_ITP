		<title>11Alrewas Mill</title>
		<content>This dates back to 1614 in parts, but  
most of the building is from 1785 when 
a water powered cotton mill was here.  
It has been an animal feedstuff mill   
since the early 19th century and was   
bought by Midland Pig Producers Ltd. in
1976.  They trade as M.P.P. Ltd. here. 
The company has 20,000 bacon pigs at   
units throughout Staffordshire and the 
mill makes 250 tonnes of feed per week.
The mill operates for 6 days a week    
from 7 am. to 6 pm.  There are 3 lorry 
drivers, 8 male mill workers and 2     
female office workers.  Production is  
powered by electricity.  Part of the   
outbuildings are sub-let to Trent      
Insulations Ltd.  The feed is delivered
in bulk to the pig units in 18 tonne   
lorries.  Some other feed is made in   
small quantities.
