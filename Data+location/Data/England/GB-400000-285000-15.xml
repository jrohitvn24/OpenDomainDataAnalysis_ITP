 every day. When I get there I read the
{Koran.}The mosque is a{house.}We pray 
 downstairs and the girls and the      
 ladies read upstairs. If we drop the  
 Koran we get into{trouble.}During     
{Ramadan}when{fasting}we get up at{2.am
 to eat. There are{30 fasting days}and 
 then it is{Eid,}a muslim festival. We 
 put up{decorations and celebrate      
 because this is the day the Koran was 
{finished.}At Eid I go to the mosque   
 and read{namaaz.}In my best clothes I 
 go to visit cousins. I like Eid       
 because I get lots of money.'         </content>
