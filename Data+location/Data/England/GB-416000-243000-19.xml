		<content> On the second full day of our week    
 at Broad Haven we went to{Skomer}. The
 only inhabited house on the island was
 occupied by our guide Rosanne.She took
 us to the derelict farmhouse.Near this
 she fetched a{manx shearwater}from its
 burrow.We saw all the old farm        
 machinery like the plough,the tractor 
 and a horse-powered drive for farm    
 machines in the barn.There are holiday
 rooms that are let to holiday makers  
 in the Summer.We went on a Nature     
 Trail round the island and saw the    
 birds on our spotter list.We went     
 through a nesting colony of{lesser    
{black-backed gulls}with some{herring  
{gulls.}We watched{kittiwakes,razor-   
{bills,guillemots}on a steep cliff face
 and{puffins}by their burrows.On a     
 sunny rock by the sea a{grey seal}was 
 basking in the sun.{Thrift,bluebells, 
{sea campion}were flowering everywhere.</content>
