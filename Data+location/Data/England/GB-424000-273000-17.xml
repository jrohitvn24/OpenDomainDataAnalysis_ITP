{ CAR OF THE EIGHTIES BY BEN C         
 My new Volvo 340 I think its great,   
 Old cars I really hate!Its really bold
 and slick,The 5 gear speed box is     
 really quick.The iluminous dials go   
 green and white.The stereo is out of  
 site,If I had an X-Ray eye I now what 
 I would spy.A lot of protection tuned 
 to perfection,In case of a crash its  
 worth the cash.                       
       {SHOPPING IN THE 80's}          
 Mum took me to town in her new Montego
 .We stopped at a petrol station with  
 liquid crystal displays and free      
 digital watches with 5 litres of oil. 
 We then carried on to the pay and     
 display car park behind Asda where we 
 parked next to a C5.We got our trolley
 and I went to the clothes department  
 while mum went to the the supermarket 
 part.I selected some Jelly Bean shoes,</content>
