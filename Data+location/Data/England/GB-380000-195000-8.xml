 14-London,S.E.,6-North, 1-Scotland and
 2 outside the U.K.  YEARS IN RESIDENCE
 Only one of 61 respondents has lived  
 in Kingscote for more than 60 years,  
 1 of 3 who have lived here all their  
 lives.  7 have lived here from 26 - 45
  years, 21 from 6 - 25 years and the  
 remaining 33, 5 years or less.  FUTURE
 MOBILITY 35% of respondents expect to 
 ive in Kingscote for the rest of their
 lives.  65% do not.  In conclusion    
 very few people have strong local     
 roots in the past, but more have      
 adopted "local citizenship" and plan  
 to develop roots here into the future.
 Others expect to move with work or as 
 old age compounds local problems.     </content>
