		<content> Barrington School-Summer Term 1985.   
 On the 29th.April we went to our      
 school camp at Charterhouse.We stayed 
 in little huts &amp; there was a big field
 to play in.We went for long walks and 
 did lots of environmental studies.We  
 went to the Hambridge Festival in May 
 to give a Maypole dancing display.As  
 well as taking part in the Sponsored  
 walk I went with the skittleball team 
 to Tatworth school for the rally-both 
 during June.On the 22nd.of June we    
 went to Wells to take part in a       
 Country Dancing Festival with about   
 2000 children from other Somerset     
 schools.It rained all day so we could 
 not dance.Instead we sang in the      
 cathedral.We joined with 3 other      
 schools-Hinton St. George,Shepton     
 Beauchamp &amp; Hazelbury Plucknett for a 
 Sports afternoon on the 3rd.July.
