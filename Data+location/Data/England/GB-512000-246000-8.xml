		<title>08Religion in Northill</title>
		<content> Of the 850 souls in the{ecclesiastical
{Parish of Northill,}the vast majority 
 would declare their faith as{Christian
 in its various forms.  There is only  
 one building for public worship,{the  
{parish church of St. Mary Virgin,}(the
 Living being administered by the Com- 
 pany of Grocers).  The church is built
 mainly of ironstone, and was completed
 in about 1370.  It is currently under-
 going substantial restoration.  About 
 10% of the population attend regular  
 weekly services, led by the{Rector}and
 some lay folk.  Many are not adherents
 of the{Church of England,}the estab-  
 lished church, but are welcomed and   
 join in the community worship.        
 The Christian ethic of duty to God and
 neighbour is evident and the small    
 minority who are of other faiths      
 exhibit this tenet too. The Parishion-
 ers live together in religious harmony</content>
