		<title>03Railways - Branch lines</title>
		<content> The main line from Taunton to Exeter  
 had two branches in the 19th Century, 
 both leaving from Norton Fitzwarren   
 station - now owned by Taunton Cider. 
 The West Somerset Railway opened in   
 1862 to Watchet and extended to       
 Minehead in 1874. The Devon and       
 Somerset line to Barnstaple was       
 built cheaply with only three crossing
 loops in 43 mls of single track.  Both
 lines fell under Dr. Beeching's axe in
 1964 although in 1974 the West        
 Somerset Railway was reopened         
 privately from Bishops Lydeard north. 
 Future plans include control of signal
 boxes and crossings from Exeter       
 computers in 1986.
