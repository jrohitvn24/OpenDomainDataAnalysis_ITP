		<title>04SUTTON LOWER SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The school was built in 1870 by the   
 Burgoyne family who,at that time,owned
 the village of Sutton.It is an        
 attractive Victorian building         
 featuring tall chimneys,a bell tower  
 and some interesting decorative       
 brickwork.                            
 A new extension was added in 1970 and 
 oil-fired central heating was also    
 installed.The front playground        
 contains two large lime trees which   
 add to the pleasing appearance of the 
 building.At the rear of the school is 
 a large field which is used by the    
 children for play and sporting        
 activities.There are 2 classrooms,a   
 serving area for school meals,2       
 cloakrooms and an office.             
 At present there are 27 children on   
 roll with 2 teaching staff including  
 the Headmistress.There are 2 part-time
 ancillary helpers and a caretaker.    </content>
