		<title>02IMPRESSIONS OF HANLEY</title>
		<content>I (Lessa Adams)live in a semi-detached 
house in Hanley.My mum and dad have    
lived in number one for thirteen years 
and the street is called Mulberry      
Street.There are ten houses in our     
street with our house and they are all 
the same age.There are still a lot of  
terraced homes in Hanley though.       
I like Hanley and I think it is a very 
good place for shopping.I also like the
discos and I go to one in Bryan Street 
with my friends.I think there should be
more disco places for children and more
parks and playgrounds for children in  
Hanley.                                
                                       
I(Stuart Summerhill)think Hanley is a  
very nice town with lots of children   
so I can make lots of friends.There is 
a paper mill and a factory which gives 
you golf balls and Hanley is a very    
busy town with lots of shops.          </content>
