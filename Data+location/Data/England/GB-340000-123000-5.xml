		<content> After the walk they have a service in 
 the church and then, tea in the hall. 
 The hall used to be our school, but it
 was  closed and was bought by the     
 village and it is now used as a       
 Village Hall.                         
  Wartime was quiet here.  We were     
 lucky we only lost one of the village 
 men who went to fight. We had evacuees
 in the school, with their teachers,   
 and they were billeted in all the     
 houses.                               
  We always get flooding in the low    
 parts of the village when we get heavy
 rain.  Once, when it was bad, we were 
 cut off between us and Curry Rivel,   
 East Street and Norh Street and the   
 bottom of School Street, and it always
 floods between us and Muchelney. A few
 people get it in their houses.        
 Midelney also gets cut  off, down near
 the river.                            </content>
