		<title>02HISTORY OF STUBHAMPTON AREA</title>
		<content>    This upland wooded area was known  
 to Neolithic man.  An ancient highway,
 thought to be part of the Ridgeway,   
 traverses the section east to west,   
 with tumuli to be found at Stubhampton
 and a Barrow alongside the present C13
 road.                                 
    Later it became part of the great  
 Cranborne Chase, renowned for its     
 hunting and notorious for smuggling   
 and poaching.  King John acquired it  
 through marriage in the 12th century. 
    The Chase was divided into eight   
 Walks, the Ranger of the West Walk    
 living at West Lodge, a historic house
 lived in and added to in the 18th     
 century by John Pitt MP.              
    Sutton Hill Farm was one of those  
 used by Anthony Huxtable, Rector of   
 Sutton Waldron (1834-71), for his     
 experiments in scientific farming.
