		<content> The parish church of Stretton Sugwas  
 is dedicated to St.Mary Magdalene. It 
 was built in l878 to replace the 13th 
 century church near Stretton Court.   
 Much of the new church used materials 
 from the old site, including three    
 Romanesque or Norman arches. Old      
 timber was used to make a higher      
 tower, the vertical black timbers     
 being separated by narrow panels of   
 white-painted infill. This design is  
 peculiar to Herefordshire.            
 Until very recently the parish had its
 own Rector, but now has to share one  
 with the adjoining parish of Burghill 
 because of the greatly reduced number 
 of active worshippers in the Church of
 England generally. There are no other 
 places of worship, members of other   
 religious denominations having to     
 travel into Hereford or beyond.
