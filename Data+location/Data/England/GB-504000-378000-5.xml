		<title>05THE AVERAGE FARM</title>
		<content> The average farm size in the area is  
 250 acres, 75-80% of which is used to 
 grow winter wheat. The remaining      
 acreage is used to grow oilseed rape, 
 peas, winter barley, spring barley,   
 potatoes and sugar beet.              
                                       
 Some farmers have their own reservoir 
 for irrigation purposes, mainly for   
 the potato crop. The reservoir of one 
 farmer holds 5.4 million gallons and  
 he has a licence to fill it from a    
 river during the winter months.       
                                       
 These farmers only employ one or two  
 farm labourers and so at harvest time 
 they use casual workers from the town.
 Very few farmers' wives work on the   
 farm even at harvest time, although   
 many are involved in the book-keeping 
 and office work.
