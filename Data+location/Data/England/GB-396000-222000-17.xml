		<content> THERE ARE{THREE DIFFERENT TYPES}OF    
 ROAD WITHIN THE BLOCK,{MAIN ROADS,    
{RESIDENTIAL STREETS AND COUNTRY LANES.
 THE{PRESTBURY ROAD}FORMS PART OF THE  
 MAIN A46 ROUTE TO WINCHCOMBE,         
 STRATFORD UPON AVON AND EVENTUALLY TO 
 LINCOLN. IT CARRIES A LOT OF HEAVY    
 TRAFFIC TO AND FROM THE CENTRE OF     
 CHELTENHAM.{HALES ROAD,}WHICH BECOMES 
{PRIORS ROAD}AND THEN{BOUNCERS LANE,}IS
 SIGNPOSTED TO CARRY THROUGH TRAFFIC   
 AWAY FROM THE TOWN CENTRE. THE        
{RESIDENTIAL STREETS}ARE FAIRLY QUIET  
 WITH THE EXCEPTION OF{CROMWELL ROAD   
 AND{WHADDON ROAD,}WHICH FORM A LINK   
 BETWEEN THE TWO MAIN ROADS. SOME OF   
 THE TRAFFIC IS REQUIRING ACCESS TO THE
 SHOPS IN WHADDON ROAD AND A GREAT DEAL
 OF THE MORNING AND LATE AFTERNOON     
 TRAFFIC IS THAT GOING TO AND FROM     
{G.C.H.Q.}THE HILLS IN THE BLOCK ARE   
 SERVED BY NARROW,{QUIET COUNTRY LANES.</content>
