		<title>18RODNEY STOKE NATURE RESERVE</title>
		<content> Many plant species exist in this      
 Reserve. Ash is the dominant woodland 
 species but oak and hazel are common; 
 lime, elm, field maple and whitebeam  
 also occur as well as species of      
 introduced trees such as sycamore,    
 larch and Norway spruce. A wide       
 variety of plant habitats exist; ferns
 and mosses are common in shady, rocky 
 conditions, but in peripheral fields  
 careful management allows orchids,    
 clovers, trefoils and vetches to      
 flourish. 30 species of butterfly have
 been identified and badgers are common
 along with foxes, bats and rabbits. 72
 species of bird are recorded of which 
 27 breed within the Reserve. Grazing  
 and cutting of pasture and scrub as   
 well as thinning of woodland are      
 deliberately practised to encourage   
 natural regeneration.
