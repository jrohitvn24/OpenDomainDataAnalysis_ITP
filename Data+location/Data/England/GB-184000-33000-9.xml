		<content> As there is not a bridge linking      
 either Truro or Falmouth with the area
 journeys to these towns are long and  
 the roads are very winding.The nearest
 rail terminals are at Truro and       
 St.Austell,making travel from these   
 stations to the area,a very           
 complicated and expensive operation,as
 bus services are so infrequent and    
 taxi services extremely costly.       
{St.Mawes to Falmouth Ferry.           
 There are two different types of ferry
 operating on the Roseland Peninsula   
 that are used by local people.One of  
 these which links the Roseland        
 Peninsula with Truro is some six miles
 from the block.The other ferry sails  
 from St.Mawes Quay to the Prince of   
 Wales pier and carries only passengers
 and cycles.This ferry takes about half
 an hour and operates every half hour  
 in the summer and every hour in Winter</content>
