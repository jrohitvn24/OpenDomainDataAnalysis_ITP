		<title>10The Youth Club, St.Mary.</title>
		<content> A youth club is a place to have fun.  
 To meet new friends. You can play     
 outside or inside. You can go and have
 something to eat if you want to. To   
 join the club you need 20p. The age   
 range is 9 to 19 years. Juniors 9-13  
 Wed. 7-9  40 people. Seniors 13-19    
 Fri. 7.30-10.00 90 people. It is a    
 good idea to have youth clubs because 
 you can get away from your family and 
 help you to become independent; it    
 will give you something to do after   
 school. They need more people to help 
 look after the children. Activities   
 consist of football, roller hockey,   
 netball, cricket, rowing, rounders,   
 pool, snooker, tabletennis, bingo and 
 a raffle. The downstairs room is a    
 disco room and canteen. Upstairs is a 
 games area and stage. They have       
 holidays at Crabbe. Mr.Munns is one of
 the Club's helpers.                   </content>
