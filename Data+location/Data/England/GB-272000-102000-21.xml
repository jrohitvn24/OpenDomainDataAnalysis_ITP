Since 1986, the village of Down St Mary has continued to grow, if only in a small way. However, the facilities have declined. It is many years since the Post Office &amp; Stores was closed. Later the garage took over selling groceries for a while. Eventually, that too closed and is now run as a second-hand car dealership.
