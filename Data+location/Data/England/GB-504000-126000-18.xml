		<content> I usually get up at about six-thirty  
 on both weekdays and weekends. Once I 
 am awake I go and wash. Then I read   
 for about ten minutes. After that I   
 dress and go for a quick jog. When I  
 get home I play on our computer until 
 Mum gets up.                          
       For breakfast on Saturdays I    
 just have some cereal and coffee.     
 After breakfast I sometimes have a    
 friend over to play. I often go down  
 to the woods and play in the mud. When
 I get home it is usually time for     
 lunch at one o'clock. On Saturdays we 
 have bacon, eggs, tomatoes, salad and 
 mango. This is one of my favourite    
 lunches.                              
     After lunch I play on the computer
 which is a Spectrum. I have lots of   
 games such "Starion" and "Wizard's    
 Lair".
