		<content> Customs/Folk Lore and Traditions      
 In a three to four mile compass around
 the town of Horsham, which lies near  
 the western edge of the forest,there  
 was, alledgedly in the middle ages, a 
 dragon or Serpent of about 9ft in     
 length with scales in his back and    
 under belly, who by his poisonous     
 venom, killed the inhabitants of his  
 Kingdom He was often seen around the  
 village of Faygate and three of the   
 villagers swore to have personally to 
 have seen the Fearful Beast and were  
 very much afraid, so terrified were   
 many of the inhabitants of the Forest 
 in that area they would not go out    
 alone by day or night for fear of an  
 Encounter.                            
 St Leonard on hearing of this danger  
 came to kill the Dragon with his      
 sword where the blood fell the lilies 
 turned pink.. so legend goes          </content>
