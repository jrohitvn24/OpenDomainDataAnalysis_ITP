The May Day is an anual event run by   
the local Women's Institute (W.I.)     
catering mainly for children. All      
children living in the village aged    
between 5 and 11 years are eligible for
the position of Queen, Attendant or    
Page Boy. Villagers meet and parade to 
the village green where the new Queen  
is crowned. Children give posies to all
the watching ladies. Then there is a   
display of Maypole dancing and Morris  
dancing given by the children of Gayton
Junior School. After this there are    
some fun races such as the 3-legged and
the slow bicycle race and a floral     
arrangement competition with a special 
theme. Finally the W.I. provide all the
children with a packed tea. It is a    
lovely village day totally             
uncomercialized and relatively peaceful
but a fun day enjoyed by everyone.     </content>
