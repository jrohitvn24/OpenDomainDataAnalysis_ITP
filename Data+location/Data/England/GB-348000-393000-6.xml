		<title>06A shopping centre-St.Helens</title>
		<content> The{Hardshaw Centre}is one of the most
 modern shopping centres in the        
 country.As you walk in from Chuch     
 Street there is a big sign-it says    
 'The Hardshaw Centre'.                
    The floor is made of marble,and on 
 the walls there is a picture of the   
 old Greenall's Brewery where they used
 to make beer.The Centre is on the old 
 Greenall's site.                      
    Inside the Centre there is a       
 wooden snake called KES (Kid Eating   
 Snake);it is hollow so you can crawl  
 through it.You go through the mouth   
 and out through the tail.             
    The Centre is well-planned.Boots   
 and Marks &amp; Spencer were already and  
 the Centre joined on to them.         
    On top of the Centre there is a    
 carpark which has a capacity of 500   
 cars,and if you buy over Â£3 of food at
 Presto's you get a free parking token.</content>
