		<content> Wisbech St. Mary Parish Church        
 The Church was built about 1385 and is
 Perpendicular Gothic in style.  There 
 is a 20th Century brass of Canon      
 Mowbray Smith near the font.  Across  
 the road from the church is the Church
 House in which meetings are held.     
 There are services in church every    
 Sunday at 11am, usually Sung Eucharist
 but on the first Sunday in the month  
 we have a Family Service.  Sunday     
 School meets in the village school at 
 11am and the children go up to church 
 for the last 20 minutes of the service
 The bell-ringers practise in church   
 from 7.30 till 9pm on Fridays.  The   
 bells are rung for half an hour before
 services and weddings.  We have no    
 vicar at the moment.  Our last vicar  
 was also Archdeacon of Wisbech.  He   
 left in August 1984 to become Dean of 
 Ely.  Our new vicar is coming in Sept.</content>
