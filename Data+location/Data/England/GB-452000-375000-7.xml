		<content>  The parish church of{St. Lawrence    
 stands on a hill to the north of the  
 village.There are traces of Saxon     
 stonework but the church is believed  
 to date from the middle of the twelfth
 century.The Norman nave is            
 particularly distinctive with round   
 pillars, a high roof and a fully      
 preserved clerestory. The transept and
 chancel were both added in the        
 fourteenth century.                   
     There is also a parish church in  
 Hodthorpe.                            
 Apart from the Anglican churches,     
 there is a{Methodist church}in        
 Whitwell. The chapel has regular      
 coffee mornings and charity raising   
 activities. The old Methodist church  
 is now used as a civic centre, where a
 wide range of community meetings are  
 held.
