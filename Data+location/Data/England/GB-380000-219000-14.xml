		<title>14Childrens' Games-Gloucester</title>
		<content>    Years ago children amused          
 themselves by playing games with their
 friends outside in the street.They    
 invented these games themselves.Games 
 like{"Catch", "Hop-scotch","Kerby",   
{"British Bull dogs","Marbles","Hide   
{and Seek","Skipping","Tag",and lots   
 more.Kerby is a ball game played      
 across the street from one kerb to    
 another. You throw a ball at the      
 opposite kerb.If it hits you get one  
 point.If it bounces back and you catch
 it you get two points.Nowadays we have
 toys to amuse us,but we still go out  
 in the streets to play with our       
 friends.And we still play some of the 
 old games,but we have thought of many 
 others to replace them.               
   {Marbles -}Was played in Roman times
 The idea of the game was to make a    
 circle of marbles.You roll your marble
 in,trying to hit the other marbles out</content>
