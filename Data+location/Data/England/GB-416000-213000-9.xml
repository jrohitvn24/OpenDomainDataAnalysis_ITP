		<title>09A DAY IN THE LIFE OF SARAH</title>
		<content>      I wake up about eight o'clock I  
 go down stairs and get my breakfast,I 
 watch 'Breakfast Time' on TV.         
 Afterwards I go and get dressed, and  
 then go downstairs and help mum with  
 the jobs like tidying and dusting.    
 When I have finished I go and find my 
 friend,Tara, and we go for a bike ride
 along the village road or the lane    
 towards Farmington.We ride and play   
 till dinner time.Then we go to our    
 homes and have dinner.In the afternoon
 we usually play again.Sometimes we go 
 and see my aunt and uncle.They live in
 Shurdington near Cheltenham.We stay   
 till eight o'clock and then we get in 
 our car and we come home.I sit and    
 watch television with mum and dad.Then
 I have a drink of coffee and get ready
 for bed.At nine o'clock I go to bed.
