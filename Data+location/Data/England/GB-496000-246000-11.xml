		<content> Since the village school closed in    
 1983 the building has become the      
 Community Centre and the committee    
 faced with the task of raising money  
 for its conversion.Building work on   
 the fire exits and car park is        
 currently in progress, partly financed
 by a council grant but more money is  
 needed for improving heating,kitchen, 
 general equipment and storage.        
 Fund raising events this year have    
 included a Sunday lunch at Firs Farm  
 where 125 people enjoyed Roast Turkey,
 vegetables and sweet for Â£3.50 which  
 raised around Â£300.350 people attended
 the Barn Dance in July at Bunyan Farm 
 which raised Â£500.The Grand Raffle,   
 with first prize of a weekend in      
 Amsterdam took place during the       
 evening nd raised Â£650.The next event 
 is a race evening.
