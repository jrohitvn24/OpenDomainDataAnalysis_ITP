		<title>05      NEWTON KYME VILLAGE</title>
		<content>      Newton Kyme is a tranquil country
 village nestling among the wooded     
 parkland.  The houses are grouped in  
 clusters.  All the houses are stone   
 built, the newer ones being blended in
 with the old. Many of the houses are  
 detached and have an old world charm  
 with their ivy, wisteria and creeper  
 clad walls.                           
                                       
      Newton Kyme is an historic       
 village. In Norman times there was a  
 castle and Manor House and today there
 are just the remains of a moat. The   
 church is tucked away behind Newton   
 Kyme Hall (where they hold functions  
 and other private meetings). Inside   
 their are well preserved wooden       
 carvings.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
