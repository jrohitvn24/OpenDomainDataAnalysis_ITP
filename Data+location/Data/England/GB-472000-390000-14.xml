		<title>14Thoughts &amp; Sayings:Gringley</title>
		<content>{ THOUGHTS}:Some young people feel that
 more baby swings,more football,Cubs,  
 Brownies &amp; Guide Packs,a young drama  
 group,&amp; a leisure centre would help to
 improve their village.Some elderly    
 people feel that more social events,a 
 better bus service,bowling green,OAP  
 Centre would improve the village.Some 
 adults think there is too much litter/
 aircraft &amp; traffic noise;they'd also  
 like piped gas and more village shops.
{SAYINGS}:The cross on Cross Hill is   
 called "The Butter Cross" by locals   
 but it isn't authentic.They believe   
{either}that it is a place where       
 priests collected rents from market   
 stalls{or}a memorial to the wife of   
 an English King who died soon after   
 a journey which included Gringley{or  
 a place of prayer before farmers went 
 to market{or}a place where women made 
 butter,cheese &amp; flour.                </content>
