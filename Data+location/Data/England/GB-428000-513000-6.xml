      {Dirk Pittaway,}had just restored
 his 40 year old{butcher's bike. }He   
 said it was a lot easier to deliver   
 his goods to restaurants on a bike    
 rather than in a car.  While he was   
 delivering some goods, he left his    
 bike outside of a shop and it was     
 stolen.                               
                                       
       Later, Dirk Pittaway, the       
 butcher, received a phone call from a 
 man who said that he had seen a bike  
 and immediately recognised it to be   
 Dirk Pittaway's.  Mr Pittaway phoned  
 the police and they soon got to work  
 and recovered his bike.  The name     
 plate was missing but otherwise there 
 was no damage done to the bike itself.
