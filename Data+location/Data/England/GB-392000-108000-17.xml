		<title>17TRAFFIC THRU TARRANT HINTON</title>
		<content> Four of us,Karl,Paul,Wayne and        
 me Matthew,did a traffic survey at    
 Tarrant Hinton.We sat at the side of  
 the A354 main road between Salisbury  
 and Blandford and two of us counted   
 the traffic going to Salisbury and the
 other two counted the traffic going to
 Blandford.We timed ourselvesand spent 
 an hour counting.In the hour going to 
 Salisbury there were 118 cars,17      
 lorries,10 vans,3 motorcycles,3 buses 
 and 3 bikes while going to Blandford  
 were 90 cars,10 lorries,5 vans,3      
 motorcycles,2 bikes and 3 farm        
 vehicles.We expected more traffic but 
 perhaps because it was mid morning    
 10.30 to 11.30 am and a Tuesday the   
 traffic was light.We thought that     
 there would be more tractors as there 
 are so many farms but perhaps they use
 farm tracks instead.
