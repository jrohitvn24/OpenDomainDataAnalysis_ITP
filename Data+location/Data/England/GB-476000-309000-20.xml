		<content>We built a new roof and put in some    
insulation and built a new chimney. We 
had a new fire place put in and when we
completed the house we pebble dashed   
it. My mum decorated the house and nana
helped her.  In 1985 we bought the     
house on the other side of our original
house.  This house has five rooms      
altogether.  We have started on the    
garden which is going to be a vegetable
patch.  So three houses have become    
only one house for our family of six.  
                                       
Now Dad has demolished the pig sty at  
the bottom of the Quaker house and is  
landscaping the garden.  The whole lot 
is now called Holly Cottage.
