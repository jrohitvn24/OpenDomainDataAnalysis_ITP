		<content> Twenty-four parents of children in    
 this school have allotments. The      
 Council have three sites known as     
 "Harewood","Andrew", and "Foggins",   
 named after the people who owned the  
 land. The tenants are allowed to keep 
 pigs and hens, but not cockerels. Some
 gardens are let to the Homing Society.
 They are allowed to have pigeon lofts 
 and regularly race their birds.
