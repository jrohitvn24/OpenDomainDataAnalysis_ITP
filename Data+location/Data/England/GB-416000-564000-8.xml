		<content>   The teenagers enjoy stunt riding on 
 the Newburn B.M.X.track.              
   In this square there are 7 Scout and
 Cub groups,while for girls there are  
 13 Brownie packs and 9 Guide          
 groups.This year June 23rd-30th is the
 75th anniversary of guiding.Princess  
 Margaret lit a flame in London which  
 was then taken by helicopter to York  
 and other cities.Mrs.Robinson,the     
 Divisional Commissioner is spreading  
 the flame from Denton Burn Library to 
 each group in her division.           
   There are several youth clubs held  
 in local schools,community centres and
 church halls.Karate and Judo appeal to
 many boys.                            
   At home many watch T.V.and videos.  
   There is a feeling that in the      
 future there will be more leisure     
 time.People of all ages will have to  
 find more leisure activities.         </content>
