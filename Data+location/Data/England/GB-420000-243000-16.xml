{Birds}.Most wild birds are found in   
 the district in large numbers.Recent  
 additions are water fowl such as      
 Canada geese, mallards and many       
 varieties of ducks (see p.13{ILMINGTON
{LAKES}).Fieldfares and redwings are   
 winter visitors.                      
{Trees}.The most noticeable omission is
 the elm from which the village was    
 named.Dutch elm disease killed all of 
 them.A recent addition is the maple.  
{Wildflowers}.All the common flowers   
 are to be found and now cowslips,     
 which were becoming rare, are         
 flourishing again.Before the use of   
 sprays orchids were to be found but   
 they have vanished completely.        
{Animals}.Most species are flourishing.
 Otters have now disappeared but a new 
 addition is deer which have escaped   
 from parks and are thriving locally.  </content>
