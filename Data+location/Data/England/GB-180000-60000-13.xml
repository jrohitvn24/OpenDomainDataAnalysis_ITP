		<title>13Newquay's views on Violence</title>
		<content>    After the terrifying events at the 
 European Cup Final in Brussels,concern
 was expressed over football violence.A
 survey was conducted to discover how  
 people felt.Our results were not      
 conclusive,but interesting.Out of the 
 hundred people interviewed,48 came    
 from Cornwall.53 men and 42 women took
 part-some couldn't decide!            
                                       
    Alcohol was thought to be the main 
 cause(80),but some who thought so,    
 didn't think it should be banned,and  
 some who didn't thought it should be! 
                                       
    A majority were against electric   
 fences(67),but for ID cards(55) and   
 having all-ticket matches(72).More men
 than women wanted electric fences and 
 less women than men were against the  
 World Cup ban.More men(20_11) thought 
 that unemployment was a factor.       </content>
