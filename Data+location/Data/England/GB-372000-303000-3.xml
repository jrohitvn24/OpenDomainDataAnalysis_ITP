		<title>03HOUSING IN KEMBERTON</title>
		<content>  Kemberton has 92 houses 79 of which  
 are owner-occupied.                   
  Kemberton Hall Farm is a 16th century
 house and there are the sites of at   
 least 3 other 16th century buildings. 
 One cottage has been converted into a 
 bungalow and two others,which were    
 damaged by fire in the 1940s, have    
 been rebuilt as one dwelling.         
  Many houses were built in the 18th   
 or 19th century.They are nearly all   
 detached and range from cottages to   
 large houses such as Kemberton Hall.  
 The Cedars and Kemberton House are    
 substantial 18th century farmhouses,  
 the land to which has now been sold.  
  There is one terrace of 6 cottages   
 built about 1810 which has been       
 converted into 3 larger dwellings. One
 of these was an abattoir and another  
 was,until recently,the village shop.
