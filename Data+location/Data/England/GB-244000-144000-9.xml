		<content>     It is difficult to find any       
 substantiated stories of the super-   
 natural in Mortehoe.  It is generally 
 agreed that a lady born about a       
 hundred years ago and still remembered
 by some residents had the power to    
 "put a curse" on people who upset her,
 but the curses appear to have been    
 short-lived. Yarde Farm, which is one 
 of the oldest houses in the area, is  
 reputed to be haunted and as recently 
 as the 1950s when farms held Harvest  
 Suppers for those who had helped      
 gather the harvest the workers were   
 always anxious to hurry away before   
 moonrise. There is a "long room" at   
 Yarde where, if small children are put
 to bed, they waken in the night in    
 tears. The son of a resident remembers
 crying when he saw a vision of a "lady
 in grey", the ghost of a lady from a  
 shipwreck at Bennet's Mouth.          </content>
