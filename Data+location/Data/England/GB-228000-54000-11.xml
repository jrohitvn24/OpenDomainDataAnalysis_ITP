		<title>11RECREATION  DOWNDERRY/SEATON</title>
		<content> The lack of flat land make formal     
 outdoor recreation difficult.Soccer   
 and cricket have had village          
 teams playing on pitches well away    
 from the settlement.Indoor sports are 
 more popular and there are local teams
 for billiards,snooker,pool,badminton  
 and darts.Some tennis,short tennis and
 table tennis is possible. Informal    
 recreation often involves the sea     
 where fishing,sailing and boating are 
 popular.Pigeon &amp; pheasant shoots occur
 Amateur drama is making a welcome     
 return with a 1985 Xmas pantomime     
  Ladies groups have organised leisure 
 societies with craft and discussion   
 groups.For men ,apart from the sports 
 mentioned above the pub and the       
 country club are the main alternatives
 from the garden and the television.   
 Fortunately other facilities e.g. golf
 squash,chess are available nearby.    </content>
