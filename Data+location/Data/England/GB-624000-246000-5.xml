		<title>05 FAMILY LIFE- WOODBRIDGE</title>
		<content> On Sunday I get up about 8 and help my
dad get breakfast ready. When Mum's    
bacon, egg, tomatoes and fried bread is
cooked I take them to her bedroom along
with the Sunday Mirror newspaper. My   
dad has the same as my mum to eat, but 
I have a bacon omelette. I get dressed 
and do a few jobs such as washing up,  
making my bed and cleaning the car. I  
then play Formula One on the Spectrum  
computer until twelve noon. Lunch is   
between twelve noon and one thirty. We 
have roast and sometimes a sweet. After
lunch I wash up and then watch Sunday  
Grandstand on TV. If there is nothing I
like on that, I play the board game    
Turbo. For tea I have sandwiches. After
tea I watch TV on my portable until    
eight thirty and then read in  bed     
until eight forty-five and then I go to
sleep.
