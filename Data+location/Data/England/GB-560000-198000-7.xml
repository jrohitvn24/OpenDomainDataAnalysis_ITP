 of a 15th century priory .            
    It is conveniently situated for the
 M25 and the A12 London to Chelmsford  
 road and offers many facilities. Apart
 from hotel and restaurant             
 accommodation, up to 500 guests can be
 catered for at a dinner-dance. Parties
 in the restaurant can have a choice of
 8 menus, while the Banqueting menu    
 offers a choice of 36 different       
 combinations.
