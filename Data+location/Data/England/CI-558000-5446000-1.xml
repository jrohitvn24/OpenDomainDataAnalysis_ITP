		<title>01OUR 'D' BLOCK</title>
		<content>  Our 'D' block is in the south west   
 part of the island of Jersey. Well    
 over half of the block is sea. The    
 'D'block covers St. Brelade's Bay, the
 rugged headland of Noirmont and the   
 old village and harbour of St.        
 Aubin. The sandy beach of St.         
 Brelade's Bay is a great tourist      
 attraction, and in the summer is      
 crowded with visitors sunbathing,     
 swimming, or taking part in water     
 sports. The craggy cliffs provide     
 homes for seagulls, and the gorse     
 covered headlands have many lovely    
 walks. Scattered about the headlands  
 are many old war-time fortifications. 
 The picturesque St. Aubin's village is
 another tourist attraction with its   
 old houses, pubs, shops and boat      
 filled harbour. 400 metres off-shore  
 is St. Aubin's fort, now used         
 as a centre for school field trips.   </content>
