		<content> Wakes Day is by far the most important
 social event in the community village 
 year.  The Wake being a relic of an   
 early religious festival all the money
 raised on this day goes towards Church
 Funds and the upkeep of the Everest   
 Hall.                                 
 Activities take the forms of stalls   
 run by the parishioners selling a     
 variety of goods.                     
 In the Autumn a well attended Harvest 
 Festival Supper follows the Church    
 Service.  Early in December a         
 Christmas Bring and Buy Sale is       
 followed by an Auction.               
 During the year a number of concerts  
 take place at which our Choir takes   
 part.  Autumn evening classes are     
 organised by the W.I. and are always  
 popular.  In 1985 it is Country       
 Dancing.                              
                                       </content>
