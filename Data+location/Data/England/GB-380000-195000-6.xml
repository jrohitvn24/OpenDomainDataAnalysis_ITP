		<content> A long barrow and several tumuli are  
 evidence of stone age and bronze age  
 settlement, and a major Roman site has
 been recently excavated. The earliest 
 written reference is the Domesday Book
 which records that"IN CHINGSCOTE 4 1/2
 HIDES"had belonged to King Edwards    
 estates at Berkley.  This figure      
 agrees well with the 730 hectares of  
 the present parish.                   
{Religion.} The parish church is dated 
 to the 12th c. but has known many     
 alterations since and suffered major  
 restoration in the 19th c. the tower  
 is largely intact from the 13th or    
 14th c.                               
{Biography.} Edward Jenner(small pox   
 vaccine)married Catherine Kingscote   
 here in 1788.  Her family held the    
 manor from the 12th c. to 1956, but in
 1807 built a Georgian mansion"The     
 Grange" and a racecourse in the park. </content>
