		<content>  St.Andrews Church suffered a terrible
 fire in 1934,which destroyed most of  
 the woodwork and stone mouldings.     
 Yet by 1936,the Parish had built a    
 new modern church. For nearly 1000    
 years,the local inhabitants have      
 worshipped at the church.The tower was
 built in 1726-this date is inscribed  
 on the sundial south of the church.It 
 holds three bells,one from 1601,one   
 from 1651 and one of an uncertain     
 date.All the bells were recast in     
 1936.The walls are all Saxon,and are  
 good examples of the architectural    
 style of this period.                 
    The North Door is sometimes called 
 The Devil's Door because according    
 to local tradition,it allows the      
 Devil to leave a child when he or she 
 is baptised.The church also contains  
 memorials from both the First         
 and Second World War.                 </content>
