{FIR TREE FARM:}A few hens are kept to 
 provide eggs for the farmer's own use.
  There is no hired help in the house. 
                                       
{WILLOW HOUSE FARM:}The farmhouse was  
 greatly extended in 1984.  Being a    
 corner site, one house had to be      
 demolished to make room for the       
 extension.                            
                                       
{MANOR FARM:}The house still stands as 
 it was built in the early 1800's,     
 having been modernised but not        
 extended.  There are no Deeds to this 
 house as they were lost when the      
 Solicitors in High Street, Hull were  
 flooded in 1921.  At present the      
 rafters of the house are home for a   
 colony of nursing bats, around 100    
 having been counted in August 1985.   </content>
