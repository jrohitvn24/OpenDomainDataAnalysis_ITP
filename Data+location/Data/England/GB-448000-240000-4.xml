		<content>{Midsummer Festival 1985}              
Middleton Primary School holds a       
festival every year. This year the     
theme was children's games. The Fourth 
Year children wrote letters to         
newspapers, societies, T.V. and radio  
programmes. Many replies were received 
and many appeals broadcast on radio and
T.V. Six children collected together   
the information. Some of the games sent
in or found in books were performed.   
Morris and Maypole dancers danced.     
Third Year children performed skipping 
games to rhymes such as, "On A         
Hillside", "Blackcurrant, Redcurrant"  
and "Georgie Porgie". Other children   
performed singing and chanting games.  
Many purely local games were performed.
The information collected is to be put 
into a book and stored for posterity.
