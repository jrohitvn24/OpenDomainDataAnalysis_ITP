 Springfield near Winster post office  
 pottery birds are made for sale. Mr   
 Sefton at the east end of Green Lane  
 makes harpsichords, and also takes    
 pupils to learn how to play one. At   
 Wilds Farm near the Winster main guide
 post the son of Wild does metal work  
 and acts as village and area
