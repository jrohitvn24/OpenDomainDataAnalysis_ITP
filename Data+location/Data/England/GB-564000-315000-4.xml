		<content>  The great majority of inhabitants of 
 the village work in the factories,    
 shops, and offices in{Kings Lynn.     
  There is very little employment      
 available in the villages themselves. 
 In Middleton the{school}employs four  
 teachers and a secretary  and there is
 a{petrol station}which employs four   
 people.The Crown{public House}employs 
 three people but none of them live in 
 the village.The{village shop}in       
 Middleton employs one lady who lives  
 in the village.The garage in Middleton
 did employ people but is now closing  
 down because of declining business.   
 North Runcton has no employers except 
 the farmers and the sports club.      
  The{farms}were the main employers    
 until about 40 years  ago but now many
 farms are worked without any hired    
 help and few farms employ more than   
 two or three men.                     </content>
