   The Kilsby and Barby Chess Club     
 meets every Monday. It is for school  
 children but anyone would be welcome. 
 Mr.Hatton is the organiser.           
                                       
   Mr.Hatton teaches the beginners. The
 better children sometimes play        
 tournaments or try to solve puzzles.  
                                       
   Sometimes matches are organised     
 against other clubs, usually Bilton or
 Braunston. Several of the children in 
 the club have been selected to play   
 for the county.                       
                                       
   Chess in our area is very strong and
 is likely to improve with the starting
 of a new schools' Chess league!
