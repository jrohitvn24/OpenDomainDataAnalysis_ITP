		<content>       Mrs J Bailey has lived in an old
 peoples Bungalow for two and a half   
 years before that she lived in a      
 larger council house in Brookside. She
 likes living there very much because  
 there are lots of homes nearby and she
 is not lonely. She goes to a          
 Friendship Club, Mother's Union and   
 her husband goes to Whist Drives      
 &lt;which is cards> and bingo. When she  
 needs shopping she goes on the bus    
 to Bishop Stortford because she has   
 not got a car. Her hobbies are        
 looking after the other people in     
 the bungalows.She does not have       
 Meals on Wheels because she can cook  
 her own meals.
