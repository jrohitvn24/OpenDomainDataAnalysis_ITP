		<content> Primary schools are not really        
 affected except that the teachers are 
 not doing any outside school          
 activities. We sometimes go on trips  
 to theatres or historical places. When
 we're in the fourth year we go on a   
 four_day trip and stay at a hostel. We
 do work on the trip when we come back 
 and write diaries of what we have done
 each day. The last afternoon of each  
 term we are allowed to bring our own  
 games to play. In the last week of the
 summer term we have a Summer Fair.    
 Everyone helps. We run our own stalls,
 which are usually small games. The    
 money we get from the stalls goes     
 towards the school funds. We have a   
 school sports day every year with 4   
 teams out of each class competing     
 against each other. We have our own   
 school swimming pool which is quite   
 small but we all enjoy using it.      </content>
