		<title>09Recreation in Rishton</title>
		<content>                                       
  In Rishton there is quite a variety  
of recreation. The three most popular  
are Enfield and Rishton Cricket Clubs  
and Clayton Harriers, which is         
nationally known. There are other clubs
not as frequently used but still very  
popular like the squash, golf,         
horticultural clubs and evening        
classes. The canal is used for         
canoeing, fishing and other things.    
Children can go to youth clubs and     
guide and scout groups and for younger 
children the playgroup. For boys there 
various football teams to choose from  
and girls can join the Rishton netball 
teams. In parks there are very few     
things, which is a disappointment. For 
older people there are whist and       
dominoe drives at the Old Folk's Centre
which are very well supported.
