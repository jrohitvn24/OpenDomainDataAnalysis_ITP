		<content>{Winters Farmhouse}was built in 1660.  
 In the farmyard are concrete plum     
 silos built in the 1939-45 war.       
 Unfortunately no provision was made   
 for removing the plums at the bottom  
 so the structure proved useless. A    
 barn at Winters Farm is thatched with 
 heather and one at nearby{Merton Farm 
 with hop bindings. On Stone Street a  
 Roman road is{Iffin Farm}with 86 acres
 of fruit trees. The farmhouse dates   
 from 1750. The barns are roofed with  
 straw thatching and Kent Peg Tiles.   
 The new long straw thatching is       
 expected to last about 25 years.{Upper
{Horton Farm}has 330 acres mainly      
 arable. The farmhouse built in 1955   
 appears older but the 2 pairs of semi-
 detached farm houses built the same   
 year are typical of the period. The   
 Nissen Huts, built in the 2nd World   
 War, have been used as pig sties.     </content>
