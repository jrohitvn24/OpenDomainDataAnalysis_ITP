		<title>06Employment in N.St Ives</title>
		<content> The area of North St.Ives consists    
 of fields,two housing estates,a Royal 
 Air Force station and a few shops.    
 There are a few jobs on farms and in  
 shops but there are   many different  
 jobs at Royal Air Force Wyton.However 
 most people travel outside the area to
 work.Some people work at the Rainbow  
 Supermarket.Others travel to          
 Cambridge.                            
   In St.Ives it is mostly men who have
 jobs.These men chose their jobs       
 themselves.Some ladies work in shops. 
   Two people out of three thought they
 received fair pay.One person was      
 self-employed.Nobody worked a         
 night-shift.                          
   Only one person has been unemployed,
 but for only two weeks.               
  All the men liked their jobs.Many    
 mothers and fathers have professional 
 jobs,like teachers and managers.      </content>
