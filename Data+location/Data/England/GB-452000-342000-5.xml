		<content>{Babbington,}situated at Cinderhill is 
 one of the oldest working pits in     
 existence.It was sunk in 1841 by      
{Thomas North}who was a pioneer in     
 mining technology.It was the first pit
 to have{Tandem headgear,}powerful     
 winding engines, iron tubing in shafts
 to prevent water seepage, iron winding
 ropes, cages, underground mechanical  
 haulages, furnace ventilation,        
 underground gas lighting and the      
{Longwall system of mining.}Although   
 furnaces and gas have been taken over 
 by electricity, the original shafts,  
 known as Windy and Smokey are still in
 regular use. Windy sucked down air and
 Smokey acted as a chimney.Over a      
 century of spoil has been deposited to
 the North of the pit covering over    
 29,000 sq.metres. This is being       
 landscaped as the pit is nearing the  
 end of its working life.              </content>
