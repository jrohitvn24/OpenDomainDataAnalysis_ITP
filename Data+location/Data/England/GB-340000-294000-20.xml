		<title>20MEDLICOTT MANOR COPPER MINE</title>
		<content>                                       
   At{Medlicott Farm}there is an old   
{copper mine.}The mine is built into   
 the side of the hill-we call this an  
{adit mine.}They built it this way     
 because it was easier and cheaper.    
   There isn't much of the mine left   
 now;the waste is all grassed over and 
 the entrances are blocked up with     
 corrugated iron.                      
   The mine ran under the hall and     
 people living there could hear the    
 miners at work.                       
   The mine was shut down in the 1880's
 because they weren't making enough    
 money.They are now thinking of        
 re-opening it so they can start       
 producing copper again,as they are now
 able to get more copper out of the    
 rock using new methods.               
                                       
                                       </content>
