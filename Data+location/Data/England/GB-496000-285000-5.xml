		<content>{THE HISTORY OF THE NEW BIELD  }       
     The New Bield at Lyveden was built
 by Sir Thomas Tresham (1545-1605) as a
 garden house for the manor of Lyveden,
 the manor house (known as the Old     
 Bield) which was rebuilt by Sir       
 Thomas, and his second son Sir Lewis  
 Tresham,first Bart. It is a cruciform 
 building of stone,and measures some   
 70ft square. It stands on a hill.     
  The theme of the building is the     
 Passion and Death of Our Lord. It was 
 begun in 1594, and the work proceeded 
 slowly. The house was surrounded by   
 elaborate gardens. Work on the house  
 was going on in 1599, but received a  
 check when Sir Thomas was imprisoned  
 in 1600.
