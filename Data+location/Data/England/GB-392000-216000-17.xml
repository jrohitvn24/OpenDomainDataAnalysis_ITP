{opened on the 14th July 1951. The land
 6.23 acres of Glebe Land, was{bought  
 from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners 
{in 1948 for Â£580.}This was{money      
{raised by a Fund Sub-committee,       
{subscriptions from villagers}and a    
 grant from the King George's Field    
 Foundation.                           
 The layout was agreed to provide      
 cricket, football, hockey, netball and
 school organised games areas,         
 children's corner, tennis courts,

 school building was vacated in 1980.
