		<title>02WINSTANLEY HALL</title>
		<content>  Winstanley Hall is situated on the   
 south-western side of Wigan.It was    
 built in 1595.James Banks,a goldsmith 
 from London, bought the estate for    
 Â£3100.It has been in the hands of     
 the Banks family ever since.This      
 family also owns land in Scotland.Coal
 was mined on the Winstanley estate    
 from 1507.At the peak of production,6 
 pits were in operation.Much of the    
 estate is rented out to tenants for   
 farming.Captain James Banks,the last  
 occupier of the hall,died recently,   
 leaving the 80 room house empty.The   
 gardens now lie derelict and the house
 is for sale.There is no scope for     
 development of the estate,since the   
 house is a listed building.
