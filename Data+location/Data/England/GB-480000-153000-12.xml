		<title>12THE FLEET POLICE FORCE</title>
		<content> A force of 32 men and 3 women, working
 a three-shift day, are responsible for
{Law and Order}over 40 square miles in 
 and around Fleet.They operate from a  
 Station opened in 1967 on Crookham    
 Road near the town centre.To help them
 they have 3{patrol cars}(1 Volvo &amp; 2  
 Escorts) and 1 Transit van for moving 
 prisoners, though most{policemen}ride 
{bicycles}when on duty. On average, one
 arrest is made every two weeks,       
{prisoners}being kept in one of the 4  
 cells at the Station. The commonest   
{crimes}are shop-lifting and thefts    
 from cars. At the moment, tracing the 
 origin of forged Â£20 notes is taking  
 up most of their time. Serious crimes,
 like murder and rape, are rare in     
 Fleet and would be dealt with by      
 Winchester. There is no great drugs   
 problem here. Local support for the   
 police is strong.                     </content>
