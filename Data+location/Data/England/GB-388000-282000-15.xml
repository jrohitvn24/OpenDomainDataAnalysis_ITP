		<title>15HOME LIFE IN STOURBRIDGE</title>
		<content> My name is Bryan. I am aged 11. I wake
 at 07.15. I have breakfast and pack my
 school equipment.I leave home at 8.15.
 09.00{school}starts. We do P.E. Our   
 teacher sets us work (Maths). The     
{mornings}and{afternoons}in our school 
 seem long because our only break is at
 lunch time. At lunch time I play      
 cricket. I have lunch at 12.35, lunch 
 ends at 01.30. In the afternoon we do 
 English and complete Maths, then do   
 some topic work on the Domesday       
 Project. Sometimes after school I go  
 to Chawn Park and buy some sweets.    
 Then I go home and watch television. I
 have tea at 18.00 or 20.00. In the    
 evenings I play against my dad at     
 cricket. At 21.00 I come in and watch 
 television for a while. At around     
 22.00 I clean my teeth and go to bed. 
 In bed I read some comics until about 
 22.30. Then I go to sleep.            </content>
