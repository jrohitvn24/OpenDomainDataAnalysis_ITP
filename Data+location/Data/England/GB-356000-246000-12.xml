		<title>12Religion in the Felton Area</title>
		<content> The three churches in the area are the
 Church of St. Michael at Felton, Holy 
 Trinity Church at Preston Wynne and   
 St. James' Church at Ocle Pychard.    
 Sevices are held every fortnight and  
 at Christmas, Easter, Harvest Festival
 and Whitsuntide.  Although the habit  
 of regular attendance has largely     
 ceased, most people in the region are 
 communicants of the Anglican Church.  
 In the majority of families cremation 
 is chosen more often than burial in   
 the churchyard.  Fund-raising for the 
 churches is by donation, fetes, flower
 festivals and coffee mornings.  People
 are ready to support their church if  
 asked.
