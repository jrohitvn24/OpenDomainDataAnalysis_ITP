		<content>      The mainly{agricultural}landscape
 provides employment in farming,       
 horticulture and market gardening.    
      There are also the deposits of   
 clay, sand and gravel in the area     
 which give rise to the{extractive     
{industries.}The employment they       
 provide may be welcomed but there are 
 concerns among the rural residents    
 that the heavily-laden traffic that   
 they create and restoration plans for 
 extraction sites are problems that    
 need to be closely monitored.         
      Other than the{Michelmersh Brick 
{Company}and{Kent's Oak Mushroom Farm  
 there are no other major employers in 
 the area. A couple of garages and     
 individual businesses such as         
 decorators, electricians, plumbers and
 gardeners etc. provide some work, but 
 many of the residents work away from  
 the villages.                         </content>
