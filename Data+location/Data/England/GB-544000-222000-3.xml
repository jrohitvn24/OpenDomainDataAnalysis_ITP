		<content> back ownership of the estate and      
 was made Earl Of Essex by Charles II. 
     After the 1660's much of the      
 mansion was knocked down and the      
 estate divided into three farms.      
 Hadham Hall became a farmhouse for    
 tenant farmers,and remained so for    
 over 200 years.                       
    In 1900 the estate was sold to     
 Hugenot businessman William Minet. He 
 rebuilt the mansion and added to the  
 outbuildings. In both World Wars      
 Hadham Hall was used to house army    
 personel on training coures. Finally  
 daughter Susan Minet sold the hall to 
 the Hertfordshire County Council and a
 secondary school, with room for about 
 30 male boarders was opened in 1952.In
 1985 Hadham Hall School contains about
 400 pupils.
