		<title>17Nature Walk to the Castle.</title>
		<content>  It was a very boring morning, but it 
 brightened up when our teacher said we
 were going to{Hadleigh Castle}for a   
 nature walk.After a chat, we set off  
 in a crocodile-that means walking 2 by
 2.When we came to the end of the road,
 excitement bubbled because we could   
 begin searching under the hedgerows.  
 Our teacher called it a"mini-habitat".
 We caught all kinds of mini-beasts    
 like{beetles,bush crickets,wood lice, 
{slugs, snails and a glowworm.}We made 
 our way down to the castle through the
 kissing-gate where we fed the horses. 
 When we reached the castle, we did    
 some rubbings of the stones and       
 sketched some pictures for fifteen    
 minutes. Some children rolled down the
 hill! On our way back, we picked wild 
 flowers and interesting leaves. It was
 starting to rain on our return. Back  
 at school we sorted our collection.   </content>
