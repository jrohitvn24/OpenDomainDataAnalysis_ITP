		<title>02Shopping in Coulby Newham.</title>
		<content> The shopping facilities in Coulby     
 Newham are poor at present. A few     
 shops are dotted about in the estates 
 of Ash Hill, Fox Howe, Thistle Rise   
 and Hollowfield Square where you can  
 buy daily needs but for other things  
 you have to go to Middlesbrough. The  
 nearest chemist is at{Marton,}where a 
 small but busy shopping centre has a  
 number of different shops and services
 including a snack bar and a Chinese   
 take_away. However, a shopping centre 
 is being built in Coulby Newham and   
 will open in the Spring of 1986.      
 Called the{Parkway Centre,}it will    
 contain a Presto supermarket, 22 other
 shops, a social club, a public house  
 and a leisure centre. There will be   
 car parks which will take 565 cars, a 
 covered shopping mall and special     
 parking spaces for trolleys and       
 cycles.                               </content>
