		<title>16Interviewing Mrs Anstee</title>
		<content> Claire and I went to interview Mrs    
 Anstee, Claire's Gran. She said that  
 she did not go to Stanton School, she 
 went to{Grittleton,}and the{teachers  
 that she had were Mrs Amos, Mr Amos,  
 Mrs Archard, Miss Morris and Mrs      
 Alexander. She said that she wore a   
 dress with a pinafore and lace short  
 stockings. They played{games}like     
 Marbles, Skipping, Singing Games,     
 Whiptop, Hoop, London and other games.
 We asked her how long she had lived   
 here and she said since 1945, and she 
 said that Mr Anstee has lived here all
 his life. She{worked}at the Great     
 House. Then we asked her whether the  
 village has changed a lot, and much   
 has been added. She liked the village 
 now better than before. She didn't    
 have any evacuees in the{second world 
{war.}Her children came to Stanton     
 school, also her grandchildren.       </content>
