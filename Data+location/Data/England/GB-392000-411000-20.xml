		<title>20JOHN COLLIER - "TIM BOBBIN"</title>
		<content>   John Collier, who was the son of a  
 vicar and originally came from Urmston
 in Manchester, was one of Milnrow's   
 most famous figures. He began as a    
 schoolmaster in Milnrow on November   
 19th, 1729. While in Milnrow he began 
 writing books in Lancashire  dialect  
 and he used to illustrate his work    
 using cartoons and drawings. Some of  
 his work can be found in Rochdale     
 Library.                              
   John Collier was known as Tim       
 Bobbin. There is a public house of    
 this name in Milnrow today. He died on
 July 14th, 1786, aged 77 years. His   
 grave is in Rochdale churchyard.
