		<title>02A RAILWAY WORKER'S GHOST</title>
		<content> (The ghost of{John James,}a railway   
 labourer.)                            
 In the early 1970's, Wyn Snewin moved 
 into High Street.  Not long after     
 moving in, a man appeared in her room 
 one night.  He was bare to the waist  
 and wore labourer's coarse trousers   
 with a belt.  He had not a flicker of 
 expression and he seemed transparent: 
 the mirror could be seen behind him.  
 She said 'hello' to him, but he did   
 not answer and eventually she dropped 
 off to sleep.                         
 He reappeared a few weeks later -     
 again she said 'hello' but got no     
 response.  This time he turned towards
 the partition dividing the upper room 
 and disappeared through it.  He has   
 put in two or three more appearances, 
 but since the furniture has been moved
 around he has not been seen.
