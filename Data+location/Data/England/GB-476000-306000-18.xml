     Most people indulge in one or more
 outdoor leisure activity: gardening,  
 beekeeping, riding, walking, fishing, 
 shooting, hunting, scrambling,        
 birdwatching or cricket. The          
 Cottesmore Hunt meets regularly in the
 area and the Knossington cricket field
 is on the road to Owston. All houses  
 have gardens which are well kept and  
 several families own a green house    
 and/or stables.                       
  People belong to clubs and societies 
 according to their intrests, in       
 neighbouring villages and towns. Six  
 of the women belong to the Knossington
 Women's Institute and sewing, knitting
 , lacemaking, chess, reading, music   
 and other indoor activities are       
 pursued. The village hall is available
 for parties and discos. It is used by 
 children in the school holidays.      </content>
