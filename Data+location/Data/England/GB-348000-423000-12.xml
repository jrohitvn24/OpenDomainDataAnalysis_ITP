		<title>12LONGTON'S - PUBLIC HOUSES</title>
		<content>   IN LONGTON village the first of  six
 public   houses  is  the {RAM'S  HEAD.
   It started as a farmhouse which sold
 drinks and  has now  become  an eating
 house; a  favourite  place  for a game
 of pool  and to  listen to pop records
 with video. The next pub is a recently
 converted{MANSION HOUSE}which boasts a
 pup, a  wine bar  and  a carvery. This
 tries to  be a bit  up-market.  A very
 popular{BLACK BULL}displays photogaphs
 of 1869  when there  was a blacksmiths
 shop  attached, and  it  has  a  large
 upper  bay-window  which is said to be
 one of  the largest in existence.It is
 the only  establishment  where you can
 hire a private room.* The  other three
 pubs are out to the  west of our area.
 The {FARMERS ARMS}at  Whitestake (near
 New Longton)  is  well  known for good
 food and  is   very popular ( *{RED   
{LION; GOLDEN BALL; DOLPHIN})          </content>
