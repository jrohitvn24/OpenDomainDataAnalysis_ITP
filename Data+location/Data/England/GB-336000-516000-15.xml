		<content> THE POWER FOR PEOPLES HOUSES IS MAINLY
 DONE BY ELECTRICITY. OIL STOVES AND   
 OIL USED TO POWER THE HOUSES IN THE   
 OLDEN DAYS. AT PATTERDALE HALL IT IS  
 POWERED BY A LITTLE WATER MILL UNDER  
 GROUND. POWER FOR THE MINES WAS WATER 
 FROM RED TARN AND KEPPEL COVE. BUT THE
 DAM AT KEPPEL COVE BURST SO ALL THE   
 WATER HAD TO COME FROM RED TARN TO    
 POWER THE MINE. POWER FOR THE LAKE    
 STEAMERS IS DONE BY DIESEL,BUT IT USED
 TO BE BY COAL. JET ENGINES POWER THE  
 AIRCRAFTS THAT FLY LOW OVER HERE.     
 ENGINES AND PETROL ARE USED TO MAKE   
 CARS GO.  AS THIS IS AN INTERESTING   
 AREA FOR HOLIDAYMAKERS IT IS IMPORTANT
 TO MENTION THAT AN EVER-INCREASING WAY
 OF GETTING AROUND THE LAKE DISTRICT IS
 TO SIMPLY WALK.  THIS IS THE BEST WAY 
 TO SEE AND ENJOY THE COUNTRYSIDE.
