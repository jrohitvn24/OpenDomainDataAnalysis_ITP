		<title>02THE VILLAGE OF EAST LANGDON</title>
		<content> East Langdon is of Anglo-Saxon origin.
 The name Langandune meaning "At the   
 long hill" first appears in 861. It   
 did not appear in the original Survey 
 though the now extinct manor of       
 Pesinges, origin of the name of Poison
 Down and Wood, did. Well_established  
 by the 12th century the village has a 
 church dating from that time. Other   
 large buildings include a Primary     
 School, with 13 children aged 5-11,a  
 village hall,a general store and a    
 riding school. In this old farming    
 village there are also 2 farmhouses,13
 barns, 11 grain silos and numerous    
 sheds. Few of the 221 people who live 
 in the area of the village are        
 employed in farming. They live in 61  
 houses 19 of which are maintained by  
 the council. The main recreations are 
 gardening,DIY and handicraft. Other   
 interests are very diverse.           </content>
