		<title>19    Weston today</title>
		<content>   Weston-super-Mare is a seaside      
 resort.It is not as popular today as  
 it was after the war because many     
 people can now go abroad for their    
 holidays.                             
   But tourism is still a very         
 important part of Weston. In our class
 many children's parents are involved  
 in the holiday maker trade. Some own  
 gift shops others run guest houses and
 a few have restaurants.               
  As well as the interesting places we 
 have been studying in depth there are 
 many other places to visit. A         
 favourite with our class is the       
 Tropicana, which is an outside        
 swimming pool complex.
