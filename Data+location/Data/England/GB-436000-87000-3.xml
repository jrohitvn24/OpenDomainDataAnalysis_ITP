		<content> Yarmouth is one of the main ferry     
 points from which visitors travel to  
 and from the I.O.W. When a ferry docks
 at Yarmouth ,particularly during the  
 summer months, the roads heading      
 eastwards through our prescribed area 
 are very busy aithough they are narrow
 and in some cases contain rather sharp
 bends.                                
 Most cars we found took to the        
 northermost route to Newport.         
 Few seemed to stop in Yarmouth with   
 its narrow streets and one-way traffic
 system.                               
 On the northern edge -near the coast- 
 the council have provided two parking 
 areas which overlook the Solent.People
 can watch the boats pass by.They are  
 very popular with local residents as  
 well as visitors. There are no parking
 charges.
