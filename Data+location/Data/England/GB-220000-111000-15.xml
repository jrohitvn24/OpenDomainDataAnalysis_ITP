		<content> The {Reverend  Robert  Stephen  Hawker
 liked to leave crosses in his wake, as
 in the window of his cottage in{Coombe
 on the  gable of  the school  which he
 had built near{Shop}and in the Cornish
 cross  which he  had brought  from the
 moor to his churchyard in 1850.       
 With financial  aid from {King William
{VI}he built the bridge into the parish
 which crosses the river at{Coombe.    
{Hawker's Hut}of driftwood is  still to
 be seen on the top of{Vicarage Cliff. 
 He also constructed  the vicarage with
 its curious and unique chimneys.      
 Nearby is {St. John's Well}which still
 supplies  the church with  christening
 water.                                
{St Morwenna's Well }' halfway  down a 
 precipice ' is now alas dry.  However,
 the parish is host to a  much  greater
 stream.   On {Woolley moor }rises that
 seminal Cornish river,{The Tamar.     </content>
