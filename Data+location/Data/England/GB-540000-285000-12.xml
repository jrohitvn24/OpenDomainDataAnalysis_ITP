		<title>12Chatteris - Fens Land Use</title>
		<content> Since the begininning of the century  
 Nightlayer's Fen has been arable land.
  Birch Fen was used as pasture land   
 for cattle.  In the middle of the fen 
 was an old oak tree, only the stump   
 remains.  A private housing estate was
 built there during the 1960's.  The   
 Chatteris Urban District Council      
 rubbish dump was at Campole Hill,     
 south of Dean Hill.  Fenland District 
 Council closed it down as it was      
 infested with rats.                   
                                       
 Langwood Fen was owned by one farmer, 
 it produced potatoes, carrots,        
 sugarbeet, cereals and mangles.  Eel  
 Piece Pond and Langwood Hill Drove    
 were reached by footpaths from Wenny  
 Road and New Road.  It was a          
 popular place to walk to from         
 Chatteris.
