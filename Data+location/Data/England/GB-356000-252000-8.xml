		<title>08Education in Pencombe area</title>
		<content> There are no educational facilities in
 the map reference area. However pre-  
 school children can attend Pencombe   
 Playgroup which is run with voluntary 
 help in Pencombe Parish Hall. Most    
 children from the age of five attend  
 Pencombe CE Primary School. At the age
 of eleven the majority transfer to the
 Queen Elizabeth High School, Bromyard.
 A few children travel to secondary    
 schools in Leominster and Hereford.   
 Those wishing to continue their       
 education after sixteen years of age  
 have to travel to further education   
 colleges in Hereford. These include   
 the Sixth Form College, Catering      
 College, Technical and Art College,   
 College of Agriculture and the School 
 of Farriers. There are also day and   
 evening classes for people no longer  
 in full-time education but who wish to
 study various subjects.               </content>
