		<content>    People in Wilberfoss spend their   
 weekends in a great many different    
 ways.  Out of 140 people questioned   
 42 people worked all or part of the   
 weekend.  People were asked what      
 sports and pastimes they did in summer
 and winter.  Swimming was the most    
 popular sport in both seasons.        
    Gardening was the most popular     
 pastime in summer.  There are 2 garden
 centres in, or near, the village and  
 both are doing good business locally, 
 owing to the large number of people   
 who are interested in gardening. One  
 of the centres has been open since    
 1965,the other opened more recently.  
 The older of the two businesses stays 
 open from 0900 till 1900 and is open  
 seven days a week. It sells a wide    
 variety of plants and gardeneing      
 equipment. The other centre special-  
 ises in trees and shrubs.             </content>
