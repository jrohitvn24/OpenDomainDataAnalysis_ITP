 There are two popular amusement       
 arcades. You need at least Â£1 to enjoy
 them. Salisbury has 5 parks with      
 children's play areas, and four sports
 fields. The rivers Nadder, Avon and   
 Bourne, used by rowers, anglers and   
 sea scouts run through the city. The  
 swimming pool and sports centres are  
 popular with residents; gliding and   
 horse riding may be enjoyed on the    
 outskirts, although Salisbury's locals
 generally prefer a change of scenery  
 at holiday time.
