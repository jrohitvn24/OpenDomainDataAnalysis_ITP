		<content> This{limestone quarry}is owned by     
 the Tarmac International Company .It  
 is 30 acres of land. The quarry is 52 
 feet deep . There are 18 men and one  
 woman working there.{Tarmac Roadstone 
 has worked there for about 18 years.  
 The limestone is used for roads, con- 
 struction and agriculteral purposes.  
 The process begins by taking off the  
 surface soil. Then holes are drilled  
 to blast the rock. The explosives that
 they use are called {anfo}and{slurry. 
 The rock is transported to a primary  
 crusher then to a secondary crusher.  
 These break it down into 8 different  
 sizes. It is stored in 1000 tonne bins
 before being sold. Some chippings, how
 -ever are mixed with{Bitumen}to make  
 road surfacing materials.             
 The stone is carted away in 10,16 and 
 20 ton trucks.
