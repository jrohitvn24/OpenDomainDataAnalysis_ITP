		<content>  The west side of Crab Wood is called 
 West Wood and is managed by the       
 Forestry Commission.This area is not a
 nature reserve and people are         
 encouraged to this part.There is a car
 park, barbeque area and lots of bridle
 paths and foot paths.                 
  When the blue bells and primroses are
 out in flower in Crab Wood it is very 
 beautiful and when the sun is shining 
 it is even more beautiful.            
  Crab Wood is a lovely place for      
 tourists to visit and as it is not    
 very far from Winchester people can   
 easily get there.
