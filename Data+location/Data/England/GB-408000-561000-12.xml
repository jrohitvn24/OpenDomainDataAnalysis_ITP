		<title>12TYNE VALLEY RAILWAY</title>
		<content> The railway line was fully opened 139 
 years ago, but Prudhoe Station did not
 open until later. The line is used by 
 over 50 passenger and goods trains    
 daily (fewer on Sundays). Not all of  
 the trains travel the full distance   
 between Newcastle and Carlisle as some
 stop at Hexham. Passengers mostly pay 
 on the train because the ticket office
 at Prudhoe closed several years ago.  
 Most travellers were happy with the   
 service, but some were not happy about
 cleanliness on the trains. The trains 
 were usually on time, except those    
 from Carlisle which were sometimes a  
 little late.                          
    The station has unfortunately been 
 vandalised and the furniture is       
 covered in graffiti. Nowadays, only   
 the three signalmen work at the       
 station whilst a driver and conductor 
 operate the trains.                   </content>
