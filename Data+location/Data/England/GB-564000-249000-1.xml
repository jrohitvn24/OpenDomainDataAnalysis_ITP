		<title>01Introduction to Thurlow</title>
		<content> Our block covers the gently rolling   
 countryside so typical of Suffolk with
 the River Stour and several small     
 tributaries cutting the land from over
 350 ft at the western end of the block
 to a valley of under 250ft at its     
 eastern end, along which the river    
 flows south. The aspect is mainly a   
 patchwork of fields undercultivated   
 with original hedgerows and small     
 wooded areas. This pleasant landscape 
 is part of a large estate farmed as   
 economically and efficiently as any   
 land in Europe. A few farmhouses and  
 isolated cottages dot the countryside 
 with the one small hamlet of Carlton  
 Green but most of the habitation is   
 concentrated in the adjoining villages
 of Great and Little Thurlow, with most
 houses sited in the long main street, 
 their style showing a charming mixture
 of English cottage architecture.      </content>
