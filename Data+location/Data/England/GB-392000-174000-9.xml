		<content>  The{River Avon}flows roughly from    
 North to South through the Eastern    
 half of the block. It is used by      
 fishing and canoeing clubs as well as 
 for irrigation by local farmers.      
  Of the flat clayey land 51% is       
{arable,}growing mainly wheat with some
 barley and potatoes. There is a       
 developing vineyard at Tytherton      
 Lucas. 34% of the land is{grassland   
 for Friesan dairy cows and breeding   
 Herefords and several are used for    
 rearing pheasants for shooting.       
  The remaining 15% is covered by      
 roads, the mainline railway from the  
 west to London, houses and gardens and
 small patches of woodland used as     
 cover for foxes and pheasants.        
  Most of the area is hunted by the    
 Duke of Beaufort's fox hounds and the 
 Marlborough College Beagles.
