		<title>19HOUSING IN STAMBOURNE</title>
		<content>  There are about 6 council houses in  
 this area of Stambourne: all the      
 others are in private ownership. There
 are some farmhouses and cottages      
 dating from the 16th &amp; 17th centuries,
 more from the 18th &amp; early 19th       
 centuries. Very few buildings date    
 from the period 1850-1950. There is   
 considerable modern development in    
 Dyer's End and Chapel End Way, much of
 it bungalows, with more houses in     
 Dyer's End. Under Essex County Council
 planning regulations, new building is 
 allowed only in the gaps between      
 existing houses - infill development. 
 This prevents encroachment on open    
 countryside, but can lead to cramped  
 development in the village area.
