		<content>  One of the attractions of Kingsclere 
 is the Downs which rise above the     
 village.There are gallops here which  
 are used by{Park House}stables for    
 training racehorses.                  
  One of the hobbies enjoyed in        
 Kingsclere is{birdwatching}on the     
 downs. There is a large variety of    
 birds including owls. Another hobby on
 the downs is{hang-gliding,}and people 
 also walk along the track, which is   
 part of a{long-distance walk}across   
 Hampshire.                            
  You can get nice views from on top of
 the downs towards Didcot with its     
 power station cooling towers,in the   
 Berkshire Downs. Many people use the  
 two car parks by the road, and take   
 picnics on the downs.                 
{ Watership Down}is the place which was
 the setting for the book and film of  
 the same name.                        </content>
