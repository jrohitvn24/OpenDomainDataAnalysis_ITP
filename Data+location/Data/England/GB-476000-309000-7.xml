     The Brownie hut was built on      
chapel land.We have two leaders        
Tawnieowl and Brownowl;it starts at    
5:50 and ends at 7:00 it costs 20p     
We have got twenty Brownies and they   
come from Somerby, Twyford,Leesthorpe  
and Knossington.The hut has a main     
room, and one kitchen and one outside  
toilet.We sometimes go tracking and    
sometimes we go to the play area, but  
most of the time we stay at the hut and
play "Rats and rabbits","Man the ship  
and man the lifeboat",and lots of other
games.Every year we get a lift to      
Burrough Hill car park and walk over   
Burrough Hill to Little Dalby to       
Tawnies house.When we get there we     
have a picnic and play some games and  
sing songs.Then we go home.
