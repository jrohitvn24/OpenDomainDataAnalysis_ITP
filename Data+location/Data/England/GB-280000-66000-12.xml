		<title>12Ipplepen Quarry</title>
		<content>  There are many{disused quarries}in   
 this area. They were quarried for     
 limestone, the stone was burnt in     
 nearby lime kilns and the resulting   
 lime spread on the fields as a        
{fertilizer.}Many of the{kilns}here are
 in a good state of preservation.      
  The{quarry at Edgelands Lane}was used
 for this purpose but some of the rock 
 had been metamorphosized and worked as
 marble.This was known as{Ipplepen     
{Marble.}It seems that quarry records, 
 if they ever existed, have been lost. 
  The quarry was in production in the  
 mid 19th century.{Known examples}of   
 the marble are the fireplaces at Rose-
 mount,East Street and Apsley House,   
 Fore Street.The font of the parish    
 church Ottery St. Mary is also made of
 Ipplepen marble. The{last known pieces
 were used for the fireplaces Little   
 Pines, Rectory Road, East Ogwell.     </content>
