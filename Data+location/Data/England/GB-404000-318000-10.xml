		<title>10LIFE AND TIMES, RUGELEY</title>
		<content> Most people live and work in a routine
 during the working week (Monday to    
 Friday). School times are 9.00am to   
 4.00pm but vary by 10 minutes to allow
 parents to go from school to school.  
 Lunch time is about 75 minutes. Shops 
 open from 9.00am to 5.30pm generally  
 but newsagents open from 7.00am and   
 close later. Most shops close on      
 Sundays but about 5 general stores    
 around the town as well as garden     
 centres, DIY stores and discount      
 warehouses (carpets and furniture)    
 open long hours every day. Working    
 times are about 8.30am to 5.00pm but  
 many people work shifts at the        
 colliery and power stations. Public   
 houses open for 3 hours at lunch time 
 and from 6.00pm to 11.00pm, with      
 reduced times on Sunday. In the       
 evening many people watch television  
 which closes down at about midnight.  </content>
