		<content>   2000 years ago, Wincobank Hill was  
 used by the{Brigantes}as a{Hillfort,} 
 but when the{Romans}started attacking 
 them they used it as a{Signal Station.
   We went to the very top of Wincobank
 Hill and saw some remains of{ditches} 
 the Brigantes dug. It was very windy. 
 We could see nearly all round         
 Sheffield. We saw three blocks of{    
{flats}on the horizon that were like   
 birthday candles.                     
   From a very ancient{Hillfort}we     
 could see our modern city. There were 
 tall blocks of flats and the          
 Hallamshire Hospital, the M1 Motorway 
 with Tinsley Viaduct. We could see the
 steel factories in the Don Valley.    
   When World Championship Snooker is  
 televised, Wincobank Hill is still a{ 
{Signal Station.}Television pictures   
 are transmitted from the Crucible     
 Theatre and relayed on to London.     </content>
