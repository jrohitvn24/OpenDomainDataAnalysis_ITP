		<title>09A LOOK AT OVERY TOWN</title>
		<content> Overy Town is the small inland, older 
 portion of the Parish of Burnham      
 Overy.  It has a resident population  
 of only 50 and is situated mainly     
 along the A149 road from Burnham      
 Market to Wells-next-the-Sea.  On the 
 River Burn, which forms the Western   
 boundary, is one of two arable farms. 
 Until 1950 the owners were also       
 millers, grinding their own flour and 
 feedstuffs and supplying the area.    
 The water mill remains intact.  The   
 other farm is opposite the lovely old 
 Church of St. Clement with it's centre
 tower, and together with eight of the 
 cottages is owned by the Holkham      
 Estates.  Of the 42 properties        
 (constructed mainly of brick, flint   
 and chalk) only 26 are occupied, the  
 others being holiday homes.  Only 7   
 children of school age still live in  
 this mainly agricultural community.   </content>
