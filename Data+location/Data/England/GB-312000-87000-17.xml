		<title>17Sidmouth's Post Boxes.</title>
		<content>  There are 57 post boxes in the area  
 covered by the Sidmouth Sorting       
 Office. This area includes Sidmouth   
 itself, Sidford, Sidbury, Bowd and    
 Newton Poppleford. In this area there 
 are{7 Victorian boxes, 4 Edwardian    
 ones,{25 Georgian, 20 Elizabethan}and 
 1 which has not been traced. No       
 hexagonal{Victorian}boxes remain, but 
 there are 12 of the large cylindrical 
 boxes of various reigns and the rest  
 are wall mounted, post mounted or     
 built into buildings.                 
  Between the wars as areas were       
 modernised Victorian and Edwardian    
 boxes were replaced.  They did have a 
 slight disadvantage as it was possible
 to remove or vandalise the card       
 giving the time of collections.  Now  
 these old boxes are valued, are being 
 preserved and modified so that the    
 cards cannot be destroyed or removed. </content>
