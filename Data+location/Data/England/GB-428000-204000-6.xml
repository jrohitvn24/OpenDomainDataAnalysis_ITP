		<title>06CARTERTON TRADE AND COMMERCE</title>
		<content> The residents of{Carterton}do not     
 think that the{shopping}facilities are
 adequate for a town of its present    
 size. Most products are available but 
 there are very few outlets, therefore 
 the choice is more limited than in    
 Witney,a town of comparable size.     
{Carterton Chamber of Trade}assisted in
 the first{Carterton Trade Fair}held in
 May 1985. In the future it will be    
 held every other year. A committee    
 also organize an annual{Gala}in       
 Carterton,which is the town's main    
 summer social event. Both events are  
 to promote the town's commercial      
 potential. In recent years, Carterton 
 has attracted a fairly comprehensive  
 range of{professional services}. There
 are now solicitors,several banks,     
 estate agents,building societies and  
 an optician. The only things you can't
 buy in Carterton are jewels!          </content>
