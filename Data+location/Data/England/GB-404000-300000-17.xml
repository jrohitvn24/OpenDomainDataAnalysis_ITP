		<content>            {Tuesday}                  
 At 7.00 I get up and get dressed and  
 then I go down stairs. When it is 8.00
 I get my breakfast. I have coffee and 
 cheese on toast, then I watch the     
 video on the TV. At 8.40 I start my   
 journey to school. 9.00 and I start   
 school and Mr Whitehall calls the     
 register and then we line up for      
 assembly. We have a class assembly. At
 9.40 we come out of assembly and start
 our Fletcher maths and I am on        
 probability. At 10.30 we go outside   
 and play and every two weeks I go on  
 duty. At 10.45 we start our English.  
 At 12.00 I go home and have lunch. At 
 13.05 we go outside and do rounders   
 for an hour. At 14.30 we go out to    
 play for 15 minutes. Then at 14.45 we 
 do history with Mrs. Keats for half an
 hour. 15.25 and we go home. At 16.00 I
 watch television. 21.30 I go to bed.  </content>
