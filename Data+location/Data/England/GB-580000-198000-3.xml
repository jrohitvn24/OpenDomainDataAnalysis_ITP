		<title>03Great Hayes Farm</title>
		<content>{   Great Hayes Farm}is run by the     
 cowman Dennis Parkes. He looks after  
 181 Friesian cows and one Hereford    
 bull.  All the cows have names and Mr.
 Parkes remembers most of them. He also
 knows the nature of his cows and the  
 order they prefer for milking.        
    The farm covers 360 acres, of which
 200 acres is given over to grass. The 
 grass is cut in early summer to make  
 silage. This green grass ferments     
 under some black plastic held down by 
 many hundreds of tyres. In summer the 
 grass is cut for hay.                 
    The busiest time of the year is    
 between September to January, when the
 cows are calving.                     
    The cowman works a 13 hour day. He 
 brings the cows from the field at     
 5 a.m. and milks them at 5.30a.m. They
 are milked again in the evening and   
 returned to the field at 6.30p.m.     </content>
