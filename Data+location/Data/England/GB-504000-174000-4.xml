		<content> At the end of the war there was a     
 chronic shortage of houses in London. 
 Families were moved out of London and 
 into the surrounding countryside.     
 Houses were built at the end of       
 Stanwell nearest to Staines.          
 Heathrow was not very big at this time
 and gradually as it was expanded more 
 men were needed. This meant that      
 houses were needed so more were built.
 Today, Heathrow and all its associates
 are still the main employers of the   
 area .                                
                                       
{Recreation.}Stanwell has four parks,  
 Oaks road park, Lauser park, The      
 Church park and Cordelia park.        
 Cordelia park has a professional      
 cricket pitch, on which you can       
 usually find a game of cricket being  
 played at weekends. It also has an Air
 Cadet Corps stationed there.          </content>
