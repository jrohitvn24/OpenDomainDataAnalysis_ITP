		<title>14St. Martins Church East End.</title>
		<content>{St. Martins Church}is situated in East
 Woodhay. The exact date when built is 
 unknown but there was a church built  
 there in the 13th century and rebuilt 
 in 1823 because it was in a dangerous 
 state of repair.{The church}is 100    
 feet long And 45 feet wide.The tower  
 is about 50 feet tall. It has 6 bells 
 and 7 stained glass windows. In April 
 1912 a stained glass window was placed
 in the{church}dedicated to Bishop Ken.
 Bishop Ken was Rector of East Woodhay 
 from 1669 to 1672. He planted the     
 famous yew tree in the{church_yard,   
 this has since died. The wood was used
 to make a cross and the stump is      
 planted with flowers. The{church}plate
 was donated by the Goddards of        
 Stargroves in 1697. The bells were    
 made by John Corr, who had a bell     
 foundry at Aldbourne in Wiltshire from
 1728 to 1754.                         </content>
