		<title>10Flowers of Moorland Villages</title>
		<content> In the many habitats we find acid     
 loving plants, woodland,marsh species,
 and also the lime lovers,such as thyme
 which grow on the shallow layer of    
 soil above the limestone rock. These  
 flourish in the several quarries. The 
 famous heather moors are mostly ling  
 but there is also bell heather and    
 cross-leaved heath. Bilberries, crow- 
 berries,cowberries and sweet gale grow
 there. Bracken has increased greatly  
 over the years,possibly due partly to 
 it not being cut now. In springtime   
 violets, primroses, wood sorrel, wood 
 anemone,cowslips and celandine grow in
 profusion. False oxslips are in some  
 woods. Masses of wild daffodils grow  
 along the banks of the river from     
 Lowna northwards.This is the south end
 of the famous Farndale daffodils.     
 Later flowers include wild roses,     
 St.John's wort,guelder roses and more.</content>
