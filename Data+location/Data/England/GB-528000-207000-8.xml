		<title>08The Vicar of Bayford</title>
		<content>  We interviewed the Rev. John Cotton  
 and he told us the church serves the  
 parish of Bayford and Brickendon.     
  During the summer only{4 services}are
 held each month. The 3 winter services
 are                                   
 1st Sunday in month, Matins 11am      
 2nd Sunday in month, H.Communion 8am  
 4th Sunday in month,P.Communion 9:30am
 In summer 3rd Sunday in month Evensong
  The most popular services are Matins 
 and P. Communion with 20_25 people    
 attending each. Holy Communion has    
 just 7_8 people attending.            
  Bayford and Brickendon parish is a   
 member of{Hertford Hundred West group 
{of parishes}which was formed because  
 of{declining church attendance,}and   
 although numbers have gone up in      
 recent years a large percentage       
 attending are elderly. This is a cause
 for concern for the future.           </content>
