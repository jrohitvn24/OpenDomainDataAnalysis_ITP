		<content>{Stonely}has always been the home of   
 the farmers who worked the open fields
 at the east end of the parish.There   
 are fewer farmers today,but most of   
 them live in Stonely.However ,the     
 majority of the small-holdings have   
 exclusive houses on them now,and      
 attractive flower gardens have        
 replaced the vegetable plots.         
{Newtown,}first mentioned in           
 1279,appears to be a failed medieval  
 expansion. Its population remained    
 small until the last century when it  
 housed mostly artisans and            
 agricultural labourers. This          
 relatively humble origin is being     
 transformed at present with the steady
 introduction of executive housing.    
{Wornditch}has shrunk from what        
 was probably a separate estate of     
 perhaps twenty families in the Middle 
 Ages,to three houses today.           </content>
