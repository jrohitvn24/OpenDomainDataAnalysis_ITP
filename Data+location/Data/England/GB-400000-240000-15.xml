 OIL PIPELINE                          
                                       
 As we were making this survey we found
 a great line being cut across the     
 land. A very straight trench about 2  
 metres deep went far into the         
 distance. A yellow digger was scooping
 out clay and we found out that this is
 the route of an oil pipeline.         
 It is not for our area but will take  
 oil from a refinery near Southampton  
 to the industrial Midlands. When the  
 job is finished the pipe will be      
 completely hidden and the top soil    
 will be replaced to grow crops.       
 Oil is our main source of energy and  
 this pipe will deliver great          
 quantities of fuel without anyone on  
 the surface even knowing it is there.
