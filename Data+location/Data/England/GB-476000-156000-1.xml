		<content> Hartley Wintney has grown up where the
 A30 comes over the south western edge 
 of the Bagshot sands at Blackbushe and
 crosses the Fleet Rading Rd. north &amp;  
 east, the area rises over 300' in poor
 heath and conifer plantations, the and
 then falls rapidly to under 200' where
 the Hart river flows north west       
 eventually to te Thames. South west   
 the land is mainly hedged in to medium
 sized fields for mixed farming by     
 Elevethan Estate and independent      
 farmers.                              
 The population of about 4800 is       
 concentrated into south west corner   
 around a large village green with its 
 ranks of centuries old oaks, the shops
 and the road junctions. Apart from    
 village services, there is some local 
 employment in new, small hi tech      
 industries, but a large proportion    
 commute to London, Basingstoke        </content>
