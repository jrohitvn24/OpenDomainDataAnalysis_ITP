		<content>Farningham is one of the prettiest     
villages close to London. It is a      
conservation village, one of the 3     
protected villages in Kent.            
The old millhouse and the old houses by
the the bridge over the River Darent   
are always an attraction for visitors. 
The old manor house was once the house 
of Captain Bligh of the Bounty. Many of
the houses are timbered, weatherboard  
and Kentish Clapboard.                 
Many people visit the 13th century     
church which has a very special font   
and an alabaster memorial to the Roper 
Family, some people get permission to  
rub the very fine brass rubbings. In   
1984 there was a pageant to celebrate  
500 years of the church, it attracted  
many visitors. Morris dancers come to  
dance in the village every year at our 
village pub which is an old            
coaching-inn.                          </content>
