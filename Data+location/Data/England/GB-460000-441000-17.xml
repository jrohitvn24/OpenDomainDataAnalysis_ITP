		<title>17Escrick Estate today.</title>
		<content> By the 20th Century,Escrick Estate had
 facilities such as a gas house,       
 reservoir,generator,and the land owner
 could even stop and catch the mainline
 train which passed through his land.  
 Early in the 1940's,Escrick Hall was  
 considered too large for the family.It
 was divided into flats,then in 1948 it
 was leased,for use by Queen Margaret's
 School,to the Woodard Council who     
 finally bought it 10 years ago. The   
 Estate now owns 80 houses in Escrick, 
 50 on the Estate,all identifiable by  
 their blue paintwork.The Estate       
 employs a forester,three woodmen,a    
 gardener,a gamekeeper,two office      
 workers and ten farm workers. Mr.     
 Forbes-Adam now owns 7,000 acres,of   
 which 700 are woodland.It is          
 interesting to note that whereas once 
 60% of the remaining land was         
 grassland,now almost 100% is farmland.</content>
