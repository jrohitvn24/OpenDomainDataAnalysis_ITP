		<title>17GUIDE DOGS FOR THE BLIND</title>
		<content>    The lifeblood of Horwich in the    
 past has been its strong community    
 life.The group who carried out this   
 survey have concentrated on finding   
 out about voluntary and council old   
 folks' homes and pre-school childrens'
 playgroups.                           
    We have moulded plasticine at      
 Hilton Avenue Mums' and Toddlers'     
 Group,read stories in St.Catherine's  
 Church Hall,performed plays at        
 Flockton Court and made many friends  
 at Old Hall Crescent and the Manse    
 Private Rest Home.                    
    Eventually this interest in the    
 community has led us into charity     
 work.One of the most active in the    
 area is Guide Dogs For the Blind,     
 locally organised by the redoubtable  
 Mrs.Wooff who is blind herself but    
 inspires many to raise Â£1000 necessary
 to train each dog.                    </content>
