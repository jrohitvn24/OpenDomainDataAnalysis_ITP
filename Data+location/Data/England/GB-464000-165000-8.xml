		<content> Elizabeth is a pupil at Garland Junior
 School.Here,she describes a typical   
 day at school.                        
  "When we arrive at school we change  
 our shoes and line with our hymn books
 to go into assembly.Sometimes,classes 
 put on little plays,which are mostly  
 about Jesus and his followers.After   
 assembly we do Maths.At 10.45 we have 
 a break,and use this time to play with
 our friends from other classes.       
  "From 11.00 to 12.30 we do English.  
 Then we have a longer break.Some      
 people have packed lunches and some   
 prefer to have meals provided by our  
 school cook.In the afternoon we have  
 craft.Some make dolls or dinosaurs,   
 some make cardboard models,and some do
 calligraphy.At 3.00 we pack everything
 away,and the teacher reads our story  
 to us.At the moment we are reading    
 "The Hobbit" by J.R.Tolkein."         </content>
