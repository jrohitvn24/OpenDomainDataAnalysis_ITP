 At 1.30,the bell rang and we all lined
 up ready to go into school.           
 When we got into the classroom I was  
 in a group doing art and craft for the
 first lesson.After that we did some   
 Topic work and at 3.30 we went home.  
 When I got home I just played on the  
 front with a skipping rope then a     
 ball,then about 5.00 I had my tea.    
 I had salad then I played out again   
 until 9.00.I came in,had my supper    
 then went to bed at 9.30.
