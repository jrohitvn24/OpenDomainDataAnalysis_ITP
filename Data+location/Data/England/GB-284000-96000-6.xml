 find there are{no disadvantages.}Even 
 though there are{28 houses}in         
 Woodlands it is very{quiet.}          
  The older people in Woodlands think  
 there should be more shops in the     
 village.The people are{friendly.      
{ Behind most of}the houses are        
 pastures and meadows which the        
 residents like.It is said by some     
 people in Woodlands that the gardens  
 are not big enough.The{noise from the 
{Parish Hall}is sometimes annoying.    
  The houses are quite small so there  
 is a limit on how big your pets can   
 be.Sometimes when the children are    
 playing, the ball goes into other     
 people's gardens and they get         
 cross.The houses in Woodlands are     
 numbered.Each house has a{garage}which
 they find very useful,and{seven to    
{eight rooms.                          </content>
