		<title>06MORTHAM TOWER</title>
		<content> Mortham Tower stands on a knoll       
 overlooking the confluence of the     
 rivers Tees and Greta.  It was built  
 as a Peel Tower in about the 12th     
 century and sacked by the Scots after 
 Bannockburn in 1314.                  
 The Rokeby family house nearby was    
 also sacked about this time and the   
 Rokebys moved into Mortham, building  
 it up into a fortified Manor house    
 against further Scots forays.         
 Thomas Robinson bought the land after 
 the Civil War and built Rokeby Hall.  
 Mortham now fell into decay until in  
 1938 it was bought by William         
 Rhodes-Moorhouse whose plan to restore
 it was interrupted by the war of which
 he became a victim. After his mother's
 death in 1975, the restoration was    
 completed by the Batemans, the present
 owners, to make this one of the oldest
 inhabited houses in the north.        </content>
