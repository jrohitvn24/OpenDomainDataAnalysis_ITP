		<title>13Employment Opportunities</title>
		<content> Recently new firms have opened up in  
 the area offering{employment}to a few 
 local people but most people we talked
 to had to travel to work at{Rank Xerox
 in{Mitcheldean,Gloucester}or work from
 home. We asked the parents of our     
 schoolchildren and found that 25% of  
 fathers worked at{Rank Xerox},25% in{ 
{Gloucester}and 25% at or from         
 home.Local work was in farming, pubs, 
 small factories or as reps.. Many of  
 the women had to accept seasonal      
 part-time work picking produce or else
 travel to{Gloucester}.Some local firms
 were making fitted furniture, garden  
 ornaments and plant pots. We visited  
 several and one firm, which undertakes
 welding and farm building             
 constructions, is on a site in{       
{Longhope}where the jam factory was    
 situated.                             
                                       </content>
