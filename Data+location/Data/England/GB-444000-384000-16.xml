		<title>16The Miners Strike in Aston</title>
		<content> The nation-wide miners strike which   
 lasted a year and ended in March l985 
 was about pits closing down in the    
 area.  It caused a lot of hardship    
 because the families of striking      
 miners became very poor as they didn't
 have any money to buy clothes and     
 food.  When the children of working   
 miners went to school striking miners'
 children fell out with them and the   
 families got very angry with each     
 other.  Then it was the Police's turn 
 to be in trouble.  They arrested      
 pickets and I think they caused a lot 
 of trouble as well, because if the    
 pickets got out of hand and started to
 riot they came and hit them with      
 sticks and the situation became worse.
 Some of the men have been in jail for 
 the first time and now have a criminal
 record. Special feeding arrangements  
 were made for families of strikers.   </content>
