		<title>18STORY OF A DEMBLEBY FARM.</title>
		<content> The land just grew cadlocks and       
 poppies.This is the way that the first
 fields of a now prosperous farm were  
 described when a molecatcher used his 
 life savings to buy them in 1936.It   
 was a time of economic depression but 
 the 1939-1945 War together with hard  
 work enabled him to expand rapidly    
 buying in rough grazing and turning it
 into arable land.His sons worked the  
 land with the latest machinery but    
 little extra labour.They got maximum  
 yields by wise use of fertilisers and 
 removal of hedges.The farm might look 
 like a prairie except for the land    
 undulations and the large stands of   
 trees.Today only one of his sons is   
 left and he has no-one to succeed him 
 on the farm.                          
   Cadlocks = Sinapsis arvensis.
