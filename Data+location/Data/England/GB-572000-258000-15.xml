		<title>15The castle &amp; church, Lidgate</title>
		<content> The site on which the church stands   
 today was, in 55BC an earthwork .     
 Subsequently a flint castle was built,
 some of the remains of which are still
 visible today. Some cannon balls have 
 been found nearby which suggests that 
 a battle had been fought there. The   
 present church dates from the 13th    
 century and contains some fine        
 woodwork and a brass purporting to be 
 that of John de Lydgate a poet. The   
 rector, resident in the village, is   
 also rector of Cowlinge and Ousden.   
 Every year a flower festival is held  
 in the church and funds are raised to 
 help in the upkeep of the building.   
 These are executed by people from the 
 Lidgate and surrounding villages. A   
 choir has been formed by some of the  
 villagers to lead the singing in the  
 weekly service. The members of the    
 congregation help maintain the church.</content>
