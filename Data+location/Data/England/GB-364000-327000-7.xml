		<title>07EDUCATION AT STOKE ON TERN</title>
		<content>           {SCHOOL HISTORY             
    Stoke on Tern school was built in  
 1870 .  About one thousand children   
 have been through it.                 
    Much has happened during its       
 history.Most of the time it was in a  
 very bad condition.The toilets weren't
 properly built and the school depended
 on a water pump. The porches were used
 as air raid shelters during the       
 war.There was a well in the middle of 
 the playground, this hasn't been      
 examined for 40 years.                
 Most schools took in children from the
 age of 5 to 14 following the 1870     
 Education Act. Ours took children up  
 to this age.There was only 1 teacher  
 for all the children,about 60 to a    
 class.Stoke on Tern school became a   
 two teacher school in 1943 when there 
 were 51 children there to teach.In    
 1955 it became a three teacher school </content>
