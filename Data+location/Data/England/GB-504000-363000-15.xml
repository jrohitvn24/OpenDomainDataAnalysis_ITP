		<content> In Dunston there is a church,It is    
 called St Peter's.In 1873 it was burnt
 down.1 year later it was rebuilt.It   
 took 2 years to rebuild.Some of the   
 original materials were used.In the   
 fire a stained glass window was ruined
 and R H Carpenter had to raise a lot  
 of money  to have a new stained glass 
 window put in.                        
            In Dunston there is a very 
 old Methodist Chapel.I think the      
 chapel is soon going to be closed     
 because hardly anybody goes there and 
 the only people that do are very old. 
           In Nocton there is a        
 church.It has nice surroundings.It is 
 called All Saints.There is also a     
 church that is very spookey and dirty.
