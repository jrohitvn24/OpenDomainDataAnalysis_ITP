		<title>18Schools Co-operation</title>
		<content> Our school works with{four other      
{schools}in lessons, visits and        
 journeys. We have a{mini-bus}and all  
 fourth years{work together in one     
{school.}When they have had their turn 
 it works the same way for all years.  
 We also have an{extra teacher}who we  
 share. Just after Easter we did a     
{joint production}about children in the
 war. I think co-operation is a good   
 idea because if we didn't join up we  
 wouldn't be able to do joint          
 productions because there would be too
 many parts. In the lessons it is good 
 because you get to know what the other
 schools do and we have{different      
{teachers.}One teacher said that it was
 going very successfully because it    
 gave children a chance to meet more   
 children and it gave fourth years a   
 chance to meet the children they will 
 work with.Everybody liked co-operation</content>
