		<title>06QUARRYING</title>
		<content>   The last ICE AGE left deposits of   
 sand and gravel within the area, as   
 well as the more widespread clays.    
  Today quarrying occurs in GRID       
 squares  3875, 3874, 3873, 3773.      
{Steetley Quarries}are at present      
 extracting sand and gravel for the    
 local building industry.              
  The sand is worked, washed, sorted   
 and then sold using 15 operatives.    
  More recently the quarry has begun to
 mix and sell{Readymix Concrete,}buying
 in cement powder from elsewhere.      
  Large areas of former quarry workings
 have had the topsoil replaced and have
 been returned to agriculture. Still   
 more old workings have been bought by 
{WARNACT}to preserve them as wildlife  
 habitats.{Wetlands and woodlands}have 
 been preserved in this way.           
  The quarry owners and workers have   
 helped to reclaim and to preserve.    </content>
