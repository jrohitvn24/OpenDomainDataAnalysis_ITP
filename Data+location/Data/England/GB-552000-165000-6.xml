		<content>Our school is in Eynsford. It has a    
very big playing field, a cricket      
pitch, two rounders pitches and two    
climbing   frames. We are always free  
from litter  because we have a rule    
not to eat sweets. There are very good 
facilities for sport, maths, science   
and all our other lessons. We have a   
computer and calculators. All classes  
are carpeted to help keep us warm and  
comfortable and to keep the noise down 
The hall is used for assembly, school  
dinners,and gym in school time, and    
after school for clubs like brownies,  
guides, gym, weight watchers, and the  
Eynsford Band. For gym we have mats, a 
cage, a wooden horse, benches, a pair  
of rings which we all use. We have very
nice school dinners and extremely nice 
cooks.
