		<content> We went out to Farcet Fen.We took a   
 flower book with us,and a map.We went 
 down to the bridge by the old{River   
{Nene.}We found ragwort,elderflowers,  
 fleabane,dandelions and buttercups.A  
 lot of duckweed grew in the water.    
   We went to an old track across the  
 fen and these plants were growing;    
 hemlock,red clover,white clover,common
 red poppy,speedwell,cow parsley,      
 hogweed and stinging nettles.The hedge
 at the side of the track was of       
 hawthorn and ash with some silver     
 birch.Rosebay willow-herb grew in the 
 bottom of the hedge.There are         
 different grasses at the sides of the 
 fields.Some of them are ryegrass,wild 
 oats,cocksfoot and meadow barley.
