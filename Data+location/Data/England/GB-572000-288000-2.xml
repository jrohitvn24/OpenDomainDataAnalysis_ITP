		<content> Weeting Heath Nature Reserve was      
 bought from Mr. Parrot but given to   
 the Norfolk Naturalist Trust by Mr.   
 Christopher Cadbury in 1942. It       
 consists of 338 acres of sandy soil,  
 open grassland, heath. Earlier it had 
 been developed into an enclosed rabbit
 warren. It is famed for its birds,    
 including Stone Curlew &amp; Wheatear     
 which have nested there for over 60   
 yrs. Among the flora are the rare     
 Spiked Speedwell, Catchfly &amp;          
 Dianthus.Other great joys of the heath
 are butterflies &amp; grasshoppers.Lanes  
 or bridlepaths in the area are called 
 "Drifts".The hedgerows either side    
 boast many common wild flowers.One old
 footpath called the "Pad" exists      
 across a housing estate.Forestry      
 Commission woods are coniferous &amp; the 
 public can walk through them &amp; see    
 deer and other wild animals.          </content>
