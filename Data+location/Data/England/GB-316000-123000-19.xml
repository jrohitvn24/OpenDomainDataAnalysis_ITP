		<title>19Rumwell Community</title>
		<content>   Rumwell is a small community just   
 off the busy A38 road from Taunton to 
 Wellington.  It has a public house,   
 twenty-three houses and a population  
 of between seventy and one hundred.  A
 number of its inhabitants were        
 interviewed and the following comments
 were made:                            
  "We like living here, but it is not  
 easy to get about, we would like more 
 public transport."                    
  "It's a nice village but rather small
 and it's a pity there are no shops."  
  "It's very quiet here but sometimes  
 the local farmer puts on a barn dance"
  "The roads are pitch black at night, 
 we could do with some street lights." 
  "Sometimes the Morris Dancers come to
 dance outside the Rumwell Inn."       
  "I wish the local farmer would take  
 more care; his tractors spread muck   
 all over the road. It's dangerous."   </content>
