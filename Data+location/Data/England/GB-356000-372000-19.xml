		<content>  There are 2 small primary schools.   
 These are  Crowton School and Norley  
 School. Both of these are Church      
 schools. Norley is controlled by      
 Cheshire County Council while Crowton 
 is an aided school.                   
  Crowton School is built alongside the
 main B5153 Northwich to Frodsham road.
 It is modern in design and has 3      
 teaching areas and its own kitchen.   
 There is a football field  and        
 playground space which is marked out  
 for girls netball.                    
  When they leave Crowton School the   
 children then go to Weaverham High    
 School approximately 3 miles away.    
  Some of the children do not go to    
 either primary school, but are sent to
 private school.
