		<title>08THE WORTHING POOR HOUSE</title>
		<content> The building was built in 1618,it was 
 originally a workhouse where the men  
 came to bake bread and the go off to  
 work.There is a large fireplace in the
 main room which Mr.Stepney,the owner, 
 uncovered not long ago.               
 Some of the brickwork is Victorian but
 quite a bit is original.In the        
 living-room,the ceiling has been      
 uplifted.The floor is still original  
 but the stairs are Victorian.In the   
 kitchen,some beams have been replaced.
 Upstairs are only two rooms and the   
 floor is only 3.75cm thick.The roof   
 was originaly thatched,but now is     
 slate.                                
 The kitchen is quite small but Mr.    
 Stepney has modernized it.A door off  
 the kitchen leads into the bathroom.  
 The main bedroom has a blocked-off    
 fireplace.Its chimney joins the main  
 chimney.                              </content>
