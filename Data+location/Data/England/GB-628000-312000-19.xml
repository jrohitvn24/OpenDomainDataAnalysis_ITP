		<title>19Transport in mid-Norfolk</title>
		<content>                                       
 Like many areas of Norfolk,Salhouse   
 and its neighbouring villages suffer  
 from poor public transport facilities.
{Salhouse Station}is a victim of cuts  
 on the railways and,although one or   
 two pay trains stop during the day,on 
 their way from Norwich to Cromer on   
 the coast,the station buildings are   
 falling into decay.                   
 Bus services appear to be even more   
 infrequent,with local people who were 
 interviewed,complaining that there    
 are just 2 buses a day into and out of
 Norwich.There are also only 2 bus     
 stops in Salhouse.With local people so
 dependent upon Norwich and its        
 outskirts for many facilities,the car 
 is a necessity rather than a luxury.  
 Small wonder that Norfolk has one of  
 the highest car owner per head of     
 population figures in Gt.Britain.     </content>
