		<title>15Landscape around Chillington</title>
		<content> I think that our landscape should     
 carry on in the future and not be a   
 litter bin because it is an area for  
 nature to live in. The landscape has  
 got rounded hills and soft rock       
 (slate or shale). If you dug a hole   
 you would first come to soil. The     
 first soil you would come to would be 
 red soil. It is red soil because of   
 the iron in it.  The most popular land
 cover is grass because it is easy to  
 grow. I think the landscape is pretty.
{The journey from Chillington to       
{Stokenham School.                     
 I walk out of my back door and go down
 the road.  We go past the butcher's on
 the right hand side and the           
 hairdresser, then the garage. Further 
 up there's a telephone box. After the 
 'phone you go to Stokenham until you  
 get to Carehouse Cross where you turn 
 left to the school.                   </content>
