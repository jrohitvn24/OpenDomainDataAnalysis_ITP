 MOST OF THE FARMLAND IS               
 CONCENTRATED                          
 IN THE TOP THIRD AND FORMS THE EDGE OF
 A MUCH DENSER DISTRIBUTION OF FARMS   
 BEYOND. DIVIDING THE FARMS ARE        
 SCATTERED WOODLANDS OF MOSTLY         
 CONIFEROUS TREES,COVERING ABOUT ONE   
 SIXTH OF THE TOTAL BLOCK.THERE ARE NO 
 FEWER THAN EIGHT FARMS. ONE IS WELL - 
 KNOWN FOR IT'S TROUT;ANOTHER OPENLY   
 ADVERTISES IT'S MARKET GARDEN PRODUCE 
 TO  PASSERS-BY. ONE CAN PURCHASE      
 ANYTHING FROM POULTRY TO TOMATOES,AND 
 MOST OF THE MARKET GARDEN FARMS CAN   
 SELL THEIR GOODS ON SITE. SINCE THE   
 TREND TO BUY MORE HOME GROWN FOOD     
 DEVELOPED,LOCAL DEMAND IS SUFFICIENT  
 TO PREVENT THE FARMER FROM SENDING THE
 PRODUCE TO MARKET. ONE DISTINCT FARM  
 IS RENOWNED FOR ITS HORSE SLAUGHTERING
 THE END PRODUCT IS DOG FOOD.          </content>
