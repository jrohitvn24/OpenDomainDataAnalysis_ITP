		<content> AT PATTERDALE SCHOOL WE DO A LOT OF   
 SPORT WE PLAY ROUNDERS AND SKITTLE    
 BALL. AT PATTERDALE PLAYING FIELD     
 PEOPLE COME TO SPORTS AT THE END OF   
 JUNE. ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR SPORTS  
 IN OUR AREA IS FELL RUNNING . SOME    
 NIGHTS THE BOYS GO TO CRICKET         
 PRACTICE.  AT SCHOOL THE CHILDREN     
 LIKE DOING GYM . ANOTHER POPULAR      
 ASPECT OF RECREATION  IS HOUND        
 TRAILING.  THIS HAS A STRONG LOCAL    
 TRADITION DATING BACK MANY YEARS. THE 
 AREA IS VERY GOOD FOR ROCK CLIMBING   
 BECAUSE THE MOUNTAINS HAVE MANY       
 STEEP CLIFF FACES AND ROCK OUTCROPS.  
 MANY PEOPLE COME TO THE GLENRIDDING   
 AREA TO TAKE UP FELL WALKING AS THE   
 HELVELLYN RANGE OF MOUNTAINS ARE LESS 
 THAN 2 TO 3 MILES AWAY.
