		<content> If you walk up Lilleshall Hill you can
 see most of our area. To the north a  
 patchwork of fields; to the east the  
 village of Church Aston and Newport;  
 to the south Lilleshall Village tucked
 under the hill and beyond it farmland 
 again. To the west is Telford outside 
 our boundary. The monument on the hill
 is a Shropshire landmark. It was      
 erected in 1833 in memory of the 1st. 
 Duke of Sutherland who owned most of  
 this area and beyond until 1917. The  
 Duke's cottages are a feature of this 
 area, many having been renovated and  
 extended. You may still trace some of 
 the limestone quarries and canals     
 built here over 200 years ago. The    
 railway too has gone, now being       
 replaced by a new road. Today most of 
 the area is covered in rich, deep,    
 green corn waiting to be harvested    
 after we have finished our survey.    </content>
