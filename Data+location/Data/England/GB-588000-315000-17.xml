		<title>17 SOCIAL CONCERN OF LITCHAM</title>
		<content>   The most common comment was that    
Litcham is quiet and peaceful.This is  
so because the area is a village and   
has few amenities.The elder generation 
find it quiet and the perfect situation
to live in,the younger people also find
it quiet but a bit boring.Most of the  
children would like regular clubs to   
start.                                 
   The main concern was the lack of    
amenities.Road networks and transport  
systems were also complained about.The 
network is adequete but there is a     
demand for more A roads.Also bus routes
are complained about.There is'nt a bus 
every day and alot of people would find
this very helpful.
