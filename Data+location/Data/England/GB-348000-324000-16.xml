		<title>16Copper Mines at Clive</title>
		<content>{The Copper Mine}at Clive is situated  
 at{Mine Bank},down the lane from the  
 Church and is marked by a small       
 building alongside the road and a row 
 of mineworkers cottages.  The Mine is 
 not now worked, but at least three    
 shafts and a total of one mile of     
 underground workings still remain.    
 Copper was mined from the early 17th  
 century but was most important in the 
{mid-19th century}when ore was drawn   
 off to lower levels and then raised to
 the surface in skips by means of the  
 winding shaft.  The copper carbonate  
 ore was leached with Hydrochloric Acid
 and then the copper was precipitated  
 from solution using tanks of scrap    
 iron.
