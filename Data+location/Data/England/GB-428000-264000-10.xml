		<title>10River Leam, Leamington Spa.</title>
		<content> The{River Leam}is approximatley       
 30km long. It flows in an easterly    
 direction, it starts at the village   
 of Woolscott and ends in{Leamington   
{Spa}when it runs into the {River Avon.
 On a study of the {River Leam }we     
 tested the p.h. value of the water    
 opposite {Victoria park }in {         
{Leamington Spa}. The p.h. value of the
 water is 7 which means that the water 
 is neutral.We made a net using  a     
 piece of cloth,wire and a stick.We    
 took a few sweeps and we caught a     
{Sludgeworm}which suggested that the   
 water was polluted, but then we found 
 a{Mayfly Nymph }which meant that the  
 water is clean. We decided with the   
 p.h. value and the {Mayfly Nymph}that 
 the water in the {River Leam} is      
 unpolluted.
