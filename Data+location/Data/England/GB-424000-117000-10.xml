		<title>10A DAY IN MY LIFE OF A BOY</title>
		<content> I woke up on a bed with a mattress and
 a blanket with sheets.I wore          
 underwear,a jumper,trousers,trainers, 
 and socks.I had breakfast which was,  
 tea from a teabag,Weetabix from wheat 
 and toast with jam on.We then drove to
 school and I read a computer manual.We
 sang songs at 9:45 till 10:15 they    
 were good.We then did some English.The
 other children went out to play but I 
 watched someone playing"DARE DEVIL    
 DENNIS", on the computer.After play we
 started Mental Arithmetic,and after it
 was Leon's talk.After lunch,I played  
 with the Infants.At 13:15 we did some 
 Scope which is an English book.At     
 14:15 Mr.Powell talked about two      
 musuems.This lasted till the end of   
 school.Straight afterwards we played  
 our cornets.A cornet is a thing which 
 you blow down to make a noise,Oliver  
 was playing"FROGGER",on the computer. </content>
