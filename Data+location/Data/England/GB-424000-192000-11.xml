		<content> The early 13th century medieval       
 monastic Tithe Barn(length 152feet,   
 width 44feet,height 48feet)originally 
 belonged to Beaulieu Abbey.Constructed
 with stone walls &amp; stone tiled roof,it
 stands at the bottom of the Holloway. 
 There are east and west doors,the     
 larger north and south doors were     
 added in the 18th century.The building
 now belongs to the National Trust and 
 is used for storage of farm machinery 
 and fodder.A lunch was held in the    
 Barn in 1977 for Queen Elizabeth II's 
 Silver Jubilee.                       
 The adjacent courthouse is possibly   
 the oldest house in the village with a
 south wall contemporary with the Barn 
 and a 16th century window in the      
 kitchen.Danes House is about the 2nd  
 oldest &amp; is believed to have been     
 built about 1680.
