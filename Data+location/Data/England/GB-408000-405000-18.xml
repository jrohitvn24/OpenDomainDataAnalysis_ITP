		<content>{The Peak District National Park.}     
  The village of Holme lies on the     
 northern borders of the Peak District 
 National Park in one of the least     
 known parts called the 'Dark Peak'. It
 is made up mostly of steep sided      
 valleys and rough moorland. It is     
 particularly convenient for the towns 
 of Lancashire where work was mainly   
 for the Pottery Industry and West     
 Yorkshire where the woollen textile   
 towns grew up. The entrance to the    
 Peak District National Park which is  
 in our area is clearly recognisable by
 the huge mill wheel of Millstone Grit 
 set in local sandstone.               
{The Pennine Way.}                     
  The Pennine way passes near Holme and
 it is 250 miles long. The Pennine Way 
 runs from Edale in the south to       
 Roxbugshire on the Scottish border. It
 was completed in April 1965.          </content>
