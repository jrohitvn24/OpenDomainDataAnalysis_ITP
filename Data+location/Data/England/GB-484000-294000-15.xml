		<title>15Birdwatching on the Eyebrook</title>
		<content> Many ornithologists visit the Eyebrook
 armed with binoculars,telescopes and  
 cameras observing the many flocks,    
 always hoping to see a rarity.Views   
 from the road are good and uninterr-  
 upted.The walk through the plantation 
 on the eastern side is often less     
 rewarding as far as gulls and water   
 fowl are concerned,but it is very plea
 sant with lovely views of the lake.   
 Tiny goldcrests call from the tops of 
 the firs,Swans may be seen gliding    
 majestically,or even a solitary heron,
 still and statuesque standing in the  
 shallows.In summer swifts and swallows
 swoop low over the lake to catch      
 insects.Yellow wagtails flit along the
 hedgerowa and amongst the grazing     
 cattle.The autumn migration sees many 
 visitors,teal,wigeon,gadwall,shorelles
 and greylag geese. Rarities include   
 snowgeese,Bewick swans and cormorant. </content>
