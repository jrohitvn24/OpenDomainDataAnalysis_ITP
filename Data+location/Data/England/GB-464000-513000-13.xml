		<title>13HOUSING IN THE VILLAGES</title>
		<content> AT CHARLTON AND MARGROVE PARK THE     
 TERRACED COTTAGES WHICH WERE          
 ORIGINALLY BUILT FOR MINE WORKERS ARE 
 BRICK BUILT, MANY ARE CEMENT-RENDERED 
 AND COLOURED IN VARIOUS SHADES. DOORS 
 AND WINDOWS HAVE BEEN REPLACED SO THAT
 EACH HOUSE HAS ITS OWN INDIVIDUALITY  
 AND MOST HAVE BEEN MODERNIZED AND     
 CONTAIN AMENITIES SUCH AS BATHS,      
 INSIDE LAVATORIES AND RUNNING WATER   
 WHICH WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN PROVIDED    
 ORIGINALLY. MOST OF THE HOUSES ARE    
 OWNER OCCUPIED, THOUGH SOME AT        
 MARGROVE PARK STILL BELONG TO A LOCAL 
 LAND OWNER, AND SOME AT CHARLTONS     
 BELONG TO THE COUNCIL. ONLY ONE HOUSE 
 REMAINS AT MARGROVE PARK WITH THE     
 ORIGINAL STYLE OF WINDOWS AND DOOR AND
 HAS NOT BEEN CEMENT RENDERED. ALTHOUGH
 QUITE SMALL, MANYUU OF THESE HOUSES   
 HAVE BEEN MODERNIZED TO A HIGH        
 STANDARD.                             </content>
