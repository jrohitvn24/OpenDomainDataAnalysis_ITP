		<title>01Lizard Peninsula</title>
		<content> Our survey area is on the Lizard      
 Peninsula. It covers parts of the     
 parishes of Mullion,Grade Ruan and    
 Landewednack.It is mostly grassland,  
 heathland and farmland and has a small
 population.The area is rich in plants 
 and flowers.The climate is warm,wet   
 and windy. Most of the area is on     
 serpentine rock and is flat and       
 treeless.There are some sheltered     
 areas such as the valley at St.Ruan.  
 There is an airfield on Predannack    
 Downs and an old windmill.There is an 
 old manor house at Erisey and a ruined
 church at Ruan Major.The area is near 
 a number of beaches and coves and     
 attracts many holidaymakers.There are 
 no villages in the block except for   
 Ruan Minor which covers part of the SE
 corner and it is here that most of the
 population lives.
