		<title>11  WILLIAM LEECH-BUILDER</title>
		<content>  {William Leech}was born in{Newcastle-
{Upon-Tyne}and was educated at Westgate
 Road Council School.At 21, his        
 ambition was to own a Rolls Royce, a  
 country estate and a charitable       
 trust.His first occupation was        
 engineering but he changed to         
 building instead because of his theory
 that other builders used inefficient  
 methods.                              
   He came to Morpeth in 1934, building
 on over 300 acres of land here and    
 7000 acres throughout Britain.He built
 houses for 44 years and retired in    
 1976 to become President of{Leech     
{Homes.}                               
   Over the years, houses have altered 
 in design.Mr. Leech's houses had      
 outside W.C.'s and coalhouses !Mr.    
 Leech predicts that solar heating,    
 leisure and exercise rooms will       
 transform future homes.               </content>
