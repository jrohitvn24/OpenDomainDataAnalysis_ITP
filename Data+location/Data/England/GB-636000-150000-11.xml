		<title>11An Interesting Person</title>
		<content> My Grandfather is a very interesting  
 person. Nearly every day he cleans his
{World War II}souvenirs which include  
 an air-raid warden's helmet and a box 
 of bullets- mostly rifle bullets.     
 There are many{army veterans}in my    
 family. My Uncle was a sergeant and   
 had his elbow down to his fingers     
 blown off by shrapnel. My Grandfather 
 often goes along Folkestone Cliffs    
 admiring the{Customs Offices}where he 
 used to work. He always enjoys        
 gardening. My Grandfather has been{a  
{great influence}in my life and helped 
 me when I could not manage and pushed 
 me when I could go no further. He     
 always enjoys country walks. He is    
 very restless. After he has finished  
 one job he has to find another job to 
 occupy him. I am glad I have a        
 Grandfather like this.
