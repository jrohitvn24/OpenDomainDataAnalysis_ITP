		<title>01GENERAL REVIEW, HARROW.</title>
		<content>  Our D-block reflects the essential   
 nature of a suburban London commuter  
 belt. Much of the area is a mixture of
 housing and open spaces.  Public      
 amenities reflect the needs of the    
 local population. There are plenty of 
 restaurants, supermarkets and         
 transport outlets to London. Leisure  
 needs are catered for by parks, sports
 grounds and a Leisure Centre. There is
 also a popular Arts Centre as well as 
 several libraries. Industry is not a  
 prominent feature of this block,      
 although Kodak and warehousing        
 generate local employment. Religious  
 needs are catered for by most         
 denominations. Education services     
 provide for the needs of all age      
 groups. Our D-block also contains the 
 administrative nerve-centre of Harrow,
 along with a well-stocked reference   
 library.                              </content>
