		<content> This is a popular holiday area with   
 many holiday cottages. Some of these  
 are owned by local residents and some 
 by non-locals. Permanent residents are
 both owner occupiers and tenants.     
 There is a council estate consisting  
 of 27 houses and bungalows, and one is
 owner occupied. Architecturally       
 Hawkshead is an interesting area, 'a  
 little town that never grew'. One     
 small town house with its own         
 distinctive style is Thimble Hall -   
 timber framed upstairs and jettied    
 outside. An unusual feature found in  
 some of these houses is the use of    
 Brathay slabs which are unique to the 
 Hawkshead area. They are used slightly
 interlocking horizontally and         
 vertically. The walls in the          
 Information Centre are built with     
 these slabs, which were also used as  
 dividing walls in fields.             </content>
