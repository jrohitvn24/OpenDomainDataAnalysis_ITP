		<content> The manor was given by the 2nd Earl of
 Lancaster to his favourite,Robert     
 Holland who later betrayed his        
 patron. After the battle of Burton    
 Bridge in 1322 the "Friends of the    
 Earl of Lancaster" razed the manor    
 house to the ground.The manor then    
 passed through the hands of the Lovell
 family,King Henry V11 and the         
 Fitzwilliam family.In 1539 it went to 
 the Hollys, then to the Pagets, then  
 the Stoneleigh family held it until   
 1923 when the manorial system was     
 wound up.Opposite The Moat is The     
 Court House dating from 16th C and    
 probably the gate house to the manor  
 of that time. According to tradition  
 it was the venue of the manor court.  
 Cornmill House next door to The Moat  
 was built early 19th C.The watermill  
 has been demolished.The bridge over   
 the Swarbourn was built in 1813.      </content>
