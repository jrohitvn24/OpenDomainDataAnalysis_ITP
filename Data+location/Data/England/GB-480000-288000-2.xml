		<title>02THE HALL EAST CARLTON</title>
		<content>This fine building was erected in 1868 
by Sir Geoffrey Palmer on the site of  
an old farmhouse.                      
There are eight ground floor rooms.The 
galleried hall has a large staircase   
leading to thirty bedrooms.            
Outside is a stable block, an ice      
house(cylindrical and lined with brick)
and the Coach House now converted to a 
museum.                                
In the 1930's the British Steel        
Corporation (then Stewart and Lloyds)  
bought the hall for executives who had 
moved to work in Corby. At this time a 
number of air raid shelters were dug   
into the ground around the house.      
B.S.C. then sold the estate to Corby   
Council which kept visiting students   
there. Now a private enterprise has    
renovated it for use as an hotel or    
restaurant.
