		<title>07Transport In Norton Area.</title>
		<content>   There are quite a few minor roads in
 our area, but most of the land is     
 fields.  The most important road      
 junction is at the roundabout near    
 Sutton Maddock Garage.  Here the      
 B4379, B4176 and A442 roads meet.     
 They lead to Shifnal, Dudley,         
 Bridgnorth and Telford( and the       
 motorway).  The A442 is the busiest   
 road, running from north to south, and
 connecting Whitchurch to              
 Kidderminster.                        
   Different means of transport on the 
 roads are cars, vans, lorries, motor  
 cycles, bicycles,coaches,             
 buses,Landrovers, tractors,fire       
 engines, ambulances,police cars and   
 jeeps.                                
   At Norton there is a Crossing Patrol
 Warden and flashing crossing lights   
 for school children to cross the A442 
 at lunch time.                        </content>
