		<title>15Living in Swallownest</title>
		<content> I think Swallownest is a nice area to 
 live in because you have the local    
 shops and bank just down the road.  I 
 prefer little shops  because they are 
 more personal, although things there  
 are dearer than in supermarkets.  In  
 the village centre there are also two 
 nurseries and a hairdresser.  We have 
 a local swimming pool and a park.     
 Swallownest is more attractive in some
 parts than others.  We have fields    
 round the village but behind them are 
 Orgreave and Brookhouse pits and the  
 sewage works.  There is rather a lot  
 of litter and some vandalism in the   
 village.  Being a mining village it   
 can be smoky and dusty.  There are    
 ponds and lakes for fishing and walks 
 you can enjoy. There is a good bus    
 service from Swallownest to Rotherham 
 or Sheffield. Each year the Annual    
 Aston Gala is held in Swallownest.    </content>
