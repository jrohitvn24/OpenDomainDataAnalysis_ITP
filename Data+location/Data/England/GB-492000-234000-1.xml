		<content> I9UN  This area is of a rural nature, 
 taking in two villages,{Aspley Guise  
 and{Husborne Crawley.}It is on the    
 outskirts of the new city of Milton   
 Keynes and lies between the           
 boundaries of Woburn Safari Park      
 to the South and the M1 Motorway.     
 The branch line railway between       
 Bletchley and Bedford runs along the  
 top of the grid squares.              
                                       
   The main topographical features are 
 mixed woodlands and open fields,      
 traversed by a rich network of        
 footpaths. The soil is light and sandy
 and Bentonite(Fullers Earth) is       
 extracted within the area. The        
 reclamation of these mining works has 
 led to an intensive programme of tree 
 planting.
