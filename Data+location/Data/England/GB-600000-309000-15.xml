		<content> The dominance of arable farming on the
 landscape has tended to concentrate   
 the 'natural' flora and fauna into the
 few small woods remaining and into    
 gardens. A number of small ponds and  
 wet meadows are rich in plant, insect 
 and bird life but could not be classed
 as major wildlife habitats. Moles,    
 Rats, and Rabbits are common. Foxes   
 are seen occasionally. Bats are to be 
 seen and have been recorded roosting  
 in the church, in other buildings and 
 in trees. Common bird species of the  
 fields and hedgerows are Red-legged   
 Partridge, Woodpigeon, Yellowhammer &amp; 
 Kestrel. Pheasants are common.        
 Woodland species are less common, but 
 Jay, Nuthatch and Lesser Spotted      
 Woodpecker can be seen. In winter     
 large numbers of Lapwing, Golden      
 Plover, gulls and Starlings come to   
 feed on the fields.                   </content>
