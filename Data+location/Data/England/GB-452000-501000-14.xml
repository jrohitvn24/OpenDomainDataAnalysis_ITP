		<title>14SHOOTING SYNDICATES</title>
		<content> A diagonal line between squares 4 and 
 9 roughly divides the area betwed two 
 shooting syndicates. Hundreds(no-one  
 is willing to disclose exactly how    
 many) of pheasants are reared in      
 Raisdale to the South and are turned  
 off at six weeks old onto the whole   
 area. The shares in the shoots are    
 called guns and each man or gun pays  
 his share for a keeper and the costs  
 of birds and beaters. Beaters are     
 employed locally on shooting days.    
 Their job is to send the birds into   
 the air. The owner of the southerly   
 area employs a full time keeper and   
 farms the land. The owner of the land 
 to the North owns a gun shop in       
 Stokesley - the nearest market town.  
 He has had two ponds dug on his land  
 and has encouraged mallard ducks and  
 other water fowl to inhabit them, in  
 the hope of further sport.            </content>
