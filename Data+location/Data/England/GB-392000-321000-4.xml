		<title>04STAFFS POLICE DOG TRAINING</title>
		<content>   The Staffordshire Police Force      
brought in dogs in about 1950.     They
advertised for either breeding dogs or 
puppies.    They use some Labradors but
they mostly use Alsatians, because they
are obedient and adapt well from being 
a pet at home to being a police dog.   
They mainly use the dogs for tracking  
and attacking.                         
   The dogs have special trainers      
called  Â£Handlers'.    The handlers    
keep the dogs at home.     They put    
the dogs through the necessary         
training of how to obey.   They teach  
them to sniff out explosives, drugs,   
corpses and criminals.                 
   On OPEN DAYS the dogs usually go    
over ramps , through circles , over    
hurdles and through a fire hoop.       
Also there is a show of obedience.     
When the dog gets too old to work      
then his handler can keep him.         </content>
