		<title>15BY BUS TO SCHOOL AT WELLS</title>
		<content>                                       
   I wake up at 7.30 and after getting 
washed and dressed I go out of the     
front door and walk to the bus stop.   
   The bus arrives at the stop at      
about 8.25.  The older children sit    
nearer the back of the bus as this is  
thought of as a privilege.  We arrive  
at our school at about 8.45 and the    
bell goes, signalling us to enter the  
school, at 8.50.                       
   After morning registration we go to 
lessons.  Registration is to find which
children are in school, so that they   
can be accounted for in case of a fire 
or other disaster.                     
   At school we have eight 40 or 35    
minute lessons every day. There is a   
break in the morning of 15 minutes and 
a 1 hour 5 minute break for dinner.
