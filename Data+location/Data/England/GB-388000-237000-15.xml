		<title>15Changes in Upper Strensham</title>
		<content> Certain buildings and land are on the 
 brink of change in 1985. The public   
 house, which has been closed for      
 several years, has a new owner, who   
 has been granted a licence. It is due 
 to open during August as a public     
 house and resturant. The Village Hall,
 an ex-army hut from the Great War     
 needs rebuilding. Applications have   
 been made for grants, and a 100 club  
 has been started to fund the          
 alterations and provide sanitation.   
   The C18 alms houses are roofless and
 derelict. Grants have now been        
 promised to the trustees, who are     
 responsible to the charity commission.
 Tenders are now out for the conversion
 of this listed building into 3 modern 
 almshouses. There are also tentative  
 plans for further housing development 
 on the unused land which was once the 
 site of Strensham Court.              </content>
