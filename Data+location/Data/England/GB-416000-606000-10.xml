		<content>{David}There are four people in my     
 family.My Mam,my Dad,my brother and   
 me.We have a dog called Teal.It is    
 labrador.It will be two in November.  
 My Mam's hobby is knitting.She has    
 knitted two jumpers.My Mam works at   
 the pit canteen.I think she likes     
 it there.When the car is broken my Dad
 fixes it.When my Mam goes to work in  
 the morning my Dad says,"I am always  
 left with all the work,aren't I       
 David? and I say,"Well that is too    
 bad, isn't it."                       
 Sometimes he says,"Soon I will have   
 to go to work."                       
 When the cartoons are on in the       
 afternoon my Dad says,"These          
 programmes are for babies." I say,    
 "Well I just like them," and Paul my  
 brother says the same as me.
