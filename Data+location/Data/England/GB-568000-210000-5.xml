		<content>   The majority of the land in our area
 is farmland. Much of the farmland is  
 devoted to crops such as{Wheat,       
{Barley, Corn and Oil seed rape.}A     
 particular farm had three workers to  
 manage eight hundred and forty five   
 acres.                                
{ Oil seed rape}is sprayed towards the 
 end of July and is harvested at the   
 end of September.{Wheat and Barley}are
 harvested between the end of September
 and October, no later. The average    
 field is about twenty acres. A{Spray, 
{Combine Harvester, Mineral Spreader,  
{Drill}and{Plough}are some of the items
 a farmer uses.                        
  One of the main problems is the      
{Pollen Beetle}which diseases the oil  
 seed rape. If the plant has more than 
 fifteen beetles on it then the farmer 
 sprays it with an insecticide.
