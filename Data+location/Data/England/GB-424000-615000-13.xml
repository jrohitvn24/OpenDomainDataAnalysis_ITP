		<title>13TRANSPORT</title>
		<content>    The main means of transport in this
 area is that of the car.Most families 
 own a car.                            
           Alnmouth Railway Station is 
 only about ten minutes ride by car,   
 although there is no direct bus       
 service.Trains are available south to 
 London or north to Edinburgh or       
 Aberdeen.A commuter-service with      
 Newcastle is maintained at peak       
 periods during the day.               
           A regular bus service runs  
 down the coast through Howick and     
 Longhoughton to Alnwick,which is      
 extended as far as Newcastle in the   
 summer.Due to recent cut-backs in     
 rural areas,the service is not as     
 frequent as residents might like.
