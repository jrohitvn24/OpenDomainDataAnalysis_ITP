{Saltholme Farm }was first rented by   
{I.C.I.}from the church commision in   
 1936 and later bought outright in     
 1957.It was what lay under the ground,
 namely{anhydrite}which was I.C.I's    
 main interest.These mine workings are 
 no longer in use but have resulted in 
 some subsidence which has caused the  
 formation of some small lakes and     
 pools.Two of these are in the care of 
 the{Wild Life Trust}as they provide a 
 sanctuary for many migrant birds      
 particularly during the winter months.
  The farm covers about 5000 acres and 
 supports 430 suckling cows of the     
 French{Charolais}breed,and  1400      
 sheep.
