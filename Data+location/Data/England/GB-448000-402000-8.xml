    Although many of the farms have now
 disappeared, farms and farming still  
 thrives. Most of the land around      
 Barnburgh and Harlington is arable    
 land, and the greater part is used for
 growing cereals, barley, wheat and    
 oil-seed rape. Some potatoes are      
 grown,and a few of the local farmers  
 rent out their land for the growing of
 peas. A small acreage is devoted to   
 growing strawberries and so attracts  
 visitors to our area. The land is fine
 agricultural land, and all the farmers
 have good, modern machinery. Two of   
 the farms support a dairy herd and Mr 
 Richardson of Dovecote Farm supplies  
 the villages daily, as well as        
 transporting quite a large amount of  
 milk to the Wickersley Dairy.
