  The New Bield in Lyveden is a ruin   
 of a house built in 1594, protected by
 the National Trust.Lyveden is the same
 as other places in England (Trees and 
 Fields etc.) A difference between the 
 Spanish countryside and the English   
 countryside is that the English       
 countryside is more well kept than the
 Spanish countryside.The National Trust
 is responsible for the upkeep of      
 certain historical features.          
 They have not got one of those in     
 Spain, but I think it would be a good 
 idea to have one so that in the future
 we can study interesting aspects of   
 our past.

 Prince William School, Oundle at the  
 time of the survey in July 1985.      </content>
