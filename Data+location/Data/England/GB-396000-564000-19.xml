		<title>19FARMING IN CORBRIDGE AREA</title>
		<content>   Farming in the Corbridge area is    
 mixed,being cereal growing,cattle and 
 sheep breeding.Wheat,barley and oats  
 have been grown for many years but    
 recent years has seen the introduction
 of oil seed rape,triticale,lupins and 
 peas.The breeds of cattle have also   
 changed enormously and the dairy herds
 now contain Shorthorns,Friesians and  
 Holsteins.The beef herds also can     
 muster several continental breeds such
 as Charolais and Limousin.The reason  
 for the change is an attempt to reduce
 costs.After an absence of some 20     
 years the local agricultural show has 
 been reintroduced.It is now called the
 Nothumberland County Show and is an   
 important date in the calendar of the 
 farming community.
