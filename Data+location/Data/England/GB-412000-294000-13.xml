		<title>13POLICE AND FIRE SUTTON C'FLD</title>
		<content>   The{Police and Fire Stations}stand  
 side by side on the Lichfield Road.   
   The{Police}Station was built in 1960
 and contains an enquiry desk,interview
 and charge rooms for the public and   
 social and locker rooms for Police.The
 team of 83 uniformed and 15 C.I.D.    
 officers is led by a superintendent.  
   Next door is the{Fire}Station,built 
 three years later.There are 28 firemen
 who work on one of four daily shifts. 
 Only one fire engine is based there.  
   On average they have two{emergency }
 calls a day but they have never had a 
 single day without some kind of       
 incident.They rescue pets from danger 
 as well as people from fires.         
   The worst fire dealt with was when a
 Nursing Home burnt down.A fireman was 
{killed}on duty in 1982.Unfortunately  
 they get a lot of{hoax}calls.
