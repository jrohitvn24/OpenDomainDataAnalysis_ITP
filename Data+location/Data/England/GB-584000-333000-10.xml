		<title>10SOUTH CREAKE, NORTH NORFOLK</title>
		<content> South Creake is a village in the      
 valley of the River Burn, in N        
 Norfolk, low rainfall, on well drained
 chalk.  Its situation, six miles from 
 the market town of Fakenham, has      
 caused closure of shops, except the   
 post office and butchers.             
 It has a recreation ground, no village
 hall.  Part of a former brewery, used 
 as a social club, has a small room for
 use of local organisations.           
 There is no employment, other than    
 agricultural, so the village has      
 become a dormitory for people working 
 in Norwich, Fakenham or Kings Lynn.   
 Many inhabitants are elderly.         
 The present imbalance between the     
 residents who provide the permanency, 
 and the floating population who       
 enliven, would increase, if the       
 village junior school were to be      
 closed.                               </content>
