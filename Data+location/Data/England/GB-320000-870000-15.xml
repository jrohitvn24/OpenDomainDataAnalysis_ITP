		<title>15A MORNING IN JAMES'LIFE.</title>
		<content> I awake at 7.30a.m.and have a shower.I
 proceed to dress in grey school       
 trousers,a white shirt with long      
 sleeves,a grey school jumper,a school 
 tie which is gold with red and black  
 diagonal stripes and my black school  
 shoes.I brush my teeth and "blow-dry" 
 my hair.I make breakfast which        
 consists of a bowl of cereal and a cup
 of tea.At 8.30 a.m.I walk to school   
 with my sister.The school bell rings  
 at 8.55 a.m.I begin work immediately  
 on Language,Mathematics etc.The       
 playtime bell rings at 10.35 a.m.The  
 boys in my class play football in the 
 playing field.I then carry on with a  
 different type of work until the lunch
 hour begins at 12.15 p.m.I usually    
 have lunch in the canteen,choosing    
 fish and chips followed by bread and  
 butter pudding and custard!
