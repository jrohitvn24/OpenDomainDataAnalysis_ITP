 St.John's Bakery. I am the daughter of
 Mr.St.John who owns the bakery. We own
 four shops. One in                    
 Warsash,Stubbington,Woolworths in     
 Fareham and Titchfield where the      
 bakery is.We have over 12 people      
 working in the bakery and over 15     
 working in the four shops. Downstairs 
 in the bakery there are 2 ovens which 
 are fixed onto the wall,4 mixers,10   
 large tables,1 cutter,2 machines which
 roll the pastry into balls. Downstairs
 they make the bread,rolls,saviouries  
 and cook some cakes. Upstairs they    
 make the cake filling in the cakes. My
 dad makes the birthday cakes and      
 wedding cakes,he also works a lot     
 making bread. My dad gets up at 4.00  
 am each day and works to 12.00. Then  
 he goes to bed for most of the day.
