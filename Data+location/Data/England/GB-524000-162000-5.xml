		<title>05HISTORIC HOUSE,CARSHALTON.</title>
		<content> Now St. Philomena's School, this fine 
 example of classical architecture     
 dates from l7l5 when Sir John Fellowes
 bought the estate.  The house has all 
 the external features of the classical
 style in England, large sashed windows
 symmetrically arranged,a flat roof, a 
 cornice and entrance doors complete   
 with pediments, porticoes and steps.  
 The interior has been converted to    
 accommodate class rooms, music        
 department and sixth form library and 
 common rooms. However, a number of    
 interesting features remain from the  
 original interior and include a fine  
 staircase, panelled library, a painted
 room, an oak panelled reception room  
 and a blue parlour beautifully        
 restored in the Adam style. Visits are
 made only by appointment in the school
 holidays by arrangement with the      
 Sister Superior.                      </content>
