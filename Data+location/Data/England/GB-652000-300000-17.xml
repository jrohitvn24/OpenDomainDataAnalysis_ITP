		<content> This is called the Parish church of   
 St. Margaret &amp; church the vicars name 
 is Christopher R. Chapman.            
   This church was rebuilt after the   
 old one was burnt in 1856. When the   
 thatched roof caught fire in a storm. 
   The new roof is made out of slates. 
 There is a tower, it is tall, but it  
 has no bells, as they corode with the 
 sea soil. Also the tower is not strong
 enough to support them.               
   The service times are:-             
 8.30  every Sunday = Holy Communion   
 11.00am each Sunday as follows: 1st,  
 3rd &amp; 5th. Sung parish communion 2nd  
 Sunday in month. There is poor        
 attendance at the services. The church
 is small but is very pleasant to      
 visit.
