		<content>    The Government Sponsored Youth     
Training Scheme helps young school     
leavers to gain work experience. We    
interviewed one YTS supervisor who had 
a group of six boys on a Forestry      
Course.                                
    Their day starts at 8.00am with the
job of watering the tree seedlings in  
the polythene tunnel. Then they load   
the  tools onto the pick-up and drive  
to the work site. When using tools,    
boots with steel toecaps are worn.     
    The main job in summer is weeding  
between the rows of sapplings in the   
nursery where there are many types of  
broadleaved trees. This can be boring  
but the beauty of the countryside makes
up for it. They see all kinds of       
wildlife and we were lucky enough to   
see two deer.                          
    If a worker is bitten by an adder, 
hospital treatment is needed.          </content>
