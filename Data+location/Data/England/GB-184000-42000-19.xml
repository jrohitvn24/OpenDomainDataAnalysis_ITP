		<content> Our survey area is composed very      
 largely of farmland with the River Fal
 twisting its way through it.The area  
 is quite well wooded.The farms are    
 mixed with cattle and agriculture.Corn
 and Barley are grown and so are soft  
 fruits like strawberries at           
 Fentongollan Farm.The area is very    
 thinly populated with the exception of
 Malpas which is a small village on the
 banks of the Fal with a heron colony  
 on an island in the middle.There are  
 some abandoned and disused            
 quarries.The roads are very narrow and
 twisty and the river is prone to      
 silting up.There is no industry at all
 in this survey area.
