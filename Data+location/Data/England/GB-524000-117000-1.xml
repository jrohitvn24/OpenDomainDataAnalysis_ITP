		<content>   Through the middle of our area      
 passes the A23 London to Brighton     
 Trunk Road and to the South is a view 
 of the South Downs.                   
   The country roads are winding and   
 narrow and there are clusters of trees
 mostly deciduous.The fields are       
 surrounded by hedgerows,and are used  
 for cereal crops, pasture, winter feed
 and market gardening, including soft  
 fruits. Ditches along the hedges drain
 the clay soil into the River Adur.    
   There are some small ponds which are
 used by licenced anglers.             
   There is one village which is Sayers
 Common, and two hamlets, Twineham and 
 High Cross. To the far South East of  
 the area is a small section of the    
 larger village of Hurspierpoint.      
     To the South of Sayers Common the 
 A23 changes into dual carriageway and 
 is sheduled to be reconstructed soon. </content>
