		<content>{Houses} are built on foundations made 
from concrete. Most houses are built   
with {bricks} but {tiles, stones and   
flints} are sometimes used for         
decoration. There is mortar between    
the bricks to keep them apart. The     
{roofs} are usually sloping but can be 
flat. They are covered with {felt, then
slates, tiles or sometimes thatch.} On 
the roof there are chimneys with       
special pots for the smoke or fumes to 
escape. There are gutters along the    
roof edge to carry rainwater to the    
down pipe and drain. Most houses have  
a garden but these are often small to  
allow more houses to be built at less  
cost. Houses are usually cuboid in     
shape being divided internally to give 
{seperate rooms for dining, relaxing,  
sleeping, cooking and caring for       
personal hygiene.} Rectagular glass    
windows and electric lights are used.  </content>
