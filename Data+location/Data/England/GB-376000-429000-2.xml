		<content> About{1918}children started school    
 at 3 years of age.Most of the children
 wore clogs.The headmaster went round  
 the school to inspect the clogs.If    
 they were dirty the  pupil was sent   
 home to clean their clogs.There was no
 school uniform. The teachers were     
 stern and very strict  and the        
 headmaster punished pupils by giving  
 them the cane.There were no school    
 dinners so the pupils had to go home  
 for dinner.There were 10 classes and  
 the children stayed in one classroom  
 .The desks did not have lids,they were
 just like flat benches.Some of the    
 subjects were                         
 Mathematics,English,Geography,History,
 Reading and Writing.School started at 
 9.00am.and finished at 4.15pm.We      
 obtained this information from two    
 people who were at our school in 1918.
