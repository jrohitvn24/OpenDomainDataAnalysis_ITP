		<content>   Within this area are found mainly   
 individual, detached owner occupied   
 accommodation, with just a few rented 
 houses mainly from land owners such as
 Harnage Grange.                       
   The houses were found along the     
 roads in the two villages of Kenley   
 and Harley on the recent ribbon       
 development pattern.  Other homesteads
 were scattered in isolated outreaches 
 and aptly named such as 'Stone House' 
 and 'Broomcroft'. These were of       
 sandstone and modern brick but        
 thatched cottages with leaded windows 
 are seen as are buildings of wattle   
 and daub.                             
  There is no slum clearance within the
 area but old buildings are found which
 are certainly in need of renovation.  
 An example of this is the wattle and  
 daub barn to be found opposite St.    
 Mary's Church in Harley.              </content>
