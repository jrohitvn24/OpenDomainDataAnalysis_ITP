		<content> Fabdec make milk tanks,plate coolers, 
 and wheat dryers.There are 45 workers 
 there, 15 floor workers and 30 in the 
 offices.The tanks and things go abroad
 as well,mostly to Germany. The metal  
 they make them out of is stainless    
 steel,protected by sticky plastic. To 
 bend the metal into shape you program 
 a computer that is attatched to a     
 machine that forces it into shape,    
 using a pressure of up to 120 tons.   
  When all the pieces are ready they   
 are welded together, polished, and the
 plastic comes off. When the tank is   
 made there is a hole on the top.      
  They also make plate coolers,that    
 pass cold milk through water cooled   
 plates. They buy the sheets and make  
 the parts to fix them together.The    
 milk tanks are to keep milk fresh,and 
 to cool it when it comes from the     
 cows.                                 </content>
