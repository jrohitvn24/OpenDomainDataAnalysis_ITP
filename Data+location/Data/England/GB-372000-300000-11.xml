		<title>11Housing In Norton Area.</title>
		<content>     Some of the housing in our twelve 
 squares is old; many of the houses are
 over 100 years old.                   
   The Hundred House Hotel is old and  
 has 4 storeys in it.  Most houses have
 2 storeys, and some are bungalows.    
 Some of the farmhouses are big.       
   The old school at Ryton has been    
 made into a house, and the playground 
 into a tennis court.  There are       
 several thatched cottages in the      
 Norton area.                          
   The newest house is Nettlestones in 
 Norton, and I think the oldest        
 building in the area is Higford Mill. 
   In Sutton Maddock the Council Houses
 are by the garage and in Vicarage     
 Lane, and in Norton they are in       
 Cheswardine Lane.  Apley Estate owns  
 many houses in the Norton district,   
 but elsewhere it is privately owned   
 property.                             </content>
