		<title>12Population of Ripe</title>
		<content>      Ripe and the surrounding area has
 a mixed population of about 300 adults
 and 40 children. There are more young 
 people moving into the area now. Some 
 houseowners commute to London and some
 work locally. In such a small village 
 it is easy to get to know people and  
 the quality of life is high.          
      Out of 300 adults about 50 are   
 over the age of 60. When seeking a    
 retirement home the village is a good 
 choice as it is level, has its own    
 shops and is a pleasant place to live.
      Children are also well catered   
 for as there is a primary school in   
 the next village, a comprehensive     
 school in Ringmer and a choice of play
 groups for the toddlers.              
      For the middle group there are   
 good reasons to live in Ripe as was   
 said before.
