		<title>16Fordingbridge - 1905.</title>
		<content>    An 87 year old, who has lived      
 throughout his life in this locality, 
 talked about the life and work of the 
 people when he first attended school. 
   The roads, being made of flint from 
 the Downs, were regularly watered by  
 the horse-drawn water cart to keep the
 dust down.{Travel}was by horse-drawn  
 vehicles. There were no cars until    
 about 1905 (Mr.Neave's) and about     
 three years later there were only two 
 more in the area (the local doctors').
 On market day the farmers would       
 travel to Salisbury by train. Very    
 few people had bicycles and about half
 of these were penny-farthings. All the
 men were{employed locally.}They either
 worked on the farm, in the brickyards,
 at Neaves Baby Food Factory (100      
 employees), at the Vineries (30       
 employees), were tradesmen or worked  
 in the local service industries.      </content>
