		<title>20LEISURE &amp; ECOLOGY</title>
		<content> The 1980's have seen a rise in more   
 leisure time.People realise that      
 exercise and fresh air are good for   
 one's health.There is also a growing  
 awareness of the important part played
 by the legacy of landscape in our     
 history.The hedges,lanes and          
 settlements of the countryside tells  
 of our past.                          
 In this area of study there are some  
 beautiful walks and during the last   
 year,under the auspices of Landrake   
 Parish Council,there have been parish 
 boundary walks.It is hoped that these 
 will become an annual event.Much of   
 the walk is through private land      
 (farms) but public footpaths are also 
 used.Here is an opportunity for the   
 local people to gain access to        
 unfamiliar country of their own       
 parish.Each walk so far has resulted  
 in a doubling of numbers of walkers.  </content>
