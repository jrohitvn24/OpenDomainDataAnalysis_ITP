 The district is served by two churches
 _ Sevington/Kingsnorth Church _ both  
 have ancient foundations, the former  
 standing on a Saxon site and being    
 quoted in original Domesday.   There  
 are several free churches, including a
 Methodist at South Willesborough and a
 closed Chapel at Kingsnorth.   There  
 is a general fall_off in attendance   
 and the Sevington Church is only used 
 once a week.  Sevington and Kingsnorth
 were built on higher ground, thus     
 being safer from flooding and visible 
 to the populace at large.   Sevington 
 Church stands in line with several    
 other parish churches and there are   
 stories that they were all used by    
 18th Century Smugglers to give        
 warning!
