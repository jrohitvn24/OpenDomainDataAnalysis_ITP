		<content> Nationally, 5 New Agricultural        
 Landscape experiments were designed to
 assess the value of concentrated farm 
 by farm contacts, encouraging and     
 assisting farmers to carry out        
 wildlife and landscape conservation   
 work. The Bedfordshire Project,       
 including Staploe (1979-1985) covered 
 9 parishes. All known farmers were    
 contacted and approximately 80% became
 involved in conservation work e.g.    
 construction and cleaning ponds,      
 laying coppicing, planting and sapling
 tagging in hedges, woodland and meadow
 management and wildflower sowing. Most
 of the work was in tree planting      
 schemes, ranging from 10 trees around 
 a farmhouse to the planting of new    
 woods up to 5 acres. A total ot 84440 
 trees were planted in 260 schemes.    
 Farmers and their staff were          
 encouraged to carry out the work.     </content>
