		<title>10Branton Village</title>
		<content> The small village of Branton  lies    
 about three quarters of a mile from   
 the larger village of Powburn which is
 the largest centre of population in   
 our area. It has sixteen houses but   
 three of these are now used as holiday
 homes.It  also has a school which, at 
 present, has 28 children from the ages
 of four to nine years.                
                                       
 In times gone by Branton also had a   
 shop and a church but the church is   
 now an antique shop (which is only    
 open at weekends) and the shop stopped
 trading several years ago. Going back 
 further still in time, Branton used to
 have a pub, situated in part of what  
 is now the pottery.                   
                                       
 Sadly, Branton now has no shops or    
 facilities for community meetings     
 with the exception of the school.     </content>
