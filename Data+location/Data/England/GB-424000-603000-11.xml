		<title>11AMBLE HARBOUR</title>
		<content> In{1835 Radcliffe Colliery was opened.
 With it came the demand for a harbour 
 to{export the coal.}In{1837}Parliament
 agreed to the building of a harbour at
{Pan Haven,}which cost{Â£180,000}and    
 took over{ten years}to build. North   
 and south{piers }were erected eighty  
 yards apart, but the north pier needed
{constant attention}because it had been
{constructed of sandstone}which easily 
 weathered.{Radcliffe Colliery}bought  
 the harbour and then later it was     
 taken over by{Broomhill Colliery Co.  
 A{railway line}was built to the       
 harbour and{staithes}were erected for 
 the transfer of the coal to the ships.
 Amble developed as a{port}as the      
{demand for coal grew,}and the town was
 the{centre of the region.}However, in 
 the second half of the{20th century   
 when the{mines closed,}the harbour    
{declined}except for the{fishing trade.</content>
