   The area of our study is bounded    
 by the River Severn on the eastern    
 edge and a ridge of high land running 
 down from Kempsey Common. The         
 settlements are mainly agricultural   
 from Clifton in the south to the      
 southern edge of Kempsey in the north.
 Kempsey is by far the biggest         
 settlement.                           
   The name Kempsey is taken from the  
 local British chieftan Kemys who lived
 in the area before the Romans arrived.
   Kempsey Common dominates the        
 surrounding area .It has been seered  
 from Kempsey by the M5 motorway but   
 still gives beautiful views of the    
 local countryside.Today the river is  
 used mostly by pleasure craft though a
 few small industrial barges come up   
 river from Gloucester.                </content>
