		<content> Most local farmers farm mixed farms,  
 having both arable and beef or sheep. 
 There are two dairy herds but this    
 is not a traditionally milk producing 
 area and the recently introduced milk 
 quota system has reduced the numbers  
 of cows in these herds. Most local    
 farmers used to fatten Hereford/cross 
 calves but recently more are turning  
 to the bigger Continental crosses     
 which take longer to fatten.The calves
 are shedded from October to May and   
 the majority are fed silage, either   
 from a clamp or in big bales.         
 Store sheep are commonly bought in in 
 August but prices were high in 1985   
 and few store sheep are around. Sheep 
 are also kept for their lambs, born   
 around February,and their wool. Sheep 
 have had to be dipped twice this year 
 to eradicate scab, a highly infectious
 disease.                              </content>
