		<title>14LAW AND ORDER IN LONGSTANTON</title>
		<content> In his eleven years here our local    
 policeman has not encountered any     
 really major crime.Most of his time is
 spent in dealing with minor offences, 
 petty theft and vandalisim being the  
 most common.The offenders are often   
 adolescents or young adults, not      
 infrequently soldiers.                
 Our policeman is responsible for other
 villages too, and he has the use of a 
 police panda car . He makes a point of
 being seen in it where he thinks there
 is a risk of trouble _ crime          
 prevention being one of his most      
 important functions. To this end he   
 tries to foster a good relationship   
 with the public, making himself as    
 accessible as possible.               
 In Longstanton the civil police are   
 responsible for the married quarters  
 but the millitary police handle most  
 matters within the camp itself.       </content>
