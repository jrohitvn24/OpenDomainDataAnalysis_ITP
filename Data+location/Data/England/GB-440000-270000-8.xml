		<content>{   FRANKTON FISHPONDS}ARE WELL KNOWN  
 FOR FISHING.{MONKS}BUILT THE FISHPONDS
 BUT MR. PADGET OWNS THEM NOW. THE     
{MONKS}FILLED IT WITH FISH TO CATCH AND
 THEN EAT. THE FISHPONDS ARE SAID TO BE
{HAUNTED.}THE STORY IS, IT WAS WINTER  
 AND A MAN WANTED TO FISH SO HE MADE A 
 HOLE IN THE ICE ON THE FISHPOND AND   
 PUT HIS LINE IN. HE THEN SAW A BLACK  
 DOG HE WENT OVER THE ICE AND GOT THE  
 DOG OUT THEY WERE NEARLY AT THE EDGE  
 WHEN THE ICE BROKE AND THEY BOTH      
 DROWNED. LOTS OF PEOPLE GET SCARED AND
 DON'T GO TO THE FISHPONDS, ESPECIALLY 
 AT NIGHT BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN IT       
 HAPPENED. PEOPLE DON'T JUST GO TO THE 
 FISHPONDS TO FISH SOME GO TO THE      
 FISHPONDS TO LAZE AROUND WHEN IT'S    
 HOT. THERE ARE QUITE A FEW PONDS AND  
 ALL OF THEM HAVE A LOT OF FISH IN     
 THEM.
