		<content>35000.  Although Boroma does have a    
water supply they cannot use it as they
have no way of getting water up        
from the ground.  Their diet consists  
of mainly Maize and other corn type    
products.  Nowadays the people of      
Boroma are mainly settled farmers, not 
Nomads.  Boroma today is a lot like    
Henley would have been about 200       
years ago.  In Boroma they use camels  
to help them, they also keep sheep,    
goats, chickens, and some cattle.      
Until about 100 years ago no-one       
stayed in Boroma.  For a long          
period they didn't have a standard     
language, so their language was only   
written down in the past 50 years,     
when more people lived in Boroma.      
No-one in Boroma pronounces, or spells 
the name in the same way.  Looking at  
some of the spellings you would never  
guess that the word was Boroma.        </content>
