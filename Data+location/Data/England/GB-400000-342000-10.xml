		<title>10My Day(Mr.A.Tildesley Snr.)</title>
		<content>Having just retired I find that my day 
has changed dramatically,although we   
still rise at 6-30,as we did when we   
had to earn a living.I used to have a  
very full life as a plumbing contractor
trying to please my clients &amp; complet- 
-ing all the Clerical work.Now there is
time for a quiet Breakfast without the 
Phone constantly ringing.The new T.V.  
Programmes let us know World Events as 
early as 6-30.I am lucky that I am able
to stroll down to my son's workshop for
a few hours each day to keep my brain&amp; 
hands active.After Lunch I generally do
a few hours in the Garden or I like to 
read or watch the old films on T.V.    
that I missed when I was working.I     
also enjoy the Open University Pro-    
-grammes.I enjoy Sport as a spectator  
when Kara is swimming &amp; she &amp; I play   
table tennis together.
