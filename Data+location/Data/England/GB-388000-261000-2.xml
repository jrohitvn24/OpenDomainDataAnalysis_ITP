		<content> Medical services in Droitwich are     
 centred on the town's Health Centre in
 Ombersley Street.The centre contains  
 three group practices staffed by      
 eleven doctors.One other N.H.S.doctor 
 has a surgery in a house on Worcester 
 Road and there are five dental        
 practices in town.                    
 In 1984, a registered charity,        
 St.Richard's Hospice at home was      
 formed in Droitwich to care for the   
 terminally ill in the familiar        
 surroundings of their own homes.The   
 hospice operates within the Worcester 
 and District Health Authority and this
 year,while maintaining strong links   
 with Droitwich,it moved its           
 headquarters to Worcester. Providing  
 this care currently costs around      
 Â£50000 a year.
