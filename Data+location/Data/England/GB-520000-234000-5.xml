		<title>05N.Herts Equitation Centre</title>
		<content> The centre has been open for about 15 
 years and is very popular. Elaine     
 Firth showed us round. She is 18 years
 old and had worked there for nine     
 months.There are 55 horses all kept   
 separately.They are fed on pony nuts, 
 barley, oats, or a mixture of all     
 three.                                
  Some horses have wood shavings on the
 floor instead of straw. Rex has a     
 single stable as he wrecks everything.
  There is a back yard, a front, and a 
 middle yard where the horses are kept.
 The ponies are kept in a long shed    
 with lots of sections in it.          
  There is a big horse box, it holds   
 six horses and has living quarters.   
  There is an indoor school where      
 children are taught and where horses  
 are schooled.
