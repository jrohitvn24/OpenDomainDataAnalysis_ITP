		<content>  People can go in summer to{Hayford   
{Farm}to pick strawberries,black and   
 red currants,raspberries,gooseberries 
 and vegetables.Mr.Jones first went in 
 to strawberry farming{seven years ago 
 because he wanted something new as he 
 thought the{milk quotas}set by the    
 Common Market might stop him producing
 as much milk as he wanted.            
  He has{5 acres}of stawberries.He puts
 10,000 plants in each acre.In the 1st 
 year they give half a ton of straw-   
 berries per acre.By the 3rd year they 
 will increase their yield to 1 and a  
 half tons.In the 4th year Mr. Jones   
 ploughs them up and sets new plants.He
 chose to use some peaty ground for    
 fruit farming because it was not very 
 good for grazing and the strawberries 
 grow well there.He uses{10 acres}alto-
 gether for fruit and vegetables.Its a 
 very popular place in summer!         </content>
