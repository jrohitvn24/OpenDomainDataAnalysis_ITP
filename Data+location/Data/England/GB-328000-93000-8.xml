		<title>08      Farming Dairy</title>
		<content> Dairy farmers keep cows for milk. The 
 sheds need to kept very clean. The    
 farmer has to make sure that          
 everything he uses is clean. Cows need
 two gallons of water a day. They like 
 to eat grass, cowcake, hay and silage.
 They need to eat it because it        
 produces milk.                        
                                       
    In the morning the farmer gets up  
 and brings the cows from the field. He
 puts the cows in the dairy, then he   
 puts the teat suckers on the teats.   
                                       
    Thery're milked and the milk goes  
 in a big tank. The milk lorry then    
 comes and takes the milk.             
                                       
    It goes to the depot and is        
 pastuerised and put into bottles or   
 made into cream, butter, and cheese.
