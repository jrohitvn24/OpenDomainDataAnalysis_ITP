    We have very much enjoyed studying 
 our {DOMESDAY PROJECT BLOCK}and we    
 have learnt a great deal about our    
 village of Bar Hill and the           
 surrounding area.Local people also    
 learnt much about their own village   
 when they visited our display of      
 Domesday Project work and             
 questionnaire survey results.We would 
 also like to think,possibley in vain, 
 that our local council will also learn
 much from our survey results and their
 implications.
