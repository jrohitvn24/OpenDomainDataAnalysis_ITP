		<content> Block offers a modest view of the     
 renowned beauty of the Chiltern Hills.
 Woodland covers approximately 50% of  
 area, whilst remainder is given over  
 to farming. Where contours will allow,
 farming has been directed to crop     
 cultivation or pasture. The pasture   
 offers feeding for the considerable   
 number of sheep with some cattle in   
 area. Communication confined to minor 
 roads, narrow lanes and tracks, which 
 for the most part allow for single    
 lane traffic only. Routes are         
 punctuated by prepared places for     
 passing. Block is riddled with Public 
 Footpaths and is a favoured walking   
 area. There is much wild life         
 including inter alia: deer, pheasant  
 and partridge. There are three small  
 hamlets, Pishill, Southend, these are 
 served by main water supply but no    
 main drainage system.                 </content>
