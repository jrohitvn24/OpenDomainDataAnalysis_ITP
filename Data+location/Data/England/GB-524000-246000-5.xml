		<content>     Wrestlingworth is in the middle of
 important farming land in East Anglia.
 During our survey we looked at several
 farms. Home Farm owned by Mrs.        
 Randall;Grange Farm owned by Mr.      
 Bates; Common Farm owned by Mr.       
 Simpkins; Water End Farm owned by Mr. 
 Wilson; Church Farm owned by Mrs.     
 Banks; Manor Farm owned by Mr.        
 Woodcraft. All the farms around       
 Wrestlingworth grow cereals, wheat and
 barley. Some grow peas, beans,        
 potatoes, and sugar beet. Most grow   
 oilseed rape. Only one farm had cattle
 and sheep.
