  The church is a Norman church it is  
 900 yrs old. No-one has ventured to   
 date the stone arched porch. The last 
 marriage was about four years ago. The
 last death was in 1982, and the last  
 christening was in 1983.              
     There are two bells in the church.
 One is dated back to AD 1638. The     
 other bell spent a number of years at 
 Banwell Caves as the bell for the     
 clock there.It was retored to the     
 church by Mrs. Whitby in 1915 as      
 a memorial to her husband.            
  The church is very small.
