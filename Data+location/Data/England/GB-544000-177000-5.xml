		<content>When you SKIP you use a skipping rope. 
You can sing a rhyme when you skip.You 
have two people skipping. The rhyme    
goes..."I like coffee...I like tea...I 
like Navjyot in with me...I            
don't like coffee...I don't like tea.. 
I don't like Navjyot in with me.Then   
you carry on, the person jumps out.Then
someone else jumps in and so on.       
                                       
When you play FORTY FORTY you have to  
get lots of people and one is on 'it'. 
The rhyme goes...nop force around me,  
up or down me,side by side me,forty    
forty,scat..and you run and hide. When 
you have hidden they will be counting  
to 44. If they see you they will say   
"forty forty I see Navjyot", then      
you're on 'it'.
