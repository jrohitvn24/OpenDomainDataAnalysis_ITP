		<title>09THE AREA I LIKE BEST</title>
		<content> The place I like best is{Christchurch 
{Quay}because it is a nice place to go 
 for a walk in the summer.It is fairly 
 quiet there with a nice atmosphere,I  
 like the wildlife.I often go with     
 younger cousins to feed the ducks and 
 swans.It has a nice view.My grandad   
 likes to fish there,while we walk     
 around.In the summer there are plenty 
 of people fishing or boating.There are
 a lot of amusements there for younger 
 children,there is a playground and a  
 paddling-pool,there is also a         
 crazy-golf.There is a cafe with       
 refreshments .Sometimes on the green a
 fair comes which is usually good      
 fun.The old buildings are excellent   
 fun,especially the ruins.It's great   
 investigating them.My nan likes going 
 to the{Quay}because there is a nice   
 sweet shop nearby.
