		<title>12The Village Windmills</title>
		<content>   In Faldingworth there were two      
 windmills. There was the postmill     
 which doesn't stand any more and the  
 cap mill which still stands in ruins. 
   The post mill was wooden and was    
 about 16m.high. The span of the sails 
 was about 24m. long. It used to be in 
 a lane near Orchard Farm. It was near 
 a stream but it was used for grinding 
 corn. It blew down in a gale just     
 after the first world war and was     
 never rebuilt.                        
   The cap mill is a brick mill and    
 some grinding stones still remain as  
 decorations in the farm yard opposite 
 the mill. One of the villagers        
 remembered that when he was a boy he  
 used to grab a sail as it came round  
 and hang on then let go as swept him  
 up in the air.
