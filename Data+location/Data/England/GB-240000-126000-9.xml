 GRENVILLE COLLEGE-an independent      
 Woodard Foundation School,established 
 30 years ago. It caters for 346       
 boys,nearly all borders. Many come    
 from overseas and there is a special  
 unit for the treatment of children    
 suffering from dyslexia.              
   This unit has a high reputation and 
 is recommended by the London Teaching 
 Hospitals.                            
   The main school  building was       
 formerly Moreton House, home for many 
 generations of the Studley family.    
     The grounds  extend to 58 acres,  
 most of which is used as playing-     
 fields. These adjoin the playing-     
 fields of Bideford Comprehensive      
 Scool.
