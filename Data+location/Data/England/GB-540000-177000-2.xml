		<content> Many families still have to struggle  
 but efforts are being made especially 
 in changing the pattern of housing. A 
 community spirit is developing. People
 moving from high rise flats to own    
 houses appreciate the improved        
 circumstances.                        
 Schools use Woolwich free ferry quite 
 a bit because few open spaces are     
 within easy reach.                    
 North Woolwich British Rail station   
 has been converted into a rail        
 museum. The ticket office and other   
 buildings are full of memoribilia and 
 there is a working steam engine which 
 operates most Sundays. The Royal      
 Victoria Gardens is a well established
 park with a recreation area and people
 enjoy watching the boats on the river.
