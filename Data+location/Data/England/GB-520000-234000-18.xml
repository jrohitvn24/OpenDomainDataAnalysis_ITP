		<title>18A Usual Day</title>
		<content> Today was Friday 12th July 1985 and an
 ordinary day at school - only 1 week  
 to go before we break up for the      
 school holidays - I am looking forward
 to it because I am going on a canal   
 boat for a week.                      
 It was the usual day at school today, 
 I got to aschool at 8.45 am. and Mrs  
 Kiln called us in at 5 minutes to 9.  
 We had Assembly with Mr Barratt who   
 talked about Sports Day which is next 
 Monday. I am going to be in the Relay 
 race.                                 
 After Assembly we did some Maths and  
 English and after Break we had        
 Physical Education.  Then Mrs Elliott 
 read us a story about a sheep getting 
 stuck and a shepherd rescuing it.     
 Then it was lunch time. After lunch we
 worked on our Sheep project - I am    
 doing some weaving from some wool I   
 have spun.Then I went home and played.</content>
