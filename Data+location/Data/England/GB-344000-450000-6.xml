		<title>06The Cockerham Sea Wall</title>
		<content> Protecting the area from the ravages  
 of the tides stands the Sea Wall, a   
 structure approx.10ft.high,40ft.thick 
 at base and 3.25miles long constructed
 of sand and clay faced with blocks and
 pitched.Its origins are obscure,but   
 maintained by the Estate until 1926,  
 thence by a farmers co-operative,     
 Crookhey Estate Embankment Committee, 
 ceded to the River Lune Catchment     
 Board in 1948,latterly managed by the 
 NWWA.Dissected by 3 drainage channels 
 ,all with water operated sea doors,   
 Bank End Pool,Patty's Pool and the    
 River Cocker with extra electrically  
 operated doors.A new wall,privately   
 financed,South of R. Cocker was built 
 and washed away in 1977, flooding a   
 vast area.The NWWA took over the      
 project and a wall,completed 1980,    
 reclaimed 125acres,with an SSSI of    
 17acres conserved for Natterjack Toad.</content>
