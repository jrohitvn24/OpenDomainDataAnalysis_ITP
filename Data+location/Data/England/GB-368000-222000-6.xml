		<content>   There has been a{Scout Group}in     
{Aston Ingham}for fifteen years, made  
 up of a Cub Pack, Scout Troop, and    
 a Venture Scout Unit- the last taking 
 the name{Abbey de Cormeilles Venture  
{Unit}from the old Abbey in Normandy to
 whom the living at Aston Ingham was   
 given by William the Conqueror.       
   The Group draws its members from    
 many of the surrounding villages,     
 being the only rural group  in a very 
 large area. The Group has built its   
 own Scout Hut, which also serves as a 
 District Training Hut for the Ross-on 
 Wye area and as a camp-site for       
 visiting troops.It is also used by a  
{Brownie Pack.}The site was once Glebe 
 Land and is rented from the Church    
 Commissioners.                        
   The Scout Group plays a vital part  
 in bringing the children of the       
 area together now with schools closed.</content>
