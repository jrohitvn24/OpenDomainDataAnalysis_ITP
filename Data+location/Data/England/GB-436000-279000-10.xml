		<title>10THE PAPER BOY</title>
		<content> The paper boy's name is Bill.I know   
 him through a friend.He collects the  
 papers from Potters Green             
 Newsagents.He delivers twice          
 daily,once in the morning and once in 
 the evening.Each week he knocks on the
 door to collect the money.He delivers 
 the Sun and Mirror to our house.      
 The paper boy comes on a bike so he   
 can get around more quickly.His round 
 takes him 30 minutes.After his rounds 
 he goes back to the shop and gives in 
 the left-overs and the money he has   
 collected.                            
 Bill delivers to certain numbers.He   
 goes to 1,3,5,9,13 Narberth Way.He    
 goes to different streets to          
 deliver.Sometimes when it is raining  
 people ask him if he would like to    
 come in and have a cup of tea.
