		<title>14TREES OF WYCHWOOD</title>
		<content> It was recorded early this CENTURY    
 that {24 old Oaks }planted before     
{WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR'S }time were    
 still standing.The girth of a very    
 tall oak standing in {1985 }had a     
{girth }of {365 cm.}The most numerous  
 trees today are the {Maples &amp;         
{Syca-mores. Henry 11 }is said,to have 
 used drinking bowls at his court made 
 from {WYCHWOOD'S NATIVE MAPLE. Ash,   
{Beech,Hazel, Yew,Plane, }and {Lime}   
 are all commonly growing throughout   
 the forest.{Spindle,Silver Birch,     
{Hornbeam, Sallow, White Poplar,Scot's 
{Pine,}and {Wayfaring Tree,}are fewer  
 in number. In a {PLANT SURVEY }of a   
 small area, roughly in the middle  of 
 the forest {29 different species }of  
 tree were recorded. Some of these how-
 ever are not our native trees but     
 introduced ones. {
