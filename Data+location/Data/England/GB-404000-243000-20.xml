		<title>20VEGETABLES IN THE VALE</title>
		<content> A great many growers have small       
 parcels of land, ranging from five to 
 twenty acres.  Tractors, Merrytillers 
 and even horses are used on the land. 
 Irrigation is from the river and      
 brooks, whilst spray lines have to be 
 regularly moved.  The most popular    
 winter crops are brussel sprouts and  
 leeks, whilst runner beans, peas and  
 courgettes do well in summer.  A local
 greengrocer buys most of his produce  
 from the wholesale markets in         
 Evesham; the more exotic fruits from  
 London.  Pineapples, kiwi fruit, and  
 melons are delivered twice a week. His
 day starts at seven o'clock and       
 finishes at half past five.  His      
 busiest days are Fridays and          
 Saturdays.  Although cabbage is grown 
 locally the most popular vegetables   
 are cauliflowers and carrots which    
 come from other areas.                </content>
