		<content> A DAY IN THE LIFE OF JOANNA DEE       
                                       
 My name is{Joanna Dee. }I am aged     
 eleven.  My mum teaches and my dad    
 works with computers.                 
 I wake up at 7.00 a.m. and every      
 morning I do some exercises, but by   
 7.20 a.m. I am dressed.  I go and     
 clean out my rabbit's hutch and give  
 him food. After my breakfast of cereal
 I collect my dinner money and school  
 bag.  At 8.30a.m. I leave the house   
 and meet my friends by the canal      
 bridge.  We arrive at Velmead School  
 at 8.46a.m.                           
 School usually starts with assembly   
 and then back to work.  We work in    
 groups in maths and we do topic work  
 and art.. In our school there is no   
 timetable.  At the end of the day I   
 return home to watch T.V. or play.
