		<title>20REFLECTIONS ON CLATFORD</title>
		<content> This piece of work produced by the    
 children of Clatford Primary School   
 attempts to summarise the{LIFE STYLES}
 of the {VILLAGERS} living in Goodworth
 Clatford and Wherwell.The work has    
 been produced during the Summer Term  
 of 1985 and has involved a great deal 
 of research and {ENVIRONMENTAL}work in
 the villages and the surounding       
 countryside.The children from class 5 
 at the school went on four local {    
{WALKS}with Mrs.Simmonds,Mr.Horne and  
 the vicar..Michael Tristram.The       
 children wrote down their impressions 
 of the villages and drew sketches of  
 interesting features.Notes and        
 drawings were then used to produce a  
 great deal of interesting information 
 about our "patch" for The Domesday    
 Project.The work has been recorded on 
 our computer,shown to parents at a    
 school Open Day and displayed locally.</content>
