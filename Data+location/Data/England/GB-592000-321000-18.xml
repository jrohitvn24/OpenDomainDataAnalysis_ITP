		<content>   Brisley Green is a large open area  
 of grass S.E.of the church and near   
 the Bell pub.It is sometimes called   
 the Common. The seven  acres of       
 grassland are split into two parts by 
 a road. The Green has tufts of grass  
 here and there and there are ponds    
 near the boundary. A bridge crosses   
 over the ponds. From the Green you can
 see the top of the church,houses and  
 trees. There is a restaurant on one   
 side called The Commons.              
   Animals such as horses,cows,sheep   
 and goats graze on the common.        
 Sometimes sheep run across the road   
 and get killed.                       
   On one corner of the Green there is 
 a cricket pitch. It is used by Brisley
 Cricket Club on Saturdays and Sundays.
 Lots of people come to watch the games
 of cricket.
