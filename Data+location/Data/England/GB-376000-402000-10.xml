		<title>10Ryders Farm - horses</title>
		<content>     I love on{Ryders Farm.}Originally 
 there were three fields with the farm.
 Two were sold to a farmer from Preston
 for his{beef cattle.}We had one field 
 and split it into two. There is a{barn
 and old{stables.}Near the old stables 
 we built some new ones. We{ploughed   
 the field and put fencing along the   
 boundary. In winter the farmer takes  
 his cattle to his farm near Preston.  
     Our farm has{19 horses stabled}on 
 it. It is Â£6 a week for the use of the
 field and stabling. I have a horse at 
 our farm which I got for Christmas.   
     All around our farm are fields and
{Clifton Moss.}There are other farms:  
{Unity Brook Farm, Clifton Moss Farm,  
{Clifton House Farm.}They all{rent out 
{stables and fields.}In winter you have
 to buy hay, straw and horse food. It  
 costs about Â£16 a week, in total,to   
 keep a horse in winter.               </content>
