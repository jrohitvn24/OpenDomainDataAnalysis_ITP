		<content> The present Manor of Dogmersfield was 
 erected by Ellis St John, the main    
 front in 1728 and the great west wing 
 in 1744.Sir Henry Paulet St John      
 married Jane Mildmay in 1786 and      
 adopted her name. The Manor remained  
 in the family till 1933, when it was  
 occupied by Reed's School.In 1956 the 
 De La Salle  Brothers took it over as 
 a Roman Catholic training seminary    
 until Daneshill School moved in in    
 1973.They left in 1979. In 1981 two   
 thirds of the building was destroyed  
 by fire. In 1983 confirmed plans were 
 made to preserve the 1728 north front.
 The building is now the European      
 headquarters of Amdahl International, 
 a leading American computer company.  
 1985 sees the reconstruction of the   
 west wing and new additions are       
 planned.
