 with his wife, who is a teacher at    
 Stonehenge School, Amesbury, and Ian  
 and Sarah their children.             
 Mr Hunter is an expert with computers 
 and is always ready to help sort out  
 new programs. He teaches Maths to the 
 3rd year junior group.                
 One of his hobbies is Photography and 
 many excellent pictures and films have
 been taken of school children at work 
 and play. He is also an enthusiastic  
 rambler, and with his family has      
 explored many walks around this       
 country and on the Continent.         
 On Tuesdays after school he runs a    
 keen group of young ornothologists and
 his extensive knowledge of birdlife   
 has aroused great, interest amongst   
 the children of the club.
