		<title>08  A LOCAL FARMER</title>

  We went to talk to a farmer to ask   
him some questions about his land. Most
of his land is grassland which is used 
for Beef cattle and sheep. The rest is 
arable for growing barley and wheat.   
                                       
  The radio station which is not       
suituated in our area owns part of one 
square and the farmers who rent the    
land are not allowed to plough the     
fields where the masts are.            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
