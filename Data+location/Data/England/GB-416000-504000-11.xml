		<title>11PHEASANT REARING-GILLING W.</title>
		<content>  Hen pheasants start laying their eggs
 in April or May  and can lay up to 50.
 In the wild, only about 6-10 hatch out
 but  hand- reared  pheasants  usually 
 hatch 75% or more.They then go out at 
 day old chicks or are reared on by the
 pheasant farmer until they are 6 weeks
 old. As  day old chicks  they start on
 pheasant crumbs (very fine pellets)and
 by the time  they come to be  released
 at  6-8 weeks  old  they  will  be  on
 larger  pellets mixed  with  wheat. As
 tiny chicks  they need plenty of  heat
 on  them  and  gas lamps  are  usually
 used.The heat is reduced as they grow,
 until at 4-5 weeks none is needed.    
  The pheasants go into a release pen  
 at 6-8 weeks,when they can fly out and
 find food. They are flying free by    
 October  when  the  shooting  season  
 starts.
