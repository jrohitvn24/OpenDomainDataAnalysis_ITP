		<title>04The Lambton Worm.</title>
		<content>{The adventures of Lord John Lambton   
{are told in a well known legend:-     
    One Sunday John went fishing while 
 everyone else went to church.He fished
 for hours but caught nothing except a 
 worm which he threw down the local    
 well.He then went off to the Crusades.
    While he was away the worm grew    
 enormous and began eating cows,sheep  
 and children.When John came back he   
 consulted the local witch.She said,   
 "You will have to wear a suit of      
 armour with spikes so that when the   
 worm wraps itself around you it will  
 split into pieces which will float    
 away in the river.In return for my    
 advice,once the worm is dead,you must 
 kill the first living thing that you  
 see."The first thing that John saw was
 his father and as he couldn't kill him
 the witch cursed the next nine        
 generations of his family.            </content>
