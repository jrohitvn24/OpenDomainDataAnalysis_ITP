 called{David and Goliath,}written by  
 Mr N.Walton.On Wednesdays Mrs.Walton  
 takes us again for drama, which is    
 linked with choir.Thursday is for     
 roller skating. The infants roller    
 skate in the front play ground under  
 the supervision of parents, while the 
 juniors skate in the large back play  
 ground, under Mrs Cox's supervision.  
 Friday is hockey day.Mr Murphy, the   
 Headmaster takes us. Everybody enjoys 
 after school activities, because they 
 are good fun. If you are interested
