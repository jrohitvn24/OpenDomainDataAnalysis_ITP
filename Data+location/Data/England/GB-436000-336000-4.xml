		<title>04SIXTH FORMERS' VIEWS</title>
		<content> At one Chaddesden{secondary school}   
 there is a very small sixth form.     
 These 16 to 18 year old students      
 expressed their views.                
                                       
 They felt that they had too many free 
 periods at school and often spent     
 these in town. They enjoyed being     
 treated more like adults by school    
 staff and had a relaxed atmosphere in 
 their own common room.                
                                       
 They felt that A level study was      
 considerably harder than previous     
 school work because of finding time to
 do the required reading.              
                                       
 Most of the sixth formers had  a      
 Saturday job but none of them had made
 a decision about a job or further     
 study after school.                   
                                       </content>
