		<title>17In a manner of speaking</title>
		<content> There is no particular way of speaking
 peculiar to Wolvey since it is much   
 too small a place to have its own{    
{ACCENT}or{DIALECT.}                   
 So many new people have moved into the
 village from other areas that there is
 a mixture of accents. A person who has
 lived and worked in Wolvey for many   
 years may speak with an accent rather 
 like Hinckley people of South         
 Leicestershire or north of Coventry.  
 A common error in{GRAMMAR}is to use   
 the word "were" in place of "was",i.e.
 "It were a beautiful day yesterday".  
 Similarly one might say "we was"      
 instead of the correct "we were".     
 There are other examples such as the{ 
{MIS-PRONUNCIATION}"fount" instead of  
 "found" but this is not very          
 widespread or obvious.
