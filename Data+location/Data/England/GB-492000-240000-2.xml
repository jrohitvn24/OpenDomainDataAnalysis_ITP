		<title>02THE RED ARROWS</title>
		<content>   On  Wednesday  17th  April, most  of
 Holywell  School   interrupted  their 
 lessons to watch the famous{Red Arrows
 air display team perform in the  skies
 over Cranfield.                       
   As  we  watched from  various points
 around  the  school, the{ Red  Arrows 
 performed  many  stunts including fake
 collision  courses,  the  square   and
 diamond and the "Concorde" formations.
 They  coloured the  event with red and
 blue vapour trails left behind as they
 performed many  complex and  carefully
 rehearsed formations.                 
    This  display was part of the  Rank
 Xerox show  "Innovation  85", attended
 by{ Prince  Michael of  Kent, }who was
 there to present  medals to the pilots
 and groundstaff of the{Red Arrows.
