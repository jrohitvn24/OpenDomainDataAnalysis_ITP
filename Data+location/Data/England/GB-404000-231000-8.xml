		<content>{Didbrook Fields}is by owned Dansk     
 Planteforaedling. It was founded in   
 1975 and has 100 acres of land. Only 4
 people work on the farm. They work an 
 average of 8 hours a day. Mr.Thomas is
 in charge of the farm. They test      
 grasses for football pitches, bowling 
 greens, parks, silage, etc. The       
 grasses are sent from Brussels in     
 Belgium. They own 81 cattle and they  
 test the grasses on the cattle. In the
 larger plots they grow silage grasses 
 such as Perenniel and Italian Rye,    
 Coxford, Timothy, Lucerne, Red and    
 White Clover. At 09.00 in the winter  
 and 10.00 in the summer they record   
 the results of the Stevenson's screen.
 For drainage in the fields they use   
 para ploughs and pipes. Para ploughs  
 dig deep into the earth to let the    
 water drain away.
