		<content> We play{kick the can.}You have a can, 
 someone is "on" and someone kicks the 
 can. You all hide and the person who  
 is on runs to get the can and put it  
 back on the spot, then he has to look 
 for people. If he sees you he has     
 to tell you the name of the tree or   
 bush you are behind if they call out  
 the wrong bush you say false-call and 
 every one runs in and then the game   
 starts again.*************************
 A{skipping game}Sandra plays goes like
 this:" All the boys in our school     
 aren't very nice, except for ..." When
 they say "for" you have to choose a   
 boy's name and then it goes...."he's  
 all right.  Took me to the pictures,  
 sat me on his knee and said darling   
 Sandra will you marry me?"Then it goes
 "yes, no" until you stop skipping. If 
 it is "yes" then you love him if it is
 "no" then it means you don't love him.</content>
