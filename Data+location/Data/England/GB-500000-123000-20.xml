		<title>20SURVEY OF PETWORTH RURAL NE</title>
		<content> The survey and photography of this    
 area has been carried out by five     
 members of the Bosham Women's         
 Institute, founded in 1921 as part of 
 the National Federation of Women's    
 Institutes, whose purpose is to enable
 women in rural areas to meet and work 
 together in craft and cultural        
 activities. At the monthly meetings   
 there is a speaker on some subject of 
 general interest, or an entertainment,
 followed by tea, to enable members to 
 meet their friends. Bosham W.I.       
 undertook this survey because of the  
 link between Bosham on the coast and  
 Buckfold, north of the Downs. For at  
 least 400 years, until the 1920s they 
 shared the same Lord of the Manor. The
 five W.I. members who worked on the   
 Survey were Angela Bromley-Martin,    
 Peggy Cook, Aylmer Gick, Carol Hall   
 and Irene Marwood.                    </content>
