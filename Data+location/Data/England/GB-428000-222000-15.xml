		<content>  Painting is one of the most popular  
 arts, with several artists in the     
 village using oils, water colours and 
 acrylic paints.   Their subjects are  
 landscapes, animals and still lifes.  
 Another popular hobby is hand         
 knitting, using pure wool, nylons and 
 other man made fibres or a mixture of 
 these, making a variety of garments   
 and using varied patterns ranging from
 very simple to very complicated.      
  Crochet is also a pastime using      
 similar fibres to hand knitting.      
 Embroidery, tapestry, dressmaking,    
 wallhangings, patchwork and collage   
 are all forms of needlework which are 
 widely practised.                     
  Evening classes in the nearby town   
 cater for adults wishing to learn lace
 making and woodwork.   These are      
 patronised by several residents of the
 village.                              </content>
