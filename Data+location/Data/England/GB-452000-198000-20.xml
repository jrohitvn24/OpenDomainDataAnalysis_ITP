		<title>20Radley Village Pub.</title>
		<content>The Bowyer Arms, (named from the old   
Radley family,) is owned and           
maintained by the Abingdon brewery,    
Morlands. The premises include a       
lounge bar, Public bar and gardens,    
and ample parking space. Very much a   
social centre, the pub offers all      
licensed facilities for drinking on    
the premises, and an off licence for   
outside sales. Activities offered are  
darts, (with competitive teams,) bar   
billiards, pool, and table games       
traditional to pubs, like cards and    
dominoes. The lounge bar has a juke    
box. There are periodic "raffle        
evenings", usually Fridays, when many  
prizes of food and comestibles can be  
won. These evenings are very popular,  
as are those when other entertainment  
is provided "live",- as perhaps a      
singer guitarist. The management serve 
lunchtime cooked meals and snacks.     </content>
