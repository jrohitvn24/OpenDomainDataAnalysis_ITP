		<title>14TRADE, PADIHAM MARKET LANCS</title>
		<content>   There has been a market for around  
 200 years. However, because of its    
 location on the river bank, flooding  
 occurred and in 1884 new land was     
 acquired.                             
   In 1956 the market closed. 27/3/84  
 saw the re-opening of a new market at 
 a cost of Â£120 000.                   
  This permanent outdoor fixture, of   
 modern materials is enhanced by       
 landscaping and local stone.          
   Stall keepers and local inhabitants 
 feel that Sat may not have been a wise
 choice. Many shops take half-day      
 closing, and local shoppers prefer to 
 travel to the larger towns of Burnley 
 Accrington and Blackburn.             
   Therefore 4/9/85 saw the addition of
 a Wed market, not to replace Sat      
 however. Whether the market will      
 succeed in re-vitalising the town is a
 matter for speculation.               </content>
