		<content> My name is Julia, and I come from     
 Great Harwood.  I am here for the     
 weekend with my friend Hariet.        
 Blackpool is O.K. to come for the     
 weekend when the sun is shining, but I
 prefer to go abroad where the sun is  
 guaranteed.  Blackpool also tends to  
 be quite pricey compared to home, and 
 just getting into some of the pubs and
 clubs is a problem as you are always  
 told you need to be a member.  One    
 thing which we like about Blackpool is
 that it takes less than an hour to get
 here, so we tend to come here quite   
 often, several times a year in fact - 
 but that is mainly because there is   
 not much to do in Great Harwood.      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
