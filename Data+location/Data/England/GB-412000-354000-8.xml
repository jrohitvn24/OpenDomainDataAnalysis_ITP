		<content>{Alstonefield Livestock}               
     In Alstonefield there are just    
livestock farms that keep sheep and    
various breeds of cattle - beef and    
dairy.  There is one farmer who keeps  
pigs for Paul's Feed, a company that   
sells sheep corn, cow corn and pig     
corn.  The owner of the farm will get  
a profit out of the total that the     
pigs make.  There is a donkey farmer   
who keeps all types.  He used to keep  
mules and ponies but he has sold them  
all.                                   
{Farm Machinery}                       
     There are not many farms that     
have important machinery like forage   
harvester, balers and round-balers,    
because there are contractors who have 
these implements.  So, most people     
hire contractors to do their           
harvesting of the grass.
