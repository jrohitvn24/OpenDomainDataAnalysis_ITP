		<content>   The area consists of a flood plain  
 surrounded by an upland area known as 
 the Woolhope Dome. The average size of
 farm is around 44 hectares.In the past
 this average was much lower at around 
 22 hectares,but recently many farms   
 have been bought &amp; consolidated into  
 larger units.                         
    Although wheat &amp; barley are grown  
 on the flood plain,the farmers main   
 source of income is from livestock.The
 main types of livestock kept are      
 sheep, beef-cattle &amp; some pigs. Hay is
 grown for fodder but is supplimented  
 by "bought in" compounds. Hops, apples
 and other fruit are also grown but    
 not always as a main source of income.
    The general attitude to the E.E.C. 
 &amp; its quotas is fairly positive,      
 although admittedly the area has not  
 been affected by quotas because of the
 types of farming practised.           </content>
