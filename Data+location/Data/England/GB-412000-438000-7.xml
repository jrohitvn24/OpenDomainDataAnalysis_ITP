		<title>07JOHN AT THE FARM,GILSTEAD</title>
		<content> In a morning I go down to{the farm}and
 then let the dog go out so it goes to 
{round the cows up.}They can go in for 
{milking,}as we muck out.We get a full 
 wheelbarrow and then go up this steep 
 ramp to a muckspreader.All the muck   
 goes in to the muckspreader.It is all 
 ready so we go back on the tractor.   
 After,we have our breakfast at home   
 and then we go{muckspreading.}Iknow   
 muckspreaading is done because it all 
 makes the grass grow better for cattle
 grazing. We go down Sheriff Lane  and 
 it is an  old bumpy road. Then we went
{walling}in the landrover.There were   
 some nettles near the wall.The stones 
 had fallen down and we built it up    
 without cement.We went back in the    
 landrover to put on the trailer for   
 the auction.At the{cattle auction}my  
 Dad bought a cow.It was at Otley and  
 cost more than a hundred pounds.      </content>
