		<title>07Agriculture in North Yorks</title>
		<content> Agriculture is the main occupation in 
 the area,either working in farming or 
 farming related industries. In recent 
 years there has been a decline in the 
 number of small holdings in favour of 
 the larger farms. This may be due to  
 the unwillingness of land owners to   
 rent out fields &amp; some families have  
 had to sell land for financial        
 reasons. Around Cropton,the{Forestry  
{Commision}farms huge areas of forest &amp;
 this is a source of employment outside
 the area. Animal farming is the main  
 enterprise although the larger farms  
 concentrate on cereals,potatoes &amp;     
 other cash crops. The smaller farmer  
 works on livestock rearing,some       
 relying heavily on grants available   
 for hill sheep &amp; cattle. Mechanical   
 farming,modern fertilisers &amp; new high 
 yield crops have made great changes to
 the traditional farm.                 </content>
