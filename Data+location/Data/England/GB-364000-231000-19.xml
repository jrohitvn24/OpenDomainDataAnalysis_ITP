		<title>19Much Marcle Youth Club</title>
		<content> The youth club was founded in 1979    
 to give the children of the village   
 somewhere to meet on Wednesday        
 evenings. It is organised in two      
 groups. The first is for 6-11years and
 meets from 6.30-7.45 pm.  There are 22
 members in Junior Youth Club and they 
 play rounders, snooker and table      
 tennis.  The Senior group has 25      
 members and meets after the juniors   
 have gone home.  They have darts,     
 indoor hockey, cricket and swimming.  
    This year the club is going to     
 Butlins at Barry Island.  The trips   
 are very good because the members can 
 go exploring on their own.            
    It costs 30p a night to go to Youth
 Club but it is really worth it.  It is
 great fun and there is nothing else to
 do.
