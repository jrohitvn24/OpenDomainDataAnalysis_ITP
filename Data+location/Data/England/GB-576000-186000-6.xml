		<title>06Housing in Sth Benfleet.</title>
		<content> Most of the houses are built on land  
 that was sold as plots when farms were
 broken up during the agricultural     
 depression in the 19th century.Special
 trains were run from Fenchurch Street 
 to bring Londoners to these sales and 
 food was laid on in large tents to    
 provide refreshment,including Kosher  
 victuals when there was an unexpected 
 influx of Jewish buyers.Plots were    
 sold for about Â£10 to Â£35. Only four  
 small farms are left.They are engaged 
 in mixed dairy and arable farming and 
 also have riding stables.Two of the   
 farms are situated on Benfleet Downs  
 and form part the Hadleigh Country    
 Park.In addition,four fruit farms     
 produce soft fruit,as well as apples, 
 plums and pears and invite their      
 customers to pick their own fruit.One 
 of the two large nurseries advertises 
 nationally and supplies by mail order.</content>
