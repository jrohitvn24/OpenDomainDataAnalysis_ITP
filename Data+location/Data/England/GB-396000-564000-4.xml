   The Parish Church of St.Andrew,     
 founded by St.Wilfrid in the 8th.     
 century shows evidence of all periods 
 from earliest Saxon building,still    
 entire.In 1985 the entire roof is     
 being renewed at a cost of 50,000     
 pounds,the present generation being   
 very aware of their heritage and      
 responsibility to the future Christian
 community.The electoral roll numbers  
 456.The vicar has assistance from     
 three retired clergy and the          
 neighbouring small parish of Halton is
 also in his care.The Roman Catholic   
 community,lacking their own church    
 building,use St.Aandrews on Saturday  
 evenings and some festival days.The   
 Methodist Church,with 120 members,    
 meets in Princes Street Chapel.Study  
 and Fellowship groups cater for       
 children and adults in all Churches.  </content>
