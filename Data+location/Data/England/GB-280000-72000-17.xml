		<content> At{Youngs Seafood}there were scallops,
 crabs and sharks.One shark weighed 135
 pounds.They handle 4 to 5 tons of crab
 a day.There are a couple of freezers  
 which keep the fish fresh and the     
 coldest was minus 20 degrees.To help  
 them work there was a machine which   
 was made in America.The price of it   
 was Â£6000.This separates the shell    
 from the meat.There was another       
 generator powered by gas.It was very  
 hot in that room.In one of the rooms  
 there were ten sharks and the man who 
 was talking said a man was carrying a 
 shark and he cut his hands badly.There
 are several ways to kill the crabs.One
 way is to put a knife through the     
 middle of the eyes and that pierces   
 the brain,or they can be boiled. The  
 fish come from local ports such as    
{Brixam and Dawlish.}The fish are then 
 exported to many European countries.  </content>
