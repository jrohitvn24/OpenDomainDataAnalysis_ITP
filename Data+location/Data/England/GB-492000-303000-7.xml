		<content> There are two schools in our area. One
 is the Edith Weston C.P.This school   
 has 149 pupils. The number fluctuates 
 because it mainly accommodates        
 children of R.A.F. North Luffenham.   
 The other school is North Luffenham   
 C.of E. This school was opened in 1969
 to accommodate children from North    
 Luffenham, Barrowden, South Luffenham 
 and Morcott. In 1967 these four       
 villages had their own Primary        
 schools. The children attending the   
 present North Luffenham School are    
 North Luffenham 51, South Luffenham   
 32, Barrowden 48, Morcott 16 and other
 villages 4. Two buses are provided    
 each day, one bringing children from  
 South Luffenham and Morcott, the other
 from Barrowden.                       
 Midday meals are provided at school.Of
 the 151 children, 2 go home, 105 have 
 a school meal and 46 bring sandwiches.</content>
