		<content> My hobbies are climbing trees and     
 collecting Embassy cigarette coupons. 
 On a night I go climbing trees with my
 friends. Not far from us there is a   
 wood called Granny Lawson's Wood. It  
 is near the Little Hole (a deep pond).
 People say that Indians used to live  
 there. Another thing I like doing     
 catching tadpoles and frogs. The      
 Embassy coupons I collect are a kind  
 of money. You can buy things like pens
 and pencils, paper all sorts of toys  
 and other things. You can buy electric
 things like hairdryers, vacuum        
 cleaners, tongues - in fact all the   
 things you can think of.              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
