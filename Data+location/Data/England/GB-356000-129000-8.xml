		<title>08The Lydford Churches</title>
		<content>   The church of St Peter,West Lydford 
 originated in the 12th century but was
 rebuilt in 1844 by Rector W.          
 Hungerford Colston.                   
   Standing in an idyllic setting      
 beside a weir on the river Brue it has
 two fine stained glass windows,a      
 beautifully carved wooden eagle       
 lectern and a clean and cared for     
 look.The 15th century font is all that
 remains of the old church.            
   Less often used is St Mary's, East  
 Lydford,built on a new site in 1866   
 after the original 14th Century church
 beside the river was constantly being 
 flooded.Ruined gravestones mark the   
 spot.The carved wooden pulpit and     
 Norman font were brought from the old 
 church and an unusual alabaster plaque
 on the West wall shows St George      
 fighting the dragon.
