		<content> In and around Lower Stoke Holy Cross  
 much of the land is farmland and marsh
 land. About twenty people wwork on the
 farms now whilst most of the people   
 work in Norwich. Half a mile to the   
 east lies Upper Stoke Holy Cross.     
 About eight hundred people live in    
 Stoke Holy Cross, and all are very    
 kind and helpful.                     
 There is one shop in the village which
 sells most things. There are many     
 clubs and societies in the village    
 with the church taking a leading      
 part in many. There is one school, the
 six teachers there teaching the 120   
 children from Stoke Holy Cross,       
 Caistor St. Edmunds, and Shotesham.   
 There are five large farms in the     
 village.
