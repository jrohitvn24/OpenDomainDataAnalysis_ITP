 in the core of the Charnwood area

 Whitwick area. Many of these outcrops 
 are quarried today for roadstone in

 attractive buildings in the area make 
 use of the local granite. Quarrying is
 the main industry in the region. The  
 area as a whole is used mostly for    
 pasture and cereal crops with some
