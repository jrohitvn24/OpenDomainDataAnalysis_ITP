		<title>18THE NATURAL HABITAT</title>
		<content> The area is chalk with no surface     
 water. Arable farmland covers most of 
 the area and there are few grazing    
 animals. Natural cover for wildlife   
 still exists in several forms mainly  
 hedgerows and isolated coverts. Dr    
 Hooper's formular was used to date the
 hedgerows i.e.Age of Hedge=(Number of 
 Species x 110) + 30 years. The hedges 
 average 5 or 6 species in such a      
 strtch suggesting an age of about 550 
 years. Archive evidence is unavailable
 to confirm this but the age of local  
 settlements and the sunken nature of  
 some lanes suggests that they could be
 even older. Hawthorn is the most      
 common species. A visit to Gifford's  
 Covert GR 326455 showed it to be a    
 heavily overgrown area of deciduous   
 woodland. The trees are covered in    
 creepers and the lowlying ground is   
 damp moss_covered clay.               </content>
