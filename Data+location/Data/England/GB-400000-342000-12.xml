		<content>Place Names-MONKHOUSE-Long ago Monks   
walked from Abbey to Abbey.When they   
walked from Dieucress(Leek) to Croxden 
they used to rest at Monkhouse.They    
chose a high place so that the local   
people could light beacons to show the 
Croxden Monks that they had arrived    
safely.THE BIRCHES-Once Birch trees    
grew on what is now a modern Council   
Estate.MEADOW DRIVE-originally the     
Meadow belonged to the Hospital &amp;      
a herd of cows was kept to provide     
for the needs of the Hospital(now      
in the process of being demolished     
&amp; re-built).QUEEN ST was once called   
Gravel Pit Rd,it's name was changed    
when Queen Victoria came to the        
throne.TAPE ST.was called New St.      
until 1791 when J&amp;N Philips came to    
the area with their looms &amp; built a    
tape mill (now Kwik-Save Supermarket)
