At the heart of the Village of Spratton is St Andrew's Anglican Church. Although the regular congregation is small, it remains an important part of the community and is used by both the schools in the village for special services such as Harvest, Christmas and Easter. Spratton remains a broadly Christian community with the Christian ethic promoted by the Church of England Primary School and Spratton Hall School.  The Methodist Chapel within Spratton has been a residential dwelling for many years, and the Roman Catholic Church, also closed about twenty years ago, is now the Scout Hut.  Those wishing to worship within other Christian denominations and Religions must travel further afield in to Northampton.   &lt;br />
