		<content> Most of the Roads in the area are     
 unclassified, except for the B.6243   
 from Longridge to Clitheroe, which    
 passes through Knowle Green.   There  
 is a two-hourly bus-service from      
 Preston to Clitheroe along this road, 
 and a similar service runs from       
 Preston to Chipping through Thornley. 
 There is at present some worry about  
 whether the projected privatisation of
 bus services will cause hardship in   
 the area, although most of the        
 families are car-owners.   Taxis take 
 rural children to school.             
                                       
 Local business also transport their   
 employees to and from work owing to   
 the lack of public transport.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
