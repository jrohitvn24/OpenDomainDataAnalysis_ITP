		<title>08PLESIOSAURUS</title>
		<content> The Plesiosaurus monument is built of 
 stone on a roundabout. On it is a big 
 sign saying BARROW UPON SOAR. Below   
 the writing is the Plesiosaurus, a    
 dinosaur found in Barrow Limestone.The
 roundabout is at the junction of three
 roads, Bridge Street, High Street and 
 Sileby Road. The monument was put up  
 in Commemoration of the Coronation of 
 Queen Elizabeth II. The roundabout is 
 called "Jerusalem". It was built in   
 1953. The skeleton's remains are kept 
 in Leicester Museum. The Plesiosaurus 
 has a nickname. It is the "Red        
 Herring". It was given this nickname  
 because before it was built there was 
 an old house on the site chosen for   
 the monument, and the people of Barrow
 thought the house was worth more than 
 a monument to the dinosaur.
