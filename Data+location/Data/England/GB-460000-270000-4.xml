There are six shops in the village of  
West Haddon. There are two food shops, 
two antique shops, one pine furniture  
shop, one clothes shop, and a          
hairdresser's shop. Of these shops the 
two food shops are used most often and 
by most people. As well as selling food
one of these shops sells newspapers and
it is also the village post office.    
The two antique shops are both owned by
Mr.Hopwood.                            
The clothes shop, called "Matilda's",  
appears to be used by older rather than
younger people in the village.         
The pine shop has not been open very   
long but already appears to have       
attracted a large number of customers  
especially at the week end.It sells    
both new and renovated furniture.      
The hairdresser's is a very useful     
amenity used by many people.           </content>
