		<content>     My mother gets up at approximately
 7.30 a.m. and prepares breakfast for  
 the rest of the family.After we have  
 all gone to school or to work she     
 begins the day's housework.           
     At about 11.15 a.m. my mother     
 leaves on her bicycle for work.She is 
 a mid-day assistant at a nearby       
 school.She arrives at the school at   
 11.45 and for the next one and a half 
 hours supervises the children during  
 their meal-break.At 1.15 p.m. she has 
 her own meal in the school canteen and
 leaves at about 2 p.m.                
     During the afternoon mum will do  
 the shopping and then return home to  
 continue with the housework and       
 prepare the evening meal.After this   
 she completes her jobs and then       
 relaxes by watching television,       
 gardening or playing badminton.
