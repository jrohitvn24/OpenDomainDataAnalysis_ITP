		<title>05The Choirs of Stithians</title>
		<content> Stithians Male voice choir was formed 
 in 1947, and the ladies choir in      
 1966. Both choirs have about forty    
 members consisting of adults of       
 different ages from teenagers to      
 senior citizens. Stithians Male voice 
 choir is well known throughout        
 Cornwall. They practice at Stithians  
 church hall every week. The furthest  
 they have been is Wales. They were    
 going  to the U.S.A. but at the       
 last moment the trip was cancelled,   
 due to the cost. Their performance in 
 the 1OOO Voices Concert, at the Royal 
 Albert Hall in London, was videoed.   
 They have been recorded by Sentinel   
 record company. The Male voice choir  
 goes to the Princess Pavilion at      
 Falmouth, every two weeks, during the 
 Summer to sing with a guest soloist.  
 The ladies choir have also been       
 recorded by Sentinel.                 </content>
