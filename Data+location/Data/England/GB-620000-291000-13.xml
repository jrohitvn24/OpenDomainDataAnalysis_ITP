		<title>13Industry - Flour Mill</title>
		<content>   {Long Stratton Mill}produces flour  
 and animal pellets, most of which are 
 distributed locally to farmers and    
 merchants. The products are made from 
 locally produced grain. The pellets   
 vary in size from less than 1cm to    
 about 6cm and they are fed to pigs and
 cattle. The flour is made by rolling  
 wheat and sieving out the bran and    
 husk. The bran is bagged for sale and 
 used in the production of pellets. The
 flour which is plain is sent for      
 retail.                               
   {The mill is built on the site of a 
{former windmill, of which the 200 year
{old tower remains.}Thirteen workers   
 are employed by the company and a     
 fleet of lorries provides transport   
 for the raw materials and products.   
 The mill has been owned by the same   
 family for many generations.
