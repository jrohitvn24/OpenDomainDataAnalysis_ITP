		<content>    The Hollinwood branch of the       
{Manchester and Ashton canal}is now    
 disused. It has been cut off from the 
 main canal but is a fishing ground and
 for recreational use.  The humped back
 bridges are preserved and at Daisynook
 an aqueduct is incorporated into the  
 country park. The canal is also       
 remembered in the decoration of a new 
 public house," The Streetbridge,"     
 built recently to replace an older pub
 of the same name.                     
     The{Droylsden railway station }is 
 closed but the remains are visible.   
 The branch line Southwards from here  
 is closed, filled in and in many      
 places its course is obliterated. The 
 pub here is still called "The Railway"
 and has some railway memorabilia.     
     Looking to the future, the route  
 of the final link to the{M.O.R.R. (the
{M66)}has recently been decided.       </content>
