		<content>   At Grampound Road ten people were   
 asked what amenities they would like  
 in the village. They wanted a Doctor's
 Surgery, bank, swimming pool, Aero    
 park, more buses and improvements to  
 the shops. Half wanted the village to 
 stay the same while the rest wanted to
 see change.                           
   The children of Ladock School like  
 living in a rural area because it is  
 quiet, clean and open. When asked what
 amenities they would like in the      
 village they wanted a fish and chip   
 shop, swimming pool, tennis court,    
 roller skate park and a riding school.
 However, they concluded that, with all
 these things, Ladock would no longer  
 be a country village and so they      
 wouldn't enjoy living here anymore!   
 Having said that, the existing        
 amenities are threatened with closure 
 unless there is some development.     </content>
