  There is no hobby in which more than 
 15% of the population participate. The
 most popular hobby is gardening, which
 14% of the people do. This multitude  
 of gardeners brings many welcome      
 customers to the various{nurseries}and
 garden centres in the area.           
  Shooting and riding are equally      
 popular with 8% of the people doing   
 them, making them the second most     
 popular hobbies. The horses and guns  
 are owned principally by farmers with 
 grazing land to spare.                
  Among the women, knitting, needlework
 and crocheting are the most prominent 
 activities, with reading being the    
 common denominator for all.
