		<title>18The School Day in 1985.</title>
		<content>  My Mmum woke me at about eight to get
 up and have some breakfast before     
 going to school, when I got down my   
 sister Gemma was still eating her     
 cereal. After breakfast I got together
 my England Kit for the sports day     
 which was going to be today, before   
 long two freinds arrived to walk with 
 me to school. At school we always     
 arrive about half an hour early so we 
 could have a game of football before  
 school starts.                        
   When the doors open at 8.50a.m. we  
 go in ans start work on the Blackboard
 Maths which are some revision sums our
 teacher Mr Hodges puts on the board,  
 while we are doing these on silence he
 calls out the register and the lunch  
 register, that is those that will be  
 staying for lunch on that particular  
 day.
