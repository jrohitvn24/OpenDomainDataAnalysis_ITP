		<title>12Ecology - Bird &amp; Plant life.</title>
		<content> The land in our area is chiefly rough 
 grazing or moorland. Grouse are shot  
 on the moors, once the open season    
 begins on the 12th of August, "The    
 Glorious 12th". Over recent years the 
 Grouse population has diminished,     
 chiefly because the practice of       
 burning the moors to encourage new    
 shoots to grow has become uncommon.   
  Around the reservoirs there is an    
 abundance of bird life such as        
 Dippers, Lapwings and Kestrels.       
  Wild grasses such as the great       
 Millet, annual meadow grass, black    
 grass and green pauicle grass grow    
 here, interspursed with wild flowers. 
 On the moors heather and bilberry are 
 to be found, although the heather is  
 less widespread than in times past.   
  Animals to be seen include Rabbits,  
 Foxes and less common Weasels or      
 Stoats.                               </content>
