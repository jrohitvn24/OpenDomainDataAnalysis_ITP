		<title>15BREAGE CHURCH</title>
		<content> The Church is named after St. Breaca, 
 a female Saint who came from Ireland. 
      The earliest building on the site
 was probably a wooden oratory. The    
 earliest vicar known was in the year  
 1219. The present Church building was 
 built between 1416 and 1466.          
      There are many interesting       
 features. These include wall          
 paintings inside the Church which were
 originally completed in 1470. They    
 depict St. Christopher carrying a     
 Christ child and a number of          
 fragmentary scenes. These were covered
 over during Tudor times and           
 rediscovered in Victorian times. There
 is a small amount of stained glass    
 which survived Cromwell's soldiers.   
 There is also a King Charles Letter   
 written in thanks to his loyal Cornish
 subjects in 1643.
