		<content> Although the area is predominately    
 urban and residential, including  West
 Bromwich town centre,almost half of   
 the twelve square kilometres is       
 designated "Green Belt "land. Called  
 the  Sandwell Valley , this area      
 provides unique leisure opportunities 
 for local residents and for visitors. 
 There are four eighteen hole golf     
 courses, a nature reserve and trail, a
 water sport centre and a municipal    
 park. Linked to the nature reserve is 
 a Royal Society for the Protection of 
 Birds Study Centre. The ruins of the  
 12th century Sandwell Priory provide  
 archaeological interest .Dartmouth    
 Park includes eight tennis courts,a   
 miniature golf course  and  many      
 football and cricket pitches. There is
 also a paddling pool and boating lake.
 Special annual functions include the  
 volleyball tournament and the fair.   </content>
