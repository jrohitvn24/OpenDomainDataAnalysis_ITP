		<title>14St.Matthew's Church Wookey</title>
		<content>  The original church on this site,    
 which belonged to the bishops of Bath 
 and Wells, is believed to have been   
 built between 1136 and 1166. Tradition
 has it that the church commemorates   
 the spot where the fallen were buried 
 after a battle between Saxons and     
 Danes.                                
  An interesting feature of the chancel
 arch pillars is the two long squints  
 put there so that the priests at      
 secondary altars could see the stage  
 the service has reached at the main   
 altar                                 
  About 1555 the support wall of the   
 south aisle was removed and the south 
 east chapel was built, probably as a  
 mortuary chapel was Thomas Clarke,    
 brother of the Bishop of Bath and     
 Wells, who died at the Manor House,   
 and whose tomb stands between this    
 chapel and the Sanctuary.             </content>
