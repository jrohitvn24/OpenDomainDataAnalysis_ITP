 REFURBISHED AGAIN AND NOW IT IS NOT   
 ONLY A{BINGO HALL}BUT ALSO  A{SNOOKER 
{HALL.}THIS AND THE NEW{MANHATTAN      
{COCKTAIL BAR}IS SOMEWHERE FOR YOUNG   
 PEOPLE TO GO.                         
 20 YEARS AGO IT WAS VERY QUIET, RATHER
 LIKE A VILLAGE. THERE HAS BEEN A      
{COMMUNITY CENTRE}BUILT IN HANDSWORTH  
 AVENUE. ON A LARGE PATCH OF WASTE LAND
 NEXT TO SPACKMAN HOUSE{OAKHILL SCHOOL 
 WAS BUILT.THE{LEVEL CROSSING}CONSISTED
 OF 2 LARGE GATES AND HAD A PERSON     
 OPERATING IT; NOW IT IS{AUTOMATIC}WITH
{BARRIERS.}THE{TRADNG ESTATE}IN        
 LARKSHALL ROAD HAS BEEN EXPANDED.     
 THERE ARE NOT VERY GOOD SHOPS IN      
 HIGHAMS PARK ANY MORE.{DETERIORATION  
 HAS COME WITH{VANDALISM.}THERE IS MUCH
{GRAFFITI}ON WALLS AND SUBWAYS. THE    
 LAKE HAS RUBBISH DUMPED IN IT. THE    
 TRAFFIC AND PARKING IS HORRENDOUS.    </content>
