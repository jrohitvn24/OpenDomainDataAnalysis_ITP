		<content> Bank Hall is in the main street next  
 to Curlew Crafts, once that was one   
 house owned by the Greenwoods.The     
 house has small windows and a stained 
 glass door, green window panes and    
 a brown pebble dashed front.Bank hall 
 doesn't have a cellar it has a loft   
 but it is used as an insulation loft. 
 The house has a green iron doorway    
 which is Elizabethan.There are green  
 window frames and a date that says    
 1765.The house was split up in the    
 1800,s and recently became Curlew     
 Crafts.The grandma of one of the boys 
 in our group owns Bank Hall but before
 that the Greenwoods used to live there
 generation after generation. The      
 dampness of the walls is reasonable   
 considering how old the house is but  
 the walls are very thick.
