		<content> Our "block" lies between the          
 relatively industrial towns of the    
 west coast of Cumbria and the Lake    
 District National Park.               
 The nearest towns are Whitehaven and  
 Workington some five or six miles to  
 the west, the nearest lakes being     
 Loweswater and Ennerdale roughly three
 miles to the east.                    
 The school that has undertaken this   
 survey is only just out of the area as
 the village of Arlecdon is divided by 
 the southerly grid line. Subsequently 
 less than half of the village and its 
 amenities are not evident but would   
 be included in the grid block:        
             03040516                  
 Consequently it will be seen that our 
 area is essentially very rural.
