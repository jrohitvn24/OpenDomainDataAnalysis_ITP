		<title>04ST.PATRICK'S CHURCH</title>
		<content> In 1899 the whole of St.Patrick's     
 Church ,with the exception of the     
 tower was rebuilt. The chancel is     
 raised eight steps above the nave in  
 order to accommodate the vestry       
 below.The inside of the church has    
 been made very beautiful with the     
 organ and the lovely carved gallery   
 and the beautiful stained glass       
 windows.We use the church for special 
 days like                             
 harvest,Easter,Christmas,weddings and 
 funerals and christenings.In the      
 1980's more people are coming to the  
 church.The hymns that we sing are less
 dreary than they were.Mr.Degg came to 
 the church 7 years ago. He has been a 
 vicar for about 21 years.             
 The work of a vicar's wife is very    
 important when the vicar is out, his  
 wife answers the phone.
