		<title>08The Bishop of Lewes</title>
		<content> The village if Litlington is joined   
 for worship with West Dean and is     
 served by one vicar.Litlington seems  
 to have well attended services,but    
 West Dean has a scant congregation.At 
 present both are in the charge of the 
 Bishop of Lewes,who combines pastoral 
 duties with the work of a bishop.     
 Bishop Peter is Sussex born,and with  
 his identical twin,the Bishop of      
 Jarrow,is a co-founder of "The        
 Community of The Glorious Ascension". 
 Living the life of a monk he wears a  
 brown habit and sandals instead of the
 customary purple cassock.He lives in  
 the Rectory at Litlington where he    
 helps young men to adapt to adult life
 before starting their chosen career.He
 is very well known in Sussex,         
 broadcasting on television and radio. 
 He has a jolly,kindly personality     
 and is a popular religious figure.    </content>
