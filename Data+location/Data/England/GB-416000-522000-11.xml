		<title>11SHARPLEY PLANTATION</title>
		<content> Most of the trees were planted in     
 1944 so it is 40 years old.  The trees
 are beech, conifer, pine, larch they  
 fell them down when they grow to about
 10 m.  All the timber goes to         
 different people, the hard wood is    
 sold to merchants and the rest go to  
 make stakes.  They stake their hard   
 wood trees for longer than their      
 conifers.  Staking means that you give
 the tree support until it is strong   
 enough to support itself.  Sharpley   
 Plantation is 24 hectare.
