		<content>On Sunday morning I got up at half past
nine.I dressed and then had breakfast. 
My mum washed up and I dried the       
dishes.I watched my dad as he started  
to mix some concrete.He is using it to 
build our house.After that my mum      
 tarted to get the dinner ready.       
1 played with my Lego and began to make
a machine gun.This took quite some time
and then my mum said that it was dinner
time.My nan came to visit us and she   
stayed for dinner as well.We had roast 
beef and Yorkshire pudding with cabbage
and carrots.                           
After dinner I went outside and played 
on the swing for a while.I decided to  
have a barbecue.I started cooking      
beans,sausages and potatoes on a fire  
in my back garden.It smelt good and    
tasted really delicious!I watched some 
television and then at nine thirty I   
went to bed.                           </content>
