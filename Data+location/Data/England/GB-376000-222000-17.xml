		<title>17THE COMMUNITY OF HIGHLEADON</title>
		<content> Highleadon straddles the B4216 and    
 lane to Upleadon. It has a small,     
 'aging' population. Highleadon and    
 Rudford have a joint Parish Council,  
 meeting every 6 weeks. Currently, the 
 Council has a Bill before Parliament  
 to change Common Land into a Village  
 Green at the Highleadon-Hartpury road 
 junction. They are also concerned that
 the former Methodist Chapel, closed in
 1983, becomes a private dwelling and  
 the graveyard is maintained. Community
 life centres on Rudford Hall built as 
 a 2nd World War memorial. The Women's 
 Institute meets monthly on 3rd        
 Wednesday and regular whist drives    
 provide income for hall funds. The    
 Rudford and Highleadon Table Tennis   
 Club have 6 teams in the Gloucester   
 League and built their own hall       
 alongside the Village Hall in 1984.
