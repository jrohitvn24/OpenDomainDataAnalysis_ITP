		<title>07Fremington Parish Council</title>
		<content> The parish council does all kinds of  
 things.They help other councils by    
 giving advice about things like       
 planning, which they know about       
 because they are local people. They   
 write letters to other councils when  
 they want things done in the village. 
 Sometimes people are co-opted onto the
 parish council and others get voted   
 on. Mr. Metcalfe, the chairman of our 
 school governors, was co-opted.       
 Elections are held every four years.  
 Few people vote. Many of our parents  
 knew little about the parish council  
 when we asked them about it.          
 The parish council does not have much 
 to do with rates. Two of the governors
 of our primary school are on the      
 parish council. They are Mr. Metcalfe 
 and Mr. Moody.
