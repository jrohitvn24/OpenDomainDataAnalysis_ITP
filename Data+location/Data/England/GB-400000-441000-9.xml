		<title>09BARN CONVERSIONS.</title>
		<content>  The most fashionable trend at the    
 moment seems to be to convert old     
 barns into houses.                    
  Recently one of the end barns at     
 Middle Redcar Farm was converted into 
 a large house which includes two guest
 rooms with adjoining bathrooms,a large
 lounge with a fireplace,a snooker room
 and a patio.It took about eight months
 to complete.This has now been named   
 Redcar Wood Farm and joins the        
 existing two cottages at Middle Redcar
  The barn at the opposite end of the  
 row is now up for sale for a          
 conversion along with 1\ acres of     
 land.Also White Field Farm has put in 
 for planning permission to convert the
 adjoining barn and dairy into another 
 house.                                
   Prior to conversion the barn would  
 cost about Â£30,000 and after,sell for 
 at least twice as much.               </content>
