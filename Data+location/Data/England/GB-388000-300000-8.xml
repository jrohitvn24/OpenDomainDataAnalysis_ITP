Mrs Edna Perline James Campbell was the
first of her  family  to  emigrate from
Jamaica to England. On arriving in this
country  in 1961 she  found  she had to
get used to a new way of life in a much
colder  country. Finding  work  was not
easy,and it was a year before she found
a job  in a diecasting  factory  making
aircraft  parts. She then  stopped work
for  a  while  and  more  of her family
joined   her  from  Jamaica. Later  she
found  work in a  local  hospital  as a
nurse  and  remained  there  until  she
settled  down  to raise a family. Later
Mrs James decided  to go to college.   
Twenty four years after arriving in the
U.K. Mrs James has a family of four and
teaches   needlework  in Wolverhampton.
