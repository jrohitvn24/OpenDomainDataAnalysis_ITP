		<title>14FRED DIBNAH-STEEPLEJACK</title>
		<content> The local steeplejack and television  
 personalty, 47 year old Fred Dibnah   
 lives at Park Cottage on Radcliffe    
 Road.                                 
 He has repaired chimneys since the age
 of 24 (before which he was a joiner)  
 and he has demolished approximately 60
 without the use of explosives.   He   
 has also removed the spire and lantern
 from St. Stephen &amp; All Martyrs Church 
 of England.                           
 He recalls that his most frightening  
 moment was when he was repairing the  
 sides of a well.                      
 At the age of 7 he became interested  
 in steam engines, at fairgrounds. He  
 now owns 3 steam engines, the first   
 which he bought from a Welsh scrap    
 metal merchant for Â£175 and after     
 restoring it,called it Alison after   
 his wife. He spends his spare time    
 working with steam engines.           </content>
