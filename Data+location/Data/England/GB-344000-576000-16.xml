		<content> The population is smaller than it     
 would have been 50 years ago.There are
 about 45 dwellings permanently        
 occupied and 10 used as holiday       
 accomodation.There is no public       
 transport,but most have cars.There are
 13 farms in the block where cattle and
 sheep are kept.One big estate lets its
 agricultural land to local farmers.   
 Pheasants are reared.Only a small     
 minority of residents are from past   
 generations of locals.There is a      
 Parish church,Public Hall,school,Post 
 Office/shop,&amp; 2 public houses.Doctors 
 are in Longtown and Newcastleton.     
 There are moblie shops and deliveries.
 Agriculture does not emplpy large     
 numbers now due to efficient methods  
 od farming.Public ntertainment is     
 scarce but there are social gatherings
 in the Hall.Almost everyone knows     
 everyone else and relations are good. </content>
