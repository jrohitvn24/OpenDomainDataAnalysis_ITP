		<title>02DONCASTER CARR'S ECOLOGY</title>
		<content> Doncaster, Balby and Potteric Carrs   
 are on an{ecology roundabout.}In the  
 time of Henry VIII the area was part  
 of Hatfield Chase: a marsh and part   
 of the largest deer chase in England. 
   In the following centuries a duck   
 decoy was built and the ducks caught  
 were given to the poor of the area.   
 The decoy went when the area was      
 effectively drained by John Smeaton in
 the 1760s but the place name survives 
 in Decoy Bank and Decoy Sidings.      
   Drainage turned the land over to    
 farming with hedges, fields and small 
 plantations of trees. 100 years later 
 this all changed when the area was    
 covered by railways and colliery      
 deposits. The full circle was turned  
 when Rossington pit to the S.W.       
 undermined the area in the 1960s      
 causing subsidence which returned it  
 to wetland marsh.                     </content>
