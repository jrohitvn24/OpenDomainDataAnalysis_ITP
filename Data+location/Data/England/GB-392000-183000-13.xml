		<title>13Kingsmead Mill</title>
		<content> It is 3KM  south east of {Malmesbury.}
 In the early 19th  century it was 3   
 cottages and a mill but was later     
 changed to 1 house and mill.It is made
 of Cotswold stone and the stables  are
 135 years old.The mill workers lived  
 in the cottages.The mill was used for 
 grinding corn then in 1953 for        
 grinding animal food.It was milling   
 until 1962.In 1982 it was bought by   
 film producer David Puttnam who made  
  "Chariots of fire"and "The Killing   
  Fields".He has converted the stables 
 to two flats,an office and a Movieola 
 which is a room for editing films.Some
 times scriptwriters stay in the flats 
 while writing film scripts.A public   
 foot path passes west of the house    
 beside the weir.The mill produces it's
 own electricity.The river drives a    
 turbine.Surplus electricity is fed    
 into the national grid.               </content>
