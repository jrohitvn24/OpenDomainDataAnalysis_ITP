		<title>03Riccall's Lost Railway Line.</title>
		<content>   The Railway in Riccall,Mount Park   
 had been there for many years.        
   All sorts of trains ran on the      
 lines, like the 125 Intercity trains  
 between York and London,and smaller   
 trains,for the local York/Selby       
 service.                              
   The County Council are digging up   
 the old line for a by_pass road around
 Riccall.The railway now (22.6.85.) is 
 nearly cleared.                       
   The new line has been built on the  
 other side of the River Ouse.         
   The National Coal Board  built the  
 new line for British Rail,as the old  
 line was to be effected by subsidence 
 from the new Selby Coal field.
