		<content> A railway line runs through Marton and
 Birdingbury.In bygone days barges and 
 railways were used before the car     
 became popular.For a long time the    
 railway was the only means of trans_  
 port.The bus service was introduced to
 the villages in the late forties.With 
 the increase in popularity of the car,
 the use of the railway and bus service
 diminished.The railway line was       
 finally closed down 30 years ago.The  
 bus service is now just one a day.    
 Children are carried to school on a   
 school bus or in a car.The local      
 population now feel that to live in a 
 village one needs to have the use of a
 car.
