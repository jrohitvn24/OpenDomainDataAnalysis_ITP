		<title>09Working in Maple Cross</title>
		<content> Working in Maple Cross can be very    
 convenient,especially for the part    
 time mum.                             
  My mum works in Maple Cross her      
 feelings are:if anything should go    
 wrong at school,she could be there    
 within a 10 minute walk ,which would  
 mean no travelling expenses i.e no bus
 fares, no train tickets and no petrol 
 expenses, just the use of your legs   
 and feet.                             
  My mum works at Cementation, she is a
 typist.Several parents who have       
 children at our school,work in Maple  
 Cross i.e there are shops in Maple    
 Cross and two pubs,where you could get
 a job and also an industrial estate.  
  The people in Maple Cross are very   
 friendly.I use the shops nearly every 
 day.There is a food shop,a newsagents 
 and a hairdressers.Things such as     
 crisps and biscuits can be expensive. </content>
