		<content> Walton's Farms consist of Little      
 Walton's farm and Great Walton's      
 farm. They grow Wheat and barley and  
 rape.At great Walton's farm we saw a  
 400 year old barn which had lovely    
 beams.                                
 An interesting feature of farms in the
 area is that many of the farmhouses   
 are no longer the homes of the farmers
 farming the land. Farms are getting   
 larger and many of the houses are     
 either sold separatly from the land   
 and lived in by people who have       
 nothing to do with the land, or are   
 allowed to fall into disrepair. Three 
 Chimneys farmhouse is for example     
 derelict. It is interesting to note   
 that this farm got its name because   
 each of its chimneys lies in one of   
 three parishes.
