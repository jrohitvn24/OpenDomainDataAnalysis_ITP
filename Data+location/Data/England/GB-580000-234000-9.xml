		<title>09Thatching At Wickham St.Paul</title>
		<content> On Thursday 25th April we talked to   
 Mr. Potter,a master thatcher and Mr.  
 Mann his apprentice about their       
 thatching work on a{cottage roof}at   
 Wickham St. Paul's Village Green.     
 They were using reeds from Scotland.  
{Reeds}also come from Norfolk.They use 
{straw}for the top of the roof.The     
 pattern at the top is individual to   
 each Thatcher.Reeds are up to eight   
 feet long and last for one hundred    
 years.It takes two months to thatch a 
 cottage roof.Straw lasts for fifteen  
 to twenty years.                      
{Tools used by a thatcher are :        
{Leggett}- to straighten reeds in place
{Shears}- to cut reeds and straw.      
{Rake}- to comb out straw.             
{Mallet}- to drive pegs into reeds.    
{Hammer}- to bang in iron hooks driven 
 into rafters.                         
{Wire netting}- to keep birds out.     </content>
