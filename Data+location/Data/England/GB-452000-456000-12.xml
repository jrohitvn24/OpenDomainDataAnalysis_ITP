		<title>12  The Sidings Restauraunt</title>
		<content> On the 1st of July 1985 a new         
 restaurant opened in Shipton.Its      
 unusual because its made out of       
 railway carrages.The owner Mr.B.      
 Gemmell was once chief passenger      
 manager for British Rail and is very  
 interested in trains.When he retired  
 he decided to build The Sidings.As Mr 
 Gemmel and his chief chef are Scottish
 there is a Scottish taste to the      
 menu.The passengers will be able to   
 taste dishes like{grilled loch tay    
{salmon,Cullen skink a Scottish soup.}A
 three course meal would cost Â£7.00.The
 diners will dine in the coaches       
 decorated chocolate,cream,gold.They   
 will be served by waitresses dressed  
 in the same colour Two of the coaches 
 are made into 8 bedrooms.1 for the    
 disabled and a bridal suit.The        
 restaurant is good for train spotting 
 because its next to the railway.      </content>
