		<content> The{parish church}of St Peter,        
 Wormbridge, is one of thirteen served 
 by the Ewyas Harold team ministry,    
 which comprises a{team rector,}a team 
 vicar and a curate. Services are held 
 in the church once every three weeks, 
 by the clergy in rotation. The{Book of
{Common Prayer}services of Mattins,    
 Evensong and Holy Communion are used. 
 There are about three funerals and two
 christenings each year, but no        
 weddings have taken place during the  
 past three years. About 15 people     
 attend services regularly, at         
{Christmas and Harvest Time}there are  
 about 100 in church.                  
 Historically the church has had links 
 with its neighbour at St.Devereux.    
 Each church appoints its own          
 churchwardens but there is a joint    
{PCC,}with representation on the       
 Abbeydone Deanery synod.              </content>
