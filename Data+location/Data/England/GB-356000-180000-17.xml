		<content>   I wear dresses most of the time in  
 the summer, or shorts. On rainy days, 
 I wear jeans and sweat shirts. Today I
 am wearing a skirt and a T-shirt. The 
 colour of my skirt is pink and a white
 T-shirt. I have three pairs of shorts,
 one red, one green and one white. I   
 have lots of dresses and jumpers. I   
 have a jogging suit and many blouses. 
 In the winter I wear jumpers and      
 jeans. When I go out to play I wear   
 coats, scarves, gloves, boots and a   
 hat.                                  
  The most fashionable trainers are    
 either white baseball boots or top    
 name daps. For trousers we wear       
 "Baggies", which are trousers which   
 are tight around the ankles and waist 
 and baggy around the legs. They have  
 about five pockets which all have zips
 on them. We also wear sweatshirts. We 
 also have anoracks.                   </content>
