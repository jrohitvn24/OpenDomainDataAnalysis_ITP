		<title>03WINTER ON OTMOOR</title>
		<content>When we walked along Otmoor Lane it was
very muddy.The trees were bare of their
leaves.Just one or two were hanging on 
in the cold wind.It was clear that     
animals live there because the frozen  
prints of birds and cattle were to be  
seen in the heavy,thick,grey mud.There 
were also the tracks made by horses    
hooves as their owners exercised them. 
The puddles were frozen over with      
sheets of ice.The moor was alive with  
ducks and swans feeding on the river   
or on the wet areas in the fields      
nearby.The swans moved like huge,white 
ghosts and the ducks poked their necks 
under the water.You could see some     
willow trees on the banks of the       
ditches in the distance.Somewhere      
across the flat moor there was the     
sound of a hunting horn and the hounds 
yelping as they led the hunt.
