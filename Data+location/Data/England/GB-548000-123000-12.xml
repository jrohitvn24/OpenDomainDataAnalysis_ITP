 High Hurstwood Fete.                  
 High Hurstwood Fete was held on       
 Saturday June 29 th 1985 to raise     
 money for the Church. There was dog   
 show and an obedience show. There was 
 a tombola and a treasure hunt, but    
 there was not a tug of war team as    
 last year.                            
 The Flower Festival at St Margaret the
 Queen.                                
 Last week class one girls of Buxted   
 School arranged flowers for the       
 festival at the Church. On Friday we  
 went up to the Church for a short     
 service. Afterwards a reporter from   
 the Sussex Express asked Mr Manners if
 he could take a photo of us. The      
 festival had a theme of peace.
