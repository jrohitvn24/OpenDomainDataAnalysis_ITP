		<title>02  SALTWOOD VILLAGE.</title>
		<content>         Saltwood is by far the largest
 dwelling area of the block.Parts of it
 are mentioned in the Domesday Book.The
 castle,in the next block,is a possible
 site of a Saxon fortress dating from  
 C400.The register of the parish church
 of S.S.Peter &amp; Paul dates from C14.   
        It is a pleasant,picturesque   
 village originally built around the   
 present village green but now expanded
 into a much wider area of expensive   
 housing.                              
         There is a regular bus service
 and it is close to the railway-station
 and the motorway.                     
         The amenities and facilities  
 are good.It has a garage,a pub"The    
 Castle",a Post-Office,two General     
 Stores,a butchers and a hairdressers.
