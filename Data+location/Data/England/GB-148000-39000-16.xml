		<title>16HOLIDAY JOBS IN ST.IVES.</title>
		<content>  We wanted to find out how many pupils
 in the comprehensive school had       
{part-time}or{seasonal jobs}.We asked  
 each class four questions, a total of 
 five hundred children between 11 &amp; 16.
                                       
  We found that{23%}of those surveyed  
 have a part-time job all year round,  
 while another{25%}have seasonal jobs. 
  Among the people with seasonal jobs  
{64%}work in businesses which close    
 down in the winter.                   
  About a quarter{(24%)}of the children
 questioned said that their parents    
 were involved in the holiday trade.   
                                       
  We found  in our amenity count that  
 including bed and breakfast houses    
 there were over{300 }places to stay   
 in St. Ives. With over{40}restaurants,
 take-aways and  cafes as well, there  
 are plenty of summer jobs.            </content>
