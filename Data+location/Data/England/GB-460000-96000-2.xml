		<title>02A DAY IN THE LIFE OF MARK</title>
		<content>      A usual day for me is to get up  
 at 6.30 and read till seven. Then I   
 would have a cup of tea with my dad.  
 My dad works of the Royal Yacht       
 Brittania. After he has gone I lay in 
 till 7.35 then go downstairs and get  
 the dogs breakfast.  My dog is a      
 Yorkshire Terrier and its name is     
 Samantha and is a nice dog. For       
 breakfast I have Sugar Puffs.  I then 
 go upstairs and have a wash and clean 
 my teeth.  Then I go downstairs and   
 get my bag ready for school. Then I   
 walk my dog.  My friend Stephen calls 
 for me and we go to John's house.     
 School starts at 8.50am, but I go in  
 early to set up the record player for 
 assembly.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
