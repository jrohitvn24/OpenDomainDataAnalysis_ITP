		<content>The {landscape} is dominated by a ridge
of chalk that runs parallel with the   
{Misbourne} valley.The slope,rising    
from the valley floor and the A413,is  
now entirely built up with residential 
property.At the summit,marking the     
residential boundary,is Denham Lane.   
Beyond this,forming a plateau,is the   
{Green Belt} area which then falls away
to the East.The section nearest Denham 
Lane is grazing land,beyond which is a 
line of dense Beechwood.This ground is 
mainly chalk with an overlying layer of
clay,also pockets of gravel which are  
still being excavated.The eastern slope
is put to agricultural use and has     
recently been crossed by the {M25}.The 
main crop is rapeseed.The two oldest   
roads crossing the area are Denham Lane
and Rickmansworth Lane.Apart from a    
couple of farms and cottages,all other 
property has been added since 1940.    </content>
