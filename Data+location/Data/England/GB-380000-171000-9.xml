		<content> This school is for children from the  
 age of five to eleven years. There is 
 one main building and four mobile     
 classrooms, the school is lucky in    
 having spacious grounds and pleasant  
 views.                                
 The school used to be housed in a     
 Victorian building near the church    
 which was used for extra classes until
 1979.                                 
 A group of children talked to some    
 elderly people about school life in   
 the nineteen twenties. In general     
 school  was much stricter, the lessons
 were repetitive and left little room  
 for individual creativity. These days 
 there are more oppurtunities to       
 investigate interesting topics and    
 visit interesting places as a result  
 of which the school day is often more 
 enjoyable.
