		<title>09DAY TO DAY LIFE IN BARSBY 2</title>
		<content>  The lack of bus sevice and shops is a
 disadvantage to some residents        
 particularly if they have no car. Mrs 
 Jesson feels that Barsby is very cut  
 off from the towns and that really to 
 live in Barsby it is necessary to have
 a car.                                
  A facility in Barsby which is vital  
 for the older people is the service   
 vans which come to Barsby on different
 days of the week. There is a butchers,
 bakers, grocers and library van, and a
 milkman who delivers milk everyday. If
 people want to buy goods such as      
 clothes then they usually travel to   
 Leicester or Melton.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
