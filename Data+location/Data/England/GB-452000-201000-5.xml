the season in the top ten;  8 people   
thought it would carry off the League  
Cup.   The Chairman, Robert Maxwell, is

for Oxford United;  only 40% were      
satisfied with the City Council's

Oxford United's need to have a ground  
with much more accommodation for       
spectators is generally acknowledged,

from the Manor.   Opinion as to whether
a new ground should be in Botley or at 
the Peartree roundabout was evenly     
split.   Who were the supporters'      
favourite players?   Aldridge came top
