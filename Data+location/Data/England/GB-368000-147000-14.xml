		<title>14  Coleford Wesley Church</title>
		<content> On the 13th of June a group of        
 children went to the{Coleford Wesley  
{church.}A man met us down there.When  
 we went in the{chapel}I asked him some
 questions and he told me all the      
 answers.     He told us a story about 
 when he went to school.   " A boy came
 back with a bit of a German plane that
 had crashed nearby then all the boys  
 went (in school time! )   to get a bit
 of the plane but a policeman saw them 
 and sent them all back to school where
 they all got something _ {the cane!}" 
    After we had been to the chapel we 
 went to the{parish church.}Sherree    
  and I said we would count the graves 
 we counted fifty graves and got fed up
 and went back in the church and went  
 and looked at the{bell rope.}A man    
 pulled it three times, then we came   
 back to school. I enjoyed the         
 afternoon.                            </content>
