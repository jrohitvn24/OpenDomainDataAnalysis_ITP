		<content> SEARCHES-There are a number of reasons
 for searches, missing children and in 
 bad weather missing hikers are the    
 main ones.The following are used in   
 the search;uniformed officers with    
 local knowledge, dogs, horses and     
 helicopters.If in a really            
 inaccessible area mountain rescue are 
 asked to help.Once the missing person 
 has been found radio for medical back 
 up and organise the transportation of 
 the person if injured.                
 VEHICLES-Because of the nature of the 
 land the police need land rovers to   
 get up onto the moors.In our area one 
 is at Milnrow police station and the  
 other is at Littleborough.If the      
 helicopter is needed this comes from  
 Greater Manchester Headquarters.
