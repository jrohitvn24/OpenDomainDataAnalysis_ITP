		<title>17THE COTTON WOOL MILL</title>
		<content>   There is a cotton wool mill beside  
 the River Caldew at the edge of       
 Buckabank. The first mill was built in
 1793, but this was destroyed by       
 lightning in 1901.                    
   This is one of the few mills in     
 Great Britain that produces pure      
 cotton wool. Its product is used as   
 padding in clothes and coffins, and in
 filters or dust masks, particularly   
 those used by miners.                 
   The mill was water driven until     
 1972: its wheel was one of the biggest
 steel water wheels working in Britain.
 In 1972, the mill was converted to run
 on electricity.                       
   The Mill employs forty-two people,  
 very few when compared with the three 
 hundred people who worked there in the
 Eighteenth Century.
