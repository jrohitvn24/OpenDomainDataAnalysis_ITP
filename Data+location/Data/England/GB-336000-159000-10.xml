		<title>10Traffic in Banwell</title>
		<content>    Nearly every edition of the local  
 weekly paper has an article about     
 Banwell's busy streets.  Several      
 people have been injured or badly     
 shocked by near misses in West Street.
 A by-pass was suggested over 45 years 
 ago and villagers are still           
 campaigning for it!                   
    Hannah and I went down to the hall 
 to count the cars, buses, lorries,    
 vans and motor bikes. Ladies have also
 been counting how many lorries went   
 onto the pavements so that cars going 
 the other way can get by. There are   
 sometimes traffic jams when I am      
 coming to school because the cows or  
 dustbin men are coming along the road.
    The survey conducted by Banwell    
 School amazed everyone when it        
 revealed that, between 8.45am and 3pm,
 16,415 vehicles passed the school in  
 only three days.                      </content>
