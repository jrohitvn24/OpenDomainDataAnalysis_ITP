 The remains of an old railway         
 embankment, in the north east of the  
 block, shows where the Bedford to     
 Hitchin railway line used to run.     
 This railway line was opened in 1857  
 and closed in 1963.  These days over  
 73% of Eastcotts residents have a car 
 although many of them use the local   
 bus service to travel to work or to   
 shop.  There is a thirty minute bus   
 service between Hitchin and Bedford, a
 two hourly bus service from Wilstead  
 and four buses per day between        
 Biggleswade and Bedford.
