 Harrowden Hall was bought by Thomas   
Watson Wentworth,Marquess of           
Rockingham in 1695.The present Hall    
dates from around 1720 and is a Grade  
1 listed building.It is fairly plain   
in appearance and until fairly         
recently belonged to the family of     
Lord Vaux. This Catholic family had    
connections with the Treshams and the  
gunpowder plot.A small Catholic Chapel 
was built in the grounds of the Hall   
in 1905.It is a copy of a chantry      
chapel at Higham Ferrers.              
                                       
 With the exception of the chapel the  
Hall and grounds were bought by the    
Wellingborough Golf Club in 1975.The   
parkland around the Hall now provides  
the setting for an 18 hole 6363 yards  
72 par golf course.
