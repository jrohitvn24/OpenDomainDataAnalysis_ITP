		<title>02Employment in Chilton area.</title>
		<content>   Many people are unemployed in       
 Chilton. Most of those who have jobs  
 travel to nearby towns to work,       
 although a newly developed small      
 industrial estate in Chilton itself   
 is providing more local employment.   
   Thirty or forty years ago nearly all
 the men in Chilton would have been    
 employed in the local coal mines but  
 these have since shut down and there  
 is now little evidence of their       
 existence.                            
   In a survey that we conducted in our
 school we found that Newton Aycliffe, 
 a new town five miles south of        
 Chilton, had most parents, both       
 mothers and fathers, working there in 
 a variety of jobs in the industrial   
 estates. Electrical engineering, lawn-
 mower manufacture and photocopying    
 equipment are included in these       
 occupations.                          </content>
