		<content> The A429 runs along the West side of  
 our area from Cirencester to Stow-in  
 the Wold. It is a major road and a old
 one _ it is the Roman Fosse way going 
 from Bath to Lincoln.                 
    The A433 is the other main road _  
 and again parts of it follow a Roman  
 road _ Akeman street. It goes from    
 Cirencester to Burfard and runs right 
 through the middle of Barnsley        
 village. It is a busy road with a     
 speed limit of 40 mph through the     
 village.                              
    During one hour in August we saw 95
 cars heading towards Cirencester and  
 132 cars going towards Bibury and     
 Burford. About 25 were obviously local
 villagers and there were several farm 
 vehicles using the road. Only 3       
 caravans passed through and one car   
 with a foreign number plate.
