 During the summer months the          
population of this part of the town    
grows because of the tourists, often   
using the ferries to the continent, and
because of the holiday-makers attracted
to the four commercial caravan sites   
and many holiday flats available to    
rent.   There are some travelling      
people associated with the fairground  
and Amusements.                        
 Many of the newer flats on the sea    
front have appealed  to elderly people 
retiring from London and other cities, 
and several of the former hotels and   
Guest Houses have in recent times been 
converted into retirement homes.       
 The local Primary School in Langer    
Road has shrunk from 250 pupils in the 
mid-70's to just over 150 in 1985.
