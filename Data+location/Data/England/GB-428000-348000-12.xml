		<content> At seven o clock I switch my alarm off
 and put my radio on, pull the covers  
 over my head until I hear Mum         
 shouting. I get my dressing gown and  
 go down stairs for my breakfast.      
 After eating I wash and get dressed.By
 this time Mum is ready to leave.      
 Richard my brother has to catch       
 the school bus. This leaves Dad and me
 Dad shuts Lady our dog in the kitchen 
 and we go up to Lisas to wait for     
 school time. Our house is now empty   
 except for Lady. At eight forty five  
 Lisa and I go to school until three   
 forty five. I walk home I am often    
 first home I let Lady out. Mum and    
 Richard get home together Dad gets    
 home at five thirty when we have tea  
 at about eight o clock I watch        
 telivision till about nine o clock bed
 time.
