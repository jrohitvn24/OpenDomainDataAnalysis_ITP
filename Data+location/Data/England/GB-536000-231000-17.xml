		<title>17LIVE STYLE IN WYDDIAL</title>
		<content>  This is an area with no real social  
 cohesion. The outlying groups of      
 houses are all on the edge of larger  
 communties to which they look. Wyddial
 village has no shop, no school, no    
 public house.                         
  As an ecclesiastical parish it is now
 part of Hormead where the vicar lives.
 There is usually a Sunday morning     
 service in the church but there is no 
 other community activity of any sort. 
  Children are taken out of the village
 to school and some go to boarding     
 school.                               
  Each week milk is delivered twice    
 weekly from Buntingford. A general    
 shop at Buckland deliveries groceries 
 and frozen meat weekly and will       
 deliver pensions. A mobile library    
 comes fortnightly. All other shopping 
 and any social activity must be       
 elsewhere.                            </content>
