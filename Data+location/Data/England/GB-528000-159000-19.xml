		<title>19My Home in Coulsdon</title>
		<content>   I live in a small, terraced house in
 Coulsdon. We have three smallish      
 bedrooms. The largest bedroom belongs 
 to my mum and dad, the next belongs to
 me and my sister, and the smallest is 
 my brothers. He is 18, so he has a    
 bedroom to himself.                   
   We have one television, a black and 
 white portable which my mum keeps in  
 her wardrobe. We hardly ever watch it 
 anyway.                               
   Our kitchen is so small that only   
 one person can go in there at a time. 
 We eat our meals in our front room,   
 which is our dining room as well.     
   Our house is on an estate of about  
 60 houses, nearly all the same.       
   The garden is only about the size of
 the biggest bedroom (rather small!).
