		<content> Elastics is a very simple game and is 
 usually played outside by any number  
 of people. It is a game played with a 
 long piece of elastic with the ends   
 tied together. Two people then get    
 into the elasic loop and stretch it   
 until it becomes quite tight. The     
 other players then take it in turns to
 jump either into the loop or onto the 
 elastic. There are three main stages  
 in the game, which are ankles, knees  
 and thighs. First you put it round    
 your ankles and then players jump to  
 rhymes. We follow this throughout the 
 game, moving the elastic up our body. 
 We enjoy this game and it gives us    
 something to do at playtimes. At      
 playtime, our school yard is full of  
 people playing elastics. It is the    
 girls' favourite game in our school.  
 Another name for the game is French   
 Skipping.                             </content>
