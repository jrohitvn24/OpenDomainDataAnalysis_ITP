		<content>{Mrs Dark}went to school at{Probus}and 
 she thinks that the main thing they   
 were fussy about while she was there  
 was handwriting .Mrs Dark thinks      
 that{discipline}was harder when she   
 was young.She got a rap across the    
 knuckles with a ruler if she was      
 bad.Mrs Dark played netball at school.
 Mrs Dark doesnt think games have      
 changed much over the years .When Mrs 
 Dark went to school they had desks    
 with{inkwells.}                       
{The Police Station}was at{Rose Cottage
{but it moved to}Trevolgus.There is a  
 room in Rose Cottage that was used as 
 a jail and the policemen lived        
 upstairs.There is a room where        
 criminals would meet their relations. 
{Mrs Darks clothes}changed with fashion
 but she couldn't wear jeans because   
 there was no blue denim.
