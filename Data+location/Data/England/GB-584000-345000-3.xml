		<title>03GUN HILL - BURNHAM OVERY</title>
		<content> Gun Hill is the only labelled feature 
 of land in the immediate vicinity. It 
 is a large sand dune on the line of   
 sand dunes along the coast. Maps      
 indicate that the Hill is on the East 
 point of the Harbour entrance, but in 
 1985 it is about 100 metres to the    
 East.  There exist photographs to show
 that the Hill, made of loose sand, has
 moved Eastwards under the action of   
 the strong North-Westerly winds over  
 the years, although there have been   
 recent attempts to stabilise it.      
 The Hill appears to owe its name to   
 the suggestion that a Gun was mounted 
 here to protect the Harbour Entrance. 
 The dunes in the area are almost      
 totally clear now although in the     
 1920's and 30's many chalets and huts 
 housed a summer community, serviced by
 ferries from Overy Staithe.
