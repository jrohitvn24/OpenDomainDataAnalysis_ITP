		<content> A significant number of women are     
 employed at a turkey meat processing  
 plant (Matthews Norfolk Turkeys)      
 nearby.   Casual, seasonal employment 
 is also availably during the summer   
 months, in the form of fruit picking. 
                                       
    The area as a whole is primarily   
 one of rich farmland, concentrating on
 the production of wheat, barley and   
 sugar beet.                           
                                       
    The public house near the village  
 green, the Papermakers, derives its   
 name from the existence, in historical
 times, of a paper mill which stood    
 beside the River Wensum.   The  other 
 pub, the Angel, boasts connections    
 with Abraham Lincoln.   It was here   
 that his grandparents lived before    
 emigrating to America.
