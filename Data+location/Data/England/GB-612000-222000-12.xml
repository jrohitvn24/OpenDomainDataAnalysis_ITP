		<content>   We spoke to a lady in the village of
 Weeley.  She had been living in the   
 same house in Weeley for 7\ years and 
 preferred it to her previous home in  
 Chelmsford.  She liked to eat crisp   
 sandwiches and fish and chips.  She   
 liked to watch Documentaries on T.V.  
 She thinks that the Prime Minister,   
 Margaret Thatcher is doing good in    
 Britain.  She also thinks that the    
 prices in the village shops are high  
 and so she does her main shopping in  
 Colchester or Clacton.                
   Her hobbies include sewing, knitting
 and cooking.  She has two daughters   
 and a son; they are all married and   
 she is a Grandmother.  She also likes 
 going for walks, but dislikes rain and
 snowy weather.                        
   She likes Weeley and does not think 
 there should be any changes made in   
 the village.                          </content>
