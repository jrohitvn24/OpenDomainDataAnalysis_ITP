		<content>                                       
A typical day for me starts at 6.45.My 
husband is always the first out of bed 
he goes downstairs and makes a pot of  
tea whilst I try and rouse my two      
children.After we have all got dreesed 
we go downstairs and have breakfast.I  
am a teacher,my children leave for     
school with me.My day at work begins at
work with the register and finding out 
who will be staying for dinner.I spend 
my day with a class of 9 and 10 year   
olds, we do a variety of things. Louise
l tell you what we do. We do different 
work each day such as Maths, English,  
Handwriting, and Art and               
Craft,Geography,Science and a project  
which we choose ourselves.On some      
afternoons we can choose what we want  
to do.On Monday,Wednesday and Friday we
have games,in the summer we have       
rounders on the field.                 </content>
