		<title>05RELIGION IN POULTON</title>
		<content>           Religion plays a major role 
 in the lives of many people in        
 Poulton. There are four churches in   
 Poulton;the largest and oldest is St. 
 Chad's (C of E) which dates back to   
 the 17th century. We also have a more 
 modern Methodist church, built in 1965
 which can seat 350 people. Opposite   
 the Methodist church is the United    
 Reformed Church and Congregational    
 Chapel. The old church building is now
 used as a church hall. The Chapel     
 seats over 200 people. The other      
 church is the Catholic Church of      
 English Martyrs on Highcross Road     
 which holds three Sunday services and 
 confessionals. All three Poulton      
 churches have Men's societies, play   
 schools and Sunday Schools. St. Chad's
 also has a bellringing team, which is 
 much in demand for weddings.
