		<title>16Housing.</title>
		<content> Much of the housing is generally old, 
 especially the farm buildings,cottages
 included in our grid and a portion of 
 the centre of the village.Many of the 
 houses were constructed in the last   
 century and consist mainly of stone   
 blocks,with slate roofs.              
   The oldest building in the village  
 is{"The Old Forge",}occupied by {Mr.  
{and Mrs.R.Southall.}This being        
 originally established in the         
 fourteenth century.                   
   Many new brick bungalows are being  
 constructed and the limits of the     
 village constantly expand.Also there  
 is evidence of derelict property being
 rebuilt and used as retirement or     
 holiday accommodation.Recently there  
 has been an influx of towns' people   
 seeking retirement or retreat to the  
 rural areas.Consequently old property 
 values have become inflated.          </content>
