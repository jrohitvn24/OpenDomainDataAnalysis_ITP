 The project for this man made lake was
 started in 1950 and officially opened 
 in 1956 by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth
 Over 1200 acres of farm land were     
 flooded and Denny Island was formed.  
 Over nine farms were covered by the   
 combined waters of the dammed River   
 Chew and tributaries.Some farms are   
 remembered by such names as Moreton   
 Point and Denny Island. Stratford Bay 
 is named after a mill now removed to  
 Blaise Castle,Bristol. Roman Shallows 
 hide a Roman Road and Villa site.     
 Nunnery Point is near the foundations 
 of the Nunnery of St.Cross.Excavations
 uncovered many artifacts now in       
 Bristol Museum.The Lake's capacity is 
 4,500 million gallons.10 million      
 gallons feed daily to Bristol,Bath and
 Barrow Tanks.A conduit takes the over-
 flow back to the River Chew.          </content>
