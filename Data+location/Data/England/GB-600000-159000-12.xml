		<title>12  WOODSIDE PARK ESTATE</title>
		<content>  Opposite Bysingwood school used to   
be a field where horses ran.Last year  
it was sold to Barratts housing and    
they began to build houses using their 
timber-frame construction method.      
Following a T.V. programme that        
suggested that this type of house      
suffered from condensation as the      
building dries out,they found that they
could not sell the houses and phase 2  
was postponed.Barratts,Britain's       
largest builders have now called a halt
to this multi-million pound development
and sold out to a Kent building firm.  
They are planing a new site in         
Maidstone using the more traditional   
building methods.Barratts maintain that
Faversham is ideally situated for a    
housing developement of the size and   
type originally planned for Woodside   
park and plan to build similar houses  
in Scotland.                           </content>
