		<content>The local {Anglican} church has a      
regular worshipping congregation of    
about 250 adults and 200 children.We   
carried out a survey of church         
attendance and found that 15% of our   
pupils(11-18) attended church;only 3%  
attend weekly.Twice as many mothers    
(12%) attended church as fathers;twice 
as many sisters (8%) as brothers.      
A {Sikh} female comments on her move   
from multi-racial Wolverhampton to     
here -"I experienced racism before but 
this was nothing to what I was to      
find.The mind- less minority made my   
life a miseery. After only 2 months    
the underlying current of racism came  
to a head.I was beaten up by 5         
mindless racist thugs. This was not an 
isolated incident and I suffered 2     
years of verbal attacks before I could 
persuade the police to do anything".
