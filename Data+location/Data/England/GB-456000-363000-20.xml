		<title>20How we did this survey</title>
		<content>  The survey was a shared activity     
 between two Primary Schools.          
 Samuel Barlow being the larger of the 
 two schools we undertook to cover     
 2/3rds of the land cover and 3/4 of   
 the text.  Within our school we did   
 our survey in small groups. Typically 
 a teacher and a group of about 6      
 children went out. The teacher being  
 relieved of their normal teaching load
 by usually the headteacher taking the 
 rest of the class.                    
  This was further complicated by the  
 teachers in the National Union of     
 Teachers and the National Association 
 of Schoolmasters/mistresses being on  
 industrial action and not covering for
 absent colleagues as usual or working 
 through their lunchbreak.             
  The children wrote most of the text  
 but it had to be edited by teachers.  
 We thoroughly enjoyed the process.    </content>
