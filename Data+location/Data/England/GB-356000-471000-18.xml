		<title>18Changes in Melling - Part 1</title>
		<content>   Twenty years since 1965 have seen   
many changes in the way of life and    
work in Melling.                       
   Five working farms have reduced to  
two; three farm houses are now private 
houses; two barns have been converted  
to four dwellings; with two more pro-  
posed; two farm cottages are now let;  
and a total of ninteen new houses have 
been built. The sale of land from the  
three farms has resulted in random     
ownership of fields in the valley      
and on the hillside, now used as       
out-fields for stock-rearing. On       
only one farm is a younger generation  
involved in the day-to-day work.       
   Population changes have seen an     
increase in pensioners (mostly widows) 
and an influx of staff from the        
University and local industry or com-  
merce,though this has now slowed,due   
to cut-backs and closures.&lt;Continued.. </content>
