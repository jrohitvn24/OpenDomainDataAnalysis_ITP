		<title>06THE RECTORY &amp; COACH HOUSE</title>
		<content>   The Rectory was built in 1846.      
 Before that, the Rectory used to be at
 5, Glebelands, opposite the church.   
 The last Rector to live in the        
 Rectory, until 1971, was Rev. Garlick.
 Before the school was opened an       
 earlier Rector, Rev. Redford, used to 
 teach children in the Rectory.        
                                       
   The Coach House was once a part of  
 the Rectory's drive. There is a       
 saying that at night a carriage with  
 six white horses goes up and down the 
 drive once. A man steps out and walks 
 through a wall where it is believed   
 that a door used to be. The coach then
 just disappears into thin air.        
                                       
   The people who now live in the Coach
 House have heard footsteps like       
 children's going up and down stairs.
