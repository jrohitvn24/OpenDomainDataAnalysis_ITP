 In this sparsely populated area there 
 are very few events of note, and no   
 traditional festivals. Even the       
 village bonfire failed to take place  
 last year. Asby has a wooden          
 "Clubroom" which hosts such events as 
 dances, wine-and-cheese evenings,     
 bring-and-buy sales,Christmas parties 
 and very occasional concerts. The     
 village school puts on concerts and   
 plays, and sometimes a barbeque or    
 garden party is held in what was the  
 vicarage. Organisations in the area   
 include the Womens Institute, Mothers'
 Union and Young Farmers Club,which    
 organise events, but these are usually
 held in Appleby.Motor sport is popular
 in this region and several motor clubs
 use the narrow roads and tracks for   
 their rallies.
