		<content> Our area is noted for its farms,but   
 as farmers get bigger and better      
 machines they are employing fewer and 
 fewer people.                         
 British Rail in Crewe employs a lot of
 people still, and so does Rolls Royce,
 but these places can not be relied on 
 to provide us with jobs for when we   
 leave school.                         
 Our local Borough is trying to        
 encourage tourism as an industry.We   
 live in an interesting area and we    
 hope that people will come and see the
 places that we have described.
