		<title>04Views from Rawdon School</title>
		<content>  Class 5 looked at the immediate      
 surroundings of Rawdon C.E.School.    
  To the North is the Billing which is 
 230m above sea level.The Billing is a 
 local beauty spot and a favourite     
 walk.Near the bottom of the Billing is
 a dam well stocked with fish.         
  To the South is Rawdon Town Street on
 which is a Post Office and several    
 shops.Beyond Town Street we can see   
 across the valley.On a clear day Emley
 Moor T.V. mast can be seen.           
  To the East is our school playing    
 field,with more fields beyond.The     
 Church Tower and clock are visible    
 above the trees.Behind the fields     
 planes land and take off from Leeds   
 and Bradford Airport.                 
  To the West is Billingwood Drive and 
 Billing View,houses for the elderly.  
 Beyond is Rawdon Cricket Club and     
 Rawdon Old Boys football field.       </content>
