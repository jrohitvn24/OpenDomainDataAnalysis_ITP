Recently, a search for oil began in    
the local district.North Sea           
Petroleums Ltd are using a lorry       
carrying equipment to search for oil   
along a planned route of roads, by     
vibrating the road surface.            
 The vitroseismic surveys are being    
carried out along the road from        
Harpsden to Crowsley Park and up to    
Sonning Common, back to Shiplake Row,  
and from there to Playhatch and        
Charvil.                               
 If the company, a subsidiary of Attock
Petroleum, finds there is evidence     
pointing to gas or oil in the area,    
they will have to get a production     
licience.                              
 Even if oil is found, it is unlikely  
that the area will become another Texas
- drilling equipment is said to be less
obtrusive than the average farm silo.  </content>
