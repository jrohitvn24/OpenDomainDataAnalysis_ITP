		<content>                                       
   Plaish is small hamlet about 12     
 miles from the nearest market town,   
 Shrewsbury.The main industry in the   
 area is agriculture.The type of       
 farming practised is mixed, Dairy,    
 livestock and some arable.During the  
 early summer,silage and hay are made, 
 to be followed by the harvesting of   
 the corn with a combine-harvester.    
 The straw is baled into quite large   
 round bales weighing about 400kg.each.
 The grain_wheat,oats &amp; barley,is dried
 and stored in silos of about 50 tonnes
 capacity. After the harvest,the fields
 are ploughed,cultivated and resown    
 with crops for the following year.    
 Pedigree Hereford cattle are bred at  
 one farm.A great deal of work goes    
 into rearing and preparing young bulls
 for sale as Herd Sires,mainly for the 
 Dairy herds.                          </content>
