		<title>16YOUNG SCIENTISTS AT IBSTOCK</title>
		<content>   {Ibstock Junior School}responded    
 well to the Government's wishes for   
 more science in schools by winning a  
 county-wide science competition.      
    The contest was designed to        
 stimulate the interest of youngsters  
 in science and to see what sort of    
 work was going on in Leicestershire   
 schools.                              
    The Ibstock children embarked on a 
 project about the structure of the    
 earth, minerals, rocks, fossils       
 and soil.                             
    Part of the work was to set up     
 simple experiments to show how        
 different rock formations came into   
 being.                                
    The work took half a term to       
 complete and the Ibstock display at   
 the county competition won Â£100 worth 
 of science equipment for the school.
