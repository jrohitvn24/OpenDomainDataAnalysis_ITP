 A large area of this block is covered 
 by {privately owned parkland}         
 surrounding{CORNBURY  HOUSE .}Most    
 ofthe remainder is the ancient {FOREST
{OF WYCHWOOD.}The village of {Finstock 
 lies   on the S.E. corner,and the     
 small market town of {Charlbury}      
 borders the N.E. corner.              
    {William I }took possession of     
{Wychwood Forest }in {1086, }and       
 Rainald was the keeper,paying Â£10     
 a year to the king. It remained a {   
{Royal Hunting Forest}and valuable     
 source of {timber}until the {Act of   
{Enclosure}in 1857,when it passed to   
 the {owner}of {Cornbury Park.}About   
 two_thirds of the forest was cut      
 down at that time.
