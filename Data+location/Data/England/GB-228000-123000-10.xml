		<content> Local History  Clovelly to 1900.      
{Clovelly Dykes,}marked with rings of  
 banks and dykes, dates from the Iron  
 Age. No evidence of permanent         
 settlement has yet been found.  The   
{Roman}name for Clovelly was Clausa    
 Vallis, or closed valley.  The{Saxon} 
 name for Clovelly was Cleave Leigh, or
 wooded cleft.  Clovelly is recorded in
 the 1086 Domesday Survey.  The{Parish 
{Church}of All Saints dates from the   
 Norman Period and was later extended  
 in the Perpendicular period.  The     
 church is quite rich in monuments,    
 many connected with the Lords of the  
 Manor.  The original and remaining    
 wing of{Clovelly Court}possibly dates 
 from the 14th Century.  The{quay}and  
 the present village houses of cob and 
 stone with slate roofs date from the  
 16th Century.
