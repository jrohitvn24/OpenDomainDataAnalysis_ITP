		<content>     In eight out of ten{Merton}homes{ 
  some form of private transport is    
 available.This is an important        
 consideration,not only because of     
 employment,but also because of the    
 absence from the village of many basic
 amenities such as a Doctor's Surgery. 
                                       
     For those without transport buses 
 pass through {Merton}daily en route to
 nearby towns.Local coach proprietors  
 such as{Agrimotors}also provide       
 regular trips to cities like Plymouth 
 and Exeter.About 60% of the children  
 at {The Clinton School}come by coach. 
                                       
    The local railway line between     
 Torrington and Halwill Junction was   
 closed to passengers in the late 60's.
 Not surprisingly only 20% of local    
 people have travelled by train in the 
 last year.                            </content>
