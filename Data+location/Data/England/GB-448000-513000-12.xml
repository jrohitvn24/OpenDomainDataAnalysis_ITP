		<title>12The Recreation Centre</title>
		<content>  In the Recreation centre you can play
 games or do cookery or other things.  
 In the summer they have a treasure    
 hunt where the helpers give you a     
 piece of paper and on it you write a  
 word. We wrote  PLAYSCHEME. You had to
 find the letters and say where you    
 found them.                           
  The helpers take the little ones to  
 the park sometimes. At the recreation 
 centre there is a tennis court and a  
 bowling green.  Sometimes they take   
 you out to play football on the grass.
                                       
 In the recreation centre there is a   
 table tennis table.  Sometimes they   
 have a table tennis contest to see who
 is the best player. There is a        
 practice on a Wednesday night from    
 7.30 till 8.
