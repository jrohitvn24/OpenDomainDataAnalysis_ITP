		<title>11HOME LIFE 2.</title>
		<content>   During the past 6 years the Standard
of Living has been forced down.        
   Food tends to be basic - bread,     
cereal, potato (usually chips), and    
egg or sausage or burgers or beans.    
Little fresh meat is bought and poultry
has replaced the Sunday joint.         
   Recreation centres round the TV and 
most homes have a video.               
   Family Â£outings' revolve round:- the
weekly shopping, visits to the Seasonal
"Fairs" held in the schools and halls, 
or to Beacon Park.                     
   Special Â£outings' centre round      
soccer, the local club, or the local   
dances held in the schools or community
Centres.                               
   Very few people are able to afford a
holiday away from home so day trips are
again in vogue.                        
   Many children never leave the area  
except for School Visits.              </content>
