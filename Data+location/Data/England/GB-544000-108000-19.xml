		<title>19THE GARDENS OF GLYNDEBOURNE</title>
		<content> Some of us were in a production at    
 Glyndebourne and when we were not     
 working we would walk into the car    
 park and look at some of the cars.    
 Then we might go to the lake and look 
 at the fish such as pike and bream. We
 would go into the gardens. They are   
 divided into rooms. The walls are     
 hedges. We would look at the urn and  
 all the flowers. On the far side there
 is a wood where we could play hide and
 seek. There's a wendy house in the    
 wood and a ha-ha which keeps the sheep
 and cows from getting up onto the lawn
 and trampling the flowers. One day we 
 found an old champagne cork. Some days
 we used to play cricket and have our  
 bacon sandwiches and icecream like the
 audience who picnic on the lawns      
 during the intervals.
