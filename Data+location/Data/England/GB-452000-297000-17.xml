		<title>17MY DAY</title>
		<content>    In the morning my radio wakes me   
 up .I get dressed and go downstairs to
 have my breakfast. I have cornflakes  
 and fruit juice. Then I go upstairs to
 comb my hair and clean my teeth.When  
 I have my shoes and coat on,my mum,my 
 sister and I get in the car. We drive 
 to school.                            
    I walk into the playground.If it is
 ten to nine I go into the cloakroom   
 where I change my shoes. I take my    
 things out of my bag and take my coat 
 off,then I go into the classroom and  
 sit in my chair to listen  for the    
 register. Then its time for assembly. 
    When we come out we sit on the     
 carpet and listen to what we have to  
 do. It is usually maths or English.   
 After about an hour we go outside to  
 play. When we come back in we swap    
 subjects, then before dinner we go to 
 wash our hands. (cont.P18)            </content>
