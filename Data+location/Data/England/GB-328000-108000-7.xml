		<title>07Farming Around Chard</title>
		<content>{Farms}have changed greatly in the past
 10 years due to the larger acreage of 
{cereals} grown,the ravages of{Dutch}  
{Elm Disease},improvement of access for
 milk tankers when churn traffic ceased
 and the general reduction of farm     
 labour. The latter has resulted in    
 many farm cottages being sold to      
 private owners who are retired or work
 in nearby towns.                      
 Productivity has been improved by the 
 use of powerful tractors with power   
 take_off allowing one_man operation.  
 There are{markets}in Taunton,Axminster
 and Ilminster where bullocks are sold 
 to the local abbatoirs for slaughter. 
 At nearby{Pudleigh}there is a trout   
 farm where fish are reared in a series
 of ponds to eatable size.             
 Many farms let property for holidays  
 and some are registered{camp sites}   
 charging up to Â£1/person/night.       </content>
