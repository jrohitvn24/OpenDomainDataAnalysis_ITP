		<content> In Leintwardine bright colours and    
 pale coloured clothes are very        
 popular with the young and old. Old   
 people usually make their own clothes 
 instead of buying them, but if they do
 buy them, they buy them from Hereford 
 or Leominster.Old people don't like   
 wearing make-up but will wear a bit   
 when they go out.The young wear a lot.
 When we asked whether they liked tight
 clothes or baggy clothes they said    
 baggy clothes because you have to be  
 very thin to wear tight clothes.Most  
 people don't really like punk         
 hair-styles but said it was up to the 
 people who have them.Old people said  
 that they liked casual styles best,but
 the young didn't really mind.Most     
 people went to the local hair-dresser,
 Angelique Beddoes, to have their hair 
 done.
