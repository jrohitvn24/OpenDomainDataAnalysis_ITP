		<content> The river Wallington is about 3 metres
 wide and 50 cm deep,it flows quite    
 fast.On the banks there are white     
 nettles and cow parsley.The landscape 
 is flat.The Meon is in a valley which 
  in the west, is quite steep sided,but
 in the east is a flat flood plain with
 poor,rough pasture used only for      
 horses.It is wider and deeper than the
 Wallington,it is about 6 metres       
 wide and 1 metre 50 cm deep.The       
 water is used in the sewage farm which
 serves Wickham village.The water is   
 clear as the river carries little     
 sediment.Local residents walk beside  
 the river for recreation,and there    
 is some coarse fishing.
