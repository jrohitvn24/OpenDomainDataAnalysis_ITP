		<title>10Housing in Brompton on Swale</title>
		<content> Most of the houses in Brompton are    
 built of brick but some of the old    
 ones are stone. Usually these are two-
 storied but there are some bungalows  
 for old people.                       
 Most houses have central heating and  
 a lot of them have open fires. There  
 are about two to four bedrooms in the 
 houses and the older houses are a bit 
 bigger than the new ones. The new     
 houses mostly have garages but the old
 ones only have drives. Most houses    
 have gardens, some of them are quite  
 big.                                  
 The older houses are along the main   
 road in the village but the newer     
 houses are in 5 estates. There are    
 more houses being built near the      
 school and the village is getting     
 bigger.                               
 There are a lot of council houses in  
 Colburn but not many in Brompton.     </content>
