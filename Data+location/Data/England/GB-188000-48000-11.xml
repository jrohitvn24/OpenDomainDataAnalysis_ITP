		<title>11Ladock Parish Hall</title>
		<content>  The Parish hall,a wooden building,was
 a ward at St.Clements hospital in the 
 first world war. In 1926 Canon Flint  
 bought the building and it was moved  
 to church land by the river. Every    
 Wednesday morning there is a painting 
 class,Wednesday evening is Mrs.       
 Sperry's dog training class. Friday   
 night is Youth Club.Every 2nd Thursday
 in the month the Women's Institute    
 have their meetings. Birthday parties,
 weddings or discos are at weekends.   
 All the village societies hold Autumn 
 and Spring fairs in the hall. In the  
 summer the school has a carwash. The  
 Parish Council holds their meetings in
 the hall and it is a polling station  
 at elections. Once the Duke of        
 Gloucester visited the Youth Club and 
 once Bill Owen came. At the Queen's   
 Silver Jubilee we had a village party 
 and the children  were given cups.    </content>
