		<content> This area is quite a contrast .For the
 most part it is sparsely populated.{  
{WINGFIELD}has been about the same size
 for the last 200 years. There are 260 
 adults on the electoral roll. There   
 are several reasons for this :        
 distance to work, housing cost . The  
{green belt}area includes Wingfield and
 planning permission is difficult to   
 obtain. Only two houses have been     
 built in the village recently; one on 
 the site of a tin chapel and the other
 in a large garden. The latter required
 permission from {London}. On the edge 
 of our squares is the boundary of a   
 large {Council Estate}in Trowbridge.  
 Few houses are visible from the main  
 road in Wingfield , most of the Lanes 
 are dead ends  .{LOVE'S LANE}is named 
 after a family who lived there.       
 Pomeroy comes from the saxon Pumerig. 
{Shop Lane}has never had a shop.       </content>
