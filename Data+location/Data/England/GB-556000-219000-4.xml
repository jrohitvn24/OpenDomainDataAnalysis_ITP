		<title>04TAKELEY, THE PEOPLE</title>
		<content> Over the past fifty years, there has  
 been a great change in the composition
 of the population of Takeley and the  
 surrounding villages.  This has had a 
 great effect on the villagers'        
 occupations and place of work.  In the
 past most of the people worked in     
 agriculture or local service, both    
 domestic and commercial.  Therefore   
 they lived and worked within the      
 community.  Now the majority of people
 work outside the village, either in   
 surrounding towns such as Bishops     
 Stortford and Harlow, or further      
 afield in the City of London.  People 
 commute from the village daily either 
 by car, train or coach.  The arrival  
 of London's third airport at Stansted 
 may again change the whole pattern of 
 the population and place of work.This 
 may once again produce a community    
 where people both live and work.      </content>
