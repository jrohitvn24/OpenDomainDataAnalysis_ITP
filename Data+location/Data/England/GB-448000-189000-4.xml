		<title>04THE POWER STATION</title>
		<content> THE POWER STATION IS ONE OF THE       
 LARGEST OF ITS KIND IN EUROPE.IT IS A 
 COAL FIRED STATION WITH 6 COOLING     
 TOWERS.ORIGINALLY THE STATION HAD     
 DIFFICULTY FINDING STAFF.MANY PEOPLE  
 MOVED FROM THE NORTH INCLDUING        
 NEWCASTLE, FIRSTLY LODGING IN HOSTELS 
 AND FINALLY SETTLING IN DIDCOT -SO NOW
 THE WHOLE WORKFORCE IS LOCAL.WORKING  
 CONDITIONS ARE GOOD AND ARE CHECKED BY
 SAFETY REGULATIONS.THERE IS A PAY     
 ALLOWANCE FOR WORKING IN SOME         
 DIFFICULT CONDITIONS.POLLUTION HAS    
 CAUSED MUCH CONCERN AND MANY TESTS ARE
 NOW BEING CARRIED OUT FOR ACID        
 RAIN.TRACES OF LEGIONAIRES'DISEASE    
 HAVE BEEN FOUND,BUT ARE HARMLESS.THE  
 POWER STATION'S FUTURE WILL BE DECIDED
 SOON.IT WAS FULLY OPENED IN 1970 AND  
 IS DUE FOR RENEWAL IN 1995.ONCE THE   
 THERMAL EFFICIENCY DETERIORATES A NEW 
 STATION WILL BE NEEDED.(M.MCNULTY)    </content>
