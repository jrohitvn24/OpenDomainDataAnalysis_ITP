		<content>    A great concern of the l980's      
 is vandalism many causes are given -  
 unemployment, boredom, lack of        
 parental discipline.                  
    This Spring the Community Centre   
 was so badly vandalised that it had to
 be demolished - leaving a block of    
 badly damaged garages full of rubbish 
 and broken glass.                     
    Previously the centre had been used
 for many private and public functions.
 Now the only social amenity left to   
 improve the quality of life in this   
 area is the church which runs youth   
 clubs, bingo sessions and evenings    
 for the handicapped.                  
    There is a strong feeling locally  
 about the inadequacies and there have 
 been public meetings to discuss the   
 problems and to set up a Good         
 Neighbour scheme.
