		<title>04 CANALS OF WEEDON BEC</title>
		<content>  The {Grand Union Canal} was opened as
far as Weedon in 1796 as the {Grand    
Junction Canal}.However Blisworth      
tunnel was not completed until March   
1805.                                  
   The canal enters Weedon near "The   
Narrowboat" public house on {Watling   
Street}.It goes under bridges 26 and 25
and then crosses Church Street,the     
{River Nene} and Bridge Street on      
aqueducts.                             
   Part of the canal used to go into   
the {Royal Military Depot} and was used
to deliver men and materials.Boats had 
to navigate a lifting bridge on the    
{London &amp; Birmingham Railway}.         
   The canal leaves Weedon soon after  
bridge 23.                             
   There are two pleasure boatyards in 
Weedon,Concoform Marine and Waterways  
Holidays.                              
                                       </content>
