		<title>19FARM AND RESERVOIR</title>
		<content>Great Eaves farm, covering eighty-five 
acres is about three kilometres from   
Hanley's centre, on the edge of        
Bucknall and indeed the city boundary. 
The farming family have held the       
tenancy from Staffordshire County      
Council for thirty seven years.The     
stock in June 1985 included fifty beef 
cattle,sixteen calves and about four   
hundred sheep.These are sent to market 
either at Uttoxeter or Newcastle.      
Part of one of the fields is fenced off
by the Severn Trent Water Authority.Two
tanks holding over nine thousand cubic 
metres of water were constructed there 
in 1959.This covered reservoir supplies
water to the Bentilee housing estate   
and most of Abbey Hulton.              
From the reservoir one has a sweeping  
panoramic view across Bucknall to the  
tower blocks of Hanley on the horizon.
