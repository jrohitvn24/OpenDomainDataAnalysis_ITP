 I get up at 8:00 when my mum wakes me.
 I finish breakfast by 8:30 and brush  
 my hair. I help pack my sandwiches for
 lunch. I leave for school at 9:00 and 
 arrive a few minutes later. Some of us
 go inside to do jobs but the rest of  
 us stay out in the playground until   
 the bell goes. When it does we stand  
 still and wait until our class is     
 called in then we unstack our chairs  
 and read until the register is taken  
 then we go into assembly. After       
 assembly we go back to class and get  
 on with our target work. Target work  
 consists of  two pieces of language   
 and two maths cards. At 10:30 we have 
 play. In the summer we go on the field
 and we are allowed to play football   
 and rounders. After play we carry on  
 with our target work until lunch at   
 12:15.               /cont page 19    </content>
