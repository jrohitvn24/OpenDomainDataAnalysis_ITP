		<title>06Arrow Mill</title>
		<content> There has been a mill on the Arrow    
 since the first Domesday in 1066. Then
 it was worth 6s.8p.                   
       The present Mill stopped working
 in 1962 when the buildings were bought
 and changed into a restaurant.All the 
 workings were removed.                
       Today the restaurant is very    
 prosperous,standing in its own grounds
 and approached from the A435 down a   
 long drive.The workings from another  
 mill function here now and you can sit
 and eat looking over the mill pond    
 watching the wheel go round.          
       The present tenants Mr and Mrs  
 Woodhams are changing the upstairs    
 into accomodation and by this summer  
 there will be fifteen bedrooms. A     
 small farmyard of animals is centred  
 around the old stables which once     
 housed the horses and carts.The Arrow 
 Mill is a very popular eating place.  </content>
