		<content> The old people living this area can be
 divided into two categories -those who
 have lived all their lives in the     
 area, rarely moving outside its       
 boundaries; the others being people   
 who have moved into the area,         
 commuting and then retiring.          
 One of the old locals had this to say 
 about his life.  He was born in the   
 house in which he still lives - his   
 parents and grandparents having lived 
 there before him.  One of seven       
 children, living in four rooms (it has
 since been extended) with oil lamps   
 until l950, outside toilet and no     
 running water until l95l.   Before    
 this "we went to the spring for       
 water".  He now has a bathroom and    
 inside toilet.  He remembers seeing   
 his first aeroplane and the first bus 
 in the area in l936.  He clearly      
 remembers seeing horse drawn ploughs  </content>
