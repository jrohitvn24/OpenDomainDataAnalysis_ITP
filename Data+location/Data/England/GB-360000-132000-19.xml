		<content> Castle Cary Primary School in 1984/85 
 has a teaching staff of 5 full-time   
 and 1 part-time members.The number of 
 children on roll is approximately 140.
 The original school buildings are     
 still in use and 3 wooden classrooms  
 have been added.                      
 The school has its own swimming pool  
 and negotiations are under way for    
 land to be purchased adjacent to the  
 school for a playing field.           
 Both the television ,radio and more   
 recently the computer are used to aid 
 teaching in the classroom.            
 At present a library/resource area is 
 being created and it is hoped that the
 school will continue to expand and    
 change with the times.
