		<title>14Tattingstone Village</title>
		<content> Tattingstone is a quiet little        
 village. The part of Tattingstone in  
 our survey area has one pub, a chapel,
 an ironworks and a playing field with 
 four tennis courts.                   
                                       
 We moved to Tattingstone in 1981. We  
 spent two years renovating our        
 cottage. At first we lived in a       
 caravan in the garden. All the        
 woodwork had to be sprayed to kill the
 woodworm. Eventually we finished and  
 we changed to name from Beckdale back 
 to Tinkers Hole which was its original
 name.                                 
                                       
 Part of the Alton Water reservoir near
 Tattingstone place is a nature        
 conservation area. Lots of bird       
 watchers go here to see coots,        
 moorhens, great crested grebes, herons
 and many other types of bird.         </content>
