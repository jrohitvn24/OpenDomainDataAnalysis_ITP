		<content> THE MAIN FORM OF TRANSPORT IS THE     
 PRIVATE {CAR;}THE RAILWAY IS EXTINCT  
 AND THE DAILY{BUS}SERVICE TO HEXHAM   
 AND BELLINGHAM IS INFREQUENT.  THERE- 
 FORE  IN THE VILLAGE 62 ESTABLISHMENTS
 HAVE A CAR, SOMETIMES A SECOND        
 VEHICLE.  THE B6318 KNOWN AS GENERAL  
 WADE'S MILITARY{ROAD,}LINKS CARLISLE  
 AND NEWCASTLE.  THE B6320 TO          
 BELLINGHAM BY-PASSES THE VILLAGE.  A  
 GOOD NETWORK OF SMALLER ROADS SERVES  
 OUTLYING SETTLEMENTS AND FARMS.  THESE
 ARE MAINLY TARMACADAM AND IN A GOOD   
 STATE OF REPAIR.  GETTING TO THE MAIN 
 ROADS CAN BE DIFFICULT IN THE SNOW IN 
 WINTER.  THE TASK OF CLEARING SMALLER 
 ROADS IS OFTEN LEFT TO THE FARMER'S   
 TRACTOR.  PUBLIC TRANSPORT IS USED BY 
 MOST CHILDREN OVER NINE TO ATTEND     
 HEXHAM SCHOOLS. EARLY MORNING SEES    
 MANY CHILDREN WAITING NEAR THE CROWN  
 INN FOR "SCHOOL BUSES".               </content>
