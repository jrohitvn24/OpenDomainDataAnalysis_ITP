		<content> Seven counties can be seen from the   
 top of the church, built high on a    
 ridge and completed in the 12th       
 century. The nave and aisles finish   
 with plain parapets, the chancel is   
 gable roofed and plain. Of particular 
 interest is one piece of capital      
 depicting two peacocks quarrelling    
 over a morsel. There is a duplicate in
 a church in Normandy and it seems     
 possible the same Norman workman      
 carved both. The 13th century font is 
 tub-shaped on four shafts separated by
 vertical bands of dog tooth. Two rare 
 wooden alms shovels are owned by the  
 church. They have been removed for    
 safe keeping after the helmet and     
 sword of Arthur, Lord Grey de Wilton, 
 who died in 1595 were stolen. The     
 Victorian windows were by Kemp, whose 
 signature of peacocks' feathers can be
 seen on the angels' wings.            </content>
