 My impressions of the sport field by  
 Carol Stevens (9 years)               
 I think that people walk their dogs on
 the field. I see them there. Cubs and 
 Scouts play football rounders,cricket 
 and other sports. The field is used   
 for a fair called Aldmead Fair. The   
 field is a big open space and is a    
 short cut for children coming to      
 school or people going to work.       
 People go to the cemetery at the back 
 of the field. Men and boys plau golf  
 there but they are not supposed to.   
 When I take my friends there I make   
 sure that there  isn't a dog in sight.
 It would be a very nice place to go   
 for a picnic except for the dog's     
 muck.
