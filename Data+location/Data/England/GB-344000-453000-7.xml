		<content>Apart from the one small estate of     
houses and bungalows,the only other    
dwellings are farmhouses. These tend to
be scattered over the block as a whole 
and number seven in total. Some of     
these have "tied" cottages attached    
i.e.dwellings provided for farm        
workers.These were provided rent-free  
or a nominal rent charged which would  
be deducted from the farm labourer's   
wages.                                 
The small estate next to the school is 
a mixture of detached and semi-detached
houses and bungalows, all of which are 
owner-occupied. One of the detached    
bungalows has its own open-air swimming
pool, and some of the bungalows front  
on to the yacht basin and have their   
own moorings.
