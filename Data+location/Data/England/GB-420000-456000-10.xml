		<title>10Kettlesing - Conservation</title>
		<content>   Conservation of the traditional     
 landscape and life style of the area  
 seems to be an important issue to     
 many inhabitants of the block, and    
 was given as an important factor in   
 their choice of residence. Issues such
 as consolidation of farms into larger 
 units, unaesthetic renovation work,   
 low-flying military aircraft (noise   
 pollution), preservation of tradition-
 al amenities such as the local primary
 school, all cause intense interest.   
 Recently, a proposed nuclear survival 
 centre attracted intense local        
 concern, with a well-attended public  
 meeting voicing strong opposition     
 mainly on conservation grounds.
