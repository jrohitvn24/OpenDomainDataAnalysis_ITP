		<content> The main land use in our area is      
 arable.Crops include oil seed         
 rape,wheat,barley,corn,potatoes,peas  
 and sugar beet.The secondary land use 
 is grass which is cut for hay and sil-
 age.The tertiary land use is pasture  
 for sheep,cattle and horses.          
                                       
 This year,1985, the weather was very  
 poor.  We had many wet and windy days 
 during the summer, so that the harvest
 was late and often flattened. This did
 not effect the potatoes and sugar beet
 very much as we had a warm spell      
 during Setember and October which     
 helped them.
