		<title>18The Village of Swepstone</title>
		<content> The village of Swepstone has remained 
 roughly the same size over the years. 
 As old cottages were pulled down,     
 council houses, flats and bungalows   
 have replaced them, since the Council 
 have said village size is to remain in
 proportion.  Thus only infilling has  
 been allowed, houses being built in   
 between existing houses and not in new
 areas.  The community has changed     
 from a farming to a middle-class one, 
 the inhabitants being made up of      
 retired locals and small farm holders,
 and also newcomers like doctors,      
 solicitors and businessmen.  The      
 village has one bus stop, phone box   
 and post box.  The old school is now  
 used as a social meeting-place for    
 clubs like the Guides, Mothers and    
 Toddlers, the Welcome Club and the    
 Mothers' Union.
