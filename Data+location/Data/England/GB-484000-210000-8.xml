		<content>     It's Saturday! I lie in bed until 
9.00 a.m,then I get up and watch       
television.After that I have breakfast 
which usually consists of toast and    
cereal.At 10.00 a.m I receive my one   
pound pocket money and my Dad drives me
down to the newsagents.I buy a magazine
and some bubble gum and then we go     
home.                                  
     I have lunch at 1.00 p.m of       
sausages and chips with a lot of tomato
ketchup.During the afternoon I read a  
supernatural book.Then it's television 
time!!!                                
     I watch many programmes such as   
Dynasty,Wonder Woman and Battle beyond 
the Planets.                           
     Last of all I go to bed at 10.00  
p.m and read.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
