		<content>   The Landlord of the{Sutherland Arms 
 says his pub is the main meeting place
 for the village.                      
   They have no childrens area but the 
 patio windows open on to a lawn where 
 parents can leave their children. A   
{Youth Club}has recently been formed   
 which is quite popular but most       
 teenagers prefer to go to Newport.    
 There is fishing on the river, tennis 
 courts and playing fields. A bowling  
 green has been planned for a few      
 years.                                
   The oldest resident, born in 1888   
 says there are too many new houses    
 and people are far less sociable than 
 before.                               
   Development is controlled by Wrekin 
 District Council to prevent the       
 village becoming too big. Mrs. Clark  
 thinks the 2 shops are adequate for a 
 small village.                        </content>
