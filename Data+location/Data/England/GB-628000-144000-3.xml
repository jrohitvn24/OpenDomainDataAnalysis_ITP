		<title>03Police Station, Whitfield</title>
		<content>The police station is situated on the  
Sandwich road opposite the new houses  
and was built in June 1952. There used 
to be 20 policemen but now there is    
just one village policeman to cover the
whole of the village. The present      
constable has worked here for 4 years  
and thoroughly enjoys his job and in   
his spare time plays football, cricket 
and rugby. He has 3 children who attend
the local schools.                     
Most crime in the village is committed 
by strangers who break the speed limit 
on the A256. The longest crime free    
period was 18 months.
