		<title>11Motorcycle Trials, Mow Cop</title>
		<content>  Along the road from Mow Cop to       
Congleton, just beyond the parking     
areas set out to view Cheshire, there  
is an area set aside for motorcycle    
trials competition. Run by the         
Congleton &amp; District MC Club, which is 
affiliated to the Cheshire Centre      
Autocycle Union (ACU), trials over the 
rough hillside are held about 12 times 
a year. About 100 riders take part and 
are catagarised by age. The first      
Â£Kickstart' BBC programme on trials    
bike riding was held here in November  
1981.                                  
   The land is owned by the farmer Mr. 
Davies at Limekiln Farm.               
   In a trials competition a series of 
obstacles are created using the natural
terrain. The riders then have to ride  
through these areas without putting a  
foot down against time.
