 Gravel used to be called 'hoggin' and 
 was used as a road surface. They dug  
 it up near that road. There is still a
 slight ditch where they dug, because  
 they filled it in.                    
                                       
{The Blacksmith}                       
      A Blacksmith used to live in the 
 village of Bovingdon where he worked. 
 Now he has moved house to just outside
 the village. He had lived in Bovingdon
 for about 20 years. He said Bovingdon 
 was a nice quiet place apart from his 
 drilling. He does not get many        
 visitors in Hogpits Bottom. He owns a 
 black Shetland pony.
