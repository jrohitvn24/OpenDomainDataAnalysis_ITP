		<content>  The name of Milton Coombe is derived 
 from the existence of a mill that     
 stood in the centre of the village    
 which itself is situated  in a steep  
 sided valley, the Devon word for this 
 is coombe, thus Milltown in the Coombe
 or 'Milton Coombe'.                   
  The village enjoys a number of annual
 celebrations:_                        
  The annual brook race, when local men
 race on the bed of the brook from the 
 sewage works to the local pub passing 
 under 10 bridges all approximately 1  
 metre high.                           
  At Easter there is an Easter bonnet  
 race.                                 
  An annual 'Minithon' of six miles.   
  Traditionally on the last day of the 
 year a large proportion of the        
 villagers, who are at home, gather at 
 the pub, the 'Who'd Have Thought It', 
 to welcome in the new year.           </content>
