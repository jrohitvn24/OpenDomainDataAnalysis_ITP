		<content>{1}I don't mind where I live but what I
 don't like is that you can't play with
 a ball just about everywhere you go.  
 The other thing is there are not      
 enough play parks.                    
{2}Sometimes I get bored because there 
 is nowhere to go like sports centres  
 and the cinema.But sometimes I don't  
 mind being in Eggbuckland like when I 
 have got my friends to play with.     
{3}I have very strong feelings about   
 play facilities in our area.There are 
 hardly any parks.There is one field   
 with a sewer running straight through 
 it.Fields are growing houses.Parks are
 vandalised by punks.In Deer Park there
 are 'No Ball Games' signs everywhere. 
 Once there used to be a lovely valley 
 but they have turned it into a silly, 
 noisy,dirty road. Why? There are      
 enough roads already.
