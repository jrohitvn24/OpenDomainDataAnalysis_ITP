		<title>17PETERSFIELD - HOUSING</title>
		<content>{Private houses}have been built along  
 the A3 known locally as the{Causeway  
 for over a mile and similarly along   
{Sussex Road}to beyond the Heath Lake. 
 Houses built along Sussex Road close  
 to the town are old but most of the   
 Causeway and by the Lake were built   
 pre 1939. The majority of the houses  
 form a post war estate west of the A3,
 bounded by{Cranford Road and Grange   
{Road.}Private houses form the eastern 
 end of Cranford Road, the rest were   
 built as council houses although a    
 large proportion have now been bought 
 by the occupiers. A new private estate
 has been built south of Cranford Road 
 near the railway line and its road    
 pattern suggests that it will be      
 extended in the future. Larger proper-
 ties overlook the Heath Lake and some 
 infilling has taken place in an old   
 house's grounds to form{Russell Way.} </content>
