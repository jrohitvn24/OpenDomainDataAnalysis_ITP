		<title>12Living in Ditton (Kent)</title>
		<content> I like living in Ditton because the   
 houses are nicely spaced. Right in the
 middle there is a parade of shops.    
 Grown-ups can get to work easily from 
 here. There is an excellent railway   
 line for people who work in London.   
 There are many things to join such as 
 Cubs, Brownies, Scouts, Guides and    
 Youth Clubs. We have lots of play     
 areas. The swimming pool at Larkfield 
 is not far away. Ditton is an         
 interesting place. By the church are  
 some Tudor cottages and the Old Mill  
 House. Nearby the stream crosses the  
 road and there is a ford. Children    
 like to paddle there. My name is      
 Samantha and I am 11. I have lived in 
 Ditton all my life so I do not know   
 what other places are like to live in 
 but I think Ditton is a great village.
