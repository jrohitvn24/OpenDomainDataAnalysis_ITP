		<title>10   USING COMPUTERS</title>
		<content> At our local shopping centre there is 
 a television rental shop which has a {
{computer-linked till.}Televisions,    
 videos and tapes are all coded. On the
 till there is a wand which looks like 
 a small gun with a light on it. When  
 you run it over a code the information
 goes to the micro-computer's memory.  
 You can scan forwards or backwards,   
 but you must scan only once for one   
 credit to a customer's rental account.
   At six o'clock when all the people  
 in the shop have gone home, a large   
 computer rings up the micro-computer  
 through a modem and collects all the  
 day's information for processing. Many
 branches are linked by their computers
 and managers can check stock at other 
 shops. This{"Thorntell"}system of     
 transferring and sorting information  
 has made running the service much     
 easier and more efficient.            </content>
