		<title>19HOLY TRINITY CHURCH,EXMOUTH</title>
		<content> On Friday 5th July, our class climbed 
 the 100 foot high tower of Holy       
 Trinity Church. Mr. Tuckett, the      
 church warden said that there were 120
 spiral steps to climb to reach the    
 top. When we had climbed up 40 steps  
 to the clock room Mr. Tuckett told us 
 some things about the clock. We then  
 had to climb another 80 steps and in  
 doing so passed the bell room. We     
 could not go in there though because  
 it would have been too much of a      
 squash. When we reached the top we    
 were all very tired! We looked through
 the gaps in the tower and could see   
 for miles. We saw the beach, All      
 Saints Church and our school. We could
 see right across the Estuary to       
 Dawlish Warren. After we had climbed  
 down again we were feeling quite      
 dizzy, but we all thoroughly enjoyed  
 our visit.                            </content>
