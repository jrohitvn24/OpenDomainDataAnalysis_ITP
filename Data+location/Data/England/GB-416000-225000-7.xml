		<content> The{Cotswolds,}situated between{Oxford
 and{Stratford,}has great appeal for   
 tourists. The Tourist Information     
 Centre housed in the Library in the   
 Square receives up to 50 enquiries per
 day at the height of the holiday      
 season. Most enquiries are for        
{accommodation,}particularly Bed and   
 Breakfast. Many local householders    
 take advantage of the tourist trade by
 using their spare rooms for this      
 purpose.                              
  There are, of course, plenty         
 of{hotels}providing full board within 
 the D-block. One is part of the Crest 
 chain of hotels (the Unicorn), but    
 most are privately owned or are part  
 of a brewery's chain of public houses 
 that also offer accommodation. Several
 of the hotels began life as{coaching  
{inns}when Stow was on several coach   
 routes before the Railway Age dawned. </content>
