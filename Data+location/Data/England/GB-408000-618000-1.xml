 nineteen pupils of{Eglingham C.E.First

 meant{Egwulf people's homestead,      
 belonged to Tynemouth Priory.It passed
 to the Ogle family and later became   
 the property of the Milvains who owned
 all the land and houses until recently
  The region is steeped in history.

 Anglo-Saxon and Roman occupation. At

 hospital. More laterly in the         
 nineteenth century was the case of the
