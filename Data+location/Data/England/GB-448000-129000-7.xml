		<content> Winchester Cathedral is massive.      
 The Nave was built by William of      
 Wykeham from 1367 to 1404.His effigy  
 is there. William also founded        
 Winchester College. There is also a   
 statue of William Walker, who 80 years
 ago, put sacks of cement under the    
 Cathedral to stop it from sinking down
 into the marsh. There is also what is 
 called the" Holy Hole" which is a     
 door leading to St Swithun's shrine.  
 In the Lady Chapel is Queen Mary      
 Tudor's folding chair used when she   
 was married to Philip of Spain .      
 Because their wedding was  very long ,
 she had to rest on the chair. There   
 are three different styles of arch    
 Norman, Perpendicular Gothic and Early
 English The Cathedral was started in  
 1079. William Rufus was buried in 1100
 and the Norman tower fell down in     
 1106.Was it an act of God ?           </content>
