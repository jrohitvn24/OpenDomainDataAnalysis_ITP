		<title>11IZAAK WALTON, ANGLER</title>
		<content> Izaak Walton, an angling expert,      
 lived from 1593 to 1683.  He was born 
 and baptised in Stafford, otherwise   
 nothing is known of his early life.   
 He owned a small business in London   
 and after his retirement Walton lived 
 intermittently on the Halfhead farm   
 estate at Shallowford.  Walton        
 bequeathed an estate cottage to       
 Stafford for the benefit of the poor. 
 It is now a museum.   Shallowford     
 Brook which runs by the cottage was a 
 favourite angling haunt of Walton.    
 Izaak Walton is best known as the     
 author of The Compleat Angler, an     
 anthology of fishing lore.  It        
 includes recipes, legends and poems.  
 The book, first published in 1653,    
 remains popular with anglers to this  
 day.
