    Hamstreet School is quite big      
 with square buildings. Part of        
 the school is very old, it is the     
 original building,it is built of brick
 with small, high windows.The new      
 building has much more glass and seems
 more roomy.There are ten classes.The  
 school covers the ages of 5 years old 
 to 11 years old. At dinner time we go 
 into the biggest building of all and  
 we have half an hour to eat our       
 lunch.At play time we eat our         
 crisps.We play cricket at our school  
 and netball, rounders and football.I'm
 in the school football team.We also go
 swimming.We start at nine'o'clock and 
 we end at 3.15 and our first play is  
 at 10.45. Lunch time is at 12.00      
 o'clock.We have a last play time at   
 2.25.                                 </content>
