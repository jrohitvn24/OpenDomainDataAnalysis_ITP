		<title>19PLAYGROUND GAMES</title>
		<content> During breaks from lessons these are  
 some of the games played by children  
 living in this block.                 
{SPORTS}Football especially is popular 
 but other games include netball and   
 cricket.                              
{CHASING AND CATCHING GAMES}The most   
 popular is Bulldog where the catcher  
 has to stand in the middle of the     
 playground with the runners at one    
 end. The catcher names a person who   
 tries to run past. As soon as the     
 named person has run, all the others  
 start. Anyone who is caught becomes a 
 catcher. In order to be catch someone 
 they have to be held, sometimes off   
 the ground, while the catcher says,   
 "British Bulldog 1,2,3".              
 Various sorts of tag are popular at   
 different times including Off Ground  
 He, Sticky Toffee, Buzz, and Drain He 
 which uses drain covers as home.      </content>
