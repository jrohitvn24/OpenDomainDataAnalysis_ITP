		<content> get all the nibs in the pog by        
 flicking the marbles with the fore-   
 finger.Each plays in turn,the play    
 passing to the next player if you fail
 to get the nib in the pog.Different   
 sized marbles rate different values   
 with the oner being the smallest,a    
 twoer being a larger marble,a dobber  
 valued at four and potters,catseyes   
 and peaballs valued at ten. The chief 
 cause of arguement is the 'pusher'    
 when the nib is seen to be pushed     
 rather than flicked.When a player is  
 seen to 'push' he is challenged and   
 the play passes to the next player.   
    There are two basic games, one just
 a fun game and a more serious game    
 when the person who successfully pogs 
 the last nib collects all the marbles 
 in play.
