		<title>06BINHAM MANOR FARM CONT.</title>
		<content> Binham Manor Farm is regarded as one  
 of the oldest in the area.  It was    
 restored in 1624 and it is believed to
 have been built in the early 14th     
 century.  The buildings are made of   
 red sandstone and displays some       
 interesting features of a traditional 
 farm house.  Today, there are 5 men   
 working the farm which indicates the  
 extent to which modern technology has 
 released farmers from the cost of     
 employing farm hands.  This farm      
 displays an intensity of single       
 product farming which compares with   
 the Crossman in Withycombe.
