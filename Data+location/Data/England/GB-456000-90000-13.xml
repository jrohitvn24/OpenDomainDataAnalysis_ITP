		<content>   The face of the village of{Binstead 
 has changed over the past decade.     
 There has been building over a large  
 scale and the fields which stretched  
 out as far as{Dame Anthony's Common   
 are fields no more but a large housing
 estate. Many local residents in the   
 village are upset by the disappearance
 of 'their' fields where they took     
 walks.                                
  {Havenstreet,}on the other hand, has 
 no large estates and the new          
 properties are built in between the   
 older houses in the village. it still 
 remains a quiet, country village.     
   The children of{Binstead School}have
 helped to{name some of the roads}on   
 the new estate in Binstead- Hillrise  
 Avenue, Chestnut Close, Cleaver Close.
 Gordon Close a small collection of new
 houses behind the old school was named
 after the chairman of the Governors.  </content>
