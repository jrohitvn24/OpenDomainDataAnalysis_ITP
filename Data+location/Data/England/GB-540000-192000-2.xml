		<title>02FEATURES OF BUCKHURST HILL</title>
		<content> Buckhurst Hill extends westwards from 
 the River Roding for about two miles. 
 It merges into Woodford going south   
 and Loughton to the north.            
  When Buckhurst Hill first developed  
 it had no place of worship so locals  
 had to cross the Rodoing by the often 
 flooded church path to Chigwell church
 on the other side of the valley.In    
 1837,however, this situation was      
 rectified by the building ,along the  
 High Road , of St. John the           
 Baptist.Also  on the High Road is the 
 Bald-Faced Stag,a pub standing on the 
 site of a coaching inn that served    
 travellers on the London to Newmarket 
 coach road(now the A11).              
  Buckhurst Hill is now a suburb of    
 London,with a mixture of grand,old    
 houses and new housing.The housing is 
 broken up by parts of Epping Forest,  
 known as Lords Bushes.                </content>
