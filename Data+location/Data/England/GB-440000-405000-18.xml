		<title>18My Favourite Toy.</title>
		<content> My favourite toy is my{motor bike.}I  
 play with it on the drive and on the  
 back lane. Once I went down Chapel    
 Lane.                                 
 My motor bike is a Yamaha. My Dad     
 changed my small one for a bigger one 
 when I was seven years old. I was five
 when I first got one. It has three    
 gears and the back brake is a pedal   
 which you press down with your foot to
 stop.                                 
 My Dad puts petrol in it from a can   
 out of the car. I can pull wheelies on
 my bike and make jumps. I play on it  
 at the weekend and when I get home    
 from school.
