		<content>     Every house in our area is        
 supplied with electricity in the form 
 of alternating current at 50 cycles   
 per second and 240 Volts pressure.  As
 our country is small it is convenient 
 to link all the generating stations   
 together by overhead power cables.    
 This is known as the 'national grid'. 
 This means that if any one station is 
 shut down, the working stations can   
 share the load.  Only very rarely is  
 there a voltage reduction or a black  
 out.                                  
     The power lines in our area carry 
 electricity at 11000 Volts.           
 Transformer substations reduce this to
 240 Volts, more convenient for our use
     Modern wiring uses a ring main    
 system fused at 30 Amperes. Any       
 individual plug can take a maximum of 
 l3 Amperes but may be fused at  a much
 lower rating than this.               </content>
