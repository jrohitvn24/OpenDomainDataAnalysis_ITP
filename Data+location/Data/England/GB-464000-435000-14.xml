		<title>14 Complaints About Whitemoor</title>
		<content>The fields around the farm have had to 
be redrained as the dike was not       
working. This is due to subsidence.    
Some of the concrete on and around the 
farm is cracking. All new roads on the 
farm are not being concreted. Instead, 
half housebricks are being used as they
don't crack, they just move. Even the  
road past Whitemoor Mine to Cliffe has 
recently been re-surfaced. Our back    
garden path is starting to crack. We   
were told by coal board surveyors to   
expect a one metre subsidence but a    
mine worker told us to expect more.It  
is expected to be worse in l987. Apart 
from the subsidence, we hardly notice  
the mine until it starts blasting. It  
is quite a landmark if we get lost on  
some back road.
