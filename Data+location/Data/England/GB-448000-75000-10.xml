		<content> On most land based Stations there are 
 three families;any children on        
 stations of this sort are very        
 fortunate  as they have vast areas of 
 grass to play on,free from traffic,   
 and obviously no pollution problems.  
 As for the working side,it is probably
 best described as a cross between     
 caretaking and coastguarding.The      
 beauty of the job is the fact that you
 only have to climb out of bed and     
 you're at work!                       
                                       
 Four men work on a shift system to    
 cover 24 hours a day,365 days a year. 
                                       
 A constant watch is kept on the       
 weather,in case of fog,also           
 St.Catherine's is one of the many     
 Lighthouses which report weather      
 conditions every hour to the          
 Meteorological Office.                </content>
