		<content>  This block is unspoilt by pollution  
 and is conserved by the efforts of the
{North Yorkshire Dales National Park.} 
  There are many varieties of wild     
 flowers.These grow on the moorland,   
 meadows and pasture, in and around the
 woodland and along the river-side.    
  Some of the hillsides are rough,wild 
 and bleak.Most of the rocky outcrops  
 are natural.There are many footpaths  
 and bridleways across our area.Some of
 the paths are very old and are called 
 'green tracks'.They are between 1metre
 and 3metres wide and are often bounded
 by dry stone walls on each side. These
 were old pack horse routes.           
  The weather can be severe in winter. 
 The snow comes earlier, lies deeper   
 and stays longer than in lower        
 regions.The extra height gives a lower
 temperature.The height of the school  
 is 286metres above sea level.         </content>
