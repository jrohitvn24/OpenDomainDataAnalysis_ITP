		<title>11BEARSTED LIBRARY</title>
		<content> Bearsted library is situated in the   
 centre of the village in an old       
 picturesque building, which was once  
 the village school and one of the     
 focal points of the village. It was   
 given the role of library in Sept.    
 1975. It caters mainly for the village
 centre as there is another library on 
 the other side of the village. The    
 library noticeboard provides details  
 of local events and activities that   
 are taking place in the village. Both 
 Bearsted and Thurnham Parish Council  
 minutes can be found on display to    
 anyone wishing to inspect them. The   
 library is open every day except      
 Monday and Sunday. It has a late night
 for many of the readers are regular   
 commuters not arriving home until     
 after 6pm. It provides a valuable     
 service to an expanding area of       
 Bearsted and Thurnham.                </content>
