		<title>07Tunstall Farm, Nr. Gt.Ayton</title>
		<content> Tunstall Farm, in the north of our    
 area and bordering the wooded parkland
 of the Middlesbrough greenbelt, is    
 mostly 150 acres of grassland for     
 cattle ,sheep and the 20 ponies that  
 are used in the riding stables here.  
 People are taught to ride in the      
 riding school, but can also go pony   
 trecking. Though most of the land is  
 under grass, wheat and barley are     
 grown for fodder. One small wood has  
 been demolished and several hedges    
 have recently gone, but some extensive
 conifer tree planting has taken place 
 along the northern boundary of the    
 farm.                                 
  The village of Tunstall is now mere  
 humps in a field, most of the houses  
 having been abandoned  after          
 enclosures.
