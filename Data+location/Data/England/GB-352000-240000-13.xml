		<title>13HOME LIFE IN LUGWARDINE</title>
		<content>   Out of a population of approx. 500, 
 30 regularly attend the Parish Church 
 of St Peter's in Lugwardine, yet 80%  
 receive the Parish Magazine. Records  
 are continuous from 1546. Burials are 
 still traditional here - only 30% are 
 cremated. Few families have young     
 children. Out of 79 children at the   
 village school, only 17 live in the   
 area studied. The remainder come from 
 the 150 houses on the estate at       
 Wilcroft. The present school, built in
 1840, is inadequate and a new village 
 school is likely to be built on the   
 Wilcroft Estate in the near future.   
 Children eat packed lunches at school,
 so families eat together in the       
 evening. Shopping is done at a nearby 
 supermarket or in the City. Much fresh
 fruit and veg. is grown locally. It is
 normal for families to have two cars. 
 Most use microwave ovens, videos etc. </content>
