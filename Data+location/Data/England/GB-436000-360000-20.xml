		<title>20Out of School Hours</title>
		<content>  Parents and friends of{Stretton      
{Handley School}join the children in   
 extra-school activities. We had a very
 successful barbecue again this year.  
 It rained but we had a marquee and    
 everyone enjoyed themselves. Over Â£100
 was raised for school library books.  
  On another occasion we walked and    
 cycled along the High Peak Trail.     
  We have formed a Friends of the      
 School Organisation to run functions. 
 We are going to Blackpool in October. 
                                       
  One of{Clay Cross Centre's}evening   
 classes meets in the school. The      
 members can do any kind of sewing and 
 there is a teacher who can help with  
 the cutting and fitting of garments.
