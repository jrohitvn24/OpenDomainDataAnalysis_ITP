		<title>20The River Brue</title>
		<content> The River Brue is very important to   
 the Somerset Levels because the amount
 of peat here makes the ground very    
 boggy after heavy rainfall. A system  
 of drainage ditches or rhynes leads   
 from the Brue which has to be cleaned 
 out every autumn because of the large 
 amount of weed etc which collects.    
 A recent dip into the river where it  
 is joined by the Mill Stream revealed 
 a wide selection of water life        
 including common reed, duckweed,      
 tubifex, water spiders, water boatmen,
 upside-down boatmen, water snails,    
 water scorpions, pond skaters, water  
 beetle larvae and swan mussels.       
 The river is sometimes used for fund  
 raising events like the Baltonsborough
 Splash which takes place annually.    
 Home made rafts are raced from        
 Wallyer's  Bridge to the weir.
