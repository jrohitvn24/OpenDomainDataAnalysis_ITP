		<content>  For many years{Evesham}has been      
 asking for a{by-pass}to divert traffic
 from the town centre and so relieve   
 congestion upon the town's two        
 bridges.                              
  The by-pass, which has in{1985}been  
 given the final{'go-ahead'}will entail
 the building of a new bridge on the   
 Offenham side of Evesham. The new road
 will,in the area,run from between     
 Bengeworth and Badsey,across mainly   
 orchard land and crossing the river   
 between Oxstall's Farm and the        
 Offenham ferry.                       
  Growers in that area are unhappy     
 about the division and the compulsary 
 purchase of their prime market        
 gardening land although compensation  
 wil be awarded to them. This has been 
 a local issue for many years and now  
 appears,in 1986,to be coming to a     
 head.                                 </content>
