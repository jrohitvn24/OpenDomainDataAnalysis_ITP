		<title>19LITTLE CLACTON TRAFFIC COUNT</title>
		<content> A lot of the people who we interviewed
 talked about the traffic coming       
 through the village. We thought we    
 would do a traffic count on a Sunday  
 morning. The people who did the count 
 sat next to the road between 9-12 on a
 Sunday morning and we counted the     
 traffic going by. They would be mainly
 day trippers going to the sea.        
 Passing through Little Clacton in 3   
 hours were :_                         
              2062 cars                
              38 coaches               
              31 motor bikes           
     Altogether this is 2131 vehicles. 
 This is more than 700 an hour         
         or about 12 a minute          
         or 1 car every 4 seconds.     
                                       
 And dont forget there are another 2131
 vehicles to go back through our       
 village in the evening !!             </content>
