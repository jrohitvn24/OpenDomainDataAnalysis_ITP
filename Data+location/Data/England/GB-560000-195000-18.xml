		<content> We were shown around the 300 year old 
 farm which originated from a          
 blacksmiths.We walked up to some      
 massive silos which contained about 20
 tons of grain.They are cleaned,       
 inspected,heated and sprayed once a   
 year.The cows have calves when they   
 are three years old.120 calves are    
 born each year between September and  
 March,but because there aren't any    
 fields for grazing they must be sent  
 to Mountnessing.                      
  It has a pond which is spring fed and
 nearly as old as the farm itself.The  
 wildlife around the 100 acre arable   
 farm varies from foxes,rabbits and    
 squirrels to kestrels,owls and bats.We
 were introduced to Jack and Sebastian 
 the goats.We brought a horn made from 
 hair which belonged to Jack back to   
 school.Cyril and the girls are geese  
 and they gave us a squawking goodbye. </content>
