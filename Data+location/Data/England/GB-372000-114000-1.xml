		<title>01BLACKMORE VALE DAIRY FARMING</title>
		<content>    This area of excellent grasslands  
 which supports many dairy farms lies  
 in N.E Dorset between the villages of 
 Stalbridge and Sturminster Newton in  
 the centre of the Blackmore Vale,     
 Thomas Hardy's Vale of Milk.Stalbridge
 has the nearest church,school,shops   
 and post-office.Sturminster a calf    
 market and cheese factory.            
   Originally part of the royal hunting
 forest of Gillingham the area was slow
 to be cleared and settled.The name    
 Blackmore/moor shows that for ages the
 land was dark and wet but as improve- 
 ments were made the alluvial soil     
 proved to be very fertile and,together
 with a good rainfall grew superb grass
 The water meadows of the small river  
 and 2 brooks easily flood and are     
 little use.Stalbridge Weston hamlet   
 and a big house are built on high land
 The area is thinly populated.         </content>
