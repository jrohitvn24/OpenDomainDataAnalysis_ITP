		<content>    There are two military cemeteries  
on Cannock Chase and we visited both.  
    1) The German Military Cemetery.   
The Cemetery contains the graves of    
about 5000 members of the German armed 
forces who died in Britain during both 
World Wars. The Cemetery is neatly laid
with heather between the graves, grass 
paths and silver birch trees. In the   
centre is a large stone cross. We saw  
from the visitors book that people from
all over of the world had visited here.
                                       
    2) The Commonwealth Cemetery.      
The graves were laid out between grass 
paths and each white gravestone had    
the badge of the man's regiment on it. 
The soldiers' ages were also on the    
stones and we noticed how young many   
of the men were when they died.
