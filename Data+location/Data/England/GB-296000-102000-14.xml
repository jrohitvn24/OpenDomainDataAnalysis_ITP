		<title>14Bradninch Papermill (cont)</title>
		<content>   Wiggins Teape make writing paper,   
 blotting paper, filter paper, paper   
 for batteries, dust bags and a base   
 paper for formica work surfaces.      
   In 1984 they made 10,500 tonnes. The
 mill has lots of danger and the       
 manager has to make sure it is as safe
 as possible. Some men work in very    
 noisy conditions and need to wear ear 
 plugs. 195 people work there, 138 men 
 and 13 women make the paper and 27 in 
 administration jobs. The mill is      
 working from 6am. Monday until 6pm. on
 Saturday 24 hours a day. Most people  
 work 5 days a week on day or night    
 shift. They have five weeks holiday   
 (Easter, Christmas and Bank Holidays).
