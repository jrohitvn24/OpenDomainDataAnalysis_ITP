		<content>  The Chartist Estate of Snig's End was
 built in 1848 on the border between   
 the parishes of Corse and Staunton by 
 Fergus O'Connor. It is of considerable
 interest to social historians. 80     
 single storey houses were built of    
 good materials. Every house had two   
 bedrooms, a living room, kitchen,     
 skullery, dairy and well. Each house  
 had a holding of 2-4 acres planted    
 with fruit trees and cash crops but   
 sadly marketing was poor and the      
 original intention of helping working 
 people to get not only the vote but   
 agricultural holdings did not succeed.
 Today about 60 of the houses still    
 exist. Most no longer have very much  
 land but two still provide a living.  
 The Chartist Meeting House is now a   
 pub. Staunton Church has a good       
 Jacobean monument and 15th Century    
 barrel vaulting in the North Aisle.   </content>
