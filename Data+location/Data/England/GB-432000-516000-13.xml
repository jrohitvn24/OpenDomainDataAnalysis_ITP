		<content> Mrs. Dodds was born in 1902 and went  
 to the old village school.Her teacher 
 was a man called Mr.Davidson and there
 was only one other teacher.She started
 school when she was five and stayed   
 there till she was twelve.If she      
 misbehaved she would get the cane     
 across her hands.She might have got   
 the cane for playing tricks,doing bad 
 work or getting her sewing or knitting
 wrong.She learned a lot of scripture  
 and prayers which she can still       
 remember.She did an hours homework    
 each night.There was a farm right in  
 the middle of the village in those    
 days,now it is a house called Tithe   
 House.They had no cars just horses and
 carts.At school they played skipping, 
 tops and whips and bowling hoops.I am 
 unhappy because Mrs.Dodds died last   
 week.I used to go messages for her.
