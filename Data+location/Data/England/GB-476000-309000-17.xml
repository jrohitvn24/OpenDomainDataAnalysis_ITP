		<content>Next day I went to school and when I   
came home Mummy had brought Misty home 
and I got changed and went to Sues     
house and then Richard and I went for a
ride down the Grove.  Richard rode     
Winston, and me and Richard walked our 
ponies on our own, and trotted on our  
own, and then we went home, BUT we     
couldn't go home on our own because    
High Street is too busy.
