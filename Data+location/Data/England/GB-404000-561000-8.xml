		<title>08LOOKING AFTER MY PONY</title>
		<content> I have a pony called Star. He is black
 with a white sock on one foot and a   
 white star on his forehead. That is   
 how he got his name.  I keep him in a 
 field behind our house. We pay grazing
 rent to the farmer.                   
 In Winter I feed Star on hay in the   
 morning and at night he is given pony 
 nuts or a mixture of bran and sugar   
 beet mixed with water.                
 In Summer he does not need to be fed  
 because there is enough grass. When it
 is hot the stream dries up so I fill  
 an old bath with water for him to     
 drink.                                
 In the Summer Mam and I wash him with 
 horse shampoo.                        
 Sometimes I go for rides with my      
 friends but usually Dad takes me to   
 the football field.
