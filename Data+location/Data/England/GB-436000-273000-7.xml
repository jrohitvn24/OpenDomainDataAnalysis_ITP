{Conservation Trust}own two sites      
 within the area:{Brandon Marsh,}at    
 134acres, and{Ryton on Dunsmore       
{sandpits.}Both are areas of former    
 quarry workings.                      
  Brandon Marsh is one of the finest   
{wetland}sites in Warwickshire. Many   
 waterfowl and waterside plants are to 
 be found here. The site also includes 
 an area of{heath grassland}and an area
 of{woodland,}the "Old Hare Covert".   
  Ryton on Dunsmore sandpits are less  
 important as part of the site is still
 being worked. However it does have    
 potential for the future, as a bird   
 sanctuary in particular.

 reserves and about the work of WARNACT
