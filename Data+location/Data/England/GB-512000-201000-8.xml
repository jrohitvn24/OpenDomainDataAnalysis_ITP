		<content>There is a large area of common-land,  
which is especially interesting because
parts of it are very wet and           
boggy.Many fungi grow there,and in the 
autumn of 1984,120 different species   
were recorded.There is a lot of        
woodland and scrubland,but few areas   
of bracken. The usual small mammals    
are to be found,but of outstanding     
interest is the  Muntjac deer,small    
herds inhabiting the common.It is      
about the size of a small dog, and its 
cry is similar to the bark of a dog.It 
is a shy creature and not often seen.  
There are many footpaths all over the  
area,which are quite well used by      
local people.Beside the river Ver is a 
footpath leading right to St.Albans and
beyond.
