		<title>02The Swyncombe Trust Farm.</title>
		<content>The majority of the farmland belongs to
the Trust and here the farming pattern 
has changed in the last year.  Until   
autumn 1984 Coates Farm was on lease   
and the other 4 farms were managed for 
the Estate.  The Home Farm continues to
be run by a farm manager and is mainly 
parkland put to sheep.  The remaining  
land is now a farm share scheme.  The  
owner provides the land and half the   
fixed costs and the farmer provides the
other half plus the machinery and      
labour.  The profits are shared.       
The land is all arable with barley pre-
dominating; half the crop, approx. 300 
acres, being winter barley, and the    
rest spring barley, winter wheat, rape 
and triticale (bearded wheat).Two men  
are employed and the harvesting        
machinery is owned by the farmer.  The 
straw is burnt not baled.  Contractors 
are used only for hedge-trimming.      </content>
