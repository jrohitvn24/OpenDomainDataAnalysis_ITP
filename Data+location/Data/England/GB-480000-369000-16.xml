		<title>16Transport in South Clifton</title>
		<content> South Clifton is an isolated village  
 in many repects.It is about 12 miles  
 from Lincoln and Newark and about 14  
 miles from Gainsborough.It has no     
 public bus service apart from a bus   
 run by a private bus company,on a     
 wednesday at 9.45 which takes shoppers
 to Newark market.It returns about 1.30
 in the afternoon. Until the Beeching  
 axe in 1963 there was a train service 
 from North Clifton Station which meant
 a walk of about 1 mile.The railway    
 line has been closed since a          
 derailment in 1973.It is now a        
 necessity to possess a car if you do  
 not wish to be cut off from the       
 outside world.Many people have to rely
 on the goodwill of friends and        
 neighbours to take them into town.
