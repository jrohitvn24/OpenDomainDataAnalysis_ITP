		<content> At present there are 59 memebers on   
 Woodspring council,and because of the 
 housing and population growth in      
 Weston-super-mare,some areas there are
 under-represented.                    
   The council wishes to increase the  
 number of councillors for Weston,     
 partly by reducing the number for the 
 rural areas of Woodspring.            
   These proposals would affect Redhill
 and Butcombe.At present Wrington and  
 Redhill share a councillor,but it is  
 reccommended that Redhill should no   
 longer be included with Wrington,but  
 should share a councillor with        
 Butcombe,Burrington and Blagdon.      
   The parish councillors for Redhill  
 object to this,as Redhill is closely  
 linked with Wrington geographically   
 and socially,but has little connection
 with Blagdon.
