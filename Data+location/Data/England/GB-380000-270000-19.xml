		<content>   Mr. Collins is 80 years old and has 
 lived in Stourport all his life.The   
 shops in Stourport during the war     
 didn't have a lot of things.He had to 
{queue}outside the butchers shop for 3 
 hours.He says that there have been    
 many changes during the past 20 years.
 He mainly shops in town occasionally  
 visiting Worcester.Conditions were    
 worse during the{first war}than the   
 second war.He{started work at 13}and  
 had to walk to Kidderminster to work  
 in a{mill.}He remembers whilst at     
 school writing in a{tray of sand}with 
 his finger and the subjects studied   
 were very limited.The power station   
 was built in the 1920's and brought a 
 lot of employment.(This power station 
 was closed in the Spring of 1985)
