		<title>07F.L.S. BARBECUE.</title>
		<content>On July 7th the Friends of Longworth   
School held a barbecue for the fourth  
year running.Tickets cost 1pound50p for
an adult and 1 pound for children.     
About 150 people came along.To eat     
we had barbecued chicken and sausages  
together with various salads that      
people had donated.For sweet we        
had strawberries and cream,the         
strawberries were fresh picked that    
morning by the Hubbert family.After    
wards various activities were          
organised there were rounders,         
football and a tug of war.We also went 
swimming in the school pool.It was a   
great family event and quite cheap.We  
think the best events were the tug of  
war and the swimming.It was a hot and  
sunny day and everybody had a good     
time.
