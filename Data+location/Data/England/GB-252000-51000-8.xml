		<title>08The Yealmpton Branch Railway</title>
		<content> The Yealmpton Railway was opened in   
 January 1898 by Lady Morley.It started
 at Plymouth Friary and ended at       
 Yealmpton, a total distance of six    
 miles east.Towards its end it ran     
 along the banks of the River Yealm,   
 just outside our block. The planned   
 terminus at Modbury was never reached,
 and so the track terminated just past 
 Yealmpton in thick woods. The stations
 in order from Plymouth Friary were:   
 Plymstock, Billacombe, Elburton,      
 Brixton Road, Steer Point &amp; Yealmpton.
 The line was worked as a passenger    
 service for 38 years. In its early    
 life the line carried Elburton produce
 to the market, such as milk,cream,and 
 local vegetables and during the early 
 1900's large amounts of the famous    
 home-grown tomatoes. The Branch was   
 finally shut down on 28th August 1960 
 after 62 years of service.            </content>
