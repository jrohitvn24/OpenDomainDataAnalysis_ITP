		<title>07Housing, Sherborne St. John</title>
		<content> The housing in the village of         
 Sherborne St.John is as varied as that
 of North Basingstoke in age, type and 
 density. The village contains various 
 cottages built on timber frames and   
 infilled with wattle and daub, brick  
 and stone.  There are many cottages   
 built by the Vyne Estate for its      
 workers. These cottages have been     
 modernised but all maintain an        
 identifiable style. There are         
 individual Georgian and Victorian     
 grand houses some of which were old   
 farm houses. There is an estate of    
 council houses built in the 1950's, a 
 council developemnt of old people's   
 bungalows and maisonettes built in the
 1970's, and a road of private         
 bungalows. There has been much        
 infilling with modern detached        
 housing. There are also scattered     
 rural premises of many types.         </content>
