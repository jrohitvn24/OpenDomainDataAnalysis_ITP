  One Saturday I woke up and I jumped  
 out of bed. I got washed and I had my 
 breakfast.  I had muesli with milk,   
 then toast and marmalade.  Then I went
 in the Best Turned Out Competition.  I
 went in as clean as can be.  I won    
 first prize and then we came home and 
 we had our dinner.

  When I woke up one Saturday morning, 
 it was the Church Fete day.  We had to
 wear our school shorts and tee shirts 
 for the Country Dancing display.      
 There were lots of stalls.  When the  
 dancing was over I was glad because   
 then I went on the Bouncy Castle.  It 
 was filled with air and we could jump 
 around. Then I looked at the stalls. I
 enjoyed the dancing.  It was fun.
