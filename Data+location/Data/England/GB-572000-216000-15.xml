		<title>15GAME KEEPING</title>
		<content> The larger local farmers employ game  
 keepers.A trainee gamekeeper works a  
 40 hr week,and sometimes starts at    
 7.00 am and doesn't finish until 10pm.
 As the balance of nature has been     
 destoyed by man because of the        
 spraying of pesticides and removing of
 hedgerows,his job is to restore that  
 balance by reducing numbers of        
 wildlife where necessary.He often     
 walks 5-6 mile per day to catch       
 rats,weasels,stoats,foxes,squirrels   
 and rabbits.                          
 He also breeds pheasants and partridge
 for the shooting season and protects  
 them from bad weather and             
 pesticides.He also protects crops from
 pests by using bangers to scare them  
 off.Unfortunately some get used to it.
