		<title>16C.E. School - Yesteryear</title>
		<content>   In 1915 Ravensworth school was a lot
 different to now. There were 90       
 children in the old school. There was 
 one small room for the infants and a  
 big room for the juniors. It was      
 heated by an open fire . Children had 
 to walk to school from each village in
 all kinds of weather. There were few  
 bicycles in those days and children   
 brought their own dinners. The first  
 drink the children had in school was  
 in the winter, when they were given   
 the choice of 'Oxo' or 'Horlicks'. If 
 anyone was naughty they got the cane. 
   The children stayed at school until 
 they were 14. Every week a man went   
 round to find out why anyone was off, 
 he was known as the {'Kid Catcher'}   
 The parents had to pay for their      
 children to go to school. When the    
 children left school they went into   
 service as maids or farmhands.        </content>
