		<title>15A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> My name is Rebecca Davis.I am one of  
 only two people living inside the     
 rectangle allocated to our school.I   
 enjoy living at Langore.There are many
 people who live in the village they   
 are all nice and easy to get on       
 with.We have a lot of things to       
 entertain us with.There are fetes     
 every summer which once every three   
 years are held inside our area.We also
 have disco's every so often in the    
 Parish hall.Recently we have been     
 having fund raising events for a      
 childrens play area.We think that the 
 play area has improved the village    
 quite alot.The children have stopped  
 playing on the village green which has
 pleased quite a few people.The village
 is surrounded by farm land and farmers
 dont mind us playing in the fields as 
 long as we shut all the gates         
 afterwards.                           </content>
