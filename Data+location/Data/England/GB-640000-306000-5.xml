		<content> Contemporary planning regulations     
 limit new building in either Tunstall 
 or Halvergate. Agricultural building  
 is allowed at the discression of the  
 planning commitee.                    
 Only Halvergate is allowed residential
 housing as relacement or infill.      
 Tunstall consists of two farms with   
 three farm houses. The remaining      
 twenty houses are either council owned
 or tied cottages. There has been no   
 building since the 1940s.             
 Halvergate has two farms and          
 farmhouses and Halvergate Hall which  
 is no longer a farm. Twenty furthur   
 houses are either tied or council. The
 remaining 100 houses are all owner    
 occupied, most were built 1960-1970,  
 some however are centuries old.       
 There is no derelict housing in       
 these areas.
