		<title>14Spendiff</title>
		<content>Spendiff is a tiny hamlet in a         
traditional rural setting.It is remote 
in terms of accessibility and consists 
of half a dozen houses and two farms.  
But it also has a Wesleyan Church where
occasional services are still held.    
With no pub,shop or bus service        
Spendiff has little to offer.Its only  
significance is that it actually lies  
equidistant from the three main        
villages of the area,Cliffe(in the     
survey),Cliffe Woods and High Halstow  
and gave its name to the Girl Guides   
district.
