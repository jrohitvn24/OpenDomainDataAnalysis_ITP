		<title>07HISTORY IN HALLATON TODAY 1</title>
		<content>  Hallaton is a picturesque village    
 with many signs of its long history   
 still visible. It is mentioned in the 
 Domesday Book as Heleton or Aleton.   
 Perhaps the oldest place is Castle    
 Hill, the site of a motte and bailey  
 castle, which probably formed the     
 centre of the estate owned by Geoffrey
 Alselin as described in Domesday.     
  The village is compactly built with  
 church, manor houses and farms centred
 round the Market Place or The Cross as
 it is known. On the Cross is a heavily
 built conical structure, possibly 500 
 years old called the Butter Cross from
 where dairy produce was served on     
 market days. It was here where the    
 weekly markets took place and the     
 twice-yearly five day fair, one of the
 largest fairs in the country. The     
 Cross is still the "centre" of the    
 village.                              </content>
