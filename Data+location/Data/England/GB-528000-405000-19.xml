		<title>19HUMBERSTON PARISH COUNCIL</title>
		<content> The Parish Council consists of twelve 
 members who are concerned with local  
 affairs. Some members serve on the    
 Governing Bodies of local schools. One
 councillor is a member of one Road    
 Safety Committee. The business of the 
 parish council is often mundane but   
 occasionally issues arise which arouse
 public interest. In 1985 a plan was   
 put forward to establish a Private    
 Nursing Home in a residential road.   
 This was bitterly opposed. The parish 
 council was deeply involved in        
 representing the views of the village.
 There is,also,divided opinion about   
 the extension of Wendover Hall,much   
 used by local groups. The             
 re-establishment of the Village       
 Horticultural Show has highlighted the
 need for larger premises. The parish  
 council are involved in this issue.
