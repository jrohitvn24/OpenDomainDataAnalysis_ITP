		<content> The nearest Magistrate's Court is at  
 Mark Cross, in the parish of Rother_  
 field.A local doctor is a Justice of  
 the Peace there and he plays an       
 important role in law and hopefully   
 deters further crime.The most common  
 offences are careless driving and     
 speeding, but assault, theft and other
 motoring offences are also dealt with.
 The age range of most people tried is 
 between 19 &amp; 20 _ 50% of these are    
 unemployed.Really bad offences are    
 referred to the High Courts in larger 
 towns where they are tried by a jury. 
 About 80 crimes are detected each week
 by the Police working 8 hour shifts   
 daily. Their beat covers 215 sq. miles
 which is manned by 21 in Crowborough &amp;
 1 in Rotherfield.Crowborough Police   
 Station was built in 1909.A traffic   
 warden operates in Crowborough between
 8a.m._6p.m daily except Sunday.       </content>
