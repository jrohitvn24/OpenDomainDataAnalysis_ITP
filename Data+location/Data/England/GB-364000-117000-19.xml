		<content>{TAPPS}_ THIS FINE EXAMPLE OF VICTORIAN
 ARCHITECTURE WAS BUILT JUST OVER 115  
 YEARS AGO AS A HOME FOR  HERBERT JAMES
 MEDLYCOTT, THE VICAR.THE NEW LARGE    
 VICARAGE WAS NEEDED TO ACCOMMODATE HIS
 EVER_INCREASING FAMILY AT THE SAME    
 TIME ENABLING THE PREVIOUS VICARAGE TO
 BE DEMOLISHED TO MAKE WAY FOR THE     
 EXTENSION TO THE CHURCH.              
{TAPPS}REMAINED THE VICARAGE UNTIL THE 
 MID_THIRTIES WHEN THE CURRENT VICARAGE
 WAS BUILT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE    
 STREAM,NEARER TO THE CHURCH.THE HOUSE 
 WAS PURCHASED BY THE HON MRS BRAMWELL 
 ,WHO LIVED HERE FOR OVER 20 YEARS.    
 THE ORIGINAL CARRIAGE ENTRANCE CAN    
 STILL BE SEEN ON THE{NORTH  BOUNDARY.}
 IT BECAME ESSENTIAL TO CLOSE THIS AS  
 THE{A30}DEVELOPED INTO A MAJOR TRUNK  
 ROAD FOR HOLIDAY MAKERS GOING TO DEVON
 AND  CORNWALL.IT IS NOW USED AS A     
 HOTEL,RESTAURANT AND NIGHT CLUB.      </content>
