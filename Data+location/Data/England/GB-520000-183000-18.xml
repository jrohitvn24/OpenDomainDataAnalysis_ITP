		<title>18THE HIGH ROAD WILLESDEN GRN</title>
		<content>{Willesden High Road}offers much to the
 local community. A large supermarket  
 should open this summer (1985). Apart 
 from that there are only small ones.  
 The road contains many small shops    
 which act as tobacconists and grocers,
 many open until quite late. The       
 greengrocers have a vast selection of 
 vegetables and fruits reflecting      
{diverse cultural backgrounds.}Take    
 away food shops and restaurants cater 
 for every taste and make up a good    
 percentage of the High Road traders.  
 Most of the major banks are here, as  
 are the building societies  and the   
 borough's{central library}which at    
 present is undergoing redevelopment.  
 The Police Station and Post Office are
 also on the High Road.                
 The{major problem}is the level of     
{traffic.}This is heavy throughout the 
 day leading to many delays.           </content>
