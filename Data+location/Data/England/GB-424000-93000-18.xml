		<content> With our block being an important     
 tourist and retirement area, shops and
 Post Offices provide a very important 
 service. Our local sub-Post Office    
 performs many different services.It   
 sells stamps, pays out pensions, takes
 payment of T.V. licences, electricity 
 and gas bills, provides a banking     
 service , sells budget stamps of many 
 sorts to help pay bills, and Postal   
 Orders so that money can be sent      
 through the post.                     
 Supermarkets are important for food   
 shopping for both tourists and        
 residents. There are four main        
 supermarkets in New Milton, Safeway,  
 Co-op, International and Shoppers     
 Paradise. We compared the prices of an
 average shopping basket for the four  
 shops and found the prices very much  
 the same, about Â£25.
