		<content>    When it comes to sport the area has
 some of almost everything. Whilst it  
 is first a rugby stronghold, in winter
 both soccer and hockey have many      
 followers and in summer the cricket   
 club is progressive and strong. There 
 is an outdoor swimming pool which is  
 well used though everyone yearns for  
 an indoor one. Bowls, tennis, golf and
 yacht clubs have been active for many 
 years.                                
    Indoors, a new sports hall has     
 given opportunities for badminton,    
 squash, netball, basketball, indoor   
 cricket nets, indoor soccer and even  
 archery. Another centre provides for  
 boxing, judo and keep fit classes and 
 a snooker hall gives enjoyment of this
 very popular pastime.                 
    With many anglers using the well   
 stocked lake in the Trust grounds     
 there is recreation for all tastes.   </content>
