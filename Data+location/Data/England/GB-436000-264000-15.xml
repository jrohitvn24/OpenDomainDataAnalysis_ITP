		<title>15COUNTRY LIFE-CHRIS (RETIRED)</title>
		<content>{  Chris and Mary}live in a cottage    
 approached across a field track off a 
 country lane.  From their garden they 
 have extensive views beyond{Leamington
 right to the{Malvern Hills.           
   There is no nearby Bus service so a 
 car is essential especially as nearest
 shops are in{Leamington or Southam.   
   Although they have retired, Chris   
 and Mary lead busy lives. Chris is    
 skilled in electrical and woodwork and
 is often requested  to help the local 
 farmer with problems.                 
   Mary enjoys creating fashionable    
 knitwear for her daughter who is a    
 beautician.                           
   Chris's hobby is wood carving.  He  
 has beautiful samples of his work     
 around the house and is now starting  
 to make a carved fire surround.       
{  Both enjoy the country, and would   
{not like to change their way of life. </content>
