		<title>16Thornton Gala</title>
		<content> The Thornton Gala happens in May every
 year. All the fun of a fair is there  
 and a lot of people from the local    
 area come on the day. There are BMX   
 riding and bands playing. A May Queen 
 and attendants are chosen every year. 
 There are many stalls and ice_cream   
 vans. You can win a football and you  
 can get your hair sprayed different   
 colours. You can get candy_floss and  
 teddies. Before the gala starts there 
 is a parade of floats all decorated by
 different groups or single people.    
 Several winners are chosen.           
                                       
 Around the time of the gala is the    
 Thornton Festival. This is an evening 
 of entertainment provided by the local
 school choirs and musicians. Winners  
 of several 'knock_out' competitions in
 the village play at this event.
