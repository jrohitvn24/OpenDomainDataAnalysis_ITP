 West Bowers Farm concentrates on dairy
 farming and the main produce is milk. 
 Each cow on the farm gives about 5000 
 litres of milk a year.The milk was    
 sold locally but now it is sold to the
 Milk Marketing Board.                 
   The milking procedure for the cows  
 is simple but effective.Before        
 entering the milking parlour the cows 
 gather in the collecting yard.They are
 then hearded into stalls where they   
 are milked by machine.Using this      
 method the farmer can milk 80 cows in 
 one hour.                             
   The main breed of cow on the farm is
 the Fresian,although there are some   
 cross-breeds.They are fed on cow cake,
 pellets and hay in the winter and     
 these plus grass for the rest of the  
 year.This food contains all that a cow
 needs to make it stong and healthy.   </content>
