		<title>20A DAY IN MY LIFE(CONTINUED)</title>
		<content> went to town we went all over         
 wondering what to get.Dad left us so  
 he could do the food shopping.Mum     
 bought some plants and David bought a 
 record.We had some lunch at Macdonalds
 and then I went to Miss Selfridge to  
 get some jewellery.Then we caught the 
 bus home.When we got home the phone   
 was ringing so we quickly opened the  
 door and I answered it.It was one of  
 David's friends seeing if he could    
 play.David did and played until 7.00pm
 because we had dinner at 7.30pm.We had
 fish and chips.While we were having   
 dinner,my uncle and cousin came.I     
 hurried to finish my dinner so I could
 play with my cousin.They went home at 
 8.30pm so they could be home for      
 Dynasty.We watched it too and when it 
 had finished we played Monopoly, and  
 Mum won.At 11.50pm I washed,cleaned my
 teeth,read a book and went to bed.    </content>
