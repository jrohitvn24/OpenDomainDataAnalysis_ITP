		<content>     Our map section covers part of    
east Northamptonshire, it is a typical 
example of this part of the county. It 
is mostly farming land (parts of which 
are reclaimed mining land) dotted with 
small towns. On our map we have a      
small town called Irthlingborough      
which has a population of 5,500 and in 
the north east of our map there is a   
corner of Finedon which has a          
population of 4,500. The A6 goes from  
London to Carlisle and crosses our     
section from south east to north west. 
The river Nene flows across the south  
west corner of our region on its       
journey to the Wash near Kings Lynn.   
The land is rich with iron ore and has 
been mined since Roman times.
