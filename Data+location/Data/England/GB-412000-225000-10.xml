		<title>10Quarrying Cotswold Stone (1)</title>
		<content> Huntsman Quarrry, started 50 years ago
 by a farming family who needed stone  
 for their buildings and walls, now    
 covers 50 hectares. There is enough   
 stone left for another 30-40 years.   
 The stone is sedimentary rock of the  
 Jurassic series. There is one metre of
 stone made with minute shells. This is
 ground and used for limestone on the  
 fields to adjust the acidity of the   
 soil. Below that is 4 metres of       
 Silicious limestone which is a hard   
 stone ideal for road-building and     
 bedding pipes. 2000 tons per day of   
 this crushed stone, called fines, was 
 being despatched as bedding for the   
 lead-free petrol pipeline being       
 constructed locally as part of a trunk
 line from Southampton-Wolverhampton.
