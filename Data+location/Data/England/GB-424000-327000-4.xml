		<title>04A TYPICAL DAY</title>
		<content> A typical day for me would be to get  
 up at 7.45 brush my teeth and wash my 
 face then I get dressed and go        
 downstairs at about 8.00 for my       
 breakfast. I normally have bacon      
 friedbread and a drink of water. At   
 8.45 I go and call for my freind. Then
 we walk to school together. At 9.00 I 
 go into school I spend the morning    
 doing Maths and English, at 10.30 we  
 have a playtime. I play with my friend
 Vicky. We play join up stag which is  
 when one person is on and when they   
 tig someone they have to join on to   
 the person who is on. At 12.00 we have
 dinner we usually have chips, beans   
 and sausage roll. At 1.30 we go in and
 we get changed for games.             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
