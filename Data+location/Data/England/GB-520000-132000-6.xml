		<content> Stickbacks, eels, carp bream even     
 brown trouta are to be found. If not  
 caught amongst other types. Even      
 Gudgeon, usually a river fish are in  
 one large hammer pond. It is          
 suggested they were introduced as live
 bait for pike and remainder released  
 at end of day. A pair of swans nested 
 in one hammer pond one year. Bird life
 varies a lot with large variety of    
 habitants, water, heavily wooded      
 areas, mature deciduous woodland      
 conifer plantations, scrubb areas     
 awaiting replanting and surrounding   
 open farmland.                        
 A good cross section of birds, with   
 summer visitors like the Cuckoo and   
 winter visitors like Pochards Kestrels
 nest but hunt on farmland with rare   
 Barn Owl. Attractive Mandarin ducks   
 havebeen nesting on pond of late and  
 gulls have been visiting too.         </content>
