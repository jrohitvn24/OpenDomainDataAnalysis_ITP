<title>21A day in the life of an adult</title>
<content>

I wrote the "A schoolboy's day,Paulton."  for D-block GB-364000-156000 back when I must have been about twelve years old. My brother sent the link to me this morning and I can still remember typing in the text to the computer in the classroom of Paulton Junior School. I did fullfil my ambition of selling a computer game to a publisher (manufactuer as I wrote back then) and worked on several games over the years. Although I've moved away from Paulton and now live in Singapore I still watch the new episodes of Doctor Who when I can. I had to explain to my wife what "Wonder woman" and the Domesday project was all about which brought plenty of old memories. I hope when our baby daughter is old old enough to be in school the BBC Domesday project is still archived somewhere so she can see a little of what life was like when I was a similar age.&lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
