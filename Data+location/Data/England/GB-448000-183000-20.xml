		<content> The Ridgeway,designated in 1972 as the
7th. of the Countryside Commission's   
long distance routes, passes through   
the south-west corner of this block as 
it makes its way the 85 miles from     
Avebury in Wiltshire to Ivinghoe Beacon
in Buckinghamshire.Crossing the A34    
above Gore Hill,this part of the path  
affords fine views of the Downs and of 
the smoking towers of Didcot power     
station.                               
          --------------------         
 The Didcot to Southampton railway was 
started in 1876 and opened by Elizabeth
Catherine, Countess of Caernarfon in   
1878 at a cost of 397,484 pounds. The  
trains, running on a single track line,
were passenger and cargo.A second track
was built by the Americans for         
war-time transportation.As part of Lord
Beeching's cuts in 1964, the line was  
closed.                                </content>
