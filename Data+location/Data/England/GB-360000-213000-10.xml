		<title>10SHOPPING IN LYDBROOK</title>
		<content> Lydbrook has a post office,a          
 supermarket,a general stores,two      
 butchers,a woolshop,a stripped pine   
 furniture specialist,a second hand    
 furniture shop and a                  
 hairdressers.Lydbrook recently lost   
 its chemist shop.Several mobile vans  
 boost the shopping facilities.This    
 provision does not cover all needs.   
 Shopping habits are changing and less 
 is done locally. The majority of      
 families do one large weekly or       
 fortnightly shop in the nearest town. 
 Weekly markets are now held at        
 Cinderford and Coleford for which free
 transport is provided.The local bus   
 company provides a bus on Friday      
 evenings to Lydney where Kwiksave is a
 popular supermarket.In August another 
 branch opened in Coleford so the      
 Lydney bus may be discontinued.
