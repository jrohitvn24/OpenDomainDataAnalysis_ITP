		<title>06Astley Vineyards The Crundel</title>
		<content>{by Helen Davis                        
 Vineyards introduced to the Severn    
 Valley  by the Romans are mentioned in
 the Domesday Book.The Crundel, a steep
 south facing sandstone slope at Astley
 known as the vineyard,probably served 
 the nearby Benedictine priory which   
 existed until the reign of Henry V.On 
 this site off Crundels lane Michael   
 and Betty Bache reintroduced the vine 
 in 1971.After 7 years of experimenting
 with different varieties three proved 
 suitable for the soil, position and   
 climate.Muller Turgau, Madeleine      
 Angevine and Huxelrebe Kerner is      
 another grape grown there. In 1929 to 
 1980 this Vineyard was expanded to    
 include the adjoining 4.5 acres.      
 Astley Vineyards have their own       
 fermenting tanks at the Three Choirs  
 Vineyard in Glos. where the process is
 completed.                            </content>
