		<title>11RELIGION IN BUTTERLEIGH</title>
		<content>    In Butterleigh village there is a  
 Parish Church.There used to be a      
 Methodist Chapel but it has now been  
 converted to a private house (Capel   
 Cottage).Baptists and Roman Catholics 
 have to travel to Tiverton or         
 Cullompton on Sundays for their       
 Services.                             
    {ST.MATTHEW'S CHURCH}              
    The font dates from the 12th       
 century.The church was rebuilt in the 
 14th century and again in the 17th    
 century.                              
    Inside there is a board showing    
 names of Rectors,starting with 1277   
 when{Sir William De Frankehille}      
 became Rector.There is also an 18th   
 century {poor box}.                   
   The church hasn't got its own vicar 
 so the vicar of Silverton takes one   
 service a week on Sunday.The two      
 parishes share a Parish Newsletter.   </content>
