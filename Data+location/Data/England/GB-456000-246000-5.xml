		<content> Local farmhouses &amp; buildings are a    
 mixture of traditional Hornton stone &amp;
 bricks.  With a large number of       
 springs &amp; the watershed close to the  
 surface the land is heavy &amp; drainage -
 most recently of the Mole type - is   
 necessary to improve quality.  The    
 main crops are arable with wheat &amp;    
 barley predominant.  Grass is sown for
 winter stores of hay &amp; silage.  Farm  
 equipment is varied, some very much   
 specialised, &amp; mostly farmer-owned but
 some contractors go from farm to farm.
 On the farm the most usual fuel is    
 Diesel Oil for both transport &amp; other 
 machinery including Grain Driers.     
 Dairy cattle with cows averaging      
 between 4000 &amp; 6500 litres of milk per
 lactation are grazed outside in the   
 summer, inside in the winter &amp; fed on 
 silage with suitable additives year-  
 round for maximum yield.              </content>
