		<title>03PIT CLOSURE AT WORSBROUGH</title>
		<content>  The men who were interviewed were    
 sorry the pit had to close.  Most of  
 them had worked there a long time.    
 Everyone at{Barrow}had got on well    
 together.  It had been a friendly     
 place. Now some have been given jobs  
 at{Barnsley Main Colliery},but they do
 not like having to travel further to  
 work.  They are pleased to still have 
 a job though.  Others have had to take
 early retirement as they did not need 
 as many men at Barnsley Main.  In a   
 couple of months nobody will be left  
 at Barrow, it will have closed        
 altogether to be turned into a golf   
 course.  The miners thought that this 
 will be as good a use as any for the  
 land and it will bring a lot of       
 pleasure to the people of Birdwell    
 and Worsbrough.
