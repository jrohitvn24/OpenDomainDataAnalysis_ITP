		<title>17MANOR FARM_DAIRY COWS.</title>
		<content> The 92 cows on the farm at present    
 each produce about 40 litres of milk  
 each day.Under the Common Market quota
 scheme,Mr.Richards is only allowed to 
 produce 500,000 litres per year.Grass 
 apart,they are fed on silage (70lbs a 
 day), maize and BOCM concentrate eaten
 at milking time.                      
    The cows are milked twice a day,ten
 at a time in the herringbone parlour.A
 cow's milking life is about 10 years. 
 They are then sold for slaughter for  
 Â£20.                                  
    Manor Farm has no bull of its own. 
 The heifers are either artificially   
 inseminated or are served by a bull   
 hired for 9 weeks at a cost of Â£10 per
 week.                                 
    Milk is collected by tanker and    
 delivered to a local dairy.
