  It is really quite incredible to     
record the number of changes there have
been in the farms of this area in the  
last forty years.In those days there   
were nearly twenty small farms,mostly  
dairy and all with very little         
mechanical equipment.The farms were    
much smaller than today's average of   
700 acres.Ten years ago there were     
eleven farms.Today there are only      
four!The area farmed has decreased by  
30% due to housing                     
development,especially Peachcroft      
estate.Even this year another 100      
acres is being built on for the new    
Long Furlong estate at Lodge Hill.     
The four remaining farms are Blagrove  
(600 acres),Peachcroft(835 acres)      
Starveal(little more than a small      
holding) and Dunmore Farm (300         
acres)which is now up for sale.        </content>
