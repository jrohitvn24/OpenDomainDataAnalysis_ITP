		<content>   The farm has three combine          
 harvesters sharing the amount of      
 arable farm worked.  There are also   
 14-15 tractors.  The farm extends over
 a large area of the grid and Mr. Scott
 also owns two farms in Ludlow and     
 Leominster, the Scotts being a strong 
 farming family.                       
   There are numerous farm buildings   
 for storage etc.  A gazebo is also    
 near, giving views of the Wrekin.     
 Owing to inadequate shopping          
 facilities, all puchases have to be   
 made outside the district.            
   The house itself is a mixture of    
 styles, having originally been two    
 houses. It is mainly built of         
 sandstone.
