		<content> At a carnival people dress up and have
 great fun making up floats and        
 learning where they should stand.They 
 also collect money for different      
 appeals like schools,lifeboats        
 or cancer research.It is a lot of fun 
 watching them go by as well as being  
 in it. There used to be a carnival in 
 Sutton some years ago but it was      
 decided not to have one one year then 
 recently they reintroduced it and now 
 have one every year.{Mr Ash}has been  
 chairman of the committee.We found out
 that he hires most of his costumes    
 from{Skegness}but he makes his own as 
 well.{Mr Ash}has been chairman for 2  
 years.He said that the parade is the  
 best part and he likes the most.      
 Everyone who is in the carnival gets a
 medallion to keep.
