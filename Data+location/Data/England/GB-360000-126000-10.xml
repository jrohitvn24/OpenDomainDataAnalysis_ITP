		<content> During "Planet of the Apes" we stopped
 to have some lunch.For the rest of the
 afternoon we watched Live Aid.Then Mum
 told us to come and have a look at the
 hot-air balloon flying over us it was 
 red and white.We had a barbecue tea   
 and watched Live Aid.Then we went to  
 bed.                                  
  Live Aid was a special world-wide    
 T.V. programme to raise money for     
 people that are starving because of   
 lack of food and water such as        
 Ethiopians.The programme lasted for 16
 hours and is the first of its kind.So 
 far they have raised over 40 million  
 pounds.                               
           SATURDAY WITH MUM.          
 I woke up about half past seven so did
 mum. Mum and I got all the  hair-     
 dressing kit ready it was about half  
 past eight. So we put the hair-       
 dressing kit in the car and set off.  </content>
