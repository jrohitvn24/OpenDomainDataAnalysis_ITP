		<content> OIL EXPLORATION in Iden Green.        
    July 20, 1983, Conoco UK was       
 awarded the right to search for oil in
 this area. After preliminary echo     
 sounding Moor Wood (814315) was       
 thought geologically likely to yield  
 hydrocarbons and planning permission  
 for an exploratory bore hole was      
 sought.                               
    Such exploration and the           
 possibility of finding deposits worth 
 exploiting created serious concern    
 among some residents, particularly    
 those in the immediate vicinity.      
    A pressure group - Benenden Society
 was formed to fight this.Meetings were
 held by them - Parish Council,KCC,    
 Planning Committees. Permission was   
 granted - 26 conditions to safeguard  
 environment and safety.  Exploration  
 ran from September - November 1985.   
 No deposits found and land restored.  </content>
