		<title>08BIOGRAPHY-BERKELEY FAMILY</title>
		<content>{SPETCHLEY} Rowland Berkeley settled in
 Worcester in 1574 where he set up as a
 wool merchant and clothier. He bought 
 Spetchley Park from Philip Sheldon for
 Â£1400 in 1606 for his son Robert. Sir 
 Robert fought in the Battle of        
 Worcester and was sent to the Tower of
 London. Sir Robert was a keen         
 horticulturalist and planted many of  
 the species in the Gardens. The       
 original Hall was destroyed by Scots  
 Royalists to stop Cromwell using it as
 a base and so the family lived for 2  
 centuries in the converted stable     
 blocks. A later Berkeley was Sheriff  
 of Worcester and founded the Berkeley 
 Hospital Almshouses  there. In        
{1942}the family tree was retraced and 
 the present owner's father was proven 
 to be the rightful owner.(The present 
 owners are{Mr and Mrs RGJ Berkeley of 
{Berkeley Castle, Gloucestershire)     </content>
