		<title>07Our Village In The Past.</title>
		<content> We have been studying maps of Esh     
 Winning and have discovered the       
 following important dates.The railway 
 was opened in 1857 and closed in 1963.
 Esh Winning shaft was sunk in 1859    
 and the colliery closed in 1968.The   
 Stag's Head (1868),Durham Road School 
 (1892),3 rows of houses around the pit
 (1896),Post Office(i1896),Co-op(1914),
 and the road from Esh Winning to      
 Waterhouses(1920) indicate how our    
 village has grown.In1871 there were   
 only 25 houses and some families were 
 living in huts.                       
  The most amazing fact about the 1856 
 map is that Esh Winning does not      
 exist.N.E.Railway(Deerness Valley     
 Branch),Waterhouses Colliery,a house  
 at Low Waterhouse,2 houses at         
 Newhouse, Flass Hall and the Roman    
 Road (Watling Street) are all that is 
 to be found on the 1856 map.          </content>
