 of leisure activities like            
 cubs,scouts,guides and brownies.      
 Uniforms are worn and useful skills   
 are practised and tested.Cubs and     
 Brownies are for 7 to 11 year olds    
 Scouts and Guides are for 11          
 to 15 year olds.There are two football
 pitches at Pilot Field.You can watch a
 game of football there.It costs Â£1.00 
 for adults and 50p for children.At the
 Broomgrove Centre,people between the  
 ages of 18 and 60 can play Bingo.There
 used to be a youth club and disco     
 there,but these had to close due to   
 lack of adult support and some trouble
 at the disco.At Bucks Hole Reservoir  
 you can fish for pike.At home,        
 computers,games and video films are   
 very popular forms of leisure
