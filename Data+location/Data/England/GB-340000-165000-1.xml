 shoe shop and newsagents.There are    
 also shops along the High Street at   
 both ends.On the outskirts there is   
 Cadbury Country Club.Here there is a  
 swimming pool,sauna,adventure         
 playground,bar and restaurant.Most    
 people work in Bristol because there  
 is no main industry in Yatton. There  
 is easy access to places like Bristol 
 because we have a railway line.Yatton 
 is very dependent on the railway.     
 There are several pubs where you can  
 get good food and drink.There is also 
 a church and some chapels.Yatton is a 
 quiet,friendly village.
