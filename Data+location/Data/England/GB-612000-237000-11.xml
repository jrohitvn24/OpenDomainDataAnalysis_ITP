    Opposite the church in the village 
of Tattingstone is a hospital.It is    
called St.Mary's.Many years ago in the 
mid 1700's it was a workhouse and in   
the small piece of land known as the   
wildlife sanctuary there are paupers   
graves .People would also go to St.    
Mary's if they were going to have a    
baby.                                  
    About 1947 the hospital was changed
into a National Health Hospital.Today  
it caters for chronically sick and old 
people.It has about 160 patients and   
doctors visit the hospital regularly.  
    For the local inhabitants of       
Tattingstone who have no full time     
doctors surgery a surgery is held in   
the hospital every 2nd and 4th         
Wednesday in the month at 2.30.At      
other times people have to go to the   
surgery at Holbrook.                   </content>
