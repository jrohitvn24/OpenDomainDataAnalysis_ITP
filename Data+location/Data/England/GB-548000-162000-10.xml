		<title>10The Village Church</title>
		<content> The village church is very important  
to Chelsfield although it has been cut 
off from the old village by the        
By-Pass.It was built in Norman times   
andhas old oak beams to hold up the    
roof.Class 2 went to visit the church  
and Mrs.Blatcher showed us around.     
 Mrs.Blatcher showed us where there    
used to be old Box Pews that used to   
have a stove in them to keep people    
warm in winter.The side chapel is where
they hold services when there are not  
many people there.                     
 In St.Martains there are many old     
records written on vellum,these are the
old registers.The church has a tower,it
quite new because it had to be mended  
when some bits fell off.The roof is    
made of slate tiles and the walls are  
made out of a Kentish flint.
