		<content>  {Ley Farm}is situated down a large   
 track with arable land on either side 
 of the lane. The house itself is very 
 old, probably about 1680's. It has    
 been vacant for some time and is in a 
 poor state of repair. Surrounding the 
 house is 7 acres of grassland. This is
 at present lying fallow. The new      
 owners of{Ley Farm}have only been in  
 residence four weeks (1/10/85). There 
 is a lot to be done. A new bathroom   
 and kitchen are being installed. The  
 present owners have plans to become   
 self-sufficient on their farm by      
 burning rubbish and straw and turning 
 it into methane gas. This will be     
 stored and later used via a generator 
 to produce light and heat. The        
 immediate grounds around the house    
 have been tidied and laid to lawn. The
 buildings are in a poor state but in  
 time this is to be put right.         </content>
