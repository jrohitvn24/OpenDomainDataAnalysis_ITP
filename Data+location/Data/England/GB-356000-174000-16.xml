		<content>  {Bristol Zoo} is on the edge of {    
{Clifton Down}. It was founded in 1836.
 The zoo has 12 acres of magnificent   
 grounds full of plants , animals and  
 many beautiful floral displays.       
 Altogether there are over 1000 species
 of mammals , birds and reptiles .     
  Every year , Bristol Zoo has more    
 than 1/2 million visitors . It costs  
 thousands of pounds to run the zoo    
 weekly .                              
   In the centre of the zoo there is a 
 delightful lake surrounded by trees . 
 Ther are several species of bird that 
 swim on the lake . Other attractions  
 include the white tigers and a brand  
 new reptile house and monkey enclosure
  Personally , we think Bristol Zoo is 
 a nice place for people of all ages , 
 and it makes a lovely day out for all 
 the family . We really enjoy going to 
 Bristol Zoo .                         </content>
