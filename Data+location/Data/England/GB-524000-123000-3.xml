{ Mr.&amp; Mrs.J.Hayward}have a vineyard on
 1acre of Lydhurst estate.Their wine is
 a{dry white}but they do not sell it.  
  Rock Lodge Vineyards from Scaynes    
 Hill pick their grapes and make the   
 wine for them.The number of bottles   
 varies according to the crop and the  
 weather.In 1984 they had 1,500 bottles
 but the previous year there weren't   
 enough grapes to employ the winemaker 
 and so they gave the crop away to a   
 local man who makes his own wine.     
  {Lydhust}has belonged to the{Haywards
 since{1939}and has 250 acres.They also
 keep a flock of Scotch Half-bred sheep</content>
