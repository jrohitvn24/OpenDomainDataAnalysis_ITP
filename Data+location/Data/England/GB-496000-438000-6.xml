		<title>06BISHOP BURTON GAS CONNECTION</title>
		<content> Research was undertaken to ascertain  
 whether the village was viable for the
{installation of natural gas by NEGAS. 
 There was a high demand for the       
 utility by the residents and further  
 investigation by the company confirmed
 the viability of the venture.  Other  
 nearby villages would also have       
 welcomed gas connection but plans were
 found to be not feasible.             
 Bishop Burton residents were canvassed
 individually, with 25% initially      
 enthusiastic.  But by November 1985   
 95% of households had been connected  
 to mains gas (needing 1400 metres of  
 pipe and costing Â£370 per household). 
 And nearly all of these people now    
 have fitted gas appliances  in their  
 homes.  Gas was not installed in      
 council houses or at the Agricultural 
 college. Despite this the project was 
 deemed successful by all involved.    </content>
