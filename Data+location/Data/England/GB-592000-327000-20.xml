		<title>20Farming Near Fakenham</title>
		<content> Farming in this area is mostly arable,
 though there is also dairy and beef   
 farming and a few sheep. The land is  
 fairly flat so fields can be large to 
 allow for the use of large machines.  
 This has also led to the destruction  
 of many hedges, which has in its turn 
 led to soil erosion, the eradication  
 of wildlife habitat and loss of       
 natural beauty. The main crops are    
 cereal, sugar beet and oil seed rape. 
 Pensthorpe is a soft fruit farm       
 (strawberries, raspberries and        
 gooseberries), and the owner is       
 creating a wild fowl reserve which    
 will soon be open to the public. The  
 farming creates a few full time jobs  
 and some seasonal work, plus work in  
 the related industries.
