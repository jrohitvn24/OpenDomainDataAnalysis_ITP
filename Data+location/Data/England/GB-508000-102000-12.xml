		<title>12HIGHDOWN HILL</title>
		<content>   Highdown Hill is situated north west
 of Worthing, approximately 2-5 minutes
 car ride from Goring.  It covers a    
 large expanse of land and is covered  
 by lots of people regularly.          
   In a survey carried out by          
 Durrington High School pupils this    
 information was found:                
   Most people were there for a dinner 
 break, for fresh air, for walking the 
 dog.                                  
   Only 20% infact lived out of the    
 local area i.e. more than 10 miles    
 from Goring.                          
   Over 90% travelled by car.          
   30% of the people asked visited more
 than once a week; 25% visited more    
 than once a month. The rest came a few
 times a year.                         
   Most people stayed for 1 or 2 hours.
