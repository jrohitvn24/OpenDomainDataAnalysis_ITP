		<title>16HAMPTON WATERWORKS</title>
		<content>   The Waterworks{came to Hampton}in   
 the{middle of the nineteenth century  
 because of the amount of pollution in 
 the Thames.  Dumped sewage was causing
 epidemics of typhoid and cholera.     
   Although the current took the waste 
 out to sea the tide brought it all    
 back in. {The taking of water from the
{Thames below Teddington Weir was      
{prohibited in 1852.                   
   In 1854 three London water companies
 transferred to Hampton.  They were the
{Grand junction Waterworks,}the        
{Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks}and 
 the{Middlesex Waterworks.} The site   
 was ideal for the land was flat,      
 little used and conveniently close to 
 London for pumping. {All three        
{buildings still stand today.
