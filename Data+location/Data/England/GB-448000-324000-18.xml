		<content>{BRITISH BULLDOG:}Any  number of people
 stand in a row facing who is "on".    
 The "on" person shouts the name of the
 person who is to cross. The named     
 person has to get to the other side.  
 If he does, the whole team joins      
 him.If he gets tackled  and is held   
 down the opponent says{British Bulldog
 1,2,3. Then he is "on" with the first 
 person.                               
{HOT RICE:}Everybody stands in a circle
 with their legs apart, someone drops  
 the ball and if it rolls through your 
 legs you are "on". The person who is  
 "on" can run with the ball until he   
 hits someone and then that person is  
 "on" too. He can now pass the ball to 
 his helper and the game carries on    
 until everyone is hit except one      
 person who is the winner. A person can
 defend himself by hitting the ball    
 away with a flat hand.                </content>
