		<title>03THE BATCHES</title>
		<content> The mine spoil-tips or "batches" are  
 an integral feature of the landscape. 
 Nearly every village in the area had  
 one or sometimes two pits working in  
 the heyday of the Somerset coalfield  
 and although the mine-workings and    
 surface buildings have almost totally 
 disappeared, the batches remain as a  
 distinct reminder of those days. Most 
 were planted with conifers, partly to 
 avoid offending the eye of the gentry 
 and also as a means of occupying      
 striking miners.                      
 The ecology is unique. Tips not tree  
 planted have a natural covering of    
 grass and scrub. They now support a   
 wealth of plant and animal life       
 which has adapted to the coal and     
 shale soil. There is now a real       
 danger that these batches will        
 disappear as concentrated farming     
 and building becomes necessary.       </content>
