 like a different job in the quarry he 
 said he would like to stay where he   
 is, as it is a very enjoyable job. He 
 earns about Â£130-Â£150 a week, on      
 average, and works more or less the   
 same hours every day. The weather does
 not affect his work.

 35-40 tons and can carry 10 tons of
