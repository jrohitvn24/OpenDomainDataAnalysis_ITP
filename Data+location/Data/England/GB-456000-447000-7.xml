		<content> The main Edinburgh to London railway  
 lines pass through the area and is    
 known as Chaloners Whin.This part of  
 the railway is featured in many of the
 railway enthusiasts books and         
 periodicals.                          
 There is a reasonable bus service to  
 and from York but it is restricted    
 after six thirty at night. Many       
 residents in the area have their own  
 car and since it is a fairly flat     
 terrain most people have a bicycle.
