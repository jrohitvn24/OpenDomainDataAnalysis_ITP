		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF AREA</title>
		<content>{Glacial deposits of boulder clay and  
{sand underlie the area.These form a   
{hummocky surface rising to 26m with   
{peat filled hollows. Much is covered  
{by housing. In the west are the more  
{recent suburbs of Blackpool.The major 
{development is around the old market  
{town of Poulton,an important shopping 
{centre.The majority of housing is     
{owner occupied and built since        
{1960.Housing has linked up the hamlets
{of Carleton and Hardhorn.A green wedge
{has been preserved between Poulton and
{Blackpool. Much is grassland for      
{dairying but some is used for         
{cemeteries and playing fields.A few   
{small vestiges of woodland still      
{remain.There are two industrial       
{estates at Layton and to the East of  
{Poulton.The Blackpool-Preston railway 
{line has stations at Poulton and      
{Layton.                               </content>
