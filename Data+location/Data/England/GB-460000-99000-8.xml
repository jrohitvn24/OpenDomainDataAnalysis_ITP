		<title>08THE MARY ROSE</title>
		<content> A Visit to the Mary Rose.             
      Also in The Dockyard is another  
 interesting ship, the Mary Rose,      
 flagship of Henry VIII. It sank in    
 1545 because it was top heavy and     
 it was raised from the bed of The     
 Solent in 1982. You have to queue for 
 about half an hour. It costs          
 50p for children, Â£1 for adults or    
 Â£2.50 for a family ticket. There is a 
 galley way with lots of information   
 about the ship and at the entrance a  
 guide will meet you and take you to   
 the ship via an air lock. Inside there
 is a lot of noise because they are    
 building an observation platform. They
 are spraying the hull with fresh water
 to preserve it. They have now         
 succeeded in turning the hull into an 
 upright position. Later on they are   
 hoping to preserve it with a special  
 formula wax.                          </content>
