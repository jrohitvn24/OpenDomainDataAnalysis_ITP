		<content> In April 1984 the Bringsty Post       
 Office was closed at the old Office.  
 The new Post Office (Pool Cottage) is 
 about one mile away from the old Post 
 Office.There is a half day on Wednes- 
 day's and it is not open on Sunday.   
 There is an hour dinner break five    
 days a week.Thursday is the busiest   
 day of the week because lots of people
 come for their pension.It is very     
 hard to learn how to do Giros,stamps, 
 bus tickets,train tickets &amp; television
 stamps &amp; these are only some of the   
 trans-actions.After the Post office   
 has shut a daily account is           
 completed, on a Friday there is a     
 weekly account to do.Stamps,giros     
 television stamps &amp; dated taking      
 several hours.There are two letter    
 collections &amp; one delivery each day   
 exept Sunday's.
