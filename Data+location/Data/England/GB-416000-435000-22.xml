i live in bradford. i go to cavendish primary school. at home i play tig and hide and seek with my brothers.i also play with my toy figures. i play the guitar and learning brass. i dont go to the park that  much but  when i do i take my bike.&lt;br />&lt;br />i like my house and my frind is just round the corner. i dont like my house because it is near a main road and i cant get to my  friends house without getting watched.My school is very nice and we do lots of nice things.My favourite is PE or geograthy.I also like literacy and  Maths but I don't  like 5-a-Day.We go on some nice trips.I will soon be leaving to go to high school.   &lt;br />
