{SYSTEMS WHICH THEMSELVES CONNECT WITH 
{GOOD MOTORWAY SYSTEMS GIVING ACCESS TO

{USE FOR WHICH THEY WERE NOT DESIGNED. 
 OUR RAIL SYSTEMS ARE EXTERNAL TO THE

 TONBRIDGE TO READING LINE WHICH MEANS 
 CONNECTIONS CAN BE MADE TO LONDON VIA 
 REDHILL,READING&amp;TONBRIDGE. THIS LINE  
 ESCAPED THE "BEECHING" CUTS DUE TO THE
 POSSIBILITY OF A CHANNEL TUNNEL WHICH 
 IS STILL BEING TALKED ABOUT.
