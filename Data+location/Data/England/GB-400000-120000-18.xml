		<title>18ANGLICAN CHURCH: BOWERCHALKE</title>
		<content> Holy Trinity Church, of Norman origin,
 is centrally placed in Church Street, 
 the main thoroughfare. It also lies   
 immediately below 1 of the ancient    
 banks which comes off the scarp face  
 of Marleycombe Hill, where there is   
 evidence of an early Settlement. The  
 Church was restored &amp; further height  
 added to the tower in 1860. It has 3  
 bells rung for Services &amp; a good      
 striking clock wound twice weekly.    
 Services are conducted by a Vicar with
 assistance, as he is responsible for 6
 Churches - the Western Benefice of the
 Chalke Valley Group. The Services are 
 attended by up to 50 people,          
 especially the Family Service, when 15
 children may be present. Women assist 
 &amp; the 4th Sunday Service is organised 
 locally. Weddings, Baptisms &amp; Confirm-
 ations take place. Burials in the     
 graveyard are for all denominations.  </content>
