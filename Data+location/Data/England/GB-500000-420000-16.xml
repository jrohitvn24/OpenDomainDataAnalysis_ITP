		<title>16ST.PETER'S CHURCH</title>
		<content> This is almost certainly the church   
 mentioned in the Domesday Book of     
 1086, and it still retains its Saxon  
 tower. It was closed in 1971 and taken
 over by the Department of the         
 Environment. From 1978-1984 the       
 grounds were excavated by the         
 Humberside Archaeological Unit. It was
 discovered that layer upon layer of   
 churches had been built on the site.  
 Other interesting finds were some 10th
 century wooden coffins which had been 
 preserved by the wet ground, hundreds 
 of skeletons and several scaffolding  
 holes which have provided valuable    
 information about building techniques.
  Heating and lighting have recently   
 been installed inside the church, and 
 it is planned to open it to the public
 as an{ancient monument}in 1986.
