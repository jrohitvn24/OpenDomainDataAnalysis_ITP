		<title>11Farming in Whitsbury 2</title>
		<content> In the 1960's the stud farm produced  
 many outstanding horses including at  
 one time or another the winners of all
 five English Classics.The Whitsbury   
 yearlings have topped the{Newmarket } 
 sales often and, in 1984 10 yearlings 
 realized over Â£500000.There are       
 annually over 150 visiting mares and  
 their offspring, making the Stud a    
 very labour-intensive operation and   
 providing a good deal of local        
 employment. The present studs are{    
{Electric}and{Young Generation},one of 
 the best young sires at stud in this  
 country.Whitsbury estate can trace its
 racing stables back to the 1860's when
 a small number of National Hunt horses
 were trained here.From the 1930's it  
 gained recognition as a flat racing   
 stable.An essential feature of this   
 area are the grass gallops,a deep     
 cushion of turf on chalk downland.    </content>
