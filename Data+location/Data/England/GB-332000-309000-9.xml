		<title>09The A458</title>
		<content> The main A458 Welshpool to Shrewsbury 
 road dominates the northern part of   
 our square. The main traffic on our   
 roads are cars, lorries and vans.The  
 traffic travels at high speed through 
 the village.In the winter there is    
 less traffic because not so many      
 people want to travel on the roads    
 because of the weather.We did a survey
 on the 26 June and the second class   
 had done a survey in April and the    
 number of cars was different it was   
 more cars in April than in June.This  
 surprised us but the weather has been 
 very poor in 1985 when the council    
 alter the roads they seem to do it in 
 the summer which causes alot of       
 accident's and it holds the traffic   
 up.The most accident's are at Parry's 
 shop.This term for example a lorry    
 overturned and spilt tea-towels.There 
 are 2 well used garages on the A458.  </content>
