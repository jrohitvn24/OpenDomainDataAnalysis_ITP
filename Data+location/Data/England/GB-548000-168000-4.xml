was built it was an arable farm,which  
sold fruit and ready picked vegetables.
In 1959 the present owner bought the   
twenty-three acres of ground which the 
centre is set out on.There are sixty   
people working at the nursery. In the  
whole of the garden centre and nurserys
they only sell pot plants and beding.  
During the course of the year there are
thirty different types of plants grown.

The garden centre lets four other      
companies rent their land to sell fruit
and vegtables and garden items.Set in  
the middle of the centre is a shop     
which sells sweets,honey and jam.The   
centre sells direct to major stores    
especially in London where the centre
