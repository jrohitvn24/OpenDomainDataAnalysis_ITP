		<title>11A Small Housing Estate</title>
		<content>      I live in St. Lawrence in an     
 estate called Clos Des Ormes. Before  
 it was built it was a field. It was   
 built about thirteen to fourteen years
 ago. The estate has about forty       
 houses. There are about five houses   
 along the road which leads to the main
 road. It has a car park at the top and
 garages for nine houses, but most of  
 the houses have their garages next to 
 their house. It has ten houses in the 
 middle. My house has three bedrooms,  
 one bathroom upstairs. Downstairs we  
 have a dining room and a kitchen which
 is all in one with a work top in      
 between them and a lounge, boiler room
 with a little room with a basin and a 
 toilet. We have a patio, a garden and 
 a lawn with a flower bed around it.
