		<content>We met a Mr.Walters,who has worked on  
for many years.As a boy he missed a lot
of school when he acted as a           
{scarecrow} in the orchards from 4a.m. 
until evening.He later worked with     
{Hops},walking on stilts to string the 
poles and later to pick them in        
buckets.They were then taken to the    
{Oasthouse}to be dried for 8 Hours.They
were then stuffed in bags called       
{Pokes} before being sent to the       
brewery.He also picked cherries from 60
rung ladders because they were very    
tall.Today trees are cultivated that   
are very small,{Dwarf Trees},to  make  
picking easier.Many Cherry trees are   
being {grubbed out} because they are   
unprofitable.Many old varieties of     
fruit are vanishing,to be replaced by  
high yielding,disease resistant crops.
