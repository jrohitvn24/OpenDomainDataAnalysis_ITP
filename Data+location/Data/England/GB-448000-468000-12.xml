		<title>12The Railways</title>
		<content>                                       
 Today the only obvious evidence of    
 railways is the main East Coast line  
 with regular '125' trains running     
 almost north-south through the        
 area.Careful observation however      
 reveals much more. Beside Hag Lane    
 Bridge are a row of houses named      
 Station Cottages.If you look just to  
 their side there is the raised        
 platform which used to be Raskelf     
 station,which was built in 1841.Not   
 only was it used to transport goods to
 and from local farms by cart but there
 was a branch line going off to        
 Scarborough with trains every hour.A  
 mile or so to the east a raised hump  
 on Crankley Lane is evidence of a     
 level crossing and shows yet another  
 disused railway _ the York-Easingwold 
 line closed in the 1950's due to      
 competition from road haulage.        </content>
