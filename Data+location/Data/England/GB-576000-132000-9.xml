		<title>09BENENDEN WEALD, FOREST FARM.</title>
		<content> Forest Farm is almost in the centre of
 our block of grid squares and as the  
 farmer and his wife and family have a 
 long and close connection with our    
 school we asked them if we could visit
 the farm and study it as part of this 
 project. They took over the land when 
 he was de-mobilised in 1946 and we    
 particularly  wanted to know about the
 changes,  which are described on the  
 following pages.  The farm and their  
 family have grown and the two sons    
 with their wives and families play a  
 full part in  farm life. The farmer   
 lives in a bungalow which although    
 modern has the traditional open door  
 welcome to everyone and is the focus  
 of all their activities.  This farm   
 combines the characteristics of a     
 modern business very successfully with
 the traditional family farming way of 
 life.                                 </content>
