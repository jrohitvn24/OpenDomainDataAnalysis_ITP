		<title>02Christchurch Mansion Ipswich</title>
		<content>Christchurch Mansion is in Christchurch
park which is situated near Ipswich    
town centre.                           
The mansion was built on the site of   
the Augustinian Priory of the Holy     
Trinity for Edmund Withipoll in        
1548.After passing through many        
generations Felix Thornley Cobbold     
handed the historic building over to   
the Ipswich Corporation.Ipswich then   
turned it into a museum.So it is due   
to Felix's generosity that we can look 
round the mansion.The mansion has      
about 30 rooms each of which is set    
out to show various periods of         
history.The staircase and the hall are 
decorated with paintings.There is also 
an art gallery containing many famous  
paintings including some by John       
Constable.At one time Christchurch     
park was the garden of the mansion but 
it was handed over with the mansion.   </content>
