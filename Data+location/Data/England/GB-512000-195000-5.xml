		<content> The Electricity Transforming Station  
 is located in squares 05140197 and    
 05140196 and occupies an operational  
 site of 17 acres obtained by          
 compulsory purchase from Hillfield    
 Farm. A further 11 acres are leased   
 out to Patchetts Green Equestrian     
 Centre and might be developed in the  
 future. The station became operational
 in 1955 as part of a ring of plants   
 built, where space allowed, to        
 transform high voltage electricity    
 produced in the Midlands for domestic 
 use in London. The station was        
 intended to be operational for 25     
 years but new technology has extended 
 its useful life. It employs 8         
 qualified members of the Institute of 
 Electrical Engineers who supervise the
 plant, local lines and pylons, and    
 18 fitters who maintain the sight. It 
 is one of the areas uglier sights.    </content>
