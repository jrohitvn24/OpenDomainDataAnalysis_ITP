		<title>12LANGDON COURT</title>
		<content>{In 1066 according to Domesday Book,the
{owners of Langdon manor were the      
{Saxons Heche and Goda.}The next owner 
{was a Norman knight called Waldin.    
 Although it is only 6 miles from      
 Plymouth it could be 60 as the hotel  
 is surrounded by farms and woodland.It
 has{15 rooms to let all with private  
{bathroom and toilet,colour TV, tele-  
{phone and radio/alarm.}Mr and Mrs Cox 
 and Mrs Barnes run the hotel. In the  
{cellar}there is a{well}in which a WW2 
 loaded colt revolver was found.There  
 is also an entrance to{a secret pass- 
{age}there. Nobody has yet reached the 
 end of this.In Tudor times it was pro-
 bably used as an{escape tunnel,}or it 
 may have been a{drain.}We thought that
 it must have been used as a{hiding    
{place by smugglers.}For 300 years the 
{Calmady family}lived here(1570-1876). 
 The Langdon estates were sold in 1927.</content>
