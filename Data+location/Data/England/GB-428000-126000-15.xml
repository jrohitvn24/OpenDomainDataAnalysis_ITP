		<title>15Mr Musson,Blacksmith/Eng'eer</title>
		<content> Mr Musson brought a portable forge to 
 school and demonstrated the skills of 
 the blacksmith. The most important    
 tools were his hammer and anvil. He   
 showed us how to make a poker which   
 has a special hook on the end to      
 remove the clinker from the fire. He  
 uses special tar-free coal, mined in  
 Yorkshire. It heats evenly over a     
 wider area than household coal. Mr    
 Musson runs a small engineering firm  
 in Shirley, Southampton. His family   
 have always been blacksmiths but after
 the last war had the foresight to     
 adapt to this type of business rather 
 than change to a garage as did other  
 blacksmiths. Mr Mussons firm has just 
 completed an order for specialist     
 parts to help build new radio masts in
 the Falkland Islands.
