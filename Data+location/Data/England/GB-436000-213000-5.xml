		<content>In North Leigh there are seven farms.  
They are called Ashford Mill Farm,Holly
Court Farm,Bridewell Farm,Shakenoak    
farm,Field farm,Perrotts Hill Farm     
and the Field farm.At farms there      
are animals which give us food and     
drink,such as cows which give us milk  
and pigs which give us meat.Some farms 
sell eggs, milk and meat.Every morning 
the farmers have to get up early to    
feed the animals and to milk the       
cows.Most of the milk is taken away by 
lorries. Also the farmers have to grow 
grass to feed the animals and he has   
to grow vegetables,wheat,barley and    
corn.When the corn,wheat and the       
barley is ready, it is taken to the    
mills to be turned into flour. Then it 
is made into bread, cakes,buns and all 
sorts of things.
