		<title>09Hayes Carnival</title>
		<content>  The Hayes Carnival was on Saturday   
 13th July 1985 from 2pm. till         
 12 midnight. The procession left Hayes
 Stadium and went to Botwell Church.It 
 then went down Central Avenue on to   
 the Uxbridge Road to the Beck Theatre.
 From there it returned to the stadium.
 There was a fair with all different   
 kinds of rides and stalls.There were  
 stalls where if you picked an odd     
 number from a hat you won a prize,or  
 you could hook a duck and win a       
 poster.There were about thirty rides. 
 At night all their lights were        
 switched on and it was a wonderful    
 sight.Also there was a refreshment    
 tent and one for lost children.Ever   
 since I was small Ihave liked the     
 merry-go-round.
