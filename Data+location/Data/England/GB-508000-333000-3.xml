		<content> The main crops surrounding            
 Billingborough and Horbling are wheat,
 barley and oil seed rape. The minor   
 crops are sugar beet and vegetables. A
 small amount of grass is grown for hay
 and an even smaller amount for        
 grazing. Many of the crops are grown  
 for seed. There are two seed merchants
 in Billingborough who collect wheat   
 and barley seed locally and export it 
 through Boston docks.                 
  Stubble burning has become a major   
 cause of contention between the       
 farmers and other residents of the    
 area although there is now a move to  
 reduce burning and much stricter      
 controls have been introduced.        
 Motorists also object strongly to the 
 amount of mud left on the roads by    
 tractors coming off the fields.
