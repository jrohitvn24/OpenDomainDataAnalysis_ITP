		<content>   Sandwich is as old as British Urban 
Civilisation and shows clearly the     
continuity of this heritage and its    
evolution over more than a thousand    
years. The physical pattern of the     
original mediaeval town survives intact
and it contains buildings              
representative of the Middle Ages, and 
all historic periods since then.       
   Within the walled town 170 buildings
are on the statutory list of buildings 
of architectural or historic interest  
with 140 on the reserve list.          
   The numerous narrow and irregularly 
laid out streets of the old town are   
crammed with buildings of all shapes   
and sizes. Only in a few areas is the  
scale of development relatively large; 
mainly it is small and 'domestic'.     
Taken as a whole this kind of urban    
pattern is the most vulnerable to the  
pressures of modern traffic.           </content>
