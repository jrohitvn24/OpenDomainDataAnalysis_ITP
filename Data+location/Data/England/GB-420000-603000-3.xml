		<content> The ruins of Brainshaugh Priory lie   
 within a loop of the River Coquet at  
 Guyzance.The chapel dates from the    
 twelfth century and was built by      
 Richard Tison for the benefit of a    
 group of nuns from a religious        
 community in Alnwick.The chapel and   
 other buildings would have been small 
 and served the basic needs of the     
 community.The nuns farmed the land in 
 the area and had grazing rights in    
 various other parishes.               
 The chapel fell into disuse during the
 18th.century, although weddings       
 continued to be performed for many    
 years and burials took place until the
 19th.century.Today the chapel grounds 
 are used as the private burial ground 
 for the Milburn family of Brainshaugh 
 and Guyzance, the most recent being   
 that of Sir J.N.Milburn Bt.July 1985.
