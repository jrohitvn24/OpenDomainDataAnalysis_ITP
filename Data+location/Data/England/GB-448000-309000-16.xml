		<content> A Modern House.                       
 My house is quite big.It has got a    
 double garage.Upstairs it has got     
 three bedrooms and a bathroom.        
 Downstairs we have a kitchen,a hall,a 
 lounge and a dining room.It was built 
 by Fitchett in 1979.                  
 An Older House.                       
 My house was built in the last        
 century.A doctor lived and worked     
 there.It has a cellar which smells    
 damp.Home-made beer was kept in       
 it.There are bells for each room and  
 you ring for a maid-my mum!The house  
 has five bedrooms,two lounges,one     
 dining-room,one big kitchen,two       
 bathrooms and a big walk-in           
 cupboard.Outside it has a big garden  
 and some old-fashioned toilets.There  
 are two outhouses that we use for     
 gardening tools.
