		<title>06Visitors to Stanway House</title>
		<content> A survey was conducted in June of     
 visitors to{Stanway House}taking a    
 sample of 100 people .We found that 8 
 were local (ie. lived within a 20     
 mile radius); 13 were other day       
 visitors who came from as far as 80   
 miles away; 79 were holiday visitors  
 who were staying in the the locality  
 on holiday.{Broadway}was the most     
 popular choice for local              
 accommodation. 24 of the visitors were
 foreign with U.S.A. providing a       
 quarter of this number. Most of the   
 visitors gave an interest in historic 
 buildings as their reason for         
 visiting, although a number said they 
 just happened to be passing. In       
 describing the area words like,       
 beautiful, interesting, peaceful,     
 unspoilt, picturesque, and friendly   
 were used. Only one person            
 interviewed did not like the area.    </content>
