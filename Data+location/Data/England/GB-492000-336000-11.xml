		<title>11FARMING IN GRANTHAM</title>
		<content> The NE area under survey offers a     
 complete cross section through the    
 Witham Valley and its eastern slope   
 and divides into several distinct     
 farming landscapes. In the valley     
 bottom between Manthorpe and Belton   
 the low lying land is wet and in      
 places quite heavy. Pasture and       
 meadows are found here. On the valley 
 side sand and gravel terrace, near    
 Manthorpe, a market gardener has      
 established a small but popular       
 holding and also engages in contract  
 farm &amp; garden work. From Belton       
 village towards Londonthorpe and      
 Harrowby Hill the pasture is grazed by
 cattle and sheep. In places root crops
 and a few grains plus new crops like  
 rape, have been planted.On the        
 Harrowby estate there are some crops  
 grown under glass in the farmer's     
 nursery.                              </content>
