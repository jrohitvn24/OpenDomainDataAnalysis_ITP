		<title>09HEDGE SURVEY</title>
		<content> We all did an environmental project on
 hedges in our grid from the 1st       
 January-1st July 1985.Hedges are      
 useful boundary markers and wind      
 breaks.They provide a habitat for wild
 life on which we all depend.          
 Hedges in our grid compare with alot  
 of other areas,they are on the whole  
 neglected and over grown because of   
 the dying art of Laying a hedge.Only  
 Mr Ogbourne of Wanborough can now lay 
 a hedge properly.                     
 The hedge is alive and always changing
 each time we passed ours we noticed   
 something different                   
 buds,leaves,twigs,flowers,plants,anima
 ls,birds and insects.                 
 Birds use hedges as their territory   
 other birds come looking for a        
 mate.Nests abound and in winter the   
 hedge is a shelter and a source of    
 food.Likewise for animals and insects.</content>
