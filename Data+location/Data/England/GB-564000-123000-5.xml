		<content>    My{walk}to the Rec. is across the  
 fields I pass a very big and beautiful
 Oak tree it is about a hundred years  
 old, the hedge is prickly with haw-   
 thorn and blackberry brambles, hazel  
 too edges the over-grown pathway.     
    Here you will find camps and       
 trees, swings, a slide and a see-saw, 
 the cricket square, football pitches  
 in winter and a stoolball pitch in the
 summer. Teas are served to the players
 in the pavilion and there are changing
 rooms too.                            
    The young Farmer's hold an annual  
 barbecue and a Fete. We have our      
 School Sports Day in the Rec. when    
 Mums and Dads come to cheer us. If you
 walk a little further there is a bumpy
 patch that leads to where cars can be 
 parked.                               
    There is a round wood with lots of 
 different trees like Ash, Elm and Oak.</content>
