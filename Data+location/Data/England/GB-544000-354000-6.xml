		<title>06FRISKNEY HOUSING</title>
		<content> Just over half the homes are          
 owner-occupied, the rest being rented.
 About 2/3 of the rented accommodation 
 is owned by the Council. The remainder
 is private, Almshouses or Charity     
 Trust property. There are few         
 tied houses. Apart from 2 blocks of 2 
 story flats at Fold Hill homes are    
 houses or bungalows. About 60% of     
 these are detached. There are 3       
 derelict and 10 empty houses, 1       
 holiday home and 3 caravans. There is 
 a steady but small number of new homes
 being built using traditional methods 
 and materials. New bungalows are the  
 most popular. There is little         
 speculative building, most homes being
 built with a specific person in mind. 
 The age, type and condition of the    
 housing varies a great deal but a fair
 amount of repair, renovation and      
 modernisation is taking place.        </content>
