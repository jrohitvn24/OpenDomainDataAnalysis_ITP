		<content>{Hannah More Infants School,}on the    
 same site as Grove Junior School, was 
 built in 1970. It was named after{Miss
{Hannah More}who, with her sister, set 
 up many small schools in this part of 
 the country in the late 18th C., long 
 before the 1870 Education Act which   
 began "education for all children".   
 Hannah More set up a Sunday school in 
 Nailsea in 1791 near Holy Trinity     
 Church. This later became the         
 Nailsea Parochial School for children 
 from 5 to 14 years and then, when the 
 Grove and Hannah More Schools were    
 built, it became the Annexe to the    
 over-flowing Grove Junior School until
 1984. Now that old building is used by
 Social Services as a day centre for   
 handicapped people.                   
 Hannah More's first pupils were       
 children of 5 to 12 years who worked  
 in the local coalmines and glassworks.</content>
