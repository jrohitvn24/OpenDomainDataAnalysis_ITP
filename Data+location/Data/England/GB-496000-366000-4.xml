  {LIFE ON A NEW ESTATE                
 When we went to Bracebridge Heath we  
 went around the close off Main Avenue.
 We met an old lady who has been living
 at her house on the new estate for    
 nine weeks.She has arthritis so she   
 cannot walk very far.Her husband was  
 a pilot in the RAF.She said she was   
 used to the aeroplane noises from     
 nearby RAF Waddington because she had 
 always lived at or near an RAF camp.  
{    She spent most of her time}looking
 after her garden which was very pretty
 with lots of flowers in it. There are 
 no shops here so tradsesmen come round
 in vans selling potatoes,ice cream and
 vegetables .These goods are more      
 expensive than in the shops because   
 they have to pay for the petrol.
