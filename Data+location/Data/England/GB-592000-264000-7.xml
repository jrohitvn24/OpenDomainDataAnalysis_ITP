  ONE FAMILY'S DAY---PREPARATION       
  Preparations began with making       
costumes for the Friends of Thurston   
Primary School Float Â£Circus'.         
  On the Friday before the Fete we went
to Elm Farm to decorate the Float.The  
decorations had been made by the school
children,who had thoroughly enjoyed    
drawing clown faces and animals.       
  Saturday dawned bright and clear.The 
 children were very excited.We went to 
the field,where many people were       
setting up tents and stalls.           
  After lunch Christopher put on his   
clown suit and had his face made up.He 
at once began Â£clowning' around.Next   
James was costumed and made up.Then he 
pulled faces in the mirror.            
  Then it was mother's turn to get     
ready,complete with pink sprayed hair.
