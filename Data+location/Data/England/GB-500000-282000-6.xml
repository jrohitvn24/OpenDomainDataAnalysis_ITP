		<title>06LILFORD HALL</title>
		<content>{     The Hall is set in 240 acres of  
 rolling grassland and woodland and is 
 a listed Jacobean building of great   
 historical and architectural interest.
   It was built in 1635 and a further  
 wing added 21 years later. The stables
 and coach house, which now contain the
 gift shop and craft workshop, were    
 probably built in 1711 and it was also
 at that time that the spectacular row 
 of 13 chimneys was added. Between 1830
 and 1858, the east and west wings were
 extended, so that the deep U-shaped   
 appearance was formed.                
   It was originally built for one     
 William Elmes, but it passed into the 
 hands of Thomas Powys (whose          
 great-grandson was created the first  
 Lord Lilford in 1797) in 1711. With a 
 short break in recent years, it       
 has remained in Lilford hands ever    
 since.                                </content>
