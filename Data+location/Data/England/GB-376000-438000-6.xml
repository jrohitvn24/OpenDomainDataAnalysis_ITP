		<title>06FARMING IN SABDEN</title>
		<content> A typical farm in our D-Block could be
 said to be{Cobden Farm .Mrs Wright  } 
 gave us some details. The farm        
 occupies{95}acres and they have{55}   
 cows.These are dairy cattle for       
 producing milk. Besides the cows there
 are{260}sheep. The farmer usually     
 sells the bulls and the beef heifers  
 but keeps the dairy heifers. They have
 two tractors. They put fertilizer on  
 their land between May and June to    
 make the grass grow stronger.         
                                       
 They make silage but they have to make
 straw for feed and bedding.           
                                       
 On{Cobden Farm}there are no paid farm 
 labourers.They no longer keep pigs    
 because of the time involved.The farm 
 has been in the family for{40}years.
