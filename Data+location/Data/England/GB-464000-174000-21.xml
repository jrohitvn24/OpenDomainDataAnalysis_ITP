<title>21Tilehurst Station</title>
<content>

2011 update of our schools 1986 article. The ticket office did not know how many trains pass a day, however there are 2 sleeper trains and around 650 people through the station daily. It is a commuter station meaning it is mainly used by people going to work. Only 1 person works there. Most of the trains are through trains and do not stop at the station. A ticket to Wick now costs Â£338 1st class. Steam trains still go through the station on special services, the last was on 15th October 2011.   &lt;br />
