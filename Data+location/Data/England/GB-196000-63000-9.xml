		<content>  Our area is rich in{wildlife,plants  
{trees and creatures.}Farmers are      
 keenly aware of their privileged      
 position as guardians of our natural  
 heritage.Many small holding are not   
 economically viable and as a result   
 farmers are removing hedges and       
 combining small fields into more      
 workable units.Many of the fields on  
 the old parish map have disappeared   
 as have some of the farms and small   
 holdings.                             
  The farmers are creating areas for   
 wildlife by allowing some{corners of  
{fields}to remain undisturbed.{Ponds   
 have been deepened or created to      
 encourage aquatic creatures.The       
{woodlands}are well protected and the  
 area is relatively free of visitors   
 who could cause damage unknowingly.   
  A healthy balance between nature     
 conservation and economy is achieved. </content>
