		<title>03THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY</title>
		<content>    A 1st. year class at Toot Hill     
 School conducted a survey on the      
 Christian Community in Bingham. There 
 are four denominations: the Anglican, 
 Methodist, Roman Catholic and the     
 Olive Branch Christian Fellowship.    
    Congregations can be as large as   
 150, and more adults than children    
 attend church. The Anglicans form the 
 largest community. The different      
 demoninations cooperate a great deal. 
 The Roman Catholics use the Anglican  
 Parish church for their services.     
 Every denomination helps to run the   
 'Third World Shop' which raises money 
 for charity.                          
     The local community receives help 
 too. Each Sunday there is an Anglican 
 service at the Old Peoples' Home.     
 Sunday Schools flourish and there are 
 a variety of clubs for young people.
