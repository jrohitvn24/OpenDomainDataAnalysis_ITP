		<content>   The village of{Whalley}is surrounded
 in every direction by green fields and
 quite dense woodlands.                
   One mile to the north of Whalley    
 lies the tiny village of{Wiswell}     
 almost hidden from view by the        
 neighbouring{Spring Wood.             
{ }To the north-west lies the hospital 
 of{Calderstones,}established for the  
 care and training of the mentally     
 handicapped.                          
   Travelling south-westwards out of   
 Whalley you will pass through         
{Billington,}a residential area of     
 private and council housing estates.  
   Running almost north to south across
 the area and almost parallel to each  
 other are the{A59 (Liverpool/York)    
 trunk road, which now bypasses the    
 village, and the{Blackburn/Hellifield 
 railway line, crossing the impressive 
{Whalley Viaduct}with its 49 arches.   </content>
