 The Ray Estaes belonged to Sir Charles
 Parsons, who had a country mansion at 
 Ray. It ws demolished after the war.  
 he is buried at Kirkwhelpington. Sheep
 are the most obvious products of the  
 pasture, but some prefer grouse,      
 which is profitable. The hills can    
 be very attractive under the carpet   
 of heather, but the climate is        
 harsh.Blackhlls is the only farm in   
 the area. The in bye land provides for
 cattle and a little cultivation,but   
 sheep are predominant.                </content>
