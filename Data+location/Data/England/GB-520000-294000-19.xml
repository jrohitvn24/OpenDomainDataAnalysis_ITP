		<title>19Looking to the Future</title>
		<content>   Stanground and Farcet in 1985 are   
 stable communities at present         
 experiencing little change.There are  
 only a few new houses being built,and 
 there is no industial development.The 
 expanding city of{Peterborough}has not
 brought obvious changes to this       
 area,but has put much improved        
 facilities and opportunies for        
 employment within reach.It is         
 difficult to forsee any real changes  
 in the character and life-styles in   
 the near future.                      
                                       
   This work on Stanground and Farcet  
 was done during the Summer Term 1985  
 by a class of seven,eight and nine    
 year old children from Southfields    
 Junior School,Stanground.Assistance   
 was given by teachers, parents and    
 other adults wuth knowledge of the    
 area.                                 </content>
