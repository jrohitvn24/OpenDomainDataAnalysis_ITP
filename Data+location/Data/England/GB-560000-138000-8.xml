		<title>08TRAFFIC SURVEY</title>
		<content>{Transport, Trafffic Survey, Pembury.} 
 The survey was undertaken on three    
 occasions. Each session was 15        
 minutes long. The number of vehicles  
 were counted.                         
  On Monday morning it was quiet as the
 workers had gone. On Tuesday it was   
 busier, shoppers were out. Wednesday  
 afternoon was half day closing, but   
 was busy, school finished at 3.00pm.  
 and parents were picking up their     
 children.                             
  The A 21 is always busier than the   
 B 2015, with approximately twice the  
 amount of traffic on each occasion.   
 The A 21 had by far the greater number
 of lorries.                           
  The survey results are on page 12. It
 would be interesting to see if results
 are similar after the by-pass is      
 built.
