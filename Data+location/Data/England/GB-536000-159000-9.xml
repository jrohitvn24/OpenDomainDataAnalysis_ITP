		<content>I like New Addington because I have    
been brought up here.I moved into New  
Addington when I was six months        
old.When I was only three years old    
people offered to take me for a walk   
and I got to know everyone and when I  
was three and a half years old I went  
to playschool in St.Edwards church.I   
got a bit tired of it when I was four  
years old and a half,I did not want to 
go anymore and I started to cry and    
went home.When I was four and three    
quarters the council sent some leaflets
through that asked me what school I    
wished to go to.There was a big        
selection I went to Fairchildes        
Infants,and then Fairchildes Junior    
School,my next school will be Addington
High.Everything I could possibly want  
is in Addington,swing parks, swimming  
pools,fairs twice a year.If I had a    
choice I wouldn't move.                </content>
