 1. Rural area, farming predominates.

 3. Few facilities, Norwich 6 miles N. 
 4. Conservation areas, with commons.  
 5. Low unemployment.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
 The area is unspoilt and attractive.  
 Gently undulating, it has many wooded 
 areas with natural features such as   
 fords and ponds.                      
                                       
 Housing development over the years has
 been slight.  A variety of styles and 
 periods can be found.                 
                                       
 Travel is necessary for schooling and 
 most forms of employment, which makes 
 personal transport more essential than
 in urban areas.                       </content>
