      In June 1912, the School we know 
 as Choppington First School was       
 opened.  It was built of red bricks.  
 Seventy three years on it is like     
 this.  There are 5 classes, 5         
 teachers, 1 part time teacher, 1 head 
 teacher, an auxiliary and a secretary.
 We have a hall, a head teachers room, 
 1 staff room, 2 cloakrooms - 1 boys   
 and 1 girls.  We have a playing field 
 and 2 playgrounds.  This school takes 
 children from about 5 years old until 
 they go to the middle school at 9     
 years old.                            
      In class 1 we begin to read and  
 write and to count.  We play games,   
 sing, paint, and play with the sand   
 and water.  In classes 2,3,4, and 5   
 we add to our learning, preparing us  
  for the middle school.               </content>
