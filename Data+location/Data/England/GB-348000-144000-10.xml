		<title>10Mellifont Abbey</title>
		<content>  Mellifont Abbey today is a superb    
 private residential home for the      
 elderly at present owned by Mrs. Julie
 Shawe. The residents are well cared   
 for in pleasant surroundings. There is
 a 24-hour monitoring service and      
 intercoms and emergency alarms in all 
 rooms.                                
  The building itself is set in about  
 three acres of lawns and gardens. It  
 was built about l73O by Colonel Piers 
 who owned the manor of Wookey and the 
 adjoining estate and it stands on the 
 site of an earlier rectory house. The 
 building is impressive because the    
 West Front has a central tower and the
 top is surrounded by a parapet with   
 mock battlements. Colonel Piers named 
 it Mellifont Abbey and surrounded it  
 with gardens and fish ponds and       
 enclosed it by a high brick wall which
 still exists today.                   </content>
