		<content> gold.There was one memorial to the    
 rebuilding of the{Abbey}which was made
 of bronze.There are about seventy     
 monks living in the  Abbey.There is a 
 special balcony for the sick  and old 
 monks to watch the Abbey services.When
 the{Abbey}was rebuilt only six monks  
 were working on it at a time and only 
 one monk had,had experience of        
 building.The rebuilding went through  
 the First World War and nearly two    
 decades after that.

 bee-keeping.He has been doing this    
 since 1914,when he became ill.Before  
 that he was a stone-mason.
