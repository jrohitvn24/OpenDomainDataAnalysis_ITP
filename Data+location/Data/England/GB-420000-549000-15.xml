		<content> OUTDOOR GAMES.                        
 The sort of games we play are mostly  
 sports e.g. football and cricket.There
 are not many good places to play, we  
 always get chased off the grass near  
 houses in case we break windows.About 
 ten minutes away there is a place     
 called the Kings Head.There is a      
 running track and 4 football pitches. 
 Most of the girls play the old games  
 like skips and running games,such as  
 hide and seek or bulldog.             
 We spend about 3 hours every night    
 playing football or cricket.The girls 
 like rounders or tennis.              
 INDOOR GAMES.                         
 The most popular games are board games
 such as monopoly or cluedo,these are  
 played with dice.Lots of people in our
 class have computers.
