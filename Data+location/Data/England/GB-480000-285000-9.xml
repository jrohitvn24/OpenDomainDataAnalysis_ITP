		<title>09Stoke Albany - Houses</title>
		<content>   Stoke Albany is built around a      
crossroads. Four smaller lanes lead    
from  the Ashley Road.They are called  
Chapel Lane, Green Lane, Bottom Lane   
and Middle Lane. Most of the houses    
are old, but many have been recently   
renovated. Most houses in Stoke are    
expensive. They are nearly all large   
detached houses made of stone. Some    
are new but made to look old and fit   
in well with their surroundings. There 
is one pub and on the Ashley Road is   
the old Manor House. Middle Lane has   
mainly detached old houses. Many are   
Victorian and contain dormer windows.  
Chapel Lane is narrow and has no       
pavements, but the gardens are well    
kept. The houses are a mixture of      
semi-detached, detached and terraced.  
At the top of Bottom Lane are          
pebbledash houses. The row of council  
houses is pre-war.                     </content>
