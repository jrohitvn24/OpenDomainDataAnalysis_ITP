		<content> This area of Southminster comprises   
 mainly three bedroomed semi-detached  
 houses although there are a few larger
 houses and some bungalows. In the     
 District Plan mention is made of the  
 need for more small houses for the    
 elderly and also larger family homes. 
 Just under half of the houses have    
 been built within the last twenty     
 whilst a few are over 100 years old.  
 All the more modern houses are        
 constructed of brick with tiled roofs 
 though many of them have the brick    
 covered with pebble dash or paint.    
 None of the houses are made of stone  
 since this is not a naturial material 
 to Essex but many of the older houses 
 are made of traditional lap board and 
 have slate roofs. Recently there has  
 been a revival of                     
 pargetting.(decorated plasterwork)    
 There is very little thatch.          </content>
