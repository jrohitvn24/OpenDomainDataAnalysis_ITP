 discover the maximum about our leisure
 centre.  Out of 142 people who were   
 asked 63 were men and 79 were         
 women.The ages of the men ranged from 
 under 10 to over 65.The ages of the   
 women were the same.125 out of 142    
 people said that the pool was their   
 favourite facility. The next favourite
 was the squash followed by keep       
 fit,tennis,solarium and yoga.  The    
 most popular time was in the          
 morning.The majority of people using  
 the leisure centre came from          
 Launceston.Most people who answered   
 the questionnaire were  very pleased  
 with the pool and all the other       
 facilities, but some people were      
 displeased with the changing          
 facilities and wished they were better
