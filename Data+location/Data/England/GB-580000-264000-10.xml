		<title>10The A45 at Bury St. Edmunds</title>
		<content>  The A45 is a busy dual carriageway   
running from the A1 at St.Neots to     
Ipswich. The current M.P. for Bury St. 
Edmunds calls it "the highway to       
Europe".                               
  To the northwest of Bury St.Edmunds  
it passes through farmland within sight
of the railway which runs closely      
parallel to the south. There is a large
roundabout with an underpass, where    
minor roads to the villages of Westley 
and Fornham All Saints and a main road 
to Bury St. Edmunds leave the A45.     
  On Monday 8th July, a mid-morning    
traffic census of half-an-hour recorded
as travelling east:- 256 cars,80       
lorries, 37 vans, 2 coaches, 2         
motorcycles and 1 bicycle.             
  Travelling west were:- 225 cars, 79  
lorries, 57 vans, 5 coaches, 3         
motorcycles and 1 tractor.
