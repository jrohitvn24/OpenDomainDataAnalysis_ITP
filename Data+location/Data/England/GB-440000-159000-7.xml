		<content> Police Constable Maxwell is our local 
 police man. He covers the areas of    
 Highclere, Woolton Hill and East      
 End. The job involves protecting life,
 detecting crime and attending traffic 
 accidents. A person can join the      
 police force when he or she is        
 eighteen and a half years old. He has 
 twenty days holiday a year, he has a  
 motar cycle to help him. When the     
 policeman walks the beat he carries a 
 truncheon. He uses this to hit        
 criminals on the elbow. Policemen have
 to retire after thirty years service. 
 P.C.Maxwell told us some funny        
 stories. Here is one of them.         
 P.C.Maxwell went to a scene of an     
 accident. He discovered two cars up a 
 telegraph pole. The bottam car was    
 holding up the top car.
