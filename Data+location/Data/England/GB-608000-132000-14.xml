		<title>14Lympne Castle</title>
		<content>   Lympne Castle stands on high ground 
 near the site of the Roman Port,      
 Portus Lemanis; and ten centuries     
 later it was stone from the Roman fort
 that Lanfranc used to build both      
 Lympne Castle and the Church.         
   Most of the Castle dates from the   
 thirteenth century, but the building  
 has been adapted and altered by       
 successive owners over the centuries. 
 In the nineteenth century Sir Robert  
 Lorimer was commissioned to restore   
 it, but there followed a period of    
 neglect until the present owners, Mr  
 and Mrs Harry Margary spent many years
 restoring and repairing the fabric of 
 the Castle which is now their family  
 home.                                 
   The Castle is open to the public    
 from May to September.
