		<content> 2. Hurdle Making.  Mr. Davis was 15   
 when he started Hurdle making and he  
 likes making hurdles very much.  The  
 wood for hurdle making is ash and     
 hazel, while the wood for gates is    
 chestnut.  He has now been hurdle     
 making for 70 years.  Recently he     
 retired and now is content to potter  
 about in his garden.  He told us he   
 used to have a Ford car and it looked 
 like a tin box with four wheels.  It  
 has  two gears and a pedal, you put   
 your foot on the pedal for first gear 
 and then took your foot off for top   
 gear, it went no faster than 30 miles 
 per hour and the nick name for the car
 was Tin Lizzie.  If you wanted a car  
 it would cost you twenty pounds.  His 
 next car was a Morris that had three  
 gears.  This cost him One hundred and 
 Twenty pounds, it was much nicer.
