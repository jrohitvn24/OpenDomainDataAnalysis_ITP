		<title>11GOREY YOUTH CLUB</title>
		<content>    Gorey Youth-club looks to be quite 
 a big place on the outside, but inside
 it is quite small. As you walk into   
 the club there is a hall, not very    
 large, and only about 7 feet high. It 
 is L-shaped, and there is a small     
 canteen. Upstairs there is a snooker  
 table, a pool table, table-tennis and 
 darts. It is planned to build a disco 
 area in a space that is not used.     
    The club may not be big, but there 
 are also outdoor activities. Some     
 nights we go canoeing or absailing, or
 for a swim-barbeque at St. Ouen, and  
 once a year, generally in the Easter  
 holidays, we camp for a weekend at St.
 Aubin's Fort.                         
    There are about 20 in the senior   
 club, aged 13-18, with two leaders,   
 and the same number in the junior     
 club, aged 7-12, with three leaders.
