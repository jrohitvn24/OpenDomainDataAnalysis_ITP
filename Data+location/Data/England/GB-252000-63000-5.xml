{Bingo}in our village hall. Also we    
 have our own{Brownie Pack}which meet  
 every Tuesday in our school.Near      
 important occasions such as Christmas 
 or Easter we have a{Whist Drive,}     
 playing for a prize of a turkey or an 
 Easter egg. Fortnightly a{            
{Silver-thread club}meet in the village
 hall for a meal which they cook       
 themselves,and a chat.Every Thursday
