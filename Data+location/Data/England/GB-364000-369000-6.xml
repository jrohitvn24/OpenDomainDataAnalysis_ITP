		<content>   I'm woken by my clock-radio at      
 6.15am and I get up to have a shower. 
 I have my breakfast which dad has     
 already prepared and usually consists 
 of 2 bowls of cornflakes ad an orange.
  I then leave for the papershop to do 
 my paper round. It usually only takes 
 me 30 minutes.                        
   I get home at 7.45am and watch T.V. 
 or read a book until its time to go to
 school. I walk there with friends.    
 During the spring and summer term I   
 play tennis before lessons begin.     
 During games lessons I enjoy playing  
 football,rugby,gymnastics,tennis,     
 athletics,softball,cricket and        
 cross-country.                        
   Several days a week my mum and dad  
 are caught behind for a meeting at    
 school and I have to look after my    
 younger brother and sister.
