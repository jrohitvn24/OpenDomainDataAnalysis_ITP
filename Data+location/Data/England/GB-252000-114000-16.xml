		<title>16THE CHURCH AT BEAFORD</title>
		<content>   St. George's Church, Beaford is     
 built of stone, and consists of a     
 chancel, nave, south aisle, south     
 porch, vestry, and a bell tower on the
 west.  The tower, capped by a steeple,
 was erected in 1910, and contains 6   
 bells.  The font is ancient and there 
 is good carving in the roof.  The     
 church was re-stored, and re-seated,  
 and the windows re-glazed in 1878-9.  
 A new stone pulpit, a chancel screen, 
 a lecturn and reading desk were also  
 installed at this time.  Over the     
 south porch is an ancient sundial.    
 The old stocks kept in the church were
 once used in the churchyard. The      
 register dates from 1643.             
   Today the church is served by a     
 vicar responsible for 3 parishes,     
 Beaford, Roborough and St. Giles.     
 Each church has one service per       
 Sunday, times being on a rota basis.  </content>
