		<title>19Day in the life of a child</title>
		<content>I get up at six twenty and go          
downstairs.I make my breakfast and     
afterwards I take the plates and cups  
out.Mum brushes my hair and I wash my  
face,and clean my teeth.I get ready and
go to school.When the bell rings I go  
into school.My teacher calls the       
register and then I do my maths.We go  
to assembly and then out to play.Back  
in school we have to do our spellings. 
At twelve o'clock we go out to play.   
After dinner  we get ready for games.  
We play football and rugby touch.When  
we come back in we do our topic.At     
twenty to three we have another        
playtime,And after a story we go home. 
I have a drink and go outside.At five  
o'clock I have my tea and watch        
television.At nine o'clock I go to bed.
At the week end I play with my         
brother and friends. Sometimes if the  
weather is fine we go to the beach .   </content>
