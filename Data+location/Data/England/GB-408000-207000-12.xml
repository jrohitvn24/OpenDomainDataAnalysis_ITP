		<title>12ABLINGTON HAULIERS</title>
		<content> The haulage business in Ablington of  
 A. Bartlett &amp; Sons has been carried on
 in the same family for 4 generations. 
 It started on a small scale in the    
 middle of the 19. Century to transport
 people by horse and trap, and to carry
 coal by horse and cart from the       
 railway station at Fosscross to the   
 large houses in the area. The business
 is now operated by two sons of the    
 family who each drives a modern       
 sophisticated lorry with lifting      
 gear. The main goods transported are  
 heavy building materials which are    
 carried within a radius of 200-300    
 miles covering the West Country, South
 coast and as far north as Kettering   
 and Northampton.
