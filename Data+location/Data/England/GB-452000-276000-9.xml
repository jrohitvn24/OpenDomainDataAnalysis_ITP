		<content>   Newton,lying on the north-east side 
 of Rugby,has a population of 312 and  
 is bordered to the north by the M6 and
 to the east by the A5.One main road   
 passes through the village.Houses     
 comprise a mixture of old,new,private 
 and council.The combined post office  
 and shop satisfies basic needs and    
 there is also a restaurant called     
 Tabuteau,plus 2 pubs-The Stag &amp;       
 Pheasant and St. Thomas's Cross.Though
 surrounded by farm land,few actually  
 work on the land but there is little  
 unemployment.20 years ago,excavations 
 from Newton to beyond A5 were carried 
 out for sand and gravel but the land  
 has now been reclaimed.A water filled 
 pit,Clifton Pool is now used for      
 fishing.A mobile library visits every 
 fortnight.There are allotments also.
