		<content>    The area we surveyed is rural.     
 Apart from isolted farms and small    
 settlements most of the housing       
 borders the Ashford Hill - Kingsclere 
 roads. We sent out questionnaires to  
 80 households which were accessible   
 from this road to try and get a       
 picture of the type of life they      
 lead.There are many large houses (41% 
 of the households have over an acre of
 land ) and there is also a Council    
 estate. 80% of the houses are owner   
 /occupied and most of the 20% rented  
 housing is probably the council       
 estate. The oldest house in the area  
 is 500 years old, 24 houses are       
 between 50-100 years old and the rest 
 have been built since world war 2.
