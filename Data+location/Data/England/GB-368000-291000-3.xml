		<content> Bridgnorth Police Force is made up of 
 Bridgnorth Town and Bridgnorth Section
 which patrols Morville, Worfield,     
 Alveley, Highley and Cleobury Mortimer
 and is under the charge of a Chief    
 Inspector and comprises thirty        
 policemen and two policewomen. The    
 worst crime that the police have dealt
 with in the Bridgnorth Area this      
 century was a murder.  The most common
 crimes committed are theft and        
 assault. The average number of        
 accidents dealt with by the Police in 
 Bridgnorth is 1.5 each day. There was 
 a considerable increase in crime in   
 1983, but in 1984 the figures have    
 dropped. 12 Police Officers from      
 Bridgnorth were involved in Picketing 
 Duties at Coal Mines during the       
 strikes in l984-85. The present Police
 Station opened in new premises in     
 1972.                                 </content>
