		<title>18Wethersfield Air Base.</title>
		<content> The air base is situated to the East  
 of Finchingfield and to the North of  
 Wethersfield.It is on high ground,but 
 the ground it is built on is flat     
 because you cant have a bumpy runway. 
 It doesnt normally have planes landing
 there,but it is always on standby.    
 It has air shows and practice flights,
 thats normally the only time when     
 aeroplanes are there.There are quite  
 a lot of things to do at the air base,
 there is Bowling,Basketball,Youth     
 club,Cinema and lots more.There is a  
 school there,the Americans go there   
 and when they finish primary school   
 they go on to Lakenheath in Suffolk.  
 Not all the people that work there    
 live there,they live all over Essex   
 and Suffolk.The R.A.F own the base,   
 the Americans lease it and Braintree  
 district council collect the rates.
