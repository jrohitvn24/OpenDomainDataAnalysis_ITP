		<title>16THE AREA IN WHICH I LIVE.</title>
		<content> The area where I live is very peaceful
 with not much traffic.There is always 
 something for you to do.Where I live  
 there are lots of different shops, a  
 cafe,garage,butcher,laundrette,bakery,
 and a first school for pupils aged 4  
 to 8.St. Andrew's Middle is a short   
 walk away.There are 2 or 3 parks      
 near,including Whinfield Rec.,where I 
 play on Sundays.Handy is the market,  
 open on Mondays,Fridays,and Saturdays.
 Our house,a modernised old terraced   
 house,not very big,is conveniently    
 placed quite near to my mum's work at 
 G.E.C.The railway is just up the road.
 Round the corner is the cattle market,
 where on occasions there is a circus  
 or fair.I go to the Methodist Church, 
 in Cambridge St.,10 mins. walk away,  
 every Sunday ,unless I have a steel   
 band practice or I'm ill.I go across  
 town to the Sports Centre when free.  </content>
