		<title>07FAUNA OF THE AREA</title>
		<content> There is a varied fauna in the        
 area.Occasional visitors to the river 
 are deer-these more especially in the 
 east of the area.Foxes are very common
 in the area and are regularly hunted  
 or shot. Mink do not seem to have     
 reached this area yet. Fish found     
 include trout (brown and rainbow) and 
 salmon. With the water being clean    
 there is a multitude of insect        
 life, some of the commonest being     
 caddis-fly larva, pond skaters and    
 stone-fly larva. There is not much    
 vegetation in the river for feeding.  
 Common birds found in the area include
 ring-ouzels, dippers an               
 oystercatchers. Relative newcomers to 
 the area include the gosander which is
 blamed for taking large numbers of    
 fish. Herons are also found on some of
 the moorland burns.
