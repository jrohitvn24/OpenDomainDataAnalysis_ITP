		<content> On a walk by the{Emmbrook}stream we   
 found many plants.There were lots of  
 stinging nettles and comfrey.A two    
 spot ladybird was sitting on hogweed. 
 Goosegrass was clinging to other      
 plants because its own stem couldn't  
 support it.(This is also called Sticky
 Billy).The ground elder was like a    
 spring green carpet.Meadow buttercups 
 were growing in little clusters.Here  
 are some of the other plants and trees
 we saw_white dead nettle,white clover,
 cow parsley, Himalayan Balsam,cut     
 leaved cranesbill,mugwort,pineapple   
 week,oak,sallow,hawthorn,crack willow,
 alder,osier and weeping willow.       
{In August 1984 the Emmbrook was       
{polluted by a leakage of chemicals    
{from a nearby factory.Thousands of    
{fish were killed.The company who      
{caused this was fined Â£2,000 and      
{helped to restock the Emm with fish. }</content>
