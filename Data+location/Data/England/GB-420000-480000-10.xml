		<title>10      SUTTON FARM</title>
		<content>   My father's farm has 230 acres.It is
 2 miles out of Masham. 160 acres is   
 arable land. It is a mixed farm.We    
 grow crops such as wheat,barley,and   
 cale,but we also keep livestock mainly
 sheep and cattle.70 acres of grass    
 land is used for silage and grazing.An
 extra 20 acres is woodland.           
   I have 4 sheep and i sold my bullock
 for Â£620 at the end of October at a   
 sale in Masham.I bought it for Â£300 a 
 year ago. I looked after it each day.I
 fed it 1.5kg of cattle feed a day.When
 it was sold it weighed 475kg.I am     
 saving money to buy another bullock.  
 The week I sold it, it won first prize
 for best bullock.                     
   At the start of the Summer I sold 4 
 lambs for Â£21 each.I eventually hope  
 to rent a field off my Dad and keep a 
 field of bullocks.
