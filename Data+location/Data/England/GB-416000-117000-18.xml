		<content>  EVERY YEAR IN JUNE OUR SCHOOL HAS A  
 FETE ON THE VILLAGE GREEN.            
  THIS YEAR IT WAS A "PINK FETE" AND IT
 WAS OPENED BY ONE OF OUR DADS DRESSED 
 AS THE PINK PANTHER. HE CAME IN A CAR 
 WITH PINK BALLOONS ON AND ALL THE     
 LADIES AND GIRLS WERE WEARING PINK    
 CLOTHES AND THE BAND WAS PLAYING.     
  THE THING I LIKED BEST WAS THE BOUNCY
 CASTLE. IT WAS INFLATED BY AN ELECTRIC
 PUMP AND THEN THE CHILDREN COULD GO   
 AND JUMP ABOUT ON IT FOR 20p.         
  AFTER I'D BEEN ON THAT I WENT TO THE 
 MAKE-UP STALL AND HAD MY HAIR SPRAYED 
 RED AND BLUE.THAT WAS 25p.            
  THEN I WENT AND BOUGHT A HOT JACKET  
 POTATO WITH CHEESE FILLING AND THAT   
 COST ME 80p.                          
  THERE WERE COMPETITIONS TOO.I ENTERED
 THE PHOTO COMPETITION AND ALSO THE ONE
 FOR THE CRAZIEST HAT BUT I DIDN'T WIN.
  THE PROFIT FROM THE FETE WAS Â£200.   </content>
