		<content> 1We spent an afternoon at Playgroup in
 the Institute,organised by a group of 
 parents.They have toys including a    
 climbing frame,prams,dolls,jigsaws,   
 cars, and many more.The children are  
 aged 3-5 years.They also use paint,   
 glue and play dough.The four year olds
 went to Mrs.Martin's reading group,an 
 important feature as there is no      
 Nursery provision in Roos.The children
 enjoyed dressing up and Richard Hoe   
 and Stacey Sedgwick did a puppet show 
 for them.Whilst the mothers tidied up 
 the children had story time,then they 
 all had a drink(orange or milk),and a 
 biscuit.After this they made gardens  
 out of crepe paper and egg boxes,and  
 some of the children made shapes with 
 the playdough.They finished with a    
 story.
