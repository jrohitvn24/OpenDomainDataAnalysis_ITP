		<content> Popular interests are gardening by men
 and women, horse-riding (young women),
 eating-out, occasional theatre visits,
 walking, golf, and watching           
 television.  Older women sew and knit,
 sometimes in aid of charities and     
 bazaars.  Younger housewives who often
 have a part or full time job, mainly  
 relax in front of the television set. 
 Teenage boys aim to buy motorbikes, in
 order to visit other villages or go to
 discoes.  Reading is aided by mobile  
 libraries which make brief stops at   
 Playford, Bealings and Rushmere       
 weekly.  News comes via newspapers    
 published in Ipswich and national     
 papers, parish church magazines,      
 advetisers free newspapers, local and 
 national radio, and television.  Two  
 Ipswich clubs share a sports field in 
 Rushmere, and Bealings has a bowling  
 green.                                </content>
