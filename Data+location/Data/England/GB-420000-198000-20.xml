		<title>20ELEGY IN A LECHLADE FIELD</title>
		<content> How long have you been lying there?   
 How did you die? Were you burnt for   
 witchcraft through a jealous          
 neighbour's lie?                      
 Were you a human sacrifice? Buried    
 with a king? Can you still hear, in   
 rotting ears, your mourning parents   
 cry? They must have been so tearful   
 when they realised you had died.      
 Do you still worship Tiw the God? Does
 he protect you still? You lie there in
 your stony bed, What thoughts run     
 through your mind? Do you think of    
 life or death, of evil work or kind?  
 How old were you when you were killed?
 Were you still a child? Did you die   
 through child-birth, or were you      
 thirty five? What do you think of     
 being handled? Poked and prodded then 
 dismantled. How do you feel about     
 being disturbed? Are you pleased or   
 just perturbed? Stephanie Pitts Age 11</content>
