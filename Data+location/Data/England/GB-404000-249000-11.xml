		<title>11FARMING</title>
		<content>   The land around Salford Priors and  
 Harvington is mainly used for farming.
 One of the biggest farms in Salford   
 Priors is Rushford farm which has 700 
 acres of land.                        
   The present farmer is Mr.B.Banting  
 who has been at the farm for 30 years.
 Mr.Banting's main crop is winter wheat
 but he also grows winter barley,      
 spring barley, oilseed rape, cattle   
 beans and grass_seeds.                
   His main problem is weeds like      
 cleavers but uses herbicides to       
 control them, but, like all farmers,  
 has other problems. One of the        
 problems is weather, but no_one can   
 control that.                         
   Mr.Banting has some livestock. He   
 has 80 beef cattle &amp; 20 horses.       
   He has a new combine harvester      
 as well as tractors, a plough,        
 cultivator etc. to help in his work.  </content>
