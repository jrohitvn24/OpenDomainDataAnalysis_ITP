		<title>09HOUSES AND HOMES.</title>
		<content>Our  houses are  normally  one  or  two
storeys high.   They are made of bricks
or stone with a  roof of  tile or slate
and very few are thatched.   Almost all
the houses in Fotheringhay are made  of
stone  with a roof  of either  slate or
thatch.                                
People usually have 2 or 3  bedrooms, a
dining room, a lounge, a  bathroom  and
a kitchen.   In  the bedrooms there are
beds,  wardrobes,  (sometimes built-in)
and a dressing table.   In the bathroom
there is a bath,  hand  basin  and w.c.
Sometimes there is a separate room  for
the w.c.   In the dining room  there is
a sideboard, a dining table and chairs.
In the kitchen there is a cooker, sink,
refrigerator, washing machine, wastebin
and cupboards.  In the lounge there are
easy chairs.   People usually watch the
television there.
