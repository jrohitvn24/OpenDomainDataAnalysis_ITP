		<content> Farmland in the area is slowly getting
 smaller and more and more acres are   
 being used for housing, but the land  
 available is used for dairy, sheep or 
 arable farming and many acres are set 
 aside for fruit and vegetable growing.
                                       
 St. Leonards Farm in Nazeing covers an
 area of 250 acres and is a sheep and  
 arable farm.                          
                                       
 Also in Nazeing is Shottentens Farm   
 which has 93 acres and is a dairy     
 farm.                                 
                                       
 Perry Hill Farm is a mixed farm with  
 74 acres.
