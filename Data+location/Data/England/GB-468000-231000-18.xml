		<title>18River Ouse &lt;1></title>
		<content>   The  river, which  meanders  through
 town from  Brakley  Road  to Stratford
 Road, is  going  to be  subject to new
 landscaping   and  {flood   prevention
 schemes. This is because  the  Anglian
 Water Authorities intend to{deepen}and
 alter the shape of the river.         
   The landscaping  operation  is to be
 carefully  watched  by  the  Aylesbury
 Vale District Council (AVDC).Old trees
 will be taken out, footbridges will be
 rebuilt and new wears made. There will
 also be a path  following  the{river's
{course} so that people  can walk along
 the river bank from  Bridge St. to the
 bridge on Stratford Fields.           
   Councillor,{Hedley Cadd}thinks  that
 all  of the  landscaping  shouldn't be
 started until all the flood prevention
 are  finished  because if it is put in
 before it may be{ruined by floods.
