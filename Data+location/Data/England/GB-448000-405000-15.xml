		<title>15Trade in Marr and Brodsworth</title>
		<content>  The village{shop}at Brodsworth is run
 by Miss Rawding known to the village  
 as Gracie.Gracie's is the village     
{"supermarket"}because she sells almost
 everything and has the best one penny 
 selection of things in our area.Gracie
 is very kind and if you are one or two
 pence short she gives you the thing   
 that you want.On Tuesdays and         
 Thursdays our school goes down to     
 Gracie's{shop}to buy some sweets.The  
{Post Office}at Marr is in a house     
 like Gracie's but apart from postal   
 things it only sells pop an crisps.   
 There is a farm{shop}at Marr which is 
 open in the summer for passing{trade. 
 There has been trouble because of     
 people selling farm produce in laybys.
 Old people who find it fairly         
 difficult to get things locally have  
 to travel to the larger towns on the  
 bus,not always easy for old people.   </content>
