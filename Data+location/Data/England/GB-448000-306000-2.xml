 Flyer'.It is published once a month   
 and contains local news and views and 
 is free.                              
   The June edition has an article     
 about the Groby Fun Run and the       
 Mini-Fun Run for under fives held the 
 previous month.Another article        
 featured fund raising for Action Aid, 
 which is used to support a village in 
 Somalia called Owr Boogeys.A local    
 teacher made a parachute jump as part 
 of the fund raising.There was also an 
 article about how difficult it is to  
 keep the churchyard tidy and free from
 weeds.There are news items about the  
 four schools in Groby and interviews  
 with the new headteachers of Brookvale
 High School and Elizabeth Woodville   
 Primary School to get their views on  
 education and to find out what hobbies
 and outside interests they have.      </content>
