		<content> There is no gas in Barkestone         
 or Plungar or Redmile.The nearest     
 place that has is Bottesford which is 
 5 miles away.We have electricity in   
 all our villages which is supplied by 
 the East Midlands Electricity Board   
 which has an office in                
 Grantham.Electricity runs under the   
 ground into our homes.These are the   
 things in my home that need           
 electricity:television telephone radio
 washing machine tumble dryer lights   
 microwave ovens toaster dishwasher    
 clock food mixer iron fan heater baby 
 alarm.Most people use petrol for cars 
 and motor bikes but lorries and some  
 cars use diesel.There is a petrol     
 storage depot at Redmile.Our school   
 uses oil to heat it and we have an oil
 tank in the playground.When we need   
 some more oil a tanker comes to school
 to deliver it.                        </content>
