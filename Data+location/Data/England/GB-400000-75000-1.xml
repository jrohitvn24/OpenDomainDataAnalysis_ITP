		<content>                                       
      This area includes part of the   
 south east coast of Dorset, within    
 the area known as the Isle of Purbeck.
 It is due south of the small resort   
 town of Swanage.                      
      Geologically, it is formed from  
 limestones of the Purbeck Series and  
 provides an undulating landscape; with
 typical downland features. There is no
 stream or watercourse within the area.
      The vegetation is consistent with
 chalkland scenery. It includes        
 grasslands, shrubs, and a multitude of
 wild plants, many of which are rare.  
      Much of the area is farmland.    
 There is also a considerable segment  
 which is a Country Park and this      
 includes part of the South West       
 Heritage coastline.
