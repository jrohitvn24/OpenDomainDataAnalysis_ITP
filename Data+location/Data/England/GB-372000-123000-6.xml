		<title>06FARMING (CLARE FARM)</title>
		<content> Mr Hodges  is a son of a farmer. On   
 Friday the 10th of May 1985 I went to 
 see him to ask him about his farm     
 (Clare Fm.) The name of his farm was  
 there when they bought it. He says the
 oldest farm he ever had was in 1914.  
 The animals he owns on his farm are   
 cattle-mainly Friesians. Mr Hodges    
 says its a family business. He took   
 over the farm after his parents in    
 1942. He started a new dairy unit     
 three years ago and set a figure limit
 reduction.He says the surplus of      
 produce is a bad thing.he said his    
 farm hasn't really changed in the last
 100 years,but it has become more      
 productive.He thinks over the next 100
 years we will probably grow more      
 cereals+potatoes and also woodlands   
 for conservation.he thinks the        
 eecgives farmers a broader outlook
