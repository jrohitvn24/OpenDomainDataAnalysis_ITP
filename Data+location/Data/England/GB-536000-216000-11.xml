		<title>11THE RIVER RIB VALLEY.</title>
		<content> The River Rib,a tributary of the River
 Lee,flows through a wide and gently   
 sloping valley. The river is usually  
 unpolluted and the water clear. There 
 are many fish,but trout,pike,dace and 
 chow were introduced recently,as there
 were not enough to allow good fishing.
 Six people put in 300 brown and       
 rainbow trout in April and July,to    
 keep the stocks up. The Thames Water  
 Authority electrocutes the coarse fish
 each year,as they eat the others.     
 There are many fords across the river.
 The largest is at Barwick,which is a  
 popular "beauty-spot". The river banks
 are very unspoilt and the wildlife is 
 abundant. Commonly found are,herons,  
 kingfishers,yellow-hammers,pheasants, 
 mallards,tits,dab-chicks,rabbits,swans
 and swallows. The Lee Valley Water    
 Company,take water from the river at  
 the Cold Christmas pumping station.   </content>
