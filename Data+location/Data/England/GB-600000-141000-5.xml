		<content>This church is found at the south end  
of Church Road in Willesborough. It is 
a Church of England church of some     
importance to the local area. Parts of 
the building stretch back over 400     
years. It is a quiet and holy place    
where people pray and sing hymns. There
are christenings, weddings and         
funerals. The tall spire is protected  
from lightning by a copper earthing    
strip. The spire contains six bells    
which are rung on special occasions.   
The Vicar, Rev. N.Brook, was pleased to
allow a school party to visit. Although
few of the children attend the Church  
regularly these days, many were        
interested to see the new organ worth  
a great deal. They noticed the Chapel  
of Remembrance for those who died in   
the Wars. Of special interest were the 
old graves of the smugglers outside.
