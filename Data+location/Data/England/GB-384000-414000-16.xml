		<title>16Norden Landscape</title>
		<content> The settlements of Norden, Caldershaw 
 and Cutgate, joined by ribbon         
 development along the A60 trunk road, 
 encroach onto the surrounding fields  
 and are flanked by modern housing     
 estates. This main road rises with    
 increasing steepness towards the N.W. 
 carrying traffic, including a bus     
 service, to Burnley, Blackburn and    
 Preston. It skirts Knowl Hill, a      
 dominant landmark visible for many    
 miles around. Open moorland and rough 
 pasture enclosed by dry stone walls   
 slope down to the valleys. Some of    
 these valleys have been drowned and   
 are now reservoirs. Wooded areas are  
 sparse but established along the      
 disused railway line. Disused quarries
 and mineshafts litter the higher      
 moorland areas, criss-crossed with    
 farm tracks and well worn footpaths.  
    Lanehead is off this main route.   </content>
