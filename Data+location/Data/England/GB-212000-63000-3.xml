		<title>03Games We Play By B.Fox</title>
		<content> One of the most popular games we play 
 is{Scrambling.}It is like follow the  
 leader,except you lead them around    
 difficult things like climbing up     
 trees, jumping over a clump of        
 nettles and swinging on branches.     
  Another game we play is{Block 1,2,3.}
 In{Block 1,2,3}someone has to count to
 61 while the others hide.Once he has  
 finished counting he looks for the    
 people who are hiding.If he finds     
 someone he runs back to the post and  
 shouts"{Block 1,2,3}see....whoever."  
 But if the other person gets there    
 first he shouts "{Block 1,2,3}all set 
 free."All the people who have been    
 caught are set free. The last one to  
 be caught is it! {                    
{                                      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
