		<title>07Local ceramics industry</title>
		<content> A number of firms in this area are    
 involved in the ceramics industry,    
 owing to the ready availability of raw
 materials. Hepworths have a major pipe
 works as do Naylor Brothers. The      
 latter was established in 1840 as a   
 civil engineering company which in    
 1877 built a stone viaduct in Denby   
 Dale replacing a wooden one. During   
 the excavations for this project, the 
 discovery of deposits of high quality 
 fire clay and shale, combined with the
 convenience of nearby coal to fire    
 the kilns (this process recently      
 changed to use liquefied natural gas),
 led to the current specialisation in  
 ceramics. Naylors employ about 450    
 and a 3/4 million pound investment    
 plan for a new kiln will create 33 new
 jobs. Naylors produce about 10% of    
 UK's industrial clay pipes, and export
 about 10% of their total production.  </content>
