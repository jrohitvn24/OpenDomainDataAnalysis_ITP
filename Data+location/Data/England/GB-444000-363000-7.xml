 within the walled courtyards are fine 
{gardens, orchards}and a{herb garden.  
 The gardens can be viewed separately  
 and attract many visitors.            
  A{Country Park}surrounds the property
 and contains a flock of{Whiteface     
{Woodland sheep}and a herd of{Longhorn 
{cattle.}The{lake}in the Park provides 
 facilities for{fishing}and{canoeing.  
 There is also a{duck decoy plantation 
 which is being renovated for future

 parts of the Park were accessible to
