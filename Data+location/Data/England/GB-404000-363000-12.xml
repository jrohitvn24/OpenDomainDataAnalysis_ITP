		<title>12Harpur-Crewe Estate</title>
		<content>     The Harpur-Crewe estate was       
founded in the early 1500s by Richard  
Harpur who was a solicitor in London.  
One of his ancestors, Henry Harpur     
married Lady Jane Crewe, and Heiress.  
     The family seat is at Calke Abbey,
Melbourne, near Derby.                 
     When the Harpur-Crewe Estate was  
at its height you could walk from one  
side of Warslow to Derby.              
     Richard Harpur-Crewe the second   
died during World War I of cancer.     
     When the tenants were renting     
Harpur-Crewe farms they were told not  
to spread lime otherwise it would kill 
the heather which would leave Sir      
Vauncy no grouse to shoot.             
     There is a hall near Warslow which
is owned by the Harpur-Crewe family.   
Miss Hermione, who is Charles          
Harpur-Crewe's sister lives there.
