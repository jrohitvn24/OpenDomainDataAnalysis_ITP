		<title>08Ecology of the Wishford area</title>
		<content> Wishford and Stapleford lie in the    
 Wylye Valley,surrounded by downs.The  
 downs are intensively farmed and      
 natural grassland has largely been    
 replaced by cereal crops.In the valley
 many water meadows still exist though 
 some have been ploughed and planted.In
 some cases the destruction of old     
 drainage channels leads to small scale
 flooding of this land in the winter.  
   The villages of Stapleford and      
 Wishford are both classified as       
 conservation areas and Ebsbury Wood is
 listed as a nature conservancy area.  
   Rights of way go from Wishford to   
 Haddon Hill and Ebsbury Hill.At       
 Stapleford there are rights of way to 
 Stapleford Down and Yarnbury Castle.  
 Another path crosses the area in N.W. 
   The R.Wylye and lakes near Steeple  
 Langford are stocked with fish and    
 ducks and swans visit these waters.   </content>
