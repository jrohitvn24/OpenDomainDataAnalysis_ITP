		<content> On Saturday, people get up between    
 6.30 and 10.30. Breakfast varies from 
 cereal and toast to sausage, bacon and
 egg. After breakfast children watch   
 "The Picture Show" on T.V. Their      
 parents tidy the house or do some     
 gardening. Some children have         
 badminton, swimming or music lessons. 
 Lunch is usually a light snack;       
 sausage rolls, sandwiches, soup or a  
 take-away. If shopping in Manchester, 
 they might eat at MacDonald's fast    
 food restaurant. Parents go shopping  
 after lunch; children either accompany
 them or play games like hide-and-seek,
 tig, roller-skating and riding bikes. 
 Tea is usually a roast meat or salad. 
 Drinks range from tea and coffee to   
 coke. Afterwards most families watch  
 T.V. while others play games or read. 
 Bedtime falls between 9.00 and 11.00  
 p.m.                                  </content>
