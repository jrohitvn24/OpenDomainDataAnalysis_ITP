		<title>04LANGUAGES IN HOUNSLOW</title>
		<content> Nearly all the children in Grove Road 
 School were born in England, and we   
{all}speak{English.}However, there are 
 over a{dozen other languages}spoken in
 our school, and this is because many  
 of our parents were born in other     
 countries. We compiled a questionnaire
 for our school, and the approximate   
 results were:{India-31%; England-29%; 
{Kenya-16%; Bangladesh-15%.}The other  
 parents came from various countries   
 in{Asia, Africa, Europe}and{South     
{America.}We have made a list of the   
 languages the children speak. We do   
 not think we have missed any, but we  
 are not sure about some of the        
 spellings:{English, Urdu, Gujerati,   
{Punjabi, Hindi, Spanish, Malayalam,   
{Kachie, Thai, Mauritian, Arabic,      
{Gaelic}and{Greek.
