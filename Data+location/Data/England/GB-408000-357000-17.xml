     Warslow Gala is always held on the
second Saturday in August and has been 
going for 13 years.                    
     The Gala starts with a procession 
through the village.  There are two    
floats, one for the present Gala Queen 
and the other for the retiring Queen.  
The Warslow Silver Band leads the      
procession.                            
     There is a fancy dress competition
which used to be just for children but 
is now open to adults too.             
     During the day there are a variety
of stalls in the village hall.  There  
used to be an old-time fair, but the   
owner died about two years ago and     
there are now more modern rides.       
     In the evening there is a dance   
at the Village Hall and the Greyhound  
pub usually run a bar.
