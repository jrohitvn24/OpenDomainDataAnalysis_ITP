		<title>08Traffic in Great Shelford</title>
		<content>  On the main road, over one hour there
 were :                                
  408 (7/min) cars going into Great    
 Shelford                              
  348 (6/min) cars going out of Great  
 Shelford                              
  (at the main intersection)           
                                       
  This was taken at about four o'clock 
 and may have been due to children     
 returning from school.                
  On a secondary road we also counted  
 the traffic over a one hour period :  
                                       
   204 (3/min) cars going into Great   
 Shelford                              
   252 (4/min) cars going out of Great 
 Shelford                              
                                       
  This was taken at about five o'clock,
 in the middle of the rush hour.
