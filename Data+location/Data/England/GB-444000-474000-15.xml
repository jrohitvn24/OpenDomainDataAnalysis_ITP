		<content> Because of its situation in lovely    
 North Yorkshire country we have two   
 caravan sites.  One, by the Horse-    
 breakers Arms in Hutton Sessay, has a 
 shop and swimming pool.  The smaller  
 site is in Sessay and takes touring   
 caravans.  Another public house, the  
 Moor and Pheasant, also caters for    
 holiday makers and local people.      
 Allied to farming there is a turkey-  
 breeding farm, a pig farm and a       
 chicken hatchery.  We also have a     
 kennels where people can leave their  
 pets for short stays.                 
 Other tradesmen include:  a dairyman, 
 a thriving repairs garage and a wood- 
 carver making oak furniture. His wife 
 ably assists with the soft furnishing.
 Another business produces and markets 
 stains and other chemicals used in    
 woodwork.  We also have a bookseller  
 and a designer of menswear.           </content>
