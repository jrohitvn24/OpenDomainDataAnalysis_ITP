		<title>16RELIGION ALL SAINTS CHURCH</title>
		<content>{ALL SAINTS CHURCH FRESHWATER}was built
 in 1180 by Norman monks. The vicar is 
 the Reverend Henley who also looks    
 after another church in Freshwater    
 called St.Agnes.Services at the church
 on Sundays are at 9.30 and 10.30 a.m. 
 Bellringers practise on the seven big 
 bells on Wednesdays from 7 to 9 p.m.  
 The churchyard of All Saints has much 
 of interest and is situated in an     
 unusually rural area overlooking the  
 river estuary now known as the River  
 Yar. The largest grave is the "ANGEL" 
 and near it is a large red marble     
 statue in memory of Max Elliot.Also   
 near the "Angel"is a headstone written
 in Dutch to the memory of Abraham     
 Bournan. Around the chuch itself are a
 number of interesting stones which    
 were probably re-positioned when the  
 church was extended in 1875,some are  
 cemented into the N and S walls.      </content>
