		<title>13Buxhall - Former Windmill</title>
		<content> Buxhall Mill ceased working as a corn 
 mill in 1968, having been in one      
 family 150 years. The present owner   
 purchased it 7 years ago, moving from 
 a nearby village. He was attracted by 
 its potential as an unusual and       
 aesthetically satisfying{family home, 
 affording privacy and spacious accomm-
 odation. He also wished to preserve   
 the windmill. In the{mill house}floors
 ceilings and many of the walls have   
 been replaced and workshops used as   
 additional living space.              
 The site includes seperate stables, 2 
 and 3 storey outbuildings. The latter 
 has been converted into 2{holiday     
{flats,}let for about 90% of the season
 March/Oct. There is still considerable
 restoration work to be carried out,   
 notably to the mill which has now been
 made weathertight to curtail further  
 deterioration.                        </content>
