		<content>    Fifty families were surveyed to    
 find out how far they travel to       
 work.Our 12km squares has three       
 villages - Garsdon, Charlton and Lea. 
 Only 30 people surveyed work within   
 the area. This is mainly because the  
 land is used for grazing cattle and   
 growing crops. So the parents who work
 in the area are mainly farmers. Most  
 of thoses asked are employed in       
 Malmesbury.                           
    Years ago most fathers worked on a 
 farm and lived on one. Results of this
 survey show this is no longer the     
 case. One father even travels to      
 Nailsworth for his job and he lives in
 Charlton. The fathers travel further  
 than the mothers. The fathers travel  
 to Chippenham, Tetbury, Cirencester,  
 Bristol, Dursley, Lynham, Calne and a 
 few other places.
