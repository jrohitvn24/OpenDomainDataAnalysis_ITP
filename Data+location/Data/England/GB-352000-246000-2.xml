		<content>      Marden and its environs have a   
 population of approximately 2000      
 people. The major part of the populace
 lives in the village itself and the   
 rest live in scattered dwellings and  
 hamlets. Once the hub of the local    
 farming community, Marden is now      
 mainly a dormitory area for commuters 
 to urban areas like Hereford,         
 Leominster and Worcester.             
                                       
      The region is still dominated by 
 the agricultral industry but the      
 increase in mechanisation has meant a 
 less labour intensive organisation and
 had a corresponding effect on the     
 village ethos. Many new residences    
 have been built in a central position 
 and while there seems to be a good    
 balance between the old and the new,  
 the village has lost much of its      
 rusticity.                            </content>
