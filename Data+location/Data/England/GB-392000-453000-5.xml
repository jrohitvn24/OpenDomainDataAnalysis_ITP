		<content>{Gargrave Primary School}is the only   
 school in the village. Opened in 1976 
 with 170 pupils, it now only uses 4 of
 the 5 classrooms, as there are only 93
 children at present.                  
 There are 4 teachers + 1 part-time, a 
 secretary, a non-teaching assistant, a
 dining supervisor, 3 Kitchen staff and
 a caretaker. All but the teachers have
 had severe cuts in their working hours
 recently.  The school is set in its   
 own playing fields between the main   
 road and the canal,  and this year won
 the Skipton Primary Schools 7-a-side  
 football competition.                 
 Children leaving this school are      
 selected for{Secondary Education}by   
 means of the 'Thorne Scheme'for either
 Skipton Girls' High School, Ermysted's
 Grammar School  or Aireville County   
 Secondary School, in Skipton.
