		<content> The residents of both villages are    
 served by General Practioners from    
 Swaffham some seven miles distant,    
 although one of these holds a surgery 
 at Narborough. The nearest chemist's  
 shop is also in Swaffham. Sometimes   
 these facts present residents with    
 difficulties concerning transport.    
 However with co-operation from friends
 and neighbours these are usually      
 overcome. The main General Hospital is
 situated in King's Lynn with a Cottage
 Hospital at Swaffham.
