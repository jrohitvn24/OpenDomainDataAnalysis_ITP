 The area surveyed by the Shrewton     
 School members is situated            
 approximately twelve miles north-west 
 of the city of Salisbury, on Salisbury
 Plain.The area includes the southern  
 part of Shrewton and a small part of  
 Winterbourne Stoke. The rural,gently  
 undulating, landscape is indicative of
 the area. The predominant land-cover  
 is farmland, the majority of which is 
 enclosed rough grazing and cultivated 
 fields.The River Till flows through   
 Shrewton giving rise to water meadows 
 near Rollestone and a scenic riverside
 walk along the Lower Backway to       
 Bourton Bridge.Other interesting      
 features include Parsonage Down which 
 is a National  Nature Reserve, and the
 Blindhouse, a temporary lock-up for   
 sheep thieves and petty criminals.
