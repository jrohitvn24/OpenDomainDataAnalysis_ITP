		<title>11Lead Lane Tree Planting.</title>
		<content>   A scheme to provide seven streets in
 Ripon's Lead Lane housing estate with 
 trees has been suggested. Maple Walk, 
 Cedar Close, Elm Road, Oak Walk, Lime 
 Walk, Beech Road and Lead Lane will   
 soon live up to their name and be     
 planted with some one hundred and     
 fifty trees between them. It is hoped 
 to plant the trees that are           
 appropriate to name of the street.    
 Harrogate Borough Council and the     
 Ripon Civic Society have agreed to    
 cover the cost of the scheme. A tree  
 planting ceremony will be arranged in 
 cooperation with the Civic Society and
 the Ripon in Bloom committee. The     
 scheme will cost Â£2,700.
