		<title>13ST.PETER'S NORMAN CHURCH</title>
		<content>{ST. Peter's Church}was mentioned in   
 the{Domesday Book.}It was rebuilt in  
 the 14th., and the 18th. centuries,   
 but fell into disuse. In 1907 it was  
 reopened and is now used regularly as 
 part of the Thornaby Group Parish. The
 first recent wedding was held in 1984.
    The church members run many groups,
 including playgroups. In the 16th.    
 century the church was given money to 
 buy five lamps,though these have now  
 disappeared. The Five Lamps, a gas    
 lamp standard, became a meeting place 
 in old Thornaby.
