		<title>08NEW BEACH HOLIDAY CENTRE</title>
		<content> Mr Hostler is the manager of the New  
 Beach Holiday Centre, which has 400   
 caravans and 89 chalets. Seventy      
 members of staff are needed in Summer 
 but only eight in Winter. As many as  
 1500 people can stay at any one time. 
 The peak season is from July to August
 when it costs between Â£100 and Â£120   
 per chalet or caravan. Entertainment  
 is provided for children such as magic
 shows, puppet shows, and Punch and    
 Judy. They also have mini-discos at   
 8pm. There are discos and bands for   
 the older people.  This Holiday Centre
 was the first self-catering camp in   
 this area. In the camp there is a     
 Bingo Hall, gift shop, shopping       
 centre, snack bar and bar. There is a 
 playground for children and a swimming
 pool with a spiral slide. In Winter a 
 farmer puts his sheep to graze on the 
 land.                                 </content>
