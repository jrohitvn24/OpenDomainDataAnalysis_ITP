		<title>09A275 LEWES TO CHAILEY ROAD</title>
		<content> The{picturesque}A275 main Lewes to    
 Chailey road passes through the       
 western edge of this block.           
 The road was improved{in the 18th     
{century as a turnpike:}Toll Cottage in
 Offham was the place to pay. In the   
 20th century more and more cars use   
 the road. It is very busy now, with   
{over 11000 vehicles daily.}Since the  
 cross_channel port was developed at   
 Newhaven and especially since the UK  
 joined the EEC the number of heavy    
 lorries has increased and the level   
 crossing at Cooksbridge causes traffic
 jams.{Many accidents have happened}to 
 pedestrians along this road as there  
 is no speed limit in or crossing in   
 Cooksbridge. A{'lollipop lady'}helps  
 children to cross but only just before
 or after school. Parents are          
{campaigning to have a pelican crossing
 installed.                            </content>
