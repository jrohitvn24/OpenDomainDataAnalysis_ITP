		<title>14Playground games in Dalton</title>
		<content>  The most popular games in our play-  
 ground are skipping and football.Some 
 of the skipping games include "Sally  
 in the Kitchen","Under Over","Cowboy  
 Joe","Spanish Lady","High,Low","Double
  Dutch",and "All in together girls."  
 The rules for "Sally in the Kitchen"  
 are one person skips and another one  
 runs in and chases them out.For "Under
 Over" first you go under the rope and 
 then over the rope etc.For "Cowboy    
 Joe"you do actions like sticking your 
 guns up and running in and out.The    
 rest are simliar to these.Some less   
 popular games at playtime include     
 hand stands against the wall,netball  
 practise,races,and tig.Netball is just
 throwing the ball to one another and  
 trying to get the ball from the other 
 team.Only a few children do running   
 races round the yard.Tig is well known
 where someone runs after other people.</content>
