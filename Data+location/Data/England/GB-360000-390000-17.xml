		<title>17EMPLOYMENT</title>
		<content> In spite of the industrial area around
 Winwick Quay and Winwick Hospital,    
 another local source  of employment,  
 many people go out of the area to     
 work.There is also a great deal of    
 unemployment in the area especially   
 among the young, and many people both 
 young and older have become           
 disheartened and do not even bother to
 look for work.The lack of job         
 prospects for school leavers does not 
 seem to have affected children's      
 attitudes to their work, and many     
 children are going back to school     
 after the age of 16 to continue their 
 studies because they have no jobs to  
 go to.Crime in the area is on the     
 increase _petty theft and             
 shoplifting.Schools suffer break_ins  
 from time to time and also vandalism _
 broken windows, fences pulled down    
 etc.                                  </content>
