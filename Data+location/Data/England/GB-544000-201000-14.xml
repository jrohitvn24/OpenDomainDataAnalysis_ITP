		<title>14NEW MOTORWAYS NEAR EPPING</title>
		<content> Many people living near the M25       
 between{Theydon Garnon}and{Waltham    
{Abbey}are angry about the concrete    
 surface and the noise it makes.The    
 motorway is particularly noisy between
 5a.m.and 10a.m.when the wind is       
 blowing south_ west.As a result of a  
 public outcry in 1974,the{Bell Common 
{tunnel}was built underneath Epping    
 Forest.It cost between{25}and{35      
 million pounds.On top of the tunnel is
 a cricket pitch which was spoilt in   
 the process of constructing the       
 tunnel.It has been rebuilt with a     
 magnificent pavilion, but it will not 
 be ready until the summer of          
 1986.Motorways are very useful for    
 communication. As Mr and Mrs Holland  
 of Ladderstile Farm said,"We like the 
 motorway because you can travel       
{quickly and easily}to your destination
 but the M25 doesn't please everyone." </content>
