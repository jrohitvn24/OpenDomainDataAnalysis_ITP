		<title>17FRAN BOX-A day in the life 2</title>
		<content> The childrens' bedtime is around 7pm. 
 Martin,leaves Bedales at 6.30,8.30 or 
 10.30pm depending on his duties for   
 the day.(Bedales is an independent,   
 residential, coeducational secondary  
 school in Steep).Evenings at home are 
 spent doing chores,reading, watching  
 TV,and for Martin, doing work for his 
 Open University Degree.When possible  
 Martin and Fran try to find time to   
 continue doing improvements to their  
 house.The two cottages knocked into   
 one provide excellent accomodation.5  
 bedrooms,3 living rooms,1 kitchen,1   
 bathroom, and a shower/cloakroom. At  
 the front of the cottages is a fine   
 old well with a working pump, and at  
 the rear two Edwardian washhouses each
 with a stone sink and fireplace. Fran 
 and Martin are very pleased with the  
 improvements so far, but admit that   
 they are never ending. Finally to bed!</content>
