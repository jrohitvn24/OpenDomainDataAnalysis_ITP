{   Moor Ridding}is located to the     
 South of Bridgnorth. The building has 
 been there since 1211.                
   {King Henry viii}used to fish and   
 hunt there.On the{23rd October}every  
 year at the Law courts of London,they 
 still carry on the medievil custom of 
{handing over the faggots of wood}from 
 Moor Riddings to the Corporation of   
 the{City of London.                   
    The faggots of wood are first      
 chopped with a blunt 'bill hook',which
 won't chop them through. Then a       
 hatchet is taken, which cuts them     
 through with its first blow.The       
 Ceremony is conducted by the Queen's  
 Remembrance.
