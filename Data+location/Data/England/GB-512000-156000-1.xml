		<content>    Fetcham is a popular residential   
 area.This may be because Fetcham is   
 surrounded by mainly countryside and  
 is peaceful.Many of the houses are    
 quite old and some are of historic    
 interest.A large area of the          
 countryside is the wooded area of     
 Bookham Common.Around it there is     
 rough grazing used by the farms.      
    In our block we have the River Mole
 and M-25.These both run across our    
 block.At three points the R.Mole goes 
 under the M-25.The river runs nearby  
 most of the farms and is also good for
 leisure purposes.The M-25 is still    
 under construction and should be      
 finished soon.                        
    In our block we have many buildings
 other than residential houses. Interes
 _ting buildings include:Woodlands     
 Park, Slyfield House, an old church   
 and The Yehudi Menuhin School of Music</content>
