		<content> Our area is situated 3km.north of     
 Bolton town centre.The north of our   
 area is high moorland only suitable   
 for sheep grazing.On lower land there 
 is a small amount of dairy farming.   
 Further south the area becomes        
 residential and some industry takes   
 place.The houses vary from old        
 terraced to semi-detached and         
 detached.                             
 There are three major roads.These are 
 Blackburn Road which divides to form  
 Belmont Road,Halliwell Road which     
 becomes Smithills Dean Road and Moss  
 Bank Way which is a ring road round   
 Bolton.                               
 In our area there are three streams,  
 Astley Brook joins Raveden Brook and  
 later on at Astley Bridge these are   
 joined by Eagley Brook to form the    
 River Tonge.
