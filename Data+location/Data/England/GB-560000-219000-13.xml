		<title>13A Day Spent with Relations</title>
		<content>   The bell of my alarm clock went off.
 My dog jumped on me. I looked at the  
 clock. It said 8 o'clock. I went to   
 have a wash. I put on my pink and     
 white suit. I could smell bacon and   
 eggs, but it was for my brother. I had
 Shreddies.                            
   We drove through the Dartford       
 Tunnel; it cost 60p and there was a   
 traffic jam.  When I got to my        
 cousin's, I had a Sunday lunch which  
 was roast potatoes, beef and cabbage. 
 My cousin and I walked to the swimming
 pool. It had a blue tube to slide down
 and water jumps. It was very good. For
 supper we had chicken and chips which 
 were very tasty. I went with my cousin
 to see a film called Alien. I had some
 pop corn. Then I went home.           
   Before I went to bed I brushed my   
 teeth. I was very tired. It was 10    
 0'clock and I went straight to sleep. </content>
