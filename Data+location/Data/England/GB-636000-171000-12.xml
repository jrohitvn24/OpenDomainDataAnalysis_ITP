		<title>12    Playground Games</title>
		<content>    During the last week of the summer 
 term, we made a survey of playground  
 games. The most popular games are     
 catching and chasing others, next ball
 games, then skipping, then            
 'imagination' games 'goodies and      
 baddies' of different kinds. Some     
 games are for a few children, others  
 for a large number. Many games have   
 one child 'on', who catches others,   
 who then either chase with him, or    
 her, or have to be released by the    
 rest - Had, Stuck in the mud. In some 
 ball games (Wall Ball, Space Invaders,
 Had Ball) the person on has to hit the
 others with a ball while they run,    
 sometimes within a named area. The    
 first person hit is the next on. Some 
 combine chasing with 'hide and        
 seek'-Ting-Tang-Tommy. Football,      
 Cricket and rounders are also popular
