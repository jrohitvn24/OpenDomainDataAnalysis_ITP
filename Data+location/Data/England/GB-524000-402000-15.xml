		<content>   Many objects in the house are       
 electrical.We have televisions,       
 washing machines,irons and fires.     
 Before electricity was installed in   
 1922 life was hard. Candles had to be 
 lit so people could see in the dark,  
 coal was an expensive fuel, washing   
 had to be done by hand and irons had  
 to be heated by the fire so they could
 be used.                              
   Today we can sit at home in the     
 evening and watch television or use a 
 video machine to see a film. We can   
 keep foods in the refrigerator in hot 
 weather and store food for many months
 in the freezer.Our hair can be dried  
 in a few minutes, with the use of a   
 hair-dryer and clothes can be dried in
 a tumble-dryer.We can clean the house 
 with a vacuum-cleaner and our teeth   
 with an electric toothbrush.Now,we    
 are lucky enough to have electricity. </content>
