		<content>When Joe Parman of Stafford Rd.Gretton 
goes to bed he is read a story by one  
of his parents and often reads other   
books himself.He is always asleep by 8 
o'clock.Friday evening is the exception
as he often goes swimming with his     
family in Rothwell and has a late tea  
with his aunt and her family in        
Desborough.In summertime Joe goes out  
to play with his friends before and    
after tea,very often on his bicycle,   
near the house or on the edge of the   
recreation field close by.In wintertime
he plays indoors with jigsaws,games,toy
cars etc.sometimes drawing,colouring or
watching T.V.too.He likes cartoons,the 
"A"Team and"Crackerjack".              
His favourite game in the summer is    
French cricket,where a player stands   
defending his legs with a bat,while his
opponents forming a circle round him   
bowl underarm at him with a soft ball. </content>
