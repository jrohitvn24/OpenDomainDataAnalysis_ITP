		<content>      We found from our Amenity Count  
 that there was only one food shop in  
 our area - the small Post Office and  
 Stores at Trenear.  This made us      
 wonder how people managed to get most 
 of their shopping, so we sent out a   
 questionnaire to our parents.         
      The results showed us that most  
 people did their shopping in Helston, 
 our nearest town, although some did   
 use other towns about 10 miles away,  
 because these had larger stores and   
 Cash and Carry markets.  They had to  
 travel there by car and so did a lot  
 of shopping at once so that it was    
 more worth while going.  Some people  
 shared transport with friends.        
      Several people said that if a    
 grocery shop opened locally they might
 use it - if its prices were           
 competitive.                          
                                       </content>
