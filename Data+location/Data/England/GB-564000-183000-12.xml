		<title>12Horndon parish Church</title>
		<content> The Parish Church of St. Peter and St.
 Paul is situated on land between      
 Orsett Road and Mill Lane.  The       
 present Vicar is Rev. D. William, who 
 is also the Rural Dean.  It has many  
 beautiful features including a wooden 
 belfry built in the 15th Century and a
 stained glass window.  A fund has been
 set up to collect money for the repair
 of this window.  It has a typical     
 Essex steeple, which dominates the    
 skyline of Horndon from many angles.  
 A lychgate in Orsett Road provides the
 main entrance.  The Church has been   
 vandalised and, unfortunately, is     
 locked except for services or unless  
 somebody in authority is present.  At 
 the time of the Feast and Fayre the   
 Church has a beautiful Flower Festival
 and musical concernt.
