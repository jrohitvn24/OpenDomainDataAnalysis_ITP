		<title>10My Club-Swimming</title>
		<content> In the summer Sports Roundabout       
 at Lacon Childe includes an outdoor   
 swimming club. It is on Tuesdays and  
 Thursdays. I usually go on Tuesdays.  
 It is forty pence to get in. You can  
 either go from six till seven or seven
 till eight. There are usually a lot   
 of children there and I go from six   
 until seven. I go swimming with the   
 school as well. It's my favourite     
 sport. I'm not exactly brilliant      
 but I enjoy it very much.             
 At swimming I practise diving and     
 swimming lengths. I do cartwheels off 
 the diving board into the water. I can
 pick the brick up from the deep end   
 but sometimes I don't manage to pick  
 it up. I look forward to the summer   
 which is the only time we can use our 
 open-air pool. The pool was provided  
 by public subscription about twenty   
 years ago.                            </content>
