		<title>02SHOPPING IN SOUTHPORT</title>
		<content>   Southport is a very well known      
 shopping area in the North-West.The   
 main shops are on Lord Street which   
 runs right through the centre of the  
 town.                                 
   Many people come to Southport by    
 the train.The station is on Chapel    
 Street,and the trains run to it from  
 many places including Bootle,Liverpool
 Ormskirk and Preston.For the driver,  
 there is ample parking space and      
 Southport also has its free park and  
 ride shoppers bus service on Saturdays
 which eases the parking problem.      
   Lord Street is one of the most      
 famous shopping streets in the country
 One side is arcaded and is primarily  
 victorian,where as the other side is  
 made up of dignified buildings and    
 gardens.This makes a lovely contrast  
 and so shopping in Southport is very  
 enjoyable.                            </content>
