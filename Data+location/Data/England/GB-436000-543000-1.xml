		<title>01** S.HETTON AND HASWELL **</title>
		<content>{**************************************
 The villages of S.Hetton and Haswell  
 lie centrally in the N and S of the   
 survey block which consists of        
 residential,farming and industrial    
 land in roughly equal proportions.    
       The smaller village Haswell is  
 the older dating back to the year 1338
 whereas the larger S.Hetton only      
 developed in the early 19th Century   
 when the colliery was opened.         
       Both villages are declining in  
 terms of population, Haswell because  
 of isolation from main routes and     
 S.Hetton because of the closure of the
 colliery in 1982/83.                  
       The villages form two discrete  
 units separated from one another and  
 from surrounding urban areas by mixed 
 agricultural land composed mainly of  
 small farms.
