		<title>19FUTURE OF CORNBURY ESTATE</title>
		<content>{Taxation }can {cripple }large estates 
 like {Cornbury.}Repairs and           
 maintenance are costly. Although the {
{house} is in good repair and easily   
 run - heated by a boiler burning wood 
 from the estate - the {1670 Chapel }  
 needs expensive {restoration }soon.   
 The {gardens} are not elaborate - a { 
{pleasure ground }of shrubs and mown   
 lawns with peacocks. The 4acre vege-  
 table garden and greenhouses serve the
 house alone. Routine {maintenance }   
 includes mending the Park walls and   
 roads and fencing with homegrown      
 timber. For the Estate to survive, {  
{management }must become more {        
{commercial.} Forestry and shooting are
 beginning to pay their way and farming
 is now more cost-effective. 4{lakes } 
 in the Park are not exploited. There  
 is {no policy to open the house to the
{public.}                              </content>
