		<content> There are fifty members of the        
 Catforth Womens Institute, with an    
 average of thirty two members         
 attending the monthly meetings held in
 the village hall, on the first        
 Wednesday of the month at 7.30 p.m.   
 The meeting opens with the singing of 
 Jerusalem. The minutes of the last    
 meeting are  read, business,          
 correspondence and matters arising are
 discussed. The talk or demonstration  
 by a guest 'speaker' lasts forty five 
 minutes , the subject can vary        
 from cookery to renovating furniture. 
 The monthly competition is then       
 judged by the 'speaker' the winner and
 two others gain points for the Sally  
 Lawson trophy awarded annually. A     
 raffle is held for W.I. funds. Supper 
 is then served, and the meeting closes
 at 10 p.m. with the singing of the    
 National Anthem.                      </content>
