		<title>20A  day in the life of.......</title>
		<content> On Mondays I hate getting up for      
 school.I get up at 8.00am but often I 
 get woken at 06.30 by the alarm to    
 wake my brother for his paper round.  
 Colette calls about 8.30am. We go to  
 Mrs.Tiffin the lollipop lady,and wait 
 for Lois coming off the school coach. 
 Usually we go to the P.O.for sweets &amp; 
 then we go down to school. The bell   
 goes at 9.00am.Mrs Newton does the    
 registers &amp; then it is assembly.On a  
 Monday we do Complete English and     
 Geography, then S.M.P maths ,&amp; P.E.   
 Finally we write down our weeKly      
 spellings and if we have time we      
 listen to some story. At playtime Lois
 &amp; I sell the crisps to the infants.The
 bell for lunch goes at 12.00.We are on
 second sitting so we play out first   
 then I have my sandwiches.At home I   
 watch T.V,play out, or read a book. I 
 go to bed at 9.30p.m.Monday is over!  </content>
