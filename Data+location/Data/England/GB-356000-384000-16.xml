		<title>16MANCHESTER SHIP CANAL.</title>
		<content> The Moore Lane Swingbridge is one of a
 number of swingbridges on the{M.S.C.} 
 This one is particularly important as 
 it provides the only access to two big
 warehouse complexes owned by{Dupont}  
 and{American Can(UK).}The bridge is   
 manned 7 days a week,24 hours a day.  
 There are eight men employed on the   
 bridge,working in pairs.They work in 8
 hour shifts 6am-2pm,2pm-10pm and      
 10pm-6am.As economy measure the       
 company hope to introduce 1 man only  
 shifts.Even then there is a danger of 
 this section of the canal closing.    
 Average of 10 ships a day.Main use is 
 for{"Sludge Ships"}carrying the       
 effluent of Manchester, Warrington,   
 Runcorn and Bolton to be dumped at sea
 over Mersey Bar.Pipeline to be built  
 so ships redundant as from 1987.The   
 two men interviewed,Jim Berry &amp; Jeff  
 Millington each had 30 years service. </content>
