		<content> We found 2 farms on the ordnance      
 survey map. We visited Rowley Green   
 Farm and found that it hadn't been a  
 farm for some time. The man who lived 
 there said he had 7 acres of rough    
 grazing where he kept 4 goats and 2   
 horses. He was hoping to have a       
 poultry farm and planned to keep 1,000
 chickens.                             
 We also went to Strangeways Farm which
 has 250 acres. Grass is cultivated on 
 most of the ground which feeds 100    
 horses and 16 bullocks. Silage is made
 to feed them in the winter. Fire      
 destroyed all the farm buildings in   
 1975 when there was a dairy herd of   
 100 cows. The buildings have since    
 been renewed.
