		<title>03History of the Camp Area</title>
		<content> On the outskirts of{St. Albans}is a   
 district called{the Camp,}because a   
 volunteer camp had been held there in 
 the late 19th Century.{St. Peter's    
{Rural School Board}was set up in{1878 
 and from then on several schools were 
 built including{Camp School,}which is 
 the only one still in use as a school.
 Originally these were elementary      
 schools which catered for all ages.   
 The area was being built up just      
 before the{1914-1918 war.}The printing
 press for the{Salvation Army}was      
 started then as{Campfield Press;}it is
 still there. There was also a clothing
 factory,{Aquascutum.}In{Sutton Road   
 near to Camp School, there was a      
{railway bridge}which carried the      
 branch line to Hatfield. It was always
 flooded beneath the bridge when it    
 rained. I saw an old photograph of    
 this. The bridge no longer exists.    </content>
