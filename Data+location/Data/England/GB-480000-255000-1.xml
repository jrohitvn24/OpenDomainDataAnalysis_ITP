This area in S.E.Northamptonshire,very 
close to the Buckinghamshire border is 
rural in character.In the segment being
described there are two villages Denton
in the N.E. corner lies on the         
A.428(T)road and Hackleton in the      
S.W.on the B.526.                      
The whole area is covered by very      
heavy clay with here and there small   
outcrops of grit.The latter supports   
the small woodlands and copses while   
the former is used by farmers for crop 
growing,especially cereals and rape    
oil seed.                              
The area is fairly flat and low        
lying(approximately 350 feet above     
sea-level)                             
Two unclassified roads traverse from   
North to South, thus making            
communication between the two villages 
relatively easy.                       </content>
