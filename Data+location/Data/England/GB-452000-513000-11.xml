		<title>11RD TRANSPORT MARTON/N'THORPE</title>
		<content> Nunthorpe and Marton are well served  
 by roads. The main north/south A172   
 passes through and drivers can suffer 
 long delays and traffic queues at peak
 commuter times. Marton can be badly   
 affected. There is a plan to possibly 
 build a new relief road from Swan's   
 Corner to Gypsy Lane, and then        
 alongside the railway line into       
 Middlesbrough. The main local traffic 
 arteries are Gypsy Lane and           
 Guisborough Rd. The A171 leads        
 directly from Swans's Corner to       
 Guisborough. The A1043 was specially  
 built to take traffic around          
 Nunthorpe. A survey of the Marton area
 found that 97% of families who        
 responded owned cars, 93% travelled by
 car often, 5% not very often, and 2%  
 never. The area has a regular bus     
 service linking the area to           
 Guisborough, Stokesley &amp; Middlesbrough</content>
