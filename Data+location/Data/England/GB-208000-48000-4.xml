  At the Gribbin,the only housing was a
 farm at Menabilly Barton and a house  
 (which used to be an old boat house)  
 above Polridmouth Beach.              
  The farmhouse was old.It was cream   
 painted.Most of the farmbuildings were
 made of stone, the newer ones of      
 wood.There was a Silage Barn where    
 they stored the cooked grass.         
  The house at Polridmouth had a big   
 lake beside it which swans were       
 swimming on.Beside it was a big lawn. 
 The house was a grey granite building.

  There were lots of trees near the    
 house and a path by some fields with  
 cattle in them.Beyond the fields you  
 could mostly see green pasture,cliffs 
 and sea.                              </content>
