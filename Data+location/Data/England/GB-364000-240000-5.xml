		<title>05ASHPERTON PARK: OLD WOODLAND</title>
		<content> Ashperton Park is situated in the     
 south of the Parish of Ashperton,     
 covering almost 48\ acres of mainly   
 deciduous woodland, traversed by many 
 pathways. It is bordered in the east  
 by the main A417 road and in the      
 North, South and East by farmland.    
 Notable flora and fauna include deer, 
 said to have been introduced within   
 the last ten years, fox, badger, grey 
 squirrel, great spotted woodpecker,   
 pygmy shrew, and common spotted       
 orchid. The trees are mainly hardwood 
 of Oak, some Beech, Birch and         
 Chestnut. The west end  near Woodend  
 has been replanted in recent years    
 with coniferous trees. The latest     
 felled area has been replanted with   
 oak saplings. Until this year the     
 shooting rights have been on an annual
 basis. The wood was stocked with      
 pheasant and pathways kept clear.     </content>
