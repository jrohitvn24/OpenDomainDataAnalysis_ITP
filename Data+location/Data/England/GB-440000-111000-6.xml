 I was late for school this morning    
 because I went to sleep at 11:30 last 
 night. At 8:10 this morning my little 
 brother woke me up and by the time I  
 got dressed it was 8:20. I had a      
 quarter of an hour to find my         
 trainers. I took twenty minutes to    
 have my breakfast and it took me five 
 minutes to make my bed. By the time   
 I changed my shirt it was 8:59 and one
 of my legs was asleep so I could not  
 run to school. When I found a coat peg
 the time was 9:10. I have a varoucca  
 on my foot so it was hard to walk to  
 school. On the way to school there was
 a road digger in Foundry Lane so I had
 to take the long route to school.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
