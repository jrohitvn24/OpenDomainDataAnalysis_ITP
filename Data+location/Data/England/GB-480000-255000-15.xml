		<title>15 AN 8 YEAR OLD'S DAY.</title>
		<content>My Mum wakes me in the morning at about
quarter past 7 before she goes to work.
Before I go to school I play with the  
computer or I sometimes play games with
my sister.                             
I have my breakfast of toast and then I
clean my teeth.On my way to school I   
call for my friend Amy and we walk up  
together.                              
Just before we go into class at        
9o'clock we have a sort of playtime.Amy
and I like to play horses.When we go   
into class we usually do English or    
Maths.                                 
At half past 10 we have playtime. Amy  
and I again play horses or snakes and  
dragons.When we come in from play at   
quarter to 11 we carry on with our     
English or our Maths.Yesterday I did   
some of my own research about the      
N.American Plains Indians and I found  
out quite a bit.(cont'd on page 16).   </content>
