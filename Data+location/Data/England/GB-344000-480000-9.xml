		<content>{Access}There is adequate, albeit      
 narrow, road access via the B5282 from
 the A6 to the eastern shoreline of the
 estuary. Access to the western side is
 via the A590(T) Barrow road. The      
 nearest rail link is 2 miles distant  
 at Arnside.                           
{Accommodation}Whilst the area attracts
 mainly day visitors, accommodation is 
 available at the two inns and various 
 bed &amp; breakfast establishments on both
 sides of the estuary. More extensive  
 accommodation is to be found nearby at
 Arnside and Grange over Sands.        
{Amenities}The estuary shoreline       
 provides tourist attractions. Equable 
 weather, superb views across the water
 to the Lake District mountains and    
 spectacular sunsets together with a   
 varied and rich ecology provide the   
 main attractions. Angling, bird       
 watching and rambling are popular.    </content>
