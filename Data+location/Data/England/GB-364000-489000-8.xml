		<content>      {Catholes}is a small group of    
 buildings dating back to the 15/16th  
 century situated about a mile         
 south-east of Sedbergh alongside the  
 river Dee.  One of the farm buildings 
 has been converted into 'bunkhouse'   
 type accommodation for visiting groups
 - schools etc.  Unusual markings on   
 the original beams, taken from the old
 sailing ships coming into Maryport,   
 indicate the age and 'authenticity' of
 the buildings.                        
       The area is dominated by        
 deciduous woodland in which there is a
 small lime kiln.                      
       A small mound near to Abbott    
 Holme Bridge (a Roman bridge)         
 indicates the position of an old Roman
 fort and the vegetation mirrors the   
 boundary of the fort.
