 West Kennet to the West, Wedhampton to
 the South and Tidworth (the present   
 day spelling of Tedworth) to the South
 East. Foxes are sought in this area,  
 but are only persued over these       
 boundaries if necessary.              
 The hounds meet three days per week   
 between 1st September - 31st October  
 for Cub Hunting and twice a week for  
 Fox Hunting during the season         
 commencing lst November.
