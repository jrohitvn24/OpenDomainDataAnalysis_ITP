 wanted to mine under Kinoulton,they   
 were very concerned because of the    
 possible subsidence and damage to the 
 houses,and so they formed a committee 
{CRACK- Committee of Residents Against 
{Coal-mining}under{Kinoulton.}It was   
 told that there was going to be a     
{PUBLIC INQUIRY}because the Coal       
 Board needed permission from the      
 County Council.                       
      At the inquiry Nottinghamshire   
 County Council said that they would   
 give permission on two conditions-{   
{1.}There had to be minimal subsidence 
 damage to houses.                     
{2.}No mining under what was the site  
 of the old brickworks as it was a     
{SITE of SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST.
