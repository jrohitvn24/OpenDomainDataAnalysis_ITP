		<title>02KILBURN(DERBY)AREA HOUSING</title>
		<content> Kilburn village has seen a lot of     
 new housing in the last 25 years, and 
 there are few houses which were built 
 in the last century. The majority of  
 the village's houses are home_owned   
 and are of brick and tiles rather than
 stone and slate. Most of the housing  
 in Denby village is relatively new,   
 but the housing of Denby Bottles is   
 chiefly a 1930s council development,  
 also of brick. There are some older   
 houses in the Rawson Green and        
 Cinderhill area, but a similar age to 
 that of Denby Bottles. Openwoodgate   
 has some larger houses, but little    
 modern development and a number of    
 stone houses, typical of Belper.      
 Holbrook also has a sizeable          
 proportion of stone houses. Horsley   
 Woodhouse's housing is chiefly 1930's 
 Council housing.
