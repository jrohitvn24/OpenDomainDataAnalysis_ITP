 has mostly sheep.Box Tree Farm is a   
 Trout Farm.The Trout Farm keeps a lot 
 of Rainbow Trout and sells most of    
 them to the general public.           
    As well as selling trout,they also 
 sell eggs.At the moment they have     
 about two hundred trout,which they get
 from another trout farm.The most      
 expensive trout is the Salmon Trout,as
 it is a very large trout.             
 The Trout Farm is situated in a       
 very good position as it is easily    
 accessible being close to the         
 Stratford Road.
