		<content> When we went to{Penn}the first thing  
 we noticed was that we were on a      
 hillside looking over the valley. It  
 was a lovely view. We saw trees       
 climbing the other hillside.{Penn}is  
 in{Buckinghamshire}600ft above sea    
 level with an area of 4,182 acres.    
{Penn}is in the middle of a triangle   
 really because there is{High Wycombe  
 in the West,{Amersham}to the North    
 East and{Beaconsfield} to the South   
 East. Most houses in{Penn}are over 100
 years old and some are 300 years old. 
 Houses cost between Â£100,000 and      
 Â£300,000. We noticed a Methodist      
 chapel built in 1808 and Holy Trinity 
 church built in 1077. The Crown Inn is
 over 3oo year old,.It is made of brick
 and has a clay roof. We can tell it   
 is very old because its chimney is out
 side. It has a vast amount of ivy on  
 it.                                   </content>
