		<content>A DAY IN MY LIFE-NIKKI OSBORNE-27.5.85 
We woke up at 7.30.Then we had         
breakfast and got washed and dressed.  
Then I watched a little television.Then
I went outside to play on my slide and 
I made a camp out of my climbing frame.
I had a very quick lunch.After that dad
and I put up the swings then it rained 
a little so we went in and got ready to
go to our friends for tea in Barrow.   
Their names are Robert,Andrew,Chris and
Elizabeth.After eating tea with them we
played outside in their garden.        
Elizabeth (who is 17) looked after us  
while mum and dad and Mr. and Mrs.     
Scott went out to see their new house  
in Dalham.When mum and dad got back    
they had a meal with Mr. and Mrs. Scott
while we played in the playroom.Then we
had to go home, it was very late, after
10.00 p.m.I was glad to see my bed.I   
even think I forgot to say my prayers. </content>
