		<content>         An Interview.                 
       We interviewed our school cook, 
 Mrs Rowcliffe and assistant cook, Mrs 
 Enticott. They said that Ashbrittle   
 has changed a lot over the years.     
       They said that an old witch used
 to live in Mrs Enticott's house. Mrs  
 Enticott keeps hearing strange noises.
 There was also a man who had great    
 power in the village. If he couldn't  
 get rid of someone he didn't like, he 
 had been known to even have their     
 house pulled down.                    
       Four very popular games were    
 hoops, hop scotch, marbles and        
 skipping. You could get Horlicks for  
 half a penny and a quarter of a pound 
 of sweets for three old pence.        
       There was a bus for going to the
 cinema, on Wednesdays and Saturdays.  
                                       
                                       </content>
