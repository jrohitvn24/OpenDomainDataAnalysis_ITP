		<title>18Transport around Hordley</title>
		<content>  This rural area, like  so many others
 is poorly served by  public transport.
  On Mondays to Fridays a bus runs from
 Oswestry to Shrewsbury via Hordley. It
 is convenient only for  school  pupils
 as it arrives at 0840  and  leaves  at
 1620. The only other services  are  to
 Ellesmere  market  on Tuesdays, and on
 Wednesdays  to  Oswestry  market. Just
 north  of  Lower  Frankton, a bus runs
 regularly   on   the   main  road. The
 nearest  railway station is  8km. away
 at Gobowen where trains run to Chester
 and  Shrewsbury. The  canal  used   to
 transport both  goods  and  passengers
 but is  now  mainly a water feeder and
 tourist amenity.Transport is a problem
 unless you  own a private car, and, to
 overcome this,a scheme has been set up
 whereby a rota of local  drivers takes
 people on routine visits to hospitals,
 doctors or chemists.                  </content>
