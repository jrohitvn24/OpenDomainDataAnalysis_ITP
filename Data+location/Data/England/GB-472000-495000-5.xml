		<content> There is no regular{Public Transport  
 other than a privately run Minibus    
 that leaves the village at 10.00am for
 Pickering, where it is Market Day, and
 returns to the Village about 2.00pm.  
 The school children who live more than
 2 miles away are brought to the school
 by taxi.(i.e.Landrover)               
 Practically all families have a car as
 it is essential for shopping and      
 travelling to work. Young teenagers   
 learn to drive as soon as possible,   
 firstly a motor cycle at 16 and a car 
 at 17.Some of the young men take a    
 driving test on a tractor.            
 Horse Riding is very popular amongst  
 the young girls in the Dale which is  
 not only a leisure activity but also a
 mode of transport.
