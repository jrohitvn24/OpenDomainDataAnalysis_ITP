		<title>02Cowtons in the 20th Century</title>
		<content> 'Cowtons' is a collective word to     
 cover 3 parishes in this area.        
 The largest is the expanding East     
 Cowton, with a population of 600.     
 North Cowton has a population of      
 350, and lastly South Cowton which    
 covers the hamlet of Atley Hill       
 and the Pepper Arden estate.          
 The countryside is mainly flat,       
 with a few gentle hills. It is        
 mostly farm land, there being 12      
 major farms in the area.              
 Apart from sport the main villages    
 are fairly independant of each other  
 and rarely meet for joint activities. 
 The District boundary divides the     
 area. E Cowton is in the Hambleton    
 District and N &amp; S Cowtons in the     
 Richmondshire District. Thus the      
 secondary school children attend      
 schools in their respective districts 
 and rarely come into contact.         </content>
