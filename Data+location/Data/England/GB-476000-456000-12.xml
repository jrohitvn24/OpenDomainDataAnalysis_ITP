		<title>12PHEASANT REARING AT GARROWBY</title>
		<content>      Over 5,500 pheasants are reared  
 in three big huts.  There are 20 cages
 in one big hut so in three big huts   
 altogether there are 60 cages for the 
 pheasants.  When they are three weeks 
 old they go into a run fixed on to the
 hut outside so they can run about and 
 try flying.  There is a Head          
 Gamekeeper and two Under Keepers.  In 
 the shooting season 3 to 4 thousand   
 pheasants are shot.  There are usually
 about 10 guns on shooting days and    
 there are 30 sometimes 40 beaters.    
 They usually take about 4 dogs to help
 pick up the game.
