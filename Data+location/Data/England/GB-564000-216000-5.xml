		<content>{Felsted Place Farm}belongs to Mr.     
 Crawford. He has been there for 55    
 years.                                
    There are 15,000 acres of land and 
 each acre would cost about Â£1,500 to  
 buy.He employs two men.               
    The main crops this year are rape  
 and wheat.The rape is grown for oil   
 and in late Spring many of the fields 
 are bright yellow with rape flowers.  
 Wheat is grown for the grain which is 
 sent away to be made into flour.      
 Mr. Crawford has two tractors which   
 are quite old.He has three barns.     
 There were four, but one burnt down in
 1984 and he lost a lot of straw in the
 fire.
