		<title>12THE LYME REGIS TOWN BAND</title>
		<content> The colours of the town's band are a  
 red jacket, white shirt, black        
 trousers,shoes and tie.The conductor  
 is called Joe O'Donnell.              
 The band has its practice on Tuesdays 
 and Thursdays and in the summer they  
 play on the front. They have got a    
 variety of instruments ranging from a 
 Cornet to a set of Drums. They are    
 better than most bands and they play  
 interesting music. At Christmas they  
 have a concert and play carols all    
 over Lyme Regis collecting for new    
 instruments and equipment. The quality
 of the band's playing is very good.   
 One of the best cornet players is     
 called Simon Brooks, a student at     
 Woodroffe School.
