		<content>   At one time{sheep fairs}were held on
 St.John's Common. Farmers came from   
 outlying districts to sell their      
 animals.                              
   For a long time the main industries 
 of Burgess Hill were{pottery}and{     
{brickmaking.}Many streets and public  
 houses still bear the names which show
 the one-time importance of these      
 activities.                           
   There were only two schools in 1898.
 At this time the laundry was an old   
 farmhouse, we now have two            
 launderettes. There were two          
 blacksmiths in the town. A firm of    
 wheelwrights, E.Hole and Son, founded 
 at that time, still carries out modern
 work and renovations.                 
   There is in the town a{Local{History
{Society}which studies the history of  
 the area, has helped to produce books 
 and helps preserve photos and records.</content>
