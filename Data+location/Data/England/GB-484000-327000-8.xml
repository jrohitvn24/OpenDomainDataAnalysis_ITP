		<title>08PROPOSED SALTBY COALMINE.</title>
		<content> The southern boundary of the Vale of  
 Belvoir coalfield passes approximately
 west-east through the centre of the   
 area. On 23 August 1978 the National  
 Coal Board, after three years of      
 exploration, submitted their Planning 
 Applications to local Borough         
 Councils. Three pits were proposed, at
 Asfordby, Hose and near Saltby. The   
 proposals were fought by the local    
 residents at a Public Enquiry on      
 environmental grounds and the question
 of the need for the coal. Asfordby    
 mine was given planning permission,   
 Hose was refused. The N.C.B. were told
 to re-apply for the Saltby pit at the 
 west end of King Lud's Entrenchments. 
 If developed it would have an output  
 of 2 million tonnes saleable coal per 
 year and shafts about 750 metres deep.
 The mine site would cover 30 hectares,
 the tip (south of this area) 246 ha.  </content>
