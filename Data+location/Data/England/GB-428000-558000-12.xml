		<content> The Freightliner Terminal is one      
 of 24 freightliner terminals and 10   
 container ports in the British Isles. 
 They{transport}to almost all the      
 countries in Europe. Their cases range
 from 20,30 to 40ft and they have      
 trucks to haul these cases.  They do  
 not own many of their own trucks but  
 use mainly the contractors' transport.
 They are largely subsidised by{British
{Rail.}They work an average of 47 hours
 a week.                               
    Follingsby House Sewage Works takes
 house waste, processes it and releases
 it into the{River Don.}In the third   
 stage the waste water is put into a   
 tank with minute worms in which they  
 destroy the bacteria.  The water is   
 cleansed further still and is then    
 released into the River Don.  This    
 plant will shortly be closed.
