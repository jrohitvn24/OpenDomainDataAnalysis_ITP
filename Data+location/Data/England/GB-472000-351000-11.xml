		<title>11Provision of health care.</title>
		<content>  The general standard of health of the
 community is relatively high.         
 The nearest{health centre}is at       
 Southwell and this is well equipped   
 and offers a comprehensive service.   
{Dentists}are also at Southwell.       
 For the minority of people without    
 their own transport, the standard of  
 health care is very much reduced as   
 doctors are unlikely to make home     
 visits except in cases of emergency.  
{District Nurses}and{Health Visitors   
 visit those in need of special care.  
{Hospitals}are at Newark, Nottingham   
 and Mansfield. Waiting lists are long 
 for all non-emergency operations and  
 many people belong to{private health  
 care schemes in order to receive more 
 prompt hospital treatment.            
 Welfare of the elderly in the villages
 tends to be the responsibility of     
 relatives and neighbours.             </content>
