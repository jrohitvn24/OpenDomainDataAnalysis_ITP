		<content> The A3076 (Class 1) road is the main  
 road into the area traversing North   
 through the middle of 9, 5 and 1 to   
 meet the A30 (Trunk road) at Carland  
 Cross (1), at which junction an       
 improvement has taken place to        
 facilitate increased traffic flow.    
 Other minor roads criss-cross the area
 in 2,3,4,7,8,9,10 and 12, either      
 linking with A3076 or connecting      
 farmsteads.  The old Ford on the South
 boundary of 12 has been built over.   
 Cornwall 'Busways run daily services  
 along the A3076 from Truro to Newquay 
 and return.  A local 'Bus Operator,   
 Harris of Summercourt, runs services  
 along the A3076 from St Colmb to Truro
 and return on Wednesdays and Saturdays
 of each week.
