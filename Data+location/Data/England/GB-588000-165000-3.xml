		<content> Sited within the survey block are five
 schools. Iwade and Bobbing are both   
 state primary schools for children of 
 5 to 11 years. Middletune junior takes
 children of 7 to 11 years from the    
 Milton area. Also in the Milton area  
 are St Thomas' and St Bartholemews for
 children with learning difficulties   
 the former is for educationally sub   
 normal (ESN) and the latter for those 
 with severe physical handicaps, both  
 schools take children from a wide     
 area. Bobbing is small with only 30   
 children and although thought to close
 it has just had new toilets and       
 scullery provided. Iwade is larger    
 with 120 pupils and a mixture of old  
 and new buildings with some toilets   
 still outside. Middletune has modern  
 purpose built facilities. After 11    
 most pupils transfer to Sittingbourne 
 schools, usually Westlands.           </content>
