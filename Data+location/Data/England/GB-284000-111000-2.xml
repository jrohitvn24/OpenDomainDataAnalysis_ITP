		<content>                                       
 Cruwys Morchard offers a landscape of 
 small hedged and banked meadows of    
 irregular shape, interspersed with    
 patches of broadleaved woodland, on   
 gently undulating hills and small     
 steep valleys eroded by the action of 
 streams. Rainfall is high and the     
 grass stays green through most of the 
 year.                                 
 Most farms are isolated, set in       
 sheltered positions on the slopes of  
 hills where water is available. The   
 pattern of the fields and covers      
 indicates ancient clearances from the 
 natural woodland. One hamlet,         
 Pennymoor, is set on a ridge at 239m  
 while Church and Manor House are more 
 sheltered at 220m. The settlements and
 farms are connected by a network of   
 narrow highbanked lanes, with only one
 main road, the A373, added in the 19c.</content>
