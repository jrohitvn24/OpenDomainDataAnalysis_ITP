		<content>  The farms in this b1ock are mainly   
 sheep farms. In November ewes are     
 gathered for{tupping.}In December/    
 January farmers{fother}them with hay  
 to help them survive the winter. In   
 February they are fed sheep cake to   
 help them provide more milk for lambs.
 In April the farmer gathers the ewes  
 for lambing because the moor is       
 exposed and the farmer can check to   
 see if they are well. When the lambs  
 are born they are tagged and marked to
 show to which farmer each lamb belongs
  In June/July the ewes are{tailed,}the
{hogs and ewes}are clipped, the tup    
 lambs are castrated and all the sheep 
 are dipped.  The lambs are removed    
 from their mothers who go back to the 
 moor until tupping.  Farmers keep the 
{gimmer (female)}lambs for breeding but
 sell the{wether (male)}lambs at market
 in the Autumn.                        </content>
