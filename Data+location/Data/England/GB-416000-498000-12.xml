		<title>12Colburn Village.</title>
		<content> Going north down{Colburn Lane}is a    
 council housing estate.Only a small   
 number have bought their houses from  
{Richmondshire}District Council.Below  
 this estate are eight individually    
 designed stone bungalows.Colburn      
 village has twenty two houses ,three  
 being farms,and a{population}of forty 
 five.Running through the village is a 
 beck .The owner of the sixteenth      
 century hall also owns the village    
 pub.The houses facing the beck are    
 very old cottages that have been      
 modernised .More recent houses blend  
 in with the old.Running by the hall is
 a public footpath which leads to the  
{River Swale}by the side of{Christie  }
{Wood}.The village is a settled        
 community and houses for sale are     
 rare.It is usually people from outside
 Colburn who buy and come to live in   
 the village. (E.Carter)               </content>
