		<title>01COLD ASHTON PARISH, AVON.</title>
		<content>     Our area is a very rural area     
 though only about 8 miles from the    
 centre of{Bristol,}to the west , and 5
 miles from{Bath,}to the South. Part of
 it forms the southern end of the      
 Cotswolds and, from Tog Hill, there   
 are panoramic views across Bristol to 
 Wales and the Severn Estuary.         
     Except for the village of{Cold    
{Ashton}(and this is small) there is no
 development of any sort, except for   
 the odd farm house, old cottages and 2
 pubs.                                 
     There are 2 busy main{roads       
 passing through  the area from Bristol
 to London and Bath to  the M4 and     
 Cheltenham. The few people living in  
 the area are very supportive of each  
 other as they have to travel for any  
 amenity they require.  {
