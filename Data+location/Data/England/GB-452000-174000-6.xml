   Nearly half the children at {       
{Yattendon School}live in Frilsham.    
   There used to be a school there     
 until 1951 but then it was closed and 
 a bus was provided to take the        
 children to Yattendon. Then the bus   
 was taken away, so nowadays most      
 children come by car and the Mums take
 it in turns to drive.                 
   There aren't any shops in Frilsham  
 and only three in Yattendon, four if  
 you count the hairdresser's. They are 
 the Post Office, The Butcher and the  
 old Post Office which just sells      
 sweets. Most families go shopping in  
 Sava Centre in Theale because it's    
 easier to park there than in Newbury. 
   Hampstead Norris only has one shop, 
 the Post Office and general store.
