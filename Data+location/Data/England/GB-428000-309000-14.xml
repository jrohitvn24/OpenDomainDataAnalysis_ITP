		<content>  Two other houses of historic interest
 are{The Moat House}and{The Old Rectory
  The Moat House is all that is left of
 the original{Manor House}built in the 
 14th century near the church.The stone
 part was the gate house which led into
 a courtyard around which the house was
 built. The whole was surrounded by a  
{moat}with a draw-bridge entrance.There
 is evidence of battlements above the  
 front door. The{timber framed wattle  
{and daub}section was added in 1560.   
  The{Old Rectory}was built in The     
 1800s and stands on the western       
 outskirts of the village.The{Moore    
 family not only owned the Hall but at 
 one time provided a rector as well.The
 present eldest member of the Moore    
 Family,{Aubrey,}is well into his 90's 
 but can remember living at the rectory
 and attending Appleby Grammar School  
 (The Sir John Moore School) in 1902!  </content>
