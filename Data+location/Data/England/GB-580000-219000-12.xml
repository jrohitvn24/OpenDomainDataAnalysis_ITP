		<content> The landscape is flat to gently       
 rolling and is mainly used for arable 
 farming.There are small areas of semi_
 natural woodland.Hedgerows lost much  
 of their timber due to Dutch elm      
 disease and have not yet recovered    
 There are considerable reserves of    
 gravel which are causing changes,     
 exhausted workings being converted to 
 farm reservoirs.Recently permission to
 convert has been refused.Few water    
 courses cross the area_streams        
 originating as farm drainage systems. 
 Apart from modern village development 
 there are well spaced farmhouses and  
 buildings most of timber construction 
 dating from 14th to 18th century.
