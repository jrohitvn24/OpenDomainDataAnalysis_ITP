   My name is Tracey Blockwell I have  
 lived in Swaffham all my life. l have 
 a grandad living in Swaffham. My      
 grandad used to be in the Swaffham    
 town football team in the 1930's with 
 his brother. My grandad's brother     
 later went into the war, he didn't    
 have to but he thought it would be a  
 change.                               
 In the  war he caught a disease called
 Disantry. He died when he was twenty  
 nine years old and his name is on the 
 war memorial and in the parish church.
 My dad's name is exactly the same as  
 my grandad's brother because my       
 grandad was named him after him.
