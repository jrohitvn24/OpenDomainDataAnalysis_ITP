 The area includes the west half of the
 town of Ripley and extends west to the
 village of Heage,and south to the     
 hamlets of Street Lane,Marehay and the
 outskirts of Belper.The underlying    
 Coal Measures give a landscape of low 
 ridges draining S.W.to the River      
 Derwent in Belper.The Coal Measures   
 have also shaped the human landscape  
 with the growth of mining settlements 
 in the 19th Century,old workings of   
 iron and coal and in the past 40 years
 opencast mining.Today industry is     
 limited to small light units.Although 
 now predominately a farming area,the  
 Coal Measures have a further effect   
 giving low grade farm land resulting  
 from the underlying clays and the     
 effects of opencast coal mining.
