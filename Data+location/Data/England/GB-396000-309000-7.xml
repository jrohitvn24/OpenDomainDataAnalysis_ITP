  Life for children in Cannock is      
varied and exciting. Here are some     
extracts from some days in the lives of
some junior school children from       
Chadsmoor school.                      
 FRIDAY 20th June 1985

  "My mum woke me up with a cup of     
coffee. Then I went downstairs and had 
my breakfast of fried eggs,bacon,      
sausage and fried bread. After watching
"Breakfast Television" I went to get   
dressed."                              
 SATURDAY 21st June 1985

   When i realised it was Saturday I   
snuggled back into bed and I looked at 
my Liverpool Football Team poster on   
the wall. I picked up my "Eagle and    
Tiger" comic and settled down for a    
good read.                             </content>
