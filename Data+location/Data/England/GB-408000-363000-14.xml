		<title>14Buses in Longnor</title>
		<content>     Buses are a type of public and    
private transport.  They are a very    
good type of transport if you haven't  
got your own means of transport.   They
link Buxton, Longnor, Sheen, Warslow   
and Leek.  Clewes take trips to        
Altringham ice rink.                   
     Clewes, Suttons, Blackhursts,     
Coopers and Wints take children to     
school, either to Warslow or Leek.     
Warslow schoolchildren go swimming on  
Tuesdays and Wints' bus takes them.    
If they go on a visit somewhere, it is 
usually Coopers who take them.         
     The school buses run on weekdays  
and the Buxton bus runs every day      
except Sundays, weekdays at 8a.m. and  
3p.m., Saturdays every 2 hours.  It    
costs 60 pence to do the whole journey 
Warslow to Buxton.  The Leek bus goes  
every Wednesday.
