		<content>{       }The village and surrounding   
 district is served by a mobile library
 van which comes every Thursday from 11
 a.m. to 4 p.m. The library has been   
 criticised because of the time of day 
 it comes _ not a great deal of help to
 school children or working adults. It 
 was also felt that the choice of books
 was limited and did not cater for some
 groups e.g. teenagers, and that the   
 stock of books was not changed often  
 enough.                               
         The library staff, however, do
 make a great effort to obtain books on
 special request.                      
         Some people obviously felt the
 need for a permanent Library, but the 
 County Council at the moment feel that
 the size of the population did not    
 warrant one.
