		<content> About 1.5 miles east of{Blackmore     
 there is an area of{woodland}.It is   
 made up of four woods,Parsons Spring, 
 Birch Spring,Barrow Wood and College  
 wood.The woods are seperated by{banks 
 and{ditches},which are several hundred
 years old.They were originally built  
 to keep deer from wandering out of the
 woods and had wooden fences on top of 
 the bank.{Coppicing}has been carried  
 out from 1982 to 1985.The coppiced    
 wood is sent to Bowater to be used for
 making paper.The{ecology}is varied.   
 There are Oak,Sweet Chestnut, Hornbeam
 and Silver Birch.There are 2 species  
 of deer.Three herds of Fallow deer and
 one herd of Monk Back deer,squirrels, 
 badgers,foxes,rabbits, kingfishers and
 nightingales.The woods are ideal for  
{recreation}such as horseriding and    
 rambling.
