		<title>11St. Katherine's Knockholt</title>
		<content> St Katherine's Church is over seven   
 hundred years old. It was built on the
 site of a ruined Norman church by a   
 certain Ralph Scott in the parish of  
 Ocolte, as Knockholt was then called, 
 "because of the many Perils of Souls" 
 that befell parishoners when they     
 travelled to their parish church at   
 Orpington, and was consecrated in May 
 1281. The yew tree in the churchyard  
 is about as old as the church. The    
 parish registers date from 1548,only  
 ten years after Cromwell introduced   
 such registers. The fine organ has    
 recently been completely renovated.   
 The church today is substanially as it
 was when bulit seven hundred years    
 ago, with the addition of the tower   
 and North Aisle. Apart from the usual 
 Anglican services, the Roman Catholic 
 community use the building for their  
 service on Sunday afternoon.          </content>
