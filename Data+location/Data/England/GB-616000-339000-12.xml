		<title>12MEMORIES OF AYLMERTON</title>
		<content>  One villager interviewed was born in 
 the village on 21 March, 1901, and has
 lived in the village all his life.    
 His wife is 83 years old, and they    
 have been married for 63 years.  He   
 was a{farmworker}most of his working  
 life, with 37 years on one farm.      
  When he started work, at the age of  
 13, he worked from 6a.m. on Monday to 
 6.30p.m. on Saturday.  There were{no  
{holidays}- except for Christmas Day   
 and half a day on Good Friday (but    
 only if he went to church on Good     
 Friday afternoon).  On finishing work 
 at 6.30p.m. on a Saturday, he would   
 dress up and walk or cycle to the     
 pictures in Cromer (no bus service).  
  He remembers about 40 men being      
 employed on farms in the parish, some 
 of whom came from outside the village.
  Now, there are less than 12, as farms
 have become more mechanised.          </content>
