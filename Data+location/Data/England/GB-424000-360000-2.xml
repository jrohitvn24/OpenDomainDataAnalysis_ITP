		<title>02Lead mining</title>
		<content> Long ago in South Darley there was    
 a lot of{lead mining.}The result was a
 lot of derelict,abandoned mine shafts.
 The mine roofs were held up with      
 timber props which are now rotting.The
 County Council put up warnings about  
 the danger in this area,as many are   
 collapsing.The entrances have been    
 capped off with concrete.Pollution is 
 something that has happened as a      
 result of this lead mining.The water  
 is polluted and there are many old    
 spoil heaps.Enthovens is a factory    
 that used to mine lead but it only    
 recycles and smelts lead now.It has a 
 big chimney that gives off harmful    
 smoke which pollutes the air.There are
 quite a lot of tests carried out to   
 make sure the pollution levels do not 
 become to high.Exhaust smoke from cars
 also polutes the air with lead,but    
 there isn't much traffic in the area. </content>
