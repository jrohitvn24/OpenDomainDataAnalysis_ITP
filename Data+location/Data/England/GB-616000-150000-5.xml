		<title>05BISHOPSBOURNE SHOP &amp; P.O.</title>
		<content> The combined shop and P.O. exists     
 precariously due to the proximity of  
 Canterbury. The owner states, "Our    
 role is to cater for the small popul- 
 ation and we have to be more than a   
 stop-gap between visits to the super- 
 markets. As well as the usual provis- 
 ions and P.O. services, we sell news- 
 papers and bread to order, also calor 
 gas and paraffin which are widely used
 as half the village has no mains gas. 
 The elderly rely heavily on us, whilst
 the younger people pop in for items   
 forgotten in town. We store the       
 village wheelchair, take messages and 
 return books to the mobile library for
 people in their absence. The public   
 phone box outside is well used. Often 
 I have raided my own larder to satisfy
 a customer. I know people still appr- 
 eciate a friendly personal service,   
 rarely encountered in town stores".   </content>
