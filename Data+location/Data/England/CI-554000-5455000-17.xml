		<title>17Opinions of St.Ouen's folk.</title>
		<content>  We asked an English person why do you
 live in St.Ouen she replied "because  
 St.Ouen is the most picturesque       
 parish with rolling hills and         
 beautiful countryside." We then asked 
 for a comparison between England and  
 St.Ouen , she replied "The pace of    
 life is far slower then most places in
 England and far more relaxed.The      
 people are very friendly.I also think 
 the standard of living is better."    
  We then asked 86 year old Mr.J. Le   
 Gresley who has lived in St.Ouen all  
 his life, if St. Ouens has changed    
 very much in his lifetime. He thinks  
 there is now a lot more houses than   
 there used to be. He also thinks St.  
 Ouen has become much busier,the roads 
 have improved a great deal but there  
 are also  many more cars than there   
 used to be. He also thinks there are  
 many more English people living here. </content>
