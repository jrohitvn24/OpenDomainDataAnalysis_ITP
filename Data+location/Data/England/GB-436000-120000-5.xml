		<title>05Shirley Funnell French trip</title>
		<content> On Thursday 28 March 1985,I got up    
 at  7.00am.I was really excited       
 because I was going to France for the 
 day.I woke mum and dad,washed (very   
 well) and got dressed.At 7.35am we set
 off for Portsmouth.When we arrived at 
 Townsend Thoreson harbour there was a 
 queue so dad dropped me and mum off   
 just outside.After a lot of walking we
 got to the ship.It was called The     
 Viking Venturer.On board the ship we  
 went up to the Observer Room to choose
 a seat.When the ship had moved off I  
 went and explored it.There were lots  
 of things to see. I bought a pen.     
 After the third hour Iwent on to the  
 deck. It was very windy. Then suddenly
 we spotted France. When we got nearer 
 I took some pictures. We arrived (at  
 about 1.15pm) and went to look around 
 the shops. I had a nice chocolate ice-
 cream.I was sad when we went home.    </content>
