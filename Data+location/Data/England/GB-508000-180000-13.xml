		<title>13INFANT SCHOOL -FINDING OUT 1</title>
		<content>  We discovered that most              
 children come to school on foot, so it
 would seem that they do not live very 
 far. Most children come to school with
 their friends though many come by     
 themselves. Most also come with an    
 adult relation. Most children in our  
 school leave for school between 8.30  
 am and 9.00 am.                       
                                       
                                       
  We did a survey about the people who 
 came to our class and found out that  
 most people live in houses; most      
 people still have their milk delivered
 by the milkman and most of our mums do
 not work in the daytime.              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
