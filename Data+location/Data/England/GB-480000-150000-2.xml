		<content>          Our group visited the British
 Headquarters of the Gurkhas in Sandy  
 Lane. The barracks are wooden huts.   
 These housed the R.A.M.C. during World
 War II.The men sleep in dorimtories   
 for 12 and each man has a wardrobe    
 and locker.They shared an ironing     
 table and an electic kettle and a duty
 board. Meals are communal and there is
 a Hindu priest on the site.While      
 stationed in Crookham Gurkhas do      
 plenty of fitness training as well as 
 their other duties. The Gurkha        
 band has a practice nearly every      
 morning .                             
   Gurkhas are good at hill running    
 and prefer it to flat ground.They are 
 very good infantry men,and often win  
 trophies at the annual Bisley Rifle   
 competitions.The Gurkha pipe band     
 plays at local carnivals and fetes,and
 many  fairs have Gurkha curry stalls. </content>
