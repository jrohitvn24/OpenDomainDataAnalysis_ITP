		<content> The people in XXXXXXX Road will always
 help each other. The AAAs, for        
 example, have a large extension in    
 front of their house which is         
 undecorated. They let us store our    
 furniture there while our house was   
 treated for subsidence. If I ever come
 home and find no-one in I can go down 
 to the BBBs to watch television       
 until my parents come home. Harry BBB 
 used to go to school with my Dad and  
 comes to our house quite often to play
 cards. The lady across the road is    
 about 60 and comes out about 7.30 in  
 the morning to sweep leaves from her  
 drive. We call her "nosey Rosie" as   
 she is always peeping round the       
 curtains, seeing what is going on. A  
 few years back the man who lived in   
 the end house lost his wife and some  
 months later he was found hung in his 
 bathroom.                             </content>
