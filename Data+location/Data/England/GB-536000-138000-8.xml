		<content> East Grinstead was a Market town built
 using traditional methods and         
 materials.Many old buildings are being
 replaced by new which do not always   
 fit in.Concern was shown about the    
 siting of new buildings,for example,  
 the new block to the north of         
 St.Swithen's Church.Many believed     
 that current planning ideas could lead
 to East Grinstead becoming like other 
 modern industrial towns.              
 Concern was also shown about litter   
 giving a bad impression of the town to
 visitors,particulaly in the locality  
 of the cinema,railway station and     
 arcade by Sainsbury's.                
 Many approved of the use made of the  
 old railway line,now Worth Way Nature 
 Reserve, but there was a feeling that 
 much more could be done to educate the
 public about conservation.
