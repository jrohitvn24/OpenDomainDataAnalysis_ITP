		<title>05 Gosforth Park Golf Centre.</title>
		<content>   On June 5th we visited Gosforth Park
Golf Centre near the racecourse.First  
we met Andrew Meir the manager.The     
centre has an 18hole golf course,a     
bar, a cafe,driving range &amp; a pitch and
putt.Next we talked to the employees.  
Peter Allison,the green keeper said    
the best thing about his job was       
being outside when the hot weather     
came.He has met K.Keegan and Bucks     
Fizz.There are men's, women's and      
junior weekly tournaments.             
Then we talked to the two ladies in    
the cafe.Margaret Elliot has enjoyed   
working there for five years.The       
summer season is the busiest time      
when guests from Gosforth Park Hotel   
visit the centre. We talked to people  
playing golf. Most were members  who   
played two to four times a week.They   
thought the facilities were good for   
novices but not for better players.    </content>
