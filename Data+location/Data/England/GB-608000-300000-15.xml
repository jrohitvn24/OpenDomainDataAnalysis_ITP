		<title>15EVERYDAY LIFE 2 (Town)</title>
		<content>   We live around the back of the town 
 centre. After school we sometimes go  
 into the town to play with our        
 friends. Then we might go over to the 
 shop and buy some  sweets. Over there 
 everybody has a B.M.X bike. Sometimes 
 the town gets so hot and on Fridays   
 and Saturdays it gets so crowded,     
 that we go for bike rides into the    
 countryside. We like the country      
 because there is hardly any noise.In  
 the town there is lots of pollution   
 because of the lorries.               
   We live on the outskirts.There are  
 absolutely no facilities where we live
 no shops or anything and the roads are
 pretty poor. At weekends we tend to go
 elsewhere. Otherwise we just play in  
 each others gardens or roller skate   
 around the pavements. Sometimes we go 
 into the fields and climb trees, or go
 birdwatching.       {(Mixed Group A)  </content>
