		<content> Milk is collected from nearby farms by
 milk tankers, the average milk intake 
 is per day is 100,000 gallons. Milk is
 pumped from the milk tankers into     
 30,000 gallon milk storage silos. From
 the silos it is pasteurised which     
 kills the germs.  It is separated into
 cream and skim milk.                  
 The cream is then homogenised which   
 breaks up the fat globules into either
 48% or 18% cream. The cream is then   
 packed into cartons.                  
 The skimmed milk can be either dried  
 or mixed with sugar &amp; fruit to make   
 yogurt.  Cottage cheese is also made  
 at the factory along with soft cheese.
 There are many laboratories testing   
 the incoming milk also the products   
 are tested for bacteria.  The waste   
 water goes to an effluent plant which 
 treats it before it is returned to the
 river.     Sarah Nowell.              </content>
