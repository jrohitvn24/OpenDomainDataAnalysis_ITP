{William Elmehyrste}and{William        
{Broddesworth}were allowed to build a  
 Grammar school on a piece of waste    
 ground near to the church.Boarders    
 were taken and they slept in the      
 village nearby.Much later it became a 
 Primary School and eventually closed  
 in 1962.The building is now used      
 partly as a private house and partly  
 as a Church Hall were a{Thrift Shop}is
 held,second hand clothes are sold to  
 boost church funds.Worsbrough Village 
 was then without a school of its own  
 until new housing forced the building 
 of a new school{Worsbrough St Marys   
{Church of England School}in 1973.It is
 a small school having just three      
 classes and 58 children on role at
