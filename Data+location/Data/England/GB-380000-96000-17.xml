		<content> Milborne st Andrew Church.            
 The church was built in 1067.  It is  
 built of knapped flint and stone.  The
 church is on the south western side of
 the village and has two fine Norman   
 arches.  One is the south porch       
 doorway to the nave, which has a      
 zig-zag ornament of brown and white   
 voussoirs.  The other arch is found   
 over the Moreton Chapel on the east   
 wing.  Restorations were carried out  
 in 1878 and an early Norman font was  
 found in the churchyard, during 1930. 
 The font has since been placed in the 
 centre of the western aisle.  The font
 is carved from one piece of stone, and
 its shape is of an imitation water    
 butt, staked with pegs at the base and
 held with cable at the top.  The      
 earliest traceable name of the vicars 
 is 1327 and he was called Thomas De   
 Bucklesworth. There has been 49 since.</content>
