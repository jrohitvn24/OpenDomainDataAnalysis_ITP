 and produced coal by 1876, this was   
 the beginning of Station Town. It     
 joined onto the southern border of    
 Wingate;there is no separation.The    
 Station was at the edge of Wingate    
 hence Station Town.It is a residential
 area, the west side of the main road  
 having council houses, an old peoples'
 home,a garage and Millbank Chapel     
 _the only Methodist church left in the
 area.On the east side of the road are 
 private terraced houses.Behind these  
 is a new deuelopment of council houses
 (replacing old terraced houses),an old
 person's complex and a community      
 centre. There is also a Co_op and     
 several small shops.Where Wingate and
