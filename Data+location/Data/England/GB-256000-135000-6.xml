		<content> Shirwell, although only a small       
 community, is able to boast that it   
 has a playgroup.  This, in common with
 many other activities in the district,
 is held at the Village Hall.  It is   
 organised by ladies who live in       
 Shirwell but draws its children from  
 as far afield as Loxhore and other    
 villages out towards the parish       
 boundary with Bratton Fleming.        
 The playgroup is held on Tuesdays and 
 Thursdays from 10.00 to 12.00 a.m.    
 with a break for milk and biscuits    
 half way through.                     
   Some, although not all of the pupils
 transfer to Shirwell School for the   
 term in which they become 5 years of  
 age.  The school is doing its best to 
 encourage more children to move from  
 the playgroup to the local Primary    
 when they are of age but faces an     
 uphill battle against larger schools. </content>
