		<title>04The  London  Docklands</title>
		<content>                                       
   The Docklands, which for many years 
were the nerve centre of Englands      
imports and exports, fell into gradual 
disuse after the Second World War. Some
years ago the government created the   
London Docklands Development           
Corporation to revitalise the area. It 
is now a scene of great change.        
   Many of the wharves, such as Gun    
Wharf and King Henry V's,are being     
converted into luxury appartments.Many 
of the warehouses are also being       
renovated. Some will become homes,some 
will become drama, art, music and dance
studios, while others are fast becoming
bases for thriving businesses. Even an 
airport is being planned.              
   These developments have apparently  
caused a conflict of interest between  
the poor local community and the       
comparatively wealthy newcomers.       </content>
