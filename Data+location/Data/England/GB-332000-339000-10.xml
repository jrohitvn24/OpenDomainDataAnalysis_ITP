		<title>10Plas Thomas farm, Ellesmere</title>
		<content> Plas Thomas is a very large dairy     
 farm. It is one hundred and fifty one 
 acres and eighteen of it is woodland. 
 Milk is produced on this farm and it  
 is sold to the Milk Marketing Board,  
 who collect it. A family own the farm 
 and the workers are a father and two  
 sons. All the cattle are Ayrshires,   
 one hundred are cows, fifty are       
 replacement rearing and sixty are beef
 cattle. Most of the land is used for  
 grazing the cattle and for silage. The
 farm make their own silage.           
  The farm was built in the 15th       
 century. The machines they use are    
 tractors, mowers, ploughs, silagers   
 and a forage box. The wildlife found  
 on the farm are foxes, badgers and    
 grey squirrels. The farmhouse looks   
 much older than the other farm        
 buildings, which are barns, storage   
 garages and cow stalls.               </content>
