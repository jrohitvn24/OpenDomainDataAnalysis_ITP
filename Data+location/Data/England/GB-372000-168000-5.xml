		<content> Our School is a country school.  It   
 has only 86 children.  Only 2 of the  
 children come from families in the    
 village.  All the rest come from some 
 distance away and travel to school    
 either by car or mini bus.            
 There are three classrooms, the       
 original one is made out of stone with
 a tiled roof, the other two are mobile
 classrooms made from wood.            
 The age range is 4 to ll.  I am in    
 class 3 which is the top class and    
 will be leaving very soon to go to    
 Secondary school in Bath.             
 In School we have a Headmistress, two 
 full time teachers, two part time     
 teachers, all female.                 
 All but two children stay at school   
 for dinner, some bring a packed       
 lunch.Hot meals are cooked in a       
 central kitchen and sent to school    
 they cost 64p.                        </content>
