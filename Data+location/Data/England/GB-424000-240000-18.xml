		<content>  Shipston was on a{stage-coach}route  
 and three one-time coaching inns are  
 recognisable today.                   
  A horse-drawn{tramway}operated       
 between Stratford-upon-Avon and       
 Moreton-in-Marsh.A branch line from   
 this ran to Shipston. This was later  
 converted to a{railway}line.Passenger 
 services ran until 1929.The nearest   
 railway station today is at Moreton-  
 in-Marsh.
