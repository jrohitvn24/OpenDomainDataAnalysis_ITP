		<title>13The Old Brickyard-Kinoulton</title>
		<content>     During the{Public Inquiry}in May, 
 1985 into Coal-Mining under Kinoulton,
 many people learned for the first time
 about a{"Site of Special Scientific   
{Interest"}in Kinoulton. Most villagers
 knew of the{Old Brickyard}near the    
 canal to the S.E.of the bridge, but   
 did not realise its importance.       
    The area was made a S.S.S.I. in    
 1983 because it included some of the  
 richest marsh and open water habitats 
 in Nottinghamshire. The site has three
 parts-grassland, grazed marsh and open
 water and there are suitable feeding  
 and breeding conditions for a wide    
 range of birds.                       
    Many unusual plants and flowers    
 have grown there undisturbed for many 
 years.   There is concern that if     
 mining took place under that area,    
 land drainage would change and alter  
 the conditions.                       </content>
