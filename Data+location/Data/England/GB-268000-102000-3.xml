		<content>When the area was more heavily         
populated, it could support a wide     
range of trades and services. Now the  
village is fortunate to have a         
shop-cum-Post Office which manages to  
meet most of the shopping needs of its 
customers. This is run by a husband and
wife who get up at 5.00 am to deliver  
milk to the village and surrounding    
homes.                                 
There is also a range of mobile shops  
which call on a weekly basis, including
a fresh fish van, greengrocers and     
mobile fish and chip van.              
Other visiting services are: mobile    
library; newspaper deliveries; window  
cleaners and two mail deliveries and   
collections on weekdays.
