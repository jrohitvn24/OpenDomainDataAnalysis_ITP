		<content> Many houses are close to open         
 countryside. One parent has a         
 freshwater stream running through his 
 garden. Most houses are near to the   
 two major parks; Cheetham's and       
 Stamford. The Library, ?Art Gallery,  
 and town shopping facilities are      
 within walking distance. Good bus     
 services mean people can travel easily
 from their homes. The railway station 
 is within walking distance of most    
 homes.                                
 Some people think there should be more
 facilities for childrens' play,       
 especially for ball games in the      
 housing areas. Some avenues and grass 
 verges are in a generally intidy and  
 dirty condition. Not everybody shows  
 pride in their surroundings by keeping
 their gardens and paths tidy. There is
 sometimes a lot of litter lying about.
