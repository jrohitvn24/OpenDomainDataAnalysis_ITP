 Meadow,Sugar Loaves,Christmas Fields  
 and Oxford Meadow. They are small     
{estates}compared with those in        
 Braintree . Houses on the{estates}are 
 mostly modern style. The four main    
 types are detached,semi-detached,     
 terraced and bungalows.               
    There are lots of{old houses}in    
 Potter Street and Alderford Street.   
 Some houses are about 300 years old   
 and have wooden beams and plaster but 
 some have bricks at the bottom of the 
 house and wood and plaster at the top.
    In the countryside there are lots  
 of{farm houses}with buildings round   
 them,big gardens and three have moats.
    In Potter Street there are some    
{Alms houses}where people who couldn't 
  pay rent lived for as long as        
 they liked.These are being renovated. </content>
