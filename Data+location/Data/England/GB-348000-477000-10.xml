		<title>10Birds  Corn Mill Beetham</title>
		<content> Heron Corn Mill got its name from the 
 herons that roosted in the oakwoods   
 that once existed nearby.The oakwoods 
 were felled in the seventeenth century
 to provide timber for the Navy.The    
 displaced herons fought with the rooks
 at Dallam.The trouble lasted many     
 years,but both sides settled down to  
 live at the woods at Dallam.          
    Up in the beams of the ground floor
 ceiling there is a wrens nest.It was  
 one of several built by a cock wren   
 about four years ago.His mate had a   
 good look at it and chose the one     
 across the river.He still uses the one
 in the mill as his bachelor pad.      
    The area around the mill is very   
 rich in bird life particularly water  
 birds.
