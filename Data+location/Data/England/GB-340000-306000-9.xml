		<title>09 PONTESTURY VILLAGE</title>
		<content> The main road runs straight through   
 the middle of Pontesbury.  Traffic is 
 very noisy and extremely large, like  
 oil tankers and lorries.  It is really
 a narrow village  road and some of the
 larger traffic has become stuck on the
 corner!                               
 There is a mixture of housing in      
 Pontesbury, both Council and privately
 owned.  School Green, just off the    
 main road, is especially for elderly  
 people.  It is owner by the Council   
 who provide a Warden to look after the
 elderly.  The accommodation is chiefly
 bed-sittingrooms.                     
 A number of shops are situated close  
 by.  The Post Office and Supermarket  
 are only a few yards away.  A few     
 minutes' walk down the road is a      
 chemist,butcher, off-licence, bank and
 public house.  There is also a fine   
 looking church on the outskirts.      </content>
