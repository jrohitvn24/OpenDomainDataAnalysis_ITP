		<title>08OPINIONS OF AN OLD PERSON</title>
		<content>     Mrs Larkin is the oldest resident 
 in West Horndon. She is 95 and moved  
 here in 1957. She liked the village   
 then and still likes it now. There    
 were no shops when she moved in, but  
 pedlars came with food. There used to 
 be a factory, which made farm         
 implements. They won the Queens award 
 for industry and used to fly the      
 Queens flag.They used to hold dances  
 and a baby clinic at the canteen.They 
 used to play on the sports field and  
 now the sports field is derelict.When 
 they left, she said this was the worst
 thing that happened to the village.   
 She remembers builders collecting     
 money for the village hall which is   
 now run by the people.Mrs Larkin said 
 she thought the school was the most   
 beautiful in England, because of the  
 lovely views over the country side.
