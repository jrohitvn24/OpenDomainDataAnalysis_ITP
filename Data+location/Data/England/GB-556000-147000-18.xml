		<title>18A TEN YEAR OLD IN TONBRIDGE</title>
		<content>   My name is Claire.I am ten years old
 and have lived in Tonbridge all my    
 life.I live with my mum and dad and   
 younger brother.I don't like him much_
 he wakes me up in the morning with his
 shouting.We often fight,and although  
 he is smaller than me he normally     
 wins.                                 
  School starts at 9.00 am and ends at 
 3.30.Long Mead is a nice school with a
 big field surrounded by ash and maple 
 trees.I like it because there are only
 150 children and I have lots of       
 friends there.                        
  I have lots of free time after school
 and at weekends when I do a lot of    
 reading.On Mondays I go to band prac_ 
 tice,on Tuesdays and Fridays I go to  
 dance class,and on Thursdays I have   
 Girls' Brigade.I like living in Ton_  
 bridge.It's right by miles of country_
 side with woods,streams and farms.    </content>
