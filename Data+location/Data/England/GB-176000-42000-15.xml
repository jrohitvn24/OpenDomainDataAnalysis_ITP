		<content> About{Ten Years Ago}the milk went     
 straight from the{cooler}to the{churn.
 The{churns}were taken to the{milk     
{department}either by the{farmer's}own 
 transport or by lorries sent by the{  
{Milk Processing Company}which called  
 every morning to take away the full{  
{churns}and bring back the empty ones. 
 Modern milking parlours with milking  
 machines, pumps, refrigerated storage 
 tanks allow one person to milk{100    
{cows}at once. Some farms have{        
{computerized equipment}to help care   
 for the animals. However much work    
 machines save, people will still have 
 to operate them. Many{dairy products  
 are made into foods and{dairy produce.
 Some of  cows' milk is turned into    
 butter, cheese and{yogurt.}None of    
 the cow is wasted. The bones are used 
 for{fertilizer, petfoods}and{glue.}
