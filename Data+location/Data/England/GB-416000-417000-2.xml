		<title>02DEIGHTON A SUMMARY</title>
		<content>{DEIGHTON}is a mixture of old and new  
 housing,rented and freehold           
 property;shops,clubs,schools,services 
 and industry.It was once a small      
 textile area as is evident by         
 place-names like "Tenterhill" and     
 "Sheepridge"-not forgetting the       
 "Woolpack" pub.Another dominant       
 feature is the old "Board School"     
 built in 1876,well maintained with    
 many original features,now used as a  
 Youth and Community centre.The main   
 housing is council built in the 1930's
 and 1950's.There is a little light    
 industry in{DEIGHTON}and the Service  
 industries like Lawrence Batley's     
 large Cash and Carry warehouse,Elmsley
 and Collins Fruit and Vegetable       
 Wholesale depot,a large timber works  
 and Brockhole's Ford garage.There are 
 playing fields attached to the High   
 School and a small children's park.   </content>
