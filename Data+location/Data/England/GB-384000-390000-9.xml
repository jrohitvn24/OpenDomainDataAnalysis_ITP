		<title>09NORRIS HILL FARM</title>
		<content>  There has been a farm on this site   
 since at least 1759 and the present   
 owner has been there all his life,    
 which is well over 50 years.The farm  
 was originally 150 acres but much has 
 been sold for housing and now is only 
 24 acres.It is mainly used for pig    
 farming,over 700 animals,but it also  
 has some beef stock.Other animals     
 include goats,chickens and a 36 year  
 old horse.The main change in the farm 
 has been from dairy to meat production
 but no major changes are seen in the  
 future.Being a farmer in a built up   
 area has its problems mainly dogs     
 chasing the animals and trespassers.
