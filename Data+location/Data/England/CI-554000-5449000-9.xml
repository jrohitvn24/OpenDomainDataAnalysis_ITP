		<title>09The sand dunes  (1)</title>
		<content>   The sand dunes are known as{Les     
{Blanches Banques}and are an area that 
 has been kept largely free of         
 development so that people can use    
 them for personal recreation.  Apart  
 from the golf course, the dunes were  
 entirely open unto the early 1950s    
 when the estates in the SW corner of  
 the block were begun.  Subsequently   
 one further estate was allowed,       
 against opposition, on the north side 
 along Mont a la Brune hill.           
                                       
  {Car access}onto the dunes was       
 unrestricted until the 1970s when,    
 after an attempt at voluntary         
 restraint to stop the damaging        
 erosion, the whole area was sealed off
 to cars and a series of landscaped car
 parks provided around the periphery.
