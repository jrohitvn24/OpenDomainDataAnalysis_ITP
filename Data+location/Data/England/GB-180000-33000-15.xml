		<content>   The main travel in Flushing is the  
 Ferry                                 
   After the war in 1945 about 105     
 people would use the Flushing ferry to
 go to the docks,now only about 4      
 people use it.The ferry leaves the    
 quay on the hour and the half         
 hour.  It arrives in Falmouth at      
 quarter past the hour and quarter to  
 the hour.The ferry starts at 8.00 a.m 
 and finishes at 6.00 p.m.The ferry    
 used to take 120 people but now only  
 takes 12 people.It used to cost 1\d   
 now it costs 40p each way.            
   There are no buses to Falmouth from 
 Flushing,there never has been.Flushing
 quay was first owned by the Lord Of   
 The Manor the trefusis family.It was  
 then sold to Parker and Llydd who     
 spoilt the quay by letting big ships  
 drop boulders in Flushing.They are now
 used as cobbled streets.              </content>
