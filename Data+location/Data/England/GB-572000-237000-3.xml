		<title>03Education in Toppesfield</title>
		<content> Most children from Toppesfield and    
 Stambourne begin their education at   
 the Play Group held in Toppesfield    
 Village Hall.At the age of five they  
 go to St Margaret's C of E Primary    
 school,Toppesfield.There was a school 
 in Stambourne but it was closed down  
 because there were insufficient       
 children.Because Toppesfield school   
 was the biggest everybody had to go   
 there.The school was built in 1856 and
 was extended and modernised in        
 1980.There are 79 pupils and 3        
 teachers in the school.There is a     
 school bus that brings some children  
 free if they live over 2 miles from   
 the school and some others come on it 
 but they have to pay.At the age of 11 
 pupils go to a secondary school in    
 Hedingham about 5 miles away.  A few  
 children go to Grammar school but they
 have to travel a long way.            </content>
