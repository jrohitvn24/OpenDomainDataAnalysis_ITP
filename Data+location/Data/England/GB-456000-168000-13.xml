		<title>13BRADFIELD-CLAY HILL</title>
		<content> Clay Hill is largely farmland, woods  
 and scattered housing. The people     
 are mostly retired or self employed.  
 The member of Parliament for Newbury  
 and district Mr McNair Wilson lives   
 at Nine Elms Farm. There is a small   
 timber yard with wood working         
 machinery.All the local road sign     
 posts are made here. A furniture      
 repairer occupies a farm building.    
 Another cottage industry is chair     
 caning and repairing. Much of the     
 woodland used to be hunting woods     
 for royalty. In the woods is the      
 site of a roman camp. There are two   
 small holding farms. The rest of the  
 land is used for wheat and barley.    
 Fields are still bordered by hedges.
