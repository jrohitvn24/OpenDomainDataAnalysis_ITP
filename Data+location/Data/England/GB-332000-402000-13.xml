		<title>13THE PARK WALL-INCE BLUNDELL</title>
		<content>   The{Park Wall}was begun in{1770}and 
 is a prominent landmark in the area.  
 It is believed to have been a scheme  
 for unemployment relief. Clay for the 
 bricks was dug from pits close at     
 hand. the largest of these is now the 
 beautiful lake inside the park.Five   
 kilns were set up to bake the bricks. 
                                       
   On the wall{white crosses}are       
 painted. These mark the position of   
 wooden crosses inside the wal.At these
 points funeral processions would stop 
 to say prayers and rest on the way to 
 the cemetery.(Before the Reformation  
 this would have been at Sefton Church)
                                       
   The whole area inside the Park Wall 
 is now a Conservation area.
