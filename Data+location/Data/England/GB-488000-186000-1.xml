		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO BOURNE END</title>
		<content>The area is in the Thames Valley and   
includes the villages of Bourne End and
Wooburn.Bourne End is the more         
residential of the two,with modern     
housing  estates stretching into       
Flackwell Heath, across rolling hills  
and once fruit-filled cherry orchards. 
There are also Victorian and Edwardian 
houses and a few thatched cottages.    
Enid Blyton and  Edgar Wallace,who is  
buried in the local cemetery,both      
lived in the area.                     
Factories back onto fields and farms.  
The Abbotsbrook and Industrial estates 
are the two extremes in Bourne End,the 
latter,a few years old,whereas the     
former has outlived generations.The    
main road and railway station provide  
easy access to London and other main   
cities.The Thames is popular with      
residents and attracts tourists,who    
fish,sail and walk along the banks.    </content>
