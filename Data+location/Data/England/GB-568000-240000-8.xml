		<title>08Houses in Chapel Street.</title>
		<content> In Chapel Street there are several    
 examples of houses and cottages built 
 during the Victorian era.The{Manse}was
 bought by the Congregational Church   
 when it was sold by auction in 1879.It
 is red brick and has a slate roof.    
 During the second half of the 19th    
 century the development of rail       
 transport led to the widespread use of
 Welsh slate for all types of          
 buildings. It was much sought after as
 a substitute for inflammable thatch.  
{Eversley,}the former Chapel House was 
 originally a small residence known as 
 Vine Cottage, probably late Georgian  
 or Regency. In 1899 Mr. A. Bowtell    
 enlarged and converted the cottage to 
 its present style with bay windows at 
 the front. An interesting feature is  
 the tile hanging on one wall. When    
 clay tiles became cheap and easily    
 available they were often used thus.  </content>
