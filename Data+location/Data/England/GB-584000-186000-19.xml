		<content> Apart from the "classless" BBC style  
 pronunciationin wide use in Southend  
 there are two main styles of speaking 
 which can be said to be local         
 dialects.One is rooted in the         
 historical movement of families from  
 London's East End to the area which   
 began with the introduction in the    
 late 19th Century of the railway line 
 from Fenchurch Street.This was popular
 for cockney day trippers who speedily 
 moved into the locality.Their manner  
 of speaking is readily identifiable by
 the dropping of H's,K's,and G's and   
 the merging of TH's into F's.The other
 is also distinctive and comes from the
 farming communities in the villages   
 which surrounded the town,identifiable
 by the elongated vowel sounds and the 
 distinct pronunciation of TH's,T's and
 other consonants.
