		<title>14MEDICINES AND ILLNESSES</title>
		<content>{ Before the days of anti-biotics Dr   
{Waud of Helperby made up most of his  
{medicines himself.Few pills were      
{dispensed,mostly medicines.These were 
{put in large rectangular bottles and  
{then corked.He would then put wrapping
{paper round them and seal them with   
{sealing wax.                          
{  The medicines would be left in the  
{surgery for the patients to collect or
{the local bus would deliver them to   
{the sick person's village.            
{  Until a few years ago there were    
{some nasty illnesses to be found in   
{this area.The labourers who cut the   
{sugar beet suffered from              
{teno-synovitis which really means     
{swollen arms.Lifting their arms would 
{make them creak.They would have them  
{bandaged and rest them for a          
{week.Chest infection from hay,and     
{ringworm from cattle were also nasty. </content>
