		<title>09CUSTOMS AT HATCH BEAUCHAMP</title>
		<content>   The Flower Show is held in a marquee
 on Hatch Beauchamp playing field every
 August. It consists of many           
 competitions, mainly craft and floral 
 classes but there are a few classes   
 for vegetables as well.               
   Pancake Races are held on Shrove    
 Tuesday. The idea is that you have to 
 be first to the finishing line, after 
 running along while tossing a pancake 
 in a frying pan.                      
   On Guy Fawkes night, an enormous    
 bonfire is built and a dummy of Guy   
 Fawkes is placed on top. In the       
 evening the bonfire is lit and there  
 is a firework display.                
   Near Christmas time there is an     
 enormous supper in Hatch Beauchamp    
 village hall. There is a performance  
 by a vilage organisation and the choir
 sings some unusual carols to finish   
 off the evening.                      </content>
