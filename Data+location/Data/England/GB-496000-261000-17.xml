		<content> Souldrop was originally a{Danish      
 settlement called Souththorpe, the    
 name gradually changed over the years 
 to its present form. The earliest     
 recorded{owner}was the Bishop of      
 Coutances from Normandy in 1086 who   
 came to claim the village in company  
 with William the Conqueror.           
                                       
 Prior to the dissolution of the       
 monasteries in 1560, the land belonged
 to the Melchbourne Preceptory, a      
 monastic house of the Knights         
 Hospitallers of Saint John.           
 The area includes 350 acres of{common 
{land}enclosed by the Enclosure Act of 
 1770. It is reputed to be one of the  
 last parishes in which{serfs}were     
 employed.
