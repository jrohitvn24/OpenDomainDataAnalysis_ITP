		<title>12Transport in Longfield</title>
		<content> Most people own a car and many        
 families own two. The area has a bus  
 service run by London Country,and     
 access to Dartford,Gravesend and New  
 Ash Green is fairly easy. A service   
 between Longfield Hill and New Barn   
 runs on Fridays only.                 
 Longfield enjoys a half_hourly train  
 service to London,Victoria. The cost  
 is Â£6.40 return and the journey to    
 Victoria _ via Swanley and Bromley    
 South _ takes approximately forty     
 minutes.                              
 People working in London use this     
 service rather than driving in,and it 
 would be disastrous should the service
 cease.                                
 There is a taxi service and more      
 bicycles are to be seen on the roads. 
 Schoolchildren living in outlying     
 villages come in by coach and taxi to 
 attend the schools in Longfield.      </content>
