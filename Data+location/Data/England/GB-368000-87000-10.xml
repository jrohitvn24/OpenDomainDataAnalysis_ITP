		<title>10A Typical Modern Home</title>
		<content>    Our house is small, semi-detatched 
 and brick built with a grey tiled     
 roof.It has gas central heating and a 
 very small garden. Both my parents    
 work, but Mummy finishes at 3.30 pm   
 so that she can pick me up from school
 and cook the evening meal.During the  
 week we usually eat quickly prepared  
 convenience food cooked in the        
 microwave oven, but with fresh        
 vegetables. On Sundays we often have a
 traditional roast dinner. In the      
 evenings Mummy does some housework    
 such as ironing, while I watch        
 television and do my homework.        
 Sometimes I go out to play on my      
 roller skates or write to my brother  
 who is at boarding school.            
    Home is full of familiar objects,  
 memories, smells, sounds and people.  
 It is the place where we can relax    
 together and talk.                    </content>
