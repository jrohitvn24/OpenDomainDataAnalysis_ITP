		<content>   The St.Peter's Church and churchyard
 is well looked after. There is an     
 interesting effigy of a man and woman 
 in the church. In the churchyard one  
 of the tombs displays a skeleton. The 
 mount shown on the O.S. map is no     
 longer there but adjacent to the      
 churchyard is a large stagnant pool.  
  There are 33 members on the electoral
 roll. Many people interviewed         
 complained about the high cost of     
 living. Most of the older inhabitants 
 like the more modern conveniences such
 as central heating. The general       
 feeling of the dairy farmers is the   
 worrying time they are now            
 experiencing. Having been encouraged  
 by the EEC to build up their herds,   
 they are now being told to cut down.  
 Those people who have farmed for many 
 years have seen many changes in the   
 lifestyles of the population.         </content>
