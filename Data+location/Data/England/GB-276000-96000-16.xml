		<title>16SWIMMING POOL,Yeoford School</title>
		<content> Yeoford School swimming pool is 2.5 m 
 across and 7.5 m long. It is 230 cm   
 deep and the temperature is quite cold
 usually! Our Caretaker gets a net     
 every morning to clean out the        
 swimming pool and on very cold nights 
 she puts a cover over the swimming    
 pool. She also makes sure the swimming
 pool is safe to go in and the         
 chemicals are correct. In the summer  
 term we can swim every school day if  
 it is not too cold and we are allowed 
 to swim 6 days in the summer holiday. 
 The Playgroup are allowed to swim then
 too. The P.T.A. built the foundations 
 and the sides. The swimming pool cost 
 Â£900 to build and the P.T.A. paid most
 of that. When we do go swimming we    
 have to wear hats so that we do not   
 block up the filter. There are 46     
 children in the school and 40 can swim
 without any swimming aids.            </content>
