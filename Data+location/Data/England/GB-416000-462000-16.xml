 An interview with Mr Harold Holmes,   
 the oldest ex-pupil of Glasshouses    
 reveals that, if there was a whooping 
 cough epidemic the school would be    
 closed and the afflicted children     
 would be expected to go to the gas    
 works to breathe in the gas/lime      
 mixture.                              
 In the 1930s Mrs Herena Lonsdale and  
 Mrs Margaret Marton remember a fish   
 and chip shop, two cobblers and two   
 sweet shops in the village, whilst Mrs
 Barbara Johnson's memories of the     
 1950s and 1960s are of a village of   
 workers' cottages surrounded by       
 fields,of the last passenger train and
 the last goods' train going through ln
 1951 and 1965 repectively, of school  
 dinners being 2 shillings per week,   
 and an annual school trip to the      
 seaside or the Liverpool Docks.       </content>
