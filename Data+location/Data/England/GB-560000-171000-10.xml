		<title>10Children's Interests</title>
		<content> Some groups of girls from our school, 
 Northfleet School for Girls, visited  
 Painter's Ash and Shears Green Primary
 Schools. We wanted to find out what   
 things children aged between 9 and 11 
 were interested in. We found out that 
 their favourite hobby is football.    
 When they go out with their friends   
 they choose to go to the cinema. They 
 like casual clothes. If they could    
 spend a day with a famous person, they
 would choose the singer Madonna. Their
 favourite foods are MacDonald's       
 hamburgers, kebabs and sausages, all  
 of which are junk food. 99% of the    
 children we interviewed have potato   
 crisps at breaktime. They all like    
 chocolate and sweets, though many of  
 them are worried about getting fat.   
 The majority of the children, given   
 the choice between being boys and     
 girls, would choose to be boys!       </content>
