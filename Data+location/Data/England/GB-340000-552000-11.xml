		<content>     I am a pupil at Bishop Goodwin    
 Junior School, in Carlisle. Opposite  
 our school there is a row of terraced 
 houses. You can tell this because they
 are all joined together. On my street 
 all the houses are semi-detached. This
 means one building is split into two  
 houses. Some people have mansions.    
 They are very big houses which have   
 a lot more rooms in them than ordinary
 houses. You could fit more people into
 a mansion then in an ordinary house.  
      Sometimes if there is only one   
 person they live in a flat, because   
 one person does not need a lot of room
 and it may be less expensive to heat  
 and a lot easier to keep clean and    
 tidy. Some cities have tower blocks   
 containing many flats, but Carlisle   
 does not have any at all.
