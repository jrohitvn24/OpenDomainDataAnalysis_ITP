		<title>20The Story of Fry's Well</title>
		<content> A long time ago six Chilcompton men   
 met to discuss the running of the     
 village.There was a farmer, a vicar   
 and four other imporant men.That same 
 year there was a very hot summer and  
 the river ran dry.This caused many    
 problems.Then a young man saw a drip  
 of water near the common ground.He    
 started to dig then placed a half     
 barrel in the hole and this made a    
 watering place.So they called the     
 place after him, John Fry's Well.There
 are some cottages named after him.The 
 well is still there and still flowing.
