		<title>07ROXWELL PARISH CHURCH(CONT)</title>
		<content> The Parish Church of St.Michaels and  
 All Angels at Roxwell had Robert      
 Dowton as its first vicar. There is a 
 plaque on the North wall naming all of
 the vicars and the present one is Rev.
 M.T.Practor. On the west wal there is 
 a carving of the Last Supper and above
 it a plaque in remembrance of Douglas 
 Montague, a village notable. The font 
 is in the west of the church and the  
 altar is in the east.  It is very     
 decorative with the organ and pews for
 the choir and nearby the wooden       
 pulpit. Nearby is the memorial for    
 Wilfred Christy who owned Christy Farm
 near Roxwell.
