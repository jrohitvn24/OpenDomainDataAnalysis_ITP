		<title>13A Day in The Life of ...</title>
		<content>   Morning starts with the alarm       
 ringing at 7:00am. Breakfast consists 
 of a bowl of Kellogs Cornflakes and   
 two pieces of toast and marmalade.I   
 usually arrive at school at about     
 8:15am and start to prepare for the   
 days work.I have 10 minutes play      
 ground duty to do before school starts
 at 9:00am.As there is not ridgedly set
 timetable each morning is different   
 though work in maths and language is  
 done.Dinner at 12:00am allows for some
 time to relax and prepare for the     
 afternoon.School finishes at 3:30pm   
 for the children but I usually stay to
 about 5:30 marking work,running       
 clubs,putting up displays and         
 preparing for the next day.As my wife 
 also teaches both of us are involved  
 in getting dinner.The rest of the     
 evening is taken up with school       
 meetings,work or relaxing.            </content>
