		<title>03THE RAILWAY AT BOROUGH GREEN</title>
		<content>   The main development of {Borough    
Green} was due to  the {railway},built 
in 1874.The {station} was called       
Wrotham and {Borough Green} because    
then {Borough Green} was part of       
Wrotham.       The {railway} was built 
because farmers wanted an easy way to  
get corn to market at Maidstone. The   
single track had to go through {Borough
Green} because Wrotham was too high up 
on the North Downs for a {railway}.    
   When the {railway} here opened      
business men started {to quarry the    
sand} and ragstone because the         
{railway} enabled them to transport    
heavy loads to other places.           
  A second track was laid in 1882 and  
the {station} name changed to {BOROUGH 
GREEN} and Wrotham. (by S.Smart,J.Kelso

years).
