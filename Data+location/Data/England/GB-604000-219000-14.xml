 Redlands Aggregates wishes to extend  
 into another 60 acres of arable and   
 orchard land at Blue Crates Farm.     
 Extraction would be for 7 years at    
 165000 tonnes per annum and land would
 be returned to agricultural use.      
  Existing workings at Tenpenny Farm   
 cover more tham 50 acres with about 18
 acres left to be excavated.  Access to
 the site is via a private road to the 
 farm and material excavated is taken  
 by road to the firm's processing plant
 at Thorpe-le-Soken.                   
  Local people are objecting fearing   
 noise, dust, more heavy lorries and a 
 drop in housing values.  They also    
 object to loss of farm land and the   
 adverse visual impact.
