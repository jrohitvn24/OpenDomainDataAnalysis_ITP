{Harewood Forest is the second largest 
{ancient woodland in Hants}.In our     
 D-Block it covers 650-700 hectares and
 is owned privately by one person.The  
 soil is clay with flints over         
 chalk.The predominant species is oak, 
 with birch and some conifers.From the 
 13th Century the forest has been {    
{coppiced with standards.}This century 
 the demand for coppice wood has       
 decreased and from the 1960's a new   
 policy has been followed.{Clearances }
 totalling 145 acres have been made and
{planted with conifers. Since 1982 }the
 clearing of{10 acres}at a time has    
 been introduced and the planting of { 
{sessile oak,beech}and{ash}undertaken.
