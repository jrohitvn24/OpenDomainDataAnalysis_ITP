		<content>  Housing in this area is extremly     
 varied.The majority of houses/cottages
 are over 100 yrs old having once      
 belonged to large farms and           
 estates.The cottages have since been  
 sold and renovated by their           
 inhabitants. The houses are all       
 individual in size,shape and          
 charecter.Many cottages are made of   
 local stone and 80% are half timbered 
 framed dwellings otherwise known as   
 "Black and White" houses providing a  
 unique and picturesque area.These     
 houses were built between the 16th and
 17th century and as early as 1319.    
  The recently built dwellings tend to 
 be bungalows owned by the occupants.  
 There is one planned estate consisting
 of 10 houses on the outskirts of      
 Pembridge village.                    
  There are very few council houses in 
 this area,some cottages are rented out</content>
