		<title>16CHURCHES OF EAST WITTERING</title>
		<content>   The first church in East Wittering  
 was built in the twelth century by the
 Normans.There is a fine Norman door   
 arch.Inside the church there is random
 rubble walling where the Victorians   
 pulled the plaster off.The windows are
 more modern now but you can still see 
 the Norman arches where the old small 
 windows were.The church is quite small
 and can only seat sixty-four people.  
 The church is no longer used because  
 it is not safe but people are still   
 buried in the graveyard.St.Anne's     
 Church was built 27 years ago.It is   
 much bigger than the old church and   
 can hold two hundred people.It is very
 light and airy.There are some plain   
 windows high up and coloured glass    
 windows lower down.People from the    
 church help in the community by       
 visiting old people and helping them  
 with their shopping and other things. </content>
