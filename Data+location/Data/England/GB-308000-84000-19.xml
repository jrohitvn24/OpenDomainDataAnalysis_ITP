 block. It is popular for fishing and  
 as a place for artists to paint.      
 Herons,kingfishers and woodpeckers are
 among the birds that can be seen near 
 the river. Near the Church is a large 
 rookery.                              
  Here you can find the weir that      
 provides water for the Mill leat. This
 still works and the{Mill}is very      
 active.                               
  There is a footpath all along the    
 river bank and many people enjoy      
 walking in this beautiful area.       
  There is an{Otter Valley Association 
 whose aims are to protect the beauties
 and amenities of this area. It is     
 widely supported by the retired       
 population of the E. Devon area.
