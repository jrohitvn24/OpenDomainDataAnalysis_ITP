		<title>15Social Life and the Tavern.</title>
		<content> The social hub of the community is the
 Tavern.Recently the area has been     
 altered to accomodate the Stores at   
 one end and to provide a meeting place
 which is always open -even when the   
 bar is closed.In a newly created      
 gallery above the bar section there   
 are restaurant facilities.            
 In the 1960's there were 2 fruit      
 machines but happily these have now   
 gone.There is a pool table above the  
 Stores.Barbecues and other events tend
 to be impromptu. At Christmas a       
 service is held in the Tavern and a   
 Christmas dinner.                     
 In 1984 a small brewery was started.  
 It usually produces'2 barrel brews'   
 which is 72 gallons a time.The main   
 product is Puffin Ale (sometimes known
 as Puffin's Purge).The distinctive    
 taste and other qualities probably    
 derive from the peaty water.          </content>
