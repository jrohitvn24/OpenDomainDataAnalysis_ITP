		<content> Woke up 06.30.Going to York with      
 Tebay Women's Institute on our annual 
 outing.The coach was to leave at 09.30
 After breakfast and seeing my family  
 off to their Gran's I arrived in time 
 for the coach.The sun was shining but 
 the journey was rather long &amp; by the  
 time we arrived (1230) we were all    
 ready for lunch. After an enjoyable   
 meal we went to Jorvik Viking Centre. 
 waited 20 minutes before our turn.We  
 'travelled back in time' a 1000 years.
 A lot of specimens and the whole      
 village had been unearthed under York.
 Took a taxi to York Minster(Â£1.20) but
 we couldn't visit the South Tower due 
 to a recent fire.There were tourists  
 mainly Americans and Germans.         
 Everywhere musicians and Morris       
 Dancers entertained the crowds.
