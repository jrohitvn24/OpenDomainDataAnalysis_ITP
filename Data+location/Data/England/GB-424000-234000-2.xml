		<title>02Origins of the Wolfords</title>
		<content> The origins of the name Wolford are   
 thought to be unique. It first        
 appeared as Ulware or Ulwarde, then as
 Wolwarde in the Domesday Book. By 1242
 in the Book of Fees the two Wolfords  
 were in existance - Wulleward Magna   
 and Wulleward Parva. The two elements 
 of the name seem to be Old English for
 'Wolf' and "Weard", meaning guard, so 
 the name could have come into being   
 because this was an area 'enclosed to 
 protect flocks from wolves'. Since    
 there are physical remains of early   
 earthworks on the north side of Great 
 Wolford perhaps one could take this as
 corroborative evidence that Wolford   
 did mean 'Protected area'. The present
 spelling of Todenham appeared in 1291 
 in the Taxatio Eccleseastica. Earlier 
 in the Domesday Book it was Teodeham  
 and was probably originally Teodas    
 Hamm or Ham.                          </content>
