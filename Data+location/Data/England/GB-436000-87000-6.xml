		<content> The old school remained but in the    
 grounds which led down to the sea some
 very expensive new houses were being  
 built. Only very rich people, we      
 thought, would be able to afford them.
   Still further eastwards along the   
 road was Ningwood Common. Here along a
 long bumpy, stoney road were several  
 rather old bungalows. Most were made  
 of wood, were well apart from each    
 other and had very big gardens.
