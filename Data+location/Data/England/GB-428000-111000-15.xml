		<title>15Mrs. Howard of Golden Hayes</title>
		<content> Mrs Howard has lived at Golden Hayes  
 since 1939.  The family nanny stayed  
 on to help after the children had     
 grown up.                             
                                       
 She remembers how everybody used to   
 wear a hat. When her mother met the   
 family cook in the village one day,   
 without a hat on, she told her she    
 must never go out again without a hat.
                                       
 The grocer called on Mondays for      
 orders, and delivered on Fridays.  The
 baker, butcher, milkman, fishmonger   
 and greengrocer called each week.     
                                       
 Mrs Howard recalls Sundays with       
 special clothes, going to church, no  
 playing of games, only reading,a      
 special Sunday lunch and singing hymns
 around the piano after tea.
