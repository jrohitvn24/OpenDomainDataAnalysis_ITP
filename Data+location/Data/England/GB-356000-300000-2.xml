		<content>   Kenley is interesting for the fact  
 that Archibald Alison was rector      
 there.  He wrote the book "Essay on   
 the Nature and Principles of Tastle"  
 and was a close friend of Thomas      
 Telford, after whom the new town of   
 Telford is named.  These two men      
 played bowls together in the Kenley   
 area when they had time.  The Rector's
 son was born at Kenley and he became a
 judge, writing works on law and a 10  
 volume history of Europe.  Page six   
 tells a little more about Kenley      
 Church where Sir Archibald Alison was 
 REctor.  In the church is a tablet    
 which is dedicated to the memory of   
 this Rector. After leaving Kenley,    
 Alison became minister of a church in 
 Edinburgh.
