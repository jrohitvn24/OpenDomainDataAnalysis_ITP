		<title>03Occupations in S.Clifton</title>
		<content> Apart from farming,there is a wide    
 range of employment in the area.This  
 is probably because the pleasant      
 village atmoshere provides suitable   
 housing for people who work in nearby 
 towns or travel around the            
 area.Employment in villages is also   
 available in two chicken farms,a      
 market garden,a nursing home and a    
 garage.Other occupations of people    
 include engineers,teachers,sales      
 people,nurses,a bus driver, a lorry   
 driver,power station workers,miners   
 and cleaners.As in most areas today   
 there are some unemployed people and  
 several retired families.There are two
 Riding Stables providing leisure time 
 pursuits.There are only two shops in  
 the area .One in South Clifton and one
 in Low Marnham.There is also a Post   
 Office in South Clifton.
