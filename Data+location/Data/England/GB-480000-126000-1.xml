		<content> this 12 square kilometre block        
 consists mainly of the milland valley 
 which is a depression surrounded by   
 small hills the highest of which is   
 183m above sea level and the lowest   
 part of the valley is 50m. the        
 northern hills are a watershed and    
 several streams flow offit southwards 
 towards the river rother. the valley  
 is classified as an area of natural   
 beauty with large areas of farm and   
 woodland. the soil is mainly clay. to 
 the north of the hills the land       
 completely changes. the land remains  
 at the higher level and has sandy     
 soil with large areas of rough common 
 land. this area is cut by the main A3 
 london to portsmouth road and the     
 railway line, just including liphook  
 station. this area extends into       
 hampshire, the rest being in sussex.
