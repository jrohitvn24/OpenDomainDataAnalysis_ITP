		<content>  We did a survey of 5 nurseries.They  
all grew a variety of flowers and      
vegetables.All had greenhouses;one had 
14,one had 2 and one had 4.The other 2 
nurseries had 1/2 acre of glass and 6  
acres of glass.                        
  They did not sell other things except
1 who also sold seeds,and another      
selling straw and hay.                 
  3 nurseries sold there products on   
the site,2 sold them to shops and      
markets and the others sold them to a  
flower wholesaler,garden centres and   
the new Covent Garden market.          
  The nurseries also employed          
different numbers of workers.1 was just
a family concern,the others employed 1,
2,4 and 40 workers,with some casual and
part time workers as well.
