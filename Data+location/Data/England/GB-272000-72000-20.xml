		<title>20BUCKLAND VILLAGE DARTMOOR</title>
		<content>      Buckland-in-the-Moor was         
 Bochelanda in the {Domesday Book.}We  
 were told that the village is not as  
 tidy as it used to be as residents get
 into their cars and go off for the day
 We walked  between dry stone walls    
 bright with foxgloves,woodvetch,cow   
 parsley and dandelions,onto the moor, 
 where heather was blooming and sheep  
 and wild Dartmoor ponies grazing,and  
 climbed to Buckland Beacon where the  
 Ten Commandments were carved to       
 celebrate Parliament's rejection of   
 the new Prayer Book in 1924.To the    
 West we looked down on{Buckland-in-the
{Moor.}To the East we looked down to   
 the coast and could see the tower and 
 the spire of the churches of St.Mary  
 church.We knew that Cuthbert Mayne    
 Comprehensive,our school,was just     
 below them. We had driven the 14 miles
 from Torquay often to do this survey. </content>
