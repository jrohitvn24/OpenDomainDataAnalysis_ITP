		<title>05A typical Saturday</title>
		<content> At about 8am on Saturday morning I get
 up.I put the television on and watch  
 Wide Awake Club or Saturday Picture   
 Show.Then the rest of the family gets 
 up.At about 9am I get my breakfast    
 which is Ready Brek and a cup of tea.I
 then go for my friend Mo,but sometimes
 he goes to work with his dad,so I play
 with Anthony and Mark.We sometimes    
 play football in Mo's yard.He usually 
 goes in goal.At about 10.30 we go in  
 the pit,our local play area.We        
 sometimes go on the obstacle course on
 the wooden frames.Then I get my bike  
 out and we go for some sweets and a   
 comic.After dinner all the little kids
 come out.We play a game called        
 'tracking'.The other kids come after  
 us.That games lasts about 3 hours then
 it is time for tea.After tea I watch  
 television until it is time for bed.I 
 go to bed at about 11pm.              </content>
