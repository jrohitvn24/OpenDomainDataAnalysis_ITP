		<title>19HISTORY OF GIMORTON</title>
		<content> The village is in the Domesday Book   
 and is called "Mortons". The entry    
 reads that in Gilmorton wapentake     
 Robert of Vessey holds Gilmorton from 
 the King and Godfrey from him. The    
 value of the land was 10 shillings    
 before 1066 and 40 shillings by the   
 time of the Domesday Survey in        
 1085.Sometime after the Survey Mortons
 acquired the prefix of "Goldinge" or  
 Gildinge". It is thought that this    
 addition to the name was due to an    
 abundance of a weed called "golding"  
 or "gilding", growing in the area, a  
 weed natural to the soil and ruinous  
 to the corn. It had a yellow flower,  
 hence the name "golding". The lordship
 was enclosed in 1777 and Sir Wolstan  
 Dixie was Lord of the manor, but owned
 only a small proportion of the land.  
 The principal landowners were the     
 Chandler family.                      </content>
