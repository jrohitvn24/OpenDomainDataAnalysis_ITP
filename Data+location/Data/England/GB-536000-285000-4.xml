		<content>    Whitworth's Food Group started as  
 a private company about 20 years ago. 
 Early in 1985 it became a public      
 company. Its present location is at   
 the northern end of Chatteris.        
    There are approximately{280 people 
 working at Whitworth's. Of these about
{75% are female, 25% are male workers. 
 Many of these come from outside of    
 Chatteris e.g. Wimblington and March. 
    Apart from those involved in the   
 packing itself e.g. packers, forklift 
 drivers, production managers, there   
 are lorry drivers and mechanics and a 
 range of office staff.                
    The firm packs vegetables such as  
 potatoes, onions, carrots. Fruit is   
 bought and distributed but not packed.
 Local farmers supply a lot of the     
 produce. They also have their own     
 co-operative for storage. Out of      
 season produce is purchased abroad.   </content>
