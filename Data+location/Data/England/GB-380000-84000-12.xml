		<title>12MANOR HOUSE</title>
		<content> The Parochial Church Council  have    
 appointed a village warden who walks  
 round once a week picking up rubbish  
 and keeping the village tidy.         
 A village trail starts at the village 
 church,and follows round to important 
 places in the village.                
 The oldest house in the village is a  
 late Elizabethan Manor House.The front
 was restyled in the Georgian Times.   
 There are huge cellars underneath in  
 which prisoners stayed during a heavy 
 snowstorm,during the war between the  
 Parliamentarians and Royalists.The    
 triumphant troops were leading their  
 Royalist Prisoners back to Dorchester 
 Prison when they were halted by the   
 snow.                                 
 Mr. and Mrs.Teychenne now live there. 
 Mr.Teychenne is a sculptor and some of
 his work can be seen in the church.
