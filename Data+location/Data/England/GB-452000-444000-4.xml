		<content> Bilbrough before 1939.                
                                       
 There are many older people in the    
 village now,some of whom have spent   
 most of their lives here.             
 Miss Atkinson aged 89 and Mrs Totty   
 aged 77 live together at Rose Cottage.
 They were born here.There were no new 
 houses then.In 1939 the Lycett Green  
 family lived in the Manor, and there  
 was a full staff of servants.Most of  
 the villagers worked for them.There   
 was a post office and a shop and an   
 orphanage.There was a smithy and a    
 waterworks.All these have gone.       
 The houses and the church were lit by 
 oil lamps and candles.Electricity was 
 brought to the village after the war. 
 Main sewerage was installed in the    
 1950s.These ladies remember this work 
 taking place.
