		<title>15EGGINTON HORTICULTURAL SHOW</title>
		<content> The Horticultural Show in Egginton is 
 run by the members of the Egginton    
 Horticultural Society for members,    
 villagers and anyone who wishes to    
 enter. The show is always held at the 
 beginning of September in the Memorial
 Hall, which is also the main school   
 building. For the past few years the  
 children have had their own special   
 classes, which have included such     
 things as paintings, baking and       
 growing sunflowers. Other classes are 
 grouped into either open, for         
 everyone, or closed, for society      
 members only. They include sections   
 for fruit, vegetables, flowers and a  
 domestic section for jams, wine,      
 preserves and baking.
