		<content>  There are only two shops in the      
 village, although a few years ago     
 there was a third small shop near the 
 windmill, serving the other end of the
 village. These two shops are both     
 multi-purpose, the most central one in
 Crow Road being a Post Office cum     
 General Store, selling food, hardware,
 stationery and some clothing. The     
 second shop is the Off Licence, which 
 also sells some groceries. The        
 proprieter has a workshop adjoining   
 the shop, where he repairs lawn-mowers
 and chain-saws. There is also a large 
 public house here, officially named   
 "The Rayleigh Arms", but commonly     
 called "The Monkey". There are two    
 mobile shops, also a paper round which
 serve the area. However, the majority 
 of the villagers tend to shop in      
 Chelmsford or Witham, especially since
 the hypermarkets have been built.     </content>
