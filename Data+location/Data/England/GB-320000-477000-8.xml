 describe his working life in which he 
 served industry in the trade of       
 electrician. Having recently taken up 
 retirement his interest has now turned
 to golf following on his active       
 support in cricket and football,      
 facilities for these sports being     
 provided in both Askam and Ireleth    
 with the nearby golf course of        
 Dunnerholme providing all the         
 requirements of the golfing fraternity
 resident and visitors.These particular
 golf links are popular not only       
 because of the interesting round but  
 also for the panoramic views of the   
 Lake District Fells and the Duddon    
 Estuary and Irish Sea. His interest is
 also in the Local Rugby Club which    
 have good facilities. He does,however,
 regret the loss of the bowling green.
