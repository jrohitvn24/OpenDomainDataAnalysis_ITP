		<title>13EMPLOYMENT IN GREENFORD</title>
		<content> 30 of the people we went out and asked
 were employed and 25 were not. Maybe  
 most workers were at work. 15 of the  
 unemployed were women. Most people    
 blamed the government for             
 unemployment. 10 of the people that   
 worked liked their job; mostly these  
 were office jobs, police and teachers.
 17 people worked in Greenford and the 
 other 13 mostly in Southall, Ealing or
 Hounslow. Half of those working had   
 been unemployed before. Some people   
 only took the job that they had now   
 because they couldn't find any other  
 job. Some people had not applied for  
 new jobs because they did not want to 
 work any more because of they felt too
 old or else they had a child to look  
 after. Mostly teenagers were looking  
 for a job, especially one with lots of
 money. Some had not taken the chance  
 of a job because of distance or pay.  </content>
