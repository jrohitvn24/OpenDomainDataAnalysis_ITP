 The actual date the house was built is
 not known. In a book called "Buildings
 of England" by Bevsler, it is stated  
 that it was built in 1723 but this    
 cannot be proved. It is known,        
 however, that the barn was built in   
 1814 and the Coach House in 1825. The 
 house was originally called Comers    
 Halt but was changed to Inham Hall in 
 the late 1860's, by the Peckovers. The
 reason for this was that the land     
 immediately behind the house was      
 called Inham Field. The original house
 was three cornered and the western    
 section was built much later. The     
 whole front of the house has also been
 changed since the original building.  
 Previous owners of the house include  
 the Williamsons-who later moved to the
 Manor House. The Clarkes, the present 
 owners, have been there since 1917.   </content>
