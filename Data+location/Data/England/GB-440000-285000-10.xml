		<title>10Before School</title>
		<content> I get up at 8.00am. I usually have    
 cornflakes for my{BREAKFAST}followed  
 by toast and coffee. Our house is     
 about 3 minutes walk from school and  
 if I leave at 8.40am., I might go to  
 Mitchell's{STORES}where I buy some    
 crisps. They also sell magazines,     
 newspapers and all kinds of{GROCERIES.
 I usually get to school about 15      
 minutes before 9.00am. and in the     
 summer time we play marbles before the
 school bell goes.                     
 In our{MARBLES}games we make shallow  
 saucer shaped hollows in the ground   
 which we call the pot. You throw the  
 marble as close to the pot as you can 
 get it. Then the other person throws  
 his marble and if it goes nearer or in
 the pot that means they go first and  
 try to pot both marbles. The person   
 who has the best shot will win all the
 marbles on the ground or in the pot.  </content>
