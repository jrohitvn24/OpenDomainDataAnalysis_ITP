		<content>      There is a{doctor's surgery}in   
 Wetwang.This is a group practice and  
 the doctors are Doctor Fowler,Doctor  
 Clark,Doctor Crawford and Doctor      
 Gauntlett.The surgery is in Doctor    
 Fowler's house in Main Street.There   
 is a surgery every day except Thursday
 and Sunday.The doctors also act as    
 dispensers and so you can get your    
 medecine from them when you visit the 
 surgery instead of having to go to    
 Driffield to a chemist.               
                                       
       In the village there is a       
{policeman's}house.This is between     
 Main Street and York Road.You can     
 recognise it by the blue sign at the  
 door.We have a policeman called       
 P.C.Noble and if you have a problem   
 like a lost pet he will help you.If   
 there is an emergency then you are    
 transferred to Driffield or Beverley. </content>
