		<title>02LAND USE IN THE LOCAL AREA</title>
		<content> The land in this area is mainly used  
 for intensive arable especially       
 vegetable growing.The land is very    
 flat and therefore the fields are     
 regular,being divided by ditches.The  
 land was originally reclaimed from the
 marsh and therefore,being expensive,  
 there are small fields in which crops 
 are grown which have a high return.   
 Black,peaty soil overlying sand and   
 boulder clay covers the area,making it
 very rich farming land.Barley is the  
 chief crop in this area,followed by   
 wheat,a small number of fields contain
 oats.Lettuces,potatoes and onions form
 the main vegetable crops,with some    
 cabbages and carrots also being grown.
 Intensively managed grass is also     
 grown,the number of wheat fields      
 equalling the number containing hay or
 silage.Nearer to the town is a very   
 small amount of enclosed rough grass. </content>
