		<title>11SHOPPING IN WHITEHAVEN.</title>
		<content> Any article that a person may need can
 be bought in Whitehaven.There are     
 chain stores as well as the smaller   
 family founded shops. Many people     
 think that the car parking facilities 
 are inadequate &amp; those that are there 
 are too expensive.Although many items 
 bought in local shops are dearer than 
 in larger shops further afield,they   
 are situated close enough to the      
 denser populated areas to be          
 convenient. Until the recent opening  
 of Presto the Co_op was the largest   
 supermarket in Whitehaven.As well as  
 foodstuffs the Co_op sells household  
 goods,toys &amp; clothes.140 people are   
 employed at the Co_op.R.D.C Longridge 
 of Preston is the main supplier of    
 goods. A bright,airy cafe is an ideal 
 place for housewives to rest and chat 
 between selecting and paying for their
 purchases.                            </content>
