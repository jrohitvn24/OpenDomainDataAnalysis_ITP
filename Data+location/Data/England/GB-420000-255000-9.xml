		<title>09Monroe Devis Maternity Home</title>
		<content> Health.The Monroe Devis is a maternity
 home run by the Health Authority.It   
 has 3 wards and 3 delivery rooms and  
 can cater for up to 20 babies at one  
 time.There are 24 nurses who are      
 mostly part time, as well as domestic,
 cleaning,and gardening staff.The      
 babies can stay with their mothers at 
 all times and are fed on demand.The   
 Home still uses terry towelling       
 nappies and Infa-care when the babies 
 are bathed.The babies who are not     
 breast-fed have prepared cows' milk   
 and sugared boiled water.The Home is  
 due to close late in 1985.There has   
 been a strong protest movement but to 
 no avail.The patients will be moved to
 the Warneford Hospital in Leamington  
 where 4 extra beds will be provided to
 make a total of 52.The Warneford has  
 an anaesthetist and a paediatrician,  
 but will it be as pleasant?           </content>
