		<title>03Pencombe and the tourist</title>
		<content> Pencombe is well off the beaten track 
 being three miles from the nearest    
 main road. The approach roads are     
 narrow and twisting but the visitor is
 rewarded by finding a village almost  
 completely unspoilt. Attractive       
 whitewashed stone cottages border a   
 small green and stream. The beauty and
 isolation attract tourists who stay in
 holiday cottages at Marston or at     
 the  Caravan Club site at Sparrington.
 Others will visit the area for the    
 outstanding views from the surrounding
 hills. Welsh and English counties can 
 be seen to the west from the road     
 between Great Hegdon and The Nash and 
 to the south there are views towards  
 the river Severn and the Cotswolds.   
 Anglers can enjoy coarse fishing at   
 New House Farm and rambling and       
 cycling clubs are fond of the area.
