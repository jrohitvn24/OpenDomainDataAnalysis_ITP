		<title>07CHILDREN'S DOMESDAY THOUGHTS</title>
		<content>  Working on the Domesday Project has  
 been O.K. but teachers can get on your
 nerves when they do everything        
 wrong.  It does have it's uses like   
 being interviewed by the Radio &amp; the  
 Evening Argus Newspaper.Here is what  
 two of the girls thought of it all.   
 Claire Brown: aged 12                 
   "We were  photographed by the       
 Evening Argus &amp; told to sit in all    
 these different posistions .It was    
 alright though as we were outside     
 everyone got in the way.All in all it 
 was a great experience &amp; I'll never   
 forget it !"                          
 Katie Wares: aged 12                  
 Most people have enjoyed the Project  
 and nearly everything to do with it.  
 One boy who was interviewed by Radio  
 Brighton said,"At least we know where 
 the pubs are ,but we didn't like all  
 the walking ! "                       </content>
