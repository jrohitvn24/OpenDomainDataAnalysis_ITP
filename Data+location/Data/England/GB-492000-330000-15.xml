		<content> We visited Saltersford water treatment
 plant to study,how the water of the   
 Witham is treated to make it          
 drinkable.Saltersford does in fact    
 take water from two other sources as  
 well as the river Witham.They are     
 Cringle brook( a stream originating   
 from the Stoke Rochford area) and     
 Rutland water.                        
   LIsa O'boyle 1m."First we saw the   
 large reservoir which holds 7 million 
 gallons of water.It is pumped to the  
 main treatment building where it is   
 screened and chlorine is added.It then
 goes through a super pulsator,which   
 takes out the small particles.It then 
 passes through 6 filters.After this   
 the water is drinkable and is pumped  
 to three storage reservoirs around    
 Grantham.We were shown the safety     
 equipment in the event of a chlorine  
 leak."                                </content>
