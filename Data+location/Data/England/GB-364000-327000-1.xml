		<title>01GAZETEER STOKE ON TERN</title>
		<content> Our area is very rural.It has one     
 major road and many small country     
 lanes.There are two villages:Stoke on 
 Tern and Wistanswick.One school serves
 two villages.There is a public bus    
 service but most families travel by   
 car.The land is fairly flat.On the    
 western side the fields are mostly    
 planted with crops.The farmers grow   
 corn(barley and wheat),potatoes,oil   
 seed rape,some peas and sugar         
 beet.Towards the east the land        
 changes.Here the fields are mainly    
 rough grazing and common land.The     
 field boundaries are of hedges and    
 trees.There are many small woods and  
 ponds dotted about.Some farmers keep  
 livestock as well.The most important  
 are dairy cattle,pigs,and beef cattle,
 with some sheep. Poultry farming is   
 very common.Eggs are a big part of our
 diet.                                 </content>
