     The pupils at Lady Anne Cheyne    
{School}for Girls are aged between 9   
 and 13.                               
     Many of the girls who attend      
 the school live in the surrounding    
 area although a number travel from    
 Leysdown, Minster, Eastchurch and     
 Queenborough by public{transport.}This
 means an early start has to be made by
 those who live at the far end of the  
 Isle of Sheppey which is twelve miles 
 away.                                 
     It is because of the transport    
 problems that{clubs}are held during   
 the lunch break rather than after     
 school unless by special arrangement. 
     Competitions against other schools
 both on and off the{island}take place 
 throughout the year in a variety of   
 activities.
