WHOSE SIVE REFLECTS THE SIZE OF THE    
COMMUNITY,THIS DOES APPLY TO THE CHURCH
OF SAINT JOHNS AT BIDDISHAM.IT IS      
SITUATED IN THE CENTRE OF THE          
STRAGGLING VILLAGE ON A ROAD WHICH     
LEADS NOWHERE.                         
   THE CHURCH HAS OBVIOUSLY BEEN BUILT 
IN STAGES,MOSTLY OF LOCAL LIMESTONE.THE
LOWER PART OF THE TOWER AND THE        
CHANCEL ARCH DATE FROM THE THIRTEENTH  
CENTURY.THE REMAINDER WAS BUILT IN     
1860.

PEOPLE.THE WALLS ARE WHITE,CONTRASTING 
WITH THE BROWN WOOD OF THE ROOF.       
   IT IS A PLEASING BUILDING WHICH IS  
OBVIOUSLY WELL USED.
