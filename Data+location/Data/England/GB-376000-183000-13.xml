		<title>13OUR FARM IN HORTON</title>
		<content> My Daddy keeps a dairy farm.At this   
 time  of year we are trying to make   
 hay but at the moment it is raining   
 too much. Daddy and Grampy milk the   
 cows at six o'clock in the morning and
 at night.When the milk lorry comes the
 milk man writes a ticket to tell us   
 how much milk. He knows what to write 
 because he can read it on the dip-    
 stick.Hay is kept in a barn.You make  
 hay with a baler and sledge.We pick it
 up with a flat-eight. Sometimes I get 
 up in the barn with Dad. We bring the 
 hay into the barn with tractors and   
 trailers.When the hay is high we use  
 an elevator.In the Winter we give hay 
 to the young cows. We go out on the   
 tractor to give the calves some hay.  
 Sometimes we find calves in ditches. A
 month ago we made a cow shed where we 
 can put cows and hay in the Winter.
