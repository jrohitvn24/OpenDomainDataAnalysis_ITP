		<title>03 RUGBY LEAGUE IN HULL</title>
		<content> The city of Hull is famous for its two
 rugby teams. Their names are Hull FC  
 and Hull Kingston Rovers. Hull FC have
 a reputation for good support in      
 the world of rugby league.  They      
 have an average gate of around 10,000.
 Hull KR's is around  8,500. This      
 1984-85 season has been good for Hull 
 KR for they have won the  League      
 Championship Cup and the John Player  
 Trophy and being runners up in the    
 Yorkshire Cup and the Premiership     
 Trophy.                               
                                       
 With such large support rugby         
 league is obviously very important to 
 Hull people. The reason for its       
 popularity is to a large extent       
 historical and partly because it is   
 introduced at the early age of ten in 
 many schools. It seems a              
 self generating system.               </content>
