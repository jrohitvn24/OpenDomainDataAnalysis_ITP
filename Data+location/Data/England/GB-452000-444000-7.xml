		<content> Farming and its subsidiaries was and  
 is the main source of employment in   
 the area.Today the farms do not need  
 many workers except for seasonal      
 helpers for fruit picking.Many buyers 
 come to pick their own strawberries,  
 raspberries and blackcurrants.        
 Temporary car parks are made in the   
 fields.Two farms specialise in soft   
 fruits - one as a main activity, one  
 as a subsidiary.                      
 There are a number of small farms in  
 Bilbrough and Colton.The chief crops  
 are barley and wheat, although oil    
 seed rape, potatoes and sugar beet are
 grown.There are two dairy farms, one  
 in Bilbrough and one in Colton.The    
 latter supplies local needs.One       
 Bilbrough farmer has intensified pig  
 production.The agricultural college   
 has land for cereal experimentation.
