 street, following the course of the   
 River Wear from West to East.  It     
 widens out at the East end to enclose 
 the original{village green.} Most of  
 the houses are built of stone, and    
 some have small gardens in front.  To 
 the South there are a few{terraces}of 
 houses.  At either end of the village 
 are{council house estates,}Westfield  
 and Stockley Grove, all with gardens. 
 There are housing clusters at Hill    
 End, Bridge End, Bishopley and White  
 Kirkley and Whitfield Brow. Isolated  
 medieval{farms,}post-Enclosure 18th   
 century farms, with the long house    
 facing South, &amp; incorporating barns,&amp; 
 19th century detached farmhouses are  
 found.Only a few houses, including{old
{people's bungalows}have been built in 
 recent years;except for infilling,
