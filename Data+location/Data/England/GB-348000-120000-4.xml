		<title>04FARMING-BURLINGHAM FARM</title>
		<content>}The farmer lives in an old farmhouse  
 made of Hamstone and painted          
 white,except around the windows which 
 are left as unpainted Hamstone.The    
 house was mullioned,leaded windows and
 blue stone slabs have been used for   
 the fence.The garden is somewhat      
 overgrown,with some fruit trees,and   
 bushes.The farm is mainly             
 livestock,with sheep and              
 cattle,including Fresians.The farmer  
 believes in keeping his hedges,as the 
 area is flat and windy and thus they  
 act as windbreaks,as well as          
 preserving some of the wildlife.The   
 newly built dual carriageway is a     
 mixed blessing,providing faster travel
 but also destroying many hedgerows.
