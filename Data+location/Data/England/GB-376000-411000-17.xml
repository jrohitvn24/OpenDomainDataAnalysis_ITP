 Century.In 1715 it was a mansion owned
 by Thomas Nuttall.In 1918 Tottington  
 Council bought it and made it into the
 Town Hall until 1974.There are 9285   
 books altogether borrowed at a rate of
 640 a week.There are three staff, one 
 works both in Ramsbottom and          
 Tottington.The building was in very   
 poor condition, and repair work       
 started on 14:1:1985, and is due to   
 finish by September 1985.It would be  
 used as a library on the ground floor 
 and meeting rooms on the first. When  
 it is finished it will cost Â£123 000.

 daily on the site.They work 39 hours a
 week and rarely get overtime.The most 
 expensive jobs are heating, electrical
 work and joinery.
