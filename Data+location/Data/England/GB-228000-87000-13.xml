		<content> Transport a problem. Wives who cannot 
 drive cannot shop.One village bus runs
 once weekly.Buying clothes,toys and   
 home equipment by mail order is common
 Most school leavers buy a motor-cycle,
 a great worry to parents as roads are 
 narrow and visibility poor.A young boy
 of 16 died after colliding with a     
 cattle truck. Villagers turned out in 
 force,chapel was overflowing, service 
 was relayed to several hundred outside
 Families are close,much liaison       
 between grandparents, aunts, uncles   
 and cousins who grow up together,some 
 inter-marry.Some children attend the  
 primary schools their parents went to.
 Fathers role is as bread winner,mother
 takes charge of the children.Family   
 visits to the moors and beach are more
 common.The Social Services provides   
 hot meals daily to pensioners  and    
 also runs a home help service.        </content>
