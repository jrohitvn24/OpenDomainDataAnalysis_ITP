		<content> The main features of this square are  
 the two farms Demense and Bell        
 House.The land here slopes gradually  
 from west to east and is in direct    
 contrast to the Mirehouse estates,    
 being rural and sparsely populated.The
 main road link between St.Bees and    
 Whitehaven runs north to south.       
 Both farms are quite old and have     
 family links which stretch            
 considerably,Demense farm being in the
 same family since the 1700's.Demense  
 has 3/8 of its acreage(413 acres)given
 over to barley growing and            
 concentrates on beef cattle and sheep 
 production.Bell House while being     
 roughly half the size of Demense with 
 a further 40 acres rented at Bigrigg  
 concentrates more on pig farming.2    
 acres are used to grow potatoes,but   
 most is cultivated to make hay.
