		<content>{CLIMATE}AND WEATHER.The Constantine   
 area has mild winters with not much   
 snow or heavy frosts.We have an early 
 spring and sheltered valleys,so the   
 area is known for early crops and     
 bulbs.We have long warm summers,      
 although cloud often gathers          
 spasmodically during the day and there
 are frequent showery days.Constantine 
 often has different weather conditions
 to surrounding areas, e.g local mist  
 especially in the morning and evening 
 The high places in this area catch the
 east winds but prevailing wind is     
 south westerly.ANIMALS,foxes breed    
 alot in this areaand hunting is very  
 popular.Rabbits are plentiful so there
 is much shooting which helps keep them
 down. Badgers,are often seen and tip  
 over our bins looking for food.Bats   
 appear in the summer at twilight and  
 dive  across the lanes.Frogs are found</content>
