		<title>16AN EMPLOYEE AT THE HOSPITAL</title>
		<content> I reside in the nearby village of     
 Grove (not part of the survey region) 
 and Iam employed at Rampton Special   
 Hospital as an Occupations Assistant. 
 I work with female patients who are   
 mentally handicapped.My work involves 
 teaching and supervising crafts, art  
 and drama therapy, music, and general 
 social skills training.               
    The attitudes of many local people 
 towards the hospital and its inmates  
 tend to be somwehat unsympathetic and 
 fearful.This is probably due to the   
 fact that there is little             
 understanding of the nature of many   
 mental conditions.                    
    Facilities for the patients and    
 staff are very good, and the hospital 
 offers secure employment and          
 relatively good salary levels.        
                                       
                                       </content>
