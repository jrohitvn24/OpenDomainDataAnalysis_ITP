		<title>10EMPLOYMENT IN BOURNE</title>
		<content>   Ninety children were asked about    
 their{fathers' jobs}and we found that 
 the two most popular jobs were        
 builders and lorry drivers.Next came  
 carpenters,mechanics,farmers and farm 
 workers and local services like       
 ambulance drivers and policemen.      
  {In June 1985, 500 people were out of
{work}in the Bourne area.This is partly
 because of the increased number of    
 machines used on the farms and partly 
 because firms in Bourne and the       
 surrounding towns have closed down or 
 decreased output owing to the         
 recession.Although so many people were
 out of work, the average amount of    
 pocket money was Â£1 per week.         
   To help ease unemployment,Bourne has
 an{industrial}area,which is steadily  
 growing,to the east of the town.The   
 area includes a brewery,carpentry firm
 and a farm machinery assembly company.</content>
