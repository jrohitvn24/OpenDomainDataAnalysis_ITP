		<title>05Few amenities in Glastonbury</title>
		<content> Discontent amongst the young people of
 Glastonbury appears largely due to    
{boredom. }The town of Street, two     
 miles to the South, has a{cinema,}a   
{theatre,}and{two swimming pools;}but  
 Glastonbury with approximately the    
 same population has none of these     
 facilities.  Although it is possible  
 to walk or cycle this distance, the   
 fact that all these amenities are in  
 the next town strikes many of the     
 townspeople (particularly the young)  
 as unfair.  The bus service which runs
 to Street, departs only once in every 
 hour and the last bus frequently      
 departs before the cinema or theatre  
 closes.  The cost of the busfare also 
 seems to be astronomically expensive  
 to the locals.  The youth clubs cater 
 for those up to sixteen years old,    
 then there is little entertainment    
 apart from visits to Public Houses.   </content>
