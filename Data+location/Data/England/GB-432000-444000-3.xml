 MUCH OF THE LAND IS USED FOR FARMING. 
 THERE ARE SEVERAL MIXED FARMS- BUT    
 MANY OF THE SMALL FARMS HAVE BECOME   
 UNECONOMIC BECAUSE OF THE HIGH COST OF
 MACHINERY. FARM HOUSES HAVE BEEN SOLD 
 FOR DWELLING  HOUSES AND THE LAND     
 RENTED TO THE LARGER FARMERS FOR FOOD 
 CROPS, GRAZING AND SILAGE. THE LAND IN
 THE WHARFE VALLEY IS USED FOR GROWING 
 WHEAT, THE STEEP HILLSIDE FOR SHEEP   
 GRAZING AND THE HIGHEST LAND FOR      
 EITHER WHEAT OR GRAZING.              
 STOCKTON GRANGE AND MOORHILL FARMS.   
 THESE ARE THE TWO LARGEST FARMS, A    
 TOTAL ACREAGE OF 528 ACRES.  THEY ARE 
 FARMED BY ONE FARMER AND THREE FARM   
 WORKERS, AND ARE MIXED FARMS WITH 900 
 EWES, 350 SOWS AND WHEAT GROWN AS A   
 CROP.  THE FARMER OWNS 2 TRACTORS, A  
 COMBINE HARVESTER, 4 TRAILERS,
