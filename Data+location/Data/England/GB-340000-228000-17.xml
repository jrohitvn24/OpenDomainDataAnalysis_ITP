 Somebody is "on". The others run round
 the playground. The one who is "on"   
 tries to catch as many people as he   
 can. Those touched stand still with   
 their arms out. Then the other        
 children run up and try to free them  
 without being touched themselves.

 Two people, (or one strong person), is
 "on".They call somebody's name out. he
 tries to run the length of the        
 playground without being picked up by 
 the person who is "on". If the person 
 succeeds the rest of the players run  
 down the playground without being     
 picked up. If he does not succeed he  
 is on together with the others who    
 were "on" before.
