		<title>12Nether Stowey: Churches</title>
		<content> Within this area there are three      
 Anglican churches, under the Diocese  
 of Bath and Wells. The Church of St.  
 Paul and St. Peter in the village of  
 Over Stowey, and that of St. Mary's   
 Nether Stowey are both under the      
 ministry of Rev.R.Parker of Nether    
 Stowey. The churches are active and   
 hold functions and house groups. There
 is a choir, and children can attend   
 Crusader Classes at the Vicarage. The 
 Vicar takes a keen interest in the    
 welfare of the Primary School , and is
 Chairman of the Governors. Each Friday
 he conducts a service of worship in   
 school, and occasionally the whole    
 school attends a service in the       
 church. There is also an Anglican     
 church at Dodington, in Holford       
 parish, which is only used            
 intermittently.The Vicar is Rev.      
 Hancock.                              </content>
