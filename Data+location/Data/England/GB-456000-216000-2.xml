		<title>02A DAY IN MY LIFE (1)</title>
		<content>I wake up at about 6:45a.m. on         
weekdays.It's Thursday today,we do     
games.I get dressed and then I go      
downstairs.  I am awake before anyone  
else so I lay the table for breakfast  
and go and do my paino practice. I     
practice the piano for about 20        
minutes,then I go and have my          
breakfast.I have 2 helpings of         
cornflakes.While we are having our     
breakfast,our mum makes our            
sandwiches for us(George Helen         
Rachel and me.)We all go to the same   
school which is about 2 miles away at  
about 8:30a.m.   I ride to school.     
School starts at 9:00a.m.,but I get    
there at 8:40a.m. When I get to        
school,my friends and I play Tig.At    
9:00a.m. the school bell rings and we  
all go in.At 9:05a.m. the infants come 
into our class for radio assembly.At   
9:30a.m. we do maths.I don't like maths</content>
