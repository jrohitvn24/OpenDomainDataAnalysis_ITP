		<content>    Over 30 boys from our school are   
 involved in a play which is being     
 produced by the BBC.  The play is     
 about  3 boys that are fanatical about
 steam engines. Thet go out to spend a 
 day train spotting and it turns into a
 disaster, as they get caught by the   
 railway police and end up arguing     
 amongst themselves about the          
 leadership of their gang.             
    The children from our school were  
 auditioned in school, and then went to
 Keighley to do the shooting.  The boys
 all had to have special haircuts and  
 wear long baggy shorts, as the play is
 set in 1960.  The boys spent 2 days   
 shooting, during which time they had  
 to jump on and off trains, and were   
 showered with sprinklers for a rain   
 scene.  3 of the pupils hae obtained  
 major roles in the production.
