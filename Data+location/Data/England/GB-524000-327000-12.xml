		<content>      The building was originally of   
 wood, to keep chickens in, but rebuilt
 in brick by Mr. Charlie Rawding in    
 1948.                                 
      In the 1950's V.Goodman and      
 C.Robinson started selling tyres from 
 the premises.  Ten years later, the   
 Michelin Tyre Company purchased the   
 premises and still owns them today.   
      They are run by a subsidiary     
 company called Associated Tyre        
 Specialists, Ltd., who own some 450   
 similar depots throughout the U.K.    
 They also have interests in America   
 and Holland.                          
      1985 will see some dramatic      
 alterations to the building when the  
 front will be demolished and rebuilt. 
      Next door is Mr. Rawding's cafe  
 and lorry park.
