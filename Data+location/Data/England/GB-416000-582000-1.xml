		<content> The N.E. end provides an older housing
 development over looking a large, well
 patronised golf course. The peoples   
 common land lies alongside the golfing
 green which provides a pleasant green 
 rural aspect as one approaches the    
 town. The Morpeth A1 by pass cuts its 
 way alongside the common with         
 cultivated farm land on its west side.
 Searle Chemical Company factory, which
 is the largest employer in the Morpeth
 area is situated on the B6524 Road.   
 There is a morning and evening bus    
 provided for these workers. The rural 
 community of Tranwell is situated     
 nearby surrounded by well cultivated  
 farmland.                             
 To the South are a number of luxurious
 homes,housing business executives     
 commuting in to Newcastle, set amongst
 a pleasant cluster of woodland.
