		<title>10POTTEN END-THE POND II.</title>
		<content> THE PEOPLE HERE APPRECIATE THE LITTLE 
 BIT OF WILDLIFE THEY CAN SEE AND ENJOY
 THE DIFFERENT SOUNDS OF THE BIRDS AND 
 INSECTS.                              
                                       
 OPPOSITE THE PUBLIC HOUSE ON THE OTHER
 SIDE OF THE GREEN IS THE VILLAGE      
 CHURCH AND RECREATION HALL. THE CHURCH
 IS VERY PRETTY AND HAS SOME VERY      
 INTERESTING SHAPED TREES THAT SURROUND
 IT. WHEN PEOPLE COME OUT OF THE CHURCH
 THEY WALK ACROSS THE GREEN AND ROUND  
 THE POND TO THE PUBLIC HOUSE. THEIR   
 INTERESTS ARE OFTEN CAUGHT BY THE     
 VARIOUS INSECTS ,BIRDLIFE OR FISH ON  
 THE WAY AND THEY WILL STOP TO LOOK,AND
 LISTEN TO THE SOUNDS MADE BY THE      
 WILDLIFE AROUND THE POND.
