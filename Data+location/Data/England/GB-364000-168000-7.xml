		<title>07Interview with Flood Victim.</title>
		<content>   We went to interview Mrs Drower. She
 is 72 this year and she was a dinner  
 lady at our school. We wanted to ask  
 her about the floods in 1968 because  
 she was living in one of the houses   
 which was flooded. We thought that the
 floods were important because they    
 have made such a change to Keynsham.  
 She said the floods came up to the    
 ceiling of the downstairs room. Some  
 people were on the roofs of the houses
 to escape from the flood below them.  
 In the middle of the night she thought
 she heard someone at the door but it  
 was the water, which broke the door   
 down. Many things were washed away but
 she found her husband's jacket with   
 his wallet in the pocket. They had to 
 wash and scrub the pound notes and    
 hang them up to dry in the window.    
 (Mrs Drower lives at  Dapps Hill,     
 Keynsham by the River Chew.)          </content>
