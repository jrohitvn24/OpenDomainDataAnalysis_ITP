		<content> In the main this area is Church of    
 England.  Those who attend the church 
 services on Sunday or other festivals 
 do so at St. Cuthbert's Church in     
 Halsall village or St. Thomas's Church
 at Lydiate.                           
 Children attending junior school go   
 either to the village school in       
 Haskayne or to the church school of   
 Halsall.                              
 The few Catholic families in the area 
 attend St. Mary's Church in Lydiate,  
 this being the nearest to Haskayne.   
 Or those who live in the northern     
 section of this area, to St.          
 Elizabeth's church in Scarisbrick, or 
 St.Anne's in Ormskirk.  The catholic  
 children usually attend Our Lady's    
 R.C.school in Lydiate.  These are the 
 only religions mentioned in this area.
