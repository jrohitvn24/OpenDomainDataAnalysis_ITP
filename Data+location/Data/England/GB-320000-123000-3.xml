		<title>03TRADE -TAUNTON CATTLE MARKET</title>
		<content> Taunton has the largest cattle market 
 in the South West of England and is in
 the top ten cattle markets in Britain.
 Over 7000 head of stock is sold weekly
 and there is also a produce market and
 an open market.                       
  The market site covers 7 acres but is
 still not large enough and there are  
 plans to extend it.                   
  Farmers bring stock in from a 50 mile
 radius and buyers come from as far    
 afield as Scotland, Ireland and       
 France. Animals are sent to most      
 E.E.C. countries and many sheep are   
 sent for slaughter to the Middle East.
  Apart from animals farmers bring in  
 cream, chicken, eggs, cheese and      
 vegetables for sale in the Produce    
 Hall. Outside there are 60 stalls     
 selling a variety of goods from fresh 
 fish to clothing.
