		<title>14CONSERVATION AROUND BURWELL.</title>
		<content> The{Cambridge Conservation Corps}are  
 clearing{The Devil's Ditch}of         
 privet,hawthorn and brambles.It is a  
{historic monument}on chalkland some 7 
 miles long and 12-18 feet high.       
 Starting at Reach,it finishes         
 near Wood Ditton.Its history is less  
 sure.It could be{Roman or Saxon.}It is
 being cleared so the chalkland stays  
 open for special flora such as the    
{Pasque Flower}orchid that grows on    
 it.A group member said,"You may have  
 to conserve somethings at the expense 
 of others."                           
  The cost is 95p for every person     
 helping.This goes towards mending     
 tools and making sure they work.They  
 also charge 30p for each mile their   
 van,{'The Ambulance',}travels.All this
 money is paid by{CAMBIENT (Cambridge  
{and Isle of Ely Naturalists Trust)}who
 asked them to do it.                  </content>
