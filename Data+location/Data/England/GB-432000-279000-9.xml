		<title>09The Spon Street Scheme</title>
		<content> This is in the area known as Spon     
 End .In 1966 the council decided to   
 preserve some of Coventry's oldest    
 buildings by relocating them all in   
 one place. Many of them are Medieval  
 and Tudor houses brought from all     
 corners of Coventry. Originally Spon  
 St. was the centre of the watch-making
 industry in Coventry. Even earlier it 
 was know for weaving cloth, and that  
 is why many of the buildings (top     
 shops) have large upper windows. The  
 upper floors were used as work rooms  
 and needed a lot of light. One road   
 leading off Spon St. is called Watch  
 Close. Not all of Spon St. is used for
  preserving houses because it is cut  
 in half by the Coventry ring road.    
 Most of the preserved houses are used 
 as shops.
