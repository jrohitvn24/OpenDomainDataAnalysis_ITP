		<content> Since the Middle Ages, Stamford has   
 had many markets, but now, in 1986,   
 we only have two main ones-a cattle   
 market (Monday) and a general market  
 (Friday). The general market is held  
 in Broad St. and Ironmonger St., and  
 there are between 80 and 90 stalls.   
 About 33% of it is clothing, whilst   
 fruit and vegetables take up about    
 10%. Other stalls consist of fish,    
 meat, hardware, dress / curtain       
 materials, plants, bed linen/towels,  
 toys, cards, knitting wool, jewellery,
 footwear, leather goods, charity      
 stalls (eg Red Cross), cakes, cane    
 crafts, general food, confectionery,  
 petfoods, dairy produce and cosmetic  
 Most stall holders visit other markets
 in East Anglia and the Midlands. Most 
 of the interviewed stall holders rated
 the market a good one. Among          
 suggestions were: more and cleaner    </content>
