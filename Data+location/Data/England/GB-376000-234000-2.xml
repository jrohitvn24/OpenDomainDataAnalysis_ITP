		<title>02SOCIAL EVENTS AROUND BERROW</title>
		<content> This area having a small scattered    
 population, social{events}and{clubs   
 include people from neighbouring      
 parishes. There is a Welcome Club for 
 senior citizens, and a branch of the  
 Women's Institute, both of which meet 
 one afternoon a month, and an Old Time
 Dancing Club. Sources of{entertainment
 include a monthly whist drive, Harvest
 Supper, occasional Bingo and social   
 evenings,all of which use the Church  
 Hall. There are also church fetes.    
 Other opportunities to meet are coffee
 evenings and mornings at private homes
 to raise money for various causes.    
{Recreational}facilities are few- keep 
 fit classes sometimes- and people have
 to go to nearby towns for sport or    
 theatre etc. Many people garden, some 
 walk on the Malvern Hills. Some child-
 ren ride ponies and the Ledbury Hunt  
 covers this area.                     </content>
