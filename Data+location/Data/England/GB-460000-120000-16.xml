 There are two general stores one of   
 which has a Sub Post Office           
 included.In common with other such    
 establishments they are always in     
 danger of closing down due to lack of 
 support. The Corhampton Store         
 benefits greatly from passing trade as
 it is situated beside the A32 road.   
 A Fishmonger/greengrocer trades from  
 his van twice a week.                 
 Unigate Dairies deliver some meat and 
 groceries as well as milk each day,   
 except Sunday.A frozen foods firm also
 delivers orders.
