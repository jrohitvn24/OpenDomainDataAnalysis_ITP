		<title>10DENNIS MORTIMER, FOOTBALLER.</title>
		<content>  I have lived in Wall for five years  
with my wife Janis, and two children,  
Richard and Jonathan.                  
 We live in a cottage which was once   
a barn, one part believed to be 200    
years old, the other 100.              
  I am a professional footballer, 10   
years with Aston Villa Football Club.  
Now I play for Brighton Football Club, 
this means I divide my time between the
two places. I find Wall an excellent   
place to escape the crowds and noise   
of a football match.                   
  Being a small community we find the  
folk very friendly. With both mine and 
my wife's parents living far afield we 
find villagers willing to help ferrying
children to school in Lichfield and    
for babysitting duties.                
  Wall does not have any shops so it is
essential to have your own means of    
transport.                             </content>
