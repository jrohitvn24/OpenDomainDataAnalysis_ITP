		<title>02THE RIVER WYE</title>
		<content>  High Wycombe was built on the{River  
{Wye}to which it owes it's name.{Combe 
 meant{valley}in old English, so       
 WY-COMBE means "the valley of the     
 River Wye". The river,which is nine   
 miles long, flows from West Wycombe,  
 through the town and into the River   
 Thames at Bourne End. Formerly, it    
 provided power for the{40 water mills 
 along its banks for grinding corn,    
 fulling wool, and making paper. It was
 also known for its trout.             
  In 1970,the river was diverted       
 underground for half a mile in the    
 town centre in order to build a relief
 road and the Octogon shopping centre. 
 It emerges at the southern end of St  
 Mary's Street. There are now few fish 
 in the Wye,and it no longer provides  
 power for industry,but it attracts    
 picnickers and anglers to its banks.
