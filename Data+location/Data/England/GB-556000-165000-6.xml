		<content>The first place to visit is the Village
public house The Rising Sun by the     
green and War Memorial.The building    
dating from l656 is beamed and quaint  
and full of interest connected with the
Brands Hatch Racing Circuit.The "pub"  
was originally an Ale House adjoining a
nunnery which seems to be a strange    
partnership!Parts of the building      
unused are said to be the remains of   
the nunnery and a pathway parallel to  
the village road to be walked by the   
ghost of a nun.In the attics of Pennis 
Farm is an old skull with the story of 
ill luck to anyone who removes it.A    
local legend of galloping horsemen, a  
phantom coach and a womsn's screams is 
connected to the murder of a nun at    
Pennis said to be a nunnery before the 
Restoration.
