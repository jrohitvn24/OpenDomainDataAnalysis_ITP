		<content>  With the decline of industry in the  
 area the population has become static.
 There appears to be no immediate      
 likelihood of growth in housing or    
 trade.With the enormous expansion of  
 the steel works in the first half of  
 this century the population was       
 heavily weighted with young families  
 with young children.There has been a  
 significant decline in the birth rate 
 in the last ten years.There is now an 
 increasing number of elderly people in
 the community with a consequent need  
 for services.The farming population   
 has remained static although some     
 farms have been amalgamated into      
 larger units.A survey done by the     
 children showed that most families in 
 Barrow Hill have only one or two      
 children.
