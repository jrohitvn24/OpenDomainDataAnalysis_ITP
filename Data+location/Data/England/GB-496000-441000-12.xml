		<title>12A DAY IN MY LIFE-ETTON 1</title>
		<content> My name is Rachel and I am 11 yrs old.
 I live at Etton with my mum,dad,      
 brother Duncan and two pet cats,Felix 
 and Smudge.Here is an account of      
 Saturday,13th.July,85.                
 I woke up at 7.20a.m. and lay until   
 8.00.I made my bed and went downstairs
 to feed the cats.Then I made a cup of 
 tea and took it upstairs to my lazy   
 parents.We read ghost stories while my
 brother played on the computer.At     
 8.30 I dressed into my jodhpurs and   
 went to make eggy bread (bread dipped 
 in egg then fried) for my brother.It's
 gorgeous! I had my own breakfast,     
 cereals and a raw carrot.Afterwards I 
 washed and cleaned my teeth.Mum and I 
 changed the sheets on the beds and    
 then gathered the library books to    
 return later.We then set off for      
 Sainsbury's,a large food and homeware 
 store in Hessle.(CONT.p.13)           </content>
