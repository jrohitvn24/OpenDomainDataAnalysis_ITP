		<title>08Fear in Wolverhampton</title>
		<content>The rate of violence in Wolverhampton  
has increased a great deal over the    
last few years,partly because of       
unemployment.                          
People who are on their own are        
beginning to be frightened to go out of
the house because of the mobs of       
unemployed youths who hang around the  
streets looking for trouble.           
A few weeks ago,three masked men armed 
with baseball bats charged into a fish 
and chip shop.The owners wife tried    
hard to protect the till,but was thrown
to the ground after being beaten with  
the baseball bats.The men got away with
all that days takings.
