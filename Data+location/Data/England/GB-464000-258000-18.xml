		<title>18MY DAILY ROUTINE</title>
		<content>In the mornings, in our house, it is my
dad who gets up first on the weekdays, 
it is normally some time between 4 a.m.
and 5 a.m.. Then my brother has to get 
up to go to work as well. After my     
brother has gone my mother gets up and 
she gets me up for school. I don't     
bother to get dressed until I have had 
my Rice Krispies and a drink. I then go
back upstairs and get dressed. At about
8.30 a.m. I go round to my friend      
Lorraine's and call for her and we     
sometimes go down to the shops. Then we
go on to school.                       
After school I go home and get changed.
Sometimes I go and call for Lorraine   
and/or Samantha and then we go down to 
the Green. We either play on the Green 
or watch the boys playing football,    
sometimes Lorraine joins in with them.
