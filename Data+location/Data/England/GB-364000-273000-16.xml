		<content> On Sunday, 12th May, the Pentabus     
 Theatre Company organised an          
 afternoon's entertainment at Lacon    
 Childe School called "Cleobury Wakes".
 Performers came from Pentabus, local  
 schools and the area extending from   
 Clee Hill to Stottesdon. It began with
 dancing round a May bough in the      
 playground. Everyone then went in the 
 hall, where the past was revived in   
 scenes showing local customs and      
 characters. There was Morris dancing, 
 Victorian School day, playground games
 and miming of cock-fighting and a day 
 in the quarries. Children from our    
 Primary School performed maypole      
 dances. All round the hall were craft 
 stalls with corn dollies, herbs, lace 
 making, candle making, home baked     
 biscuits and bread, dairy produce and 
 such things. The Bray Construction    
 Band played music to listen to.       </content>
