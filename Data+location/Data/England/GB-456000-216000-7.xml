		<content>Arthur Goddard lives in a village      
called Fencott.He lives in a very old  
house and he has no electricily or     
gas.At night he lights a Victorian oil 
lamp and he cooks all his food on an   
old  Victorian kitchen range.His house 
is very untidy from the outside and    
very interesting inside.When we went to
visit him he told us some stories of   
when he was little and when he went to 
our school. One of the stories was     
that he walked to school every day and 
it was about three quarters of a mile. 
On very rainy days a horse and cart    
with a sort of sheet cover used to     
pick he and his sister up.Another      
story was that on Friday afternoon     
some of the boys out of his class that 
were eleven or over walked up to the   
Railway Halt on Mansmoor Lane and      
caught the train to Oxford.They had a  
woodwork lesson there.                 </content>
