		<content> Northborough has a cross-section of   
 housing types. The area is very       
 historical and parts of Church Street 
 date back to Cromwellian times. Hence,
 many of the cottages along Church     
 Street are 4-500 years old, stone     
 built, thatched with small windows.   
 Only a few of the children attending  
 Northborough School live in these     
 houses.                               
 Many of the children live in an estate
 built in the early 1960's centred     
 around Granville Avenue.These houses  
 are in the middle price range,        
 (Â£35-40,000). On the edges of         
 Northborough,there are the bigger     
 detached houses, (Â£50-100,000).       
 Maxey is a similer villge to          
 Northborough in the types of houses,  
 ranging from old cottages to brand new
 housing.
