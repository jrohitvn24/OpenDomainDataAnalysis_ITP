		<content> The North York Moors Nat.Park is      
 famous for its magnificant scenery.   
 Many walkers frequent the area and    
 some of the paths used date back      
 to pre-historic times.The Drove road  
 was used by men from Scotland as they 
 drove their cattle to markets in the  
 south.They would climb the Cleveland  
 hills at Scarth NickG.R.474004 where  
 there is a natural gap in the hills.  
 Keeping to the high dry land,they     
 would travel along the hills to       
 Sutton Bank.The Drove road is still   
 used today by farmers to move their   
 sheep from one area of moorland to    
 another.Two well-known footpaths pass 
 through the area,the Cleveland Way and
 the Lyke Wake Walk.Other visitors come
