		<title>07Transport through Cliffe</title>
		<content>      There used to be three{railways} 
 through the area of Cliffe. On the    
 common was the junction between the   
 Selby to Market Weighton Railway and  
 the Derwent Valley Light Railway, but 
 both of these have closed.            
      Trains from Hull to Selby, Leeds 
 and York go through Cliffe, but none  
 stop at the station in Cliffe, which  
 was called Hemingbrough Station,      
 because when the line was built in    
 1840 Cliffe was in that parish.       
      The Selby to Hemingbrough{bus}   
{service}goes through Cliffe and       
 Osgodby, 12 buses in each direction   
 each day. The fare from Cliffe to     
 Selby is 65p, and three people can    
 travel by taxi for less than the bus  
 fare. Anybody who works further       
 away than Selby has to have their own 
 transport. South Duffield has no      
 public transport.                     </content>
