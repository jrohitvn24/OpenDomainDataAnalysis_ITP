		<content>       King's Sutton Manor is the      
 biggest house in the village.The      
 people live there in great style.     
 The nanny showed us round.            
       The Manor has a priest hole in  
 which priests hid during the Civil    
 War.  It is thought Charles I used the
 Manor.   There are gargoyles on the   
 drainpipes, which are ugly faces to   
 ward off evil spirits.                
      The nanny told us about a young  
 boy who fell out of his window and    
 died.   His parents blocked off his   
 window on the inside and the owner of 
 the house has slept in that room and  
 said he felt his bed being lifted up. 
 It may have been the vibrations from  
 the trains!   Nowadays the old hound  
 gates on the beautiful staircase,     
 which stopped the dogs going upstairs,
 are used to stop the baby falling     
 down.                                 </content>
