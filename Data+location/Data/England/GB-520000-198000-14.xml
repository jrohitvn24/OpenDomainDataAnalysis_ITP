		<content> One of the chief amenities in the area
 and also one of the main employers is 
 the Crest hotel which is situated     
 just                                  
 off the A.1. at South Mimms. It was   
 once owned by Esso but is now a member
 of the Bass Charrington group of      
 hotels. It is a 3 star A.A. &amp; R.A.C.  
 rated hotel and has over 200 beds and 
 about a hundred staff to look after   
 the guests. Most of the hotel's       
 business is done between Monday &amp;     
 Thursday when 90% of the rooms are    
 occupied.At the weekend only 45% of   
 the rooms are full. Most of the       
 hotel's clients are businessmen       
 travelling to or from London. Some of 
 the hotel's employees are local people
 but others have moved here and live in
 the hotel.
