		<content> DAIRY FARMING                         
 We visited 2 dairy farms in our area, 
 they were each between 100 and 200    
 acres. This size of farm can support a
 herd of between 100 and 200 cows. The 
 herds are generally Friesans but there
 were some Jersey cows. The farms were 
 owned by the farmers as is generally  
 the case rather than renting. The     
 farmers have also built up their farms
 by buying land, new buildings and     
 increasing the size of their herds.   
 Some of the land is used to grow grass
 which is cut to make into silage. The 
 grass is cut and piled up into a mound
 and then covered to protect it from   
 the weather. The grass is then        
 preserved by a controlled process of  
 fermentation; the sugars are converted
 to acids which then act as a          
 preservative. The silage is then fed  
 to the cattle during the winter.      </content>
