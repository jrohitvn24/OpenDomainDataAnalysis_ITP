		<content>{A TYPICAL WEEKEND                     
   During termtime there is always some
{homework}to do at weekends. Although I
 try to do as much as I can during the 
 week, there is always some left over  
 for Saturday. So on a Saturday morning
 I finish my homework and as I am lucky
 enough to have my own{pony}I generally
 go for a ride in the afternoon. We    
 have quite a few bridleways around my 
 area, but many of them are difficult  
 to ride through.                      
   My weekends are mostly taken up with
 my pony and sometimes on a Sunday I   
 hack to a local show. Although riding 
 is the fun part of owning a pony,     
 there are also many hours of hard work
 involved in jobs such as cleaning tack
 and mucking out the stable.           
   Sometimes on a Saturday evening I go
 into Worcester to meet my friends and 
 go to the Rollo Disco.   Sallyann Owen</content>
