		<content>  We interviewed a member of staff at  
 Leamland Coach Travel and we have     
 compiled our findings to describe     
 their publicity and information       
 systems.                              
  There are three shops, a garage, a   
 headquarters in Hassocks and a        
 transport depot. They publicise by    
 putting leaflets through people's     
 doors and by advertising in local     
 magazines and newspapers. The Hassocks
 office controls 16 coaches. Their     
 office equipment consists of          
 photocopiers, computers and a large   
 telephone system. The computers are an
 Apricot, a Cado and an Apple. They    
 have the Cado computer at Sayers      
 Common. They employ 35 staff. The     
 office has been in Hassocks for about 
 3 years.
