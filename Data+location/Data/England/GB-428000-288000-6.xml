		<title>06INTERVIEW WITH REV. PHILLIPS</title>
		<content>  Rev.Peter Phillips &amp; his wife Betty  
 are a couple in their 50's.They were  
 born in Weston Super Mare,but have    
 lived in various parts of the country.
 Mr Phillips still speaks with a slight
 Somerset accent.They have been in this
 area for 14 months,and hope to stay   
 until retirement.They find the        
 community a very close one,in which   
 the extended family is very important.
  The changes in trade in the area is  
 drawing New and Old Arley together,and
 Mr Phillips is pleased about this.Many
 people work at the industrial estate, 
 which is on the site of the old pit,  
 and less distinction is being made    
 between New and Old Arley.Unemployment
 is less of a problem than in large    
 centres,as many people are in farming 
 and work on the industrial estate,    
 although Dawmill tends to take more   
 people from local villages.           </content>
