		<content> The land is used for growing          
 wheat,barley,potatoes,peas,sugarbeet  
 and oil seed rape.Some of the land is 
 used for grass land.In the summer the 
 grass is cut for hay.Most of the farm 
 buildings are old but most barns are  
 new.The farm machinery includes       
 tractors,trailers,combines,ploughs,   
 bailers,grass cutters,potato planters 
 and seeders.                          
   On crop farms the farmer needs more 
 machinery than on animal farms.Some   
 farmers have hilly farms,but some have
 flat land.The name of my farm is Town 
 End Farm.It is very old.              
   On the  animal farms are            
 cows,hens,pigs,sheep,horses,goats and 
 bulls.There are a lot of land farmers 
 but not so many animal farms.
