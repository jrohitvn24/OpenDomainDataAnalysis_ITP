		<title>10FAMILY PETS IN DARLINGTON</title>
		<content> We have completed a survey on domestic
 pets,and have discovered that pets are
 very popular to keep.                 
 Children between the ages of ten and  
 eleven keep the most pets.Rabbits and 
 rodents are owned by 50% of this age  
 group,fish are next with 27%.         
 For the seven to eight age group,fish 
 are also favourites for pets,and so   
 are dogs.                             
 29.8% of the school own dogs.Dogs are 
 intelligent, good tempered and loving,
 so when given a choice of pets,3 in 10
 persons choose a dog.However,dogs need
 a lot of attention and exercise which 
 is probably why one in five persons   
 own fish.These pets brighten up a dull
 room with their attractive colours,   
 and are easy to care for.
