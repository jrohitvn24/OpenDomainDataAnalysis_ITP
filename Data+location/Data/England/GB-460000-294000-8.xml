		<title>08Communications around Kilby</title>
		<content> Since the area is mainly Rural with a 
 very small population the methods of  
 communication are also very           
 limited.There are only two Post Boxes 
 in the grid,one in Kilby itself and   
 another outside the grounds of Wistow 
 Hall.Kilby also has a Sub-Post Office 
 and a Public Telephone.The rest of the
 grid contains so little Urban or      
 dwelling areas that there are no other
 means of communication than the       
 private telephone system.Although     
 trains pass through the grid none stop
 so all mail is brought in from        
 Leicester.Since the area is so close  
 to the Urban areas of Wigston and     
 Leicester oll means of communication  
 are within easy reach.
