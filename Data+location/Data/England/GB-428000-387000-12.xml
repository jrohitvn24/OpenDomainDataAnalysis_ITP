		<content>  From the survey we carried out within
 the school we found out that Sheffield
 Wednesday was the most popular Soccer 
 team for Youngsters to support.A few  
 people chose Tottenham Hotspur,and a  
 few chose Chesterfield.All the people 
 who go to soccer matches only go to   
 home games.Everybody agreed that the  
 soccer violence shown on TV at the    
 match between Juventus &amp; Liverpool was
 disgusting.They also agree that the   
 ban on English Clubs is unfair.They   
 think that to stop soccer violence    
 they will either have to ban crowds or
 use close circuit TV cameras.We think 
 that soccer violence will get worse in
 years to come unless somebody takes   
 very serious action soon.The minority 
 of the crowds are giving English      
 Soccer a very bad reputation.
