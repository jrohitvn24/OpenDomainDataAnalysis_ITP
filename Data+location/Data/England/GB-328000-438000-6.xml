		<content>{THE CASTLE CASINO NIGHT CLUB}         
 The Castle Casino is situated on North
 Shore Promenade. It contains a room   
 with tables for private card games,   
 slot machines , a restaurant and two  
 bars.                                 
 It was built around 1920 in the       
 architectural style of a French       
 chateau, for a wealthy eccentric, who 
 intended it for his girlfriend who was
 in show business. However she never   
 lived there.                          
 In 1965 the wrestler Jack Pye bought  
 it and turned it into a night-club.   
 Now it is owned by Monsieur Brivet and
 is part of a French Consortium which  
 owns casinos in Blackpool,            
 Manchester, Lyons and California.     
 Local people, as well as              
 holidaymakers, enjoy the chance to win
 some money and have a good night out.
