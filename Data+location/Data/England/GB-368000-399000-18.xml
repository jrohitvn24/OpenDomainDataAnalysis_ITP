		<content>{THE EAST LANCASHIRE ROAD}(A580) KNOWN 
 AS THE{'EAST LANCS'}OR THE{'NEW ROAD' 
 IS A{DUAL CARRIAGEWAY}LINKING         
{LIVERPOOL}AND{MANCHESTER.}IT IS A VERY
 BUSY ROAD CARRYING HEAVY TRANSPORT,   
 SUCH AS{ARTICULATED LORRIES,}OFTEN TOO
 LARGE FOR NORMAL ROADS. THERE ARE FEW 
 HOUSES FACING THE EAST LANCS AS THE   
 ROAD WOULD PROVE TO BE A{HAZARD}TO    
 YOUNG CHILDREN AND IT IS A RATHER     
{NOISY}PLACE TO LIVE. IT IS PROBABLY   
 TIME THAT AN EXTRA LANE WAS BUILT TO  
 HELP THE SMOOTH FLOW OF SUCH A VOLUME 
 OF TRAFFIC.                           
 IN PLACES ON THE NORTH AND SOUTH SIDES
 OF THE CARRIAGEWAY THERE ARE GRASS    
 VERGES, HEDGES AND{CYCLING PATHS}OR   
{FOOTPATHS.}NEW IMPROVED CYCLE PATHS   
 ARE BEING CONSTUCTED WEST OF OUR AREA.
 THERE IS A{NEW SEATING AREA}AT THE    
 JUNCTION OF THIS ROAD AND{HIGHER GREEN
{LANE.   }                             </content>
