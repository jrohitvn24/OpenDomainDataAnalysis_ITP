		<title>13COMMUNICATION IN AYLESBURY</title>
		<content>  We went to the {sorting office} for  
this category. Aylesbury was once a    
good place to have a sorting office    
because a main railway line went right 
through but now it isn't so efficient. 
400 {postmen}, 12 sorting ladies and 26
postmen (high grade) are employed in   
the sorting office. Aylesbury's sorting
office covers 350 sq. miles. The first 
2 letters of Aylesbury's postcode are  
H.P.                                   
 We also visited the {telephone        
exchange}. In the exchange there are   
35 part time operators in the day and  
20 at night. Each operator takes an    
average of 50 calls an hour. Although  
the operators receive 5 real emergency 
calls a day, they have hundreds of     
hoax emergency calls.
