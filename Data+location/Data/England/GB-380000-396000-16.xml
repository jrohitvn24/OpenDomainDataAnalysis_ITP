		<title>16ORDSALL HALL</title>
		<content> This is perhaps the most important    
 timber framed building in Greater     
 Manchester.  It was built as a manor  
 house in early Tudor times by the     
 Radclyffe family. A brick built wing  
 was added in 1639. It has been        
 carefully restored in recent years and
 now houses a permanent exibition of   
 social life in earlier times. The most
 notable feature is the Great Hall with
 a sixteenth century spere truss.
