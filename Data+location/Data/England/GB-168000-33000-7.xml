		<content> As a growing number of the community  
 is elderly, they rely heavily on      
 public transport, especially as the   
 nearest shops of any size are in      
 Camborne which is 6Km away. To meet   
 this need there are regular bus       
 services to Camborne, Redruth, Helston
  Falmouth and Truro. Much of the      
 remote farming community, however must
 rely on their own means of transport. 
 Horses are still widely used, both for
 transport as well as for leisure      
 activities.
