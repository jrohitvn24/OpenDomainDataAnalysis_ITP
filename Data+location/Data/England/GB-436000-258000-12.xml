		<title>12BICYCLES,MOTORBIKES, MOPEDS</title>
		<content> Out of a survey of l38 households we  
 found an incredible number of 246     
 bicycles.  Most families had 4        
 bicycles.  Half were ladies bicycles  
 and half of them were used mainly to  
 shop in the village.  Only 9 people   
 went to work on their bicycle.        
 Majority were used for pleasure       
 riding.  In the same survey l9        
 households had motor bikes, none with 
 a sidecar and 7 had mopeds.  Less than
 half were used to go to work.  Had we 
 surveyed households with children at  
 Secondary School we would expect to   
 find a much larger proportion of      
 machines.
