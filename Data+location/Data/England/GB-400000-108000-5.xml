		<title>05KNOWLTON - HENGE MONUMENT</title>
		<content> Knowlton Church &amp; Knowlton Rings are  
 owned by Lord Shaftesbury whose       
 ancestors bought them from the Sturt  
 family in l79l. Knowlton is a         
{pre-historic site}with ramparts of a  
 Neolithic henge encircling the walls  
 of a deserted Norman Church remodelled
 in the l4th Century. Today the grassy 
 ramparts are a{popular picnic site &amp;}a
{tourist attraction.}In Spring the     
 slopes are covered with yellow        
 cowslips &amp; now the Department of the  
 Environment who tend the site very    
 wisely refrain from cutting the grass 
 until after the flowers have seeded.  
 Other{chalk-soil flora}also abound    
 including orchids, bellflowers &amp;      
 quaking grass. All the surrounding    
{land is farmed by the Shaftesbury}    
{Estate}which has a herd of Friesian   
 cows as well as growing cereals.
