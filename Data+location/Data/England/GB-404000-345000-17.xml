		<title>17 GAMES London,Pig in Middle.</title>
		<content>  LONDON.To play London you need at    
least three or more children.One child 
stands with their backs towards the    
other children and spells"London" out  
loud while the rest of the children    
walk across the playground towards the 
speller.When London has been spelt the 
speller turns round to see if anyone is
moving.If the speller sees anybody move
that person has to go back again to the
start.The winner is the child who gets 
across the playground without being    
seen by the speller.                   
  PIG IN THE MIDDLE.For this game you  
need three children and a ball.Two of  
the players throw the ball to each     
other over the head of the third       
player.If the one in the middle can    
catch the ball then this player changes
places with the player who threw the   
ball and the game starts again.
