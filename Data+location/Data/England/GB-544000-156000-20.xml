		<title>20Summary of Life in Knockholt</title>
		<content> The village has its Senior Citizens'  
 and Lunch Club and transport is       
 provided for those who have none, to  
 foot clinics etc. A daily prescription
 rota is manned, with deliveries to    
 patients. There is one Neighbourhood  
 Watch group and others are proposed.  
 Many house to house collections,      
 fetes, bazaars and coffee mornings are
 held for various charities and much   
 local interest is taken in such       
 questions as stubble burning. There is
 no local police station in Knockholt  
 now and this is much regetted. Access 
 to health services is difficult,      
 particularly for those without their  
 own transport. We find Knockholt a    
 friendly and helpful village in which 
 to live with many activities for all  
 ages. Delving into our village history
 and enviroment has been a rewarding   
 task. {Knockholt Womens Institute.    </content>
