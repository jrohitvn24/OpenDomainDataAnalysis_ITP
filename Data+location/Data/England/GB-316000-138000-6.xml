		<title>06Nether Stowey:People at Work</title>
		<content> As this is an agricultural area a     
 number of people work on the land or  
 with animals. Stowey Court Farm,      
 making cheese and farm produce, offers
 employment. Nearby, the Poultry       
 Packers is probably the biggest       
 employer within our area,particularly 
 for shift work.More work can be found 
 in building, shops, pubs, some        
 domestic employment, the Health       
 Centre, Library, and School. A few    
 people are involved in cottage        
 industries. A large section of the    
 community commute to Taunton,         
 Bridgwater, Bristol, and countrywide. 
 A few people work on contracts        
 abroad.As is common nationwide at this
 time, there is a shortage of          
 employment, which particularly affects
 young people.
