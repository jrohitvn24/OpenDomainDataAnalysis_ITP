		<title>14Religious observance</title>
		<content> The parish church (Church of England) 
 is the most well attended closely     
 followed by the Catholic church.      
{Morning services}are the most popular 
 and many couples still choose to get  
{married}in church.{Burials}are less   
 frequent than{cremation.}Both churches
 offer outings, study classes, Sunday  
 schools and holiday activities for    
 children. Church attendance and       
 religious observance have{declined}in 
 recent years. Schools are holding     
 fewer{religious assemblies}and more   
 events are held on a Sunday and more  
 shops are open. However there are     
 signs of change. Small{fundamentalist 
 groups attract members and the{Quaker 
 group is swelled through links with   
 the{Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. 
 Church-affiliated groups like the     
{Mothers' Union}are more politically   
 active (eg in opposing abortion).     </content>
