 usually taught by one teacher for the 
 year.They study maths, english and a  
 variety of topics.At eleven they      
 attend one of the two Comprehensive   
 Schools. They are put into classes    
 according to their ability and also   
 study more specialist subjects, when  
 at sixteen they take either O levels  
 or CSE exams depending on their       
 ability.Each subject is generally     
 taught by a different teacher.If they 
 do well there is an opportunity to do 
 two years study for A levels.
