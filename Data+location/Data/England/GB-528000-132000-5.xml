		<content> On 27th June 1985 some children went  
 birdwatching with a man from the{Royal
{Society for the Protection of Birds.  
 The footpath we went down was off the 
{Balcombe Road}opposite a private road 
 called{Whitley Hill.}The footpath is  
 fenced off from the private woodland. 
 It was very quiet and peaceful and    
 every time we saw or heard a bird the 
 man from the{R.S.P.B.}told us a bit   
 about it.We saw:{Nuthatch, Chaffinch, 
{Bluetit, yellow-hammer,Willow-warbler,
{Swift,Robin, Hobby, Wood-pigeon, wren.
 Then we looked at things like fungi,  
 insects and plants.This is what we    
 saw:{Grasshoppers, Tiger beetles,     
{crickets,Gold beetle,Froghopper.}We   
 saw{Yellow bracket fungi}on a{yew tree
 and a{pollarded beech tree.}The       
 pollarded trees are very old. The wood
 was once used for{charcoal burning}for
 the{iron ore industry                 </content>
