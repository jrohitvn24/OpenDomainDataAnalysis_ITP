		<title>14LIVING IN FELLING,GATESHEAD</title>
		<content>   Felling is situated on a slope down 
 to the River Tyne. Near the bottom,   
 beside the Metro station there are    
 many small mining houses crowded      
 together.                             
   The shops in Felling are practically
 the same.e.g.there are 7 banks and    
 building societies altogether. Laws   
 and the Co-op are the biggest food    
 stores and Woolworths sells everything
 from records and kettles to D.I.Y. and
 clothes.                              
                                       
 To be in Felling, its really a treat  
 There's lots of people to know and    
 meet                                  
 To be in Felling, its really neat     
 You give 10 out of 10 as you walk down
 the street                            
 To live in Feling is sometimes dull   
 But at least its not London where its 
 always full.                          </content>
