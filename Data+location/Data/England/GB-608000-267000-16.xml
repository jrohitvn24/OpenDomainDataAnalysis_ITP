     We interviewed a man who has lived
Stoke Ash for 64 years. This is what he
told us about life 40+ years ago:      
     FARMING-in the second world war   
they had horses the breed was Suffolk  
punch .They were used for farming.     
     THE SECOND WORLD WAR-he can       
remember the day when about 300 Ameican
aircraft flew over together. We learnt 
about rationing and shortages of food. 
     HOMES-There was no electricity in 
Stoke Ash until 1957. They used to have
to get the water from one of two pumps 
in the village. You can see one of     
these pumps next to the phone-box.     
     A WHIRLWIND-He remembers a        
whirlwind that uprooted trees and      
smashed windows in a summerhouse.      
     LIFE TODAY-He says that life is   
better today because he enjoys watching
television.                            </content>
