		<content> THE RETREAT                           
 The Retreat is a private mental       
 hospital founded in the 18th Century  
 by William Tuke.William Tuke a Quaker 
 learned what had happened to a friend 
 in the York Asylum .He decided that   
 they needed a hospital for those who  
 were mentally ill and who could be    
 well looked after and well treated.At 
 that time doctors understood very     
 little about mental illness.William   
 Tuke with other Quakers in York       
 founded a new hospital for mentally   
 ill patients called The Retreat where 
 patients were treated with love and   
 kindness.The new hospital was         
 revolutionary and people came from all
 over Europe to observe the work that  
 was carried out there.The hospital has
 now expanded and has 130 patients who 
 pay up to Â£72 a day for treatment     
 there.                                </content>
