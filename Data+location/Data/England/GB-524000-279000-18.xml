		<title>18Transport in Rural Areas</title>
		<content> This predominantely rural area        
 contains l.5 kilometres of            
 unclassified and ll kilometres of Non 
 Principal classified road, allocated  
 an annual maintenance budget of Â£760  
 and Â£l240  per kilometre respectively.
 The traffic carried is mainly light   
 commuter traffic with some heavier    
 farm machinery and an increasing      
 number of vehicles used by American   
 Air Force personnel travelling between
 RAF Upwood and USAF Alconbury. For the
 greater length of this road the width 
 is effectively single lane, being     
 approximately 4.5 metres wide.  Public
 transport within the area is poor,    
 with a limited  bus service picking up
 at the villages of Great and Little   
 Raveley and Wistow. Private coaches   
 ferry the children to nearby schools. 
 There is no railway network, the      
 nearest station being at Huntingdon.  </content>
