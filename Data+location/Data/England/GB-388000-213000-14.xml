		<title>14PUBS IN BROCKWORTH</title>
		<content>The {landlord's day} starts at 07.45   
when he gets up to let in the          
cleaners.Then he gets breakfast ready  
for the guests (the inn is             
popular,standing at the A46 and A417   
junction).The next tasks are           
book-keeping,banking,checking the bar  
and wine cellar. The chef then         
arrives;the menu and food are          
selected-by now the time has reached   
midday.The bars are open now and the   
landlord does a spell of duty. The pub 
closes at 14.45. The pub reopens at    
17.45 and early evening is a busy      
period.The landlord visits the         
bars,kitchen and restaurant helping    
out.When the public house closes just  
after 23.00,the landlord checks the    
money and makes certain that           
everything is tidy.Only then is his    
day usually finished.
