		<title>08PONY TREKKING IN LYDFORD</title>
		<content>   Lydford Stables owns eleven horses  
 and ponies.They have three horses on  
 loan so Claire has fourteen horses.   
 Claire feeds her horses on hay fed in 
 haynets  and for hard food the horses 
 will have bran,sugar beet, oats and   
 pony nuts.They have this in a bucket  
 three times aday.The horses have new  
 shoes every two months.For a set of   
 four it costs twelve pounds.          
   The horses vary in sizes. The       
 smallest is 12h.h and Major is 16.3   
 h.h which is very large.              
   The horses and ponies go out for    
 about 3 hours on average every day.   
 Claire,in the summer, can have about  
 a hundred riders in a week.           
   Most of the tack is bought in an    
 out of town shopping centre.It is     
 cheaper there so she can save money.  
 At the end of the summer Claire will  
 sell some of her horses and poniesw.  </content>
