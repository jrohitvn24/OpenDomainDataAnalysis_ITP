 Things we do                          
 I like number and the computer. I     
 like number because I am very good at 
 it.I like playing on the computer     
 because I like playing games on it    
 too.   we write on it and play turtle.
 I like cooking and sewing.  I like    
 cooking because we can eat the cakes  
 afterwards.
