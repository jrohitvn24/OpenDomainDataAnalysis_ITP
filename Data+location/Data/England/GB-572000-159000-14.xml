		<title>14BLUEBELL HILL MYSTERY</title>
		<content> Bluebell Hill today is a dual         
 carriageway,but the tale we wish to   
 tell is of an accident on the orginal 
 Bluebell Hill.In 1965 a young lady,   
 who was about to be married was       
 travelling in a Mini Car with three   
 other girls towards Chatham.The car   
 spun off the road,killing three,one of
 whom was the bride-to-be.Since the    
 crash,motorists have reported         
 sightings of a young woman.Often on a 
 winter night,a girl clad in summer    
 dress is seen hitching a lift.She     
 later disappears in mysterious        
 circumstances.Police have been        
 involved on several occasions.At one  
 time ,a man thought that he had hit a 
 girl on this road.He wrapped her in a 
 rug by the side of the road and       
 contacted Rochester Police.They       
 arrived to find only the crumpled     
 rug.Itensive searches revealed nothing</content>
