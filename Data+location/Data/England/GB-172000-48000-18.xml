		<content> Prominent in the area are three       
 churches - the Roman Catholic "Our    
 Lady of the Sea" in Trevaunance Road, 
 the Anglican Parish Church in Church- 
 town, and the Methodist Church in     
 British Road.  The oldest one is the  
 Parish Church, built some time before 
 1331 - the exact date is not known.   
 The font is very old and carved from  
 Catacluse stone.  The carved painted  
 figure that holds the alms box is     
 another ancient survivor, probably    
 dating from Queen Elizabeth I.        
 Services in the Parish Church are held
 four times on Sundays, and are        
 reasonably well attended.             
 The Methodist Church has undergone a  
 sweeping change recently, being made  
 into a single-storey church on the    
 first floor and a large hall on the   
 ground floor.  The church and the     
 Sunday School are both very active.   </content>
