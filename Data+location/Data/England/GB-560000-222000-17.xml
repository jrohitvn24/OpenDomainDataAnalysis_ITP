		<content>   Most families in our survey live in 
 private houses,ranging from living on 
 farms to detatched and semi_detatched 
 houses on the new estates.Most houses 
 are brick built except the older ones 
 which are wood and plaster. We found  
 out that 20 families have moved into  
 Dunmow recently because of a new job, 
 although the new job was rarely in    
 Dunmow.The recent extension to the M11
 the M25 has meant that London and     
 other large towns are more accessible.
 Most people find Dunmow a friendly    
 enviroment to live in but they do not 
 think the shopping facilities are     
 adequate,so families go to Braintree  
 Harlow and Bishop's Stortford for some
 of their shopping.Every family has a  
 phone and a garden.Many families have 
 labour saving equipment in their homes
 Many people are worried about the     
 changes when Stansted Airport develops</content>
