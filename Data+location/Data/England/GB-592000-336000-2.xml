		<title>02The Holy House</title>
		<content> In 1061{Richeldis},a Saxon widow,was  
 commanded by the{Virgin Mary}to       
 build,in Walsingham,a replica of her  
 childhood house in{Nazareth}.As the   
 site had not been made clear          
 Richeldis,needing guidance,spent the  
 night in prayer.The following morning 
 she walked in a nearby meadow and     
 found two areas free of dew.She chose 
 the one by two holy wells.At first the
 workmen could make no progress with   
 their building and so the worried lady
 spent a further night in prayer.At    
 sunrise she ventured out and found her
 little house complete and miraculously
 transported to the other site almost  
 seventy metres away.In 1153 an{       
{Augustinian}priory was founded and{The
{Holy House}was later encased in a     
 stone chapel beside the nave of a     
 great church and a monastic complex.
