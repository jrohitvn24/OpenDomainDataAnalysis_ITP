<title>21A day in the life</title>
<content>

On Saturday I had my football presentation and I got a little trophy.  I got some chips, I also won the raffle for my mum. She had two tickets for the comedy club but I can’t go because there were for adults. I don’t know who she is taking, but probably her friend or her boyfriend.&lt;br />&lt;br />After the raffle there was a disco and some auction prizes. We bid for a Charlton top because my dad likes Charlton but we didn’t win. We bid £70 pounds the winner buddied £120.  I felt happy that I got a trophy, my manager got the manager of the year award I was really pleased he got this.    &lt;br />
