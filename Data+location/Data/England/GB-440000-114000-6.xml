    The Bassett area is crossed by a   
 number of main routes, for example,   
 the Winchester Road which leads out of
 Southampton towards Winchester, and   
 Burgess Road which forms part of a    
 ring road system. All the main roads  
 are used by a number bus routes.      
 (Health)                              
     There was a dentist's surgery near
 the shops and a doctor's surgery      
 placed in a lousing area. A centre for
 the Blind serves the whole area and   
 there are two Old Peoples' homes.     
 (Education and Recreation)            
     There are only two schools in this
 area. Vermont school is a primary     
 school but Red Lodge school serves    
 pupils with special needs from all the
 city.                                 
     There are tennis courts, a cricket
 ground and a running track.           </content>
