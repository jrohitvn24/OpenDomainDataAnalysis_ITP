		<content> I wake up on my farm at 7.30 a.m.I get
 dressed and go outside to feed my     
 three ducks.Then I have my breakfast.I
 usually have a bowl of cereal with    
 milk.I then get ready for school,pack 
 my bag and leave home at 8.30.My      
 mother takes me 2 and a half miles to 
 school in her small mini car.School   
 begins at 9 a.m we work until 12 a.m  
 with a short break to play at 10.45   
 a.m.At 12.00 we walk down to the      
 village institute to have our         
 lunch.Lunch is cooked in the          
 institute.When we have all finished we
 return to school.Afternoon school     
 begins at 1.15 p.m and continues until
 3.30 p.m.I usually go home in a school
 taxi.This takes ten children home     
 along the very narrow winding         
 lanes.When I get home I usually watch 
 television until 6 p.m when I have    
 supper.                               </content>
