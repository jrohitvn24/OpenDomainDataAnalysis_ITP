 I have been very unique,because I have
 played in the boys football team even 
 though I am a girl!However the F.A.   
 have tried to stop girls playing in   
 matches,but I think its unfair.       
 "What was it like playing in the foot-
 ball team,Helen?"                     
 "It was rather strange at first,but I 
 got used to it.I played in defence and
 had to tackle several boys to stop    
 them scoring a goal_they did not like 
 it."                                  </content>
