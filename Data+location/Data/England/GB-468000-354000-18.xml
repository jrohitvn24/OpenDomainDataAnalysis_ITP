		<title>18SEWAGE IN SOUTHWELL</title>
		<content> People living in the{Leeway Road area 
 of Southwell are concerned about the  
 state of the{sewers.} These were built
 many years ago.  Now, because there   
 are so many more houses being built,  
 these sewers do not have enough room  
 to take all the sewage.  This means   
 that when it rains heavily the bottom 
 end of Leeway Road can be{flooded.    
 The local council are looking into the
 matter and have tried to fid out      
 exactly what the trouble is.  However,
 the{building}still goes on!
