		<content> Most of the present day buildings were
 built in a similar style about 100    
 years ago by{Joseph Hirst}and William 
 Lever, the first{Viscount Leverhulme.}
{Hirst}was a{wealthy}man who lived in  
 the White House next to the present   
 Primary School. He built a church,    
 vicarage and school. In 1891 he       
{sold }Thornton Manor to William Lever.
 There are{two churches}in Thornton    
 Hough. The parish church of{All       
{Saints}has{five clock faces}on its    
 tower because{Joseph Hirst}was unable 
 to see the church clock from his house
 so he had built a smaller clock above 
 the east clock.{St. George's,}now a   
 United Reformed Church, was built as a
{replica}of a Norman Church both inside
 and out. Leverhulme replaced an old   
 smithy with a new smithy complete with
 a chestnut tree in front. It is still 
 in use today.                         </content>
