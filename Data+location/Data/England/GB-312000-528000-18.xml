		<title>18Cockermouth Town Council</title>
		<content> Established in 1974 as a third-tier   
 consultative body in local government,
 the Town Council has twelve elected   
 members from two Wards (Castle and All
 Saints'). There are 2400 voters in    
 Castle Ward and 2800 in All Saints'   
 Ward.  The Town Mayor acts as Chairman
 at the monthly meetings in the Town   
 Hall.  Committees meet in the Victoria
 Hall. Councillors are elected and     
 serve for four years. The Council is  
 responsible for allotment gardens,    
 tourism and publicity, the Victoria   
 Hall (a refurbished chapel), Christmas
 illuminations and twinning with       
 Marvejols.  The Council is proud of   
 the refurbished Victoria Hall, the    
 twinning with Marvejols and the eighty
 five voluntary associations and clubs 
 active in the town and district. The  
 council would like to establish a     
 Heritage Trail (Fletcher Christian).  </content>
