 and is used for clubs, bingo, the     
 annual Flower Show, public            
 performances of plays, jumble sales   
 and other social events. There is a   
 resident policeman in Kingsland.      
 Postal services include collections   
 from post boxes once daily and twice  
 daily from the post office. Postal    
 deliveries are made once daily except

 kiosks in the area.  Accommodation is 
 available for visitors at one inn and 
 two bed and breakfast establishments. 
 A mobile library visits the area once
