		<content> The{Electricity Board}sent two        
 gentlemen to talk to us about their   
 recent work in{Broughton Astley}.The  
 transmission lines have been replaced.
 They are made of aluminium.This work  
 is only carried out every quarter of a
 century.We will be thirty five when   
 this happens again.                   
  The workmen can move along the lines 
 in special trolleys.Nets prevent the  
 wires from trailing on the roads.     
{ Broughton Astley's}power comes from  
{ Hinckley}via{Stoney Stanton}.It is   
 transformed down t0 240 volts to use  
 in homes and schools.                 
  We visited a local field to look at a
 pylon.We were interested to learn     
 about the glass insulators which      
 prevent electricity travelling down to
 earth via the steel pylon.
