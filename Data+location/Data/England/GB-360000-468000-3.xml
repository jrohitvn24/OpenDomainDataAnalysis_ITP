		<title>03DAIRY FARMERS AND THE EEC.</title>
		<content> A major problem for dairy farmers in  
 this area came when EEC quotas were   
 brought in overnight in April 1984    
 with no warning. It was stated that   
 only the same amount of milk produced 
 in 1983 would be allowed to be        
 produced, less 9%. Many farmers had to
 reduce their herds and others who were
 in the middle of expanding were left  
 with various bills to pay and no need 
 for the expansion. Many went bankrupt 
 and had to sell. Dairy farmers turned 
 to beef and sheep farming and tourism 
 as alternatives. A levy of 2p a litre 
 was introduced should the farmers     
 exceed their quota. Some farmers have 
 over-produced and others              
 under-produced so that at present it  
 is balanced.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
