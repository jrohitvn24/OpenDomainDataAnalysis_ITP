		<title>09THE BELL AT OVERTON SCHOOL</title>
		<content>  The school was built in 1824 and the 
 bell first rung in 1892. It was rung  
 for 5 minutes each morning to call the
 children to school.Those who were late
 were caned.  The bell was silent      
 during the war but it was rung on     
 V.E.Day - 8th May 1945. It has not    
 rung since.  The headteacher for the  
 spring term 1985, Mr.G.Phillips,      
 proposed that the bell should be      
 restored. Mr.F.Whitehead, of          
 Northwich, did the major work whilst  
 Renfors U.K.Limited treated the       
 timber. The bell will be rung at 2pm  
 on Tuesday 2nd July by Mr. George     
 Arthur Warburton, aged 99 years, the  
 oldest living ex-pupil. Former pupils 
 have been invited for a tour of the   
 school and party after the ceremony.  
  It is planned to ring the bell at    
 8.55 am and 12.55 pm each school day, 
 5 minutes before the start of school. </content>
