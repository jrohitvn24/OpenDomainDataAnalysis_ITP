 Mr J Rideout, gamekeeper at Goodwood, 
 is hoping to rear 10,000 pheasants    
 this year. Earlier in the year he     
 caught 600 birds for breeding. There  
 are an estimated 82 acres of forest   
 rich with pheasants. Every shooting   
 season the average of 500 birds are   
 shot, 158 of them are Mr Rideouts. The
 shooting season lasts from October 1st
 to January 31st.                      
 We visited Mr Rideout's hatchery and  
 saw the incubators and watched the    
 pheasant chicks as they hatched. We   
 were invited to come in and hold them.
 They are released into the surrounding
 woods when they are six weeks old.    
 The rich chalk deposits in the Downs  
 supply crystals which are collected by
 Mr Rideout's son.
