		<title>10Housing in Clive</title>
		<content> Clive is a very attractive village    
 with a population of about 500 people,
 situated on the south-western side of 
 the Grinshill. The style of housing   
 varies greatly. Many houses were built
 about 200-300 years ago and are       
 grouped together in the older area of 
 the village.  These house are usually 
 made out of red or cream sandstone or 
 red brick and many have a pebble dash 
 exterior. Roofs are usually made from 
 grey slate and the buildings often    
 have sash windows. The newer houses in
 Clive are made from red brick and have
 tiled roofs with metal or wooden      
 windows frames, many with double      
 glazing. Most houses have large       
 gardens and at least one garage.Most  
 are detached or semi-detached. Clive  
 Hall in the main street of the        
 village has 16th  century herringbone 
 bricks covered with rendering.        </content>
