		<title>15Farming - Cattle and Sheep</title>
		<content> There is no dairying here but 5 of the
 10 farms run beef cow suckler herds,  
 the other 4 summer graze and fatten   
 store cattle. Main breed of cow is    
 Hereford cross with Charolais and some
 Limousin bulls used. The immediate    
 past chairman of the British Charolais
 Society, Colin Campbell, has his herd 
 at Thrunton. The incoming Chairman of 
 the British Limousin Society farms at 
 Lumbylaw. These are the dominant beef 
 breeds nationally at present. Sheep   
 occupy slightly more land however with
 flocks of mule ewes, (blue-face       
 Leicester and blackface) predominantly
  There are also Cheviot and scottish  
 half-breeds. Suffolk rams are popular,
 Texels are used on 2 of the farms.    
 The sheep, except at Thrunton Redhouse
 are largely outwintered but many farms
 house the cattle in winter.
