		<content>      One holiday we went around all   
 the{Channel Islands}in our boat. The  
 first place we went was{Cherbourg     
 which is in{France.}This is my        
 favourite place because you can do    
 any thing you like in the harbour. My 
 sister and I have got a{sailing dinghy
 called a{Puffin}which we sail in      
 there. One day a gust of wind caught  
 us and we capsized and got blown onto 
 the beach. The people who teach       
 sailboarding on the sand shouted at us
 but we could not understand them. We  
 sailed back and I got our rubber      
 dinghy with an engine. I was planing  
 and broke the drivepin on the slipway.
 I rowed back and Dad mended it and    
 told me to take the rubbish ashore.   
 After that I went fishing with        
 Johnathan and caught a fish.
