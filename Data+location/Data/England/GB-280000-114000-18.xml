		<content> Witheridge Parish Council has ten     
 membersand have been very active for  
 many years. They have taken a keen    
 interest in the village and village   
 activities and have started many new  
 ventures. A few years ago they held a 
 village appraisal and all the         
 residents were asked for their views  
 about different aspects of village    
 life. As a result of this there were a
 number of developments. A newindoor   
 bowling club was started, transport   
 facilities were improved, a village   
 magazine was started and there were   
 various other activities started. The 
 Council meet every month and meetings 
 are also attended by members of the   
 public.
