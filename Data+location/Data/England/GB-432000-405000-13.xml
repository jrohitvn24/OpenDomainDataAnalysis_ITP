		<content> Much of the new private housing has   
 been built in the last 20 years and is
 mainly detached or semi-detached and  
 bungalows.Today people want homes with
 gardens,garages,central heating and   
 well equipped kitchens,and many want  
 to buy their own home rather than rent
 it.                                   
  Council tenants may now buy their own
 council house,and some have chosen to 
 do so.                                
  The council is now concentrating on  
 the building of homes for senior      
 citizens and physically handicapped   
 people.
