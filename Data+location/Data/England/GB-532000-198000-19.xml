		<content>        M25 TRAFFIC SURVEY             
 On Friday 17th May 1985 some children 
 from Capel Manor School did a traffic 
 survey on the M.(Motorway) 25. First  
 we did the west going traffic. There  
 were 345 cars, 133 lorries, 36 vans, 2
 motorbikes, 5 coaches and 6 caravans. 
 Then we went on to the east going     
 traffic. There were 410 cars, 146     
 lorries, 48 vans, 2 motorbikes, 4     
 coaches and 1 caravan. We found out   
 that there was more traffic going east
 than west. We think it is because the 
 M25 ends ' miles later if you go west.
 The M25 will be finished in 1986. We  
 did this for half an hour from 9.52am 
 to 10.am, 15 minutes on each side.    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
