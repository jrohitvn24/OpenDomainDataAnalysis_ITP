		<content> On the whole people have to make there
 own recreation as there no places of  
 public entertainment.There are two    
 Public Houses,The Sportmans Arms and  
 The Victoria Inn. Both these Pubs run 
 darts teams for ladies and gents. In  
 addition they have Pool tables which  
 are popular. There is a Womens        
 Institute which is well supported and 
 meets regularly in our School.The     
 village has a very good and widely    
 respected Male Voice Choir which      
 competes in festivals all over the    
 country with great success.There is a 
 Mens Institute which is supported     
 mainly by the older men of the        
 village.
