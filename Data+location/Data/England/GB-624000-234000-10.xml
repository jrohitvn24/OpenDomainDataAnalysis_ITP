		<title>10Trimley St.Mary Church-Plans</title>
		<content>  People driving past are very         
surprised to see that Trimley has two  
churches in the same churchyard.       
Trimley St. Martin used to have its own
rector and services were held in both  
churches at the same time.  Now one    
rector looks after both villages and   
services are held in each church on    
alternate weeks. The congregation has  
to pay to keep two churches open.      
  There is no church hall and sometimes
the churches are not big enough to hold
everyone. The Rector showed us some    
plans which will solve these problems. 
  St.Martin's church will be made a    
little bigger and St.Mary's will be    
divided up,making the vestry into a    
meeting room, the chancel into a       
chapel,the nave into a hall and the    
tower into a kitchen. The Rector says  
that churches have often been altered  
in the past.People should not object.  </content>
