		<title>12HARTHILL SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Harthill-with-Woodall School was      
 opened on May 13th 1878; its first    
 Headmaster was Mr John Henry Kilburn, 
 and it was governed by the            
 Harthill-with-Woodall School Board,   
 whose name is carved in the stonework 
 of the main school building.          
 Originally the school had three       
 separate departments, for Boys, Girls,
 and Infants, and Log Books still exist
 recording the daily life of the school
 from its opening day. The school      
 eventually came under the control of  
 the West Riding County Council and    
 then, in 1974, under that of Rotherham
 Borough Council. It is, of course, now
 a Junior and Infant School. At present
 (July,1985) there are 160 children    
 aged from 5 to 11 in the school,      
 arranged in six classes. At 11 the    
 children go to Wales Comprehensive    
 School which is about 3 miles away.   </content>
