		<content> For years refuse had been collected in
 metal dustbins. Recently a new system 
 has been introduced. Refuse is now put
 in plastic sacks &amp; placed at the      
 property boundary. Exempted are the   
 old &amp; disabled, their rubbish is      
 collected as usual. Objections are:   
 residents do the dustmens' job; sacks 
 are an eyesore &amp; cause obstructions;  
 sacks are too flimsy &amp; animals can rip
 them open spilling rubbish. They also 
 say they were not consulted. The      
 council says it has saved Â£430,000    
 p.a. with this system. It only takes 2
 minutes a week to put out sacks. Sacks
 are strong enough. Not as much rubbish
 is spilled. The decision was taken at 
 an Open Meeting which was not well    
 attended. In a survey of 150 people,  
 50% liked the new scheme and 50% did  
 not.
