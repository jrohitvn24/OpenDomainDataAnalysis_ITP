 There is nothing in this grid square  
 worth reporting except Potland Burn.  
 This is just a small stream. Potland  
 farm is also in the grid which is     
 a small arable farm.                  
                                       
                                       
       Old Moor Cottage                
 Old Moor Cottage once belonged to     
 Bothal Estate. In 1898 the land around
 Old Moor was split up into different  
 parts and sold. Mr Scarlet's family   
 have owned the house since 1938. The  
 house was heated by an open fire and  
 lit by oil lamps and then by an       
 electric generator. Electricity was   
 installed in 1963. The house has      
 recently been changed by solid fuel   
 heating which was installed about 9   
 years ago.
