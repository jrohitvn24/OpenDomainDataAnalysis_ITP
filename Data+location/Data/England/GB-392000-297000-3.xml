		<title>03UNDERGROUND SERVICES</title>
		<content>Some services that enter our homes come
through overland cables,but most pass  
underground e.g.Telephones, Sewage,    
Gas Water and Electricity. We found    
evidence of these services in the      
streets. We saw inspection covers for  
drains, gas   pipes,stop-taps and      
hydrants which provide water for fire  
fighting. The water we use has to be   
cleaned. This is done by the Severn    
Trent Water Board which treats 2600    
megalitres of sewage each day. First   
it enters a tank in which most of the  
large waste settles out. Next, the     
sludge is removed and methane gas is   
extracted and this can be used to      
generate electricty. The water is then 
cleaned in another tank by bacteria    
which feed on the waste. The clean     
water,now harmless to wildlife, is then
pumped into a river.
