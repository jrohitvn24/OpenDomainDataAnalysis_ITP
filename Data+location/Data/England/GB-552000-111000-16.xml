 As the organist at Chiddingly I meet  
many people. Although the town is      
widely spread out there is usually a   
good turn out on a Sunday. The types of
people range from the fanatical        
religous to the Â£I suppose I better go 
to chuch as it's Christmas !'.         
                                       
 Every year in August or October the   
Chiddingly Music Festival is held in   
the church. This is a big festival     
which attracts performers from all     
round the county and is often recorded 
for broadcasting on the radio.         
                                       
 Chiddingly is a close knit community  
and I feel priveliged to be            
accepted as one of them since coming   
from outside only a year ago.
