		<content> The block is roughly divided into{3}  
 main areas.In the West is{Shepshed,}a 
 thriving village which has expanded   
 over recent years.In the East is a    
 residential region of{Loughborough,}  
 much of which has been built over the 
 last decade.Dividing these communities
 is the{Garendon Estate,}owned by the  
{Squire De Lisle.}Much of this is      
 devoted to arable farming,interspersed
 with mixed woods and plantations.     
 Some light industry and some quarrying
 is to be found in the Shepshed region.
 The{Thorpe Acre}and{Dishley}areas of  
 Loughborough have no such industry but
 can boast a Hypermarket and the campus
 of{Loughborough University.}          
 The{A512}is the main road linking the 
 two communities;the railway has been  
 dismantled.The{M1}motorway provides   
 the region with an excellent access   
 service in the form of{Junction 23.}  </content>
