		<title>07WESTGATE ABBATOIR</title>
		<content>   In Westgate at High Town there is an
 abattoir. It has been a slaughter     
 house since 1961. Sheep and cattle are
 killed. They come from Nattrass'      
 Council farm at Daddry Shield and from
 the fat cattle mart. Cattle are killed
 by running them in to a cattle crush, 
 lowering a bar on to their heads and  
 shooting them. To kill the sheep you  
 have to lie them on a table, tie their
 legs together and shoot them in the   
 head. Three people work there.        
                                       
                                       
   There is also a butchers shop at the
 abattoir. Customers come from all over
 the North East of England.They once   
 had a travelling butchers van but now 
 people phone in and collect their     
 orders or have the meat delivered.
