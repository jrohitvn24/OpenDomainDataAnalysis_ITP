		<title>20Odcombe V.A. Primary School</title>
		<content> The school has been here for just over
 150 years. The long Victorian building
 is of Ham-stone and is divided into   
 two classes. A modern, additional     
 classroom and small playground are    
 reached by stairs. Behind the school  
 there is a lawn with a small pond and 
 a large oak tree, planted by previous 
 pupils. There are 52 children, most   
 from the village and some from the    
 nearby navy camp. There are three     
 teacher and one part timer. About a   
 dozen children have dinners brought   
 from a secondary school kitchen but   
 most children bring a packed lunch.   
 Many village schools are under threat 
 of closure on economic grounds - both 
 Odcombe and Montacute (which is a     
 smaller school) have so far been      
 lucky.
