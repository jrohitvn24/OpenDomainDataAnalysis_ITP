		<content>  In our homes today many of us have a 
 microcoputer.We use computers in many 
 different ways,for playing games,     
 information processing and learning in
 schools.The computer is now used in   
 all kinds of jobs. Some well known    
 computers are the Commodore, BBC      
 Micro, and the Spectrum. The price of 
 these varies but is up to Â£500.  In   
 our class 15 children out of 32 have  
 computers. We have 5 children with a  
 Commodore, 2 with a BBC, 4 with a     
 Spectrum, 1 with an Amstrad, 1 with an
 Atari and 1 with an Oric.  I asked the
 children in our class which computer  
 game they liked best.11 said Football,
 11 said Decathlon, 6 Ghostbusters, 5  
 Horace, 2 Basketball and 1 Elite.
