		<title>07ST. ANN'S HILL, CHERTSEY</title>
		<content>      We went to St. Ann s Hill and Mrs
 Smart took some photographs. St.Ann s 
 Hill is a contrast to the rest of the 
 surrounding country side which is very
 flat.  There used to be a chapel but  
 it is very odd that not even the ruins
 can be seen.  Charles James Fox, a    
 parliamentarian of the l8th century   
 used to live in a house on the        
 hillside.                             
      We climbed up the hill and saw   
 Thorpe Park and Heathrow Airport.  We 
 saw a plane taking off.  We saw a     
 thick tree with an orange trunk.      
 There was a swing on one of the trees 
 made from a rope and a plastic bag.   
 Everywhere around were lots of        
 rhododendrons.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
