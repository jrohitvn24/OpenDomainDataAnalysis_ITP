		<content> The Salvation Army is a national      
 organisation founded by William Booth 
 in 1871,with groups in over 83        
 countries.During the 2nd World War the
 main headquarters in London was       
 bombed,so General Lyndon Carpenter    
 moved them to Sandridge village where 
 they stayed for a number of           
 years.Now Lyndon House is an old      
 peoples home and has accommodation for
 27 people,ladies over 60 and men over 
 65,the oldest resident is 97 and the  
 youngest 73.The residents come from   
 outside the Sandridge area.The people 
 must be sponsored by their county.They
 are allowed a maximum of Â£300 in the  
 bank and if possible they contribute  
 towards their living expenses.The home
 is set in pleasant surroundings with a
 large garden.
