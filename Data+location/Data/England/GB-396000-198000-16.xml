{CENTRE.                               
   IN 1979 AN AGRONOMY TRIALS UNIT WAS 
 SET UP BY A FARMER DISCUSSION GROUP   
 AND WAS CALLED THE COTSWOLD CEREAL    
 CENTRE. IT IS FARMER FINANCED AND HAS 
 MADE A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO THE
 TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE AND HUSBANDRY     
 APPROACH   ADOPTED  BY  ITS  MEMBERS. 
 THE  CENTRE  PRODUCES INDEPENDENT     
 INFORMATION  ON  CEREALS  AND  OTHER  
 COMBINABLE CROPS. THE KNOWLEDGE AND   
 EXPERIENCE  IS  OFFERED  TO  OTHER    
 INTERESTED GROUPS OF FARMERS.         
                                       
   THE  CENTRE IS  BASED  AT THE ROYAL 
 AGRICULTURAL  COLLEGE  AT  CIRENCESTER
 WHERE OFFICES AND FACILITIES ARE MADE 
 AVAILABLE.  LAND  FOR  THE  TRIALS  IS
 RENTED  FROM  THE  COLLEGE  AND  OTHER
 LOCAL FARMERS.
