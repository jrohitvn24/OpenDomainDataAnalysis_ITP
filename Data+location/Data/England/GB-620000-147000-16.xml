sculptures are mainly about            
people.William the Conqueror gave      
Denne Hill to the Denne family.The     
present house was built in the         
1870's.When Nicholas Treadwell bought  
Denne Hill in 1977 it was in a very    
bad state of repair and threatened by  
demolition.Now people come from all    
over the world to see the exhibits.The 
sculptures are made out of fibreglass  
and leather and some are even made out 
of toy guns.                           
  Broome Park was built in April 1635.

facilities like golf,tennis and        
swimming.There are also Time Share     
villas where people can stay for       
their holidays each year.Lord Kitchener
bought the house in 1911.During World  
War II a Canadian tank regiment was    
stationed there.                       </content>
