		<title>10LOCAL SERVICES RAVENGLASS</title>
		<content> Within the village most services are  
 provided,if only on a rather basic    
 level due to low population numbers.  
 There is a well-supported shop/post   
 office, butcher and milkman.A local   
 fisherman sails a small trawler from  
 the harbour and sells fish directly   
 from it(except when adverse publicity 
 about Sellafield affects his business)
 In the summer there is a fish and chip
 shop and ice-cream van catering for   
 the visitors as do the gift shops(in  
 the village, at the castle and at the 
 R&amp;E Railway station).The coalmerchant,
 library,window cleaners,and refuse    
 collectors regularly visit the village
 but the outlying farms are less well  
 served. There is no doctor's surgery  
 and the area is served by a medical   
 centre at Seascale,7mls away,which    
 operates an appointment system with   
 medical staff all making home visits. </content>
