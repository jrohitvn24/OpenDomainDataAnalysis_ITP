		<title>20An Alton School</title>
		<content>    Children from the ages of 7 to 11  
 attend our school. We have a main     
 building and a smaller, newer, module 
 building. We have 9 classrooms in use,
 with about 30 children in each class. 
 Three other rooms are used for a      
 library and resources area, for music,
 and for television.                   
    We have two playgrounds and two    
 large fields. In the winter the boys  
 play football and the girls play      
 netball, in the summer the boys play  
 cricket and the girls play rounders.  
 In the last 12 years we have planted  
 many young trees which will one day   
 give shade to the children here.      
                                       
    These pages were written, edited

 Anstey County Junior School, Alton,   
 and their teachers.
