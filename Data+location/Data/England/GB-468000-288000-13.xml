		<title>13FARM LIFE IN FOXTON</title>
		<content> 75%of our area is farmland.This is    
 almost evely divided between grass for
 grazing and sileage and cultivated    
 crops.Today the E.E.C. policy on      
 farming can be seen taking effect as  
 there are crops such as Oil seed      
 rape growing in fields which used to  
 be all wheat,corn,barley or oats.The  
 latter are still grown as well to day 
 but because of subsidies and          
 regulations farmers cannot grow what  
 they want where they want even if they
 do own the land.                      
 Of the 7 farms in our area 4 are owned
 and run by local farmers,the other 3  
 are owned by people living away and   
 employing a manager to run the        
 business.                             
 There is 1 Dairy farm in our 7,the    
 rest are mixed arable i.e.cattle and  
 crops
