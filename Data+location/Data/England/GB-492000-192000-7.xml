		<title>07The Winchmore Hill Store.</title>
		<content> This is an account of a shop,and its  
{trade}in Winchmore Hill.              
   Built in the 1930's,the shop has    
 seen little change in either trade or 
 appearance.Most of the customers are  
 local,but there is some trade from    
 people passing through.Trade has      
 increased,however,since the new owners
 took over seven years ago.            
  The shop is a general store and sells
 a wide range of goods,from food to    
 soap powder,and provides for most of  
 the villagers daily needs.Anything    
 that the shop does not stock has to be
 purchased from larger stores in nearby
 large towns.                          
  The owners buy their stock in bulk   
 from the Cash and Carry as well as    
 supplies from sales.                  
   The shop was converted two years ago
 from counter service to self service  
 to make shopping easier.              </content>
