   The area consists of a section of   
the North Downs intersected by the A225
road and a railway. These cross the    
Pilgrims' Way which runs along the     
lower slopes. Most of the village of   
Otford , part of Shoreham and the edge 
of Kemsing are included. The area is   
mainly woodland and rough grazing with 
intensive farming in the Darent Valley.
The woodland has natural flora of      
considerable interest and a few        
scattered farms and hamlets.           
   The village of Otford (population c.
4000) is home to many commuters who use
the service to London. It has a        
picturesue centre with pond, green and 
old church; several mediaeval, Georgian
and Victorian houses 2and good         
amenities with close proximity to      
London and the motorway network.
