		<title>17Pigeon Tower / The Dovecote.</title>
		<content> The precise history of the  {Pigeon   
{Tower}or  {Dovecote}is unknown.  Some 
 think that it was orginally a lookout 
 tower, or part of the old Abbey,      
 whilst others think it may have been a
 dwelling of some sort.  Undoubtedly,  
 the building was used as a pigeon loft
 and includes spaces for 200 nests.    
 Furthermore, there is clear evidence  
 that the building once had a floor at 
 first storey level and a fireplace;   
 windows have been altered and some    
 have been blocked.  A drawing of the  
 building in the early 18th century    
 shows that it had a chimney and a     
 roof.  It is very much a building     
 surrounded by mystery, and is now in  
 the care of the National Trust.
