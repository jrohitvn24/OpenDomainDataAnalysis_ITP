		<title>05Scotton/Northorpe: Education</title>
		<content> 18 children from 2\ upwards go to     
 Scotton Pre-School Playgroup which in 
 term time has 3 morning sessions a    
 week in the village hall, with 2 paid 
 supervisors and a rota of voluntary   
 helpers; fees are 80p a session. A    
 Mother and Toddler Group meets weekly,
 except in summer. Scotton school      
 closed in 1931; most 5-11 year olds go
 to Scotter Primary School (transport  
 is provided from Northorpe). Currently
 at 11+ children may opt for Huntcliff 
 School (11-16 comprehensive) at Kirton
 Lindsey, or (if they sit the 11+ exam)
 one of the Gainsborough Schools: Queen
 Elizabeth's High (grammar 11-18) or   
 Castle Hills (secondary modern 11-16).
 Most choose Huntcliff, some           
 continuing 16-18 at Scunthorpe.       
 Changes in secondary education in this
 area appear inevitable. 2 Scotton     
 girls are at present at university.   </content>
