		<content> I wake up in the morning and go to    
 the loo. Then I have my breakfast and 
 a cup of tea. For breakfast I usually 
 have cereal and toast. I have a wash, 
 clean my teeth and get dressed for    
 school. I take my school bag with my  
 reading books and my recorder in it.  
 When I get to school we have assembly.
 The teacher talks to us and we sing   
 songs and tell our news. Usually we do
 our maths and writing and go out to   
 play. At dinner time I have my packed 
 lunch -sandwiches or a roll and fruit.
 Sometimes I have crisps or yoghurt. At
 the end of school my mum takes me home
 and I have a drink and a biscuit. When
 it is nice weather I play in the      
 garden with my brother or my friend. I
 have a bike and a sandpit and a swing.
 Sometimes I watch television and then 
 I have my tea. It is usually a cooked 
 meal like meat and cabbage and        </content>
