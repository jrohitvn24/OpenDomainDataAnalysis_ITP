 The parents of children at Langtree   
 County Primary School are worried     
 about losing a teacher because of     
 falling numbers of children.          
 The farmers are concerned at a 10% cut
 in milk quotas, which means a cut in  
 income.                               
 A committee has been formed to keep   
 the Church Hall in use.               
 House holders who have recently       
 purchased their Council houses are    
 disturbed that they are expected to   
 pay to have their approach road       
 resurfaced.                           
 The new Torridge District Council     
 structure plan for some 50-60 houses  
 would require a new sewer. The        
 authorities will not provide the sewer
 unless the houses are built, so a     
 state of deadlock exists.
