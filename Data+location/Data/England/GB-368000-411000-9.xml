		<title>09STU FRANCIS ENTERTAINER</title>
		<content> We interviewed Stu Francis,the famous 
 family entertainer who lives in       
 Smithills.He likes living here because
 he is close to his family and         
 Smithills is a nice mixture of town   
 and country.It is also close to a good
 motorway system which is useful for   
 nationwide travelling.He was born in  
 Bolton in 1948.He first went on stage 
 at Butlins holiday camp in 1970.He is 
 often on television.He is the host of 
 Crackerjack and the Ultra Quiz.His    
 ambition used to be to play football  
 for Bolton Wanderers.He likes to keep 
 fit and has already run in 7          
 marathons.He told us that he still    
 suffers from nerves before a show.It  
 was hard to interview him because he  
 kept making us laugh.
