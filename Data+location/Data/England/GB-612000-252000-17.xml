		<content> Due to the National County Structure  
 Plan, only very limited development is
 permitted in certain villages such as 
 Hemingstone and many local people     
 there feel development on a very small
 scale would be most welcome to keep   
 the village viable. To try to keep the
 community spirit in spite of a        
 dwindling population, Hemingstone     
 started a "Meet your Neighbour" scheme
 in 1985. Once a month for one         
 afternoon, villagers are welcome to   
 meet in Hemingstone Hut to chat over a
 cup of tea. Also during the summer 3  
 or 4 Saturday morning markets are held
 in the Hut to raise money for Church  
 funds. Homemade cakes, homegrown      
 produce etc. is on sale. Newcomers to 
 the area find people very friendly and
 helpful and in the most part feel     
 protected from the pressures of less  
 attractive aspects of town life.      </content>
