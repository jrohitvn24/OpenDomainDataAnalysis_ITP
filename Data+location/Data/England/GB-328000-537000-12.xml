 The Cumbrian sport of HOUND TRAILING  
 has a good following. Before a trail  
 is held a man walks the route pulling 
 a drag soaked in aniseed. Each        
 participating hound is marked at the  
 start, so that no substitute can be   
 put in during the race which may cover
 considerable distances out of sight of
 spectators. The hounds are not fed    
 before being 'slipped' but are given a
 meal at the end of the race. Betting  
 takes place on the outcome.           </content>
