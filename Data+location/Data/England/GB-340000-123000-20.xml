		<content> John Leach is now spending more time  
 making individual pieces which are    
 very different to the domestic ware.It
 is exhibited and sold locally,in      
 London and in many other countries.   
 John Leach also travels widely talking
 and demonstrating his skills.He has   
 recently visited Alaska and Africa to 
 help build woodfired kilns for native 
 potters.Mrs Leach runs the shop and is
 responsible for all paperwork and     
 dispatching of orders.The shop is     
 visited by tourists but is well known 
 locally with many people buying the   
 pottery and using it daily in their   
 kitchens.The range includes:plates,   
 mugs,cups,coffee jugs,teapots,cider   
 jars,breadcrocks, porringers,mixing   
 bowls and storage jars.
