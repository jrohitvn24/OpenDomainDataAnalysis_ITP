		<title>05HOARWITHY BRIDGE</title>
		<content> For many centuries there has been a   
 crossing over the river Wye at        
 Hoarwithy connecting King's Caple with
 the main routes into ROSS AND         
 HEREFORD.Early Travellers used the    
 ford of ferry crossing,which were     
 replaced by a timber bridge in        
 1856.The resent iron structutre was   
 erected in 1876 and consists of a     
 narrow road bridge with a weight limit
 of 7tons,unsuitable for the heavy     
 machinery and vehicles of the         
 1980s.In1935 the Herefordshire County 
 Council purchased the bridge and freed
 it of tolls,since then they have      
 maintained the bridge,which is now in 
 a deterioratingstate.The inhabitants  
 of K.C.are reliant upon the           
 bridge,andfeel it should be replaced  
 with a stronger structure.The County  
 Council'see no possibility in the near
 future of the bridge being replaced.  </content>
