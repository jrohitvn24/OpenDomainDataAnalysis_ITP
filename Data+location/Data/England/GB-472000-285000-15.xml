		<title>15The Old Grammar School</title>
		<content> Standing in the centre of Market      
 Harborough is one of the towns        
 historic buildings- the unique old{   
{grammar school},which was endowed     
 in 1614 by a former Harborian,{Robert 
{Smyth,}who had prospered in London as 
 a merchant tailor and later as        
 controller of the city.As requested   
 by Robert Smyth the school was a      
 timber framed building supported by   
 wooden stilts with an open ground     
 floor which was to serve as a market  
 place for local people to sell        
 butter,and as a shelter from the foul 
 weather. He also stipulated that texts
 from scripture were to be painted on  
 the side of the structure and if      
 defaced or worn out were to be        
 renewed . This building was used as a 
 schoolroom for over three hundred and 
 fifty years. Nowadays it is used for  
 coffee mornings and jumble sales.     </content>
