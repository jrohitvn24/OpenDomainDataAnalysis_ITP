		<title>12EEL FISHING</title>
		<content>{Mr Wraight}came to our classroom      
 yesterday morning after playtime. Mr  
 Wraight brought an {eel}in to our     
 classroom. The colour of the eel was a
 greyish silver. These are some of the{
{amazing things}about eels. Eels{teeth}
 grow{backwards}so that they can keep  
 hold of the things they are biting.   
 Another amazing thing about eels is   
 that they can{climb walls.}They can   
 also{twist}their own{heads off!}They  
 can{live out of water}till sunset,and 
 last of all they can{go across fields.
 Eels will wriggle when they are half  
 cooked! Nets are made with a certain  
 number of rings with net over. Mr     
 Wraight catches eels to sell to the   
 market in{London.}Mr Wraight brought  
 in a net the net was about 2\metres   
 long. Eels can{eat almost anything.
