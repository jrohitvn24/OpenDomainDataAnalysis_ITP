		<content> Not many people go to church these    
 days because they're not sure about   
 God and they are too busy. But some   
 people do believe in God.Some people  
 go to the Church of England,some      
 people go to the Baptist church, and  
 some people go to the Methodist       
 church.There are 3 Church of England  
 churches in our area. One is at       
 Hawkmoor hospital ( St Mary's was     
 built by the patient's for Â£2,000) One
 is in Bovey Tracey called St Peter, St
 Paul and St Thomas a Becket,the other 
 St,Marys,is in Hennock.Only 5 out of  
 31 children in our class go to church 
 and that is the church of England.Two 
 children are Jehovahs Witnesses and   
 they meet in Newton Abbot.
