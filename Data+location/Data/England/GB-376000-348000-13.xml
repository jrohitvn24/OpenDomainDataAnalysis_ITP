		<title>13TRANSPORT TO SCHOOL CONT.</title>
		<content>DISTANCE: The school is located in     
Halmerend.However,only 14% of the      
pupils live in the village (i.e.&lt;1km   
away).This is unusual because schools  
are normally located near the centre of
their catchment area.The majority of   
pupils actually come from Bignall End  
and Audley,the two largest villages in 
the parish.Halmerend sends so few      
pupils because it is no longer as      
important as it used to be.            
TIME: It is very difficult to explain  
the results because 66% take &lt;20mins   
which suggests they either live close  
by or they have a short car or bus     
journey.The other 34% take >20mins     
which suggests they either have a long 
walk or they travel a long distance by 
bike or motor.
