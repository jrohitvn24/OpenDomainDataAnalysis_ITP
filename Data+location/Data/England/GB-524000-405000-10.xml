		<title>10A Survey of Bradley. Part 1.</title>
		<content> In our class we got into small groups 
 and wrote questions which we wanted to
 ask people. We then got together to   
 sort out any repetition. After we had 
 finished our{questionaire}we went out 
 in three groups to talk to people in  
 squares{2406 and 2407.}We spoke to{61 
 people and this is what we found. Well
 over half the people had lived in     
 their house less than{10 years.}Well  
 over half had moved into the area but 
 nearly all of those came from the     
 local area, only 8 from outside the   
 county. Nearly all expected to remain 
 in the area after{retirement.}Opinion 
 was fairly equally divided on the     
 plans for{2000 houses}etc. in square  
{2506,}most of the opposition was due  
 to fear of damage to{wildlife.}Nearly 
 all wanted to see local woods and open
 areas remain as{recreational
