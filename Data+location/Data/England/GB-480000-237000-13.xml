		<title>13THE SCHOOL CONSERVATION AREA</title>
		<content> The conservation area was started Feb 
 1984.Shrubs were planted to attract   
 nature.Soon after we had a drought the
 effects of which were not too bad but 
 some of the pond plants died even     
 though the ponds did not dry out.     
 Bradwell Village school was chosen    
 because the site already had some wild
 plants in it and was some way away    
 from the school.The children from the 
 school all helped to make it by       
 digging the ponds and helping to      
 preserve the plants there.The area was
 very successful.One amazing feature   
 was the butterfly population though   
 with the bad weather of 1985 it has   
 gone down.The ponds attracted animals 
 including hedgehogs,beetles and dragon
 flys.The crested newt was introduced  
 to the first pond to help prevent     
 extinction of this species.The area is
 used as part of the school curriculum.</content>
