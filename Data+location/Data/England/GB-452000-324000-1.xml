		<content>  The area under study is lowly        
 populated farming land,with the       
 exception of the village of East Leake
 which is situated at the N.E.corner of
 the block.                            
   East Leake has grown, in recent     
 times, from a small rural community   
 into a large village of some 6000     
 people.The reasons for the new housing
 are:-the proximatey of the M1,a nearby
 airport and power station,two local   
 universities,easy access to both heavy
 and light industry.                   
  The newcomers have arrived from all  
 over Great Britain and have settled in
 well.                                 
  The small village of West Leake lies 
 to the west of E.Leake                
  There are several farms within the   
 area.The farming is mixed and the soil
 is heavy.                             
                                       </content>
