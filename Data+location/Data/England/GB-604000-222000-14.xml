		<content>{ Mrs Allen:}Well the fish shop        
 has been there a long while.Owned  by 
 the owners uncle called Mr Edwin      
 Green.He owned it then on the corner  
 of Alma Street where Mr Marsturn      
 lived. Where the restaurant is now on 
 the corner of West street the         
 Bakehouse that was why it was called  
 The Bakehouse that used to be a bakers
 and they used to bake their own fresh 
 bread there.The ovens are there.If    
 you go into the back of the bakehouse 
 you can still see them because all the
 bread was cooked by coal and not by   
 steam not like it is now.The shop     
 where the paper shop is now they've   
 always been there but there was a big 
 fire severel years ago and it was all 
 burnt down.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
