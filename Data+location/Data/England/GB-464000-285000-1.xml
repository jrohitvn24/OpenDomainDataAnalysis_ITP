		<title>01INTRODUCING THEDDINGWORTH</title>
		<content> Our block consists of agricultural    
 land in S.E. Leicestershire with the  
 village of THEDDINGWORTH occupying the
 top of a narrow ridge running E-W for 
 about half a mile. The river Welland  
 to the south separates us from        
 Northamptonshire. The Grand Union     
 canal and the embankment of the       
 disused LMS railway run on the north  
 side parallel to the ridge.           
 We have described the{local history}  
 and{ecology}of this block, the present
{housing}and{home life.}We have written
 of{farming,}the{villagers,}their      
{employment}and{interests.             
 Even though the volume and noise of   
 the traffic along the busy A427       
 through the village might be regarded 
 as a disincentive to active village   
 life, the extent of the{interests}and 
{activities}we describe show that this 
 is a lively and friendly village.     </content>
