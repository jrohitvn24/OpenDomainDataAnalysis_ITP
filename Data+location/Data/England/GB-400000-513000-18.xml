		<title>18Gipsy Encampment</title>
		<content>  Gipsies are people who have abandoned
 an orthodox life-style to roam around 
 the countryside in caravans which are 
 their homes.There are two main types  
 of gipsy:Romany who are continually on
 the move and diddie-coys who spend    
 long periods of time in one place.The 
 Romany have horses which are used to  
 pull the brightly-coloured carts from 
 fair to fair.In this area they always 
 use{Boldron Lane}and{Thornberry Lane} 
 as encampments during their unhurried 
 journey to Appleby Fair.They graze the
 horses by the roadside and visit the  
 nearby homesteads to sell their wares.
  The diddie-coys have vehicles which  
 pull aluminium caravans with ornately 
 decorated interiors.They treat Appleby
 Fair as a holiday,spending the rest of
 their time in fixed locations.They are
 not true gipsy.Some tend to be untidy,
 thus upsetting the local residents.   </content>
