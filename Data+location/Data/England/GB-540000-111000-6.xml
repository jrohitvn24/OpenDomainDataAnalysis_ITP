		<title>06ST. PETER'S CHURCH HAMSEY</title>
		<content> The walls of this 800 year old        
{Norman church}are made of hard-wearing
 flint with an arched doorway made of  
 sandstone, while the roof is of tiles 
 and slate resembling the originals.   
 There is a large{bell tower}with      
 some windows bricked in. The gargoyles
 on each side were the first drain     
 pipe. The inside walls have been      
 plastered with a lime wash coating and
 decorated with 3 large family crests. 
{The chancel roof is now dangerous and 
 during high winds it vibrates causing 
 pieces of ceiling to fall.It{will cost
{Â£4,000 to repair.                     
 The church is used regularly for      
 worship once a month as well as being 
 a{local tourist attraction.}Recently  
 it has also been{used for concerts.   
 As it stands on a slight hill in the  
 middle of flat land the church is a   
 well-known and{popular landmark.      </content>
