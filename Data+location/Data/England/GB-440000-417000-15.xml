		<title>15HILL TOP FARM</title>
		<content>{Hill Top farm}is one of many farms    
 owned by{Nostell Estate.}The farm     
 consists of 162 acres of both pastoral
 and arable land. The farmer keeps 121 
 head of Fresian cattle which are only 
 used for milking. The farm buys cattle
 from markets all over the area as it  
 would be too expensive to breed their 
 own. The cows produce between 6100 and
 7500 litres of milk per year.         
   The fields that are not used for    
 pasture are used for suger beet,      
 potatoes and lay-grass. The farmer    
 sub-lets land to other farmers who    
 want to grow potatoes,wheat and peas. 
 The crops that he grows are mainly    
 used to feed his own cattle rather    
 than as a cash crop
