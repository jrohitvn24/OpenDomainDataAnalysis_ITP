 1821=781 people. 1831=892 people.     
 1841=921 people. 1851=900 people.

 1971=812 people. 1981=796 people.     
 The above population survey does not  
 include 1941 because it was the war.  
 It would be very hard to keep count   
 during the war years.                 
   Although the 1981 figures show a    
 decline in the population, there are  
 indications that numbers are rising   
 again.The village playgroup is more   
 full than it has been for some time   
 and there has been an increase in the 
 intake of new children at school this 
 year.
