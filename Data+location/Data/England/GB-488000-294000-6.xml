		<title>06THE HATTON ARMS, GRETTON</title>
		<content>The Hatton Arms is one of the oldest   
buildings in the village, and it got   
its name from the Lord of the Manor of 
Gretton at the time it was built in    
the late sixteenth century, Sir        
Christopher Hatton.  In 1672 the       
tenancy of the inn was reputedly given 
to a negro servant of Lord Hatton, by  
name of James Chappell as a reward for 
saving his master's life in a fire.    
James Chappell's death is recorded in  
the Parish Church in 1732.  The Hatton 
Arms was used as the Manor Court until 
1919, when a new system of land        
registration was brought in by         
Parliament.  Three crown stamps dated  
1117 can be found on the beam in the   
bar, the reason being that in 1117 the 
trees used for the beams in the inn    
were felled in the Crown Forest of     
Rockingham.
