		<content> This block has no centres of          
 population, but consists of scattered 
 small farms, in gently undulating     
 countryside.   The large proportion of
 the area is grass-keep, for cattle and
 sheep; though a certain amount of the 
 flatter land is cultivated.   Though  
 without villages or even hamlets, the 
 area has been long inhabited as the   
 iron-age fort at Bach-Camp testifies. 
 Even St Dubricius' church (built in   
 1910) at Hamnish Clifford was built   
 "in the middle of nowhere" to serve as
 a daughter church in the parish of    
 kimbolton.   The area contains two    
 fine country houses, Hennor and       
 Puddleston court, the latter now being
 used as a boarding school for         
 'special' children.
