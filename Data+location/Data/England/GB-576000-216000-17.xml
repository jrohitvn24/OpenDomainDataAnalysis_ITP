		<content>    This area is very much a farming   
 area and a lot of the land is given   
 over to the growing of crops. There   
 are many fields of wheat and barley   
 and also some of peas, potatoes and   
 beans. A few fields of oilseed rape   
 are grown too.                        
    One of the farms near where I live 
 has five tractors (they are Fords and 
 Massey Fergusons) and one combine     
 harvester.                            
    Towards Fairstead and Terling      
 especially there are a number of dairy
 herds and my uncle is Dairy manager at
 one of these farms.                   
    On the farm near my house they use 
 a lot of chemical sprays and          
 fertilisers and the farmer likes to   
 burn the stubble after harvest each   
 year.                                 
    Also in our area some willow trees 
 are grown to be used for cricket bats.</content>
