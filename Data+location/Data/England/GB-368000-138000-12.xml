 These are the views of Mrs. Cox       
 expressed during interview with her.  
                                       
{  Mrs. Cox}has always lived in        
 Batcombe.She has seen many{changes    
 and initially stated that she liked   
 none of them. She said, "give me the  
 good old days."                       
  She admitted that she preffered      
{electricity}to{oil}but she does cook  
 on the{Rayburn}sometimes.             
   She thought the{medical care}was    
 better when she was a child although  
 she almost died of{pneumonia.         
   She thinks it was better when the   
{general store, laundry}and{butcher    
 were around but she wished the        
{slaughter house}hadn't been built. She
 is{superstitious}and thinks the cows  
 from the slaughter house have{ghosts. </content>
