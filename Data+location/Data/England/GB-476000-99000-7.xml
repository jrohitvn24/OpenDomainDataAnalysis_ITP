		<title>07Housing in W.Itchenor</title>
		<content>  Among the older properties in        
 Itchenor are the fishermen's cottages 
 in The Street. A large number of      
 houses  were built in 1920 in varying 
 styles mainly for weekend yachtsmen,  
 but are now mostly permanently        
 occupied. Most of the houses are built
 along the main road but there are a   
 few side roads with small groups of   
 houses.                               
  The popularity of the area is        
 reflected in the price of properties  
 making them largely out of reach of   
 the younger age group. Most houses are
 owner occupied, some being secondary  
 or holiday homes.                     
  There is main water and electricity  
 and recently a new sewage system was  
 installed but no mains gas.           
  In the 1981 census there were 188 on 
 the electoral roll, mostly middleaged 
 or elderly people.                    </content>
