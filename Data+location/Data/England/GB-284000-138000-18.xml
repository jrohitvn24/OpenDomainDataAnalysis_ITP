		<content> The Smithy is situated almost opposite
 the hunt stables to which it is       
 closely associated. It has stood in   
 the village since 1930 and the Kents  
 have worked in the forge since the    
 17th Century. John Kent now works in  
 the forge with three other men,shoeing
 horses and carrying out general       
 ironmongery, for example repairs and  
 wrought iron work. There is also a    
 small Hardware shop next to the forge.
 On average between 30 and 40 horses   
 are shod each week. Many horses are   
 shod outside the forge within the     
 district,between 70 and 80 a week. The
 horse shoes come from Sheffield and   
 range from a heavy horse to a  donkey 
 size. The Smith is busy all year round
 and visitors are welcome to watch.
