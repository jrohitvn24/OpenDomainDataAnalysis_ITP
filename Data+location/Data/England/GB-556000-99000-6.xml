		<content> FAST FOOD IS ANOTHER WAY OF GETTING   
 READY COOKED FOOD QUICKLY.FAST FOOD   
 SHOPS ARE SIMILAR TO THE FISH AND CHIP
 SHOPS THAT WERE COMMON EARLIER IN THE 
 CENTURY AND STILL EXIST WHEN FISH AND 
 CHIPS WERE COOKED IN LARGE VATS OF    
 OIL.TODAY THEY SELL MEAT PIES,PORTIONS
 OF CHICKEN AND SAUSSAGES AS WELL AS   
 FISH.IN THESE SHOPS YOU GENERALLY HAVE
 TO WAIT WHILE THE FOOD IS COOKED FOR  
 YOU.A FAST FOOD SHOP WORKS MORE LIKE A
 FACTORY.IT PRODUCES LARGE QUANTITIES  
 OF CHIPS, BEEFBURGERS OR SIMILAR TYPES
 OF MEAT WHICH ARE SERVED TO YOU VERY  
 QUICKLY.YOU CAN EAT THEM IN THE SHOP  
 OR YOU CAN TAKE THEM AWAY. IN THE     
 SHOP, THE SEATING IS VERY CLINICAL SO 
 THAT IT IS USUALLY VERY CLEAN. THE    
 PLATES ARE MADE OF PAPER SO THAT      
 EVERYTHING IS THROWN AWAY. THERE IS NO
 WASHING UP TO DO.THEY ARE CHEAP.
