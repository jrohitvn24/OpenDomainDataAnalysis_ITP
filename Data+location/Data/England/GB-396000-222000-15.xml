		<title>15PRIORS HOUSING ESTATE</title>
		<content> FOUR CHILDREN FROM HOLY TRINITY SCHOOL
 WENT TO LOOK AT THE{PRIORS ROAD ESTATE
 WHICH WAS BUILT IN 1966. ON THE WAY WE
 STOPPED AT A{CORNER SHOP}AND TALKED TO
 THE LADY WHO RUNS IT. SHE TOLD US THAT
 MOST OF THE CUSTOMERS ARE SCHOOL      
 CHILDREN WITH ANYTHING FROM 5p TO Â£1  
 TO SPEND. THEY SOLD SWEETS, PAPERS,   
 EGGS, BREAD AND WERE REALLY A{SMALL   
{GROCERS SHOP.}WE WEREN'T ALLOWED TO   
 BUY ANY SWEETS IN SCHOOL TIME.        
 WE WALKED ALONG THE ROAD PAST THE BACK
 OF THE CEMETERY. THERE IS A{PARK}AND A
{PAVILION}THERE BY THE SIDE OF         
 G.C.H.Q. THERE IS A{BROOK}IN THE PARK 
 AND IT{FLOODS}WHENEVER THERE IS HEAVY 
 RAIN. THE PEOPLE ON THE ESTATE AND IN 
 WHADDON ARE FED UP WITH THE FLOODING. 
 ALL THE ROADS ON THE ESTATE ARE NAMED 
 AFTER{FAMOUS BATTLES.
