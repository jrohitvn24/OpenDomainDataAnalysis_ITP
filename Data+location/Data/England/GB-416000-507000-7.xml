		<content>  The{Youth Club}was{reorganised}at the
 beginning of {1984}after an{absence of
{more than 12 years.}  A grant from the
{Wm.Cockin Trust }helped  to  buy  some
{sports equipment}initially  and  since
 then events  have been  held  to  help
 funds.  The{  club  was  reformed}  in
{response  to  requests} from{teenagers
 who{ complained }at the total{ lack of
{facilities for their age group} within
 the village. This is an{area of social
{concern}  which   merits    far   more
 attention than it receives now  or has
 received  in  the  past.    There  are
 obvious  limits   such  as   cash  and
 'bricks &amp; mortar'  facilities  which a
 small rural population  can afford for
 such  a  worthwhile project  as  this.
 Local Govenment  does little to assist
 and    Central  Government    of   all
 political  persuasions  gives  nothing
 but platitudinous verbal comment!     </content>
