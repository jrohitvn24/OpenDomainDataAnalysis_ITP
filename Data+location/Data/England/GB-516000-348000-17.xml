		<content>  There are two places of worship, a   
 Church of England church and a        
 Wesleyan Chapel. Children of both     
 attend a Sunday School, held in the   
 Chapel every Sunday. There are people 
 of other faiths in the village; Roman 
 Catholics, Jehovah's Witnesses and    
 Spiritualists. They travel 9 miles to 
 Sleaford to worship. Church attendance
 has declined greatly in the past      
 years. The vicarage was sold and the  
 vicar now lives 6 miles away, having  
 7 parishes to attend to. It is        
 difficult for him to fit in services. 
 We have two each month at St. Mary's  
 Church, but the chapel is used every  
 Sunday. Harvest Festivals are held    
 yearly. Children have an anniversary  
 and sometimes a Christmas play.       
 Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve is held
 every 4th year. Charges: wedding-Â£44, 
 funeral_Â£36.                          </content>
