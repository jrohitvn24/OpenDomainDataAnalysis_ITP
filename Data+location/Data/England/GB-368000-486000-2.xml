		<title>02Farming In Dentdale.</title>
		<content>   There are milk farmers and suckler  
 farmers in Dentdale.Some farms have   
 camping and caravans,like Conder Farm 
 and High Laning,they both sell fresh  
 milk,yoghurt,eggs and cream.There are 
 a lot of old farms in Dentdale that   
 are empty now,these are sometimes     
 renovated to make holiday cottages,   
 others are left in ruins and the land 
 farmed by other local farmers.Farmers 
 allow holiday makers to watch them do 
 their work,some visitors even         
 volunteer to help, especially during  
 haytime.                              
    Sometimes barn rallies are held,at 
 Mill Beck Farm in 1985 some 200 people
 attended.Most farmers in the area try 
 to keep the traditional style of      
 farming,visiting Hawes or Sedbergh    
 for the Auction Markets,and doing all 
 they can to protect wild flowers,     
 birds and creatures great and small.  </content>
