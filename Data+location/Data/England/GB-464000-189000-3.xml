		<content> Ford's farm is an old property at     
 least 300 years old and still has some
 fine old farm buildings. The present  
 occupants mainly raise cattle and     
 sheep. Many of the lambs are born     
 during the winter months and graze in 
 the fields until they are old enough  
 to be transferred to another farm for 
 fattening.                            
 Similarly, the cattle are fed in the  
 fields but are not transferred. They  
 remain at Ford's Farm until they are  
 ready for slaughter as beef.          
 Crops raised at the farm include some 
 grain, and peas, the latter being used
 to prepare cattle feed. A recent      
 innovation at Fords Farm has been the 
 introduction of trout breeding The    
 fish are started off in the stream but
 are later brought into the farm       
 buildings where large tanks have been 
 installed.                            </content>
