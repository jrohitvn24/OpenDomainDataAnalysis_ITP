   The ground is gently undulating with
 the highest point approximately 350   
 ft. above sea level.                  
   There are many small streams feeding
 the River Lugg to the north and River 
 Arrow to the south.                   
   The Welsh border hills are visible  
 in the distance.                      
   In the north of the area there are  
 some typical Herefordshire lath and   
 plaster cottages, but in the south the
 new housing estates are red-brick     
 'boxes'.                              
   The only public house, near to both 
 housing estates, is an interesting,   
 part fifteenth century, black and     
 white timbered building, with modern  
 addition.                             
   In the hamlet of Cobnash there is a 
 disused water mill, which would have  
 been powered by Pinsley Brook.        </content>
