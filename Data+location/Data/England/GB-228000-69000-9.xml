		<content> In the Iron Age there were many       
 settlements in the Caradon Hill area. 
 The remains of{hut circles}can be seen
 on the moors. At Tokenbury the        
 Roundabury shows the place of an Iron 
 Age camp. A change in climate and loss
 of soil fertility made people move to 
 lower ground, leaving only a few metal
 workers behind. By Norman times{manor 
{houses}had been built at Penharget,   
 Bicton and Trebeigh, and later still  
 Slade and Tokenbury.                  
 The village of{Pensilva}did not appear
 until the middle of the 19th century. 
{Copper}was discovered in the area and 
 many mines started. In a few years as 
 many as 2,000 people were living here 
 and the same number in nearby Caradon 
 Town. At first the area was known as  
 Bodminland but later became{Pensilva  
{(Pen - headland, high ground and      
{silva - trees.)                       </content>
