		<title>15COTTAGE HOSPITAL PENRITH</title>
		<content> The Cottage Hospital was erected in   
 1898 and work finished in 1899.It was 
 built to commemorate the 60th year of 
 the reign of Queen Victoria.On the    
 20th July 1898 the foundation stone   
 was laid by Mr.R. Haywood-Thompson,   
 Chairman of the Eden Council          
 Committee.The hospital was opened on  
 November the 9th 1899 by the Lady     
 Brougham and Vaux.The hospital is     
 going to close because of the New     
 Hospital in Penrith,and it also costs 
 too much to run.Most of the nurses    
 will be going to the New              
 Hospital.There are 19 beds 6 of which 
 are geriatric,so they won't be        
 'dumped' anywhere.If they where born  
 in Penrith they will be transfered to 
 the New Hospital.If they were not     
 born in Penrith they will be taken to 
 another geriatric ward eleswhere.
