		<title>14Methodism - Tamar Valley</title>
		<content>        During the 19th  century miners
 came  to the  villages  and with  them
 brought   their   Methodism.  As   the
 various groups of Methodism each built
 their own chapels they  built three in
 Gunnislake,  one at St  Anne's  Chapel
 and two at  Albaston. The  miners were
 Cornishmen  who enjoyed singing and as
 there would  be a  congregation of two
 to  three  hundred  each   Sunday  the
 singing  must  have  been  marvellous.
       As  the  mines  closed  down the
 miners  moved and the chapels lost the
 congregations  they  had  had. Now  we
 only have two  chapels in the area one
 at  Gunnislake and one at Albaston and
 their  total  congregations  are about
 85.  There  is  a  Baptist  Chapel  at
 Metherell   and  the   Salvation  Army
 Church at Gunnislake has just closed.
