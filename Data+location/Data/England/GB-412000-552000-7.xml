 My brother was made redundant at Dean 
 Dove Factory this year.He has little  
 chance of getting another job as most 
 of the other factories in our area are
 also closing down.Being unemployed is 
 boring and depressing,he told me.He   
 has very little money to spend and he 
 fills his time in by going for long   
 walks and looking for a new job.      
                                       
{My dad was made redundant by a Tyre   
{Company this year.He decided to see   
{his Bank Manager to arrange a Loan.The
{Manager gave Dad the Loan and he went 
{and bought a Mercedes van so that he  
{could set up his own business as a    
{Tyre Dealer.At the moment my mam helps
{him to do the Bookeeping.My Dad likes 
{to work for himself because he says   
{there is much more satisfaction in it.</content>
