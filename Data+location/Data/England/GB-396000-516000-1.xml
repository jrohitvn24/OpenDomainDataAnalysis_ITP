		<title>01Cotherstone Moor</title>
		<content> A mile to the SW of Cotherstone the   
 moor rises gradually to the west,     
 broken by a number of steep gullies   
 with rock outcrops containing small   
 drainage streams flowing eastwards.   
 The area is covered with heather and  
 coarse grass with bracken in the      
 gullies. The sole habitation is Battle
 hill farm on the higher ground, and   
 here, together with some of the lower 
 slopes, the land is enclosed by dry   
 stone walls and gives rough grazing   
 for sheep and cattle. A minor road    
 crosses NS over the moor connecting   
 the villages of Bowes and Cotherstone.
 Clos to this on the west side is a    
 firing range stretching westwards     
 towards higher ground where there are 
 a few isolated small plantations of   
 mixed trees.Sheep roam at will over   
 unenclosed areas.                     
                                       </content>
