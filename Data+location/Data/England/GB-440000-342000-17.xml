		<content> Some of the Victorian farm buildings  
 have been restored and in one block   
 school parties can eat and sleep while
 they spend a week working with the    
 farm animals like milking cows,       
 feeding pigs and collecting eggs.     
 People can walk in the park to see the
 wildlife, we know that there are foxes
 roaming around in the countryside and 
 last year there were cubs. There is   
 also a cricket club in Shipley called 
 Shipley Hall, with a newish pavilon   
 including a bar. There is a restaurant
 as well as the Coppice Inn, for people
 to go and have a meal and drink. They 
 have outside seats, swings and slides 
 for children. There is a pond behind  
 it and if you are lucky in the evening
 you can see the fish jumping out of   
 the pond.
