 Behind Coronation Grove are some      
 garages and behind them is an old     
 railway bank.This railway used to     
 run to Kings Lynn and Dereham.In the  
 late 1960's it was torn up and the    
 platform and station left to decay.   
                                       
 At the moment there are a lot of      
 stinging nettles,bramble bushes and   
 trees.The council and Youth           
 Opportunity Scheme are cleaning it up 
 and trying to make it into a beautiful
 walkway for people and for walking    
 their dogs.                           
   Altogether its about a mile long and
 connects up with a caravan park which 
 is near to the A47 going to Kings     
 Lynn just outside Swaffham.
