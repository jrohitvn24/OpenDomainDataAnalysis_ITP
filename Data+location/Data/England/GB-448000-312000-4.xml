		<content> Copt Oak is the only hamlet at an     
 early road junction and meeting place 
 of 4 parishes.It has a church of local
 stone by Railton 1837,built after the 
 Enclosure Award 1829 which gave some  
 impetus to development in the district
 The oldest sites are monastic ones _  
 Ulverscroft Priory ruins dated 12th to
 15th C Listed Grade 1 &amp; Alderman's Haw
 W of Beacon Hill a 13th C site.Copt   
 Oak farmhouse and Poulteney Farm are  
 both of 18th C date and Listed Grade 2
 These with a further handful of farm  
 houses and their various cottages and 
 lodges have since been "gentrified".  
 Later houses were built after 1925    
 when the Bradgate Estate was sold and 
 again after 1945 until planning       
 policies restricted building in parts 
 of the Charnwood Forest.The total     
 number of houses in the area is less  
 than 70 and prices on resale are high.</content>
