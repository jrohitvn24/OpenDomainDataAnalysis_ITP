		<title>04CHENIES MANOR.</title>
		<content> Isenhampstead-Cheyne gradually became 
 known as Chenies.                     
 When Chenies Manor was built,it was   
 not thought that it would need any    
 fortifications,so there is no moat or 
 other defence systems. However there  
 are passages under the Manor House but
 these may have been for drainage.     
 Also,there is in the house, a priest  
 hole,which is unusual because the     
 family were Protestants,and would     
 therefore not have needed the use of a
 priest hole.The Manor House was built 
 of brick,in a Dieper pattern,and the  
 chimneys sculptured by a local        
 craftsman.These were greatly admired  
 by Henry VIII on a visit to           
 Chenies,and he had similar ones built 
 on Hampton Court.There is supposed to 
 be a ghost of Henry VIII,who had an   
 ulcerated leg,trying to climb the     
 stairs.                               </content>
