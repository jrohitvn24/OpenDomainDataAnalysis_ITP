		<content>{Population}-Since 1945 the population 
 has at least doubled.One inhabitant   
 who has lived in the village since    
 1898 recalled only 300 people living  
 in the vicinity.Now there are         
 approximately 1200.Mainly young       
{families}move into the area.There are 
 some old people and young parents and 
 children who occupy most of the newer 
 houses.There are few middle aged and  
 young people.                         
{Developments}-There used to be three  
 shops.Additionally there was a        
 blacksmith,candlemaker,herbalist,     
 saddler and a carpenter.Now only two  
 shops remain,and one is not always    
 open.The village hall,soon to be      
 rebuilt,was the old school.Now,the    
 school built in 1911 is to be closed  
 down to make way for the{modern}school
 currently being built.
