		<content>    Later it is used as a grain store  
 until the grain is sold.There are     
 still several old buildings,used for  
 storing implements and keeping a few  
 chickens etc. ,and some machinery     
 stands outside. The farm house itself 
 is 17th century -a fine building on a 
 lovely site.It has not been altered   
 structurally.The house is built of    
 sandstone with walls 2\ feet thick.   
   The farm is roughly half arable,    
 half grassland - some fields are      
 permanent pasture especially a few    
 near the valley which have very steep 
 slopes.The rotation is less strictly  
 followed than it used to be ,as heavy 
 and expensive dressings of artificial 
 fertilizers can maintain crop yields. 
 The main crops are grain (barley is   
 most important -but also some wheat   
 and oats),ley(rotational grass for hay
 and silage),turnips.                  </content>
