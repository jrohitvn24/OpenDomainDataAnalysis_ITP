		<content>   In this semi-rural area, industries 
 are sparse. There are no large        
 business premises. The majority of    
 the block is farmland. Businesses     
 employing most people are the         
 Abattoir, Woodyard and Industrial     
 Fasteners factory. Other businesses   
 are: petrol station with vehicle      
 repair facilities, two public houses, 
 car body repairs and crash specialist,
 dog kennels, driving school, welding  
 firm, builders merchants, several     
 farms, coach painters, car engineers, 
 building firm, stone mason, farm      
 butcher, hairdressers, plant hire     
 business, stables and a refuse dump.  
   Some private houses sell a variety  
 of items, e.g. hand-made wooden bird  
 tables, potatoes, plants, manure and  
 fresh foods. These could be called    
 "Cottage Industries".
