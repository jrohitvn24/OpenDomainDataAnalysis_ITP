		<title>18S.CROYDON _ ENVIRONMENT</title>
		<content> The area as a whole is well looked    
 after,having plenty of greenery       
 around.Even in the more built_up areas
 in the west of the Block there is     
 usually a view of some trees or grass 
 to be seen.                           
 The eastern parts often give the      
 impression of being in the open       
 countryside because there is so little
 built_up environment.                 
 Possibly because of the open spaces   
 and the hilly nature of the area ,and 
 because there is no part that has     
 really bad housing problems, there is 
 not too much evidence of environmental
 pollution.There are no major building 
 works which dominate the area, the    
 main form of building being           
 redevelopment on fairly small sites   
 where large,old houses have been      
 pulled down.
