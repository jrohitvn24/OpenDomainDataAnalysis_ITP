		<content>  The Priory Church                    
  The Church was built by William of   
 Edington, Bishop of Winchester, during
 the period 1352-61, on the site of an 
 earlier smaller place of worship.It   
 was originally part of the monastry of
 Bonhommes monks, who  led a life of   
 preaching in the area.As fish was     
 needed every Friday,they built a large
 lake, which is still there today.     
 During history, two stories have been 
 handed down.William Ayscough,Bishop of
 Salisbury,took sanctuary in the Church
 in 1450 but a mob from West Ashton    
 dragged him out and murdered him on   
 the hill.Lady Ann Beauchamp's husband 
 died in 1630 and as she worshipped in 
 the Church for over 30 years she had a
 monument erected in the building for  
 her husband and herself.The Church    
 holds 400 people and there have been  
 46 vicars since 1361.                 </content>
