		<content> We went into{Glynde Place.}The first  
 things we saw were two paintings.     
 The paintings were of Queen Charlotte 
 and George III. There was a shop in   
 Glynde Place.                         
 My favourite room was the{Upper Hall  
{and I saw a silver}figurine of Queen  
 Victoria on a silver tray. The silver 
 tray had men's heads engraved on it.  
 My second favourite room had{Welsh    
{costumes}in it. There was also a gold 
 christening gown.                     
 In the{library}there were some        
 window-panes with names scratched on  
 them with a diamond. On the landing we
 saw a portrait of the{Trevor family.  
{In the dining room}there was an oak   
 floor with a table with gold things on
 it.                                   
{ The Gateway}is a tower with a blue   
 dome and a ball on top.
