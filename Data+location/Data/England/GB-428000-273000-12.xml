		<content>The area of the estate is fairly big.  
There is a disused railway line at the 
back.There is a bottom level and a top 
level of factories.It is very clean and
quiet.The buildings range from 20-2    
years and there are different methods  
of construction. Several factories had 
a workforce of more than 20 but most   
were small units employing no more than
5 people.The buldings are arranged in  
an outer and an inner rectangle.It was 
interesting guessing the products from 
the factory signs.The products range   
from stationery to micro-meteorology.  
There is a dental laboratory. Most of  
the units were concerned with          
engineering. Only 1 unit of the 21 was 
empty. Outside Doleport Plastic Glazing
