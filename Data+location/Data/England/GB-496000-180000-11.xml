		<content>     430 pupils aged 12-18 in a co-ed  
 school were used as a sample          
 population.  They were asked about    
 their religions and their attitudes.  
 The following results were obtained:  
                                       
{Religious      216 }|{ Christian  96  
{Non-religious  183 }|{ Muslims    50  
{No answer       31 }|{ Hindus     28  
{                   }|{ Buddhists   8  
{                   }|{ Jews        1  
{                   }|{ Sikhs      33  
                                       
     Questions asked about abuse for   
 religious beliefs raised interesting  
 answers.  22% of students have known  
 some physical or verbal abuse.  The   
 feeling was that Christians did not   
 generally suffer abuse.  Sikhs felt   
 very harassed - mainly because of     
 recent events in India. Most abuse was
 aimed at appearance and food beliefs. </content>
