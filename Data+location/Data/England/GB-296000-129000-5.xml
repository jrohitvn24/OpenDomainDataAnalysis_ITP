		<title>05INTERVIEW  Holworthy Farm</title>
		<content> Between May 1st and October 29th the  
 farm offers a Bed and Breakfast       
 service for tourists. They come mainly
 from Wales but also from all over the 
 world for the summer trout fishing    
 season.                               
 When the reservoir was built in 1974  
 the farm lost land but was given      
 compensation. The farmer and his      
 family were not against it, for as    
 they said "it was better than a       
 motorway!".                           
 A tourist industry developed from it  
 and recreation is now available       
 through water sports. The water is not
 used by the farm for irrigation.
