		<content>  Cramlington has very good roads to   
 all the nearby towns. The Spine Road  
 (A189) to Newcastle passes through the
 town and the A1 trunk road is close   
 by. This is important for all the     
 factories on the Industrial Estates.  
                                       
   For long distance travellers,       
 Newcastle Airport can be reached by   
 car in less than half an hour and     
 there are trains to Newcastle and     
 beyond. There is even a London coach  
 service.                              
                                       
   There are very good bus services to 
 all the local towns. At busy times of 
 the day there are as many as six buses
 per hour to Newcastle, taking         
 different routes through the town.
