		<title>15LYDFORD C.P. SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Lydford School is 107 years old.There 
 are two classes,the infant class      
 containing 14 and the junior 16,making
 a total of 30,so our school is quite  
 small.                                
    We have a small garden but it is   
 going to be enlarged.The parents have 
 raised money to buy the garden and a  
 small swimming pool which is used in  
 the summer to teach the children to   
 swim.                                 
   At dinner time there is a canteen   
 and Mrs.Ferrier-Kerr cooks the food   
 for us. The infant teacher is called  
 Mrs Martyn and the teacher for the    
 older children is called Mr Tremain.  
   Sometimes we go to a school called  
 Lewtrenchard or they come here.We play
 soft ball cricket,rounders,football   
 and net ball.We also go to Bridestowe 
 for singing and music.Last week we had
 a concert with the other two schools. </content>
