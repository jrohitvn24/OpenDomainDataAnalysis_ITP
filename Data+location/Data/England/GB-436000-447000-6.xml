		<title>06WETHERBY ART'S FESTIVAL</title>
		<content>  Wetherby Art's Festival was founded  
 in 1977 when a group of people at a   
 party decided to bring music, drama   
 and art together as a festival. There 
 is an organizing committee of 12 who  
 decide which shows to have. They pick 
 the amateurs first and then they fill 
 the gaps with professionals. There    
 used to be 18 months between festivals
 but now it is two years as that is    
 better for organizing purposes. The   
 committee start their planning a year 
 before the festival date. In 1979 all 
 the schools in the area took part, but
 they no longer do so, although local  
 art's groups still participate. There 
 are special events for children during
 the day. The main events are usually  
 held at Wetherby High School. The     
 Festival is not a fund raising event. 
 Any profits go into the bank to be    
 used for the next Festival.           </content>
