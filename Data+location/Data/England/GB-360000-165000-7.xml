		<title>07Whitchurch Village School</title>
		<content> Whitchurch County Primary school is   
 situated on the main A39 Wells Road   
 about 4 miles from the centre of      
 Bristol. It was opened in 1911 as a   
 small village school. The early school
 log book tells for instance of the    
 many absences from the school         
 particularly at Harvest time and of   
 how the schoolchildren entertained the
 local wounded troops from the Great   
 War 1914-1918.In the 1930's extra     
 classrooms and a large hall was built 
 on to the existing stone building to  
 cater for the growing local           
 population.In 1944 the children on    
 roll was 207 and in 1984 214.Until    
 1974 the school was maintained by     
 Somerset County Council and now by    
 Avon Education Authority.
