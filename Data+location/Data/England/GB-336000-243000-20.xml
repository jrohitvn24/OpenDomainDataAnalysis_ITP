		<content> STAUNTON ON WYE PEOPLE IN THE AREA    
 The population of Staunton and the    
 surrounding area is an ageing one,    
 and this tendency is becoming more    
 marked as more people retire here and 
 as the young move away in pursuit of  
 jobs or houses. Some houses are also  
 let as holiday homes with an adverse  
 effect on local life. Many new people 
 have moved into the area over the last
 few years and the number of native    
 inhabitants is falling. The social    
 structure of the area is very mixed,  
 with a wide variety of occupations -  
 farmers, factory workers, office &amp;    
 shop staff and even a professional    
 violinist. It is a close and caring   
 community where people look after each
 other and good neighbourliness is     
 prized and encouraged.
