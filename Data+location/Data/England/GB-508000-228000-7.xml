		<title>07Living in Hexton Village</title>
		<content>{106}people including 16 children live 
 in{Hexton Village.}The longest time   
 someone has lived in Hexton is 85     
 years. 23 residents work in the       
 village, mostly on the Manor Farm or  
 Estate, and 20 people go to work      
 elsewhere. A wine merchant is         
 converting a barn to store stock,     
 there is a warehouse for china goods  
  and an antique repairs business.The  
 only other work is running{The Raven,}
 and the{Post Office}which also sells  
 sweets and ice creams.In most gardens 
 residents grow vegetables and flowers.
 People choose to live here because it 
 is{quiet and peaceful}and the country_
 side is so beautiful. One drawback is 
 the lack of{public transport.}There is
 a daily bus{to Luton}and one on market
 day, Tuesday, to Hitchin. Most house_ 
 holds own a car and use it to shop in 
 the nearby towns of Hitchin and Luton.</content>
