		<title>06SHOPPING IN BISHOP MIDDLEHAM</title>
		<content> There are not many shops in the area  
 and those that are tend to be very    
 small. In the village the Post Office 
 is predominant in its use by the      
 villagers. The Post Office also sells 
 groceries, fruit and sweets as well as
 cards for varying occasions.          
                                       
 There is also a Newsagents and a      
 Butchers. The local milkman also sells
 milk from his own house.              
                                       
 Villagers tend to do the bulk of their
 shopping in the larger stores to be   
 found in the nearby towns and cities, 
 using the local shops for items they  
 run out of or have forgotten.
