		<title>12EVENTS IN SALISBURY IN 1985</title>
		<content> The Princess of Wales opened a new    
 ward at Odstock Hospital.             
 Industry was boosted with the         
 developement of the Optica aircraft,  
 very suitable for aerial observation  
 and photography. There was argument   
 when an oil company planned to drill  
 in the water meadows near the         
 cathedral. Many people were worried   
 that if oil were found the beautiful  
 views of the cathedral would vanish.  
 The other controversy was after the   
 County Council elections resulted in  
 gains for the S.D.P.-Liberal Alliance 
 because reorganisation of secondary   
 education in Salisbury was to be      
 discussed again.                      
 A new shopping centre on the Maltings 
 with the refurbishment of the City    
 Hall has caused building activity and 
 traffic confusion but should give     
 future benefit to the community.      </content>
