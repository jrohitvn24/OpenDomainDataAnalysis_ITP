		<title>02The Garden Centre.</title>
		<content>   In Richmond we have an old railway  
 station down by the river.There are   
 the old engine sheds and the old      
 stationmaster's house.The track has   
 gone and the station is now a garden  
 centre.The line used to join the LNER 
 main line at Darlington.In the sixties
 the railway was closed and the station
 became a garden centre without any    
 alterations to the outside of the     
 building except for blocking off the  
 end of the platform to enclose the    
 space.The centre now supplies         
 materials and equipment for           
 farmers,builders and gardeners.       
   There is now a modern swimming pool 
 in the old goods yard opposite the    
 garden centre.The old stationmaster's 
 house is now the manager's house.
