		<title>20Ashford Cattle Market</title>
		<content>With access onto the Ring Road of      
Ashford stands an area used often as a 
cattle market. Local farmers and       
dealers bring their animals here to be 
sold by auction. Cattle, sheep and     
other farm animals are dealt with here.
Many farmers and butchers bid secretly 
for groups of animals when they come up
for sale. Once a year there is a Show  
when prizes are awarded for the best   
live specimens. Dead meat is on display
and prizes are given for the best      
quality.                               
The same site is used for car auctions.
Anyone with a car to sell can ask to   
bring it there. The owners state a     
price that they would like.   The      
auctioneer allows people to bid for    
each car as it is driven in.
