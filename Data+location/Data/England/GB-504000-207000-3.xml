    Up the shops in Grovehill there is 
 a shop called Martins. I meet my      
 friends there before I go to the{youth
{club.}I feel safe there because there 
 are lots of other people. They're     
 young and old. I feel free there      
 because no one owns me up there, I can
 do as I like.                         
    There's always a group of boys     
 outside the chippy. Some of them go   
 whizzing about on{skateboards}only    
 just missing people. So I walk through
 the car park and through a hole in the
 fence to the{video shop.}I haven't got
 a video but I go there anyway to look 
 at the video covers and watch the     
 televisions there and then look at the
 video rental prices and go on to the  
 youth club.                           
                                       
                                       </content>
