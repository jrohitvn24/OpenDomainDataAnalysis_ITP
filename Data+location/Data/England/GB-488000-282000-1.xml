		<content>Geddington is an active village of     
about 1,300 people, 4 miles northeast  
of Kettering on the A43. It has 7      
shops, a recreation field, 3 pubs, 39  
clubs and a Primary School. It has some
industrial premises and several farms. 
There is a Village Hall which overlooks
tennis courts and the recreation field,
bordering the river. In Queen Street   
there is a Chapel built in 1875. A     
Medieval bridge spans the River Ise.   
In the centre of the village stands    
Queen Eleanor's Cross, built in 1294 by
Edward I to mark the resting place of  
the body of his wife on the journey    
from Harby to London.                  
West of the school is the Church of    
Mary Magdalene.                        
Most of the houses around the centre of
the village are made of limestone.
