		<title>01A QUIET RURAL AREA</title>
		<content> A pleasant area in which to live or   
 work, comprising the village of       
 Souldrop and surrounding farmland. The
 local people believe it is a{healthy  
 place to live, as expressed in the    
 saying:                               
 'Souldrop air and Sharnbrook water,   
 make a man live here and hereafter.'  
                                       
 The area has been greatly affected    
 over the years by its proximity to    
 Colworth House, a former{stately home 
 and now a major food research         
 establishment.                        
                                       
 As soon as you get away from the main 
 Rushden to Bedford road the tranquilty
 of the area is broken only by the     
 occasional rumble of passing{trains   
 and less frequently by low flying     
 aircraft.}                            
                                       </content>
