		<title>12HIGHCLIFFE POLICE STATION</title>
		<content>    At Highcliffe police station there 
 is one police officer on the beat all 
 the time with support from other      
 specialist departments. One policeman 
 is on duty riding a bicycle and he    
 works discretionary duties. A total   
 of five policemen drive the police car
 in Highcliffe but only one is on duty 
 at any one time. It opens daily from  
 9 a.m. to 10.30 a.m. and again each   
 evening from 6 p.m. to 7.30 p.m. Five 
 police officers are stationed at      
 Highcliffe and these are all men. The 
 notices displayed are mainly missing  
 persons, wanted persons and general   
 information posters. In this area     
 policemen must be at least 5 feet 8   
 inches &lt;170 cm> tall and police women 
 5 feet 4 inches &lt;160 cm>. The police  
 station in Highcliffe was built in    
 1969. My dad is a policeman.
