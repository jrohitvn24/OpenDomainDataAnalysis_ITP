		<content> Most people visit local areas of      
 interest of which there are many. The 
 visits usually take the form of family
 outings at the weekends mostly.       
   Some team games are played but      
 recreational facilities are few. Most 
 people take advantage of the          
 countryside and the view around them  
 and pastimes such as walking, fishing 
 and gardening are very popular.       
   Many village interests still carry  
 on. People visit their friends        
 frequently and together they go to    
 local functions. Bell ringing is still
 popular in the village.               
   Villagers organise fund raising     
 activities in their spare time and    
 sell things they have made.           
   The older generation, through the   
 Mothers' Union, often meet and        
 organise outings.
