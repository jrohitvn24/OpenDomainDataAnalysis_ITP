		<content> The Linny family live on a farm of 76 
 acres at{Cardinham.}Both parents are  
 Cornish and have lived on this farm   
 for most of their lives. They practice
{mixed farming,}a mixture of livestock 
 and cereal. His livestock consists of 
 60 sheep, 13 young horses, 6 cows, 26 
 store bullocks and five calves. Beef  
 does not give him a good return on    
 investment.  He also has 15 chickens  
 and 10 ducks. Ten acres are used for  
 corn, and he also grows his own hay   
 -400 bales.                           
 Although contented they find farming  
 hard work; most of the time it is a   
 12 hour day.  Given the choice again  
 they would not farm for there are many
 ties,{little money}to be made and     
 hardly any opportunity for            
 socialising.
