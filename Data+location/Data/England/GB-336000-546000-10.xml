		<title>10FARM DIARY: ACCIDENT &amp; DEATH</title>
		<content> 13 February.                          
   Mum and I called at the vet's to    
 collect a drench for a ewe with       
 suspected twin lamb disease. A        
 Charolais heifer somehow got itself   
 upturned in one of the side troughs in
 the silage yard so Dad and I lifted it
 out by tying some rope to its front   
 legs and tying the other end of the   
 rope to the loader on the tractor. We 
 then lifted the loader up and the     
 heifer came out slowly. When the      
 heifer stood up we noticed she had    
 one of her horns knocked off, so we   
 put her in a shed by herself          
 overnight.                            
 14 February                           
   The ewe with the twin lamb disease  
 died this morning. Another of our     
 Ayrshire cows calved. It had a        
 Simmental bull calf.
