		<title>01Area Summary</title>
		<content>  Ours is a rural area. It consists    
 almost entirely of farmland and       
 includes the two small villages of    
 Ladock and Grampound Road. The        
 population is approximately 650.      
  The area lies midway between Plymouth
 and Land's End and is approximately 11
 miles from the North and South coasts.
 Ladock is 2 miles North West of       
 Grampound Road on the main A39 road.  
 About a mile South of Grampound Road  
 runs the A390 road.                   
  The mainline Railway track runs      
 through our area from the North East  
 corner through Grampound Road and down
 to the South West corner where it     
 crosses the A39 road.The nearest main 
 towns and stations are at Truro and   
 St.Austell which are 6 and 9 miles    
 respectively, away from Ladock.       
  A river flows from North to South    
 passing through Ladock and to the Fal.</content>
