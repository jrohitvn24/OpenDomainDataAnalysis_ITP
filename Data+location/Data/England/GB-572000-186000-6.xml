		<content> Danielle Wilson answered the phone and
 said" Pitsea School. Can I help you?" 
 The voice said,"There's a bomb in the 
 school. You've got 20 minutes to get  
 out".Danielle ran to tell her mum,who 
 told Mrs North.The children all ran   
 onto the field and stood there while  
 the Police checked the school.There   
 was no bomb!                          
 A thanks giving service was held at   
 our school for Mr.D.Williams who      
 had died of pneumonia. He was head of 
 the Chess Club at Pitsea Junior School
 and had taught at the  school for     
 27 years and retired  a year ago.A    
 tree is going to be planted in        
 memory of him.                        
 Basildon Council are going to have  a 
 talk about St.Michael's church,Pitsea.
 It is no longer used and the          
 Council are planning to turn it into a
 museum.      Sarah French.            </content>
