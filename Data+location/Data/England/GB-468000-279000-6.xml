		<title>06MASTER THATCHER</title>
		<content> There are several thatched cottages   
in Clipston. Mr Davis learned to thatch
in 1950, at Wellingborough. He stayed  
there 4 years. To become a Master      
Thatcher his work was checked by       
officials over a period of 12 months.  
 At present he is working on Mrs Bevis 
White's house in Clipston. It will take
12 months to finish. The roof needs    
3200 bundles. There are 55 bundles to a
fathom, which is 6ft. in diameter.     
 The water reed grows in Norfolk, and  
can grow up to 8ft. tall. It goes      
yellow in September and is cut between 
March and December.                    
 Hazel sticks are used because they do 
not break easily. Leggets drive the    
reed upwards. Needles hold the thatch  
in place, long knives cut the sedge.   
 The advantage of thatch is that it    
keeps a house warmer than a tiled roof.
