		<title>13BEE KEEPING IN SHILLINGSTONE</title>
		<content> Bee keeping must have been practised  
 in Shillingstone since the time of the
 Eschelling family at least. The number
 of orchards in the past and the       
 lush natural flora has made these     
 riverside pastures a rich source of   
 nectar.                               
 There are two apiarists in            
 Shillingstone. Cecil Trent and his    
 sons have a number of colonies at the 
 southern end of the village and Clive 
 Edwards, a beekeeper for 20 years, has
 hives on apple blossom, lime blossom, 
 chalk flora and bluebell woods. He    
 also imports lavender honey from      
 Provence. Modern agriculture and the  
 grubbing out of the old cider orchards
 has greatly depleted the nectar.      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
