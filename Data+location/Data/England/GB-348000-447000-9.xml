 One farmer's report for 1985.         
 We had 60 Friesian cows milking twice 
 daily. We were over-cautious and did  
 not produce to full potential so were 
 5000 litres under quota in March.     
 Over-quota now but may avoid levy.    
 20 Friesian bullocks and 19 Aberdeen  
 Angus cross-bred beef calves to       
 improve income. Instead of barley we  
 sowed 10 acres of Protein peas for    
 stock feed but they were totally lost 
 because of heavy rain. 100 acres of   
 silo was cut twice but very late and  
 we had no weather fit for hay to feed 
 calves. Beef animals have done well   
 but wonder whether to sell now at Â£300
 or over-winter and hope for Â£475 in   
 spring.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
