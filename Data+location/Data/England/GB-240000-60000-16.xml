		<content> My name is Claire and I am 11 years   
 old. My favourite T.V. serial is      
 called Dallas. It is about a modern   
 rich oil family in Dallas, Texas. I   
 like it because sometimes it is       
 exciting and sometimes sad. Each      
 weekly episode leaves you in suspense 
 wondering what will happen next. This 
 is frustrating and yet part of its    
 attraction.                           
 My name is Oliver, I am 11 years old. 
 My favourite weekly serial is called  
 The 'A' Team. It is about 4 men in    
 America who have escaped from a U.S.  
 Army prison, and spend their time     
 fighting evil and corruption.         
 My name is Sarah and I am 11 years    
 old. My favourite serial 'Coronation  
 Street' is the longest running prog-  
 ramme in Britain.It is all about life 
 among working class people in a       
 Lancashire town.                      </content>
