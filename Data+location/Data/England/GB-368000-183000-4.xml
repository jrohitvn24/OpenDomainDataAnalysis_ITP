		<title>04A GRANDMOTHER'S MORNING</title>
		<content> Our day starts a 7.15am when we are   
 awakened by the clock radio alarm,    
 electric with battery back up,        
 in case of power cuts during the      
 night. While my husband showers and   
 prepares for work I make the tea with 
 tea bags, much cleaner then the tea   
 leaves.After my husband has left for  
 work I shower and dress.I sort the    
 laundry and put it in the automatic   
 washing machine,select the programme  
 and the machine will do the rest.I    
 decide what to cook for our evening   
 meal, and take the meat out of the    
 freezer to thaw out.Vacuuming the     
 carpets comes next.Dusting is the same
 old monotonous job; so is cleaning    
 the bathroom.11am :time to take my    
 turn on the meals-on-wheels rota.Two  
 people collect the dinners in a large 
 charcoal heated container,and deliver 
 them to the elderly people.           </content>
