		<title>08Wimbledon Common (1)</title>
		<content>In 1871 the Wimbledon Common Act made  
the area a public open space, a wide   
expance of open, uncultivated land.This
includes Putney Heath. At Tibbet's     
Corner Underpass a sign of a highwayman
commemorates past scenes of robbing    
here.The Telegraph pub takes its name  
from an Admiralty Telegraph Station    
there in 1796 (during the Napoleonic   
Wars) for semaphore signalling between 
Portsmouth and Whitehall.              
Commander Peter Dean is Clerk and      
Ranger to the Putney and Wimbledon     
Common Conservators. This group of 8   
rate-payers, who live near the Common, 
5 of whom are elected every 3 years and
3 people appointed by the Government,  
are in charge of this unique Common. It
is financed by a yearly rate levied on 
all householders living within a       
certain distance of the Common. Policy 
is decided at monthly meetings.(cont-) </content>
