		<content> St. Cuthbert's is part of a united    
 benefice working under one vicar but  
 with some services taken by lay people
 The Church frequently hosts musical   
 concerts with artists from the        
 Northern Sinfonia and are always well 
 attended. At least one service is held
 each Sunday and the congregation      
 averages 25, a high proportion of the 
 population. The Alternative Service   
 book has been introduced alongside the
 Book of Common Prayer to cater for    
 different tastes. Services at         
 Christmas,Easter and Harvest have high
 attendances which are growing each    
 year.All babies born here are baptised
 The first confirmation for six years  
 takes place this year. All young folk 
 getting married still choose a church 
 wedding. Over 90% of people who die   
 are buried in the churchyard, few     
  being cremated.                      </content>
