		<content> There is a wide variety of houses in  
 Souldrop village, from the{half-      
{timbered buildings}such as Lamb's     
 Cottage and Church Farm through       
 to post-war bungalows and houses.     
                                       
 Although many of the older properties 
 would have been thatched originally,  
 all the houses now have{slate or tile 
 roofs.                                
 The smaller farm workers'{cottages    
 still had bare brick walls and a range
 fitted in the front room for cooking  
 when some of the present occupants    
 moved in and until two years ago they 
 used chemical toilets - a tanker      
 called each week to empty them!       
                                       
 One of the biggest recent developments
 was the row of eight{council houses   
 built in the late 1950's by the then  
 Bedford Rural District Council.       </content>
