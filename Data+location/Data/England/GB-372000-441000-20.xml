		<title>20CLITHEROE'S CLIMATIC SAYINGS</title>
		<content>    The damp climate of Clitheroe was  
 an important factor in establishing   
 the cotton industry of the town. Even 
 today old sayings about the weather   
 are still to be heard. Most of these  
 make reference to Pendle Hill which   
 can be seen to the east of the town.  
    "When Pendle wears its woolly cap, 
     Farmers all must take a nap."     
                                       
    "When Pendle Hill doth wear a hood,
     Be sure, the day will not be      
     good."                            
                                       
    "If you can't see Pendle, it's     
     raining,                          
     If you can see Pendle, it's going 
     to rain."                         
    Times have not changed. June of    
 this year has been cool and cloudy,   
 with rain and showers occurring on    
 about half the days.                  </content>
