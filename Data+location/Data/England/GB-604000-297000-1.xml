		<content>  The village of Morley is made up of  
 the parishes of Morley St.Peter and   
 Morley St.Botolph. It is on the main  
 road from Norwich to London and is    
 midway between the towns of Wymondham 
 (pronounced Wind-ham) and             
 Attleborough. Most of the land in the 
 area is used for farming,             
 predominantly arable. The main        
 employers in the village are the      
 Norfolk Agricultural station and      
 Wymondham College, although many      
 villagers work in Wymondham or        
 Norwich. A few villagers are self     
 employed in trades such as building,  
 and there is a sawmill in the village 
 and one village shop/post office.
