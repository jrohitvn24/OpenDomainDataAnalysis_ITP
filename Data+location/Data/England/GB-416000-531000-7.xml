		<content> Our rural D-block is made up of four  
 small villages.There is a primary     
 school in both{Howden}and{Hunwick}but}
 young children from North Bitchburn   
 and High Grange have to travel to     
 Howden two miles by bus.As there are  
 no Comprehensive schools in our block,
  after leaving primary school children
 have to travel to near-by towns.They  
 once could only go to{Parkside        
{Comprehensive}which is a split site   
 comprehensive.The children go  to     
{Parkside-Crook}premises for their 1st 
 &amp;2nd years{Parkside-Willington}for    
 3rd,4th&amp;5th years and if they want to 
 go on to Sixth Form they have to go to
{Wolsingham.}Some parents don't like   
 this so they send their children to   
{Bishop Barrington Comprehensive}or    
{King James VI Comprehensive,}both in  
 Bishop Auckland but they have to pay  
 their own bus fares.                  </content>
