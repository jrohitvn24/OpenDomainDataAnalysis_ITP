		<content>    The houses in the village are      
 mainly cottages of various sizes,plus 
 a small council estate.There are a    
 number of listed buildings which have 
 been renovated and kept in character. 
 Buildings such as the old post        
 office,the old chapel and the vicarage
 are all privately owned.As some of the
 farms have been lost to active        
 farming,the farmhouses have been      
 converted  into luxury homes,with     
 the land being used as paddocks.This  
 is particularly true of the eastern   
 side of the area.Farm cottages have   
 been sold off and have been converted 
 to week_end cottages.                 
    This is a quiet rural area set in  
 attractive surroundings,with easy     
 access to London,which provides a     
 constant demand for week_end and      
 holiday accomodation.
