		<content>       MODEL FARM                      
 The Farm is 120 years old with the    
 house being older than the farm.There 
 are 103 acres of barley, wheat, peas  
 and grass.There are 50 beef cattle    
 which are fattened up then sold. Five 
 workers are needed. The farmer has    
 worked for 44 years. He gets up at    
 7am and works about 9 hours a day.The 
 work is tiring but enjoyable.The      
 first job is to feed the cattle.      
 Cattle are bought and sold at the     
 cattle market. Some have caught T.B.  
 There are always repairs being done on
 the farm. The barn was once set on    
 fire 20 years ago and some motor bike 
 boys have caused damage in the fields.
 The workshop was once burgled.        
 Wildlife seen around the farm are     
 foxes, hawks and owls. Rats are a     
 problem.
