		<content>       364 pupils aged between 4 and 11
 were interviewed. Several old         
 favourites were still very popular.   
 Football was the most popular (68     
 children) followed by skipping (37    
 children) and Tig (31 children). The  
 remaining votes were divided between a
 number of more obscure games with     
 about 2 or 3 children voting for each 
 eg Kiss Chase. Other games including  
 "Army, Tanks, Trains and Hopscotch".  
 Several children played a "risque"    
 skipping game called Cinderella, which
 has the following words:"Cinderella,  
 Dressed in yella, Went downstairs, To 
 meet a fella, On her way, Her panties 
 busted, How many people, Were         
 disgusted?". The rope is turned and   
 one child skips throughout the ryhme  
 while the others skip in and out      
 singly counting in 5's. When the rope 
 stops, the game restarts.             </content>
