		<title>01A GENERAL VIEW OF THE BLOCK</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
 The block consists mainly of          
 agricultral land. There are several   
 large farms in the area. These farms  
 are mostly dealing in grazing for     
 sheep and cattle with some crops.     
                                       
 The only built up area in the block   
 is the village of Feckenham which is  
 mentioned in the original Domesday    
 Book.                                 
                                       
   There is also a large Electricity   
 Sub Station in the block.             
                                       
   There are only two "B" roads in the 
 area and several lanes. Some of the   
 area is not accessible by road.       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
