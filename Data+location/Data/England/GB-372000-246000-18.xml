		<content>{THE NEW INN}On the road above Kings   
 Bridge is a house that used to be an  
 inn.25 years ago it was called the New
 Inn.The front of the house is         
 Georgian,the back is black and white. 
 A married couple ran the inn for the  
 brewery.The name of the inn was       
 changed to "The Stable" and a new inn 
 sign hung up.Later the brewery decided
 to close the inn.The house was sold   
 and it is a private house today.      
{BROOKSIDE}This was the first          
 development after the water supply and
 the sewage system were put in.The     
 field was used for cows to graze in   
 and later was sold to a builder       
 who sold it as a building plot.8      
 bungalows were built.20 foot trees    
 were put in (Weeping Willow,Horse     
 Chestnut,Conifers and Oaks).
