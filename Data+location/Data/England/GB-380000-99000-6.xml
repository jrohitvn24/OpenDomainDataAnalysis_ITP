 The School's catchment area includes  
 all habitations within the parish of  
 Whitechurch including Chescombe,      
 Whatcombe, Thornicombe, Manor Farm and
 Birch Close. Free transport is        
 available to and from Thornicombe,    
 Manor Farm and Birch Close. Children  
 are required by law to begin school at
 the beginning of the school term after
 their fifth birthday but they are     
 accepted for part-time schooling in   
 the previous term. Twenty-one children
 attend the School housed in two       
 classes - one for children aged 4+ to 
 7 and the Junior class for children   
 aged 7+ to 9 years old. Children      
 transfer to the Middle School at

 the academic year (September)         
 following their ninth birthday.
