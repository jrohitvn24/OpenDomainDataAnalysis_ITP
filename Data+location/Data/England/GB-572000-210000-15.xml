		<content> A Day in the life of Ann continued.   
 Basildon is a mostly working class    
 area, so Ann and her mother in law    
 need to provide good quality low      
 priced food.                          
 Ann buys her lunch from a market stall
 and it will consist of egg or cheese  
 on toast.                             
 Ann leaves the stall at 5.30 and      
 catches 2 buses back to Boreham.She   
 enjoys half a pint of shandy at the   
 local pub while waiting for her       
 husband to give her a lift for the    
 last part of the journey.             
 Ann cooks dinner when she arives home.
 This might be a vegetable flan with a 
 mixed salad.Ann likes salads with a   
 rice base,and may include nuts and    
 raisons.Ann and her family do not eat 
 meat.After dinner Ann may play with   
 her children chess, badminton computor
 games, or take them swimming.         </content>
