 There are no privately owned schools  
 in this area of Derby. One infant and 
 junior school is Roman Catholic.      
 All the schools have hard play areas  
 and recreation fields for games. They 
 all have hot meals cooked on the      
 premises.(45p in 1985) Most needed    
 additional temporary classrooms during
 the 1960s and 1970s. However, with the
 falling rolls of the early 1980s, many
 are now resource centres, libraries,  
 art or drama rooms.                   </content>
