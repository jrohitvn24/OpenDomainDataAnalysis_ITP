 The Police House was reopened on 22nd 
 July 1985 by Cheshire County Council  
 after pressure was brought to bear by 
 Chelford P.C.C. It is manned by P.C.  
 Gummer, a mechanised beat officer, who
 drives a van. There are five such as  
 he in the area. They work each others 
 beats as well as their own. Crime is  
 low in Chelford. It has the lowest    
 burglary rate of the Mcclsfld area.
