		<title>15HOUSING IN CREWE</title>
		<content> In Crewe many of the houses were built
 in the 1800's and most of them are    
 terraced, made from red brick and have
 slate roofs. Many of the slate roofs  
 have now been replaced by tiles.      
                                       
    The first houses built in Crewe    
 were originally built by the railway  
 company in the 1840's. These houses   
 are in Tollit Street and Gaffer's row.
 They were bought and restored by the  
 council in 1979 and then sold. Crewe  
 has many cottage-type houses with two 
 up and two down.                      
                                       
     Along Nantwich Road there are     
 large terraced houses and then modern 
 semi-detached and detached houses.
