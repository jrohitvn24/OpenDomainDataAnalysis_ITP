		<content> Dunham Park expands over 250          
 acres.There are many sights in the    
 park,including the hall,2000 trees    
 have been planted.The dead ones have  
 been cut up to use as a protective    
 fence around the new saplings.Some of 
 the elm trees had to be cut           
 down,because they had been attacked by
 'Dutch Elm Disease'.Amongst variety of
 trees are the Alder,Elm,Oak and       
 Birch.About 200 deer roam freely,and  
 at night they shelter in the deer     
 barn.A small area of the park is      
 fenced over.This is called the deer   
 sanctuary.It is a place where no      
 member of the public may enter.This is
 where the deer can have some          
 rest.There are now 200 deer.There is a
 slaughter house where the deer are    
 shot when they are too old or when    
 they become savage.
