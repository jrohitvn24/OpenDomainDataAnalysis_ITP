		<title>07A walk near Holbeach Hurn.</title>
		<content> One Monday afternoon when the sun was 
 shining we decided to go for a walk to
 look at what was growing in the fields
 and hedgerows.To get to the edge of   
 our block we had to walk about a mile 
 up the road.When we got there we could
 see that most of the fields had       
 vegetable crops in them. In other     
 parts of the block it was either      
 cereal or flowers.We looked at        
 wild flowers and saw dandelion,field  
 poppy,buttercup,comfrey,cow           
 parsley (known here as kek),white dead
 nettle,stinging                       
 nettle,clover,agrimony,groundsel and  
 wild chamomile.We also saw and        
 identified 13 types of grass.There    
 were more that we could not           
 identify.We saw quite a few           
 butterflies.Philip identified the     
 common British Blue and a Skipper.
