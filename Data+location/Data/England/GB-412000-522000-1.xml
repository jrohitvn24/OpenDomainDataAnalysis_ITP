		<title>01Introducing Area 0412 0522</title>
		<content> Our area is a very rural part of Co.  
 Durham with two small areas of        
 population namely the village of      
 Cockfield to the N.W. and part of     
 Evenwood to the N.E. plus a few       
 inhabitants in the hamlets of         
 Wackerfield, Burnt Houses and         
 Esperley.It is an undulating area, the
 highest point being 220 m. above sea  
 level.The nearest towns are Darlington
 13 miles away to the S.E. Bishop      
 Auckland 7 miles away to the E. and   
 Barnard Castle 6 miles to the S.W. .  
  1985 sees the area dominated by      
 opencast mining on the site of the now
 empty Buckhead farm.The area's other  
 principal feature is The Fell, but it 
 also contains many farms,2 of which   
 are featured on later pages.There are 
 3 small factories,most employment is  
 found out of the area and there is    
 much unemployment among the young.    </content>
