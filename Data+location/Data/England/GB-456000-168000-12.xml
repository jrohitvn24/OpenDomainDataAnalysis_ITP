		<title>12BRADFIELD BUSHNELLS GREEN</title>
		<content> Bushnells Green bordering Bradfield   
 is rough grazing land with pheasant   
 shoots.There are two farms, one a     
 small farm and the other an           
 established farm on which there are   
 some historical buildings including   
 a granary on nine staddle stones and  
 a threshing barn. The new buildings   
 are asbestos and include an animal    
 food store and an animal building for 
 cattle kept in deep litter.The small  
 farm has 150 beef cattle, 100 milking 
 cows and 150 sheep. They grow         
 grass for hay and maize for animal    
 feed. There is a small amount of      
 housing in the area. Council          
 houses are being bought by the        
 tenants who are farm workers.         
 There are four nineteenth century     
 houses where the people commute to    
 London. The woodland is in small      
 copses for pheasant rearing.          </content>
