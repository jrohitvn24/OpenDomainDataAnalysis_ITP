		<content>  Newchurch School was built in l874   
 and today there are 27 children aged  
 between 5 and ll on the register. As  
 it is a church-aided school the vicar 
 visits each Friday to take assembly.  
 The headmistress is Mrs. Elizabeth    
 Johnston and the subjects taught are  
 Maths., English, Science, RE, History,
 Geography, PE and music. There is a   
 kitchen attached to the school with a 
 resident cook. School begins at       
 9.00a.m. and ends at 3.30p.m. Leisure 
 activities include swimming at the    
 local baths, three miles away,        
 rounders, netball and we also have a  
 football team that visits other local 
 schools. The two highlights of the    
 year are the prizegiving in June and  
 the Christmas Concert.
