		<content> These areas consist of High Curley,   
 Colony Bog and Strawberry Bottom &amp; are
 mainly heathland &amp; bogs.The heathland 
 wildlife(where one can investigate it)
 consists mainly of ash,birch,pine,oak 
 and willow trees.There are many diff- 
 erent grasses that mingle with ferns  
 and assortment of heathers.Gorse,blac-
 kberry,clover and daisies also grow in
 abundance.Evidence of foxes &amp; badgers,
 rabbits &amp; ants is also seen.The soil  
 is very sandy under a fine layer of   
 gravel.This means that it drains well 
 but is prone to fire.The plants reest-
 ablish themselves fairly easily after 
 each fire,so it does not look barren  
 for long.In the bog areas the same    
 trees are found as well as different  
 ferns and heathers.The grasses are    
 basically the same but some species   
 have longer stems with a more robust  
 texture.                              </content>
