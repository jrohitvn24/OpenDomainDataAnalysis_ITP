{Flockton                              
   The A637 links Huddesfield with     
 junction 38 of the M1 at West Bretton,
 via Flockton. The village of Flockton 
 has therefore up to 300 vehicles an   
 hour travelling through the village, a
 large proportion of the vehicles being
 container wagons and heavy goods      
 vehicles. A weight restriction one way
 through the village eases the villages
 traffic problems.                     
{Netherton}                            
   The weight restriction on H.G.V.    
 vehicles through Flockton poses a     
 problem to Netherton, as vehicles     
 diverted round Flockton are routed    
 through Netherton on the B6117 to and 
 from the M1 Motorway.                 
   There is a proposed by-pass for     
 these villages but due to financiel   
 strictures it has not materialialised.</content>
