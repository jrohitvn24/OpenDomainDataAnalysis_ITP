		<title>11Centenary celebrations cont.</title>
		<content> In June there was another centenary   
 service celebrating the official      
 opening of the parish church in       
 1885.Many past clergymen of Dalton    
 attended.They were joined by men from 
 our parish who had been ordained into 
 the priesthood and who live elsewhere.
 The uniformed organisations were in   
 church as well.The  retired Bishop    
 of Carlisle preached the sermon.After 
 the service all the clergy,the mayor  
 and mayoress and the P.C.C.had lunch  
 in the church centre.                 
 Dalton Church of England School also  
 held a centenary service.First the    
 infants explained a hundred.The       
 headmaster read some exerts from the  
 school log book from 1885. The lower  
 juniors did a sketch going back in    
 time to see how long a church had been
 in Dalton. There has been a church    
 here since at least 1085.             </content>
