		<title>16STREAMS AND MILLS KEMBERTON</title>
		<content>  To the north of Kemberton are Hem    
 Mill and Hem Farm Mill which were fed 
 by the Nedge Brook. This joins the    
 Wesley Brook which runs from north to 
 south along the eastern edge of the   
 parish and is a tributary of the River
 Worfe. Its course can be followed     
 along a series of public footpaths.   
  On the banks of the brook near       
 Evelith there are willow, beech, ash, 
 oak, sycamore, elder and horse        
 chestnut trees. The brook is about    
 3m wide and 10cm deep and was         
 travelling at a third of a cubic metre
 per second. The brook is fenced off   
 and used for private fishing.         
  At Evelith there is a mill, house and
 cottage. Charles II passed through    
 Evelith en route to Madeley in 1651.  
 The area to the south is known as King
 Charles's Wood, although most of the  
 trees have been felled.               </content>
