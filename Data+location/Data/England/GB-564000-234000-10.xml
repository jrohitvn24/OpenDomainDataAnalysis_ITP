		<title>10HOUSES IN GREAT SAMPFORD</title>
		<content> Most of the houses in The Sampfords   
 are detatched.A lot of the houses in  
 this area are cottages or farm        
 houses.Brick is probably the most     
 common material used for building     
 houses in The Sampfords.All the houses
 have electricity and water.Twenty six 
 new houses are being built in Gt.     
 Sampford,six of which will be council 
 houses.All the rest will be private   
 houses.The houses in this area will   
 probably become slightly more valuable
 because of the expansion of Stansted  
 Airport.People will want to live near 
 the airport.There are several         
 bungalows reserved for the            
 elderly.Some of the houses in the area
 are over 500 years old.There are about
 200 houses in the district.
