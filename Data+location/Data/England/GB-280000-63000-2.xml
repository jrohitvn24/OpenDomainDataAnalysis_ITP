		<content> We went to Hemslyn to see how they    
 made pots and Shire horses.  First of 
 all we saw some finished Shire horses 
 which were painted and decorated.     
 Then Mr. Middleton took us down to    
 show us the moulds for the Shire      
 horses which were made of plaster of  
 Paris.  Then Mr. Middleton showed us  
 the potters wheel.  It was not        
 electric.  Then he made some pots to  
 demonstrate.  After that we asked some
 questions.  We found out that they get
 their supplies from Kingsteignton.  We
 found out that he makes twelve pots a 
 day, he is not yet in full production.
 He is very skilled because he used to 
 work in a factory.  His daughter and  
 wife make two to four horses a day.   
 All the horses are hand painted.      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
