		<title>15DEVIZES CANOE RACE.</title>
		<content> This race,which first took place in   
 1948,was started by four members of   
 the Devizes Rover Scouts.             
 It takes place annually at Easter,with
 the start early on Good Friday.       
 The course of 125 miles along the     
 Kennet and Avon Canal and the River   
 Thames,is from Devizes Wharf to       
 Westminster Bridge in London.         
 The crews usually take three to four  
 days to complete the course and many  
 tourists gather in Devizes to watch   
 the start.                            
 Competitors are faced with many miles 
 of hazardous waterway,including a     
 total of seventy-seven locks which    
 they have to navigate.                
 The race which has been described as  
 one of the toughest events in the     
 sporting calendar now attracts an     
 entry of 200 crews including teams    
 from abroad.                          </content>
