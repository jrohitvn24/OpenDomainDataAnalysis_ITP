 St Lawrences Church, Skellingthorpe   
 was destroyed by fire in 1916. All    
 that remained after the fire of the   
 original 17th century church were four
 walls and the square tower. The spire 
 had to be taken down. The church was  
 rebuilt and has remained the same     
 until the present time. There are now 
 plans to build an extention onto the  
 church.                               
 The present vicar is the Rev. Ron Kay.
 There is a church army captain who is 
 Dave Florence. Apart from Sunday      
 services the church is used for       
 weddings and funerals. The people in  
 the church organise clubs and meetings
 including explorers, pathfinders and  
 Young Peoples Fellowship.
