		<content>    The number of families taking an   
annual holiday seems to be influenced  
by the high cost of living at present  
for,while 95% of a survey of 175 local 
families had a holiday in 1983 the     
figure was reduced to 85% in 1984 and, 
although perhaps plans are still not   
made for 1985,only 73% claim to be     
taking one this year.                  
    The proportion of those taking a UK
holiday to those going abroad remains  
constant at 2:1.In Europe,Spain is most
popular with France as second choice.  
Each year a few families travel longer 
distances though visiting relatives is 
sometimes the reason.                  
    Self-catering is the most popular  
type of accommodation with hotels being
second.Caravanning or camping is       
enjoyed by some.                       
    Day outings by car to the seaside, 
London or the pleasure parks are taken.</content>
