		<title>11Marchwood Military Port</title>
		<content>{Marchwood Military Port }is partly in 
 our area.It is a special port just for
 the use of the Army.Civilian shipping 
 only uses it when on military         
 business.It was first established     
 in 1943.Several sorts of ships are    
 based there.They include large troop  
 landing ships, and these are named    
 after King Arthur's knights.They are  
 large ocean going ships and they can  
 carry as many as 18 tanks.They were   
 used in the Falkland's war when Sir   
 Galahad was sunk with some loss of    
 life.There are also smaller landing   
 craft,and hovercraft,which would be   
 used in landing soldiers in times of  
 conflict.There are training facilities
 and maintainance areas where ships and
 vehicles are repaired.There is a good 
 relationship between the Army and the 
 villagers and many of the soldiers    
 live on an estate in Marchwood.       </content>
