		<title>09TROON Cornwall - Transport</title>
		<content> As a growing number of the community  
 in TROON is elderly, they rely very   
 much on public transport.  This is    
 provided by a good bus service to     
 various villages around TROON and     
 regular buses to Camborne, the nearest
 shopping centre, and also buses to    
 Falmouth and Redruth.  There is also a
 good taxi service from a firm based   
 within the village.                   
 For those in the village with cars    
 there is a garage offering servicing  
 facilities, but no filling station.   
 Outside the village however a car is  
 essential as the bus routes only cover
 the one main road through the area.   
 Many of the surronding farmers still  
 use horse drawn carts and the local   
 blacksmith has no other means of      
 transport.
