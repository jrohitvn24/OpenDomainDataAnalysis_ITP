		<title>13Landscape: Wray, Roeburndale</title>
		<content> The landscape of Wray and Roeburndale 
 is very beautiful, speckled with      
 flowers, and with an abundance of     
 deciduous and coniferous trees in     
 varying shades of green. Several      
 different types of field can be seen, 
 some used for grazing land and others 
 where the grass grows long for hay and
 silage. Higher up on the fells is     
 wetland where rushes grow. Looking    
 down from the fells, you can see the  
 patchwork fields spotted with sheep   
 and cows, and below them the village  
 built of Pennine stone, a fairy-tale  
 village in a picture book valley.     
 The rivers, Roeburn and Hindburn, flow
 down from the fells to meet just      
 beyond Wray Bridge in a deep pool     
 called Black Dub.                     
 The entire area is a joy to see.
