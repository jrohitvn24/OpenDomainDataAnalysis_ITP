		<title>07AIRFIELDS-SECOND WORLD WAR</title>
		<content> During the 1939-45 war there were a   
 great many airfields scattered        
 throughout the country and in         
 particular,Lincolshire. Kirmington    
 Airport was one such airfield.        
 Towards the end of the war a British  
 bomber was returning to base after a  
 raid on Germany when it was attacked  
 by a German fighter. Severely damaged 
 the aircraft tried to make its base   
 but failed to do so. The aicraft      
 collided with a tree in Brocklesby    
 Woods demolishing the top half of the 
 tree. The crew of the aircraft were   
 all killed. To commemorate those      
 killed the tree has a plaque nailed to
 its trunk with the names of those     
 killed inscribed. Each year the vicar 
 from Great Limber holds a service at  
 the site.
